AB The aim of this study was to compare the antioxidant capacities and phenolic compound profiles of wild and cultivated Lupinus albus L. seeds. The total phenolic content (TPC), radical scavenging activity, ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and antioxidant activity in an beta-carotene-linoleic acid emulsion were determined. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to identify phenolics. The TPC of lupin seeds ranged from 4.36 to 7.24 mg gallic acid equivalent/g dry matter (d.m.). The dominant phenolics of all genotypes were two p-coumaric acid derivatives (0.74-1.61 and 0.66-1.63 mg/g d.m.) and apigenin-6,8-di-C-glucoside (1.13-1.31 mg/g d.m.). The results of antioxidant assays of wild lupin extracts were similar to or lower than those of the cultivated variety. FRAP and ABTS(center dot+) scavenging activity were correlated with the contents of the more polar p-coumaric acid derivative and apigenin-6,8-di-C-glucoside. Generally, significant differences between cultivated and wild L. albus seeds were not found in antioxidant capacities and phenolic compound contents.

AB Bitterness and astringency are two important quality attributes of green tea infusion, and catechins are the main contributor to the bitterness and astringency. The aim of this work was to quantitatively analyse the bitterness and astringency of green tea infusion according to the concentrations of catechins. The concentration-taste curves of catechins showed a pattern that fit the cubic functions, and their R-2 values were higher than 0.956. The bitterness of green tea was highly correlated with the concentrations of (-)-epigallocatechin gallate and (-)-epicatechin gallate (ECG) (R-2 = 0.7769, p < 0.01), and the astringency (R-2 = 0.7878, p < 0.01) was highly correlated with the concentrations of ECG and flavonol glycosides (myricetin 3-O-galactoside and quercetin-3-O-rutinoside). Taste interactions between different catechins and between catechins and other substances were determined. These results may enhance the understanding of tea chemistry for improving the taste of products from green tea.

AB Chinese jujube is commonly used in folklore medicine. This study aimed to examine the in vivo immunomodulatory activity of two acidic polysaccharides, HP1 and HP2, extracted and purified from Zizyphus jujuba cv. Huizao (which remains extensively unexplored). HP1 and HP2 had the same monosaccharide species and manganese contents, but differed in their molar rhamnose, arabinose, mannose, glucose, galactose and uronic acid contents (7.32 and 35.9%, as galacturonic acid), Mw (68.7 and 111 kDa, respectively), and contents of K, Cr, Cu, Zn, Pb and Ca. Both HP1 and HP2 could significantly (P < 0.05) increase spleen and thymus indices, promote serum hemolysin formation, enhance the phagocytic activity of macrophages and inhibit footpad edema of mice, with HP2 likely being a more consistent and potent immunomodulator. This study clearly demonstrates the potential of Z. jujuba cv. Huizao polysaccharides as immunomodulators and their associated chemical characteristics and working mechanisms.

AB This research aimed to investigate the protective effects of a new mulberry cultivar J33 with simulated gastrointestinal digestion against palmitic acid (PA)-induced lipotoxicity. LC-MS analysis revealed that the contents of four flavonoid glycosides (quercetin rhamnosylhexoside hexoside, quercetin rhamnosylhexoside, quercetin hexoside, kaempferol rhamnosylhexoside) increased after digestion. Besides, mulberry digest (MBD) at 0.5-2 mg/mL significantly reduced PA-induced lipotoxicity in human hepatocytes, while mulberry extract without digestion (MBE) showed no protection. Further investigations demonstrated that the protection of MBD was attributed to two aspects. On the one hand, MBD could attenuate PA-induced oxidative stress by suppressing ROS accumulation, regulating intracellular glutathione and ameliorating mitochondrial dysfunction. On the other hand, MBD could promote PA incorporation into inert triglycerides (TG) to deal with the acute lipid overload, reducing the lipotoxicity caused by PA. Overall, our research might provide a new perspective of mulberry cultivar J33 in ameliorating non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

AB Iron(III) ethylenediaminetetraacetate (Fe(III)EDTA) is widely used in iron fortification for reducing iron deficiency, and its determination is urgently needed. The present work developed a fluorescent method to straightforwardly determine Fe(III)EDTA by using photoluminescent carbon dots (C-dots) with the aid of F- ions as the masking agent of free Fe3+ ions. In the presence of F- ions, only Fe(III)EDTA selectively quenched the photoluminescence of C-dots, and both Fe3+ and Fe2+ as well as other carboxylic acids have no effect on the emission of C-dots. The sensing mechanism was attributed to the ligand-tailored electron transfer process from C-dots to Fe3+. Under optimum conditions, this method showed a linear calibration plot over the Fe(III)EDTA range of 1.0-200 mu mol L-1 and a detection limit of 0.4 mu mol L-1. The proposed method was successfully applied to determine Fe(III)EDTA in real samples with acceptable recoveries of spikes (95%-110%) and repeatability (RSD, 4.2%-9.5%).

AB The first article of a two-article series presents pervaporation (PV) of volatile aroma compounds from fruit juice hydrolates (plum, apple, blackcurrant and cherry). The purpose of this research was to evaluate the effectiveness of fruit juice hydrolates separation on a laboratory scale (inert gas flow pervaporation system) and semi-technical (vacuum pervaporation system) by means of pervaporation. To create precise matrices for hydrolates before and after pervaporation for each of the separated systems, solid phase microextraction (SPME) technique and the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was applied. Sensory analysis confirmed improvement of aroma note of concentrated permeates as compared to feed hydrolates solutions. The results indicated that pervaporation may be applied in condensing aromatic water or fruit juice hydrolate, which may significantly enhance product quality and lengthen shelf life.

AB An accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) with in-cell clean-up method coupled to ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) was developed to determine 21 antibiotics in sea cucumber. The analytes include 10 sulfonamides, 4 fluoroquinolones, 3 amphenicols, 2 beta-lactams, 1 lincosamide and trimethoprim. Optimal parameters of ASE method were obtained at 80 degrees C, 1 static cycle of 5 min with methanol/acetonitrile (1/1, v/v) using 2 g of C18 as adsorbent. Recoveries at 50.1-129.2% were achieved with RSD under 20%. Method detection limits ranged from 0.03 to 2.9 mu g kg(-1). Compared to the reported ultrasound-assisted extraction method, the proposed method offered comparable extraction efficiency for sulfonamides from sea cucumber, but higher for other categories of antibiotics. This validated method was then successfully applied to sea cucumber samples and 9 antibiotics were detected with the highest concentration up to 57.7 mu g kg(-1) for norfloxacin.

AB In this paper, a novel and sustainable process for the fruit dehydration was described. Specifically, edible coatings based on pectin and honey were prepared and used as dehydrating and antimicrobial agents of cut fruit samples, in this way promoting the fruit preservation from irreversible deteriorative processes.
   Pectin-honey coating was tested on apple, cantaloupe melon, mango and pineapple. The analysis were performed also on uncoated dehydrated fruits (control). The coated fruit evidenced enhanced dehydration percentage, enriched polyphenol and vitamin C contents, improved antioxidant activity and volatile molecules profile. Moreover, the antimicrobial activity against Pseudomonas and Escherichia coli was assessed. Finally, morphological analysis performed on fruit fractured surface, highlighted the formation of a non-sticky and homogeneous thin layer. These outcomes suggested that the novel fruit dehydration process, performed by using pectin-honey coating, was able to both preserve the safety and quality of dehydrated fruits, and enhance their authenticity and naturalness.

AB The acorns of Quercus fabri Hance tree, or the mandarin duck fruits have been consumed by locals in the form of noodle, yet there is little scientific study. We found that they have much lower digestibility compared with that of rice flour. Solvent extraction using hexane, dichloromethane, and acetone-ethanol-water (AEW) mixture yielded three fractions but the starch hydrolase inhibitors were only found in the AEW fraction. Using assay-guided fractionation of the extracts, we were able to further separate the active compounds by using Sephadex LH-20 column and characterize the inhibitor chemical identities by LC-MS(n). The main active compounds are ellagitannins including pedunculagin, punicalagin, castalagin, and eucalbanin. Our results indicate that the acorns from Quercus fabri Hance have potential for preparation of low glycemic index foods due to the endogenous starch hydrolase inhibitors.

AB Analysis of the extraction kinetic modelling for natural compounds is essential for industrial application. The second order rate model was applied to estimate the extraction kinetics of conventional solid-liquid extraction (CSLE), ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) and microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) of total polyphenols (TPC) from saffron floral bio-residues at different solid-to-liquid ratios (R-S/L)(1:10, 1:20, 1:30, 1:50 g ml(-1)), ethanol 59% as solvent and 66 degrees C temperature. The optimum solid-to-liquid ratios for TPC kinetics were 1:20 for CLSE, 1:30 for UAE and 1:50 for MAE. The kinetics of total anthocyanins (TA) and antioxidant activity (AA) were investigated for the optimum R-S/L for each method. The results showed a good prediction of the model for extraction kinetics in all experiments (R-2 > 0.99; NRMS 0.65-3.35%). The kinetic parameters were calculated and discussed. UAE, compared with the other methods, had the greater efficiency for TPC, TA and AA.

AB The Chilean wild currants Ribes magellanicum and R. punctatum are a good source of polyphenols. Polyphenolic-enriched extracts (PEEs) from both species were submitted to in vitro colonic fermentation to assess the changes in phenolic composition, antioxidant capacity and inhibition of metabolic syndrome-associated enzymes. The phenolic profiles of the fermented samples showed significant changes after 24 h incubation. Nine metabolites, derived from the microbial fermentation, were tentatively identified, including dihydrocaffeic acid, dihydrocaffeoyl-, dihydroferuloylquinic acid, 1-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-3-(2,4,6-trihydroxyphenyl)propan-2-ol (3,4-diHPP-2-ol), among others. The content of anthocyanins and hydroxycinnamic acids was most affected by simulated colonic conditions, with a loss of 71-92% and 90-100% after 24 h incubation, respectively. The highest antioxidant capacity values (ORAC) were reached after 8 h incubation. The inhibitory activity against the enzyme a-glucosidase was maintained after the fermentation process. Our results show that simulated colonic fermentation exerts significant changes on the polyphenolic composition of these berries, modifying their health-promoting properties.

AB This study aims to develop a formulation of a turmeric- based dye extract using supercritical antisolvent (SAS) technology and different encapsulating polymers to improve the aqueous stability and solubility of curcumin. The dye formulation obtained by SAS consists of a mixture of Eudragit (R) L100 and Pluronic (R) 127 using tween 20 as a surfactant The characterization and quantification of curcumin extracts and the encapsulation product were conducted using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The properties of the dye were determined using SEM, DSC, X-ray diffraction, particle size, zeta potential, and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) to measure antioxidant capacity. The dye formulation contained a curcumin content of 4.45 mu g/mL. The average diameter of the amorphous particles was 5667.4 nm, and the zeta potential was 11.21 mV. The largest aqueous stability and solubility was observed at pH 4. From color comparison with a solution of tartrazine 200 mu g/mL solution of dye formulation based on curcuminoids is equivalent to an approximated 30 mu g/mL tartrazine solution.

AB Radiation is a promising technique for improving the safety and shelf-life of processed foods. In the present investigation, the degradation mechanism and bioactivity improvement of rosmarinic acid (RA) were studied in response to various gamma irradiation doses (10, 20, and 50 kGy). RA exposed to gamma irradiation at 50 kGy was completely degraded and showed an increased inhibitory effect against 3 T3-L1 preadipocyte compare to the parent compound. Structures of the newly generated compounds 2-4 from irradiated RA at 50 kGy were elucidated based on spectroscopic methods, including H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectrometry (MS). Interestingly, compounds 2 and 5 exhibited significantly enhanced anti-adipogenic properties in 3 T3-L1 cells compared to the original compound. These results provide evidence that structural changes in RA induced by gamma irradiation might enhance biological efficacy.

AB Semen sojae praeparatum with homology of medicine and food is a famous traditional Chinese medicine. A simple and effective quality fingerprint analysis, coupled with chemometrics methods, was developed for quality assessment of Semen sojae praeparatum. First, similarity analysis (SA) and hierarchical clusting analysis (HCA) were applied to select the qualitative markers, which obviously influence the quality of Semen sojae praeparatum. 21 chemicals were selected and characterized by high resolution ion trap/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LCIT-TOF-MS). Subsequently, principal components analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) were conducted to select the quantitative markers of Semen sojae praeparatum samples from different origins. Moreover, 11 compounds with statistical significance were determined quantitatively, which provided an accurate and informative data for quality evaluation. This study proposes a new strategy for "statistic analysis-based fingerprint establishment", which would be a valuable reference for further study.

AB Inosine 5'-monophosphate in acidic form and its lithium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, strontium and barium were prepared from the sodium salt, characterized by elemental analysis and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and submitted to thermogravimetry (TG), differential thermal analysis (DTA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetry coupled to infrared spectroscopy (TG-FTIR) of the volatile products evolved during heating. All the salts were hydrated containing from 4 to 7.5 H2O. After dehydration these salts decomposed releasing the nitrogenous base followed by the ribose group, and producing pyrophosphates as final residue. Evolved Gas Analysis (EGA) reveled the release of water, isocyanic acid and hydrocyanic acid during decomposition of the organic moiety. It was observed only water loss up to 200 degrees C. At temperatures above 200 degrees C, the nucleotides were unstable and decomposed, implying that foods containing those additives should be processed below this temperature. Finally, a general mechanism for the decomposition of the inosinates was proposed.

AB A switchable sensor based on N and S co-doped carbon dots (N,S-CDs) was developed to determine ascorbic acid (AA) content in common fruits via fluorescence quenching of N, S-CDs by Fe3+ (off) and recovery by AA (on). TEM showed that the particle size was 2.35-7.95 nm with an average diameter of 5.12 nm. XPS and FTIR confirmed the presence of -OH, -COOH and -NH2 on N,S-CDs surface. UV-vis and FTIR revealed that the coordination of -COOH and -NH2 on N, S-CDs surface with Fe3+ accounted for FL quenching, and the release of -NH2 from coordination complexes due to the reduction of Fe3+ by AA led to partly FL recovery. The sensor allowed detecting AA in the linear range of 10-200 mu mol/L with a LOD of 4.69 mu mol/L. AA contents in common fruits detected by the sensor were in good agreement with the reference method (P > 0.05), indicating a practical fluorescent sensor for AA detection in common fruits.

AB Cinnamaldehyde nanoemulsions were formulated to enable its application in an aqueous environment. The pure cinnamaldehyde nanoemulsions, stabilized by polysorbate 80 (at concentrations > 0.5%), had both a higher stability and smaller droplet size, whereas the emulsions containing hydrophobically modified inulin (HMI) formed a colloidal dispersion with larger particle size. Incorporation of sunflower oil (SO) allowed postponement of Ostwald ripening for a sufficiently long period of time (at least 60 days). Cryo-SEM and droplet size analyses of the nanoemulsions emulsified by HMI revealed no significant changes during storage. Under these conditions, HMI as an emulsifier exhibited a powerful resistance to high salt contents (up to 2 M) and high thermal processing temperatures (90 degrees C). The surfactant type and SO content had no marked influence on the antimicrobial activity of the nanoemulsions. This study provides precious information for a commercial formulation of nanoemulsions with durable physical stability under severe stress conditions.

AB The physiological effects of the Stevia-derived compounds, rebaudioside A, stevioside and steviol have been the focus of several studies due to their use as sweeteners in food. Despite that, little is known about their potential food-drug interactions. In the present study, IPEC-J2 cells and primary hepatocytes were used to investigate the effect of rebaudioside A, stevioside and steviol on cytochrome p450 (CYP) mRNA expression. Moreover, hepatic microsomes were used to investigate direct interactions between the compounds and specific CYP activity. In IPEC-J2 no changes in mRNA expression of CYP1A1 or CYP3A29 were observed with the Stevia-derived compounds. In primary hepatocytes all three tested compounds induced a significant increase in CYP3A29 expression. The tested compounds had no direct effect on specific CYP activity. In conclusion, rebaudioside A, stevioside and steviol induce only minor or no changes to the CYP expression and activity, and are not likely to cause food-drug interactions.

AB We report the development of a molecularly imprinted polymers-surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (MIPs-SERS) method for rapid detection and quantification of a herbicide residue 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) in milk. MIPs were synthesized via bulk polymerization and utilized as solid phase extraction sorbent to selectively extract and enrich 2,4-D from milk. Silver nanoparticles were synthesized to facilitate the collection of SERS spectra of the extracts. Based on the characteristic band intensity of 2,4-D (391 cm(-1)), the limit of detection was 0.006 ppm and the limit of quantification was 0.008 ppm. A simple logarithmic working range (0.01-1 ppm) was established, satisfying the sensitivity requirement referring to the maximum residue level of 2,4-D in milk in both Europe and North America. The overall test of 2,4-D for each milk sample required only 20 min including sample preparation. This MIPs-SERS method has potential for practical applications in detecting 2,4-D in agri-foods.

AB An oyster protein hydrolysates-zinc complex (OPH-Zn) was prepared and investigated to improve zinc bioaccessibility. Zinc ions chelating with oyster protein hydrolysates (OPH) cause intramolecular and intermolecular folding and aggregation, homogeneously forming the OPH-Zn complex as nanoclusters with a Z-average at 89.28 nm (PDI: 0.16 +/- 0.02). The primary sites of zinc-binding in OPH were carboxyl groups, carbonyl groups, and amino groups, and they were related to the high number of charged amino acid residues. Furthermore, formation of the OPH-Zn complex could significantly enhance zinc solubility both under specific pH conditions as well as during simulated gastrointestinal digestion, compared to the commonly used ZnSO4. Additionally, after digestion, either preserved or enhanced antioxidant activity of OPH was found when chelated with zinc. These results indicated that the OPH-Zn complex could be a potential functional ingredient with improved antioxidant bioactivity and zinc bioaccessibility.

AB Fifty-six cocoa bean samples from different origins and status of fermentation were analyzed by a validated hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometry (HILI-CESI-TOF-MS) method. The profile of the low molecular weight carbohydrate (LMWC) was analyzed by high resolution and tandem mass spectrometry, which allowed the identification of mono-, di-, tri- and tetrasaccharides, sugar alcohols and iminosugars.
   This study provides, for the first time in a large set of samples, a comprehensive absolute quantitative data set for the carbohydrates identified in cocoa beans (fructose, glucose, mannitol, myo-inositol, sucrose, melibiose, raffinose and stachyose). Differences in the content of carbohydrates were observed between unfermented (range of 0.9-4.9 g/g DM) and fermented (range 0.1-0.5 g/g DM) cocoa beans.
   The use of multivariate statistical tools allowed the identification of biomarkers suitable for cocoa bean classification according to the status of fermentation, procedure of fermentation employed and number of days of fermentation.

AB A new route to synthesize a covalent interaction-based molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) material for 3-chloro-1,2-propanediol (3-MCPD) inside the nanopores of anodic alumina oxide (AAO) is presented. A series of adsorption experiments showed MIP had good extraction capacity and selectivity for 3-MCPD. In order to evaluate the usability of the MIP nanotubes membrane, a method combining AAO@MIP membrane extraction with gas chromatography - mass spectrometry (GC-MS) detection was developed for determination of chloropropanols. The limits of detection for the proposed method were 0.072 and 0.13 mu g center dot L-1, respectively, for 3-MCPD and 1,3-DCP. The average recoveries of 3-MCPD and 1,3-DCP spiked oil samples at three concentrations (0.01, 0.05 and 0.1 mg center dot kg(-1)) were in the range of 75.6-101.0% with a RSD of 3.3-8.4%, indicating the method would be suitable for determination of chloropropanols in vegetable oils.

AB Interactions of phenolics from green coffee bean flour (GCS) with the matrix of wheat bread have been studied employing direct (electrophoretic and chromatographic techniques) and indirect tests (nutrient digestibility). According to the chromatograms of digests, the antiradical activity of enriched bread was exhibited by free phenolics. An increase the area of chromatograms and some additional peaks observed for enriched bread may confirm some interactions of proteins with phenolics. The electrophoretic profile of these extracts showed that the band corresponding to a protein with molecular mass of 38 kDA had much higher intensity in enriched bread. Electrophoretic analysis of pellets remaining after digestion revealed GCS dose-dependent differences in bands corresponding to proteins with molecular masses of 52 kDa and 23 kDa. The relative digestibility of both starch and proteins was slightly decreased by addition of GCS; however, these changes did not exceed 10%, which justifies the use of this functional material.

AB In this study, zein, propylene glycol alginate (PGA) and surfactant ternary complexes were fabricated by anti-solvent co-precipitation method. Two types of surfactants (rhamnolipid and lecithin) were applied to generate zein-PGA-rhamnolipid (Z-P-R) and zein-PGA-lecithin (Z-P-L) ternary complexes, respectively. Results showed that the surfactant types significantly affected the properties of ternary complexes. The formation of ternary complexes was mainly due to the non-covalent interactions such as hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interaction and hydrophobic interactions among zein, PGA and surfactants. Moreover, the thermal stability of ternary complexes was enhanced with increasing the levels of both surfactants. Notably, ternary complex dispersions exhibited better stability against pH from 2 to 8. Furthermore, a compact network structure was observed in Z-PR ternary complex, while Z-P-L ternary complex remained the spherical structure. These findings would provide new insights into the development of novel delivery system and expand the options, when zein-based complexes were utilized under different environment conditions.

AB The aim of the current work was to use hyperspectral imaging (HSI) in the spectral range 1000-2500 nm to quantitatively predict fermentation index (FI), total polyphenols (TP) and antioxidant activity (AA) of individual dry fermented cocoa beans scanned on a single seed basis, in a non-destructive manner. Seventeen cocoa bean batches were obtained and 10 cocoa beans were used from each batch. PLS regression models were built on 170 samples. The developed HSI predictive models were able to quantify three quality-related parameters with sufficient performance for screening purposes, with external validation R-2 of 0.50 (RMSEP=0.27, RPD=1.40), 0.70 (RMSEP=34.1 mg ferulic acid g(-1), RPD=1.77) and 0.74 (60.0 mmol Trolog kg(-1), RPD=1.91) for FI, TP and AA, respectively. The calibrations were subsequently applied at a single bean and pixel level, so that the distribution was visualised within and between single seeds (chemical images). HSI is thus suggested as a promising approach to estimate cocoa bean composition rapidly and non-destructively, thus offering a valid tool for food inspection and quality control.

AB After tea leaves, tea (Camellia sinensis) flowers are becoming a second tea plant resource because they contain not only functional metabolites similar to those found in tea leaves, but also predominant amounts of functional metabolites that only occur in tea leaves in small amounts. 1-Phenylethanol (1PE) is a predominant aroma compound found in tea flowers. A 1PE synthase in tea flowers was isolated, functionally characterized, and shown to have the highest catalytic efficiency for the conversion of acetophenone (AP). To determine why 1PE accumulates more in tea flowers than other plants, we compared their 1PE contents and used a stable isotope labeling method to elucidate the 1PE biosynthetic route. Supplementation with [H-2(8)]L-phenylalanine and [H-2(5)]AP suggested that most plants containing the enzyme/gene catalyzed the conversion of AP to 1PE. Furthermore, the availability of AP derived from L-phenylalanine was responsible for the difference in 1PE accumulation between tea flowers and other plants.

AB Food allergy is one of the most important health issues worldwide. In Taiwan, current literature suggests shrimps and crabs are the most common causes of food allergy, and are frequently associated with acute allergic reactions such as urticaria, atopic dermatitis, and asthma. However, knowledge regarding the shrimp allergens remains limited. Thus, there is an urgent need to establish comprehensive information for elucidating underlying triggers for food allergy. In this study, whiteleg shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) was used to evaluate the IgE-binding properties of various shrimp proteins to 7 allergic patients' sera by western blot. A 63 kDa protein was found in raw and cooked shrimp bound to specific-IgEs in 7 and 4 patients' sera, respectively. This protein was further identified as pyruvate kinase based on the proteomic mass spectrometry. This study identifies an important shrimp allergen unique to Taiwan and further testing and prevention measures might be implemented in the allergen analysis.

AB Isorenierantene was reported to be an aromatic carotenoid and has become a food ingredient, mainly from smear cheese, which possesses special antioxidant ability and significant photoprotective effect. In this paper, the interaction of isorenieratene with human serum albumin (HSA) was explored and compared with that of nonaromatic carotenoids using multi-spectroscopic methods and docking simulations. The results suggested isorenieratene could bind to HSA through a static quenching mechanism. The binding processes were spontaneous and exothermic, and the binding between isorenieratene and HSA was mainly driven by hydrophobic forces and electrostatic attraction. Synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) experiments showed isorenieratene may change the secondary structure of HSA and the micro-environment of its amino acids. Additionally, isorenieratene showed higher stability during the binding process than did nonaromatic carotenoids. Docking simulation indicated isorenieratene may bind to HSA at site II.

AB Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a disease with a prevalence of 9.4% in Mexicans. Its etiology is complex involving environmental and genetic factors. The aim of this study was to analyse the association between PPARG rs1801282, PPARGC1A rs8192678, VEGFA rs2010963, ADRA2A rs553668, KCNQ1 rs2237892, SIRT1 rs7896005, IGF2BP2 rs4402960, and UCP3 rs3781907 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) with T2D and metabolic traits in a case-control study of a population from Mexico City. A total of 831 blood samples of non-diabetic, with healthy control participants (416) and individuals with T2D (415) were collected over a five-year period. After DNA extraction, genotyping was performed with TaqMan probes using real-time PCR. The genotypes were analysed for association with T2D in linear and logistic regressions adjusting for age, sex, and body mass index using the dominant, recessive, and additive models with a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons p < 0.001 and for association with related T2D traits fixed with a p < 2.3 X 10(-4). The univariate analysis gives a significant (p < 1 x 10(-4)) for sex, triglycerides, and HOMA-IR. Significant association with T2D was found for ADRA2A rs553668 under the recessive model (OR = 3.640 and 95% CI of 2.330-5.690 (p < 1 x 10(-4)); statistical power 0.999) and under the additive model (OR = 1.640 and 95% CI of 1.340-2.000 (p < 1 x 10(-4)); statistical power 0.997). Variants PPARG rs1801282, PPARGC1A rs8192678, SIRT1 rs7896005, IGF2BP2 rs4402960 and UCP3 rs3781907 were nominally associated (p > 0.001 and < 0.050). Results describe association of ADRA2A rs553668 with T2D in a Mexican population. Variants with nominal association with T2D require to be replicated in additional Mexican populations.

AB Polyamines (PAs) in plants are growth substrates with functions similar to phytohormones. Although they contribute to diverse processes, little is known about their role in stress responses, especially for perennial woody plants. We conducted a genome-wide investigation of 18 sequences involved in PA biosynthesis in the genome of apple (Malus domestica). Further analysis was performed to construct a phylogenetic tree, analyze their protein motifs and gene structures. In addition, we developed their expression profiles in response to stressed conditions. Both MDP0000171041 (MdSAMDC1) and MDP0000198590 (MdSPDS1) were induced by alkaline, salt, ABA, cold, and dehydration stress treatments, suggesting that these genes are the main contributors to activities of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.50) and spermidine synthase (EC 2.5.1.16) in apple. Changes in PA biosynthesis under stress conditions indicated that spermidine and spermine are more essential than putrescine for apple, especially when responding to alkaline or salt stress. When seedlings of M. hupehensis Rehd. were supplied with exogenous PAs, their leaves showed less chlorosis under alkaline stress when compared with untreated plants. This application also inhibited the decline in SPAD levels and reduced relative electrolyte leakage in those stressed seedlings, while increasing their concentration of active iron. These results suggest that the alteration in PA biosynthesis confers enhanced tolerance to alkaline stress in M. hupehensis Rehd.

AB Cryptosporidium and Giardia are common parasites of ruminant livestock worldwide. These parasites are associated with diarrhoea outbreaks in young goats (pre-weaning), but the impacts on health and productivity for older goats (post-weaning) are not well understood. Here we show Cryptosporidium faecal shedding is associated with reduced growth and diarrhoea in goats aged approximately 9-15 months. Goats were sampled four times at one-month intervals. Faecal shedding for a range of pathogens were determined using quantitative PCR and sequencing (Cryptosporidium, Giardia, Eimeria, Salmonella, Campylobacter), and microscopy (trichostrongylid nematode worm egg count and Entamoeba). Cryptosporidium faecal shedding was associated with 1.5 kg lower growth for the one-month period following sampling. Specifically, C. xiaoi was associated with 1.9 kg lower growth in the following month. This is the first report of production impacts associated with C. xiaoi in ruminants older than 3 months of age. Cryptosporidiwn shedding was associated with an over 4-fold increase in risk of diarrhoea, with C. parvum associated with 10-fold and C. ubiquitum associated with 16-fold increase in risk of diarrhoea. Notably, C. xiaoi shedding was not associated with increased risk of diarrhoea. Giardia shedding was associated with looser faecal consistency, but not diarrhoea. Higher Eimeria oocyst counts were weakly associated with lower live weight, poorer body condition and looser faecal consistency. Shedding of other enteric pathogens were not associated with impacts on live weight, growth or diarrhoea risk. This study challenges the two notions that Cryptosporidium infections only impact health and productivity of goats during the pre-weaning period, and that Cryptosporidium (and specifically C. xiaoi) infections in the absence of diarrhoea are asymptomatic. Recognising the potential for impacts of Ctyptosporidium infection on growth rates in the absence of diarrhoea will support improved design for experiments testing impacts of Cryptosporidium on ruminant health and production. Improved understanding of the role of protozoan infections on animal health has implications for the management of goats in order to reduce adverse impacts on farm profitability, animal welfare and public health risk.

AB This study examined the relationship between two serologic assays which quantify anti-Leishmania antibodies (a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and a time-resolved immunofluorometric assay (TR-IFMA)) and selected acute phase proteins (APPs) and analytes related to protein concentration. Data were obtained from 205 canine serum samples from different veterinary clinics located in an area in which canine leishmaniosis (CanL) is endemic. The samples were submitted to the Interdisciplinary Laboratory of Clinical Analysis (Interlab-UMU), University of Murcia, Spain, for analysis. The biochemical analytes evaluated were serum ferritin, C-reactive protein (CRP), haptoglobin, paraoxonase-1 (PON-1) and albumin as APPs and total proteins and globulins as indicative analytes of protein concentration. Samples were submitted for the initial diagnosis of CanL, or to monitor the response to treatment in patients with CanL. The evaluation of the biochemical analytes did not show differences between Leishmania-seronegative and Leishmania-seropositive dogs. However, dogs with high antibody titers showed more pronounced clinicopathological abnormalities. Both serological assays had correlations of different significance with the biochemical analytes, showing higher significant correlations with total proteins and globulins than with the rest of the analytes. When the samples submitted for diagnosis and treatment monitoring were analyzed separately, serological assays showed lower correlation in samples for treatment monitoring (r = 0.531, p < 0.0001) than in samples for diagnosis (r = 0.769, p < 0.0001). In addition, higher correlations were found between TR-IFMA and analytes such as serum ferritin and CRP in the treatment monitoring group than with the ELISA. These results may help to clarify the relationship between anti-Leishmania antibody levels and selected biochemical analytes related to inflammation and protein concentration in CanL.

AB This study reports the comparative evaluation of the activity of carvacrol, thymol, eugenol and their respective acetylated derivatives (carvacrol acetate, thymol acetate and eugenol acetate) on Rhipicephalus microplus, to verify the possible influence of the acetate group. The acetylated derivatives were prepared from reactions of the phenolic compounds with acetic anhydride/pyridine. The formation of the products was confirmed by analysis of hydrogen and carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1 and C-13 NMR) spectra. The larval packet test was used to evaluate the acaricidal activity, with concentrations of 0.312, 0.625, 1.25, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, 10.0 and 15.0 mg/mL. Thymol and carvacrol resulted in 100% mortality starting at the concentration of 2.5 mg/mL, while the same was observed for carvacrol acetate starting at the concentration of 5.0 mg/mL. For the other treatments, 100% mortality was only achieved in the groups treated with the highest concentration (15.0 mg/mL). The LC50 and LC90 values (mg/mL) of carvacrol acetate (2.49, 4.21), thymol acetate (2.97, 8.52) and eugenol acetate (4.25, 13.10) were higher than those for the corresponding precursor molecules carvacrol (0.83, 2.02), thymol (1.26, 2.21) and eugenol (2.77, 5.35). The acetylation process did not enhance the activity of these substances on unengorged larvae of R. microplus, since the precursor substances (carvacrol, thymol and eugenol) had greater efficacy.

AB The larval development assay has been used for many years to measure the sensitivity of the free-living life stages of trichostrongylid nematodes to anthelmintics. The assay has applications in both drug discovery and the diagnosis of drug resistance. We revisited the usefulness of the larval development assay for diagnosis of resistance to levamisole using field-derived isolates of Haemonchus contortus and Trichostrongylus colubriformis showing varying levels of resistance to this drug in vivo. Each of the resistant isolates showed a plateau in their larval development assay dose-response at the highest drug concentrations tested, representing a highly-resistant fraction, amounting to between 6.9 and 55.1% of the populations. The remaining population fractions for the resistant isolates showed IC50 values from 1.4- to 17.8-fold higher than their corresponding susceptible isolate of the same species. We used a data set from the DrenchRite (R) test user manual to derive equations describing the relationship between the IC50 values for these low / moderate resistance components of each population and in vivo drug efficacy, and then used these equations to estimate the expected in vivo efficacy of levamisole against this population component of each isolate. A combination of this expected efficacy, with the known zero efficacy of the drug in vivo against the highly-resistant population fractions in each isolate, allowed us to calculate a predicted drug efficacy for the whole population for each isolate. The predicted levamisole efficacies for the three resistant H. contortus isolates were 88.8, 84.1 and 43.7%. These compared favourably with the actual efficacy of the drug against these isolates as determined in faecal egg count reduction tests or total worm count studies: 79, 66.3 and 40.6%, respectively. Similarly, for T. colubriformis, predicted efficacies of 82.0 and 1.8% compared favourably with the actual efficacies of 65-92% and 0%, respectively. This study illustrates the usefulness of the larval development assay as a diagnostic tool for predicting in vivo efficacy of levamisole against H. contortus and T. colubriformis.

AB Toxoplasma gondii rhoptry proteins (TgROPs) have been considered the main targets and indicator molecules for immune diagnosis and prophylaxis because they present during the initial process of invasion. The aim of this study was to evaluate the protective effect of a TgROP35 DNA vaccine on experimental mice subjected to T. gondii challenge. The effect of intramuscularly injecting the genetic vaccine pVAX-ROP35 into BALB/c mice was evaluated, by first inserting the TgROP35 sequence into the pVAX I eukaryotic expression vector. The levels of IgG, IgG1 and IgG2a in pVAX-ROP35-vaccinated animals were integrally increased. Cytokine profile analyses revealed that IFN-gamma, IL-2 and IL-10 levels were significantly increased, while there were no significant differences in IL-4 expression between the pVAX-ROP35 immunized and control groups. Additionally, we found that immunization with pVAX-ROP35 significantly prolonged the survival time (13.90 +/- 1.97 days) of mice after challenge infection with the virulent T. gondii RH strain compared with that in non-vaccinated control animals (mice died within 10 days). Moreover, the number of brain cysts (1450 +/- 287) in the animals subjected to pVAX-TgROP35 vaccination decreased remarkably (P < 0.05) compared to that in the blank control mice (2333 +/- 473). Furthermore, the size of brain cysts in the pVAX-TgROP35 group was significantly smaller than that in the blank control, PBS and pVAXI groups. The findings indicated that intense cell-mediated and humoural immunity was triggered and that defence mechanisms against T. gondii were partially induced after vaccination by TgROP35.

AB The occurrence of acute kidney injury in canine babesiosis is not well documented. Furthermore, interpretation of urine specific gravity (USG) to assess renal concentrating ability is hampered by the frequent presence of hemoglobinuria in this disease.
   This cross-sectional study aimed to test the hypothesis that renal azotemia (RA) is underdiagnosed according to current canine babesiosis literature by determining its occurrence at presentation, using urine osmolality instead of USG to measure urinary concentration. The second objective was to examine potential associations between the presence of RA and selected clinical and laboratory variables at presentation. Medical records available from 3 previously performed prospective data collections were reviewed retrospectively. Client-owned dogs that were diagnosed with babesiosis caused by Babesia rossi, were included if a complete blood count, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis was performed at admission. Urine osmolality was measured to identify dogs with RA. Differences between dogs with RA and dogs without RA were assessed by nonparametric statistics.
   One hundred and fifty-two dogs were included, of which 26 (17%) were azotemic at admission. The occurrence of RA was 14% (21/152), hence 81% (21/26) of all azotemic dogs were diagnosed with RA. In contrast, when diagnosis of RA was based on an admission USG < 1.030, only 23% (6/26) of the azotemic dogs would have been considered to have RA. Several signalment and clinicopathological findings were found to be associated with the presence of RA, including older age, and the presence of collapse, hypoglycemia, hyperphosphatemia, cerebral babesiosis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Lastly, survival at discharge was significantly lower in dogs diagnosed with RA at presentation.
   Our results clarified that RA is more common than previously reported in B. rossi. This study also demonstrated that USG determination is not a reliable method to evaluate renal concentrating ability in azotemic dogs with babesiosis. Thus, if available, urine osmolality should be part of the diagnostic work-up of dogs infected with B. rossi to avoid misclassification of dogs with RA as having prerenal azotemia. If urine osmolality cannot be measured, clinicians should realize that most azotemic dogs with B. rossi infection have RA.

AB The effective dose of an injectable prodrug, named compound alpha prodrug, against immature and adult Fasciola hepatica in experimentally infected sheep was determined. In a first experiment, 30 sheep were infected with Fasciola hepatica on day 0 and 50. After microscopic detection of faecal eggs on day 80, groups (n = 6) 1 to 3 were treated with 6, 8 and 10 mg/kg of the experimental water-soluble prodrug compound alpha intramuscularly, respectively. Group 4 was treated with closantel and group 5 remained untreated. Copromicroscopical examinations were made on day 0, 80 and 108. On day 110, trematodes were collected from the bile ducts. Fasciolicide efficacy was assessed as a percentage of fluke-egg and adult-fluke reduction. Fluke length was also recorded. In a second experiment aimed to assess the fasciolicide activity of compound alpha prodrug against four-week-old flukes, 12 sheep were infected on day 0 and allocated into two groups (n = 6). On day 50 post infection, group A was treated with the experimental water-soluble prodrug compound alpha at 6 mg/kg/IM and B remained untreated. Fasciolicide activity was assessed on day 80 after collection, microscopic observation and measurement of flukes present in the parenchyma for immature stages and on day 108 for adults. Egg output decreased 91.2, 96.0, 98.8 and 94.9% for groups 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. Compound alpha prodrug cleared 97.6%, 98.51% and 100% of adult stages in a dose-dependent manner. Closantel killed 81.95% flukes. Regarding the second experiment, 81.2% efficacy was achieved. Immature flukes were significantly smaller in the treated group. It is concluded that the intramuscular application of compound alpha prodrug exerted fasciolicide efficacy against adults of Fasciola hepatica.

AB Given the ever-increasing levels of anthelmintic resistance in livestock parasites globally, it is recommended to use parasite fecal egg counts to make treatment decisions and to evaluate treatment efficacy. The consensus in equine parasitology is to use a flotation medium with a specific gravity (SG) of >= 1.20 to float the main parasite egg types of interest in egg counting techniques. However, the density of common equine endoparasite eggs has been sparsely investigated. Equine tapeworm eggs are known to be particularly difficult to determine and count in fecal samples. It is unknown whether this could be because of differences in egg density. The aim of this study was to provide estimates of relative densities for equine ascarid, strongyle, and tapeworm eggs. Six aqueous glucose-salt solutions with specific gravities ranging from 1.06 to 1.16 were made and placed from most to least dense into thirteen 15 mL centrifuge tubes. Concentrated aqueous suspensions of the three types of endoparasite eggs were placed on top of each tube. These tubes were then centrifuged at 800 g for 20 min and each layer of flotation solution was carefully pipetted and transferred to a McMaster egg counting slide. Egg type and count were recorded for each specific gravity layer. Each egg was assigned a specific gravity based on the specific gravity layer it was observed in. In a second trial of this study, five similar flotation media were made ranging from 1.02 to 1.10 and were used in four subsequent replicates. In total between the two trials, the mean egg SGs of Anoplocephala perfoliata (n = 3811), Parascaris spp. (n = 3478), and strongylid type eggs (n = 9291) were 1.0636 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.0629-1.0642), 1.0903 (95% CI: 1.0897-1.0909), and 1.0453 (95% CI: 1.0448-1.0458), respectively. The three egg types were statistically different from each other (p < 0.0001). This is the first time that the specific gravity of equine strongylid and Anoplocephala perfoliata eggs has been determined. With a tapeworm egg density demonstrated to be between that of strongylids and Parascaris spp., the poor recovery of tapeworm eggs in equine fecal samples must have other explanations.

AB Cyathostomins comprise around 50 parasite species of equids, offering a great challenge regarding their individual identification. The objective of our work was to improve identification of infective third stage larvae (L3) with a morphological key supplemented with detailed scientific illustrations based on our research and available literature. The highlighted features were; the number, arrangement, and shape of intestinal cells (IC), general features and the total body length of the eight different Cyathostomin sensu latum types (Type A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H), Gyalocephalus capitatus, and Posteriostomum spp. Due to variability, we were unable to define final body length measurements to differentiate L3 of cyathostomins. However, IC characteristics displayed a higher difference between L3 types than total body length. Through the number and arrangement of IC, 14 species were classified within three larval types. The classification of L3 into distinct larval types sensu latum gives us the advantage of reducing the number of probable species presented in equine faecal samples using a low-cost technique when monitoring the parasite fauna present in individual horses or on the farm level. The present improved identification key shall increase the diagnostic capabilities of classical equine parasitology techniques, using general L3 morphology thereby pragmatically improving regional and transnational epidemiological and biodiversity studies. The present key may also assist in defining the cyathostomin community in cyathostominosis clinical cases and within drug resistant populations across different management systems and geographical locations.

AB Non-tsetse transmitted Trypanosoma evansi infection (Surra) is one of the most important diseases of camels in north and east Africa and of buffalo and cattle in Asia. Early, accurate and feasible diagnosis is a crucial step towards the control of Surra.
   Dry format of loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) diagnostics for the detection of T. evansi was developed, where the detection limit was determined as to equivalent to one parasite per reaction. The assay was validated by testing blood from 48 camels clinically diagnosed to have Surra, which all tested negative microscopically and revealed 43 (89.6%) to be positive for T. evansi when tested by the dry-LAMP. Furthermore, DNA extracted from a randomly selected subset of 20 of these blood samples were then subjected to RoTat1.2-PCR (TaKara Ex Taq), with 14 matching results, with six that were positive by dry-LAMP and negative by PCR. The kappa value of dry-LAMP applied to direct blood was 0.4211, indicating moderate agreement to RoTat 1.2-PCR. In addition, 103 genomic DNA extracted from camels' blood were tested by both dry-LAMP and RoTat1.2-PCR revealed 67 matching results and 31 positive by dry-LAMP and negative by PCR and a further five positives by PCR and negative by dry-LAMP. This novel dry-LAMP method is more sensitive than conventional PCR, direct (without DNA extraction step), is user friendly and does not require cold chain or highly trained personnel.

AB The distribution of Hematobia irritans is not homogeneous in cattle populations. Generally, between 15% and 30% of bovines carry more than 50% of the flies, and higher infestations occur in bulls. In this study, the effect of treating the bulls with ear tags containing 40% diazinon on the infestation of flies on the herd during the breeding season was evaluated. Four groups of cattle were made, each containing one bull and 35 Braford cows. Groups 1 and 2 were on pastures in highlands. Groups 3 and 4 were on pastures in lowlands. At the beginning of the trial, each bull from Groups 1 and 3 was treated with an ear tag. Bulls from Groups 2 and 4 remained untreated. Weekly, for 10 weeks, horn flies were counted from each bull and 15 cows from each group. A repeated measures linear mixed model was used with cows as random effects. The number of horn flies in the treated groups was lower than that in the untreated group, suggesting that selective treatment of bulls could be an effective strategy to control horn flies on the herd. The number of flies was higher in the lowland than that in the highland groups, suggesting an effect of the environment on horn fly infestations. In addition, we estimated the cow level predictions from the model to estimate the cow effect on fly counts, and we compared those values with the observed weekly quartiles for each group. Fly-susceptible cows were defined as those for which the infestation of flies appeared in the upper quartile more than 50% of the weeks and in the lower quartile less than 20% of the weeks. In contrast, a fly-resistant cow was defined as one for which the fly counts appeared in the lower quartile more than 50% of the weeks and in the upper quartile less than 20% of the weeks. In all, 8.3% of the cows were susceptible and 15% were resistant. These results may be used to selectively treat bulls or to treat the bulls and the most susceptible cows during the breeding season.

AB Pituitary homeobox 2 (PITX2) plays crucial roles in embryogenesis, ontogenesis, growth, and development via the Wnt/beta-catenin and POU1F1 pathways. To better understand the characteristics and genetic effects of the cattle PITX2 gene, we identified alternative PITX2 splicings, examined the effects of the spliced variants on mRNA expression levels in tissues, and then used association analyses to explore the relationships between a PITX2 deletion genetic variant and growth traits in 750 native Chinese cattle. An unreported spliced variant of PITX2, designated here as PITX2-V1, was identified in cattle using in silica cloning and RT-PCR. The entire coding sequence of PITX2 is 978 bp, encoding 325 amino acids, whereas that of PITX2-V1 is 357 by encoding 118 amino acids. Cattle PITX2 exhibited both a perfect homeodomain and an OAR domain, but PITX2-V1 lacked the homeodomain. Analyses with qRT-PCR showed that the expression level of PITX2 in cattle testis was very low, and PITX2-V1 was only very slightly expressed in the brain and testis. Furthermore, a 24 by deletion was detected within PITX2 intron, and the different genotypes were significantly associated with growth traits (e.g., body height, body length, heart girth) in four cattle breeds (P < 0.05). These results are of direct benefit to future cattle breeding, and provide new insights into the characteristics and functions of cattle PITX2 gene.

AB The Ginkgo biloba L. chichi is a unique organ. To explore the molecular mechanisms underlying the ontogenesis of G. biloba chichi, we used RNA-seq to analyse the transcriptome profile of rooted chichi at two developmental stages (ch1 and ch2) and nearby tissues (ck), and each sample had three biological replicates. A total of 57.74 Gb of clean bases were generated in nine cDNA libraries. These bases were de novo assembled into 68,277 unigenes with average length of 844 bp, and 51.47% of the unigenes had a match in at least one public database. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in chl vs. ck and ch2 vs. ck were 2748 and 8594, respectively. The DEGs involved in the auxin signal pathway, auxin polar transport, storage-related proteins, and the cell cycle pathway might play roles in the ontogenesis of chichi. The quantitative real-time PCR results were closely correlated with transcriptome data. The transcriptome resources generated in the current study provide gene expression profiles and differential expression profiles of G. biloba chichi and offer an essential resource to probe the molecular mechanisms underlying the ontogenesis of G. biloba chichi.

AB Target of rapamycin (TOR) regulates cellular homeostasis by coordinating cellular growth pathways in response to different environmental signals. Rapamycin, an allosteric TOR complex 1 (TORC1) inhibitor, has proven to be invaluable for elucidating various aspects of the TOR signalling pathway; however, its applications are limited due to its inability to completely suppress TORC2. In the present study, we examined the effects of a newly discovered potent TOR inhibitor, Torin2, which inhibits both TORC1 and TORC2, on Saccharomyces cerevisiae growth. Genome-scale expression profiling of Torin2 treated yeast cells showed an expression profile similar to that of other TOR inhibitors such as rapamycin and caffeine. Distinct inhibition of cell growth by Torin2 treatment is indicated by the fact that a smaller number of transcripts are altered, compared to the changes after rapamycin and caffeine treatments. Our results revealed that Torin2 leads to increased expression of the calcineurin pathway genes favouring a synergistic therapeutic response of Torin2 in combination with calcineurin inhibitors. Further, Torin2 causes defective bud site selection during asymmetric cell division, indicating a role of TOR signalling in regulation of the budding pattern. Torin2 treated yeast cells exhibit increased expression of metalloreductases which affects iron homeostasis leading to iron toxicity. Notably, the enhanced expression of TOR1 and TOR2 rescue the Torin2 augmented iron toxicity of yeast cell. This study has revealed novel conduits and our results suggest that using Torin2 will enable the dissection of TORC2 mediated functions of the TOR signalling pathway.

AB Regnase-1 is not only a key component in maintaining intracellular homeostasis but also a critical negative regulator in preventing autoimmune diseases and cancer development. To keep homeostatic state, Regnase-1 has to be maintained at a desired level in multiple cell types. However, the molecular mechanism of keeping a certain transcriptional level of Reganase-1 is largely unknown. In this study, we found a super-enhancer (Reg-1 SE) around Regnase-1 gene is able to control the homeostatic expression of Regnase-1. Functional inhibition of super-enhancers through BRD4 inhibitors or genetic silence of key components such as BRD4 and MEDI. significantly downregulates Regnase-1 expression at multiple cell types. Consistently, treatment of JQ1 or I-BET 762 dramatically decreases the protein level of Regnase-1. By analyzing Regnase-1 gene, the distribution of H3K27Ac is highly enriched at a 8 kb DNA region around the second intron. Several DNA elements at the second intron are highly conserved between different species. Deletion of the second intron by CRISPR-Cas9 technology significantly reduces the expression of Regnase-1. JO1 or I-BET-762 failed to further downregulate the expression of Regnase-1 in cells without the second intron. Our result reveals a novel molecular mechanism by which a super-enhancer around the second intron regulates the expression of Regnase-1, and in turn maintains a desired level of Regnase-1.

AB Idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH) is characterized by low levels of gonadotropins and delayed or absent sexual development. Most of the patients are diagnosed in late adolescence or early adulthood. Determining the diagnosis of IHH in prepubertal patients can be challenging. Making a timely, correct diagnosis has important clinical implications. Here we aimed to identify the genetic cause of IHH in three prepubertal siblings from a Chinese Han family and give appropriate treatment advice. Using whole exome sequencing (WES), we identified a novel homozygous GNRHR mutation (NM_000406; c.364C > T, p.L122F) in two prepubertal boys with cryptorchidism and micropenis. Sanger sequencing showed that their younger asymptomatic sister also had the homozygous GNRHR mutation. This mutation was inherited from the father and the mother. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that in permeabilized cells, expression of the mutant receptor on the cell membrane was significantly lower than that of wild-type. Calcium mobilization assays demonstrated that c.364C > T in the GNRHR gene is a complete loss-of-function mutation that caused IHH. These results may contribute to the genetic diagnosis of the three prepubertal siblings with IHH. According to this diagnosis, timely hormonal treatment can be given for the three prepubertal patients to induce pubertal development, especially for the asymptomatic female.

AB The association studies of several immune-diseases with the 3' Regulatory Region 1 (3'RR1) increased interest on the role that the region plays in the immune-regulation. The 3'RR1 is a polymorphic region on human chromosome 14832, acting as a cis-regulative element on the Immunoglobulin constant-gene locus recently considered as super-enhancer. The human 3'RR1 share large sequences with its paralogous 3'RR2, at high level of similarity. Thus, a focused investigation was necessary to discriminate each one of the duplicated components of the two regions and its specific contribution to the immunologic phenotype. One of the duplicated elements is the hs1.2 enhancer. The 3'RR1 alleles of this enhancer were demonstrated to play a role in autoimmune diseases, including Psoriasis. We sequenced a specific region internal to the 3'RR1 in hs1.2 homozygous subjects, to detect SNPs associated to the main alleles of the enhancer. We identified two alternative nine-SNPs haplotypes strictly linked to the allele *1 and *2 of hs1.2, that could be used as markers to further investigate the region and associations to pathology. Finally, we identified two haplotypes, namely E2A1 and E2A2, that strongly support the hypothesis of a relevant effect of the rs35216181 in the onset of Psoriasis when the *2 allele is present.

AB To explore the role of genetic factors in the pathogenesis of hypertension, our study investigated the gender specific association between four polymorphisms in the Apelin/APJ gene and hypertension risk in southeastern Chinese population. All participants including 645 hypertensive patients and 362 normotensive controls were genotyped for 4 gene polymorphisms associated with hypertension susceptibility including Apelin (rs909656, rs5975126) and APJ (rs10501367, rs11544374). According to genotype analysis, for male subjects, the frequencies of genotypes (P = 0.046 and 0.046, respectively) of rs10501367 and rs11544374 revealed significant differences between the hypertension and control groups. Moreover, for female subjects, there was significant difference on the genotype distribution of rs11544374 between two groups (P = 0.046). The association of rs10501367 with hypertension was significant for males under additive models and recessive models, even after adjusting for age, BMI, fasting glucose and waistline. Besides, significant association was observed for rs11544374 in females under additive models. As for haplotype analysis, haplotype T-A (in order of rs10501367 and rs11544374) in APJ gene was marginally overrepresented in controls (17.9%) compared to patients with hypertension (11.6%) in males (P = 0.003). The mutation of polymorphism rs10501367 in APJ gene decreased risk of hypertension in Chinese males.

AB Drought stress at the reproductive stage of rice crop leads to a huge loss in grain yield. Identification and introgression of large effect drought tolerant QTLs are necessary to develop drought-tolerant rice varieties. Compared to the high-density linkage maps, widely spaced markers lead to the identification of QTLs with large confidence intervals which are difficult to incorporate in a breeding program. A previously generated geno-typing-by-sequencing (GBS) based linkage map consisting of 4748 SNP markers was used to map QTLs in Cocodrie x N-22 recombinant inbred line (RIL) population. Twenty-one QTLs were discovered for days to flowering (DTF), plant height (PH), leaf rolling score (LRS), plant dry matter content (DM), spikelet fertility (SF), grain yield (GY), yield index (YI), and harvest index (HI) under drought stress. A major QTL qPH1.38 was identified in a narrow confidence interval on chromosome 1. The QTLs, qDTF3.01 and qPH1.38, overlapped with the previously identified QTL qDTY1.I and Hd9, respectively. Another large-effect QTL qLRS1.37 was identified close to the sd1 locus on chromosome 1. A grain yield QTL qGY1.42 located on chromosome 1 contained only 4 candidate genes. There was no overlapping of QTLs for the root traits and the yield attributes. The important candidate genes present within the large effect QTL regions are MYB transcription factors, no apical meristem protein (NAC), potassium channel protein, nuclear matrix protein1, and chlorophyll A-B binding protein. The large effect QTLs (qDTF3.01, qPH1.38, and qLRS1.37) and a novel grain yield QTL qGYS1.42 can be used to incorporate in elite breeding lines to develop drought-tolerant rice varieties.

AB The transcription factor NF-kappa B is a key regulator of cellular processes. A mechanism that contributes to timely termination of NF-kappa B activity is UPS-dependent degradation of p65 in the nucleus or on chromatin. The ubiquitin-specific protease that takes part in this process and its molecular mechanisms are shown in previous study, but which structural feature of USP48 was responsible for these effects is unknown. Here, we show that maybe the stability of NF-kappa B is controlled by proteasome-mediated degradation and ubiquitin-specific protease 48 (USP48), also known as synaptic ubiquitin-specific protease (synUSP) or USP31, can enhance NF-kappa B stability through proteasome-dependent regulation in the nucleus. USP48 contains a carboxyl-terminal nuclear localizing signal, (RHRK941)-R-938, which is responsible for its nuclear translocation. Our results demonstrate a more detailed mechanism for this member of the USP gene family in cellular processes.

AB Maturation of MIR196A2 as a gene regulator with a high potential for targeted cancer therapy can be modulated by the rs11614913 polymorphism. Several studies evaluating the association between this variant and pathogenesis of colorectal cancer (CRC) found significant results in various ethnic groups. This study aimed at investigating this relationship in a large sample size of Iranians as well as in a systematic review and meta-analysis of the pooled data of the current study with previous reports from Iran and other populations. After extraction of genomic DNA from the formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues and whole blood of 2150 subjects (42% CRC patients), the rs11614913 was genotyped in both cases and controls. Furthermore, we conducted a meta-analysis of the present case-control study together with a previous report from Iranian population. The results of case control study identified significant association between the rs11614913 and susceptibility to CRC [TT vs. CC: 1.58 (1.26-1.98), p < 0.01; TT vs. CT: 3.94 (3.07-5.05), p < 0.01; TT vs. CC + CT: 0.70 (0.59-0.83), p < 0.01; and CT + TT vs. CC: 1.43 (1.21-1.70), p < 0.01]. After correction of the meta-analysis results by using Bonferroni protocol, no significant association was observed in overall and in Asians [T vs. C: 1.19 (1.00-1.43), p = 0.05 and 1.14 (0.83-1.56), p = 0.43, respectively], whereas association was significant in Caucasians [T vs. C: 1.14 (1.04-1.25), p = 0.004] influenced by the data from Iran [T vs. C: 1.15 (1.03-1.29), p = 0.02 and [T vs. CC + CT: 0.73 (0.60-0.87), p = 0.003]. In conclusion, MIR196A2 rs11614913 might play a potential role in the pathogenesis of CRC in Iranian population.

AB Background: Human mutagenesis has a large stochastic component. Thus, large coding regions, especially cytoskeletal and extra-cellular matrix protein (CECMP) coding regions are particularly vulnerable to mutations. Recent results have verified a high level of somatic mutations in the CECMP coding regions in the cancer genome atlas (TCGA), and a relatively common occurrence of germline, deleterious mutations in the TCGA breast cancer dataset.
   Methods: The objective of this study was to determine the correlations of CECMP coding region, germline nucleotide variations with both overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). TCGA, tumor and blood variant calling files (VCFs) were intersected to identify germline SNVs. SNVs were then annotated to determine potential consequences for amino acid (AA) residue biochemistry.
   Results: Germline SNVs were matched against somatic tumor SNVs (i.e., tumor mutations) over twenty TCGA datasets to identify 23 germline-somatic matched, deleterious AA substitutions in coding regions for FLG, TTN, MUC4, and MUC17.
   Conclusions: The germline-somatic matched SNVs, in particular for MUC4, extensively implicated in cancer development, represented highly, statistically significant effects on OS and DFS survival rates. The above results contribute to the establishment of what is potentially a new class of inherited cancer-facilitating genes, namely dominant negative tumor suppressor proteins.

AB Purpose: Increasing evidence demonstrates that the four and a half LIM domain (FHL) gene and its protein products have different functions in the progression of various malignancies. However, the role of FHL protein 2 (FHL2) in cervical cancer (CC) has not been fully elucidated. In this study, we investigated the prognostic value of FHL2 expression in human CC tissues and the potential molecular mechanisms through which FHL2 modulates CC cell proliferation and apoptosis.
   Materials and methods: We measured FHL2 expression in CC cell lines and tissues by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot assays. The effects of FHL2 knockdown on cell proliferation and apoptosis in two CC cell lines were examined using RNA interference, cell counting kit-8, Western blot and flow cytometry assays. Furthermore, we assessed phosphorylated protein kinase B (p-AKT) and phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin (p-mTOR) expression in two CC cell lines to determine whether the AKT/mTOR pathway is involved in the effects of FHL2 silencing on cell proliferation and apoptosis. Nude mice tumorigenicity experiments were also performed to evaluate the effects of FHL2 on HeLa cell growth in vivo.
   Results: We found that FHL2 was significantly upregulated in CC cell lines and tissues. According to survival curves, high FHL2 expression levels in patients were correlated with poor prognosis. Moreover, by decreasing p-AKT and p-mTOR protein levels, silencing FHL2 significantly inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis. FHL2 knockdown also induced apoptosis by increasing the Bax-to-Bcl2 ratio. By contrast, FHL2 overexpression significantly promoted cell proliferation. Finally, decreased tumour growth in an in vivo animal model also demonstrated the tumour-suppressing effects of FHL2 knockdown.
   Conclusion: Our findings indicate that FHL2 is an important prognostic factor in CC and that it plays a crucial oncoprotein role by promoting cell proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis in CC, possibly by targeting the AKT/mTOR pathway.

AB Bioactive peptides derived from food matrices are currently a subject of intensive research, due to the multiple health benefits they can exert in the human body. However, the small size and low abundance of these peptides in complex matrices as well as the effect of food processing and gastrointestinal digestion on their structure, sequence, and functionality, are important challenges. Spanish dry-cured ham has been reported as a good and natural source of bioactive peptides mainly showing antihypertensive and antioxidant activities. In this work, the antioxidant peptide AEEEYPDL, identified from 9 months of curing dry-cured ham, showed good resistance to different heat treatments and salt contents. The bioactivity of the peptide significantly decreased after simulated gastrointestinal digestion. An optimised multiple reaction monitoring methodology was able to quantify the peptide AEEEYPDL at a concentration of 0.148 fg per g of dry-cured ham, despite the existing challenges in the quantification of bioactive peptides from complex matrices.

AB This study revealed the compositional characteristics of sunki, a traditional, unsalted, lactic acid-fermented pickle produced using turnip leaf in Kiso district, Japan. Comprehensive compositional analysis by two metabolomic approaches based on NMR and solid-phase microextraction-GC/MS methods was used to determine its chemical composition by annotating 54 water-soluble and 62 volatile compounds. Principal component analysis showed that samples had different compositions, depending on the agricultural processing factory and production year. This variation potentially resulted from the differences in the lactic acid bacterial community produced during the spontaneous fermentation of sunki and in the initial nutritional composition of the turnip leaf. Partial least squares regression revealed that the acetic acid level showed a strong positive correlation with pH (R = 0.810), in contrast to the negative correlations of lactic acid and ethanol levels (R = -0.533 and -0.547). This indicated the crucial impact of acetic acid-related metabolism on acidification during sunki fermentation.

AB An innovative use of thermal infrared enthalpimetry (TIE) is proposed for the determination of alcoholic content of red and white wines. Notwithstanding the presence of ethanol in beverages, absolute ethanol was added directly to wines, and the temperature rise caused by the heat of dilution was monitored using an infrared camera. Analytical signals were obtained in only 10 s for four samples simultaneously, and a calibration curve was constructed with hydroalcoholic reference solutions. A linear calibration curve was obtained from 3.0 to 18.0% (v/v) ethanol (R-2 = 0.9987). The results showed agreement ranging from 98.2 to 104.0% with 942.06 and 969.12 methods of AOAC. Organic compounds (e.g., sugar) did not interfere in the determinations. The proposed method provided fast results, with a throughput of 480 samples per hour and negligible energy consumption (0.001 kWh). In addition, the consumption of reagents was reduced when compared with conventional method fulfilling green analytical chemistry requirements.

AB Ulva is increasingly viewed as a food source in the world. Here, Ulva rigida was cultured at two levels of temperature (14, 18 degrees C), pH (7.95, 7.55, corresponding to low and high pCO(2)), and nitrate conditions (6 mu mol L-1, 150 mu mol L-1), to investigate the effects of ocean warming, acidification, and eutrophication on food quality of Ulva species. High temperature increased the content of each amino acid. High nitrate increased the content of all amino acids except aspartic acid and cysteine. High temperature, pCO(2), and nitrate also increased the content of most fatty acids. The combination of high temperature, pCO(2), and nitrate increased the swelling capacity, water holding capacity, and oil holding capacity by 15.60%, 7.88%, and 16.32% respectively, compared to the control. It seems that the future ocean environment would enhance the production of amino acid and fatty acid as well as the functional properties of Ulva species.

AB Our previous study reported the improved stability of fucoxanthin (FX) fortified in whole milk (WM) and skimmed milk (SM). In this study, in vivo and in vitro FX bioavailability were investigated using FX-fortified milk (FX-SM and FX-WM) and microalga Phaeodactylum tricornutum biomass (Pt-powder). Organ tissue accumulation of FX and its metabolites (FXOH: fucoxanthinol, AXA: amarouciaxanthin A) after repeated oral administration was in the following order: FX-SM > FX-WM > Pt-powder. In vivo pharmacokinetic study with a single oral administration also demonstrated that the absorption of FXOH and AXA was the highest for FX-SM. To reinforce the in vivo results, in vitro-simulated digestion and Caco-2 cell uptake assays were performed, which revealed that FX-SM showed the highest FX bioaccessibility (release from food matrices) and cellular uptake efficiency of FX and FXOH. In conclusion, skimmed milk was validated as an excellent food matrix for FX application in terms of stability and bioavailability.

AB The effects of an enzyme-assisted fermentation technique on the water holding capacity (WHC) and drying characteristics of potato pulp were investigated. Potato pulp was fermented with Lactobacillus plantarum to increase the content of organic acids, reduce the pH of the pulp and assist in enhancing the enzymatic hydrolysis. Removal of pectin and cellulose reduced the WHC of potato pulp from 16.84 to 6.83 and 9.64 g/g, respectively. Drying characteristics were determined using the air-drying process, which indicated that pectinase-assisted fermentation could remove pectin from potato pulp and shorten the air-drying time from 240 to 140 min, while cellulase had an opposite effect on the drying rate. This result was also confirmed by low field nuclear magnetic resonance (LF-NMR), which showed more mobile water and less bonded water in pectin-removed potato pulp samples.

AB A p-coumaroyl esterase from Rhizoctonia solani was used to decrease 5-O-chlorogenic acid (5-CQA) content in coffee powder. HPLC-UV showed a decline of up to 98% of 5-CQA after the enzyme treatment. Effects on aroma were determined by means of aroma extract dilution analysis. Flavour dilution factors of treated and control extract differed in four volatile compounds only. Effect on aroma and taste was evaluated by sensory tests. No significant differences were perceived, and no off-flavour nor off-taste was noted. As chlorogenic acids are suspected to cause stomach irritating effects in sensitive people, the enzyme treatment offers a technically feasible approach to improve the quality of coffee beverages by reducing 5-CQA concentration without significantly affecting the aroma and taste profile.

AB This study investigates the enrichment of aptamers targeting the norovirus protruding domain in the presence of foods often associated with norovirus outbreaks. The goal is to explore if and how the presence of food alters in vitro selection of aptamers and target binding of the enriched oligonucleotides. Our study demonstrates that the introduction of food to SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) is either detrimental to enrichment of oligonucleotides with target-specific binding, or facilitates enrichment of non-target-specific oligonucleotides. Moreover, a relationship between target binding of enriched oligonucleotides in presence of food and their selection condition was not observed. Our findings also suggest that a pathogen specific aptamer with application in food does not need to be selected in presence of the particular food, but may require properties beyond high affinity and selectivity to be applied for pathogen extraction and detection in undiluted food matrices.

AB The effects of tea polyphenols on binding of porcine pancreatic a-amylase (PPA) with normal maize starch granules were studied through solution depletion assays, fluorescence spectroscopy and initial rate kinetics. Only polyphenols which have inhibitory activity against PPA increased the binding of PPA with starch. The results are consistent with a binding equilibrium between polyphenols, starch and PPA. The dissociation constant (K-d) for PPA binding was decreased by tea polyphenols, with the effects greater for theaflavins than catechins and for galloylated than non-galloylated polyphenols. Tea polyphenols were also shown to increase the binding rate of PPA to starch. In addition, there were positive linear correlations between 1/K-d and reciprocal of competitive inhibition constant (1/K-ic) and between 1/K-d and fluorescence quenching constant (K-FQ). Despite the greater amount of PPA on the granules, starch hydrolysis is reduced because the polyphenol inhibition of PPA persists after binding to starch.

AB Small collagen peptides are associated with various benefits, such as bone and skin health. However, preparation of small collagen peptides from terrestrial vertebrate origins remains a challenge. Here, we show that pretreatment with formic acid enhanced the production of small collagen peptides from spent hen skin. After pretreatment with formic acid, the percentage of small peptides below 2 kDa increased to 48.92% and 43.34% from 33.79% and 36.32% for heat-soluble collagen (HSC) and pepsin- soluble collagen (PSC), respectively. Pretreatment with formic acid degraded telopeptides and released the cross-links (pyrrole and pyridinoline), which made hen collagen more susceptible to papain hydrolysis. LC-MS/MS results revealed that none of the peptides identified from HSC-FA (formic acid)-Papain and PSC-FA-Papain were derived from cross-linked telopeptides. These results demonstrated that formic acid assisted the hydrolysis of highly cross-linked collagen of spent hens, and it might also be used to produce small collagen peptides from other aged, vertebrate collagens.

AB The present study reports an ultra high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method for the simultaneous determination of six bisphenols (bisphenol A, bisphenol B and bisphenol F) and alkylphenols (4-nonylphenol,4-n-nonylphenol and octylphenol) in hotpot seasoning. Samples were dispersed in nhexane after addition of internal standards bisphenol A-d(4) and 4-n-nonylphenol-d(4). Sample solutions were then centrifuged, and the supernatants purified using solid phase extraction with high polarity Carb/PSA composite fillers. Six target analytes were separated on a Waters ACQUITY BEH C18 column by gradient elution with methanol and 0.05% ammonium hydroxide in water as the mobile phase, and determined under multiple reactions monitoring mode. The limits of detection and quantitation, matrix effect, recovery and precision of the method were investigated. Results were linear in the concentration range 0.1-250 mu g/L for all compounds of interest, with R-2 > 0.9950. Limits of detection were in the range 0.1-0.4 mu g/kg, and limits of quantitation were between 0.5 mu g/kg and 1.0 mu g/kg. The mean recoveries for negative samples at three spiked concentrations were in the range 87.9%-102.4%, and the intra-day precision and inter-day precision were in the ranges 2.1-8.2% and 4.8-11.2%, respectively. This method is accurate and sensitive, and had good clean-up characteristics, which might apply to screening and quantitation of target bisphenols and alkylphenols in hotpot seasoning.

AB High performance liquid chromatography, coupled with a benchtop Q-Exactive Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometer, was successfully applied for the determination of 24 target antibiotics (selected beta-lactams, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, sulfonamids, phenicols, macrolides, cephalosporins, lincosamides, diaminopyrimidine) in fish matrices. The Q-Exactive parameters were carefully studied to accomplish the best compromise between a suitable scan speed and selectivity, considering the restrictions associated with generic sample preparation methodology. Retention time, an exact mass with tolerance of 2 ppm and data-dependent MS2 spectra were the main identifiers. The method was validated through specificity, linearity, recovery, intra and inter-day repeatability, decision limit (CC alpha) and detection capability (CC beta), according to 2002/657/EC. The values of CC alpha and CC beta ranged from 29.2 to 36.8 and 32.5 to 48.9, respectively, while overall recovery ranged from 91.1 to 105.6%. Fifty fish samples were analysed, showing the sporadic incidence of enrofloxacin, chlortetracycline, oxytetracycline, amoxicillin and trimethoprim, albeit below the maximum residual levels.

AB Glycans in human milk serve several important biological functions that promote infant health. As kind of important glycans, glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are a complex family of polyanionic carbohydrate, participating in a variety of critical physiological and pathological processes. In this study, the content and the detailed composition of human milk GAGs from Chinese mothers in different stages of lactation, based on a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry approach was investigated. The results showed that the GAG fraction in the human milk samples was very complex as it was composed of heparan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate, and hyaluronic acid. With lactation extending, the total amount of GAGs in human milk decreased. This study provided an important guide for the demands of GAGs during different stages of lactation. The results were also beneficial for studies on the composition and functional properties of infant formula.

AB A study was carried out to determine and compare the key aroma compounds in raw and dry porcini mushroom (Boletus edulis). The volatile fractions were prepared by solvent-assisted flavor evaporation (SAFE), and aroma extract dilution analysis (AEDA) combined with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was employed to identify the odorants. Selected aroma compounds were quantitated and odor activity values (OAVs) were calculated revealing OAVs >= 1 for 12 compounds in raw porcini, among which 1-octen-3-one showed the highest OAV. In addition to compounds with eight carbon atoms, 3-methylbutanal, (E, E)-2,4-decadienal and (E, E)-2,4-nonadienal were also responsible for the unique aroma profile. In dry mushroom OAVs >= 1 were obtained for 20 odorants. Among them, 3-(methylthio) propanal, 1-octen-3-one and pyrazines were determined as predominant odorants. Overall, drying increased complexity of volatile compounds, thus significantly changing the aroma profile of porcini, providing more desirable roasted and seasoning-like flavor and less grasslike and earthy notes.

AB Water insolubility is one of the major bottlenecks restricting the commercial availability of such food proteins as rice proteins (RPs), zein, etc. Here, we report that the structural hybridization of RPs and casein in a mass ratio of 1:0.01 can boost the solubility of RPs to over 90%. A structural analysis demonstrated that the backbones of the RPs and casein were integrated in basic solution (pH 12.0) and folded together into higher structures with subsequent neutralization. The hybrid backbones obtained improved the molecules' resistance to structural changes during neutralization, and formed protein bodies with appreciable exposed polar groups, which may have been buried in the absence of casein. Morphological observations confirmed the formation of well-defined nanoscale particles with no visible aggregation. Both proteins also retained their intact primary peptide chains, thus significantly protecting the original nature of the plant and animal derivatives.

AB The difference in Raman spectra for different excitation wavelengths (532 nm, 785 nm, and 1064 nm) was investigated to identify an appropriate wavelength for the quantitative analysis of carotenoids in tomatoes. For the 532 nm-excited Raman spectra, the intensity of the peak assigned to the carotenoid has no correlation with carotenoid concentration, and the peak shift reflects carotenoid composition changing from lycopene to beta-carotene and lutein. Thus, 532 nm-excited Raman spectra are useful for the qualitative analysis of carotenoids. For the 785 nm-and 1064 nm-excited Raman spectra, the peak intensity of the carotenoid showed good correlation with carotenoid concentration; thus, regression models for carotenoid concentration were developed using these Raman spectra and partial least squares regression. A regression model designed using the 785 nm-excited Raman spectra showed a better result than the 532 nm-and 1064 nm-excited Raman spectra. Therefore, it can be concluded that 785 nm is the most suitable excitation wavelength for the quantitative analysis of carotenoid concentration in tomatoes.

AB Tartary buckwheat achenes are rich in rutin. However, its utilisation as a food is low due to the bitter taste of the products because of the transformation of rutin to quercetin. The aim of this study was to determine the stability of rutin and selected flavonoids, which are influenced by the different sample preparations exposing the achenes to higher temperatures (60 degrees C, 100 degrees C, and 140 degrees C), and also to determine the specificity of the rutin degrading enzymes in Tartary buckwheat. The achenes were directly extracted with methanol pre-extracted with hexane, or lyophilised before extraction. The rutin and quercetin contents were determined by HPLC. The rutin-degrading enzymes in Tartary buckwheat achenes were not inactivated after a heat treatment up to 140 degrees C acting on them for three hours; neither to lyophilisation nor pre-extraction with hexane. The rutin-degrading enzymes probably caused the deglycosylation of kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside, kaempferol-3-O-beta-D-glucoside and piceid. Rutin-degrading enzymes were inactivated with 100% methanol.

AB Milk is often polluted by heavy metal ions due to the growing environment pollution, but few methods have been developed to remove the heavy metal ions. Here a non-toxic sorbent, namely di-acrylated Pluronic P123 (P123-DA) hydrogel, was fabricated for removal of Hg2+ and Pb2+ from milk without impairing their nutritive contents. This hydrogel possessed high mechanical stress and maximum adsorption capacity of 35.2 and 53.9 mg/g for Pb2+ and Hg2+. The removal ratio of Pb2+ and Hg2+ by P123-DA hydrogel respectively reached 85.3% and 81.9% for the polluted whole milk while was individually 86.3% and 83.8% for the skim milk. Interestingly, the treatment by P123-DA hydrogel didn't significantly reduce the main nutritive contents in milk. Such hydrogel will be a recyclable, safe and effective tool for reuse of milk that polluted by heavy metal ions.

AB Lactulose is not found naturally in milk, but it has been detected in small quantities in heated dairy products. It can therefore be used as an indicator of the severity of heat treatment for dairy products. This study proposes an alternative method for lactulose quantification in milk using capillary zone electrophoresis with ultraviolet detection (CZE-UV). The investigation used several Brazilian UHT milk samples, and various sample pretreatment methods and injection conditions were considered. Optimal separation results were achieved using Carrez clarification solutions. Low detection and quantification limits were obtained, and good precision and high recovery rates indicated the applicability of the method for analysis of milk. Due to matrix effects, single-point standard addition was used for lactulose quantification. High lactulose concentrations (> 1000 mg L-1) suggested that recirculation may have occurred during milk processing. The findings demonstrate that the CZE-UV method is a viable alternative for quality process control.

AB There remain gaps in our understanding of the fate of liposomes in the infant gastrointestinal tract, especially regarding essential proteins such as lactoferrin. Models in vitro that mirrored digestion in the stomach and intestine of infants and adults were used to explore the behaviour of lactoferrin-loaded liposomes. The liposomes behaved differently in these environments, with less hydrolysis of encapsulated lactoferrin under infant model conditions. Compared to the adult model (1000 +/- 66 mu MmL(-1)), fewer free fatty acids were released (500 +/- 43 mu MmL(-1)) from liposomal bilayers and there was less alteration in functional groups of phospholipids membranes, based on pH and FTIR after infant model digestion. Particle tracking analysis and TEM supported the reduced damage of particle structure under infant model conditions. This work provides information on the stability of functional protein-loaded liposomes during digestion, and shows the potential of liposomes to be nutrient carriers in infant foods.

AB Sr-87/Sr-86 was determined on fresh red and white grapes, soils and rocks from three selected vineyards to verify the isotopic relationships between the fruit of the vine and geologic substrata of vineyards. Sr-87/Sr-86 were determined on sampled grapes of four different harvest years and different grape varieties, on bioavailable fraction of soils, on whole soils, and on bedrocks from the geo-pedological substratum of the vineyards. The vineyards chosen for the experimental works belong to an organic farming winery and thus cultivation procedures were strictly controlled.
   Grapes were sampled during the harvests of four different but consecutive years with Sr-87/Sr-86 that does not change reflecting the values of the soil bioavailable fraction. No variations among grapes from different vine cultivars were observed. A strict isotope relationship with soil bio-available fraction was observed. These findings demonstrate the reliability of Sr-87/Sr-86, even at a very small scale, for food products geographic origin assessment.

AB The ever-increasing demand for fish as a food, has led to the development of new handling and packaging technologies resulting in premium quality fish products. In order to avoid frauds reaching the market, fish quality assurance methods need to be developed.
   In this study, two statistical models of biochemical processes that occur in Atlantic salmon during two weeks of storage at 0 and 4 degrees C were developed. These models were further used to detect salmon quality and its storage conditions. The biochemical processes were monitored using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and principal component analysis (PCA). The Soft Independent Modeling of Class Analogy (SIMCA) approach was applied to develop and evaluate the models. The fraud detection potential of the models was tested using samples of various quality and storage parameters. It was shown that the developed models are able to discriminate quality, time and temperature of stored Atlantic salmon.

AB Structure-activity relationships between 20 sterols and their thermal stabilities were studied in a model oil system. All sterol degradations were found to be consistent with a first-order kinetic model with determination of coefficient (R-2) higher than 0.9444. The number of double bonds in the sterol structure was negatively correlated with the thermal stability of sterol, whereas the length of the branch chain was positively correlated with the thermal stability of sterol. A quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model to predict thermal stability of sterol was developed by using partial least squares regression (PLSR) combined with genetic algorithm (GA). A regression model was built with R-2 of 0.806. Almost all sterol degradation constants can be predicted accurately with R-2 of cross-validation equals to 0.680. Four important variables were selected in optimal QSAR model and the selected variables were observed to be related with information indices, RDF descriptors, and 3D-MoRSE descriptors.

AB Infection transmission is a complex and dynamic process, and is therefore difficult to assess. Consequently, mathematical models are a useful tool to understand any leverage on this transmission, such as vaccination. Models can provide guidance to implement an optimal vaccination campaign whether it concerns the fraction of the population or the age-group to be vaccinated. Mathematical models can also provide insights on counter-intuitive collateral effects of vaccination campaign, given the possibility that the overall benefits for the general population may hide deleterious effects on some sub-groups.
   As a large proportion of the population is now vaccinated, complex modelling taking into account individual and population heterogeneity and behaviour is necessary although challenging. But the most crucial aspect in the future of mathematical modelling still consists in obtaining precise and exhaustive data. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Adult immunization coverage rates remain low in the United States and internationally, despite obvious benefits to vaccinating and maintaining a well-vaccinated adult population. Broad policy changes are required to identify and address gaps in financing, in immunization infrastructure, and patient and provider awareness and knowledge to improve the protection of our adult and aging population from vaccine-preventable diseases. There is good evidence that efforts are now underway both within the United States and across the world to advance these policy changes. There are successful interventions that have been demonstrated to improve rates in the pediatric population that must be translated into the adult patient population to meet the critical gaps that remain at the interface of the delivery of vaccinations to adults. Improvements in overall policy will only increase adult immunization coverage rates if interventions are adapted and implemented for adult patients. Often, these same interventions will be applicable to adolescent patients as well. These interventions have been reviewed by the United States Preventive Services Task Force and recommended interventions fall into three categories: (1) Enhancing Patient Access to Vaccination; (2) Improving community/patient demand; and (3) Provider and healthcare system-directed interventions. Specific interventions that have been demonstrated successful for the adult population include interventions such as reducing patient out-of-pocket costs for vaccinations, patient or family incentive rewards, and implementation of quality measures and quality improvement interventions. Addressing the poor performance in adult immunizations requires approaches predicated on not repeating previous efforts and will require innovative thinking to integrate multiple interventions that have been successful separately, into a holistic approach to support and automate immunization assessment, recommendation, and administration. This can then lead to increased valuation of adult and adolescent immunizations within the priorities of a healthcare system, and improvements in clinic efficiency within a practice.

AB We have just witnessed the largest and most devastating outbreak of Ebola virus disease, which highlighted the urgent need for development of an efficacious vaccine that could be used to curtail future outbreaks. Prior to 2014, there had been limited impetus worldwide to develop a vaccine since the virus was first discovered in 1976. Though too many lives were lost during this outbreak, it resulted in the significantly accelerated clinical development of a number of candidate vaccines through an extraordinary collaborative global effort coordinated by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and involving a number of companies, trial centres, funders, global stakeholders and agencies. We have acquired substantial safety and immunogenicity data on a number of vaccines in Caucasian and African populations. The rapid pace of events led to the initiation of the landmark efficacy trial testing the rVSV-vectored vaccine, which showed high level efficacy in an outbreak setting when deployed using an innovative ring vaccination strategy. Though the Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) declared by the WHO has now been lifted, the global scientific community faces numerous challenges ahead to ensure that there is a licensed, deployable vaccine available for use in future outbreaks for at least the Zaire and Sudan strains of Ebola virus. There remain several unanswered questions on the durability of protection, mechanistic immunological correlates and preferred deployment strategies. This review outlines a brief history of the development of Ebola vaccines, the significant progress made since the scale of the outbreak became apparent, some lessons learnt and how they could shape future development of vaccines and the management of similar outbreaks.

AB Introduction: Widespread introduction of pneumococcal conjugated vaccines (PCVs) impacted on invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). However, IPD reduction may not be similar in all outcomes within IPD. We assessed PCV7/PCV13 impact on pneumococcal meningitis, bacteremic pneumonia (BP) and other (non-meningitis, non-pneumonia) IPD episodes in children <5 years in Israel.
   Methods: A prospective, population-based, active nationwide surveillance.
   All pneumococcal invasive episodes with positive blood/CSF cultures, July 2000 through June 2016, were included. Three sub-periods were defined: pre-PCV (2000-2008), PCV7 (2009-2011) and PCV13 (2014-2016). Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were calculated.
   Results: Overall, 4321 episodes were recorded; 456 (10.6%) meningitis, 1478 (34.2%) pneumonia and 2387 (55.2%) other-IPD.
   In the pre-PCV period, proportion of serotypes in PCV13, but not in PCV7 (mainly serotypes 1, 5 and 19A) was higher in BP (43.3%) compared with other-IPD episodes (32.8%, p < 0.001) and similar to that of meningitis (37.6%, p = 0.1). The proportion of episodes in children <12 months was higher in meningitis (52.1%) compared with pneumonia (23.2%) and other-IPD episodes (39.5%; p < 0.001 for both).
   The declines of the 3 entities were not similar; Meningitis rate non-significantly declined by 24% (IRR = 0.76; 95% CI 0.57-1.01), while BP and other-IPD rates significantly declined by 57% and 70%, respectively. In contrast to other entities, BP did not decline significantly after PCV7 introduction but started to decline only after PCV13 introduction.
   Rates of meningitis, pneumonia and other-IPD caused by PCV13-serotypes (VT13) substantially declined by 88%, 95% and 97%, respectively, comparing PCV13 and the pre-PCV periods. However, diseases caused by non-VT13 increased by 256%, 302% in meningitis and pneumonia, respectively, but only 116% in other-IPD.
   Conclusions: Following PCV7/PCV13 introduction, rates of episodes caused by VT13 were substantially reduced in all 3 groups. However, differences in age distribution, serotype replacement and specific serotype decrease suggest different pathogenesis and host susceptibility between the 3 entities. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB At the current time, the field of vaccinology remains empirical in many respects. Vaccine development, vaccine immunogenicity, and vaccine efficacy have, for the most part, historically been driven by an empiric "isolate-inactivate-inject" paradigm. In turn, a population-level public health paradigm of "the same dose for everyone for every disease" model has been the normative thinking in regard to prevention of vaccine-preventable infectious diseases. In addition, up until recently, no vaccines had been designed specifically to overcome the immunosenescence of aging, consistent with a post-WWII mentality of developing vaccines and vaccine programs for children. It is now recognized that the current lack of knowledge concerning how immune responses to vaccines are generated is a critical barrier to understanding poor vaccine responses in the elderly and in immunoimmaturity, discovery of new correlates of vaccine immunogenicity (vaccine response biomarkers), and a directed approach to new vaccine development.
   The new fields of vaccinomics and adversomics provide models that permit global profiling of the innate, humoral, and cellular immune responses integrated at a systems biology level. This has advanced the science beyond that of reductionist scientific approaches by revealing novel interactions between and within the immune system and other biological systems (beyond transcriptional level), which are critical to developing "downstream" adaptive humoral and cellular responses to infectious pathogens and vaccines. Others have applied systems level approaches to the study of antibody responses (a.k.a. "systems serology"), [1] high-dimensional cell subset immunophenotyping through CyTOF, [2,3] and vaccine induced metabolic changes [4]. In turn, this knowledge is being utilized to better understand the following: identifying who is at risk for which infections; the level of risk that exists regarding poor immunogenicity and/or serious adverse events; and the type or dose of vaccine needed to fully protect an individual. In toto, such approaches allow for a personalized approach to the practice of vaccinology, analogous to the substantial inroads that individualized medicine is playing in other fields of human health and medicine. Herein we briefly review the field of vaccinomics, adversomics, and personalized vaccinology. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Adult immunization is a priority for public health, particularly in countries where an aging population has become increasingly more numerous. Protection against diseases which typically affect adults (like flu, pneumococcal diseases and Herpes zoster), the shift of age of infections which originally affected children (like measles), the decreasing protection with time for infections which need periodical booster doses of vaccines (Tdap), the availability of vaccines which can also impact on adult health (HPV) are only some examples of the importance of implementing targeted vaccination strategies.
   The possibility to reach high coverage with immunizations that can guarantee a fundamental improvement of health for adults and the elderly can only be achieved through a coordinated effort where all stakeholders, under the coordination of public health, contribute to issue recommendations; create a functioning database for vaccine coverage registration; promote formative courses for healthcare workers and continuous information for the public; increase vaccines uptake among healthcare workers, who need to give the first testimony on the relevance of immunization.

AB Vaccination during pregnancy is increasingly being recognised internationally a useful means of preventing illness in pregnant women and their newborns. It has been used since the 1960s, when it was found that tetanus vaccine was highly effective in preventing neonatal tetanus, but interest has greatly increased over the last few years. As new data become available showing the numerous benefits of maternal immunisation and its potential for improving maternal and neonatal health in relation to a number of infectious conditions, it is being increasingly incorporated into the national vaccination programmes around the world. However, the development of new vaccines, the existence of clinical trials testing the efficacy of vaccinating pregnant women in order to protect newborns against respiratory syncytial virus and group B Streptococcus infections, and the fact that the uptake of influenza and pertussis vaccines during pregnancy is lower than expected in developed countries is making it increasingly clear that existing maternal vaccination programmes need to be strengthened. This reviews addresses the importance of integrating maternal immunisation and standard obstetrical care in order to promote vaccination administration by maternal care providers (MCPs) because the vaccination goals for pregnant women cannot be achieved without appropriate training and extending the role of MCPs as vaccinators. In order to make meaningful progress, it is necessary to develop and refine targeted messages for pregnant women concerning the benefits of maternal immunisation for themselves and their infants.

AB The challenge of assimilating millions of immigrants in the European region each year presents significant socioeconomic issues. Among them is the threat of vaccine preventable diseases (VPDs) disease transmission within immigrant groups and the broader population given the permeability of nation state borders. A total of 3.8 million people immigrated to the European Union (EU) in 2014, among those were 1.6 million non-EU nationals. While vaccines have markedly reduced the transmission of disease, clusters of under-vaccinated individuals potentiate the rapid transmission of once-eradicated or controlled diseases. Immigrants pose a special challenge to host country public health vaccination programmes. Wars in their native countries may have interrupted vaccination programmes, documentation may be unavailable or unreliable, and refugees may present with health issues due to poor sanitation and food during transit. Further, immigrants are often reticent to access health care in the destination country, or may face financial or language barriers. Thus, preventive health care needs may go unaddressed and the first contact with a clinician is for an emergency. Equitable access to acute and preventive health care and services, including immunizations irrespective of individual's immigration status, should be a priority for European region countries. Ensuring appropriate and timely vaccination for immigrants could be accomplished with a universal European region immunization schedule. Priority should be given to highly communicable VPDs such as measles, mumps, rubella, pertussis, diphtheria, varicella and polio. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

   INFLUENZA; MATERNAL IMMUNIZATION; PREGNANT-WOMEN; ECONOMIC-IMPACT
AB At the beginning of this century, a number of studies suggested that in healthy children, particularly those <2 years of age, influenza could have a serious and complicated course, as it frequently led to hospitalization and sometimes, albeit rarely, to death. Moreover, pre-schoolers and school-age children were found to be among the most important causes of influenza transmission to the community, as they shed the virus for a longer time than adults and had frequent contact with greater numbers of individuals through day-care and school. These findings led a number of health authorities to modify the official recommendations regarding the use of influenza vaccine in healthy children. Several factors seem to indicate that vaccination against influenza in healthy children of any age and in pregnant women could be effective in preventing the disease in the entire paediatric population and in providing herd immunity in adults and old people as well. The direct advantages of the vaccine seem greater in younger subjects, particularly those <2-3 years of age. Vaccination of older children is considered effective by most experts, but high vaccination coverage of these subjects has been difficult to attain. Similar difficulties have been identified for the vaccination of pregnant women. These challenges can be overcome, at least in part, by appropriate information and accurate evaluations of available data. In addition, further studies specifically designed to clarify unresolved problems regarding vaccine use in paediatric and pregnant populations are needed to convince reluctant health authorities. More effective vaccines for younger children as well as improved availability of data regarding the optimal time period for vaccine administration in pregnant women appear relevant in this regard.

AB Introduction: In 2013, the annual influenza immunisation programme in England was extended to children to reduce the burden of influenza, but uptake was sub-optimal at 53.2%.
   Aim: To explore the reasons some parents decided not to vaccinate their child against influenza as part of the pilot programme offered in schools.
   Methods: Cross-sectional qualitative study conducted between February and July 2015. 913 parents whose children were not vaccinated against influenza in the school pilots in West Yorkshire and Greater Manchester, England, were asked to comment on their reasons for non-vaccination and invited to take part in a semi-structured interview. 138 parents returned response forms, of which 38 were eligible and interested in participating and 25 were interviewed. Interview transcripts were coded by theme in NVivo.
   Results: A third of parents who returned response forms had either vaccinated their child elsewhere, intended to have them vaccinated, or had not vaccinated them due to medical reasons (valid or perceived). Most interviewees were not convinced of the need to vaccinate their child against influenza. Parents expressed concerns about influenza vaccine effectiveness and vaccine side effects. Several parents interviewed declined the vaccine for faith reasons due to the presence of porcine gelatine in the vaccine.
   Conclusions: To significantly decrease the burden of influenza in England, influenza vaccination coverage in children needs to be >60%. Hence, it is important to understand the reasons why parents are not vaccinating their children, and to tailor the communication and immunisation programme accordingly. Our finding that a third of parents, who did not consent to their child being vaccinated as part of the school programme, had actually vaccinated their child elsewhere, intended to have their child vaccinated, or had not vaccinated them due to medical reasons, illustrates the importance of including additional questions or data sources when investigating under-vaccination.

AB Measles, mumps, rubella and varicella are viral infections which can implicate seriously long-term sequelae of infected individuals or even the unborn child. Vaccines against the individual diseases have long been available. Global measles vaccination is estimated to have prevented more than 20 million deaths during 2000-2015. During the same time period, measles incidence decreased from 146 to 36 cases per million populations. Today vaccinations against measles, mumps, rubella and varicella are now carried out mainly with combination vaccines. These are today known as immunogenic and safe. MMRV had similar immunogenicity and overall safety profiles to MMR administered with or without varicella vaccine. This issue provides a review of the different vaccines, mode of administration, catch up immunization and postexposure prophylaxis as well as contraindications and adverse effects of the immunization against measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella. The article presents an overview of important information of preventing these diseases with a focus on the existing combination vaccines. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction: Despite availability of safe and cost-effective vaccines to prevent it, measles remains one of the significant causes of death among children under five years of age globally. The World Health Organization (WHO) European Region has seen a drastic decline in measles and rubella cases in recent years, and a few of the once common measles genotypes are no longer detected. Buoyed by this success, all Member States of the Region reconfirmed their commitment in 2010 to eliminating measles and rubella, and made this a central objective of the European Vaccine Action Plan 2015-2020 (EVAP). Nevertheless, sporadic outbreaks continue, recently affecting primarily adolescents and young adults with no vaccination or an incomplete vaccination history. The European Regional Verification Commission for Measles and Rubella Elimination was established in 2011 to evaluate the status of measles and rubella elimination based on documentation submitted annually by each country's national verification committee.
   Discussion: Each country's commitment to eliminate measles and rubella is influenced by competing health priorities, and in some cases lack of capacity and resources. All countries need to improve case base surveillance for both measles and rubella, ensure documentation of each outbreak and strengthen the link between epidemiology and laboratory data. Achieving high coverage with measles- and rubella-containing vaccines will require a multisectoral approach to address the root causes of lower uptake in identified communities including service delivery challenges or vaccine safety concerns caused by circulating myths about vaccination.
   Conclusions: The WHO European Region has made steady progress towards eliminating measles and rubella and over half of the countries interrupted endemic transmission of both diseases by 2015. The programmatic challenges in disease surveillance, vaccination service delivery and communication in the remaining endemic countries should be addressed through periodic evaluation of the strategies by all stakeholders and exploring additional opportunities to accelerate the ongoing elimination activities.

AB Prophylactic human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine represents a revolutionary step forward in preventing HPV-related cancers, especially cervical carcinoma. Alongside appropriate screening, it has the potential to dramatically reduce cervical cancer incidence and even eradicate it. Following extensive evaluations in clinical trials, the first decade of routine HPV vaccine use provides overwhelming evidence of the vaccines' safety and their real-life effectiveness. In 2016, further clinical trials showed high vaccine efficacy in adult women, especially those that were HPV DNA-negative at baseline, and indicated possible protection from HPV-related diseases after treatment of precancerous cervical lesions. The recommendation for a two-dose schedule in individuals under 15 is further supported for all three licensed vaccines by immunogenicity studies that show non-inferior immune responses and similar clinical efficacy compared to the three-dose schedule. So far, natural competition between HPV types has not been confirmed and therefore vaccine-induced clinically significant type replacement is unlikely. The real-world effectiveness data showed cross-sectional reduction in the prevalence/incidence of vaccine-related HPV types, genital warts and precancerous cervical lesions in countries and regions with HPV vaccination coverage. These declines were evident not only in vaccinated females, but also in unvaccinated females and males, strongly suggesting herd protection. Despite an excellent safety profile consistently demonstrated in clinical trials and confirmed in real-life settings, recently invented controversial syndromes allegedly linked to HPV vaccines temporarily compromised some previously very successful vaccination programs and significantly contributed to the failure of HPV vaccine implementation in some countries with the highest prevalence of cervical cancer. However, several safety studies failed to confirm any association of these syndromes with HPV vaccination in various settings and geographic locations. The main challenges remain implementing HPV vaccination in national vaccination programs, especially in low-and middle income countries with the highest burden of cervical cancer, and achieving and sustaining high vaccine coverage rates.

   IMPACT
AB Vaccines stimulate a person's immune system to produce an adequate reaction against a specific infectious agent; i.e. the person is protected from that disease without having to get it first. As vaccines are administrated to healthy subjects, they are held to the highest standards of safety. Regarding human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines, at present three prophylactic vaccines are licensed (bivalent HPV 16/18, quadrivalent HPV 6/11/16/18 and the nonovalent HPV 6/11/16/18/31/33/45/52/58 vaccine). Pre- and post-licensure studies (i.e. not yet for nonovalent HPV vaccine) confirm that HPV vaccines are generally safe and well-tolerated, site injections symptoms are the most common adverse events (AEs) reported, and pain is the most frequently referred local symptom. Serious AEs are rare and not associated with severe sequelae, at least no vaccine-related deaths have occurred. Despite these scientific evidences, it is still difficult to explain to the population the importance of a good vaccination programme. There are many determinants for HPV vaccines hesitancy which represent a barrier that must be overcome in order to increase vaccine coverage, including psychological reactions, religious or cultural aspects, and fear of possible AEs (demyelinating diseases, Complex Regional Pain Syndrome - CRPS, or Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome - POTS). A weak communication strategy which frequently suffers due to spread of unverified news by media and websites may lead to the failure of a vaccination programme. Such a situation happened in Japan (2013), due to which a great number of women remain vulnerable to HPV-related cancers. In order to resolve the issues around HPV vaccines acceptance, it is necessary to use good communication strategies. Multicomponent and dialogue-based interventions seem to be the most effective, especially if an adequate language is used, customized according to the vaccination programme target.

AB Rotavirus (RV) is the leading cause of severe acute gastroenteritis (GE) in infants worldwide. Several vaccines against RV were developed to reduce disease burden, hospitalization rates and health utilization costs. RV GE is a serious disease in preterm (PT) infants, and the administration of RV vaccine to these at-risk subjects at the proper time could have great clinical relevance. However, most data on the efficacy and safety of RV vaccinations were collected in healthy full-term infants, and few studies investigated PT infants. The lack of studies in PT infants may explain why neonatologists in several neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) do not follow the official recommendations, which indicate that RV vaccine may be administered in hospitals. Increasing neonatologists' knowledge on the efficacy and safety of RV vaccines and defining PT candidates for vaccination and the necessary precautions are extremely important to avoid potential vaccine virus transmission and improve RV vaccination coverage in PT infants. Further studies should analyse the impact of vaccination of PT infants of different gestational ages and various clinical histories in stable conditions in the NICU with a careful monitoring of adverse events to the vaccine and RV GE occurrence. Only data that confirm the efficacy and safety of RV vaccines in large numbers of PT infants with different characteristics will convince neonatologists to use RV vaccines in PT infants hospitalized in NICUs.

AB Noroviruses (NoVs) are one of the leading causes of acute gastroenteritis, including both outbreaks and endemic infections. The development of preventive strategies, including vaccines, for the most susceptible groups (children <5 years of age, the elderly and individuals suffering crowding, such as military personnel and travelers) is desirable. However, NoV vaccine development has faced many difficulties, including genetic/antigenic diversity, limited knowledge on NoV immunology and viral cycle, lack of a permissive cell line for cultivation and lack of a widely available and successful animal model. Vaccine candidates rely on inoculation of virus-like particles (VLPs) formed by the main capsid protein VP1, sub viral particles made from the protruding domain of VP1 (P-particles) or viral vectors with a NoV capsid gene insert produced by bioengineering technologies. Polivalent vaccines including multiple NoV genotypes and/or other viruses acquired by the enteric route have been developed. A VLP vaccine candidate has reached phase II clinical trials and several others are in pre-clinical stages of development. In this article we discuss the main challenges facing the development of a NoV vaccine and the current status of prevailing candidates. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The clinical relevance of herpes zoster (HZ) and its increased incidence in recent years has prompted a search for more effective measures of prevention and therapy. A number of vaccines has been developed. For two of them, the live attenuated HZ vaccine (LAHZV) and the adjuvanted recombinant subunit HZ vaccine (SUHZV), data regarding immunogenicity, efficacy, safety and reactogenicity have been collected. This information allows us to draw some conclusions about what can be expected from their use and what is still required to definitively solve the problem of HZ prevention. The currently licensed vaccine LAHZV is only partially satisfactory in terms of efficacy, but it is safe and exhibits acceptable reactogenicity. Because LAHZV is also highly cost effective, it should be used as widely as possible until new, more effective preparations are developed. In this regard, preliminary data regarding SUHZV are very promising, although more studies are needed before it can be licensed for routine use. Other vaccines, such as the inactivated VZV vaccine, are in development. It seems likely that in the near future, more effective HZ prevention for older adults can be achieved. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The world was never so close to reach the polio eradication: only 37 cases notified in 2016 in only three countries, but the game is not yet at the end. The risk of polio outbreaks in the EU is smaller than it has ever been in the past, but it is not so small that we can ignore it. The EU MS must remain alert and plan and prepare for managing polio events or outbreaks because of the possible dire consequences. The IPV only vaccination schedule universally applied in EU has achieved satisfactory coverage, but constantly leaving small accumulating pockets of susceptible individuals. Moreover the IPV only schedule is not an absolute barrier against poliovirus silent transmission as demonstrated in the recent Israel outbreak. The availability of annually revised S.O.P. from WHO GPEI on the identification and response of a polio event, without local poliovirus transmission or a polio outbreak with sustained transmission, helps and challenge EU countries to update their polio national preparedness plans. The EU/EEA area, in fact, is a peculiar area regarding the polio risk both for its vaccination policy, the large polio vaccines manufactures and the constant immigration from areas at polio high risk, but also EU include cultural and financial potentials crucial to sustain the polio end game strategy and reach the benefit of a world without polio risk. Poliovirus eradication will continue to be challenged as long as there is the worldwide presence of polioviruses in laboratories and vaccine production plants. Most of the world's OPV vaccines are produced in the EU and many laboratories and research centers store and handle polio viruses. EU Member States are engaged actively in implementing the poliovirus biocontainment plans that are part of the polio eradication strategy and to certify the destruction of poliovirus strains and potentially contaminated biological materials.

AB Despite wide vaccination coverage with efficacious vaccines, pertussis is still not under control in any country. Two types of vaccines are available for the primary vaccination series, diphtheria/tetanus/whole-cell pertussis and diphtheria/tetanus/acellular pertussis vaccines, in addition to reduced antigen content vaccines recommended for booster vaccination. Using these vaccines, several strategies are being explored to counter the current pertussis problems, including repeated vaccination, cocoon vaccination and maternal immunization. With the exception of the latter, none have proven their effectiveness, and even maternal vaccination is not expected to ultimately control pertussis. Therefore, new pertussis vaccines are needed, and several candidates are in early pre-clinical development. They include whole cell vaccines with low endotoxin content, outer membrane vesicles, new formulations, acellular vaccines with new adjuvants or additional antigens and live attenuated vaccines. The most advanced is the live attenuated nasal vaccine BPZE1. It provides strong protection in mice and non-human primates, is safe, even in immune compromised animals, and genetically stable after in vitro and in vivo passages. It also has interesting immunoregulatory properties without being immunosuppressive. It has successfully completed a first-in-man clinical trial, where it was found to be safe, able to transiently colonize the human respiratory tract and to induce immune responses in the colonized subjects. It is now undergoing further clinical development. As it is designed to reduce carriage and transmission of Bordetella pertussis, it may hopefully contribute to the ultimate control of pertussis.

AB The prevention of paediatric bacterial meningitis and septicaemia has recently entered a new era with the availability of two vaccines against capsular group B meningococcus (MenB). Both of these vaccines are based on sub-capsular proteins of the meningococcus, an approach that overcomes the challenges set by the poorly immunogenic MenB polysaccharide capsule but adds complexity to predicting and measuring the impact of their use.
   This review describes the development and use of MenB vaccines to date, from the use of outer membrane vesicle (OMV) vaccines in MenB outbreaks around the world, to emerging evidence on the effectiveness of the newly available vaccines. While recent data from the United Kingdom supports the potential for protein-based vaccines to provide direct protection against MenB disease in immunised children, further research is required to understand the breadth and duration of this protection. A more detailed understanding of the impact of immunisation with these vaccines on nasopharyngeal carriage of the meningococcus is also required, to inform both their potential to induce herd immunity and to preferentially select for carriage of strains not susceptible to vaccine-induced antibodies.
   Although a full understanding of the potential impact of these vaccines will only be possible with this additional information, the availability of new tools to prevent the devastating effect of invasive MenB disease is a significant breakthrough in the fight against childhood sepsis and meningitis.

AB With the increase in the number of routine vaccinations the development of pentavalent and hexavalent combination vaccines fitting the routine vaccination schedules became a necessity. In this respect, Europe has taken the lead in comparison with other world regions, and routine vaccination with pentavalent and hexavalent combinations including DTPa, Hib, HepB and IPV has been on European vaccination programs for >15 years. Since the marketing authorization of Hexavac (R) and Infanrix Hexa (R) in 2000, immunization schedules in most European countries have included hexavalent vaccines. In the last years, two new hexavalent vaccines have been licensed and commercialized worldwide. This paper presents a review of the pharmaceutical profiles of the three hexavalent vaccines currently available. In addition, we aim to review safety, co-administration, tolerability and other practical concerns of their use. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of this work was to prepare and evaluate cyclodextrins-modified poly(anhydride) nanoparticles to enhance the oral administration of glibenclamide. A conjugate polymer was synthesized by incorporating hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin to the backbone of poly(methylvinyl ether-co-maleic anhydride) via Steglich reaction. The degree of substitution of anhydride rings by cyclodextrins molecules was calculated to be 4.9% using H-NMR spectroscopy. A central composite design of experiments was used to optimize the preparative process. Under the optimal conditions, nanoparticles displayed a size of about 170 nm, a surface charge of - 47 mV and a drug loading of 69 mu g GB/mg. X-ray diffraction studies confirmed the loss of the crystalline structure of GB due to its dispersion into the nanoparticles, either included into cyclodextrin cavities or entrapped in the polymer chains. Glibenclamide was mainly release by Fickian-diffusion in simulated intestinal fluid. GB-loaded nanoparticles produced a hypolipidemic effect over C. elegans N2 wild-type and daf-2 mutant. The action mechanism included daf-2 and daf-28 genes, both implicated in the insulin signaling pathway of C. elegans. In summary, the covalent linkage of cyclodextrin to the poly(anhydride) backbone could be an interesting strategy to prepare nanoparticles for the oral administration of glibenclamide.

AB In the manufacture of tablets, especially in direct tableting processes, the flowability of excipient powders and formulated powders is one of the most important characteristics. In the past two decades, orally disintegrating tablets (ODTs) have been prepared as popular solid dosage forms for elderly patients. Many types of mannitol granules have been developed and marketed as new pharmaceutical excipients for ODTs, owing to the solubility and palatability of mannitol. Characterizing the flow behaviors of these mannitol granules is essential to their use.
   The flowability of mannitol excipients was the focus of the present study. A fine crystalline mannitol powder, eight commercial types of mannitol granules and four types of mannitol mixture granules were evaluated. Two flowability testers were used for comparing and analyzing the samples' flowabilities. A variety of methodologies were used: an assessment using Carr's index, a shear test and a dynamic flow test. Mannitol powder showed the lowest Carr's index, meaning the lowest flowability. Spherical mannitol granules showed the lowest angle of internal friction in the shear test and extremely low basic flow energy in the dynamic flow test. Larger granules showed relatively high values for Carr's index, but also a relatively high total flow energy.

AB Powder flow is critical to the success of various pharmaceutical processes such as tableting and capsule filling. Despite a plethora of flow characterisation techniques and parameters available, powder flow still remains to be a not well understood subject. Inter-relationships between the various powder flow parameters in particular have not been well established. Furthermore, while it is known that particle size and shape are important determinants of powder flow, their relative impact on individual flow parameter is unclear. In this study, granules were evaluated for their flow properties using various characterisation methods. Through multivariate analysis, flow parameters were classified based on the underlying physical granule property. Angle of repose, Hausner ratio, shear cell parameters and avalanche flow were found to be affected primarily by powder cohesion, which was in turn determined by the smallest granule size fraction. On the other hand, powder compressibility and inter-particulate friction were the main factors underlying basic flow energy. Angle of internal friction was primarily affected by particle roundness and did not appear to describe powder bulk flow properties. This study showed that while the various flow characterisation techniques were different in terms of their applications, there were common physical attributes that governed the measurements.

AB Traditional chemotherapy against breast cancer usually accompanied with metastasis. Thus, it is significant to enhance anti-tumor and anti-metastasis efficacy simultaneously. The extracellular environment of most tumors is acidic with pH 6.5-6.9, which play an important role in driving promotion of tumor metastasis. Herein, we developed an intratumoral injectable phospholipids-based phase separation gel (PPSG) co-loaded with 5-fluotouracil (5FU) and magnesium oxide (MgO), termed as 5FU MgO-PPSG. It was prepared by simple mixing, and showed in the appearance of a clear and yellow solution with good fluidity. After intratumoral injection, PPSG system achieved phase transition and sustained released alkaline substance to neutralize acidic microenvironment in tumor site. Both in vitro and in vivo research showed a strong anti-tumor and anti-metastasis efficacy. 4T1-bearing mice after administration with 5FU MgO-PPSG was achieved significantly prolonged survival time, compared with other groups. In conclusion, the novel 5FU MgO-PPSG system might have a great potential to improve treatment method against breast metastasis.

AB Despite the wide occurrence of crystallization in the pharmaceutical industry, deep understanding and fine control of the process remain a tricky issue. Nevertheless, the successful manufacturing of finished pharmaceutical products, as well as the structural determination of biopharmaceuticals, depend on the size, form, shape and purity of the crystals. The ability of substrates with precise chemistry and topological features to induce nucleation has been thoroughly assessed during the recent years. This paper reviews the major advances and discoveries in controlling small molecule drug and protein crystallization by means of engineered surfaces. By designing superficial properties and morphology, it has been possible to tune the polymorph outcome, shorten the nucleation induction time, impose specific crystal shapes, control the crystal size and carry out crystallization at very low supersaturation levels. Such achievements underline the potential of surface-induced crystallization to provide an ideal platform for the study of the nucleation process and gain control over its stochastic nature.

   FORMULATION
AB Although oral delivery of exenatide has significant advantages, its poor permeability through intestinal epithelial membranes and rapid digestion by pepsin and ereptase in the gastrointestinal tract make effective oral delivery of exenatide a formidable challenge. In this study, we constructed a zinc ion (Zn2+) and exenatide complex functionalized nanoparticle (NP) oral delivery system to overcome the above-mentioned issue. Polyethylene glycol-poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PEG-PLGA) was used as a drug carrier to escape enzymatic degradation in the gastrointestinal tract, and low molecular weight protamine (LMWP) was used as a functional group to increase penetration of NPs into the intestinal epithelium. The functionalized NPs exhibited significantly improved penetration across the intestinal epithelium, as shown by cell uptake and transmembrane transport experiments. Moreover, a significant hypoglycemic effect was observed in diabetic rats. The relative bioavailability of the orally administered functionalized NPs vs. subcutaneous injection was 7.44%, 29-fold that of the exenatide-Zn2+ solution group. These findings indicate that our modification could effectively improve exenatide treatment.

AB Ribbon solid fraction is one of the most important quality attributes during roll compaction/dry granulation. Accurate and precise determination is challenging and no in-line measurement tool has been generally accepted, yet. In this study, a new analytical tool with potential off-line as well as in-line applicability is described. It is based on the thermo-conductivity of the compacted material, which is known to depend on the solid fraction. A laser diode was used to punctually heat the ribbon and the heat propagation monitored by infrared thermography. After performing a Gaussian fit of the transverse ribbon profile, the scale parameter a showed correlation to ribbon solid fraction in off-line as well as in-line studies. Accurate predictions of the solid fraction were possible for a relevant range of process settings. Drug stability was not affected, as could be demonstrated for the model drug nifedipine. The application of this technique was limited when using certain fillers and working at higher roll speeds. This study showed the potentials of this new technique and is a starting point for additional work that has to be done to overcome these challenges.

AB Non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFB) characterized by permanent bronchial dilatation and recurrent infections has been clinically managed by long-term intermittent inhaled antibiotic therapy among other treatments. Herein we investigated dry powder inhaler (DPI) formulation of ciprofloxacin (CIP) nanoplex with mannitol/lactose as the excipient for NCFB therapy. The DPI of CIP nanoplex was evaluated against DPI of native CIP in terms of their (1) dissolution characteristics in artificial sputum medium, (2) ex vivo mucus permeability in sputum from NCFB and healthy individuals, (3) antibacterial efficacy in the presence of sputum against clinical Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains (planktonic and biofilm), and (4) cytotoxicity towards human lung epithelial cells. Despite their similarly fast dissolution rates in sputum, the DPI of CIP nanoplex exhibited superior mucus permeability to the native CIP (5-7 times higher) attributed to its built-in ability to generate highly supersaturated CIP concentration in the sputum. The superior mucus permeability led to the CIP nanoplex's higher antibacterial efficacy (> 3 log(10) CFU/mL). The DPI of CIP nanoplex exhibited similar cytotoxicity towards the lung epithelial cells as the native CIP indicating its low risk of toxicity. These results established the promising potential of DPI of CIP nanoplex as a new therapeutic avenue for NCFB.

AB In this study, we report pH-responsive liposomes consisting of hydrogenated soy phosphatidylcholine (HSPC) as a lipid, hyaluronic acid (HA) grafted with functional 3-diethylaminopropyl (DEAP) groups (hereafter denoted as HA-g-DEAP) as a pH-responsive polymer, and docetaxel (DTX) as an antitumor drug. DTX-loaded HSPC liposomes were prepared via a conventional liposome manufacturing procedure and then were decorated with HA-gDEAP (HA-g-DEAP(0.15), HA-g-DEAP(0.25), and HA-g-DEAP(0.40), according to the molar conjugate ratio of DEAP to HA) in an aqueous solution (pH 7.4), by sonication. The liposomes with HA-g-DEAP(0.40) allowed the efficient release of the encapsulated DTX content when the pH of the solution decreased to 6.5 (Le., endosomal pH), owing to the acidic pH-induced protonation of the DEAP anchored to the vesicular lipid bilayers. These hyaluronated liposomes were effective at entering the human colon carcinoma HCT-116 cells with a CD44 receptor overexpression. In an in vitro tumor cell cytotoxicity test, the DTX-loaded liposomes caused a significant increase in HCT-116 tumor cell death, revealing their pharmaceutical potential in tumor therapy.

AB Taste masking is important for some unpleasant tasting bioactives in oral dosage forms. Among many methods available for taste-masking, use of ion-exchange resin (IER) holds promise. IER combined with hot melt extrusion (HME) may offer additional advantages over solvent methods. IER provides taste masking by complexing with the drug ions and preventing drug dissolution in the mouth. Drug-IER complexation approaches described in literatures are mainly based either on batch processing or column eluting. These methods of drug-IER complexation have obvious limitations such as high solvent volume requirements, multiprocessing steps and extended processing time. Thus, the objective of this study was to develop a single-step, solvent-free, continuous HME process for complexation of drug-IER. The screening study evaluated drug to IER ratio, types of IER and drug complexation methods. In the screening study, a potassium salt of a weakly acidic carboxylate-based cationic IER was found suitable for the HME method. Thereafter, optimization study was conducted by varying HME process parameters such as screw speed, extrusion temperature and drug to IER ratio. It was observed that extrusion temperature and drug to IER ratio are imperative in drug-IER complexation through HME. In summary, this study has established the feasibility of a continuous complexation method for drug to IER using HME for taste masking.

The accurate measurement of EE demands clear separation of nanocarriers from free drugs, which so far has not been clearly validated due to a lack of functional tools to identify nanocarriers. Herein, an environment-responsive water-quenching fluorophore was employed to label and identify model nanocarriers, polycaprolactone nanoparticles (PN), methoxy polyethylene glycol-poly(d,l-lactic acid) polymeric micelles (PM) and solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN). The separation process of three commonly used methods (centrifugation, ultrafiltration and gel permeation chromatography) was visualized by live imaging. The separation efficiency of the centrifugation method is very poor, especially for PM (40 nm), SLN (100 nm) and PN (100 nm); only PN (200 nm) can be efficiently separated but at a consumption of enormous energy. The ultrafiltration method shows the best separation efficiency with only 0.32-0.93% of leakage of the nanocarriers. Gel permeation chromatography exhibits good separation as well but suffers from low recovery, a potential factor that might compromise the accuracy of EE measurement. In conclusion, the ultrafiltration method is the method of choice for efficient separation and accurate measurement of EE.

AB Cocrystals are homogenous (single-phase) crystalline structures composed by two or more components in a definite stoichiometric ratio bonded together by noncovalent bonds. Pharmaceutical industry has been showing interest in cocrystals due to their ability to improve active pharmaceutical ingredients (API's) properties, such as solubility, dissolution, bioavailability, stability and processability. The necessity for high-throughput screening methods and methods capable of producing cocrystals in an industrial scale still hinders the use of cocrystals by the pharmaceutical industry.
   The aim of this review is to present an extensive overview of the cocrystallization methods, focusing in the specificities of each technique, its advantages and disadvantages. The review is divided into solvent-based and solvent-free methods. The most appropriate methods to the different stages of cocrystals manufacture, from the screening phase to industrial production are identified. The use of continuous and scalable methods in cocrystal production as well as the implementation of quality-by-design and process analytical technology concepts are also addressed.

AB Continuous manufacturing (CM) offers quality and cost-effectiveness benefits over currently dominating batch processing. One challenge that needs to be addressed when implementing CM is traceability of materials through the process, which is needed for the batch/lot definition and control strategy. In this work the residence time distributions (RTD) of single unit operations (blender, roller compactor and tablet press) of a continuous dry granulation tableting line were captured with NIR based methods at selected mass flow rates to create training data. RTD models for continuous operated unit operations and the entire line were developed based on transfer functions. For semi-continuously operated bucket conveyor and pneumatic transport an assumption based the operation frequency was used. For validation of the parametrized process model, a pre-defined API step change and its propagation through the manufacturing line was computed and compared to mull-scale experimental runs conducted with the fully assembled continuous operated manufacturing line. This novel approach showed a very good prediction power at the selected mass flow rates for a complete continuous dry granulation line. Furthermore, it shows and proves the capabilities of process simulation as a tool to support development and control of pharmaceutical manufacturing processes.

AB In the present study, chitosan based polymer-lipid hybrid nanoparticles (PLNs) were prepared by a self-assembly method and their use as the carrier for oral absorption enhancement of enoxaparin was evaluated. The enoxaparin-loaded nanoparticles were composed of chitosan as the polymer and glyceryl monooleate as the lipid with a lipid/polymer mass ratio ranging from 0 to 0.3, and F127 was added as a stabilizer. It was found that the PLNs showed a higher surface hydrophobicity but mucoadhesive properties similar to those of chitosan based nanocomplexes. Results from DSC experiments and NMR solvent relaxation study indicate that glyceryl monooleate was completely incorporated into the nanoparticles and the lipid/polymer ratio affected the extent of lipid-polymer interaction inside the nanoparticles and the resultant internal structures. The stability of the PLNs in simulated gastrointestinal fluids was also affected by the lipid/polymer ratio; the best stability was shown by nanoparticles with a lipid/polymer ratio of 0.2. Nanoparticles with the optimal composition significantly enhanced the oral bioavailability of enoxaparin with a 4.5-fold increase in AUC in comparison with a solution of enoxaparin. In conclusion, GMO/CS based PLNs can provide a new insight to develop orally applicable delivery system for hydrophilic macromolecules. Their absorption can be enhanced with proposed PLNs and preparation of this PLNs was also found to be easy comparing to other similar methods.

AB There is an urgent need for developing nanocarrier of excellent biocompatibility which can selectively release drugs at desired locations that can increase intratumoral drug concentration and reduce side effects. Herein, we developed a highly biocompatible nanocarrier made of oxidized starch in delivering doxorubicin (DOX) for enhanced anti-cancer therapy. The 30% oxidized starch can spontaneously self-assemble into 30-50 nm spherical nanoassemblies under physiological concentrations. DO30 nanoassemblies possessed negligible toxicity in several cell lines and ICR mice, in contrast to severe toxicity of synthetic polyacrylic acid (PAA), both of which are carboxyl-abundant polymers. The biocompatible DO30 was further decorated with cyclic RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp-Phe-Cys) peptides via PEG linker to target alpha v beta 3 integrin overexpressed on HepG2 cells. RGD-PEG-DO30/DOX demonstrated an enhanced tumor-targeting ability and anti-cancer property in vitro and in vivo. In general, RGD-oxidized starch nanoassemblies showed a great potential as a new type of safe and effective nanocarrier for anticancer therapy.

AB The work was aimed at developing an in vitro method able to provide rapid and reliable evaluation of drug absorption through buccal mucosa. Absorption simulator apparatus endowed with an artificial membrane was purposely developed by experimental design. The apparent permeation coefficient (P-app) through excised porcine buccal mucosa of naproxen, selected as model drug, was the target value to obtain with the artificial membrane. The multivariate approach enabled systematic evaluation of the effect on the response (P-app) of simultaneous variations of the variables (kind of lipid components for support impregnation and relative amounts). A screening phase followed by a response-surface study allowed optimization of the lipid-mixture composition to obtain the desired P app value, and definition of a design space where all mixture components combinations fulfilled the desired target at a fixed probability level. The method offers a useful tool for a quick screening in the early stages of drug discovery and/or in preformulation studies, improving efficiency and chance of success in the development of buccal delivery systems. Further studies with other model drugs are planned to confirm the buccal absorption predictive capacity of the developed membrane.

AB Improvement of problematic dissolution and solubility properties of a model drug, furosemide, was investigated for poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimer complexes of the drug. Full and half generation dendrimers with amino and ester terminals respectively, were studied. In vitro release performance of these complexes was investigated at drug loads ranging 5-60% using simulated gastric fluids. Full generation dendrimers accommodated higher drug loads, outperformed half-generation complexes, and free drug. Pharmacokinetic studies in rats indicated that the dendrimer complexes markedly improved in the bioavailability of the drug compared to the unformulated drug. The G3.0-PAMAM dendrimer complex showed a two-fold increase in C-max and a 1.75-fold increase in AUC over the free drug. Additionally, T-max was shortened from approximately 25 to 20 min. One of the first all-atomistic molecular dynamics (AA-MD) simulation studies was performed to evaluate low-generation dendrimer-drug complexes as well as its pharmacokinetic performance. AA-MD provided insight into the intermolecular interactions that take place between the dendrimer and drug. It is suggested that the dendrimer not only encapsulates the drug, but can also orientate the drug in stabilized dispersion to prevent drug clustering which could impact release and bioavailability negatively. AA-MD can be a useful tool to develop dendrimer-based drug delivery systems.

AB Self-gelling DNA hydrogels with cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) motifs have been shown to exhibit high potency as vaccine adjuvants. However, their oral use is limited because of their thermodynamic and chemical instability in the gastrointestinal tract. In this study, we aimed to develop DNA hydrogel microspheres (Dgel-MS) coated with chitosan to improve their stability. Chitosan-coated Dgel-MS (Cs-Dgel-MS) was prepared by emulsifying Dgel to obtain the D-gel core, followed by mixing with microemulsions of chitosan for electrostatic coating. Fluorescence imaging of Cs-Dgel-MS labeled with fluorescent dyes showed that Dgel-MS (approximately 30 mu m) was coated with chitosan. The recovery efficiency of Alexa Fluor 488-DNA was 87.4 +/- 7.5%. To load a phosphorothioate CpG oligodeoxynucleotide into Dgel, a modified Dgel (mDgel) was designed and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran was loaded into Cs-mDgel-MS as a model compound. The recovery efficiency of Alexa Fluor 488-CpG1668 and FITC-dextran was 83.3 +/- 3.8% and 67.8 +/- 4.6%, respectively. The release of Alexa Fluor 488-CpG1668 from Cs-mDgel-MS was slower than that from mDgel under acidic or DNase conditions. Intra-duodenal administration of FITC-dextran/Cs-mDgel-MS showed prolonged intestinal transition of the encapsulated FITC-dextran.

AB Saxagliptin (SAX) is a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 enzyme inhibitor molecule now explored for its activity in the therapy of Alzheimer's disease. Being extremely hydrophilic, it is unable to permeate the blood-brain barrier by the conventional therapy modalities. Further repurposing the drug, SAX is associated with a reduction in the blood sugar level in the periphery. In the present study, the chitosan-c-valine conjugate was synthesized by carbodiimide chemistry. The conjugate was then used to prepare nanoparticles encapsulating SAX. The nanoparticles were characterized by particle size, surface morphology, and entrapment efficiency. The stability of the formulations was determined by incubation with rat plasma and brain homogenate. The blood brain barrier permeability of the nanoparticles was successfully demonstrated by the incorporation of fluorescent dye, Rhodamine B in the nanoparticles. In vivo studies were conducted in rats and the results showed that the nanoparticles were highly stable in the plasma releasing only a minute amount of SAX (2.5 ng/mL) which was less than the C-max of the pure SAX (51 ng/mL). The brain uptake studies showed an accumulation of 53 ng/mL SAX from the nanoparticles whereas the pure SAX showed no detectable amount of the drug after 24 h. The pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that nanoparticles had an (AUC(0-t) ) of 3.42 times lower than the pure SAX, indicating the stability of the prepared formulation in the plasma.

AB Mitochondria are considered the power house of cells where ATP is generated for cellular metabolism, and they also act as a crucial regulator of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway. During ATP synthesis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced as secondary products. Overproduction of ROS can promote mitochondrial DNA mutation, dysfunction and depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane, ultimately resulting in cell death. Therefore, the destruction of mitochondria would be an effective therapeutic approach to kill malignant tumors. Herein, we formulated a PEGylated alpha-TOS polymeric micellar system loaded with 10-hydroxycamptothecin (HCPT) drug to inhibit the nuclear topoisomerase I enzyme and disrupt the mitochondrial membrane to induce apoptosis. In addition, tumor-penetrating CRGDK peptide-functionalized TPGS 2k specifically bound to the Nrp-1 receptor to facilitate higher cell uptake of polymeric micelles by tumor cells. Experimental studies confirmed that HCPT-loaded and peptide-functionalized TPGS 2k -TOS micelles (HLPFTTM) showed an enhanced anti-cancer effect in A549 cancer cells.

AB Oral administration of proteins and peptides still is a challenging task to overcome due to low permeability through absorptive epithelia, degradation and metabolism that lead to poor bioavailability. Attempting to overcome such limitations, an antihypertensive peptide derived from whey protein, with KGYGGVSLPEW sequence, was incorporated for the first time into polymeric nanoparticles. An experimental design was followed in order to optimize drug-loading, association efficiency, mean particle size, zeta-potential and polydispersity index of a formulation of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles as carriers for bioactive peptides. In sequence, peptide-loaded PLGA nanoparticles were incorporated in a guar-gum film matrix, resulting in a combined delivery system aiming to promote slow release and permeation across buccal epithelium. Neither PLGA nanoparticles, guar-gum films nor the conjugation of PLGA nanoparticles and guar-gum films (GfNp) significantly compromised in vitro TR146 human buccal carcinoma cell line viability after 12 h contact, as assessed by 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-Diphenyltetrazolium Bromide reduction assay (MTT). In vitro release assay for developed formulations allowed to conclude that the combination of orodispersible film and nanoparticles granted a slower release of AhP when compared with PLGA or guar-gum films alone or with control. GfNp offered more effective, synergistic, in vitro permeation of TR146 cell multilayer in comparison with guar-gum films or PLGA nanoparticles alone. The combination of PLGA nanoparticles with guar-gum films represent a suitable alternative to conventional per os delivery systems, leading to an increased buccal permeability of carried antihypertensive peptide.

AB Since the discovery of amylin its use has been discouraged by the inadequacy of the protocol involving multiple injections in addition to insulin. We aimed here to develop a combined fixed-dose formulation of pramlintide with fast-acting insulin. We have investigated the compatibility of regular and fast-acting insulin analogues (Aspart, Asp(B28), and LisPro, Lys(B28)Pro(B29)) with the amylin analogue pramlintide by using electrospray ionization - ion mobility spectrometry-mass spectrometry (ESI-IMS-MS), kinetic aggregation assays monitored by thioflavin T, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in the evaluation of the aggregation product. Insulin interacts with pramlintide, forming heterodimers as probed by ESI-IMS-MS. While their interaction is likely to delay the amyloid aggregation of pramlintide in phosphate-buffered solution pH 7.0, they do not prevent aggregation at this condition. At acidic sodium acetate solution pH 5.0, combination of pramlintide and the fast-acting insulin analogues become stable against amyloid aggregation. The co-formulated product at high concentration of both pramlintide (600 mu g/mL,150 mu M) and LisPro insulin (50 IU/mL, 300 mu M) showed also stability against amyloid aggregation. These data indicate the physico-chemical short-term stability of the co-formulated preparation of LisPro insulin with pramlintide, which could bring benefits for the combined therapy.

AB Size and morphology distributions are critical to the performance of nano-drug systems, as they determine drug pharmacokinetics and biodistribution. Therefore, comprehensive and reliable analyses of these properties are required by both the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA). In this study, we compare two most commonly used approaches for assessing the size distribution and morphology of liposomal nano-drug systems, namely, dynamic light scattering (DLS) and cryogenic-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM); an automated quantitative analysis method was developed for the latter method. We demonstrate the advantages and disadvantages of each of these two approaches for a commercial formulation of the anti-cancer drug doxorubicin - Doxil (R), in which the drug is encapsulated, mostly in the form of nano-rod crystals. With increasing drug concentration, these nano-rods change the shape of the liposomes from spherical, before drug loading, to prolate (oval), post drug loading. Cryo-TEM analysis provides a detailed size distribution of both the liposomes (minor and major axes) and the nano-rod drug. Both these values are relevant to the drug performance. In this study, we show that at elevated drug concentration (2.75 mg/ml) the drug grows mainly along the major axis and that this high concentration can result, in some cases, in liposome rupture. We show that the combination of cryo-TEM and DLS constitutes a reliable tool for demonstrating the stability of the formulation in human plasma at body temperature, a characteristic that is crucial for achieving therapeutic efficacy.

AB Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is used in therapy for bone tissue repair because an abundance of osteogenesis-related growth factors can be released from the concentrated platelets. However, its clinical use is limited because growth factors, temporally released from PRP, are degraded rapidly. This study aimed to incorporate PRP-derived growth factors into SF/PCL/PVA nanofibers by coaxial electrospinning to determine the release profiles of growth factors and how the presence of these growth factors enhances the osteogenic abilities of the nanofibers. Scaffolds containing different ratios of PRP and PVA were prepared and characterized. We then quantified the release of growth factors from the nanofibers over time, and evaluated the proliferation, migration and osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. The in vivo osteogenic capacity of the PRP-containing core-shell NFS was also evaluated by transplanting the PRP/MSCs/CS/beta-TCP compounds into the skin on the back of nude mice and by treating cranial defects of C57BL/6 mice. The results of such treatments were analyzed by immunofluorescent staining, mu computed tomography (mu CT), and histological observation. The results show that coaxial nanofibers with a PRP-5% PVA solution ratio of 7:1 contained a relatively high amount of PRP and exhibited a more uniform distribution of fiber diameters. The bioactivity of the scaffolds was enhanced due to the increased proliferation and migration of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). When the cells were inoculated and cultured on the PRP-loaded nanofibrous mats, the expression of collagen type II also increased. Furthermore, new bone formation was also promoted by PRP-NFS after 8 weeks of implantation. In conclusion, this study shows that the incorporation of PRP had positive effects on the bioactivity and osteogenic ability of coaxial nanofibrous mats. Such nanofibrous mats may prove beneficial in various applications of bone tissue engineering.

AB Oral therapy with 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) may cause major side effects, whereas the topical treatment might not be much effective due to the low penetration induced by typical formulations. Therefore, the objectives of this work are the development and characterization of a nanoemulsion (NE) containing 8-MOP together with an ex vivo permeation study, monitored by a validated HPLC-Fluo method, to determine the amount of drug retained in viable skin (epidermis (E) and dermis (D)) and in stratum corneum (SC). The optimized conditions for NE formulation were achieved by full factorial designs (2(5) and 3(2)): 60 s and 60% of ultrasound time and potency, respectively; 10 mL of final volume; 2% v/v of oil phase (clove essential oil); and 10% m/v of Poloxamer 407. The NE showed mean droplet diameter of 24.98 +/- 0.49 nm, polydispersity index (PDI) of 0.091 +/- 0.23, pH values of 6.54 +/- 0.06, refractive index of 1.3525 +/- 0.0001 and apparent viscosity of 51.15 +/- 3.66 mPa at 20 degrees C. Droplets with nanospherical diameters were also observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Ex vivo permeation study showed that 8.5% of the applied 8-MOP dose permeated through the biological membranes, with flux (J) of 1.35 mu g cm(-2) h(-1). The drug retention in E + D and in SC was 10.15 +/- 1.36 and 1.95 +/- 0.71 mu g cm(-2), respectively. Retention in viable skin induced by the NE was almost two-fold higher than a compounded cream (5.04 +/- 0.30 mu g cm(-2)). These results suggested that the developed NE is a promising alternative for 8-MOP topical therapy when compared to commercial formulations.

AB Resistance to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) is a major clinical problem. The overexpression of P-glycoprotein (Pgp), one of the main transporters limiting the entry of xenobiotics into the brain, is among the factors contributing to the AED resistance. Presently, there is no consensus on the interaction of carbamazepine (CBZ) with the Pgp. This study investigates the effect of the Pgp inhibitor verapamil on the anticonvulsant effect of CBZ and its nanoparticulate formulation in the rat model of isoniazid-induced epilepsy. Verapamil significantly increased the anticonvulsant effect of CBZ and reduced its effective dose by at least 30% (from 30 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg). Binding of carbamazepine to the poloxamer 188-coated PLGA nanoparticles enabled a 30-fold increase of its anticonvulsive effect, as compared to the free drug. The inhibition of Pgp did not influence the effectivity of carbamazepine encapsulated in nanoparticles.

AB A delivery system based on poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) polymer (PLGA) microparticles has been developed for parenteral administration of the local anesthetic prilocaine in its free base form. Both drug-free and drug-loaded microparticles, prepared by a double-emulsion-evaporation method, were characterized for mean size by Laser Diffraction Analysis, while their morphology was investigated by scanning electron microscopy. The preparation technique allowed obtainment of homogeneous microparticles of about 25 mu m diameter, suitable for subcutaneous administration. The encapsulation efficiency, determined by both direct and indirect methods, was around 36-38%. Differential Scanning Calorimetry was used to characterize the solid state of the raw materials, assess drug-polymer compatibility and miscibility and highlight possible modifications of the components induced by the preparation method. In vitro release studies showed a sustained release profile, with about 80% of drug released after the first 24 h. The anesthetic effect of the formulation was evaluated in vivo on rats, according to the test of cutaneous trunci muscle reflex. Administration of prilocaine base as PLGA microparticles allowed to significantly enhance both extent (60% AUC increase) and duration (100% increase) of the anesthetic effect in the animal model, in comparison with the equivalent dose of prilocaine hydrochloride aqueous solution.

AB This work demonstrates the use of multi-scale simulations coupled with experiments to build a quantitative prediction tool for the performance of adhesive mixtures in a dry powder inhaler (DPI). Using discrete element model (DEM), the behaviour of fine-carrier particle assemblies upon different mechanisms encountered during dose entrainment and dispersion can be described at the individual particle level. Combining these results with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, the complete dosing event from a DPI can be captured and key performance measures can be extracted. A concept of apparent surface energy, ASE, was introduced to overcome challenges associated with the complex particle properties, e.g. irregular particle shapes and surface roughness. This approach correctly predicts trends observed experimentally regarding API adhesivity, flow rate and device geometry. By incorporating the effects of drug load, critical adhesion and surface energy distributions to the simulation tool, the fine particle fraction could be predicted with good agreement to experiments for two different formulations in two different devices at two flow rates. It is concluded that multi-scale simulations provide a useful tool to support device and formulation development, as well as to gain further insight into the physical mechanisms governing dispersion from DPIs.

AB Three-dimensional printing (3DP) is gaining momentum in the field of pharmaceuticals, offering innovative opportunities for medicine manufacture. Selective laser sintering (SLS) is a novel, high resolution and single-step printing technology that we have recently introduced to the pharmaceutical sciences. The aim of this work was to use SLS 3DP to fabricate printlets (3D printed tablets) with cylindrical, gyroid lattice and bi-layer structures having customisable release characteristics. Paracetamol-loaded constructs from four different pharmaceutical grade polymers including polyethylene oxide, Eudragit (L100-55 and RL) and ethyl cellulose, were created using SLS 3DP. The novel gyroid lattice structure was able to modulate the drug release from all four polymers. This work is the first to demonstrate the feasibility of using SLS to achieve customised drug release properties of several polymers, in a swift, cost-effective manner, avoiding the need to alter the formulation composition. By creating these constructs, it is therefore possible to modify drug release, which in practice, could enable the tailoring of drug performance to the patient simply by changing the 3D design.

AB Melatonin (MLT), a hormone secreted from the pineal gland, is recognized as a potential candidate for stimulation of bone regeneration. However, because of its hydrophobicity, the administration of MLT to stimulate bone regeneration is difficult. In this study, an inclusion complex of MLT with 2-hydroxypropyl beta-cyclodextrin (HP-beta-CD) was prepared to improve the water solubility, and the osteogenic differentiation ability of the inclusion complex was investigated in MC3T3-E1 cells. The formation of HP-beta-CD/MLT inclusion complex was confirmed by H-1 and C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and wide-angle X-ray diffraction. The water solubility of MLT increased linearly upon addition of HP-beta-CD because of the formation of the inclusion complex. Additionally, treatment of the cells with HP-beta-CD/MLT inclusion complex showed higher uptake amount of MLT than that treated with free MLT. In addition, treatment of MC3T3-E1 cells with HP-beta-CD/MLT inclusion complex increased alkaline phosphatase activity and mineralized matrix deposition, compared to that in free MLT-treated and untreated cells. Furthermore, cells treated with HP-beta-CD/MLT inclusion complex exhibited higher expression levels of osteogenic differentiation genes than those in the untreated and free MLT-treated cells. Accordingly, these results suggested that inclusion complexation of MLT with HP-beta-CD would be a potential formulation for bone regeneration because of its improved solubility and enhanced osteogenic differentiation efficiency.

AB Currently, the two technologies primarily used for the manufacturing of nano-crystalline suspensions using top down process (i.e. wet milling) are high pressure homogenization (HPH) and stirred bead milling (SBM). These two technologies are based upon different mechanisms, i.e., cavitation forces for HPH and shear forces for stirred bead milling. In this article, the HPH and SBM technologies are compared in terms of the impact of the suspension composition the process parameters and the technological configuration on milling performances and physical quality of the suspensions produced. The data suggested that both HPH and SBM are suitable for producing nano-crystalline suspensions, although SBM appeared more efficient than HPH, since the limit of milling (d(50)) for SBM was found to be lower than that obtained with HPH (100 nm vs 200 nm). For both these technologies, regardless of the process parameters used for milling and the scale of manufacturing, the relationship of d(90) versus d(50) could be described by a unique master curve (technology signature of milling pathway) outlining that the HPH leads to more uniform particle size distribution as compared to SBM.

AB This study was undertaken to generate a novel dual targeting fusion protein (DTF), targeting tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin 17A (IL-17A), and determine its anti-arthritis properties in vitro and in vivo. DTF consisted of an anti-IL-17A single chain variable fragment, a soluble TNF receptor 1, and an Fc fragment. Both clinical and histopathological evaluations suggest that DTF and etanercept can ameliorate collagen induced arthritis. However, the arthritis severity score of DTF-treated mice was lower than that of etanercept-treated mice. In addition, DTF was more potent than etanercept in decreasing the ratio of RANKL/OPG in the serum and rebalancing the population ratio of Treg/Th17 cells in the spleens. In vitro, IL-17A and TNF-alpha had synergistic effects in inducing the expression of inflammatory cytokines in fibroblast-like synoviocyte from RA patients (RAFLS), human leukemia (THP-1), and rheumatoid synovial fibroblast (MH7A). IL-17A and TNF-alpha also had synergistic effects in inducing proliferation and migration of MH7A cells. However, we observed that DTF was more efficient than etanercept in suppressing these synergistic effects. Our results demonstrate that DTF is highly efficient in the treatment of arthritis and has the potential to overcome the limited therapeutic responses obtained with single cytokine neutralization.

AB The objective of this study was to innovate an effective oral sustained release hepatoprotective formula for - the water soluble drug - caffeine. Caffeine is rapidly absorbed and eliminated which dictates frequent administration to achieve adequate therapeutic effect. A w/o Pickering emulsion incorporating caffeine in the internal phase was primed. It contained wheat germ oil and was stabilized by synthesized magnesium oxide nanoparticles (MgO NPs). Components selection was based on their antioxidant, hepatoprotective and anticarcinogenic effects. The MgO NPs were prepared via sol-gel method, and then were characterized using X-ray diffractometry, transmission electron microscopy, contact angle and cytotoxicity. The Pickering emulsion formula stabilized by MgO NPs (Fl) was compared to another stabilized by conventional MgO particles (F2). Both were evaluated regarding droplet size, stability and caffeine release. Fl was stable against phase separation for a 2 months period. Its droplets mean size was 665.9 +/- 90 nm. Fl afforded sustained release for caffeine that reached 70% within 48 h that followed zero order kinetics. 100 ppm of Fl showed nearly 36% growth inhibition of hepatocellular carcinoma (HEPG2). In vivo and histopathalogical evaluations were conducted on CCl4 intoxicated rats. Biochemical analysis for liver enzymes - (ALT and AST), oxidative stress biomarkers and the inflammation marker (protein kinase C) - revealed that the selected formula elicited significant hepatoprotection. This formula acted as an economical approach to multiple therapy and afforded safe effective sustained level for caffeine.

AB Polymeric microparticles are micro carriers for the sustained drug delivery of drugs in the lungs, used as alternatives to the use of established excipients. This study aims to develop and characterize inhalable ciprofloxacin (CPx)-loaded poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) microparticles by a single-step spray-drying procedure. The optimization of the processing parameters was achieved by an orthogonal design of the most relevant processing parameters (polymer concentration, feed rate and inlet temperature). The obtained spray-dried particles showed a drug encapsulation efficiency higher than 90%. Furthermore, PVA-CPx formulations, with drug contents up to 10 wt%, showed a morphology and size suitable for inhalation, with a sustained release profile over 24 h. Data from Fourier transformed infra-red spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry indicated absence of interaction between the polymer matrix and the drug. Aerodynamic assessment of PVA CPx 10wt% was determined by the next generation impactor (NGI), using spray-dried CPx as a control. The results showed improved values of mass median aerodynamic diameter (5.06 +/- 0.10 mu m) and a fine particle fraction (39.78 +/- 0.98%) when comparing with the CPx alone (5.33 +/- 0.39 mu m and 30.43 +/- 1.38%). This study highlights the potential of spray-dried PVA microparticles as drug carriers for lung local delivery of antibiotics.

AB Repetitive intravitreal injections of Methotrexate (MTX), a hydrophilic chemotherapeutic drug, are currently used to treat selected vitreoretinal (VR) diseases, such as intraocular lymphoma. To avoid complications associated with the rapid release of MTX from the injections, a Polylactic acid (PLA) and Chitosan (CS)-based MTX micro-implant prototype was fabricated in an earlier study, which showed a sustained therapeutic release rate of 0.2-2.0 mu g/day of MTX for a period similar to 1 month in vitro and in vivo. In the current study, different combinations of Poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA)/PLA coatings were used for lipophilic surface modification of the CS-MTX micro-implant, such as PLGA 5050, PLGA 6535 and PLGA 7525 (PLA: PGA - 50:50, 65:35, 75:25, respectively; M.W: 54,400 - 103,000) and different PLA, such as PLA 100 and PLA 250 (MW: 102,000 and 257,000, respectively). This improved the duration of total MTX release from the coated CS-MTX micro-implants to similar to 3-5 months. With an increase in PLA content in PLGA and molecular weight of PLA, a) the initial burst of MTX and the mean release rate of MTX can be reduced; and b) the swelling and biodegradation of the micro-implants can be delayed. The controlled drug release mechanism is caused by a combination of diffusion process and hydrolysis of the polymer coating, which can be modulated by a) PLA content in PLGA and b) molecular weight of PLA, as inferred from Korsmeyer Peppas model, Zero order, First order and Higuchi model fits. This improved micro-implant formulation has the potential to serve as a platform for controlled release of hydrophilic drugs to treat selected VR diseases.

AB Mannitol is commonly used as a pharmaceutical excipient for tablets; the most widely used oral dosage form for drug delivery. For tableting, mannitol is provided in two different forms: native crystals and textured particles. In order to optimize its formulation, a good understanding of the mechanical behavior mechanism of mannitol is necessary. Thus, the aim of this study is to evaluate the deformation mechanism of native mannitol crystals presenting different particle sizes. Pharmaco-technical and compression studies were performed using mannitol with different mean diameters (160 mu m, 50 mu m and 25 mu m). Lactose (monohydrate) and microcrystalline cellulose were used as brittle and plastic reference materials, respectively. Tableting tests and mathematical models, HECKEL and WALKER, were used to study the deformation mechanism of mannitol (beta). Mean Yield Pressure (Py) and WALKER coefficient (W) values showed that the studied crystalline mannitol presents a deformation mechanism close to brittle material. A particle-size analyzer was used at different pulverization pressures to show the high sensibility of the mannitol particles to fragmentation when exposed to high pressures, especially for particles presenting 160 mu m size. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was used to show the fragmentation after high-pressure

AB A spray drying process was standardized to prepare an inhalable powder comprising D-cycloserine and ethionamide, two "second line" drugs employed for treating multi-drug resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB). The aim of the process development effort was to maximize product yield. Contour plots were generated using a small central composite design (CCD) with face centered (alpha = 1) to maximize the process yield as the response criterion. The design space was experimentally validated. Powder was prepared and characterized for drug content (HPLC), geometric size (laser scattering), surface morphology (scanning electron microscopy) aerosol behaviour (cascade impaction) and powder flow properties. The optimized process yielded a powder with a median mass aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) of 1.76 mu +/- 3.1 geometric standard deviation (GSD). Mass balance indicated that the major proportion of the particles produced by spray drying are lost to the outlet filter. The process represents a best-case compromise of spray-drying conditions to minimize loss during droplet drying, collection and process air discharge.

   DISPOSITION
AB Pharmaceutical excipients that may affect gastrointestinal (GI) drug absorption are called critical pharmaceutical excipients, or absorption-modifying excipients (AMEs) if they act by altering the integrity of the intestinal epithelial cell membrane. Some of these excipients increase intestinal permeability, and subsequently the absorption and bioavailability of the drug. This could have implications for both the assessment of bioequivalence and the efficacy of the absorption-enhancing drug delivery system. The absorption-enhancing effects of AMEs with different mechanisms (chitosan, sodium caprate, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)) have previously been evaluated in the rat single-pass intestinal perfusion (SPIP) model. However, it remains unclear whether these SPIP data are predictive in a more in vivo like model. The same excipients were in this study evaluated in rat and dog intraintestinal bolus models. SDS and chitosan did exert an absorption-enhancing effect in both bolus models, but the effect was substantially lower than those observed in the rat SPIP model. This illustrates the complexity of the AME effects, and indicates that additional GI physiological factors need to be considered in their evaluation. We therefore recommend that AME evaluations obtained in transit-independent, preclinical permeability models (e.g. Ussing, SPIP) should be verified in animal models better able to predict in vivo relevant GI effects, at multiple excipient concentrations.

ID OPTICAL COHERENCE TOMOGRAPHY; DRUG-DELIVERY SYSTEMS; INK; FORMULATIONS;

AB In contact-less printing, such as piezo-electric drop on demand printing used in the study, the drop formation process is independent of the substrate. This means that having developed a printable formulation, printed pharmaceutical dosage forms can be obtained on any pharmaceutical grade substrate, such as polymer-based films. In this work we evaluated eight different oral films based on their suitability as printing substrates for sodium picosulfate. The different polymer films were compared regarding printed spot morphology, chemical stability and dissolution profile. The morphology of printed sodium picosulfate was investigated with scanning electron microscopy and optical coherence tomography. The spreading of the deposited drops was found to be governed by the contact angle of the ink with the substrate. The form of the sodium picosulfate drops changed on microcrystalline cellulose films at ambient conditions over 8 weeks and stayed unchanged on other tested substrates. Sodium picosulfate remained amorphous on all substrates according to small and wide angle X-ray scattering, differential scanning calorimetry and polarized light microscopy measurements. The absence of chemical interactions between the drug and substrates, as indicated by infrared spectroscopy, makes all tested substrates suitable for printing sodium picosulfate onto them.

AB According to the list published by the WHO for global top ten causes of death, lung diseases contribute nearly one-third of the total mortality. The current treatment on lung diseases provide only symptomatic relief rather than restoring the complete lung functions. Nanostructured lipid carriers-based drug delivery system (NLCs-based DDS) provide a breakthrough in treating various lung diseases.
   This review provides the readers with background information for rationale behind focusing lung diseases and selection of targeted drug delivery to treat these diseases. This review discusses different hurdles in targeting the lung diseases and possible remedy in the form of NLCs-based DDS. The review gives an overview of the existing literature about the quality, safety, and efficacy of the NLCs-based DDS for pulmonary targeting.
   Different surface-engineered NLCs enormously proved their effectiveness in targeting the drug and other bioactive agents to the site of infection. Their results of safety and efficacy studies in in-vitro and in-vivo evaluations are encouraging. This advises the bright future of NLCs-based DDS for pulmonary targeting. To bring this optimistic NLCs-based DDS to the market, a thorough pre-clinical and clinical investigation hold prime importance.

TI Effect of glycerol on the physical and mechanical properties of thin
   gellan gum films for oral drug delivery
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICS
LA English
DT Article
DE Thin films; Gellan gum; Glycerol; Buccal delivery; Fluconazole
AB In this work, deacylated gellan gum and the plasticizer glycerol were used as primary components for the preparation of thin films intended for the oral delivery of therapeutic molecules. The samples were prepared by a solvent casting method and characterized for their thickness, tensile properties, swelling ability, mucoadhesion capacity and uniform drug distribution. The amount of glycerol was varied from 20% to 75% w/w in order to obtain films with tunable mechanical properties and high drug loading efficiency. The addition of glycerol was able to positively influence the mechanical characteristics of gellan gum thin film overcoming the brittleness caused by the rigid interconnection among the polymeric chains. Plasticized gellan gum films containing 50% w/ w of glycerol showed optimal mechanical resistance and mucoadhesion capacity, which were adversely affected by the inclusion of higher concentrations of glycerol. On the contrary, only high amounts of the plasticizer (>70% w/w) enabled a homogeneous distribution of the model drug fluconazole within the polymeric matrix. Overall, these results indicate that gellan gum-based thin films can be potentially used for buccal drug delivery upon precise selection of the appropriate concentration of glycerol used as a plasticizer.

AB The major clinical hindrance of orthopedic implants is the bacterial infection, which can lead to biofilm formation and ultimately results in implant rejection. In this research, layer-by-layer nanocoating consists of vancomycin/PLA/vancomycin-loaded niosomes was designed. Vancomycin-loaded niosomes were formulated by thin film hydration method and the attributes of niosomes in terms of size, zeta potential, drug loading and EE, were assessed. The size was 340.5 +/- 2.95 nm with the zeta potential and %EE was 45.4 +/- 0.77 mV and 50.47 +/- 3.66% respectively. The dip coating technique was used to deposit a thin film, which was characterized morphologically under FE-SEM. Drug release from coated bone plates with and without vancomycin-loaded niosomes was also studied and results suggested that bone plates coated with vancomycin-loaded niosomes have accumulated more vancomycin than the control group and hence aided in the prolonged release up to two weeks. These niosomes-coated bone plates demonstrated superior antibacterial activity for longer time period, without exhibiting any cytotoxic effects towards normal cells (L929). These findings offer a promising approach to control the bacterial colonization and biofilms formation. This thin film nano-coating can also be utilized in coating of other medical devices, which are prone to infections.

AB The monitoring of blood glucose is a key aspect of diabetes care in limiting the negative effects of hyperglycaemia to both the microvasculature and macrovasculature. Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) gives an indication of blood glucose at a specific point in time and is recommended to be carried out four times daily. However, due to the inconvenience and associated pain of blood withdrawal, SMBG is often carried out less frequently than recommended or not at all. Extraction and subsequent determination of glucose in interstitial fluid (ISF) using microneedles (MNs) is an emerging area of research due to their minimally invasive nature and lack of associated pain. In this manuscript, a novel method for the fabrication of a hollow microneedle device is reported. The microneedle produced had a sharp bevelled edge and was 400 mu m in length. Additionally, a paper backplate embedded with a colorimetric system for the rapid visual determination of glucose in simulated ISF was developed and paired with the hollow MN. This device rapidly extracted simulated ISF within five seconds and its ability to produce a glucose concentration dependent colour change within 30 s was demonstrated. Using this approach, it was possible to discriminate between glucose concentrations in normal glycaemia (4-7 mM) and hyperglycaemia ( > 7 mM) ranges using the naked eye. While further development is required, the results herein highlight the potential of this device to be used as a blood-free minimally invasive approach to glucose monitoring.

AB In this study, we aimed to investigate the immunogenicity of cationic liposomes loaded with diphtheria toxoid (DT) and poly(I:C) after hollow microneedle-mediated intradermal vaccination in mice. The following liposomal formulations were studied: DT loaded liposomes, a mixture of free DT and poly(I:C)-loaded liposomes, a mixture of DT-loaded liposomes and free poly(I:C), and liposomal formulations with DT and poly(I:C) either individually or co-encapsulated in the liposomes. Reference groups were DT solution adjuvanted with or without poly(I:C) (DT/poly(I:C)). The liposomal formulations were characterized in terms of particle size, zeta potential, loading and release of DT and poly(I:C). After intradermal injection of BALB/c mice with the formulations through a hollow microneedle, the immunogenicity was assessed by DT-specific ELISAs. All formulations induced similar total IgG and IgG1 titers. However, all the liposomal groups containing both DT and poly(I:C) showed enhanced IgG2a titers compared to DT/poly(I:C) solution, indicating that the immune response was skewed towards a Th1 direction. This enhancement was similar for all liposomal groups that contain both DT and poly(I:C) in the formulations. Our results reveal that a mixture of DT encapsulated liposomes and poly(I:C) encapsulated liposomes have a similar effect on the antibody responses as DT and poly(I:C) co-encapsulated liposomes. These findings may have implications for future design of liposomal vaccine delivery systems.

AB Metastable crystal form I of the antibiotic clarithromycin has a pharmaceutically valuable characteristic that its crystalline phase transition can be applied for its sustained release from tablets. The phase transition of form I was investigated in detail by single crystal and powder X-ray analyses, dynamic vapor sorption analysis and thermal analysis. The single crystal structure of form I revealed that form I was not an anhydrate crystal but contained a partially occupied water molecule in the channel-like void space. Dynamic vapor sorption (DVS) analysis demonstrated that form I crystals reversibly sorbed water molecules in two steps when the relative humidity (RH) increased and finally transited to hydrate form IV at 95% RH. DVS analysis also showed that when the RH decreased form IV crystals lost water molecules at 40% RH and transited to the newly identified anhydrate crystal form VII.

AB Four molecular weights of poly-L-lysine (PLL) [1000-5000 Da, 1500-8000 Da, 4000-15,000 Da and 15,000-30,000 Da] and three molecular weights of polyethyleneimine (PEI) [800 Da, 2,000 Da, and 25,000 Da] were used to systematically study the effect of calcium (Ca2+) to improve transfection efficiency of polyelectrolyte complexes. Complexes made using different molecular weights of PLL or PEI polymer showed clear differences in the levels of gene expression in the presence and absence of calcium chloride when tested using A549 human lung carcinoma cells. Complexes formed from PLL or PEI 800 Da were exhibited negligible expression of pDNA according to a luciferase reporter assay. Low molecular weight PLL and PEI 800 Da, however, became highly efficient gene delivery vehicles when calcium was added to the nascent complexes while maintaining the low cytotoxicity of low molecular weight polyamines. Additional analyses indicated that the most effective formulations utilized a threshold level of calcium, which created small, stable particles, but also facilitated unpackaging of the gene complexes and release of pDNA.

AB The aim of this study was to develop a self-emulsifying drug delivery system (SEDDS) containing the fluoroquinolone antibiotic ciprofloxacin (CIP) exhibiting highly mucus permeating properties and antimicrobial activity in in vitro models. Various SEDDS formulations were developed and evaluated regarding droplet size, polydispersity index, zeta potential and formulation stability. Furthermore, SEDDS permeating properties were investigated in porcine intestinal mucus, as well as in cystic fibrosis (CF) sputum freshly collected from CF patients using Transwell (R) setup and single particle tracking (SPT), respectively. In order to evaluate antibacterial activity in an in vitro model against Staphylococcus aureus and other pathogens, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and time-kill curves were determined. In addition, in vitro release of ciprofloxacin and cytotoxicity studies were conducted. The preselected formulations F1 and F11 exhibited a mean droplet size of 79 nm and 25 nm, respectively, and a negative zeta potential. SEDDS containing CIP exhibit improved ability to permeate porcine intestinal mucus and CF sputum. After 4 h, F1-CIP formulation resulted in a 1.6 - fold and F11-CIP a 2.0 - fold higher amount of permeated ciprofloxacin through the sputum layer with respect to free CIP. Moreover, the antimicrobial activity of F11-CIP against S. aureus was higher than that of free CIP. According to these results, SEDDS formulations should be taken into consideration as promising delivery systems for the treatment of pulmonary infections accompanied by mucus dysfunction.

AB This study examines the preparation of sustained-release lidocaine polyelectrolyte complex using reactive melt extrusion. Eudragit L100-55 was selected as the ionic polymer. The influence of drug forms (freebase vs. hydrochloride salt) on lidocaine-Eudragit L100-55 interactions, physical stability, and dissolution properties of extrudates was investigated. It was confirmed by DSC, FT-IR and Raman spectroscopy that polyelectrolyte could only form via the acid-base reaction between Eudragit L100-55 and lidocaine freebase. Due to this ionic interaction, the lidocaine extrudate was physically more stable than the lidocaine hydrochloride extrudate during the storage under stressed condition. Drug release from lidocaine extrudate was a function of drug solubility, polymer solubility, drug-polymer interaction, and drug-induced microenvironment pH. At 30% drug loading, extrudate exhibited sustained release in aqueous media at pH 1.2 and 4.5. Due to the alkaline microenvironment pH induced by dissolved lidocaine, Eudragit L100-55 was solubilized and sustained-release was not achieved in water and aqueous media at pH 5.5. In comparison, lidocaine hydrochloride induced an acidic microenvironment. Drug release of lidocaine hydrochloride extrudate was similar at pH 1.2, 4.5, 5.5 and water with drug being released over 10 h. The release of lidocaine hydrochloride from the extrudates in these media was primarily controlled by microenvironment pH. It is concluded that different forms of lidocaine resulted in different drug-polymer interactions and distinctive physicochemical properties of extrudates.

AB A novel delivery system based on self-assembled liposome from multi-layered fibrous mucoadhesive membrane has been developed to improve the bioavailability of Carvedilol (Car). This system consisted of an electrospun layer (enable self-assembly of liposome once contacting with water), an adhesive layer (prolong the retention period in the mouth) and a backing layer. SEM, DSC and FTIR were applied to characterize the fiber. The TEM and fluorescence study demonstrated the formation of self-assembled liposome when electrospun fiber encountered water. The ratio of PC to Car and the molecular weight of PVP both had a significant impact on the drug encapsulation efficiency. In vitro and in vivo adhesive tests were conducted to evaluate the bioadhesive performance of the adhesive layer. The dialysis dissolution and permeation study through porcine buccal mucosa were carried out. The electrospun fiber showed excellent drug permeation amount compared to pure Car. The drug concentration-time curves, in rabbits, of fibrous mucoadhesive membrane and Car suspension were different, and possible reasons were analyzed. The pharmacokinetic study demonstrated 154% increase in the relative bioavailability compared to Car suspension. This drug delivery system offered a novel platform for potential buccal delivery of drugs with high first-pass effect

AB Based on the knowledge that poly(sialic acid) is a critical element for tumour development and that the receptors for its monomer are expressed on neutrophils, which play important roles in the progression and invasion of tumours, a poly(sialic acid)-p-octadecylamine conjugate (PSA-p-ODA) was synthesised and used to modify the surface of liposomal pixantrone (Pix-PSL) to improve the delivery of Pix to peripheral blood neutrophils (PBNs). The liposomes were fabricated using a remote loading technology via a pH gradient, and were then assessed for particle size, encapsulation efficiency, in vitro release, in vitro cytotoxicity, and pharmacokinetics. Simultaneously, in vitro and in vivo cellular uptake studies demonstrated that Pix-PSL provided an enhanced accumulation of Pix in PBNs. An in vivo study showed that the anti-tumour activity of Pix-PSL was superior to that of other formulations, probably owing to the efficient targeting of PBNs by Pix-PSL, after which PBNs containing Pix-PSL (Pix-PSL/PBNs) in the circulatory system are recruited by the tumour microenvironment. These findings suggest that PSA-p-ODA-decorated liposomal Pix may provide a neutrophil-mediated drug delivery system (DDS) for the eradication of tumours, and thus represents a promising approach for the tumour targeting of chemotherapeutic treatments.

AB The main objective of this study was the development and optimization of fluorometholone-loaded PLGA nanoparticles for the treatment of inflammatory conditions of the eye. Design of experiments was used to obtain nanoparticles with the best physicochemical characteristics. The optimized nanoparticles containing 1.5 mg.mL(-1) of fluorometholone showed a negative surface charge (-30 mV) and an average size below 200 nm being suitable for ocular administration. Drug-polymer interaction studies confirmed no new bonds were formed during the synthesis. Nanoparticles performance was assessed with biopharmaceutical behavior studies, ocular tolerance, anti-inflammatory efficacy and bioavailability. The biopharmaceutical behavior of the drug from nanoparticles was adjusted to hyperbola order showing a significantly greater permeation in the cornea than in the sclera. The optimized formulation had significantly greater anti-inflammatory effects than the commercial formulation. In addition, nanoparticles increased drug penetration toward the vitreous. Polymeric nanoparticles of fluorometholone could provide a suitable alternative for the treatment of inflammatory disorders of the anterior and posterior segments of the eye against of conventional topical formulations.

AB Drug treatment remains the most effective global approach to managing and preventing tuberculosis. This work focuses on formulating and evaluating an optimized polyvinyl alcohol-polyethylene glycol based orodispersible strip containing isoniazid, a first-line anti-tubercular agent. A solvent casting method guided through a Taguchi experimental design was employed in the fabrication, optimization and characterization of the orodispersible strip. The optimized strip was physically amalgamated with a monolayer, uniformly distributed surface geometry. It was 159.2 +/- 3.0 mu m thick, weighed 36.9 +/- 0.3 mg, had an isoniazid load of 99.5 +/- 0.8%w/w, disintegration and dissolution times of 17.6 +/- 0.9 s and 5.5 +/- 0.1 min respectively. In vitro crystallinity, thermal measurements and in silico thermodynamic predictions confirmed the strip's intrinsic miscibility, thermodynamic stability and amorphous nature. A Korsmeyer-Peppas (r = 0.99; n > 1 = 1.07) fitted kinetics typified by an initial burst release of 49.4 +/- 1.9% at 4 min and a total of 99.8 +/- 3.3% at 30 min was noted. Ex vivo isoniazid permeation through porcine buccal mucosa was bi-phasic and characterized by a 50.4 +/- 3.8% surge and 95.6 +/- 2.9% at 5 and 120 min respectively.

ID IMPACT
AB The present paper reports the first dynamic image analysis-based feedback control of continuous twin-screw wet granulation process. Granulation of the blend of lactose and starch was selected as a model process. The size and size distribution of the obtained particles were successfully monitored by a process camera coupled with an image analysis software developed by the authors. The validation of the developed system showed that the particle size analysis tool can determine the size of the granules with an error of less than 5 mu m. The next step was to implement real-time feedback control of the process by controlling the liquid feeding rate of the pump through a PC, based on the real-time determined particle size results. After the establishment of the feedback control, the system could correct different real-life disturbances, creating a Process Analytically Controlled Technology (PACT), which guarantees the real-time monitoring and controlling of the quality of the granules. In the event of changes or bad tendencies in the particle size, the system can automatically compensate the effect of disturbances, ensuring proper product quality. This kind of quality assurance approach is especially important in the case of continuous pharmaceutical technologies.

AB Leishmaniases are infectious diseases caused by an intracellular protozoan in humans by 20 different species of Leishmania among more than 53 species. There are at least twelve million cases of infections worldwide and three hundred and fifty million people are at risk in at least 98 developing countries in Africa, South-East Asia, and the Americas. Only Brazil presented high burden for both visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and cutaneous (CL). Chemotherapy is the main means of dealing with this infection. Nevertheless, only a few effective drugs are available, and each has a particular disadvantage; toxicity and long-term regimens compromise most chemotherapeutic options, which decreases patient compliance and adherence to the treatment and consequently the emergence of drug-resistant strains. Nano drug delivery systems (NanoDDS) can direct antileishmanial drug substances for intracellular localization in macrophage-rich organs such as bone marrow, liver, and spleen. This strategy can improve the therapeutic efficacy and reduce the toxic effects of several antileishmanial drug substances. This review is an effort to comprehensively compile recent findings, with the aim of advancing understanding of the importance of nanotechnology for treating leishmaniases.

AB The aim of this work was to investigate the correlation of permeation behavior of transdermal formulations through a novel synthetic membrane (Strat-M (R) EMD Millipore, MA) and human cadaver skin. Strat-M (R) membranes were designed with the intent to share similar structural and chemical characteristics found in the human skin however, omitting any biological behavior due to the absence of viable cells. Both human skin and the membrane display a layered structure with a very tight top layer. Additionally, the Strat-M (R) membrane contains a combination of lipids in a specific ratio similar to what is found in the human stratum corneum (SC). Formulations containing nicotine and a chemical penetration enhancer (CPE) were used for evaluating drug penetration to understand how each enhancer impacts the permeability of nicotine as a model compound. The permeability measurements of human cadaver skin and Strat-M (R) membrane were performed with Franz diffusion cell methods accompanied by HPLC analysis. A good correlation of the permeability data was obtained through human cadaver skin and Strat-M (R) membrane. Thus, Strat-M (R) has the potential to be used as a screening tool for evaluating topical/transdermal formulations through the human cadaver skin.

AB Photostability testing of therapeutic proteins is a critical requirement in the development of biologics. Upon exposure to light, pharmaceutical proteins may undergo a change in structure, stability, and functional properties that could have a potential impact on safety and efficacy. In this work, we studied how exposure to light, according to ICH guidelines, leads to photo-oxidation of a therapeutic IgG1 mAb. We also tested the ability of five different excipients to prevent such oxidation. In samples that were exposed to light, we found that the CH2 domain was considerably destabilized but there were no major changes in the overall structure of the protein. Aggregation of the protein was observed because of light exposure. Mass spectrometry identified that light exposure oxidizes two key methionine residues in the Fc region of the protein. In terms of function, a loss in binding to the neonatal Fc receptor, decreased antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and cell proliferation activities of the protein were seen. Combined analysis of the photo-oxidation effects on the structure, stability, aggregation, and function of the mAb has identified the underlying unifying mechanism. Among the sugars and amino acids tested, methionine was the most effective in protecting mAb against photo-oxidation.

AB Insulin, a key peptide hormone that conjointly with its receptor regulates blood glucose levels, is used as the major means to treat diabetes. This therapeutic hormone may undergo different chemical modifications during industrial processes, pharmaceutical formulation, and through its endogenous storage in the pancreatic beta-cells. Insulin is highly sensitive to the environmental stresses and easily undergoes structural changes, being also able to unfold and aggregate. Even small changes altering the structural integrity of insulin may have important impact on the biological efficacy in relation to the physiological and pharmacological activities of this hormone. The chemical modifications of insulin may occur either randomly or based on the well-planned strategies to enhance its pharmaceutical properties. A plethora of studies have attempted to answer the fundamental questions of how chemical modifications and which environmental conditions may have either destructive effects or improve structural stability and pharmaceutical performance of insulin. The aim of this review is to highlight the impact of different modifications on structure, stability, biological activity, and pharmaceutical properties of insulin.

AB Lack of coordination between the beginning of the inhalation and device triggering is one of the most frequent errors reported in connection with the use of pMDI devices. Earlier results suggested a significant loss in lung deposition as a consequence of late actuation. However, most of our knowledge on the effect of poor synchronization is based on earlier works on CFC devices emitting large particles with high initial velocities. The aim of this study was to apply numerical techniques to analyse the effect of late device actuation on the lung dose of a HFA pMDI drug emitting high fraction of extrafine particles used in current asthma and COPD therapy. A computational fluid and particle dynamics model was combined with stochastic whole lung model to quantify the amount of drug depositing in the extrathoracic airways and in the lungs. High speed camera measurements were also performed to characterize the emitted spray plume. Our results have shown that for the studied pMDI drug late actuation leads to reasonable loss in terms of lung dose, unless it happens in the second half of the inhalation period. Device actuation at the middle of the inhalation caused less than 25% lung dose reduction relative to the value characterizing perfect coordination, if the inhalation time was between 2 and 5 s and inhalation flow rate between 30 and 150 L/min. This dose loss is lower than the previously known values of CFC devices and further support the practice of triggering the device shortly after the beginning of the inhalation instead of forcing a perfect synchronization and risking mishandling and poor drug deposition.

AB Delivery of drugs to the lungs via dry powder inhaler (DPI) is a promising approach for the treatment of both local pulmonary conditions and systemic diseases. Though DPIs are widely used for the pulmonary deposition of potent bronchodilators, anticholinergics, and corticosteroids, there is growing interest in the utilization of this delivery system for the administration of high drug doses to the lungs, as made evident by recent regulatory approvals for anti-microbial, anti-viral and osmotic agents. However, the formulation of high dose DPIs carries several challenges from both a physiological and physicochemical standpoint. This review describes the various formulation techniques utilized to overcome the barriers associated with the pulmonary delivery of high dose powders.

AB The pharmaceutical industry is undergoing a significant change in product development and manufacturing strategies with the progressive shift from batch to continuous processes. These typically feature vast volumes of data generated by the numerous sensors connected to several unit operations running over the period of several hours or even days and that demand the application of increasingly efficient tools for process understanding, monitoring and control. This paper describes the use of multivariate statistical process modeling by means of chemometric methods to monitor the continuous wet granulation tableting process for a drug product currently under development. Models are tailored to the different units that make up the continuous tableting line, from material feeding and granulation up to tablet compression, where the solutions devised reflect the different dynamics of each unit and are used as maintenance and intervention tools to optimise manufacturing and associated operations retrospectively as well as in real-time, as part of the product industrialisation programme.

AB Recently we have established a novel approach to produce bioengineered noncoding RNA agents (BERAs) in living cells that carry target RNAi molecules (e.g., siRNA and miRNA) and thus act as "prodrugs". Using GFP-siRNA-loaded BERA (BERA/GFP-siRNA) as a model molecule, this study was to define the in vitro and in vivo knockdown efficiency of BERAs delivered by liposome-polyethylenimine nanocomplex (lipopolyplex or LPP). Compared to in vivo-jetPEI (R) (IVJ-PEI) and polyplex formulations, LPP offered greater protection of BERA/GFP-siRNA against degradation by serum RNases. Particle sizes and zeta potentials of LPP nanocomplex remained stable over 28 days when stored at 4 degrees C. Furthermore, comparable levels of BERA/GFP-siRNA were delivered by LPP and IVJ-PEI to luciferase/GFP-expressing human SK-Hepl-Luc-GFP or A549-Luc-GFP cells, which were selectively processed into target GFP-siRNA and subsequently knocked down GFP mRNA and protein levels. In addition, LPP-carried BERA/GFP-siRNA was successfully delivered into xenograft tumors and offered more consistent knockdown of tumoral GFP mRNA level in an orthotopic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) SK-HeplLuc-GFP xenograft mouse model, while IVJ-PEI formulation showed larger variation. These findings demonstrated that lipidation of polyplexes improved serum stability of biologic RNAi molecules, which was efficiently delivered to orthotopic HCC tissues to knock down target gene expression.

AB Virus infections cause diseases of different severity ranged from mild infection e.g. common cold into life threatening diseases e.g. Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Hepatitis B. Virus infections represent 44% of newly emerging infections. Although there are many efficient antiviral agents, they still have drawbacks due to accumulation at off target organs and developing of virus resistance due to virus mutation. Therefore, developing a delivery system that can selectively target drug into affected organs and avoid off target accumulation would be a highly advantageous strategy to improve antiviral therapy. Nanoparticles (NP) can be effectively targeted to the liver, and therefore it could be used for improving therapy of hepatic virus infections including hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus (HCV). Many studies were performed to encapsulate antiviral agents into nano-delivery system to improve their pharmacokinetics parameters to have a better therapeutic efficacy with lower side effects. However, the effect of virus infection on the uptake of NP has not yet been studied in detail. The latter is a crucial area as modulation of endocytic uptake of nanoparticles could impact on reduce potential therapeutic usefulness of antiviral agents loaded into nano-delivery system. In this study, a fluorescently-labelled polymeric nanoparticle was prepared and used to track NP uptake into Huh7.5, human hepatoma cells transfected with replicating HCV genomes, compared with non-transfected cells as a model representing hepatocyte uptake. Confocal microscopy and flow cytometry of virus transfected Huh7.5 cells unexpectedly demonstrated two-fold increase in uptake of NP compared to non-transfected cells. Therefore, virus transfection enhanced NP uptake into Huh7.5 cells and NP could be considered as a promising delivery system for targeted treatment of hepatitis viruses.

AB The quantification of lipids and assessment of lipid composition is an indispensable step during the pharmaceutical development of novel lipid based drug delivery systems such as liposomes. Broad excipient screenings of such formulations raise the need for versatile analytical methods. Even more demanding complexity is generated by introduction of targeted systems requiring functionalized lipids. We addressed this demand by developing an rp-HPLC based analytical method with evaporative light scattering detection (ELSD) for the simultaneous analysis of commonly used phosphatidylcholines, cholesterol and bilayer surface-modifying cationic, anionic or PEGylated lipids, which can be analyzed in combination with novel pentaglycine lipids suitable as targeting ligand anchor. The method was validated for specificity, precision, accuracy and sample stability. We monitor the continuous and scalable manufacturing of two pentaglycine-modified liposomal formulations and track the modification of these drug delivery systems with a single-domain antibody utilizing bioorthogonal Sortase-A technology. Both the presented analytical and preparative techniques can help to improve the quality control and to accelerate the pharmaceutical development of such targeted drug delivery systems.

AB Tumor-targeted therapy is an attractive strategy for cancer treatment. Peptide hormone thymosin alpha 1 (T alpha 1) has been used against several diseases, including cancer, but its activity is pleiotropic. Herein, we designed a fusion protein T alpha 1-iRGD by introducing the tumor homing peptide iRGD to T alpha 1. Results show that T alpha 1-iRGD can promote T-cell activation and CD86 expression, thereby exerting better effect and stronger inhibitory against melanoma and lung cancer, respectively, than T alpha 1 in vivo. These effects are indicated by the reduced densities of tumor vessels and T alpha 1-iRGD accumulation in tumors. Moreover, compared with T alpha 1, T alpha 1-iRGD can attach more B16F10 and H460 cells and exhibits significantly better immunomodulatory activity in immunosuppression models induced by hydrocortisone. Circular dichroism spectroscopy and structural analysis results revealed that T alpha 1 and T alpha 1-iRGD both adopted a helical confirmation in the presence of trifluoroethanol, indicating the structural basis of their functions. These findings highlight the vital function of T alpha 1-iRGD in tumor-targeted therapy and suggest that T alpha 1-iRGD is a better antitumor drug than T alpha 1.

AB Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is a systemic mycosis endemic in Latin America, caused by Paracoccidioides spp. A limited number of antifungal agents are available and the search for new compounds has increased. Additionally, nanostructured lipid system (NLS) has emmerged as an interesting strategy to carrier compounds for the treatment of mycosis. In this work, the antifungal efficacy and toxicity of dodecyl gallate (DOD) associated with a NLS was evaluated through in vitro and in vivo tests. DOD showed good in vitro antifungal activity and low toxicity in lung fibroblasts and zebrafish embryos, but no antifungal efficacy in infected mice, which may have been a result of low bioavailability. On the other hand, the association of DOD + NLS was beneficial and resulted in lower toxicity in lung fibroblasts and zebrafish embryos. In addition, NLS + DOD promoted a significant reduction in the fungal burden of mice lungs and could be a potential therapeutic option against PCM.

Here, a series of amino acid based gelators were synthesized to explore the role of the gelator structure on functional properties, with the aim of establishing a connection between the molecular parameters and gel properties. By varying the three substitutions of the gelator backbone, it was found that a comprehensive interaction, consisting of hydrophobic forces, H-bonding interactions, conformational flexibility and steric repulsion, play a crucial role in determining the gelation properties. Hansen solubility parameters were employed to explore the solvent effect on the network forming and gel properties. From an analysis of the morphologies obtained from polarized optical microscope (POM), atomic force microscopic images (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the gelator structure was found to have an impact on the self-assembly. According to the X-ray diffraction (XRD), the possible conformations adopted by the gelators were revealed through molecular modelling. The ability to form intermolecular H-bonding is vital in molecular packing and, thus, gelation. A structure-property relationship was developed and proposed to provide a theoretical basis for controllable drug delivery implants.

AB Adjuvant is a substance added to vaccine to improve the immunogenicity of antigens, and it can induce stronger immune responses and reduce the dosage and production cost of vaccine in populations responding poorly to vaccination. Adjuvants in development or in use mainly include aluminum salts, oil emulsions, saponins, immune-stimulating complexes, liposomes, microparticles, nonionic block copolymers, polysaccharides, cytokines and bacterial derivatives. Polysaccharide adjuvants have attracted much attention in the preparation of nano vaccines and nano drugs because natural polysaccharides have the characteristics of intrinsic immunomodulating, biocompatibility, biodegradability, low toxicity and safety. Moreover, it has been proved that a variety of natural polysaccharides possess better immune promoting effects, and they can enhance the effects of humoral, cellular and mucosal immunities. In the present study, we systematically reviewed the recent studies on polysaccharides with vaccine adjuvant activities, including chitosan-based nanoparticles (NPs), glucan, mannose, inulin polysaccharide and Chinese medicinal herb polysaccharide. The application and future perspectives of polysaccharides as adjuvants were also discussed. These findings lay a foundation for the further development of polysaccharide adjuvants. Collectively, more and more polysaccharide adjuvants will be developed and widely used in clinical practice with more in-depth investigations of polysaccharide adjuvants. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB beta-glucans, a group of polysaccharides exist in many organism species such as mushrooms, yeasts, oats, barley, seaweed, but not mammalians, have a variety of biological activities and applications in drugs and other healthcare products. In recent years, beta-glucans have been studied as adjuvants in anti infection vaccines as well as immunomodulators in anti-cancer immunotherapy. beta-glucans can regulate immune responses when administered alone and can connect innate and adaptive immunity to improve immunogenicity of vaccines. When beta-glucans act as immunostimulants or adjuvants, a set of receptors have been revealed to recognize beta-glucans, including dectin-1, complement receptor 3 (CR3), CD5, lactosylceramide, and so on. Therefore, this review is mainly focused on the application of beta-glucans as immune adjuvants, the receptors of beta-glucans, as well as their structure and activity relationship which will benefit future research of beta-glucans.

AB We aimed to characterize the lineages of influenza B viruses obtained from clinical specimens during the 2007-2014 seasons in South Korea. RT-PCR for the partial hemagglutinin gene of influenza B virus was performed on laboratory-confirmed influenza B samples from the 2007-2008 season to 2013-2014 season. A phylogenetic tree was generated, and current influenza vaccine strains for the Northern Hemisphere were used as representative strains of Victoria and Yamagata lineages.
   A total of 571 influenza B virus sequences were analyzed. During the 2009-2010 season, most of the circulating influenza B viruses matched the vaccine strain; 91.0% (91/100) of viruses belonged to the Victoria lineage. In the 2007-2008, 2011-2012, and 2013-2014 seasons, co-circulation of each influenza B lineage was found with a match ratio to the vaccine strain of 53.2% (42/79), 40.9% (63/154), and 58.3% (134/230), respectively. Overall, 41.7% (238/571) of the circulating influenza B viruses belonged to the lineage mismatching the vaccine strain.
   During the seven influenza seasons, influenza B epidemics were substantial in four seasons in South Korea. Significant mismatches of the vaccine and lineage of the circulating influenza B viruses were found. The current trivalent influenza vaccine may not be fully suitable for effective protection against influenza B. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by measles virus. We estimate SSPE age-specific mortality in the United States, 1979-2016. The general decline in SSPE mortality reflects that of measles. Shifts, over time, in SSPE mortality by age echo changes in the age distribution of measles in the 1970s and in the 1989-91 outbreak. The current epidemiological situation is that autochthonous SSPE will disappear in the United States, assuming measles vaccination rates remain high. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: The present study assessed the prevalence and characteristics of S. pneumoniae serotype 19A isolates from children with pneumococcal disease (PD), before and since introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) in Greece.
   Methods: S. pneumoniae isolates collected at one large pediatric hospital between 1986 and 2015 were serotyped by the Quellung reaction and MICs determined by Etest. Alterations of pbp genes and the presence of mefA, mefE, ermB genes were detected by polymerase chain reaction. Genotypes were assessed by multilocus sequence typing (MLST).
   Results: Among 1875 isolates, 210 (11.2%) belonged to serotype 19A. The prevalence of PD caused by serotype 19A increased from 4.6% in the pre-PCV7 years (1986-2005) to 19.6% in the post-PCV7 years (2006-2010), peaking at 27% in 2009 (p < 0.001, 95% CI; 2.0, 18.2) with a significant upward trend (p = 0.04, 95% CI; 1.02, 12.66). Following the introduction of PCV13 in 2010, the rate decreased from 22% in 2011 to 11.4% in 2015 (p = 0.08, 95% CI; 0.92, 5.1) with a downward trend of borderline significance (p = 0.05, 95% CI; -6.8, 0.04). The multidrug resistant (MDR) serotype 19A isolates increased from 10.6% in 1986-2005 to 21.2% in 2006-2010 and to 71.8% in 2011-2015 (P < 0.001). Alterations in pbp genes were detected in all penicillin non-susceptible isolates. Of 110 erythromycin resistant isolates, 21 contained the mefE gene, 36 the ermB and 53 both the mefE and ermB genes. MLST analysis of 142 isolates revealed four dominant clonal complexes (CC); CC320, CC172, CC276 and CC199. The majority of CC320 and CC276 isolates displayed MDR phenotypes.
   Conclusion: PD caused by serotype 19A increased significantly after the introduction of PCV7 followed by a decline after PCV13 use. The vast majority of persisting 19A isolates was MDR. Surveillance studies are necessary to monitor the changes in the pneumococcal population. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction/Background: Inequalities in measles immunization coverage facilitate the onset of outbreaks. This study aimed to quantify socioeconomic inequalities associated with measles immunization coverage at the population level.
   Methods: An ecological study was performed using two datasets: the results of a measles immunization survey performed in Ecuador, in 2011, and socioeconomic data from the 2010 census, aggregated by canton. The survey included 3,140,799 people aged 6 months to 14 years living in 220 cantons of Ecuador. Vaccinated children were considered those who received at least one dose of vaccine against measles. Multiple spatial regression was performed to identify socioeconomic inequalities associated with measles immunization coverage. The slope index of inequality and the relative index of inequality were calculated.
   Results: Vaccination coverage against measles was inversely associated with unsatisfied basic needs in urban areas (P < 0.01) and the proportions of indigenous and African-Ecuadorian residents in the canton (P = 0.015), and directly associated with unemployment rate in the canton (P= 0.037). The distribution of immunization coverage across the cantons was heterogeneous, indicating spatial dependence. The non-immunization rate was 71% higher in the poorer cantons than in the upper stratum cantons (prevalence ratio 1.71; 95%CI: 1.69-1.72). A difference of 10.6 percentage points was detected in immunization coverage between cantons with the best vs. worst socioeconomic level, according to the slope index of inequality. The relative index of inequality revealed that immunization coverage was 1.12 times higher in cantons with the highest socioeconomic level vs. cantons with the lowest socioeconomic level.
   Conclusions: The spatial dependence between measles vaccination coverage and socioeconomic disparities suggests clusters of vulnerable populations for outbreaks. Health and social inequalities must be considered to achieve and maintain measles elimination. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB For nearly two decades, immunization against the beta-amyloid peptide (A beta) has been investigated as a potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Despite some disappointing results in clinic trials, greater significance has been attached by some researchers to exploring the immune effects on pathological and cognitive changes in AD or producing new vaccines of AD. In the previous study, we have made a virus-like particles (A beta-HBc VLPs) as A beta vaccine candidate. A beta-HBc VLPs could ameliorate the learning and memory abilities and reduce cerebral A beta deposit in the old PDAPP mice. In the present study, to observe the preventive effect and the proper time of immunization, 3, 6 and 9-month old PDAPP mice were immunized with A beta-HBc VLPs for 3 months. All mice generated high titer of anti-A beta antibody after A beta-HBc VLPs immunizations. When the mice were 15-month old, Morris Water Maze was used to test their learning and memory abilities. The escape latencies of A beta-HBc VLPs immunized mice were shorter than that of control mice. These immunized mice entered platform region frequently and spent more time on the platform region and quadrant. 3 m and 6 m A beta-HBc VLPs immunized groups performed better than the 9 m group. In immunohistochemistry tests, all the A beta-HBc VLPs immunized mice had less amyloid deposit in cortex and hippocampus. ELISA results showed that soluble A beta was reduced in the brain homogenates of the A beta-HBc VI-Ps immunized mice, and 3- and 6-month groups had less soluble A beta than the 9-month group. In conclusion, our study showed that A beta-HBc VLPs immunization could elicit a strong immune response in adult APP mice, and early immunization had better effects on preventing learning and memory deficits, lowering A beta burden in PDAPP mice.

AB Annual influenza vaccination is recommended to people with chronic conditions. This study aimed to estimate the proportion of chronically ill adults vaccinated against influenza in consecutive seasons and to identify associated factors.
   We used data from the first National Health Examination Survey (INSEF), a cross-sectional study conducted in 2015 on a probabilistic sample of individuals aged 25-74 years. The population was restricted to individuals who self-reported diabetes, a respiratory, cardiovascular, liver or kidney disease. Self-reported vaccination in 4 consecutive seasons was categorized in 3 levels: unvaccinated, occasionally (vaccinated 1-3 seasons) and repeatedly vaccinated (in all 4 seasons). A multinomial logistic regression was applied to estimate odds-ratio (OR) of influenza vaccination according to sociodemographic factors, chronic condition, health care use and status.
   In the target population, the 2014/15 influenza vaccine coverage was 33.8% (95% CI: 29.8-38.1). The higher coverage was found in individuals reporting renal disease (66.7%) and diabetes (43.8%). The coverage decreased to 32.6%, 26.0% and 20.8% for individuals with respiratory, cardiovascular and liver diseases, respectively. The probability of being repeatedly vaccinated, compared to unvaccinated, was higher in males (OR = 2.14: 95% CI: 1.31-3.52); aged 65 and 74 (OR = 4.39; 95% CI: 1.99-9.69); whom had an appointment with a general practitioner (OR = 2.77; 95% CI: 1.00-7.66) or other physician (OR = 3.95: 95% CI: 2.53-6.16); with no smoking habits (OR =1.58; 95% I: 1.02-2.46) and reporting diabetes (OR = 2.13; 95% CI: 1.02-4.45). Finally, having a self-reported cardiovascular condition decreased the likelihood of being occasionally (OR = 0.38; 95% CI = 0.22-0.65) vaccinated against influenza.
   Younger individuals, females and the ones with a self-reported cardiovascular condition were identified as more likely of non-compliance to the vaccine uptake recommendation. Future vaccination strategies should focus on the previous identified population subgroups. Also, the medical recommendation of the influenza vaccine uptake should continue and be reinforced particularly in individuals with a cardiovascular condition. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Despite safe and effective childhood immunizations, decreased acceptance of vaccines has become an emerging global problem. The WHO SAGE Working Group on Vaccine Hesitancy developed a common diagnostic tool, the Vaccine Hesitancy Scale (VHS), to identify and compare hesitancy in different global settings. We field tested the VHS in rural and urban Guatemala.
   Methods: We analyzed data from the enrollment visit of a study conducted at four public health clinics in Guatemala. Infants ages 6 weeks-6 months presenting for their first wellness visit were enrolled March-November 2016. Parents completed a demographic survey that included the 10 dichotomous and 10 Likert scale VHS questions. Chi-square or Fisher's exact for categorical and ANOVA test for continuous variables were used to assess significance levels in survey differences. We conducted a factor analysis to assess the Likert scale questions.
   Results: Of 1088 families screened, 871 were eligible and 720 (82.7%) participated. No parent had ever refused a vaccination, and only eight parents (1.1%) had been reluctant or hesitated to get a vaccination for their children. However, only 40.8% (n = 294) of parents said that they think most parents like them have their children vaccinated with all the recommended vaccines. Factor analysis identified two underlying constructs that had eigenvalues of 1.0 or greater and a substantive lack of variability in response across the Likert scale. There were consistent differences between how study clinics responded to the ordinal scaling.
   Conclusion: Our results suggest problems with interpretation of the VHS, especially in the presence of vaccine shortages and using a Likert scale that does not resonate across diverse cultural settings. Our factor analysis suggests that the Likert scale items are more one-dimensional and do not represent the multiple constructs of vaccine hesitancy. We suggest more work is needed to refine this survey for improved reliability and validity. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Targeted vaccination strategies are necessary to prevent people who use drugs (PWUD) becoming infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV). The aims of this study were to provide an overview of the activities for PWUD in a decentralised vaccination program in the Netherlands and to explore the determinants associated with completing a standard hepatitis B vaccination series.
   Methods: We used data for behavioural risk groups from the register of the national vaccination program. The data concerned PWUD who were immunised against hepatitis B in the Netherlands between 2002 and 2011. A standard series of three vaccinations (at 0, 1, and 6 months) was offered at inclusion and was continued if serological markers for past or chronic HBV infection were absent. Completion of a vaccination series (at least three vaccinations, irrespective of timing) was a dependent variable in our logistic regression analysis.
   Results: The program reached 18,054 PWUD. Of the 15,746 participants eligible for vaccination (i.e. they were neither carriers of hepatitis B nor immune to hepatitis B), 9089 (58%) completed a series of three hepatitis B vaccinations. Factors associated with a higher completion rate of a vaccination series (p < 0.01) were: starting vaccination in the earlier years of the program, older age of PWUD, intravenous drug use, vaccine administration by addiction care centres, and flexibility in location of vaccine delivery.
   Conclusion: Despite using a standard HBV vaccination schedule and no financial incentives, vaccination completion among PWUD was relatively high. Our results suggest that flexibility of vaccination location and administration of vaccines by healthcare workers with sustainable contact with PWUD could improve vaccination programs for this risk group.

TI Reasons for non-vaccination and incomplete vaccinations among children

DE Reasons; Non-vaccination; Incomplete vaccination; Vaccine refusal
ID BARRIERS
AB Background: Global immunization efforts have received a boost through the introduction of several new vaccines. These efforts however, are threatened by sub-optimal vaccine coverage, particularly in countries with large birth cohorts. Pakistan has one of the largest birth cohorts in the world, where coverage of routine vaccination remains persistently inadequate. We undertook this study to ascertain reasons for non-vaccination or incomplete vaccination of children less than two years in 8 districts of southern Pakistan.
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey using WHO recommended rapid coverage assessment technique was conducted in 2014. Using probability proportional to size method, we sampled 8400 households with eligible children (aged 4-12 months). Using a structured questionnaire, mothers or other primary caregivers were interviewed to determine vaccination status of an index child. In case of non-vaccination or incomplete vaccination, respondents were asked for reasons leading to low/no vaccine uptake.
   Results: Based on both vaccination record and recall, only 30.8% of children were fully vaccinated, 46% had an incomplete vaccination status while 23%were non-vaccinated. The most frequently reported reasons for non-vaccination included: mothers caregivers being unaware of the need for vaccination (35.3%), a fear of side effects (23%), mother/caregiver being too busy (16.6%), distance from vaccination centers (13.8%), and non-availability of either vaccinators or vaccines at vaccination centers (10.7%). Reasons identified for incomplete vaccination were similar, with caregivers being unaware of the need for subsequent doses (27.3%), non-availability of vaccinators or vaccines (17.7%), mother/caregiver being too busy (14.8%), fear of side effects (11.2%), and postponement for another time (8.7%).
   Conclusion: Various factors result in non-compliance with vaccination schedules and vaccine refusal within the surveyed communities, ranging from lack of knowledge to non-availability of supplies at vaccination centers. These barriers are best addressed through multi-pronged strategies addressing supply gaps, increasing community awareness and enhancing demand for routine vaccination services. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In the UK, it is recommended that pregnant women receive the influenza and pertussis vaccination. However, uptake of these vaccinations in certain UK regions remains low. Previous studies show that pregnant women use the internet to access health information, yet it has not been previously explored whether the use of social networking sites (SNS) influences decisions about maternal vaccination uptake.
   The aim of this study was to determine, if the use of SNS to gain information on pregnancy vaccinations, is associated with women's uptake of the influenza and pertussis vaccines during pregnancy.
   This is a cross-sectional study with data collected using an online questionnaire posted on Mumsnet (an online parenting site), from 3rd to 24th August 2017. Women were included if they lived in the UK, were over 32 weeks pregnant, or had given birth in the last year. Participants were questioned about their pregnancy vaccination uptake, general SNS use and, their SNS use in relation to gathering information on vaccinations during pregnancy. The data was analysed using chi-square test, and univariable and multivariable logistic regression.
   Out of a sample of 308 participants, 305 (99.3%) of women reported using SNS and 64/308 (20.8%) of women reported using SNS to gather information on vaccinations during pregnancy.
   Women who reported using SNS to gather information on pregnancy vaccinations were 58% (adjusted odds ratio 0.42; 95% CI 0.21-0.87) less likely to receive the pertussis vaccination during pregnancy. However, the association was not statistically significant for the influenza vaccination (adjusted odds ratio 0.64; 95% CI 0.37-1.11).
   The study showed many women use SNS to gather information on pregnancy vaccinations, and this is negatively associated with their likelihood of receiving the pertussis vaccine. Future studies are needed to analyse the accuracy and quality of the vaccination information, which women find on SNS. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Neisseria meningitidis serogroups A, B, C, W and Y cause most meningococcal disease worldwide. An investigational MenABCWY vaccine combining serogroup B antigens and a meningococcal ACWY CRM197-glycoconjugate vaccine (MenACWY-CRM) could provide protection against all 5 serogroups. Complement mediated bactericidal activity induced by MenABCWY was tested against a panel of 110 randomly-selected serogroup B strains causing invasive disease in the US to evaluate the vaccine's breadth of coverage (BoC).
   Methods: We conducted this observer-blind study (NCT02140762) and its extension (NCT02285777) in 8 centers in the US. Adolescents aged 10-18 years were randomized (1:1) to receive either 3 MenABCWY doses (MenABCWY group), on a 0, 2, 6-month (M) schedule or a single MenACWY-CRM dose at M2 and placebo at 0,6-M (Control group). MenABCWY BoC was calculated as (1 - relative risk) x 100 (relative risk = ratio between the percentage of samples seronegative at 1:4 dilution against the selected strains in the MenABCWY vs Control group). BoC was determined at 1 M and 4 M after 2 and 3 doses, using an endogenous complement serum bactericidal assay. Immunogenicity and safety were assessed.
   Results: 301 and 189 adolescents were vaccinated in the parent and extension study, respectively. At 1 M post-vaccination, the BoC of MenABCWY across the 110 serogroup B strains was 67% (95%Cl: 65-69) after 2 doses and 71% (95%Cl: 69-73) after 3 doses. BoC decreased to 44% (95%Cl: 41-47) and 51% (95%Cl: 48-55) at 4 M after 2 and 3 MenABCWY doses, respectively. Robust immune responses to antigen-specific test strains for each serogroup were observed at all timepoints in the MenABCWY group. No reactogenicity or safety concerns arose during the study.
   Conclusion: Two or 3 doses of MenABCWY showed similar BoC against the panel of invasive US serogroup B isolates and comparable immunogenicity against the antigen-specific test strains, with no safety concerns identified. (C) 2018 GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals SA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study aimed to investigate the chemokine CCL20, a macrophage inflammatory protein-3 alpha, for adjuvant potential in inactivated foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) vaccine. Groups of mice were injected intramuscularly with either murine CCL20 DNA or CCL20 protein two days ahead of the immunization with Montanide ISA206 adjuvanted inactivated FMD vaccine and humoral and cellular immune responses were measured in post-vaccinal sera. We demonstrated that the mice immunized with CCL20 plasmid plus FMD vaccine showed earlier and significantly (p < 0.05) higher neutralizing antibody responses compared to the mice vaccinated with CCL20 protein plus FMD vaccine. In fact, CCL20 as a protein did not show any adjuvant effect and the immune responses induced in this group were comparable to that of the mice vaccinated with FMD vaccine alone. All the vaccination groups showed serum IgG1 and IgG2 antibody responses; however, the mice vaccinated with CCL20 plasmid plus FMD vaccine showed significantly (p < 0.05) higher IgG1 and IgG2 responses and the responses remained high at all-time points post vaccination, although not always statistically significant. Upon restimulation of the vaccinated splenocytes with the inactivated FMD viral antigen, significantly (p < 0.05) higher IFN-gamma and lL-2 levels in culture supernatants were found in animals vaccinated with the CCL20 plasmid plus FMD vaccine, which is indicative of the T(H)1 type of cellular immunity. On challenge with the homologous FMD virus on 28th day post immunization, CCL20 plasmid plus FMD vaccine showed complete protection (100%) while animals immunized with CCL20 protein plus FMD vaccine or FMD vaccine alone showed 66% protection. In summary, we show that prior injection of CCL20 plasmid improved protective efficacy of the inactivated FMD vaccine and thus offers a valuable strategy to modulate the efficacy and polarization of specific immunity against inactivated vaccines.

AB During the height of the 2009 H1N1 swine-derived influenza pandemic, a clinical trial was conducted in which seven subjects were immunized using a monovalent, MF5 (R)-adjuvanted vaccine, developed from an egg-passaged candidate vaccine virus (CVV), A/California/07/2009 X-181. Whole blood was collected prior to immunization and at 8, 22, and 202 days post-vaccination, and subjects' serological responses were evaluated. Here, we reconstruct and examine the longitudinal, influenza-specific circulating B cell repertoire of one subject in that study. Genotypic analysis of 390 total subject-derived antibodies (Abs) revealed a total of 29 germline genes in use among immunoglobulin heavy chain variable regions (IgHV), with the majority of those sequences isolated representing memory recall responses and two major lineages dominating the early response. In vitro phenotyping showed a diverse set of binding epitopes on the surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), many of which are considered subdominant. Strong correlations were found between IgHV germline usage among non-related lineages and both binding epitope and neutralization breadth. Results here highlight the potential for Ab responses to be misdirected to egg-adaptive artifacts on CVVs while simultaneously stressing the ability to mount potent, broadly neutralizing responses to mostly novel antigens via recall of subdominant memory responses, as well as the need for evaluating alternative endpoint assays and anti-NA responses following clinical trials.

AB Introduction: Adult vaccination coverage rates in the US are well below national targets, leaving many adults at increased risk. Additionally, typical vaccination coverage calculations do not adequately approximate population immunity as they do not consider whether multidose vaccines were administered within the recommended schedules. As timely administration of each dose optimizes overall vaccine effectiveness, we sought to document adherence to and completion of the hepatitis A (HepA), hepatitis B (HepB), and combined hepatitis A and hepatitis B (HepA-HepB) multidose vaccine schedule in an insured adult population in the US.
   Methods: We conducted a retrospective database study of administrative claims from 2008 to 2015 (analyzed in 2017). Completion of 2 (HepA) and 3 doses (HepB and HepA-HepB), and adherence to the 2- and 3-dose recommended schedules were measured among individuals aged 19 years and older at first dose. The proportion of patients who completed 2 and 3 doses and were adherent to the recommended schedule were estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods.
   Results: For HepA, 27.14% of initiating adults were adherent to the recommended schedule, and 32.05% had received a second dose by 42 months. Approximately one-third of adults who initiated the HepB or HepA-HepB series completed all 3 doses within 2 years of the minimum spacing (31.17% and 32.27%, respectively). Generally, completion and adherence were highest in individuals aged 60-64 years at the time of initiation.
   Conclusions: Hepatitis vaccine adherence and completion in adults is suboptimal. As a result, the majority of adults initiating each series may not be receiving the full protective benefit of these multidose vaccines. (C) 2018 Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., and The Authors.

AB Background: In the UK, the childhood immunisation programme is given in the first 5 years of life and protects against 12 vaccine-preventable diseases. Recently, this programme has undergone changes with addition of vaccination against Meningitis B from September 2015 and the removal of the primary dose of protection against Meningitis C from July 2016. These hanges have direct impact on the associated diseases but in addition may induce indirect effects on the vaccines that are given simultaneously or later in the programme. In this work, we developed a novel formal method to evaluate the impact of vaccination changes to one aspect of the programme across an entire vaccine programme.
   Methods: Firstly, we combined transmission modelling (for four diseases) and historic data synthesis (for eight diseases) to project, for each disease, the disease burden at different levels of effective coverage against the associated disease. Secondly, we used a simulation model to determine the vector of effective coverage against each disease under three variations of the current childhood schedule. Combining these, we calculated the vector of disease burden across the programme under different scenarios, and assessed the direct and indirect effects of the schedule changes.
   Results: Through illustrative application of our novel framework to three scenarios of the current childhood immunisation programme in the UK, we demonstrated the feasibility of this unifying approach. For each disease in the programme, we successfully quantified the residual disease burden due to the change. For some diseases, the change was indirectly beneficial and reduced the burden, whereas for others the effect was adverse and the change increased the disease burden.
   Conclusions: Our results demonstrate the potential benefit of considering the programme-wide impact of changes to an immunisation schedule, and our framework is an important step in the development of a means for systematically doing so. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: An increasing number of studies have shown that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in the development of glioma. However, a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the clinical value of lncRNA expression in glioma patients is lacking. We performed this study to assess the relationship between the expression of various lncRNAs and the clinicopathological features, diagnosis and prognosis of glioma.
   Materials and methods: Eligible studies were identified through a comprehensive literature search. We conducted a subgroup analysis to assess the clinicopathological value of urothelial carcinoma associated 1 (UCA1). Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) of lncRNAs for survival were calculated to analyze the prognostic performance of lncRNAs.
   Results: In total, 40 studies, including 30 investigating clinicopathological features, 3 investigating diagnoses and 32 investigating prognoses, were analyzed in this study. UCA1 expression was positively associated with tumor size (odds ratio [OR], 2.09; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-4.15; P < 0.001) and World Health Organization (WHO) grade (OR, 3.84, [95% CI 1.84-8.01], P < 0.001). In the prognostic meta-analysis, high metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) expression could predict poor overall survival (OS) in patients with glioma, with a pooled HR of 2.32 (95% CI: 1.64-3.27, P < 0.001).
   Conclusions: This systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated that lncRNAs are associated with tumor size, WHO grade, and prognosis in glioma patients. lncRNAs could function as potential molecular biomarkers of the clinicopathology and prognosis of glioma.

AB Neurotrophin receptor-interacting melanoma antigen-encoding protein (NRAGE) is a type II melanoma-associated antigen that plays an essential role in various processes, including cell differentiation and apoptosis. NRAGE has been shown to act as a cancer-related protein, with complex and apparently contradictory functions in a variety of cancers. In the current study, we examined the expression of NRAGE protein in 169 gastric cancer samples. NRAGE upregulation was correlated with advanced TNM stage, local invasion, and poor survival. Importantly, NRAGE could serve as an independent prognostic factor in patients with gastric cancer. We also examined the expression of NRAGE protein in GES-1 normal gastric epithelial cells and in six gastric cancer cell lines. Inhibition of NRAGE expression by transfection with small interfering RNA reduced the proliferation and invasion of MGC-803 and HGC-27 cells, as demonstrated by CCK-8 and Matrigel invasion assays. NRAGE depletion also sensitized HGC-27 and MGC-803 cells to cisplatin, as shown by CCK-8 and Annexin V/propidium iodide analyses. Western blot analysis also showed that NRAGE depletion negatively regulated Bcl-2 and p-ERK and upregulated ZO-1 and p27 expression levels. In conclusion, our results suggest that NRAGE acts as a tumor promoter in gastric cancer by facilitating cancer invasion and chemoresistance, possibly through regulation of PERK and Bcl-2.

AB Congenital sideroblastic anemia (CSA) is a series of rare, heterogeneous disorders, characterized by iron overload in the mitochondria of erythroblasts and ringed sideroblasts in bone marrow. In recent years, rapid development of next-generation sequencing technology brings great advance in understanding of genetic and pathophysiologic features of CSA. Based on the pathophysiology of mitochondrial iron metabolism, causative genes of CSA can be divided into three subtypes: heme biosynthesis related; iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis and transportation related; and mitochondrial respiratory chain synthesis related. Patients with CSA present various clinical manifestation due to relevant mutation gene and require different treatment strategies. The recognition of the causative genes and evolution of pathogenicity is critical. In this review, we summarize the recent progress in mutation genes of CSA, and its potential role in the pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment.

AB Scavenger Receptor B1 (SR-B1) is an 82 kDa integral membrane glycoprotein that mediates selective uptake of high-density lipoprotein cholesteryl ester (CE) in vitro and in vivo. Previously, we defined several kinds of regulatory mechanisms of SR-B1 expression and function. Here, we have dissected the function of a novel miR-24 on SR-B1 expression, HDL uptake and lipid metabolism. We showed that miR-24 was upregulated in HepG2 cells cultured in the mimicked hyperlipidemic condition and in the livers of dietary induced and genetic obesity mice. Overexpression of miR-24 inhibited SR-B1 expression by directly targeting SR-B1 3' GTR and repressed HDL uptake and steroidogenesis in steroidogenic cells. HepG2 cells with miR-24 showed attenuation of TG levels and lipid accumulation. Moreover, we validated that overexpression of miR-24 downregulated the expression of certain genes involved in lipogenesis, FASN, ACLY and SCD1, and increased the expression of genes of cholesterol synthesis, HMGCR, DFICR24 and SREBP2. Taken together, we demonstrated that obesity induced miR-24 repressed HDL uptake, steroid hormone synthesis and lipid metabolism by targeting SR-B1.

AB Calpain 3 (Capn3), a skeletal muscle-specific member of the calpain family, executes some non-proteolytic functions besides its role as a Ca2+-tregulated proteolytic enzyme. Previously, we found that changes in Capn3 expression were linearly correlated with the degree of muscular atrophy following reversible sciatic nerve injury and that knockdown of Capn3 gene expression promoted myoblast differentiation. While the regulation of capn3 gene expression is interesting, transcriptional regulation of Capn3 is still unclear. In the present study, we provided experimental data showing that the myogenic enhancer factor 2A (MEF2A) regulated Capn3 gene expression. Firstly, the luciferase reporter assay and EMSA were performed and showed that ectopic expression of the Mef2a gene could bind to the predicted site of the Capn3 promoter region. Furthermore, in the L6 myoblast differentiation model in vitro, Capn3 gene expression was shown to be positively associated with the level of Mef2a by qRT-PCR, western-blotting, and immunocytochemistry. The Capn3 protein level decreased as MEF2A decreased when induced by Mef2a siRNA transfection in L6 myoblasts. Finally, the results of ChIP indicated that MEF2A occupied the promoter region of the Capn3 gene in rat denervated gastrocnemius muscle tissue. Based on these results, we proposed that MEF2A is a transcriptional regulator for Capn3 gene expression.

AB Previous phylogenetic studies have suggested that Rubus takesimensis (Rosaceae), which is endemic to Ulleung Island, Korea, is closely related to R. crataegifolius, which is broadly distributed across East Asia. A recent phylogeographic study also suggested the possible polyphyletic origins of R. takesimensis from multiple source populations of its continental progenitor R. crataegifolius in China, Japan, Korea, and the Russian Far East. However, even though the progenitor-derivative relationship between R. crataegifolius and R. takesimensis has been established, little is known about the chloroplast genome (i.e., plastome) evolution of anagenetically derived species on oceanic islands and their continental progenitor species. In the present study, we characterized the complete plastome of R. takesimensis and compared it to those of R. crataegifolius and four other Rubus species. The R. takesimensis plastome was 155,760 base pairs (bp) long, a total of 46 bp longer than the plastome of R. crataegifolius (28 from LSC and 18 from SSC). No structural or content rearrangements were found between the species pairs. Four highly variable intergenic regions (tp/32/trnL, rps4/trnT, /MIL, and psbZ/trnG) were identified between R. takesimensis and R. crataegifolius. Compared to the plastomes of other congeneric species (R. corchorifolius, R. fockeanus, and R. niveus), six highly variable intergenic regions (ndhC/psaC, rps16/trnQ, tmK/rps16, trnL/trnF, trnM/atpE, and trnQ/psbK) were also identified. A total of 116 simple sequence repeats (SSRs), including 48 mononucleotide, 64 dinucleotide, and four trinucleotide repeat motifs were characterized in R. takesimensis. The plastome resources generated by the present study will help to elucidate plastome evolution within the genus and to resolve phylogenetic relationships within highly complex and reticulated lineages. Phylogenetic analysis supported both the monophyly of Rubus and the sister relationship between R. crataegifolius and R. takesimensis.

The RML conjugated to a hybrid support consisting of biopolymers, chitosan (CS) and chitin nanowhiskers (CNWs). 1-ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl] carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDAC) was used as the crosslinker to bind the lipase. Immobilization of RML was the highest on crosslinked CS/CNWs which gave a protein loading of similar to 8.12 mg/g, corresponding to specific and residual activity of 537 U/g and 137%, respectively. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis-differential thermogravimetry, field emission scanning electron and atomic force microscopy of RMLCS/CNWs revealed that RML was successfully attached to the surface of crosslinked CS/CNWs. Under an optimized condition, the highest yield of eugenyl benzoate (56.3%) was attained after 5 h using 3 mg/mL of RMLCS/CNWs with molar ratio of eugenol: benzoic acid of 3:1, as compared to only 47.3% for the free RML. Analyses of FTIR and NMR on purified eugenyl benzoate affirmed that the ester was successfully produced in the enzymatic esterification. Therefore, the use of the RML-CS/CNWs biocatalysts appears promising to afford good yields of eugenyl benzoate within a relatively shorter reaction time.

AB The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of three routine drug excipients, as osmolytes, in three different concentrations, on structure, thermal stability and the activity of single-chain (sc-) tenecteplase. To see the influence of trehalose, mannitol, and sucrose on the structure, stability and function of sc-tenecteplase, thermal stability, fluorescence, circular dichroism (CD) and enzyme kinetic measurements and molecular docking studies were carried out. To measure the effect of osmolytes on stability of sc-tenecteplase, thermodynamic parameters (transition temperature (T-m), standard enthalpy change (Delta H degrees), standard entropy change (Delta S degrees) and Delta G degrees, the standard Gibbs free energy change, were determined from heat-induced transition curves of the protein in absence and presence of each osmolyte. It was observed that all three osmolytes acted as an enhancer for the sc-tenecteplase stability, with varying efficacies and efficiencies. The results of the kinetic study showed that the activity of sc-tenecteplase is increased in the presence of osmolytes. The near-UV and far-UV CD studies showed transfer of Trp, Phe and Tyr residues to a more flexible environment in the presence of osmolytes. The sc-tenecteplase fluorescence quenching suggested the more polar location of Trp residues. Molecular docking studies revealed that (i) Gibbs free energy of interaction between the osmolyte and sc-tenecteplase is negative, and (ii) hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interactions dominate within the interaction sites.

AB The yeast Rhodosporidium toruloides has been extensively studied for its application in biolipid production. The knowledge of its metabolism capabilities and the application of constraint-based flux analysis methodology provide useful information for process prediction and optimization. The accuracy of the resulting predictions is highly dependent on metabolic models. A metabolic reconstruction for R. toruloides metabolism has been recently published. On the basis of this model, we developed a curated version that unblocks the central nitrogen metabolism and, in addition, completes charge and mass balances in some reactions neglected in the former model. Then, a comprehensive analysis of network capability was performed with the curated model and compared with the published metabolic reconstruction. The flux distribution obtained by lipid optimization with flux balance analysis was able to replicate the internal biochemical changes that lead to lipogenesis in oleaginous microorganisms. These results motivate the development of a genome-scale model for complete elucidation of R. toruloides metabolism.

AB Feruloylated acylglycerols (FAG) can be used as antioxidants and UV absorbing ingredients in food and cosmetics. In this work, FAG was prepared by the lipase-catalyzed transesterification of glyceryl monoferulate (GMF) with different acyl donors using ionic liquids (ILs) as reaction solvents. The effect of different imidazolium ILs (BF4-, PF6- and TF2N-) and acyl donors (monoacylglycerols and diacylglycerols) on the transesterification and lipase selectivity for FAG formation were compared. The effect of reaction parameters (temperature, enzyme concentration, substrates ratio and time) on the reaction were also studied. The results showed that FAG preparation can be enhanced using monoolein (MO) and distearin (DS) as acyl donors. High transesterification activity and excellent lipase selectivity for lipophilic FAG formation were achieved using [C18MIM]PF6 as reaction solvent. The activation energy to form the lipophilic FAG by transesterification using MO as an acyl donor was 37.2 kJ/mol, which was lower than that of DS (92.9 kJ/mol). The activation energy to form the hydrophilic glyceryl diferulate by the esterification of GMF with feruloyl formed by the hydrolysis of another GMF (21.5 kJ/mol) using MO as an acyl donor was lower than that of DS (61.9 kJ/mol).

AB Biosurfactants are amphipathic molecules with relevance in biotechnology due to their structural diversity, low toxicity and biodegradability. The genus Rhodococcus has extensively been studied because of its capacity to produce trehalose-containing surfactants as well as trehalose lipids as potential pathogenic factor. Here we present the draft genome sequence of Rhodococcus erythropolis B7g isolated with toluene from fuel-contaminated soil. The genome comprises 7,175,690 bp in 121 contigs, a G + C content of 62,4% and 7,153 coding DNA sequences (CDSs), and it contains genes for trehalose biosynthesis and surfactant production. Additionally, genes for the production of trehalose-tetraester biosurfactant were identified, whose function was experimentally verified making the strain B7g a potential candidate for use in bioremediation applications or in biosurfactant exploration.

AB Encapsulation of hydrolases in biopolymer-based hydrogels often suffers from low activities and encapsulation efficiencies along with high leaching and unsatisfactory recycling properties. Exemplified for the encapsulation of pig liver esterase the coating of alginate and chitosan beads have been studied by creating various biopolymer hydrogel beads. Enzyme activity and encapsulation efficiency were notably enhanced by chitosan coating of alginate beads while leaching remained nearly unchanged. This was caused by the enzymatic reaction acidifying the matrix, which increased enzyme retention through enhanced electrostatic enzyme-alginate interaction but decreased activity through enzyme deactivation. A practical and ready-to-use method for visualising pH in beads during reaction by co-encapsulation of a conventional pH indicator was also found. Our method proves that pH control inside the beads can only be realised by buffering. The resulting beads provided a specific activity of 0.267 mu mol center dot min(-1) center dot mg(-1), effectiveness factor 0.88, encapsulation efficiency of 88%, 5% leaching and good recycling properties. This work will contribute towards better understanding and application of encapsulated hydrolases for enzymatic syntheses.

AB Adipic acid (AA) is an important dicarboxylic acid used for the manufacture of nylon and polyurethane plastics. In this study, a novel adipic acid biosynthetic pathway was designed by extending the cis,cis-muconic acid (MA) biosynthesis through biohydrogenation. Enoate reductase from Clostridium acetobutylicum (CaER), an oxygen-sensitive reductase, was demonstrated to have in vivo enzyme activity of converting cis, cis-muconic acid to adipic acid under microaerobic condition. Engineered Escherichia coli strains were constructed to express the whole pathway and accumulated 5.8 +/- 0.9 mg/L adipic acid from simple carbon sources. Considering the different oxygen demands between cis, cis-muconic acid biosynthesis and its degradation, a co-culture system was constructed. To improve production, T7 promoter instead of lac promoter was used for higher level expression of the key enzyme CaER and the titer of adipic acid increased to 18.3 +/- 0.6 mg/L. To decrease the oxygen supply to downstream strains expressing CaER, Vitreoscilla hemoglobin (VHb) was introduced to upstream strains for its ability on oxygen obtaining. This attempt further improved the production of this novel pathway and 27.6 +/- 1.3 mg/L adipic acid was accumulated under microaerobic condition.

AB Biomass yields and biofuel production were examined in a dual (solid and liquid)-phase cultivation system (DuPHA) with the unique filamentous cyanobacteria, Pseudanabaena sp. ABRG 5-3 and Limnothrix sp. SK1-2-1. Continuous circular cultivation was driven under the indoor closed (IC) or indoor opened (IO) conditions and provided biomass yields of approximately 8-27 g dry cell weight (DCW) floor m(-2) d(-1). Alkanes of heptadecane (C17H36) or pentadecane (C15H32) as liquid biofuels were also recovered from the lower liquid-phase, in which cyanobacteria were dropped from the upper solid-phase and continuously cultivated with a small amount of medium. After the main cultivation in DuPHA, the upper solid-phase of a cotton cloth on which cyanobacteria grew was dried and directly subjected to a combustion test. This resulted in the thermal power (kJ s(-1)) of the cloth with microalgae increasing approximately 20-50% higher than that of the cloth only, suggesting a possibility of using the solid phase with microalgae as solid biofuel.

AB Mixed microbial cultures (MMCs) are an effective method for polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) production. There are several models established to describe the metabolism of this process. Substrate competition was commonly found in the uptake of multiple volatile fatty acids (VFAs), thus this behavior should be considered in process modeling. In this study, a metabolic model is developed to describe for the first time the substrate competition among four commonly used VFAs (acetate, propionate, butyrate and valerate) in PHA production by MMCs. An inhibition parameter was introduced to describe the inhibition of butyrate and valerate on the uptake of acetate and propionate. The modeled results showed good agreement with experimental data within 95% confidence interval. This model enhanced the understanding of the metabolism of substrate uptake in PHA production, providing a successful approach to predict PHA composition and optimize the process efficiency when four competing VFAs are supplied.

AB Obesity due to excessive lipid accumulation is closely associated with metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance and inflammation. Therefore, a detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie adipogenesis is crucial to develop treatments for diseases related to obesity. Here, we found that the microRNA-204-5p (miR-204-5p) was expressed at low levels in fat tissues from obese mice fed long-term with a high-fat diet (HFD). Overexpression or inhibition of miR-204-5p in vitro in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes significantly inhibited or promoted 3T3-L1 proliferation, respectively, an effect mediated by regulating cell proliferation factors. miR-204-5p also induced preadipocyte apoptosis by directly targeting the 3' UTR region of Bc1-2, reducing the constitutive suppression of Bc1-2 on p53-dependent apoptosis. Interestingly, overexpression of miR-204-5p during adipocyte differentiation significantly increased the number of oil red 0 + cells, triglyceride accumulation and the expression of markers associated with adipocyte differentiation. In contrast, inhibition of miR-204-5p had the opposite effect on 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation. Luciferase activity assays and qRT-PCR showed that miR-204-5p regulates adipocyte differentiation by negatively regulating KLF3, a negative regulator of lipogenesis. Taken together, our findings showed that miR-204-5p inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis of preadipocytes by regulating Bc1-2, but also promotes adipocyte differentiation by targeting KLF3.

AB The importance of apolipoprotein E genotypes and allelic polymorphisms in the etiology of recurrent miscarriage is controversial. We plan to investigate this in a two-group study involving more than a thousand participants. In total, 1046 subjects (802 participants in the first group, 244 participants in the second group) were investigated. Women in the first group had a history of >= 3 consecutive spontaneous miscarriage and women in the second group had at most one miscarriage in three consecutive pregnancies. The participants with the following evidence and symptoms were excluded from both groups; structural uterine abnormality, chrosomal abnormalities and polymorphisms, hormonal imbalance, anti-nuclear antibodies, anti-phospholipid antibodies, lupus anticoagulant and homozygous genotype for FV-Leiden, MTHFR C677T, MTHFR A1298C, prothrombin 20210G > A and plasminogen activator inhibitor 4G/5G polymorphisms. We found similar apolipoprotein E allelic frequencies and genotype distributions in both groups. The frequencies of epsilon 2 alleles were 4.1% in the first group and 2.9% in the second group, whereas those of epsilon 3 alleles were 90.8% and 93% in the first group and the second group, respectively and epsilon 4 alleles were 5.1% in the first group and 4.1% in the second group. The genotypes of Apo E observed in the first and the second group respectively were as follows; epsilon 2/epsilon 3 (7.5% and 5.7%), epsilon 3/epsilon 3 (82.7% and 86.5%), epsilon 3/epsilon 4 (8.7% and 7.4%), epsilon 4/epsilon 4 (0.5% and 0.4%) and epsilon 2/epsilon 4 (0.6% and 0). Our data did not support a possible association between apolipoprotein E genotypes and allelic frequencies, and recurrent miscarriages. We believe that the studies excluding the etiological factors that were previously found to be related with any condition are more valuable in the scope of showing the cause-effect relationship.

AB Oncogenes are mutated form of normal cellular genes called as proto-oncogenes and conduce to the cancer development process. Despite the fact that so many genes have been described, new genes with oncogenic characteristic and potential or tumor supressoring activity are still being defined. Recently, Up-regulated gene 4/Upregulator of cell proliferation (URG4/URGCP), a novel gene, induced by hepatitis-Bvirus-encoded X antigen (HBxAg), has been identified. URG4/URGCP gene was registered to the National Center for Biotechnology Information-GenBank (NCBI-GenBank, Entrez Genelp: 55665 and Entrez Nucleotide ID NM_017920). URG4/URGCP is located on the short arm of chromosome 7 (7p13) and synthesizes a protein containing 922 amino acids in the cytoplas. Relationship between URG4/URGCP expression and clinicopathologic characteristics were evaluated and significant results were in various cancer types such as hepatocellular carcinoma, osteosarcoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, bladder cancer, gastric cancer and glioma. Although, biological activity of URG4/URGCP and its effect mechanism in malignant cells is not fully understood, all interesting and promising results shows that URG4/URGCP may be a putative oncogene that contributes to multistep carcinogenesis, cell cycle regulation and other important biological process in the cell.

AB Molecular targeted therapy for specific genes is an emerging research. Retinoic Acid Receptor (RAR-beta) is a key tumor suppressor which is found to be lost drastically during much cancer progression. We hence, analyzed the expression level of RAR-beta gene during B(a)P induced lung cancer development in mice and studied the lung cancer targeted action of All Trans Retinoic Acid (ATRA) in DOTAP liposomal formulation. The effect of its treatment on lung cancer was determined by histopathological analysis. RAR-beta gene expression was assessed by RT-PCR and qPCR. A distinct band for RAR-beta gene (density - 0.5123 for lung and 0.5160 for liver) was observed in normal mice, whereas no visible band was observed in cancer induced group, indicating loss of RAR-beta gene expression. Both ATRA and lipo-ATRA treated groups showed detectable RAR-beta expression with relatively lesser density than the normal group. The expression was more intense in lipo-ATRA treatment (density-0.2973) compared with free ATRA treatment (density-0.1549) in lung tissues. The qPCR results also have highlighted a highly significant (p <= 0.01) variation RQ values between lipo-ATRA group (15.46 +/- 1.54) and free ATRA group (7.58 +/- 1.30) in lung tissue sample on 30th day. The mean RQ value for normal lung on 30th day was 20.86 +/- 2.58 against the cancer control. The 120th day mice also showed the similar RAR-beta expression pattern with further declined expression levels as there was no treatment given after 30 days. Interestingly, the lipo-ATRA treatment could show a highly significant (p <= 0.001) expression (12.00 +/- 2.31) when compared with free ATRA treatment (3.31 +/- 0.58) which implies that the lipo-ATRA formulation could result in sustained delivery of ATRA in target site. Histopathology of lung and liver on 120th day also revealed an effective therapeutic indication in lipo-ATRA treatment compared to free ATRA treatment due to lipo-ATRA's stealth property and it efficiently inhibited the metastasis to liver. These results revealed that the lipo-ATRA treatment has efficiently delivered ATRA into target site than free ATRA and in-turn it might have induced the expression of RAR-beta gene or prevented loss of RAR-beta gene in cancer animals.

AB Preeclampsia is a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy and is one of the most common causes of poor perinatal outcomes. Preeclampsia increases the risk of hypertension in the future. Variants of WNKI (lysine deficient protein kinase 1), ADRB2 (beta 2 adrenergic receptor), NEDD4L (ubiquitin-protein ligase NEDD4-like), KLKI (kallikrein 1) contribute to hypertension, and AKR1C3 (aldo-keto reductase familyl member C3), is associated with preeclampsia. The association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in these five candidate preeclampsia susceptibility genes and the related traits in Chinese individuals were investigated. In this study, 13 SNPs of the five genes were genotyped in 276 preeclampsia patients and 229 age- and area-matched normal pregnancies in women of Chinese Northern Han origin. The 95% confidence interval (CI) and odds ratio (OR) were estimated by binary logistic regression. No obvious linkage disequilibrium or haplotypes were observed among these SNPs. Those with GG genotype and allele G of AKRIC3 (rs10508293) had a decreased risk of preeclampsia (adjusted OR = 3.011, 95% CI = 1.758-5.159, and adjusted OR = 1.745, 95% CI = 1.349-2.257, respectively). The AA genotype and allele A of WNK1 (rs1468326) were significantly associated with an increased risk in preeclampsia (adjusted OR = 2.307, 95% CI = 1.206-3.443, and adjusted OR = 1.663, 95% CI = 1.283-2.157, respectively). The findings indicate that the GG genotype of AKR1C3 rs10508293 is associated with decreased risk for preeclampsia and the AA genotype of WNK1 rs1468326 are related with an increased risk for preeclampsia.

AB The Pacific white shrimp Penaeus vannamei is the most cultured shrimp species around the world. Because females grow larger than males, the culture of 'only females' is of great interest, but knowledge on sex determination and differentiation is required for producing only females. In an effort to obtain information associated with reproduction in P. vannamei, transcriptomic data from female gonads was generated, and partial sequences of a transcript were identified as Sex-lethal (Sxl). Its characterization indicated that, differently from other penaeids in which this gene has been isolated, there are six isoforms of the Sxl transcript in P. vannamei (PvanSxl 1-6). These isoforms result from alternative splicing at three splice sites (SS1, SS2, SS3). The first splice site is unique to P. vannamei, as it has not been reported for other Arthropod species; the second splice-site (SS2) is common among crustaceans, and the third splice-site (SS3) is also unique to P. vannamei and when spliced-out, it is always together with SS2. All isoforms are expressed during embryogenesis as well as gametogenesis of both genders. The two shorter isoforms, PvanSxl-5 and PvanSxl-6, which result from the splicing of SS2 and SS3, were found mostly expressed in adult testis, but PvanSxl-6 was also expressed in oocytes during gametogenesis. During oogenesis, the second largest isoform, PvanSxl-2, which splices-out only SS1, and PvanSxl-4 that splices-out SS1 and SS2 were highly expressed. These two isoforms were also highly expressed during embryonic development. In situ hybridization allowed pinpointing more specifically the cells where the PvanSxl transcripts were expressed. During embryogenesis, hybridization was observed from the one-cell stage embryo to late gastrula. In the female gonad in previtellogenesis, hybridization occurred in the nucleus of oocytes, whereas in secondary vitellogenesis the transcript also hybridized cytoplasmic granules and cortical crypts. Finally, in situ hybridization corroborated the expression of PvanSxl also in the male gonad during spermatogenesis, mostly occurring in the cytoplasm from spermatogonia and spermatocytes.

AB Aberrated glucose metabolism is a key future of cancer cells. Unlike normal cells, tumor cells favor glycolysis even in the presence of sufficient oxygen. Pyruvate kinase (PK), a key glucose metabolic enzyme, converts phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to pyruvate by transferring the high-energy phosphate group to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), one of the four isozyme of PK, which universally expressed in rapidly proliferating cells such as embryonic cells and cancer cells. Recent years, more and more research suggested PKM2 plays a crucial role in cancer progression through both metabolic and non-metabolic pathways. On the one hand, the middle product of glycolysis, such as amino acids, nucleotides, lipids is necessary to rapid growth of cancer cells. On the other hand, PKM2 supports tumor growth through regulating the expression of gene that involved in cell proliferation, migration and apoptosis. In this article, we review the recent advances to further understand the regulation and function of PKM2 in tumorigenesis. Given its multiple effects on cancer, PKM2 may be a potential target for cancer diagnosis and treatment.

AB Protein turnover is required for muscle growth and regeneration and several proteolytic enzymes, including the calpains, degrade myofibrillar proteins during this process. In a previous experiment, phenotypic differences were observed between mu-calpain knockout (KO) and wild type (WT) mice, including nutrient accretion and fiber type differences. These changes were particularly evident as the animals aged. Thus, we utilized 18 mice (9 KO and 9 WT) to compare transcript abundance to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at 52 wk of age. A total of 55 genes were differentially expressed, including adiponectin, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1, uncoupling protein 1, and lysine deficient protein kinase 2. These genes were analyzed for over- and under-represented gene ontology (GO) terms. Several GO terms, including response to cytokine, response to interferon beta, regulation of protein phosphorylation, and hydrolase activity, were identified as overrepresented. Pathways related to taurine biosynthesis, nitric oxide synthase signaling, amyloid processing, and L-cysteine degradation were also identified. Our results are consistent with previous experiments, in that identified DEGs may explain, at least in part, some of the phenotypic differences between p-calpain KO and WT mice. Clearly muscle growth and maintenance are complex, multifaceted processes. Genes affected by the silencing of the mu-calpain gene have been identified, but the relationship between p-calpain and these pathways requires further investigation.

AB Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE; OMIM 152700) is a highly heterogeneous disorder, characterized by differences in autoantibody profile, serum cytokines, and a multi-system involvement commonly affecting the skin, renal, musculoskeletal, and hematopoetic systems clinical manifestations involving. Disease features range from mild manifestations, such as rash or arthritis, to life-threatening end-organ manifestations, such as glomerulonephritis or thrombosis, and it is difficult to predict which manifestations will affect a given patient. SLE is caused by interactions between susceptibility genes and environmental factors resulting in an irreversible loss of immunologic self-tolerance. Incidence is highest in women during the reproductive years; however, people of all ages, genders, and ancestral backgrounds are susceptible. A striking 9:1 female to male differential appears in incidence, which remains largely unexplained. However, people of both sexes and all ages and ethnic backgrounds are susceptible. Distinct differences regarding the pathogenesis of SLE between patients of different ancestral backgrounds have been observed so far, including differences in specific clinical manifestations, disease-susceptibility genetic variants and IFN levels. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have attempted to elucidate partially the complex genetic architecture of SLE and to point out the existing differences in risk variants across different continental populations, considering that some alleles have not been found in all ancestral backgrounds. Levels of circulating IFN-alpha is a heritable risk factor in SLE with causal role in pathogenesis, they differ between SLE patients from different ancestral backgrounds and this information could be important as therapeutics is developed to target this pathway. This review highlights some recent findings referred to the multilevel differences appearing in SLE patients from different ancestral backgrounds and further understanding of this knowledge may permit the development of personalized treatments based on patients' ancestry.

AB The GCC is an economic alliance of six Arab countries, including Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and United Arab Emirates (UAE). The rate of endogamous marriage among the GCC countries is approaching 100%, with very high consanguineous marriage rates. Although breast cancer is on the rise in the GCC countries, there are dearth of studies reporting on the genetic epidemiology of breast cancer. In this study, we investigated the frequency of BRCA1/2 and non-BRCA1/2 mutations in breast cancer patients in the GCC countries. BRCA1/2 mutations seem not to be significantly involved in hereditary breast cancer in the GCC countries, which is the most reported form of cancer in Oman, however no available data about the BRCA1/2 mutations role in breast cancer in the UAE. Mutations in more than 30 non-BRCA1/2 genes were reported to be associated with breast cancer patients in the GCC countries, some with comparable frequencies to the BRCA1/2 genes. Arab patients with breast cancer showed advanced stages of cancer and younger ages of onset compared to other Western countries. The Arab genome project pioneered by Saudi Arabia, followed by Qatar, Kuwait, and UAE, will help in the identification of new biomarkers for breast cancer that will be a target for new therapeutics and is expected to improve the prognosis of the disease. However, there is an urgent need for extensive well-controlled genetic epidemiological studies to provide accurate estimates of the frequency of genetic variants in both BRCA1/2 and non-BRCA1/2 among patients with breast cancer in the Gulf States, to provide better care and genetic counseling for Arab patients with predisposing genetic mutations to breast cancer.

AB The physis is a well-established and anatomically distinct cartilaginous structure that is crucial for normal long bone development and growth. Abnormalities in physis function are linked to growth plate disorders and other pediatric musculoskeletal diseases. Understanding the molecular pathways operative in the physis may permit development of regenerative therapies to complement surgically-based procedures that are the current standard of care for growth plate disorders. Here, we performed next generation RNA sequencing on mRNA isolated from human physis and other skeletal tissues (e.g., articular cartilage and bone; n = 7 for each tissue).
   We observed statistically significant enrichment of gene sets in the physis when compared to the other musculoskeletal tissues. Further analysis of these upregulated genes identified physis-specific networks of extracellular matrix proteins including collagens (COL2A1, COL6A1, COL9A1, COL14A1, COL16A1) and matrilins (MATN1, MATN2, MATN3), and signaling proteins in the WNT pathway (WNT10B, FZD1, FZD10, DKK2) or the FGF pathway (FGF10, FGFR4). Our results provide further insight into the gene expression networks that contribute to the physis' unique structural composition and regulatory signaling networks. Physis-specific expression profiles may guide ongoing initiatives in tissue engineering and cell-based therapies for treatment of growth plate disorders and growth modulation therapies. Furthermore, our findings provide new leads for therapeutic drug discovery that would permit future intervention through pharmacological rather than surgical strategies.

AB Several factors are involved in the periodontitis with host response through cytokines and as well as with influence of polymorphisms in cytokine genes, however the results remained contradictory. This study aimed at evaluating the rs1143634 polymorphism in interleukin-1B gene, a cytokine gene, and the risk of chronic periodontitis with conducting a meta-analysis focusing in ethnicity. A review in literature was performed in several databases to studies published before June 2017. Data extraction was performed by two calibrated investigators and the calculations of the meta-analysis were obtained through Review Manager version 5.2 statistical software with Odds Ratio (OR) calculation and Funnel plot (P < 0.05) to heterogeneity and the Comprehensive Meta analysis version 3.3.070 to assessment publication bias by Egger's and Begg's tests. In overall, 54 case/control studies composed the meta-analysis. T allele was significantly associated with patients case (OR = 1.35, 95% CI: 1.24, 1.48, P < 0.00001) in the overall analysis. The stratified evaluation showed the rs1143634 polymorphism had significant association with disease in Caucasian, Asian and mixed population was excepted in African ethnicity (P > 0.05). No publication bias was found in allelic evaluation. This meta-analysis in 9376 participants with 54 case/control studies revealed the rs1143634 polymorphism was associated with elevated risk of chronic periodontitis in overall analysis as well as Caucasian and Asian ethnicities and Mixed population.

AB MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small (about 22 nucleotides) noncoding RNAs, which were highly conserved among mammals. They have ushered in a new era in molecular biology over twenty years. They can negatively regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level through the principle of complementary base pairing with the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of their target mRNAs and induce their degradation. They involve in tissue morphogenesis, cellular processes like apoptosis, and major signaling pathways. Previous studies have promoted our understanding that miRNAs play an important role in myogenesis and have a big impact on muscle mass, muscle fiber type and muscle diseases. Many researchers have provided evidence of the involvement of muscle-specific and enriched miRNAs in the individual stages of skeletal muscle development as well as of their significant influence on muscle metabolism during quiescence, proliferation, differentiation and regeneration. Here, we focus on the microRNAs that related to the development of skeletal muscle. For example, some microRNAs are upregulated in differentiated skeletal muscle and can promote differentiation, like, miR-1, miR-24, miR-26a, miR-181 and miR-206. However, some microRNAs highly expressed in proliferating myoblasts, downregulated in differentiated and could inhibit differentiation, like MiR-221 and miR-222. Some others not only promote skeletal muscle proliferation, but also promote differentiation, like miR-214. Studying the miRNAs' regulatory mechanisms in skeletal development will help us know more about the knowledge of miRNAs in muscle developmental biology and make us learn more about involved signal pathway.

AB Although ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a common, highly heritable arthropathy, the precise genetic mechanism underlying the disease remains elusive. Here, we investigate the disease-causing mutations in a large AS family with distinguished complexity, consisting of 23 patients covering four generations and exhibiting a mixed HLA-B27 (+) and (-) status. Linkage analysis with 32 members using three methods and whole-exome sequencing analysis with three HLA-B27 (+) patients, one HLA-B27 (-) patient, and one healthy individual did not identify a mutation common to all of the patients, strongly suggesting the existence of genetic heterogeneity in this large pedigree. However, if only B27-positive patients were analyzed, the linkage analysis located a 22-Mb region harboring the HLA gene cluster in chromosome 6 (LOD = 4.2), and the subsequent exome analysis identified two non-synonymous mutations in the TREML2 and 1P6K3 genes. These genes were resequenced among 370 sporadic AS patients and 487 healthy individuals. A significantly higher mutation frequency of TREML2 was observed in AS patients (1.51% versus 0.21%). The results obtained for the AS pedigree and sporadic patients suggest that mutation of TREML2 is a major factor leading to AS for HLA-B27 (+) members in this large family and that TREML2 is also a susceptibility gene promoting the development of ankylosing spondylitis in HLA-B27 (+) individuals.

AB We report two Egyptian male genomes (EGP1 and EGP2) sequenced at similar to 30 x sequencing depths. EGP1 had 4.7 million variants, where 198,877 were novel variants while EGP2 had 209,109 novel variants out of 4.8 million variants. The mitochondrial haplogroup of the two individuals were identified to be H7b1 and L2a1c, respectively. We also identified the Y haplogroup of EGP1 (Rib) and EGP2 (J1a2a1a2 > P58 > FGC11). EGP1 had a mutation in the NADH gene of the mitochondrial genome ND4 (m.11778 G > A) that causes Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy. Some SNPs shared by the two genomes were associated with an increased level of cholesterol and triglycerides, probably related with Egyptians obesity. Comparison of these genomes with African and Western-Asian genomes can provide insights on Egyptian ancestry and genetic history. This resource can be used to further understand genomic diversity and functional classification of variants as well as human migration and evolution across Africa and Western-Asia.

AB Phenylketonuria (PKU) is the most common inherited metabolic disease, an autosomal recessive disorder affecting > 10,000 newborns each year globally. It can be caused by over 1000 different naturally occurring mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene. We analyzed three novel naturally occurring PAH gene variants: p.G1u178Lys (c.532G > A), p.Va1245Met (c.733G > A) and p.Ser250Phe (c.749C > T). The mutant effect on the PAH enzyme structure and function was predicted by bioinformatics software. Vectors expressing the corresponding PAH variants were generated for expression in E. coil and in HEK293T cells. The RNA expression of the three PAH variants was measured by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The mutant PAH protein levels were determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SIDS-PAGE), western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). All three variants were predicted to be pathogenic by bioinformatics analysis. The transcription of the three PAH variants was similar to the wild type PAH gene in HEK293T cells. In contrast, the levels of mutant PAH proteins decreased significantly compared to the wild type control, in both E. coil and HEK293T cells. Our results indicate that the three novel PAH gene variants (p.G1u178Lys, p.Va1245Met, p.Ser250Phe) impair PAH protein expression and function in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.

AB Retinoblastoma (RB) is an intraocular malignancy for children and has a high mortality rate. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as gene regulators and biomarkers in various malignancies. PANDAR is a novel cancer-related lncRNA that dysregulated in several types of cancers. However, its clinical value and potential effects on RB remains unclear. RT-qPCR was used to assess the relative expression of PANDAR in RB tissues and cells. Additionally, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and luciferase reporter assays were performed to investigate whether SP1 could bind to the promoter region of PANDAR and activate its transcription. Furthermore, in vitro and in vivo studies were induced to elucidate the biological functions of PANDAR. The results indicated that PANDAR was increased in RB tissues and cells, and this upregulation was associated with advanced IIRC stage, positive optic nerve invasion, and lower differentiation grade in RB patients. In addition, SP1 could bind directly to the PANDAR promoter region and activate its transcription. Furthermore, PANDAR silencing yielded tumor suppressive effects both in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, PANDAR protects against apoptosis partly by affecting BcI-2/caspase-3 pathway. Ultimately, our work first illustrate that PANDAR plays an oncogenic role in RB and may offer a potential therapeutic target for treating this devastating disease.

AB Serine/threonine kinase 11 (STK11) is a protein kinase that is encoded by Stk11 gene located on chromosome 19 and 10 in humans and mouse respectively. It acts as a master kinase of adenine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway that coordinates the regulation of cellular energy metabolism and cell division. STK11 exerts effect by activating more than 14 kinases including AMPK and AMPK-related kinases. It is also known to regulate cell polarity and acts as tumor suppressor. Alternative splicing of pre-mRNA is a mechanism which results in multiple transcript variants of a single gene. In human, two STK11 isoforms have been reported, an alternatively spliced isoform which has variation at its C-terminal and mostly expressed in testis (LKB1(S)). Another isoform exhibiting oncogenic properties lacks few residues at its N-terminal (Delta N-LKB1). In the present study, we report the identification of a new transcript variant Stk11N which is generated through alternative splicing. The new variant was found to have differential and tissue specific expression at Postnatal-7 and adult stages of mouse. As compared to the known variant Stk11C, the conceptually translated amino acid sequences of the new variant differ from exon-E2 onwards. In silico post translational studies of the new and published variant show similarity in some of the properties while differ in properties like nuclear export signals, phosphorylation, glycosylation, etc. Thus, alternative splicing of Stk11 gene generating new variant with heterogeneous properties suggests for complex regulation of these variants in controlling the AMPK pathway and other functions.

AB Object With the development of GWAS, both TNFAIP3 and TNIP1 were revealed to be susceptibility genes of SLE. However, some other studies revealed no association between TNFAIP3, TNIP1 and SLE susceptibility. In order to estimate such association more precisely and systemically, a meta-analysis was conducted.
   Method: Studies on the association between TNFAIP3 rs2230926, TNIP1 rs7708392 and SLE risk were carefully selected via searching 3 databases (Pubmed, Embase, and Web of Science). A fixed- or random-effect model was used according to the heterogeneity, and a subgroup analysis by ethnicity was also performed.
   Results: 26 studies from 18 articles involving a total of 21,372 patients and 30,165 controls were analyzed for TNFAIP3 rs2230926. A significant association between the minor G allele of TNFAIP3 rs2230926 and SLE risk was found via a random-effect model (OR = 1.643, 95% CI = (1.462, 1.847), p < 0.01). In the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, significant correlations were also found in all Caucasians, Asians, and Africans (OR = 1.675, 95% CI = (1.353, 2.074), p < 0.01; OR = 1.738, 95% CI = (1.557, 1.940), p < 0.01; OR = 1.324, 95% CI = (1.029, 1.704), p < 0.05). As for TNIP1 rs7708392, 21 studies from 12 articles involving 24,716 cases and 32,200 controls were analyzed. A significant association of the minor C allele of TNIP1 rs7708392 and SLE risk was found via a random-effect model (OR = 1.247, 95% CI = (1.175, 1.323), p < 0.01). In the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, significant correlations were found in Caucasians, and Africans (OR = 1.317, 95% CI = (1.239, 1.401), p < 0.01; OR = 1.210, 95% CI = (1.108, 1.322), p < 0.01). However, there was no significant association in Asians (OR = 1.122, 95% CI = (0.953, 1.321), p > 0.05).
   Conclusion: The minor G allele of TNFAIP3 rs2230926 was associated with increased risk of SLE in all Caucasians, Asians, and Africans. The minor C allele of TNIP1 rs7708392 was associated with the increased risk of SLE in Caucasians and Africans, while it was not associated with SLE susceptibility in Asians.

AB The Yangtze River delta white goat is the only goat breed that produces high-quality brush hair, which is specifically used in top-grade writing brushes. Previous studies have indicated that the CMTM3 and DUSP1 genes are involved in the growth and cycle of high-quality brush hair, and these genes are thought to be involved in the formation of high-quality brush hair traits. In this study, we investigated the relationship between methylation of CMTM3 and DUSP1 and such traits. The results indicated that the relative expression levels of the CMTM3 and DUSP1 genes were higher in non-high-quality brush hair than in high-quality brush hair. Furthermore, the CpG sites of the DUSP1 gene were not methylated, and the methylation level of CMTM3 was negatively correlated with the gene expression level. We believe that the DUSP1 gene regulates the formation of high-quality brush hair by non-methylated, and that methylation of the CMTM3 gene results in a decrease in its expression, causing an increase in the activity of the androgen receptor and the level of androgen. This high androgen level promotes the growth of high-quality brush hair. These study results provide a theoretical basis for further elucidating the molecular mechanism of the formation of high-quality brush hair characteristics, and provide scientific reference for the molecular breeding of high-quality brush hair.

AB Objectives: The current study aimed to investigate FSH receptor binding inhibitor (FRBI) effects in the expressions of FSH receptor (FSHR) and estrogen receptor-beta (ER beta) in the mice ovaries at the gene and protein levels, also to find the potential efficacy of FRBI on suppressing ovarian cancer through down-regulating over-expression of FSHR and ER beta in the normal ovarian tissues.
   Methods: 180 female mice were randomized into six groups (n = 30). Mice of FRBI-1, FRBI-2 and FRBI-3, FRBI-4 were intramuscularly injected with FRBI of 10, 20, 30 and 40 mg/kg, respectively, for five consecutive days. The qPCR and Western blotting were used to determine expression levels of FSHR and ER beta mRNAs and proteins in mouse ovaries.
   Results: The ovarian cortex thickness (OCT) of the FRBI-4 group were less than that FSH group on day 30 (P < 0.05). The numbers of secondary follicles (SF) and the maximum transverse diameters (MTD) of secondary follicles of FRBI-3 and FRBI-4 groups were decreased as compared to FSH group (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01) by 24.11% and 27.47% on day 20 based on the control group (CG) levels. On day 15, the reductions of FSHR mRNA levels in FRBI-2, FRBI-3 and FRBI-4 were 27.78%, 29.37% and 43.65% (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01), respectively in comparison with CG. ER beta and FSHR protein levels of FRBI-treated mice were gradually decreased as compared to and CG and FSH group. ER beta protein level of FRBI-4 was less than that of CG on day 20 (P < 0.05). On days 15 and 20, estradiol (E-2) concentrations of FRBI-2, FRBI-3 and FRBI-4 groups were lower than those of the CG and FSH group (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01).
   Conclusions: FRBI could reduce OCT and follicle numbers. A high dose of FRBI (30 mg/kg to 40 mg/kg) could suppress ovarian and follicular development, and attenuate expression levels of ER beta and FSHR mRNAs and proteins in the ovaries, additionally inhibit E-2 production. Therefore, FRBI will possibly be utilized to restrain the carcinogenesis of ovarian cancer by down-regulating overexpression of FSHR and ER beta in the ovaries.

AB Here, we report SLC25A13 c.1610_1612delinsAT mutation from India in a 13-year old boy who presented with recurrent episodes of delirium and hyperammonemia. This is the second case with this mutation; the first case was of Pakistani origin. The boy responded to diet modification, sodium benzoate and arginine supplementation. Furthermore, we have aimed to establish genotype-phenotype correlation of 79 cases of citrin deficiency (46 males and 33 females) reported in 24 studies from all over the world. Inverse association was observed between age of onset and jaundice (r = -0.73). Late age of onset was associated with delirium (r = 0.61), aggressive behaviour (r = 0.67), altered sensorium (r = 0.67) and tremors (r = 0.65). The most common mutations associated with citrin deficiency were c.851_854deI4, IVS16ins3kb, 1638-1660dup with a frequency of 42.41%, 16.46% and 6.33%, respectively. The c.851_854de14 mutation showed positive association with alpha feto protein (r = 0.40), ammonia (r = 0.50) and tyrosine (r = 0.40) while showing inverse association with threonine (r = -0.55). The IVS16ins3kb mutation was associated with high total (r = 0.65) and conjugated bilirubin (r = 0.54) along with high aspartate transaminase (r = 0.49) while citrulline levels are lower (r = -0.36). To conclude, all cases of intrahepatic cholestasis and neuropsychiatric abnormalities should be evaluated for citrin deficiency. However, the ethnic group-specific mutation frequencies should be considered in implementing screening.

AB Salmonella enterica is a causative agent of enteric and systemic salmonellosis that affects human and many other animal species. Due to the emergence of drug-resistant strains, available drugs against S. enterica infection are no more effective as before. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop new therapeutic strategies. The current study aims at prioritizing therapeutic targets by an in-silico genomics driven method. The method involves searching proteins of each Salmonella strain for essentiality, virulence and antibiotic-resistance and host-pathogen protein protein interactions. Using subtractive genomics approach, we further confirmed that none of the selected protein shares sequence homology with any human (host) protein and also with proteins from human symbiotic gut flora. Pathway analysis of these screened proteins revealed associated biological processes. Presence of proteins in pathogen-specific pathways was used as one of the assessment property in the subsequent scoring scheme. Simultaneously proteins are screened based on parameters like druggability (sequence similarity with existing drug targets), sub-cellular localization and presence of transmembrane domain. The implemented scoring scheme depicted a final list of 14 potential therapeutic targets out of which 6 could be identified as 'high-confidence' targets based on extensive literature curation. Identified therapeutic targets can aid in the design and development of effective antibacterial agents against S. enterica. The genomics driven strategy adopted in this study can also be applied to screen therapeutic targets for other pathogens.

AB Fall webworm, Hyphantria cunea Drury (Lepidoptera: Arctiidae) is extremely adaptable and highly invasive in China as a defoliator of ornamental and forest trees. Both voltinism and diapause strategies of fall webworm in China are variable, and this variability contributes to it invasiveness. Little is known about molecular regulation of diapause in fall webworm. To gain insight into possible mechanisms of diapause induction, high-throughput RNA-seq data were generated from non-diapause pupae (NDP) and diapause pupae (DP). A total of 58,151 unigenes were assembled and researched against nine public databases. In total, 29,013 up-regulated and 3451 down-regulated unigenes were differentially expressed by DP when compared with those of NDP. Genes encoding proteins such as UDP-glycosyl transferase (UGT), cytochrome P450 and Hsp70 were predicted to be involved in diapause. Moreover, GO function and KEGG pathway enrichments were performed on all differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and showed that cell cycle and insulin signaling pathways may be related to the diapause of the fall webworm. This study provides valuable information about the fall webworm transcriptome for future gene function research, especially as it relates to diapause.

AB Studies in E. sinensis have shown that ubiquitination mediated by Cullin-RING E3 ligases (CRLs) plays important roles in spermatogenesis. In other species, CRLs are also essential in cell cycle progression, DNA replication, signal transduction, gene transcription, and development. The catalytic RING component, the RING box protein, is an important part of CRLs. However, there have been few studies on CRLs in crustaceans. In this study, we cloned two RING box protein genes from the Chinese mitten crab, Eriocheir sinensis, termed Es-RBX1 and Es-RBX2 The full length Es-RBX1 cDNA comprises 741 nucleotides, and encodes a protein of 124 amino acid residues, whereas the Es-RBX2 cDNA comprises 1325 nucleotides, and encodes a protein of 110 amino acid residues. Bioinformatics analysis showed that the domains and structure of the RBX proteins have been highly conserved during evolution. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blotting showed that Es-RBX1 is highly expressed in the testis, particularly during the spermatocyte stage, whereas Es-RBX2 did not show specific expression in the male reproductive system. Furthermore, Es-RBX1 is mainly distributed in the nucleus, and changed its location with the development of the nucleus. Co-immunoprecipitation showed that Es-RBX1 could bind Cullin4. These results suggested that Es-RBX1 plays a key role in spermatogenesis of E. sinensis though forming a complex with Cullin4.

AB The mechanism by which bta-miR-378 regulates bovine skeletal muscle-derived satellite cell (bMDSC) myogenesis remains unknown. In this study, stem-loop RT-PCR was used to assess bta-miR-378 expression during the proliferation and differentiation of bMDSCs. The results showed that bta-miR-378 expression did not obviously change during bMDSC proliferation but increased significantly when bMDSCs began to differentiate. Then, a bta-miR-378 mimic (bta-miR-378-M) and bta-miR-378 inhibitor (bta-miR-378-I) were transfected into bMDSCs to explore the effect of bta-miR-378 on bMDSC differentiation. Cell differentiation was detected using myosin heavy chain 3 immunofluorescence, myotube formation, and desmin and myogenin western blotting analyses. As expected, bta-miR-378-M enhanced bMDSC differentiation, whereas bta-miR-378-I had the opposite effect. Moreover, luciferase reporter and western blotting assays showed that bta-miR-378 directly targeted the 3'-untranslated regions of DNA polymerase alpha subunit B (POLA2) to regulate its protein expression. In summary, these data indicate that bta-miR-378 targets POLA2 to promote the differentiation of bMDSCs, which provides further insight into the biological functions of bta-miR-378 in bovines.

AB Background: Rotavirus (RV) vaccination has been available in Japan since November 2011, but is not yet part of Japan's national immunisation programs. There are insufficient data on vaccine effectiveness (VE) among Japanese children.
   Methods: Between the months of January and May in 2014 and 2015, we conducted active surveillance of gastroenteritis among children at 14 medical facilities. Rectal swabs from all patients with diarrhoea or vomiting were tested for RV by immunochromatography, and positive specimens were genotyped. Demographic data and immunisation records were obtained from a questionnaire completed by their parents/guardians or medical records. A test-negative case-control design was used to examine vaccine effectiveness (VE) using unconditional logistic regression analysis adjusted for possible confounding factors.
   Results: Among the 1519 eligible subjects (children with acute gastroenteritis symptoms aged >= 2 months to <3 y visiting medical facilities) recruited, 487 cases and 925 controls were enrolled. Cases had more severe symptoms than controls, requiring more intensive treatment, including intravenous rehydration or hospitalisation. VE against all rotavirus gastroenteritis (RVGE) was 80.0% (95% confidence interval [Cl], 72.8-85.5%), and VEs against RV1 and RV5 were similar, at 80.6% (95%Cl, 70.7-87.1%) for RV1 and 80.4% (95% CI, 69.1-87.6%) for RV5. Although VEs of both vaccines decreased with age, VEs against all RVGE were >70% up to 2 years after vaccination. VEs increased with severity of RVGE, and VE against severe RVGE, requiring intravenous rehydration or hospitalisation, was 97.3% (95% CI, 88.8-99.3%). VEs of RV1 and RV5 against GIP[8] and G2P[4] were comparable, at RV1, 89.8% (95% Cl, 78.2-95.5%) and 78.3% (95% CI, 23.6-93.8%); and RV5, 85.8% (95% CI, 72.8-92.6%) and 88.1% (95% CI, 10.1-98.4%), respectively.
   Conclusions: Rotavirus vaccines were effective in preventing mild to severe RVGE, irrespective of vaccine type, time since vaccination, or RV genotype. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Vaccines prevent infections and avoid related complications. Low rates in immunocompromised patients are concerning due to increased morbidity. Vaccinations are less effective when administered post-transplant and should be administered prior. We describe pre-transplant vaccination rates among kidney or kidney-pancreas transplant recipients.
   Methods: Retrospective review including adults receiving kidney or kidney-pancreas allografts at Cleveland Clinic from October 2013 to October 2016. Pre-transplant vaccinations, serologies, and transplant data were collected.
   Results: 393 patients were included; median age was 53 years with most (46%) being Caucasian males. Influenza vaccination rate was 48%; receipt of at least one pneumococcal vaccine was 77%. Vaccination rates were higher among dialysis patients for pneumococcal, hepatitis B, and varicella vaccines; rates were also higher with infectious diseases consults.
   Conclusions: Vaccination rates at our institution for kidney or kidney-pancreas transplant candidates are consistent with previous literature. Rates were higher for candidates with infectious diseases consults or receiving dialysis. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Schmallenberg virus (SBV), which emerged in 2011 in Central Europe and subsequently spread very rapidly throughout the continent, affects predominantly ruminants. SBV is transmitted by insect vectors, and therefore vaccination is one of the major tools of disease control. Only recently, a domain connected to virus neutralization has been identified at the amino-terminal part of the viral envelope protein Gc. Here, this Gc domain delivered by recombinant EHV-1 or MVA vector viruses was tested in a vaccination-challenge trial in cattle, one of the major target species of SBV.
   The EHV-1-based vaccine conferred protection in two of four animals, whereas immunization using the MVA vector vaccine efficiently induced an SBV-specific antibody response and full protection against SBV challenge infection in all the vaccinated animals. Moreover, due to the absence of antibodies against SBVs N-protein, both vector vaccines enable the differentiation between vaccinated and field-infected animals making them to a promising tool to control SBV spread as well as to prevent disease in domestic ruminants.

AB More than 50% of the world's population is infected with the bacterium Helicobacter pylori. If left untreated, infection with H. pylori can cause chronic gastritis and peptic ulcer disease, which may progress into gastric cancer. Owing to the limited efficacy of anti-H. pylori antibiotic therapy in clinical practice, the development of a protective vaccine to combat this pathogen has been a tempting goal for several years. In this study, a chimeric gene coding for the antigenic parts of H. pylori FIiD, UreB, VacA, and CagL was generated and expressed in bacteria and the potential of the resulting fusion protein (rFUVL) to induce humoral and cellular immune responses and to provide protection against H. pylori infection was evaluated in mice. Three different immunization adjuvants were tested along with rFUVL: CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG ODN), Addavax, and Cholera toxin subunit B. Compared to the control group that had received PBS, vaccinated mice showed significantly higher cellular recall responses and antigen-specific IgG2a, IgG1, and gastric IgA antibody titers. Importantly, rFUVL immunized mice exhibited a reduction of about three orders of magnitude in their stomach bacterial loads. Thus, adjuvanted rFUVL might be considered as a promising vaccine candidate for the control of H. pylori infection. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   ASSOCIATION; PROGRAM
AB Background: Both re-emergence of pertussis outbreak among adolescents/adults and recent approval of the extended use of DTaP vaccine for boosting adolescents/adults against pertussis in Japan, have raised the possibility of using aP-containing vaccine in pregnant women to protect neonates and unvaccinated infants. There is a need, therefore, to evaluate the value for money of such possibility.
   Methods: We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of conducting antepartum maternal vaccination (AMV) strategy in Japan. Considering the duration of vaccine effectiveness for infant (single year) and for mother (multiple years), the decision tree model and Markov model was adapted for infant and mother, respectively. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) compared with current no AMV strategy from societal perspective were calculated. The transition probabilities, utility weights to estimate quality-adjusted life year (QALY), and disease treatment costs were either calculated or extracted from literature. Costs per vaccination was assumed at (sic)6000/US$54.5. Markov model for mothers with one-year cycle runs up to year four after vaccination, based on the waning of vaccine effectiveness. Infant who survived from pertussis was assumed to live until to his/her life expectancy.
   Results: AMV strategy reduces disease treatment costs, while the reduction cannot offset the vaccination cost. Incremental QALYs were at 0.0002802, among them 79.5% were from infants, and others from mothers. ICER was (sic)9,149,317/US$83,176 per QALY gained. One-way sensitivity analyses identified that the incidence rate and costs per shot were the two main key variables to impact the ICER.
   Conclusion: We found that vaccinating pregnant women with aP-containing vaccine to prevent neonatal and unvaccinated infants from pertussis-associated disease in Japan can be cost-effective from societal perspective, under the WHO-suggested "cost-effective" criteria (1 to 3 times of GDP). Pertussis is expected be designated as a notifiable disease in 2018, re-analysis should be conducted when straightforward incidence data is available. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   healthcare; Education; Expanded Program on Immunization

AB Background: Childhood mortality in Afghanistan fell by half between 1990 and 2015, due in part to the government's commitment to improving pediatric immunization services. Although progress has been made, immunization coverage has nonetheless remained low with only 65% of children receiving the third dose of Diphtheria-Pertussis-Tetanus (DPT3) based on WHO estimates. This study aims to calculate the proportion of Afghan children aged 1-4 years who were fully vaccinated, under-vaccinated, or non vaccinated with government-recommended Expanded Program on Immunization vaccines and identify predictors related to the family's sociodemographic status and maternal autonomy.
   Methods: Data from the 2015 Afghanistan Demographic and Health Survey was used to calculate the proportion of children who were fully vaccinated (i.e. received all recommended vaccines), under-vaccinated (i.e. received some, but not all), and non-vaccinated (i.e. did not receive any vaccines) according to WHO guidelines. A multivariable multinomial logistic regression model generated odds ratios for under vaccination and non-vaccination versus full vaccination, and examined associations between independent factors and full vaccination status.
   Results: We found 40.6% of Afghan children age 1-4 were fully vaccinated, 42.4% under-vaccinated, and 17% non-vaccinated. Large disparities characterized immunization coverage among provinces and between urban and rural regions. Birthing in a government institution (vs. non-institutional setting), a higher number of antenatal care visits, and a visit to a health facility in the past 12 months were all associated with increased odds of full immunization. Factors related to maternal autonomy including maternal decision-making and maternal attitudes towards beating were also significantly associated with vaccination status.
   Conclusion: Approximately 60% of children in Afghanistan are under-vaccinated or non-vaccinated, leaving millions of children unnecessarily at risk for vaccine-preventable diseases. Engagement with community and religious leaders to create programs that increase women's autonomy and expand access to institutional delivery could lead to downstream increases in childhood vaccination coverage.

AB Household surveys are frequently used as means of vaccination coverage measurement, but obtaining accurate survey estimates present several challenges. In 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) released a working draft of its updated Vaccination Coverage Survey Reference Manual that moved well beyond the traditional Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) survey design. In April 2017, WHO convened a four-day meeting, to review lessons learned using the updated manual and to define an agenda for operational research about vaccination coverage surveys. About 70 stakeholders, including EPI managers and participants from 10 countries that have used the updated Survey Manual, survey experts, statisticians, partners, representatives from WHO regional offices and headquarters, and providers of technical assistance discussed methodological issues from sampling to accurately ascertaining a person's vaccination status, optimizing data collection and data management and conducting appropriate analyses. Participants also discussed data sharing and how to best survey data for immunization decision making. The lessons learned from the use of the updated WHO Survey Manual related mainly to operational issues to implement better quality vaccination coverage surveys. It resulted in a list of 23 recommendations for WHO, donors and partners, immunization programs, and household surveys that collect immunization data. Similarly, 14 research topics, categorized in six themes (overall survey conduction, sampling, vaccination ascertainment, data collection, data analysis and use, and inclusion of questions on knowledge, attitudes and practices) were prioritized. Top areas of further work included improving our understanding of the accuracy of caregiver recall when documented evidence of vaccination is not available, improving engagement and coordination between immunization programs and entities conducting multi-purpose household surveys such as Demographic and Health Survey and Multiple Cluster Indicator Survey, improving mechanisms for sharing vaccination survey datasets and documentation, and making better use of survey results to translate data into knowledge for decision-making. This manuscript summarizes the meeting proceedings and provides an update of actions taken by WHO since this meeting. (C) 2018 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Introduction: The aim was to assess cost-effectiveness of expanding the Swedish HPV-vaccination program to include preadolescent boys, by comparing health-effects and costs of HPV-related disease, with a sex-neutral vaccination program versus only vaccinating girls.
   Methods: We used a dynamic compartmental model to simulate the burden of HPV16/18-related disease in Sweden, accounting for indirect effects of vaccination through herd-immunity. The model accounted for sexual behaviour, such as age preferences and men who have sex with men. The main outcome was number of individuals with HPV-related cancers (cervical, genital, anal and oropharyngeal cancer) and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). Costs included in the analysis were those incurred when treating HPV-related cancer and CIN, production losses during sick-leave, and acquisition and administration of vaccine. Health effects were measured as quality-adjusted life years (QALY). The time horizon was set to 100 years, and both effects and costs were discounted by 3% annually. Health effects and costs were accumulated over the time horizon and used to create an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio.
   Results: A sex-neutral vaccination program would reduce HPV-related cancer and CIN, both due to direct effects among vaccinated as well as through herd-immunity, further decreasing HPV-related cancer burden annually by around 60 cases among men and women respectively in steady-state. The cost per gained QALY was estimated to 40,000 euro. Applying the procurement price of 2017, sex-neutral vaccination was dominant.
   Conclusion: Introducing a sex-neutral HPV-vaccination program would be good value for money also in Sweden where there this 80% coverage in the current HPV-vaccination program for preadolescent girls. The cost-effectiveness of a sex-neutral program is highly dependent on the price of the vaccine, the lower the price the more favourable it is to also vaccinate boys. (C) 2018 The Author(s).

AB Following HIV infection, most people make antibodies to gp120 and gp41, yet only a few make broadly neutralizing antibodies that target key antigenic sites on the envelope glycoproteins. The induction of broadly neutralizing antibodies by immunization remains a major challenge of HIV vaccine research. Difficulties include: variable protein sequence, epitopes that depend on the native conformation, glycosylation that conceals key antigenic determinants, and the assembly of Env trimers that mimic viral spikes. In addition, more potent immunogens may be needed to initiate the response of germline antibody precursors and drive B cell maturation toward antibodies with broad neutralizing activity.
   We have expressed HIV Env glycoproteins by incorporation into live attenuated rubella viral vectors. The rubella vaccine strain RA27/3 has demonstrated its safety and potency in millions of children. As a vector, it has elicited potent and durable immune responses in macaques to SIV Gag vaccine inserts. We now find that rubella/env vectors can stably express Env core derived glycoproteins ranging in size up to 363 amino acids from HIV Glade C strain 426c. The expressed Env glycoproteins bind broadly neutralizing antibodies that target the native CD4 binding site. The vectors grew well in rhesus macaques, and they elicited a vaccine "take" in all animals, as measured by anti-rubella antibodies. By themselves, the vectors elicited modest antibody titers to the Env insert. But the combination of rubella/env prime followed by a homologous protein boost gave a strong response. Neutralizing antibodies appeared gradually after multiple vaccine doses. The vectors will be useful for testing new vaccine inserts and immunization strategies under optimized conditions of vector growth and protein expression. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: New Zealand has funded the administration of tetanus, diphtheria and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine during pregnancy to prevent infant pertussis since 2013. The aim of this study was to assess the safety of Tdap vaccine administered to pregnant women as part of a national maternal immunisation programme.
   Methods: We conducted a national retrospective observational study using linked administrative New Zealand datasets. The study population consisted of pregnant women eligible to receive funded Tdap vaccination from 28 to 38 weeks gestation in 2013. Primary study outcomes were based on prioritised adverse events for the assessment of vaccine safety in pregnant women, as defined by WHO and Brighton Collaboration taskforces. We examined the effect of Tdap vaccination on prioritised maternal outcomes using Cox proportional hazard models. Adjusted hazard ratios controlled for key confounding variables.
   Results: In the cohort of 68,550 women eligible to receive funded antenatal Tdap vaccination during 2013, 8178 (11.9%) were vaccinated and 60,372 (88.1%) were unvaccinated. The use of Tdap in pregnancy was not associated with an increase in the rate of primary outcomes, including preterm labour; pre-eclampsia; pre-eclampsia with severe features; eclampsia; gestational hypertension; fetal growth restriction; or post-partum haemorrhage. Tdap also did not increase secondary outcomes, including gestational diabetes mellitus; antenatal bleeding; placental abruption; premature rupture of membranes; preterm delivery; fetal distress; chorioamnionitis; or, maternal fever during or after labour. Lactation disorders was the only secondary maternal outcome with a significantly increased hazard ratio. Tdap vaccine had a protective effect on pre-eclampsia with severe features, preterm labour, preterm delivery, and antenatal bleeding.
   Conclusion: We did not detect any biologically plausible adverse maternal outcomes following Tdap vaccination during pregnancy. This study provides further assurance that Tdap administration during pregnancy is not associated with unexpected safety risks. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Otitis media (OM) constitutes an important public health problem in the Inuit population of Nunavik, Northern Quebec. One of the objectives of the childhood pneumococcal vaccination program is to reduce OM burden. The program was implemented in 2002, and 7-, 10-, and 13-valent conjugate vaccines were used sequentially, with doses offered at 2, 4, 6 and 12-18 months, respectively.
   Objective: To assess the prevalence of middle ear abnormalities at age 5 years in relation with exposure to different pneumococcal conjugate vaccines.
   Methods: Immunization cards and audiology screening tests at age 5 years of children born in 1994-2010 were reviewed. Children were classified according to the vaccine schedule recommended for their birth cohort or to the vaccines they actually received. Log-linked binomial regression models were used to assess the relative abnormalities risk according to different vaccination schedules.
   Results: Among 3517 children with complete documentation, the prevalences of minor and major abnormalities were 29% and 18%, respectively. Minor abnormalities frequency was higher in unvaccinated children (34%) and lower in children vaccinated with PCV7 (22%), PCV7 + PCV10 (17%), PCV10 (15%) and PCV10 + PCV13 (18%). No substantial differences among vaccine schedules were observed for major abnormalities.
   Conclusions: Pneumococcal conjugate vaccination was associated with a decreased frequency of middle ear abnormalities although no effect was seen for major abnormalities which may be trigger by OM with early onset. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The three encephalitic alphaviruses, western, eastern, and Venezuelan equine encephalitis viruses (WEEV, EEEV, and VEEV) are potential biothreat agents due to high infectivity through aerosol exposure, ease of production in large amounts, and relative stability in the environment. Currently, there is no licensed vaccine for human use to these three encephalitic alphaviruses, and efforts to move vaccine candidates forward into clinical trials have not been successful. In this study, the modified vaccinia Ankara-Bavarian Nordic (MVA-BN (R)) vaccine platform was used to construct and produce three monovalent recombinant MVA-BN-based encephalitic alphavirus vaccines, MVA-BN-W, MVA-BN-E, and MVA-BN-V. Additionally, a MVA-BN-based construct was designed to produce antigens against all three alphaviruses, the trivalent vaccine MVA-BN-WEV. The protective efficacy of these vaccines was evaluated in vivo. Female BALB/c mice were immunized with two doses of each monovalent MVA-BN-based alpha virus vaccine, a mixture of the three monovalent vaccines, MVA-BN-W + E + V, or the trivalent vaccine MVA-BN-WEV at a four-week interval. Two weeks after the booster immunization, the mice were instilled intranasally with 5 x 10(3) to 1 x 10(4) plaque forming units of WEEV, EEEV, or VEEV. All mice immunized with monovalent vaccines survived the respective virus challenge without any signs of illness or weight loss, while all the control mice died. The triple mixture of vaccines or the trivalent vaccine also provided 90 to 100% protection to the mice against WEEV and VEEV challenges, and 60% to 90% protection against EEEV challenge. These data suggest that each monovalent MVA-BN-W, MVA-BN-E, and MVA-BN-V is a potential vaccine candidate against respective encephalitic alphavirus and the three monovalent vaccines can be given in a mixture (MVA-BN-W + E + V) or the trivalent vaccine MVA-BN-WEV can serve as a true multivalent vaccine without significantly reducing efficacy against WEEV and VEEV despite slightly reduced efficacy against EEEV challenge.

TI Midwives' perceptions of vaccines and their role as vaccinators: The
   emergence of a new immunization corps
SO VACCINE
LA English

AB Background: In France, midwives have recently been authorized to administer various vaccines to women (including pregnant women), newborns, and their family members. This is expected to enhance vaccine coverage. However, the French high level of vaccine hesitancy is also observed in some healthcare workers. We thus aimed to determine the perceptions of French midwives concerning vaccines.
   Methods: We distributed an anonymous online questionnaire between September and December 2017, targeting midwives who were still in training or working in the public or private sector.
   Results: A total of 917 questionnaires were analyzed (median age 26 years). Almost half of participants (44.5%) were students. On a scale of 0-100, the median perception of the usefulness, safety, and trust of vaccinations were 92, 80, and 85, respectively. The mean scores of students were significantly higher for each perception, whereas in professional midwives, age and perceptions were negatively correlated. When asked whether there were scientific, philosophical, or religious arguments not to vaccinate, 83.2%, 69.8%, and 77.8% of participants disagreed, respectively. The vast majority (91.6%) was very or mostly favorable to the pertussis vaccine after delivery, but only around half (51.5%) to the influenza vaccine during pregnancy; those favorable to the pertussis vaccine were younger. A high proportion of participants (88.3%) considered that midwives were in a good position to vaccinate, with this proportion being even higher among students.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that the recent authorization regarding vaccine administration will result in better vaccine coverage of pregnant women and their families by midwives. The better perceptions of younger participants are also encouraging. However, the level of trust in vaccinations (only 80.1%) and the low number of participants favorable to the influenza vaccine during pregnancy suggest that initial and continuous training should be reinforced.

AB Here, we report a dual-route vaccination approach for plague, able to induce a rapid response involving systemic and mucosal immunity, whilst also providing ease of use in those resource-poor settings most vulnerable to disease outbreaks. This novel vaccine (VypVaxDuo) comprises the recombinant F1 and V proteins in free association. VypVaxDuo has been designed for administration via a sub-cutaneous priming dose followed by a single oral booster dose and has been demonstrated to induce early onset immunity 14 days after the primary immunisation; full protective efficacy against live organism challenge was achieved in Balb/c mice exposed to 2 x 10(4) median lethal doses of Yersinia pestis Co92, by the sub-cutaneous route at 25 days after the oral booster immunisation. This dual-route vaccination effectively induced serum IgG and serum and faecal IgA, specific for F1 and V, which constitute two key virulence factors in Y. pestis, and is therefore suitable for further development to prevent bubonic plague and for evaluation in models of pneumonic plague. This is an essential requirement for control of disease outbreaks in areas of the world endemic for plague and is supported further by the observed exceptional stability of the primary vaccine formulation in vialled form under thermostressed conditions (40 degrees C for 29 weeks, and 40 degrees C with 75% relative humidity for 6 weeks), meaning no cold chain for storage or distribution is needed.
   In clinical use, the injected priming dose would be administered on simple rehydration of the dry powder by means of a dual barrel syringe, with the subsequent single booster dose being provided in an enteric-coated capsule suitable for oral self-administration.

AB Efficient utilization of lignite for power generation as well as development of solar-coal hybrid energy conversion systems are being aggressively researched currently. This paper proposed a novel solar-lignite hybrid power generation incorporating a lignite pre-drying, in which the solar energy collected from the flat plate collectors were beneficially utilised to drive the pre-drying process using air as the drying medium, upgrading the lignite caloric value, increasing the boiler heat flux and correspondingly boosting the electric power output. The models of energy, exergy and economics calculations for the proposed system were developed to assess the overall system thermal efficiencies as well as the net economic benefit. The graphical exergy analyses of the lignite combustion and solar-driven pre-drying processes were also performed. The net solar-to-electricity conversion efficiency as well as the cost of the solar generated electric power were computed to evaluate the solar utilization effectiveness. The results of the detailed thermodynamic and economic analyses showed that the proposed system can produce additional 29.6 MW net electric power with the overall energy and exergy efficiencies improvement of 0.5 and 1.6 percentage points, respectively, as 57.1 MW solar thermal energy is introduced. The cost of the solar generated electric power can be as low as $0.035/(kW.h) and the net annual benefits of the proposed system can reach $36.4 M, or even reach $95.7 M when the proposed system is considered as a carbon dioxide mitigation contributor.

AB This paper examines thermohydraulic performance of a spiral heat exchanger operated with the water-alumina nanofluid under turbulent flow regime. The hot water flows in one side while the cold nanofluid flows inside the other side of the heat exchanger. The effects of Reynolds number, mass flow rate, nanoparticle concentration and gap between the plates on the convective heat transfer coefficient, pumping power, overall heat transfer coefficient as well as effectiveness of the heat exchanger are evaluated. The average heat flux enhances with the increase of concentration and Reynolds number, while reduces by increasing the gap magnitude. Moreover, convective heat transfer coefficient and overall heat transfer coefficient enhance with increasing Reynolds number and concentration. Thereby, the convective heat transfer coefficient increases about 134.4% with increase of Reynolds number from 4000 to 11,000 at concentration of 2%, while it enhances almost 26.3% with increment of the concentration from 0 to 5% at Reynolds number of 10,000. The pumping power intensifies by increasing either concentration or Reynolds number, and at higher Reynolds numbers, the effect of concentration on the pumping power becomes more noticeable. Moreover, the pumping power intensifies by decreasing the gap, and this augmentation is more significant at higher concentration. Based on constant mass flow rate, however, an optimum concentration is obtained in which maximum heat transfer occurs. Meanwhile, the pumping power decreases by increasing the concentration at a constant mass flow rate. Furthermore, the effectiveness enhances by increasing the Reynolds number and reducing the gap.

AB In recent decades, many scientific works have been carried out to accomplish innovative solutions to achieve new resources for fresh water or improve the exploitation of current water resources. One of these new resources is the water vapor content of air. The objective of this study is to analyze the production of liquid water from atmospheric water vapor with assisted of a refrigeration cycle. The evaporator of this cycle will be as the cool surface and so the dehumidifier of the system that produces fresh water. In this study, a computer program was also developed to carry on a flexible thermodynamic model for a gas compression refrigeration cycle exclusively for fresh water production. The amount of water production and energy intensity under different climate conditions are analyzed. Despite most of previous studies, it has been tried to provide more real working conditions and some simplifying assumptions have been avoided. A case study is carried out based on ambient temperature and humidity intervals of system's best performance. The results show that a residential size of the system can produce 22-26 1/day fresh water while energy intensity is between 220 and 300 Wh/l. Since the proposed system can work without any brine discharging and environmentally friendly, a comparison of this method with other desalination technologies has been carried out, as well.

AB The growing number of e-commerce orders is leading to increased risk management to prevent default in payment. Default in payment is the failure of a customer to settle a bill within 90 days upon receipt. Frequently, credit scoring (CS) is employed to identify customers' default probability. CS has been widely studied, and many computational methods have been proposed. The primary aim of this work is to develop a CS model to replace the pre-risk check of the e-commerce risk management system Risk Solution Services (RSS), which is currently one of the most used systems to estimate customers' default probability. The pre-risk check uses data from the order process and includes exclusion rules and a generic CS model. The new model is supposed to replace the whole pre-risk check and has to work both in isolation and in integration with the RSS main risk check. An application of genetic programming (GP) to CS is presented in this paper. The model was developed on a real-world dataset provided by a well-known German financial solutions company. The dataset contains order requests processed by RSS. The results show that GP outperforms the generic CS model of the pre-risk check in both classification accuracy and profit. GP achieved competitive classificatory accuracy with several state-of-the-art machine learning methods, such as logistic regression, support vector machines and boosted trees. Furthermore, the GP model can be used in combination with the RSS main risk check to create a model with even higher discriminatory power. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The integration of possibility distribution into hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set (HFLTS) adds an extra dimension to individual opinion approximation process and significantly leads to enhanced data quality and reliability. However, aggregation of HFLTS possibility distributions involves merely associated possibilities of linguistic terms without taking into account all possible combinations of individual linguistic opinions. Therefore, computing with HFLTS possibility distributions in such a way has a high possibility of distorting final decisions due to loss of information. The introduction of hesitant 2-tuple linguistic term set (H2TLTS), which technically includes the HFLTS as a special case, offers us a different point of view in consolidating the aggregation process of HFLTSs. Due to the resemblance with H2TLTS, the alternative explantation of HFLTS, i.e., possibility distribution, can be analogously adapted to the theory of H2TLTS. By means of a conceptually simple recasting of HFLTS possibility distribution into a unified framework for H2TLTS possibility distribution with the development of possibilistic 2-tuple linguistic pair (P2TLP) concept, we develop a novel two-stage aggregation paradigm for HFLTS possibility distributions. At the first stage, the initial aggregation takes all possible combinations of P2TLPs in separate HFLTS possibility distributions together to generate an aggregated set of P2TLPs. Building on that, the subsequent stage proposes a similarity measure-based agglomerative hierarchical clustering (SM-AggHC) algorithm to reduce the cardinality of the aggregate set under consideration. The centroid approach combined with the normalization process finally guarantees the aggregation outcomes to be operated as H2TLTS possibility distributions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB High-utility sequential pattern mining (HUSPM) is the task of discovering all sequential patterns in a sequence database whose utility values are equal to or greater than a given minimum utility threshold. HUSPM has become increasingly important in many real-world data mining applications, such as market basket data analysis, weblog mining, and bio-medical gene data analysis, which considers co-occurrence values and quantity, utility (e.g., profit or cost) and time. Current approaches in the literature for HUSPM use the utility matrix to store a sequence database in the memory. Unfortunately, the utility matrix consumes a large amount of main memory. To address this issue, we introduce a pure array structure that reduces the memory consumption when compared to the utility matrix. In addition, HUSPM is also challenged with the downward closure property (DCP) to prune the search space. Recently, HUSPM algorithms have used the upper bound of utility values as the DCP. However, it is usually higher than the actual utility of patterns. Thus, these algorithms may generate many candidate patterns. The large search space leads to poor performance due to excessive runtime and memory usage. One of the reasons is the number of candidate patterns is proportional to the number of requisite projected database scans for calculating their actual utilities. In this paper, we present a novel pruning strategy that efficiently prunes non-HUSPs and significantly reduces the search space compared to the state-of-the-art HUS-Span algorithm. Moreover, we propose a parallel strategy to speed up the mining process. Then, we propose two algorithms which are the pure Array structure for High-utility Sequential (AHUS) pattern mining and AHUS parallel mining (AHUS-P). The AHUS-P algorithm uses shared memory to parallelize the mining process. It concurrently identifies HUSPs based on the advantages of the multi-core processor architecture. The experimental results show that AHUS and AHUS-P can efficiently and effectively discover all HUSPs. Both the proposed algorithms outperform the state-of-the-art HUS-Span algorithm in terms of runtime, memory usage, and scalability for all experimental datasets. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Along with the rapid growth of computer networks comes the need for automating management functions to prevent errors in decision-making and reduce the cost of ordinary operations. Software-defined networking (SDN) is an emergent paradigm that aims to support next-generation networks through its flexible and powerful management mechanisms. Although SDN provides greater control over traffic flow, its security and availability remain a challenge. The major contribution of this paper is to present an SDN-based ecosystem that monitors network traffic and proactively detects anomalies which may impair proper network functioning. When an anomalous event is recognized, the proposal conducts a more active analysis to inspect irregularities at the network traffic flow level. Detecting such problems quickly is essential to take appropriate countermeasures. In this manner, the potential for centralized network monitoring based on SDN with OpenFlow is addressed in order to evaluate mitigation policies against threats. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed ecosystem succeeds in achieving higher detection rates compared to other approaches. In addition, the performance analysis shows that our approach can efficiently contribute to the network's resilience. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is swiftly gaining popularity as a way to train Single hidden Layer Feed forward Networks (SLFN) for its attractive properties. ELM is a fast learning network with remarkable generalization performance. Although ELM generally can outperform traditional gradient descent-based algorithms such as Backpropagation, its performance can be highly affected by the random selection of the input weights and hidden biases of SLFN. Moreover, ELM networks tend to have more hidden neurons due to this random selection. In this paper, we propose a new model that uses Competitive Swarm Optimizer (CSO) to optimize the values of the input weights and hidden neurons of ELM. Two versions of ELM are considered: the classical ELM and the regularized version. The goal of the model is to increase the generalization performance, stabilize the classifier, and to produce more compact networks by reducing the number of neurons in the hidden layer. The proposed model is experimented based on 15 medical classification problems. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model can achieve better generalization performance with smaller number of hidden neurons and with higher stability. In addition, it requires much less training time compared to other metaheuristic based ELMs. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper develops a three-step customer clustering based approach to solve two-echelon location routing problems with time windows. A bi-objective model minimizing costs and maximizing customer satisfaction is formulated along with an innovative measurement function to rank optimal solutions. The proposed methodology is a knowledge-based approach which considers customers locations and purchase behaviors, discovers similar characteristics among them through clustering, and applies exponential smoothing method to forecast periodic customers demands. We introduce a Modified Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (M-NSGA-II) to simultaneously locate logistics facilities, allocate customers, and optimize the vehicle routing network. Different from many existing version of NSGA-II, our algorithm applies partial-mapped crossover as genetic operator, instead of simulated binary crossover, in order to properly handle chromosomes. The initial population is generated through a nodes scanning algorithm which eliminates sub-tours. Finally, to demonstrate the applicability of our mathematical model and approach, we conduct two empirical studies on generated benchmarks and the distribution network of a company in Chongqing city, China. Further comparative analyses with multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) and multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm indicate that M-NSGA-II performs better in terms of solution quality and computation time. Results also support that: (1) the formation of clusters containing highly similar customers improves service reliability, and favors a productive customer relationship management; (2) considering product preference contributes to maximizing customer satisfaction degree and the effective control of inventories at each distribution center; (3) clustering, instead of helping to improve services, proves detrimental when too many groups are formed. Thus, decision makers need to conduct series of simulations to observe appropriate clustering scenarios. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, a fuzzy, closed-loop supply chain (CLSC), with one manufacturer, one retailer and one collector, is investigated. The optimal decision problem is analyzed based on a fuzzy price and sales effort dependent demand to evaluate how members decide wholesale price, collection rate, retail price, and sales effort under different decision-making structures. Six game theory models are established and optimal solutions are extracted and compared by applying game and fuzzy theories. According to the results, collaboration between a manufacturer and retailer is favorable for both customers and the chain as a whole; the most effective model for collecting used products is collaboration between the manufacturer and collector. Finally, a practical, new channel coordination scheme is explored to match the performance of a decentralized CLSC to that of a centralized CLSC. The results illustrate that the proposed contract can effectively coordinate decentralized CLSCs. It is also beneficial from both consumer and environmental perspectives. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Over the past decade, converging evidence from diverse studies has demonstrated that sleep is closely associated with the mental and physical health, quality of life, and safety. Visual sleep scoring provides an initial and tangible illustration of how the brain wave changes across different sleep stages. The main objective of the present study is to design an accurate and robust computer-assisted sleep stage scoring system using single-channel EEG signal by proposing a novel time domain feature named Statistical Behavior of Local Extrema (SBLE). SBLE provides a profound understanding of hidden dynamics of EEG signals by quantifying and symbolizing its local extrema information, extracting and defining various patterns, and statistical analysis of extracted patterns. First, each EEG segment was decomposed into 6 frequency sub bands (i.e., low-delta, high-delta, theta, alpha, sigma, and beta). Next, SBLE features were separately computed from each sub-band. Then, an optimal feature set with a high rate of accuracy was selected using a supervised Multi-Cluster/Class Feature Selection (MCFS) algorithm. Finally, the selected features were fed to a multi-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification purposes. The benchmark Sleep-EDF dataset and DREAMS Subject Database were employed to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework. The average (+/- variance) accuracy rates were 90.6 +/- 4.2%, 91.8 +/- 5.0%, 92.8 +/- 3.3%, 94.5 +/- 3.4%, 97.9 +/- 1.4% for six-stage to two-stage sleep classification on Sleep-EDF dataset, respectively. Besides, its performance on DREAMS Subjects Database was also promising in term of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and Cohen's Kappa coefficient. Experimental results suggest that the proposed methodology can precisely solve the multi-class sleep stage classification problem by presenting an innovative symbolic approach similar to physician's point of view.

AB Recent technological advancements provide a level of mobility never seen before to modern societies. Sustaining today's economy and societies depend on maintaining this mobility. However, this mobility also causes undesirable effects, especially in high urban population areas. Even though, higher priority is given to public transport in metropolitan areas, road network is still an important part of everyday commute and should be planned and managed with great care. In this study, we propose an optimisation methodology that would help the traffic authorities to better predict the results of strategic management decisions in a realistic traffic model. We formulate a bi-level multi-objective traffic optimisation model with a sustainability perspective. The upper level of the proposed model considers the traffic authority's management strategies while the lower level considers the traffic users' decisions. The lower level is modelled using the Stochastic User Equilibrium since it allows more realistic results than the deterministic one. A case study is provided to illustrate the proposed model. The proposed methodology provides an avenue for understanding the trade-offs among conflicting objectives and for designing an environmentally and socially sustainable transportation system. More importantly, it builds the foundation for an intelligent traffic management decision support system. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Quick and simple analytical methodology has been developed for the measurement of patulin in apple juice by combining single-drop liquid-liquid-liquid microextraction with isotope dilution ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. After systematic parameters optimization, the whole sample pretreatment only consisted of single extraction that consumed 1.5 mL ethyl acetate. While, other methods usually needed complicated pretreatment, including extraction, purification, evaporation and redissolution. This sample pretreatment method could greatly lower the interferences from sugar-rich matrix, and the limit of detection was 0.5 mu g/L and limit of quantification was 2 mu g/L in apple juice. Moreover, linear range covered three orders of magnitude from 2 to 2000 mu g/L. The proposed method is promising for patulin extraction and detection in apple juice, which will opens a new perspective in the enrichment of trace contaminations in high sugar complex matrix.

AB The main objective of this study is to develop an efficient and environmentally gentle process for production of trans-free plastic fats. To acheive this, the core-shell structured magnetic composites were prepared, and then imidazole-based ionic liquids (ILs) were covalently grafted on the magnetic composites. Thereafter, Candida rugosa lipase was immobilized on the magnetic IL-functionalized composites. The immobilized lipase could be facilely separated using an external magnetic filed. With the magnetic biocatalyst, enzymatic interesterifications of solid palm stearin and liquid rice bran oil blends were performed at 45 degrees C. It was shown that the total fatty acid (FA) compositions of the binary blends were almost unchanged after the interesterifications, whereas the FA positional distribution and triacylglycerol species were significantly varied. As compared with the physical blends, the interesterified products had a lower slip melting point, and the interesterification could result in an obvious change in the microstructure of the final products.

AB As hydrolysis of carotenoid esters is believed to be highly efficient in vivo, their insufficient hydrolysis in in vitro-digestion models, particularly, regarding zeaxanthin diesters, is a current issue. Therefore, in this study, several factors related to the enzymatic hydrolysis were investigated in an adapted version of the standardized INFO-GEST in vitro-digestion model, using zeaxanthin dipalmitate (ZDP) as a substrate. The results showed that pancreatic lipase was able to hydrolyze ZDP, whereas carboxyl ester lipase (CEL) substantially contributed to ZDP cleavage. Replacement of commonly used porcine with bovine bile extracts and the substitution of coffee creamer for soybean oil at identical fat contents both significantly improved hydrolysis efficiency and bioaccessibility of total zeaxanthin to better mimic in vivo conditions. Thus, bile and lipids selection for in vitro digestion of carotenoid esters was crucial. The combined use of coffee creamer, pancreatin, CEL, and bovine bile led to the highest hydrolysis efficiency of 29.5%.

TI Development of loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assays for
   the rapid detection of allergic peanut in processed food

ID IDENTIFICATION; VIRUS
AB Peanut is a widely and common used in many cuisines around the world. However, peanut is also one of the most important food allergen for causing anaphylactic reaction. To prevent allergic reaction, the best way is to avoid the food allergen or food containing allergic ingredient such as peanut before food consuming. Thus, to efficient and precisely detect the allergic ingredient, peanut or related product, is essential and required for maintain consumer's health or their interest. In this study, a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay was developed for the detection of allergic peanut using specifically designed primer sets. Two sets of the specific LAMP primers respectively targeted the internal transcribed sequence 1 (ITS1) of nuclear ribosomal DNA sequence regions and the ara h1 gene sequence of Arachia hypogeae (peanut) were used to address the application of LAMP for detecting peanut in processed food or diet. The results demonstrated that the identification of peanut using the newly designed primers for ITS 1 sequence is more sensitive rather than primers for sequence of Ara h1 gene when performing LAMP assay. Besides, the sensitivity of LAMP for detecting peanut is also higher than the traditional PCR method. These LAMP primers sets showed high specificity for the identification of the peanut and had no cross-reaction to other species of nut including walnut, hazelnut, almonds, cashew and macadamia nut. Moreover, when minimal 0.1% peanuts were mixed with other nuts ingredients at different ratios, no any cross-reactivity was evident during performing LAMP. Finally, genomic DNAs extracted from boiled and steamed peanut were used as templates; the detection of peanut by LAMP was not affected and reproducible. As to this established LAMP herein, not only can peanut ingredients be detected but commercial foods containing peanut can also be identified. This assay will be useful and potential for the rapid detection of peanut in practical food markets.

AB Starch was isolated from the kernels of jackfruit, longan, loquat, litchi, and mango fruits, which contained approximately 56, 59, 71, 53, and 64% starch, respectively, indicating that these fruit kernels are good starch sources. The structural and functional properties of these isolated starches were investigated and compared. The starches had irregular, truncated, spherical, and elliptical shapes with central hila and exhibited different sizes, with mango starch being the largest and jackfruit and longan starches being the smallest. The five starches had similar amylose contents but exhibited significantly different crystalline properties including crystalline type, relative crystallinity, short-range ordered structure, and lamellar intensity. Among the five starches, the jackfruit and loquat starches had the highest and lowest gelatinization temperature and enthalpy, respectively, and the litchi and mango starches had the highest and lowest pasting viscosity, respectively. The longan and loquat starches were more susceptible to enzyme hydrolysis than the other starches.

AB Milk proteins (especially caseins) are widely accepted as good vehicle for the delivery of various bioactive compounds including minerals. Succinylation is one of the most acceptable chemical modification techniques to enhance the mineral binding ability of caseins. Addition of minerals to succinylated proteins may alter their physicochemical and biochemical properties. Physicochemical characteristics of succinylated sodium caseinate (S. NaCN)-mineral (iron/zinc) complexes were elucidated. Chromatographic behaviour and fluorescence intensity confirmed the structural modification of S. NaCN upon binding with minerals. The bound mineral from protein complexes showed significantly higher (P < 0.05) in vitro bioavailability (mineral uptake) than mineral salts in Caco-2 cells. Also, iron bound S. NaCN showed higher cellular ferritin formation than iron in its free form. These mineral bound protein complexes with improved bioavailability could safely replace inorganic fortificants in various functional food formulations.

AB A method for the non-targeted detection of paprika adulteration was developed using Fourier transform mid-infrared (FT-MIR) spectroscopy and one-class soft independent modelling of class analogy (OCSIMCA). One-class models based on commercially available paprika powders were developed and optimised to provide > 80% sensitivity by external validation. The performances of the established models for adulteration detection were tested by predicting spiked paprika samples with various types of fraudulent material and levels of adulterations including 1% (w/w) Sudan I, 1% (w/w) Sudan IV, 3% (w/w) lead chromate, 3% (w/w) lead oxide, 5% (w/w) silicon dioxide, 10% (w/w) polyvinyl chloride, and 10% (w/w) gum arabic. Further, the influence of data preprocessing on the model performance was investigated. Relationship between classification results and data preprocessing was identified and specificity > 80% was achieved for all adulterants by applying different preprocessing methods including standard normal variate (SNV), first and second derivatives, smoothing, and combinations thereof.

AB alpha-Glucosidase is an enzyme that plays a key role in raising blood sugar level and is considered a good target for developing drugs to treat type 2 diabetes. This study was performed to evaluate the inhibition of the catalytic reaction of alpha-glucosidase by minor phlorotannin derivatives (1-5) from Ecklonia cava. These derivatives demonstrated inhibitory activity, with IC50 values ranging from 2.3 +/- 0.1 to 59.8 +/- 0.8 mu M. Among the phlorotannins identified, compounds 2 and 3-5 were revealed to be non-competitive and competitive inhibitors, respectively. Furthermore, a fluorescence-quenching study of receptor-ligand binding was performed to calculate the kinetic parameters (Ksv, Kq, and K). These signal data indicated a 1:1 ratio of ligand-receptor binding. The binding conformations of the phlorotannin ligands were visually solved through molecular simulation. In conclusion, these minor phlorotannins may serve as alpha-glucosidase inhibitors targeted for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.

AB Effects of cellulase hydrolysis, acid treatment and particle size distribution on the structure, physicochemical and functional properties of coconut cake dietary fiber (DCCDF) were studied. Results showed that both the cellulase hydrolysis and acid treatment contributed to the structural modification of DCCDF as evident from XRD, FT-IR and SEM analysis. Moreover, the cellulase hydrolysis enhanced soluble carbohydrate content, water holding capacity (WHC) and swelling capacity (WSC), alpha-amylase inhibition activity (alpha-AAIR), glucose dialysis retardation index (GDRI) and cation-exchange capacity (CEC) of DCCDF; but it had undesirable effects on colour, oil holding capacity (OHC) and emulsifying capacity (EC). On other hand, acid treatment decreased the WHC, WSC and GDRI, but improved the colour, CEC, OHC and emulsion stability of DCCDF. Furthermore, the WHC, WSC and EC of DCCDF increased as the particle size reduced from 250 to 167 mu m, while the GDRI, OHC, alpha-AAIR and emulsion stability decreased with decreasing particle size.

AB Three polysaccharide fractions were isolated from blackberry wine. The crude extract BWPs was obtained with ethanol precipitation and freeze-thawing process, it was then submitted to Fehling treatment, giving soluble BWPFs and insoluble BWPFp fractions. These fractions were characterized by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). Major polysaccharides were identified for each fraction: mannan, type II arabinogalactan and type I rhamnogalacturonan for BWPs, a mannan formed by a major chain of alpha-Manp(1 -> 6)-linked units, O-2 substituted with alpha-D-Manp(1 -> 2)-linked side chains for BWPFp and a AG II formed by a major chain of ss-D-Galp(1 -> 3)-linked, substituted at O-6 by side chains of the ss-D-Galp (1. 6)-linked, which then are substituted at O-3 by non-reducing units of alpha-L-Araf and a RG I, formed by [-> 4)-alpha- D-GalpA-(1 -> 2)-alpha-L-Rhap-(1 -> ](n) for BWPFs. Anti-inflammatory effects of polysaccharide fractions were evaluated in RAW 264.7 cells. Fractions markedly reduced nitric oxide (NO) and pro-inflammatory cytokine production (TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta) in LPS-treated cells.

AB A new fluorescent probe 6-(2,4-dinitrophenoxy)-2-naphthonitrile (probe 1) was designed and synthesized for the selective detection of hydrogen sulfide (H2S). The addition of H2S to a solution of probe 1 resulted in a marked fluorescence turn-on alongside a visual color change from colorless to light yellow. Importantly, this distinct color response indicated that probe 1 could be used as a visual sensor for H2S. Moreover, probe 1 was successfully used as a signal tool to determine the H2S levels in beer and red wine.

AB In order to develop an accurate and precise determination method based on solid phase extraction of Pb(II) in food and water samples, a hybrid monolithic column based on layered double hydroxides (LDHs) nanosheets-alginate hydrogel has been synthesized. Combining the advantages of porous 3D framework of hydrogel with selective adsorption of LDHs toward Pb(II), the hydrogel-based hybrid monolithic column shows enhanced enrichment selectivity and efficiency for target ions. Effects of hydrogel composition, pH, concentration and type of eluent, sample volume, and interfering ions on the recoveries of the analytes were also investigated. Under the optimal experiment conditions of method, the limit of detection, preconcentration factor and precision as RSD% are found to be 0.39 mu g L-1, 53.7 and 2.65%, respectively. Trace Pb(II) can be quantitatively preconcentrated at pH 6.0 with recoveries >97%. Finally, the method was successfully verified by analyzing spiked Pb2+ in water and drinking samples.

AB The aim of this study was to use different enzyme mixtures to investigate the influence of peptide characteristics and taste of protein hydrolysates from bovine muscle and porcine plasma. Minced beef and porcine plasma were hydrolysed using 10 food-grade enzymes, including Protease A, Protease P, ProteAX, Flavourzyme, Alcalase, Papain, Bromelain, Protamex, Neutrase and Sumizyme BNP-L. The relationship between degree of hydrolysis (DH), molecular weight (MW) distribution, enzyme specificity, and sensory characteristics of hydrolysates were investigated. The results demonstrated that Protease A, a mixture of endo-and exo-peptidases, was the optimal protease to generate hydrolysates with low bitterness. Endopeptidases (Papain and Bromelain) elicited bitter taste of protein hydrolysates. A positive correlation was suggested between umami taste and MW distribution (<0.5 kDa), while bitterness was positively correlated with MW distribution (0.5-1 kDa). Overall, hydrolysis with enzyme preparations containing endo-and exo-peptidases was effective to reduce bitterness of hydrolysates.

AB Gas chromatography/olfactometry-associated taste (GC/O-AT) analysis combined with mass spectrometry allowed identification of odorant compounds associated with taste attributes (sweet, salty, bitter and sour) in a multi-fruit juice. Nine compounds were selected for their odor-associated sweetness enhancement in a multi-fruit juice odor context using Olfactoscan and for their odor-induced sweet taste enhancement in sucrose solution and sugar-reduced fruit juice through sensory tests. Sweetness of the fruit juice odor was significantly enhanced by methyl 2-methylbutanoate, ethyl butanoate, ethyl 2-methylbutanoate and linalool; sweet perception was significantly enhanced in 7% sucrose solution by ethyl 2-methylbutanoate, furaneol and.-decalactone, and in 32% sugar-reduced fruit juice by ethyl 2-methylbutanoate. GC/O-AT analysis is a novel, efficient approach to select odorants associated with a given taste. The further screening of taste-associated odorants by Olfactoscan helps to identify the most efficient odorants to enhance a target taste perception and may be used to find new ways to modulate taste perception in foods and beverages.

AB An accurate, fast, economic and simple method to determine carotenoids, tocopherols, retinol and cholesterol in lyophilised samples of ovine milk, muscle and liver and raw samples of fat, which are difficult to lyophilise, is sought. Those analytes have been studied in animal tissues to trace forage feeding and unhealthy contents. The sample treatment consisted of mild overnight saponification, liquid-liquid extraction, evaporation with vacuum evaporator and redissolution. The quantification of the different analytes was performed by the use of ultra-high performance liquid chromatography with diode-array detector for carotenoids, retinol and cholesterol and fluorescence detector for tocopherols. The retention times of the analytes were short and the resolution between analytes was very high. The limits of detection and quantification were very low. This method is suitable for all the matrices and analytes and could be adapted to other animal species with minor changes.

AB A simple, cheap and efficient method for pre-concentrating and separating Zn(II) ions from aqueous solutions and real samples has been designed. The method was implemented in a prototype featuring interchangeable chromatography-column-like cartridges, filled with meso-porous silica nanostructures, allowing easy exchange of the type and quantity of the sorbent. The adsorbents inside the column are held in place by means of porous polymer nano-fibre membranes. The effects of various parameters on the adsorption of Zn(II) ions from aqueous solutions were investigated. Maximal adsorption (similar to 99%) was found for Zn(II) ions amongst a mixture of Cu(II), Co(II), Ni(II), Ag(I), Au(III), Pd(II) and Pb(II) in aqueous solution. The procedure was tested for pre-concentrating and determining traces of zinc in real samples of meat, fish and hen marketed in Tehran. A desorption process using 0.5 mol L-1 HCl as eluent, showed similar to 97% recovery of the Zn(II) ions adsorbed on the MSMPP sorbent.

AB To enhance the application of transglutaminase (TGase) in processing and preserving of frozen surimi, the mechanism that enhances surimi gelation induced by TGase after short-term freezing was investigated. Gel properties and cross-linking extent of surimi gels increased when surimi was frozen at -18 degrees C for 5-7 days. However when storage time exceeded 10 days, textural properties and water-holding capacity decreased significantly. Moreover, the difference of breaking force and hardness between surimi gels with and without TGase reached the maximum after 3-5 days of frozen storage. Free amino content of myosin increased during the first 7 days, and TGase activity increased significantly during the first 3 days. Short-term frozen storage unfolded myosin structure, decreased a-helix content, and exposed hydrophobic patches, which promoted cross-linking reactions and intermolecular hydrophobic interactions. This study provides some new ideas for the processing, storage and transport of frozen surimi and manufacture of frozen surimi-based products.

AB Over 3 billion people share a diet consisting mainly of rice, which may contain significant amounts of arsenic. Because the toxicity of arsenic is dependent on its chemical form and that it may be in a form that is not bio-accessible (i.e. dissolved in the gastrointestinal tract) and can thus not become bio-available (i.e. end up in the blood stream, where it may exert its toxic effect), the bio-accessibility of arsenic was determined in thirteen different types of rice. The effects of washing and cooking were also studied. The total concentration of arsenic ranged from 93 to 989 mu g kg(-1) and its bio-accessibility ranged from 16 to 93%. Cooking only changed arsenic speciation in a few cases. However, simply washing rice with arsenic-free water before cooking removed 3-43% of the arsenic, resulting in all the rice tested except the most contaminated one being safe to consume by adults.

AB Temperature fluctuations are a key factor in the development of prediction models using near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). In the present study, this influence has been investigated and a methodology has been proposed to reduce the effect of sample temperature on NIRS model prediction of the sodium content in dry-cured ham slices. Spectra were taken directly from the slices using a remote measurement probe (for non-contact analysis) at three different temperature ranges: -12 degrees C to -5 degrees C, -5 degrees C to 10 degrees C and 10 degrees C to 20 degrees C. Local and global temperature compensation methods were established. Partial-least squares (PLS) regression was used as a chemometrics tool to perform the calibrations. The results showed that local models were sensitive to changes in temperature, while a global temperature model using sample spectra over the entire temperature range showed good prediction ability, reducing the error caused by temperature fluctuations to acceptable levels for practical applications.

AB This study investigated the application of water-oil-water (W-1/O/W-2) double emulsions (DE) for yeast encapsulation and sequential inoculation of Zygosaccharomyces rouxii and Tetragenococcus halophilus in moromi stage of soy sauce fermentation with reduced NaCl and/or substitution with KCl. Z. rouxii and T. halophilus were incorporated in the internal W-1 and external W-2 phase of DE, respectively. NaCl reduction and substitution promoted T. halophilus growth to 8.88 log CFU/mL, accompanied with faster sugar depletion and enhanced lactic acid production. Reducing NaCl without substitution increased the final pH (5.49) and decreased alcohols, acids, esters, furan and phenol content. However, the application of DE resulted in moromi with similar microbiological and physicochemical characteristics to that of high-salt. Principal component analysis of GC-MS data demonstrated that the reduced-salt moromi had identical aroma profile to that obtained in the standard one, indicating the feasibility of producing low-salt soy sauce without compromising its quality.

AB The quality of zein (Z)-and zein-tannic acid (ZTA)-coated guavas was monitored throughout 12 days of storage. Coated fruit showed lower changes in terms of visual appearance, chlorophyll contents and color. Weight loss, softening, and changes in soluble solids were also decreased by the coatings. The respiration peak as well as H2O2 and superoxide dismutase activity peaks were delayed by the coatings, and the ethylene production was reduced. So, the results were consistent with a slowed down ripening of guavas by the coatings, which was probably related to lowered oxygen permeability of guava skin. ZTA coating was more effective than Z to reduce weight loss, softening, color changes, ethylene production, and oxidative stress. The higher efficiency of ZTA coating was ascribed to zein crosslinking, which probably resulted in decreased gas permeability, promoting lower respiration rates and lower ROS production, slowing down the ripening process, and extending guava stability.

AB The aim of this work was to develop a simple and rapid analytical method for the simultaneous determination of a wide range of drug residues in milk by UHPLC-MS/MS. A total of 25 typical veterinary drugs investigated belong to six families including beta-lactams, quinolones, beta-agonists, phenicols, glucocorticoids and nitrofurans. The samples were extracted by acetonitrile and defatted with n-hexane twice. Electrospray ionization and positive/negative polarity switching were utilized for the analysis of 25 veterinary drugs in a single chromatographic run. The linearity, recovery, precision and matrix effects of the method were fully validated. The intraand inter-precision were in the range of 1.7-11.1% and 2.5-10.4%, respectively. The average recoveries ranged from 65.9% to 123.5% with RSD less than 10.8% at three concentration levels. The proposed method was demonstrated to be simple, economical and reliable for the fast monitoring of these drug residues in milk samples.

AB The quality characteristics of waxy and non-waxy proso millet (Panicum miliaceum L.) are different because of their varying amylose content. Physical appearance, pasting properties, cooking and edibility were investigated in five waxy and five non-waxy proso millet varieties. The results showed that the amylose content of proso millet flour was positively correlated with peak viscosity, trough viscosity, breakdown viscosity, final viscosity, setback viscosity, peak time, and pasting temperature. The porridge made with non-waxy proso millet was thicker as compared with that of made with waxy proso millet. Cooked non-waxy proso millet was hard whereas waxy proso millet was sticky. The non-waxy proso millet contained higher resistant starch and lower rapidly digestible starch than waxy proso millet. From this study, we can conclude that quality characteristics of waxy and non-waxy proso millet are different, and this may provide an insight in food processing and commercial production of proso millet.

AB An upconversion fluorescence DNA probe which consists of aptamer-conjugated magnet nanoparticles (apt-MNPs) and complementary DNA-conjugated upconversion nanoparticles (cDNA-UCNPs) was developed to detect acetamiprid. Acetamiprid can specifically conjugate with the apt-MNPs to dissociate the cDNA-UCNPs from the apt-MNPs and resulted in reduced fluorescence intensity through an external magnet. The change of fluorescence intensity (. I) is positively related to the concentration of acetamiprid, which can be applied for the quantification of acetamiprid. Under optimal conditions, a linear detection range and detection limit are 0.89-114.18 mu g/L and 0.65 mu g/L, respectively. The probe was successfully used to detect acetamiprid in spiked paddy water, soil, pear, apple, wheat and cucumber. Average recoveries are 78.2%-103.5% with intra-day relative standard deviations (RSDs) of 2.6%-10.9% and inter-day RSDs of 4.3%-10.2%. The amounts of acetamiprid in the authentic paddy water and pear samples detected by the DNA probe are significantly correlated with that detected by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).

AB Microalgae are an interesting source of natural pigments that have valuable applications. However, further research is necessary to develop processes that allow us to achieve high levels of carotenoid recovery while avoiding degradation. This work presents a comprehensive study on the recovery of carotenoids from several microalgae genera, optimizing carotenoid extraction using alkaline saponification at various temperatures and KOH concentrations. Results show that I. galbana requires a temperature of 60 degrees C and <10% KOH, N. gaditana and K. veneficum require 60 degrees C and no saponification, P. reticulatum requires 40 degrees C and 10% KOH, T. suecica and H. pluvialis require 25 degrees C and 40% KOH while C. sp. and S. almeriensis require 80 degrees C and 40% KOH. The influence of the solvent on carotenoid recovery was also studied. In general terms, an ethanol: hexane: water (77:17: 6 v/v/v) mixture results in good yields.

AB A new UHPLC-DAD-MS method based on a Core-Shell particles column was developed to realize the rapid separation of saffron stigma metabolites (Crocus sativus L.). A single separation of 35 compounds included cis and trans-crocetin esters (crocins), cis-crocetin, trans-crocetin, kaempferol derivatives, safranal, and picrocrocin from pure saffron stigmas. This method permitted the detection of 11 picrocrocin derivatives as the typical group of compounds from saffron as well as the detection of gardenia-specific compounds as typical adulterant markers. The metabolite concentration in a Standardized Saffron Extract (SSE) was determined using the method described herein and by comparison to the ISO3632 conventional method. The safranal content was 5-150 times lower than the value of 2% that was expected via ISO3632 analyses. Using the same Core-Shell separation, geniposide detection appeared to be a relevant approach for detecting the adulteration of saffron by using gardenia.

AB Legumes offer the possibility to develop multifunctional foods with benefits for metabolic syndrome. Our objective was to study the effect of alkaline fermentation by Lactobacillus plantarum and Savinase (FLPS) as well the individual effects of both processes on peptides, phenolics and bioactivity of lentil. FLPS increased peptides and some flavonoids and enhanced antioxidant activity, inhibition of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) and intestinal maltase activities of lentil soluble fraction. Savinase contributed to peptide release, ACE inhibitory and antioxidant activities of lentil soluble fraction. L. plantarum affected to phenolic composition, alpha-glucosidase and lipase inhibitory activities. Mass spectrometry analysis of the most active fermented lentil subfraction allowed the identification of the main bioactive compounds. Gastrointestinal digestion of fermented lentil increased bioaccessibility of peptides and phenolics as well as antioxidant activity. FLPS enhanced the overall healthy potential of lentil offering the possibility of its use as strategy for lentil functionalization.

AB Understanding the bioactive partitioning between the phases of an emulsion system underpins strategies for improving the efficiency of bioactive protection against degradation. We analysed partitioning of beta-carotene in emulsions with various formulations in-situ using confocal Raman microscopy (CRM). The partitioning of beta-carotene into the aqueous phase of emulsions increased when whey protein isolate (WPI) was heat or high pressure-treated prior to emulsion formation. However, increasing the concentration of high pressure-treated WPI reduced the beta-carotene partitioning into the aqueous phase. Increasing the solid fat content in the carrier oil favoured the migration of beta-carotene into the aqueous phase. The use of WPI as the emulsifier resulted in a greater partitioning of beta-carotene into the aqueous phase compared to when Tween 40 was the emulsifier. This study demonstrates that partitioning of beta-carotene between the aqueous and oil phase is dependent on the characteristics of the oil phase, emulsifier type and processing.

AB Genetic diversity of 29 potato genotypes was estimated by their starch physicochemical properties and microsatellite markers. The apparent amylose content (AAC) of potato starches averaged 25.3%, ranging from 18.9 to 29.4%. Significance differences were observed in pasting and gel texture properties among potato accessions. Wide genetic diversity was also found in the gelatinization temperatures (T-o, T-p, T-c), enthalpies of gelatinization, enthalpies of retrogradation and retrogradation percentage, which had ranges of 62.2-67.6 degrees C, 66.1-71.1 degrees C, 73.5-77.4 degrees C, 17.5-21.0 J/g, 1.95-4.41 J/g, and 10.6-21.4%, respectively. AAC had significant correlation with pasting viscosities and gel hardness, but had no correlation with thermal and retrogradation properties. The grouping of the potato genotypes using 30 microsatellite markers did not correspond to that drawn using the starch physicochemical properties. Molecular analysis revealed that genotypes with interesting starch properties were distributed among three clusters. Potato starches exhibited interesting physiochemical properties could be applied in food and industrial applications.

AB Amantadine (AMD), a banned antiviral veterinary drug, is still being abused. This study developed a novel enzyme linked immunosorbent assay for the colorimetric detection of AMD involving DNA hybridization reaction and non-crosslinking gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) aggregation. Accordingly, the Primer 1-AuNPs-anti-AMD monoclonal antibody (mAb) could be captured by AMD artificial antigen on ELISA wells. Primer 2, which was complementary paired to Primer 1, was eventually added into the ELISA wells. After the hybridization reaction, the free Primer 2 in the supernatant was mixed with AuNPs and NaCl and induced a rapid color change of AuNPs. The lack of AMD in the sample resulted in capturing a substantial Primer 1-AuNPs-mAb complex and limited free Primer 2 in the supernatant. After adding NaCl, the color of AuNPs turned blue with limited Primer 2. This simple and visualized novel method had good sensitivity (0.033 mu M) and exhibited a potential application for AMD screening on site.

AB There are eight most abundant green tea catechins (GTCs) existing in four pairs of eipimers, and carbon-3 configuration represents the only steric difference within each pair. This study aimed to use a new kinetic approach to elucidate the effect of stereochemical changes on the antioxidant activity. A mixture of eight GTCs was treated by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) prepared in a series of concentrations, their relative reaction rates towards scavenging DPPH were revealed by the recently introduced parameter, i.e. D-m. The 3-R configuration in (-)-epicatechin, (-)-epigallocatechin and (-)-epigallocatechin gallate gave lower D-m values demonstrating faster kinetics as opposed to their 3-S counterparts, with the only exception of the pair of (-)-catechin gallate and (-)-epicatechin gallate in which 3-S configuration was faster. These results suggested that the kinetic approach adopted in this study could reflect the different antioxidant activity of GTCs attributed by minor steric changes.

AB In order to explore the role of macrophages in HSF1-mediated alleviation of heart failure, mice model of pressure overload-induced heart failure was established using transverse aortic constriction (TAC). Changes in cardiac function and morphology were studied in TAC and SHAM groups using ultrasonic device, tissue staining, electron microscopy, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-QPCR), and Western blotting. We found that mice in the TAC group showed evidence of impaired cardiac function and aggravation of fibrosis on ultrasonic and histopathological examination when compared to those in the SHAM group. The expressions of HSF1, LC3II/LC3I, Becline-1 and HIF-1, as well as autophagosome formation in TAC group were greater than that in SHAM group. On sub-group analyses in the TAC group, improved cardiac function and alleviation of fibrosis was observed in the HSF1 TG subgroup as compared to that in the wild type subgroup. Expressions of LC3II/LC31, Becline-1 and HIF-1, too showed an obvious increase; and increased autophagosome formation was observed on electron microscopy. Opposite results were observed in the HSF1 KO subgroup. These results collectively suggest that in the pressure overload heart failure model, HSF1 promoted formation of macrophages by inducing upregulation of HIF-1 expression, through which heart failure was ameliorated.

AB Diagnosing acute leukemia is the necessary prerequisite to treaing it. Multi-classification on the gene expression data of acute leukemia is help for diagnosing it which contains B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BALL), T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (TALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, selecting cancer causing genes is a challenging problem in performing multi-classification. In this paper, weighted gene co-expression networks are employed to divide the genes into groups. Based on the dividing groups, a new regularized multinomial regression with overlapping group lasso penalty (MROGL) has been presented to simultaneously perform multi-classification and select gene groups. By implementing this method on three-class acute leukemia data, the grouped genes which work synergistically are identified, and the overlapped genes shared by different groups are also highlighted. Moreover, MROGL outperforms other five methods on multi classification accuracy.

AB Diabetic foot ulcers are one of the most common complications of diabetes with high morbidity and mortality. Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is one of the treatment modalities that facilitates the wound healing process; however, its molecular mechanism remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism of action of NPWT in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers via measuring the tissue expression of genes related to the wound healing process. The study included 40 patients with diabetic foot ulceration, 20 of them received NPWT and the other 20 were a control group treated with advanced moist therapy. Granulation tissue biopsies were obtained before and 10 days after treatment in both groups and subjected to real-time polymerase chain reaction to measure the mRNA expression of TGF-beta 1, VEGF, TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, MMP-1, MMP-9 and TIMP-1 which are involved in the wound healing pathway. After 10 days of treatment with NPWT, the mRNA levels of IL -1 beta, TNF-alpha, MMP-1, and MMP-9 were significantly downregulated, while the levels of VEGF, TGF-beta 1 and TIMP-1 were significantly increased. Our study demonstrated that NPWT promotes wound healing in diabetic foot ulcers possibly by affecting growth factors, inflammatory cytokines, and matrix metalloproteinases.

AB Background: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified common variants at the Vascular Endothelial-Growth-Factor (VEGF) gene locus, which appear to be associated with plasma VEGF concentrations. These factors are among the major risk factors for cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome (MetS). We have investigated the association between serum VEGF concentrations and a VEGF genetic variant (rs6921438 A < G) in 852 patients with or without MetS, defined according to International-Diabetes-Federation (IDF) criteria, recruited from the Mashhad Stroke and Heart Atherosclerotic Disorders cohort and their possible relationships with cardio-metabolic risk-factors and diet.
   Methods: In total of 852 individuals, genotyping was performed using polymerase-chain-reaction and restriction-fragment-length-polymorphisms. Serum VEGF level was determined in 122 subjects using the EV 3513 cytokine biochip array. Anthropometric and biochemical characteristics, including fasting blood glucose and lipid profile evaluated by univariate and multivariate analyses. The association of the polymorphism with serum VEGF level and its interaction with dietary intake in association with the essential determinants of cardiovascular risk factors were assessed.
   Results: As would be expected, patients with MetS had markedly higher body mass index, waist-circumference, serum total cholesterol, triglyceride, hs-CRP and blood pressure, and lower concentrations of HDL-C, compared to non-MetS individuals (P < 0.05). The association between the rs6921438 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and the presence of MetS and individual features of MetS were not statistically significant. Interestingly we observed a significant association between high serum VEGF levels with the GG and GA genotypes in the individuals with MetS, compared to the wild-type genotype, which was also associated with dietary fat intake.
   Conclusion: Our findings show an association between a VEGF gene polymorphism with serum VEGF concentrations and dietary fat intake, but there was no association with the presence of MetS.

AB SERPING1 genotyping of subjects suspicious for hereditary angioedema due to C1-INH deficiency (C1-INH-HAE) is important for clinical practice as well as for research reasons. Conventional approaches towards the detection of C1-INH-HAE-associated SERPING1 variants are cumbersome and time-demanding with many pitfalls. To take advantage of the benefits of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology, we developed and validated a custom NGS platform that, by targeting the entire SERPING1 gene, facilitates genetic testing of C1-INH-HAE patients in clinical practice. In total, 135 different C1-INH-HAE-associated SERPING1 variants, out of the approximately 450 reported, along with 115 negative controls and 95 randomly selected DNA samples from affected family members of C1-INH-HAE index patients, were included in the forward and reverse validation processes of this platform. Our platform's performance, i.e. analytical sensitivity of 98.96%, a false negative rate of 1.05%, analytical specificity 100%, a false positive rate equal to zero, accuracy of 99.35%, and repeatability of 100% recommends its implementation as a first line approach for the genetic testing of C1-INH-HAE patients or as a confirmatory method. A noteworthy advantage of our platform is the concomitant detection of single nucleotide variants and copy number variations throughout the whole length of the SERPING1 gene, moreover providing information about the size and the localization of the latter. During our study, 15 novel C1-INH-HAE-related SERPING1 variants were detected.

AB Expression of the eukaryotic genome is a highly complex and tightly regulated process, and its regulation depends on interactions among cis-acting elements and transcription factors. Identification of active gene regulatory elements is key to understanding transcriptional control of biological processes including differentiation, development, proliferation, cell-type specificity, and responses to the environment. DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs) are markers of open chromatin that provide a very effective method of targeting all types of cis-regulatory elements (CREs) including enhancers, promoters, insulators, silencers, and locus control regions. With the rapid development of sequencing technologies, many genomes have been sequenced. Identification of DHSs provides the potential for further animal functional genomics research. This review reveals recent advances in the identification and analysis of DHSs in animal genomes.

   FORMATION
AB The Himalayan foreland basin is characterised by three principal sedimentary successions. These are the Subathu Group (Palaeocene-Eocene), the Murree or Dharamsala Group (Oligocene-Miocene) and the Siwalik Group (Miocene-Pleistocene). The basin was linked in the east to the Bay of Bengal through the Bengal Basin and its western part was connected to the Arabian Sea through Rajasthan and Kachchh, Gujarat. The Himalayan foothills have long been known for yielding rich mammalian fossil occurrences and significant localities in the Indian Siwaliks include Kalagarh, Ramnagar, Haritalyangar, Chandigarh and Jammu regions. The Bugti Basin and Zinda Pir area of Sulaiman Range of Pakistan were also part of the foreland basin, as Lower and Middle Siwalik fossils are known from the Vihowa and Litra formations, respectively. The Marwat Formation of Bhittani and Marwat Ranges, Pakistan have also yielded Pinjor-age vertebrate fossils. The Middle and Upper Siwalik-age fossils are also known from the Irrawaddy Formation of Myanmar, where older Pegu beds have also yielded scanty Lower Siwalik-age fossils. This faunal succession in the Irrawaddy Valley may have geologically and biogeographically belonged to the Himalayan foreland basin in the past. Additional mammalian fossils having an affinity with the Lower and Middle Siwaliks are known from the Khari Nadi Formation of Kachchh. The Bokabil Formation of Tripura also yielded scanty Lower to Middle Siwalik fossils. A younger Siwalik late Miocene assemblage is known from Piram Island of Gujarat. These areas are also part of the foreland basin. Most recently, a late Miocene suid species was discovered and reported from near Baripada, Odisha. The paper discusses the respective faunal lists of the various successions mentioned above. Finally, the paper discusses the implications of the foreland faunas. The faunas of Lower and Middle Siwaliks of foreland basin have links with Europe, Turkey, Africa and Central Asia and throw light on the uplift of the Himalaya. The post-Siwalik faunas of central and Peninsular India and Indo-Gangetic Plains have also yielded remnant Siwalik taxa, including Stegodon in-signis Elephas hysudricus and Potamochoerus theobaldi. The Kurnool Cave Fauna and Recent Fauna of India have also generic resemblance with the foreland faunas.

AB In this paper, we extend the implicit-explicit (IMEX) methods of Peer type recently developed by Lang and Hundsdorfer (2017) [16] to a broader class of two-step methods that allow the construction of super-convergent IMEX-Peer methods with A-stable implicit part. IMEX schemes combine the necessary stability of implicit and low computational costs of explicit methods to efficiently solve systems of ordinary differential equations with both stiff and non-stiff parts included in the source term. To construct super-convergent IMEX-Peer methods with favourable stability properties, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions on the coefficient matrices and apply an extrapolation approach based on already computed stage values. Optimised super-convergent IMEX-Peer methods of order s + 1 for s = 2, 3, 4 stages are given as result of a search algorithm carefully designed to balance the size of the stability regions and the extrapolation errors. Numerical experiments and a comparison to other IMEX-Peer methods are included. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID DISCONTINUOUS GALERKIN METHODS; FINITE-ELEMENT-METHOD; CONSERVATION-LAWS
AB High-resolution schemes for conservation laws need to suitably limit the numerical solution near discontinuities, in order to avoid Gibbs oscillations. The solution quality and the computational cost of such schemes strongly depend on their ability to correctly identify troubled-cells, namely, cells where the solution loses regularity. Motivated by the objective to construct a universal troubled-cell indicator that can be used for general conservation laws, we propose a new approach to detect discontinuities using artificial neural networks (ANNs). In particular, we construct a multilayer perceptron (MLP), which is trained offline using a supervised learning strategy, and thereafter used as a black-box to identify troubled-cells. The proposed MLP indicator can accurately identify smooth extrema and is independent of problem-dependent parameters, which gives it an advantage over traditional limiter-based indicators. Several numerical results are presented to demonstrate the robustness of the MLP indicator in the framework of Runge-Kutta discontinuous Galerkin schemes, and its performance is compared with the minmod limiter and the minmod-based TVB limiter.

AB Improving the plasticity of Mg alloys is an important frontier topic in the field of mechanics and materials. The influence of introduction of amorphous phase, grain size and temperature on the deformation mechanisms of nano-polycrystal Mg under tensile loading here is studied by molecular dynamics simulation method. The results indicate that the introduction of amorphous grain can improve the plasticity of the nano-polycrystal Mg due to cooperative movement of atoms in crystalline and amorphous phases. With the decrease of grain size, the plastic deformation of crystal phase in crystal-amorphous Mg-MgAl nanocomposites change from the nucleation of dislocations and growth of tensile twins to the grain boundaries glide and grains rotation, and the plastic deformation mode of amorphous phase change from the shear band dominated deformation to the homogeneous plastic deformation. The results also show that the amorphous grain plays a more and more important role during plastic deformation of Mg-MgAl nanocomposites as grain size decreases, and the deformation behavior of nanocomposites obviously depends on temperature. In addition, some quantified analysis about the deformation mechanism of nanocomposites is also presented.

AB In this study, an attempt was made to investigate the influence of immersion temperature and time of ion exchange on the microstructure and mechanical properties of chemically toughened soda-lime glass (CTG). Glass samples of 120 x 50 x 40 mm were immersed in potassium nitrate (KNO3) salt placed inside a salt bath and subjected to heating at temperatures of 450 degrees C and 500 degrees C with the immersion time varied for 4 h and 5 h for each temperature inside a muffle furnace. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was used to evaluate the microstructure of the chemically toughened glasses while tests such as hardness, flexural strength and impact strength were used to assess the mechanical properties of the chemically toughened glasses. The results obtained show that hardness value decreased as temperature and time increases with maximum hardness of 26.35 BHN for CTG(1) (450 degrees C for 4 h). The impact strength increased as temperature and time increases with maximum impact strength of 36.72 J for CTG(4) (500 degrees C for 5 h). However, the maximum flexural strength of 95.87 MPa was obtained for CTG(2) (450 degrees C for 5 h).

AB Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP)-polyethylene glycol (PEG) based polymer blend electrolyte films have been prepared by varying the Sodium methylsulfate (Me) salt, in different % ratio using solution cast technique. Various techniques i.e. ATR-FTIR, TGA, DSC and AC Impedance spectroscopy have been used to characterize the prepared samples. ATR-FTIR result shows the complexation of MeSO4Na salt with PVA-PVP polymer blend. TGA results show the thermal stability of polymeric blend electrolyte changes with MeSO4Na content in PVA-PVP based polymer blend and also formation of miscible blend. DSC analysis reveals that single glass transition temperature (T-g) and melting temperature (T-m) changes with increasing MeSO4Na content. The dielectric relaxation frequency, f(r) has been found to increase with temperature in PVA-PVP-PEG-20MeSa(4)Na. Ionic conductivity and dielectric relaxation frequency vs. 1/T plots for PVA-PVP-PEG-20MeSO(4)Na based polymeric films follows the Arrhenius behavior. The maximum conductivity of 1.67 x 10(-5)S/cm has been found for sample PVA-PVP-PEG-20MeSa(4)Na at room temperature. AC conductivity vs. frequency (Hz) curves was obtained for different PVA-PVP based polymer blend with respect to salt concentrations and temperatures. Dielectric permittivity and electric modulus of the polymeric films have been studied for various frequencies. Scaling i.e. sigma/sigma(0) vs. omega/omega(o) has been done for PVA-PVP-PEG-20MeSO(4)Na polymer blend electrolyte.

AB Dynamic damage and fracture of conductive glass are investigated using a split Hopkinson pressure bar, implemented with in situ X-ray phase contrast imaging (XPCI) and optical imaging for comparison. Quantitative comparison between X-ray and optical images demonstrates that XPCI exhibits much higher resolution in resolving micro cracks and dynamic fracture modes. Multiple predamage and fracture modes of glass samples under dynamic loading are revealed with XPCI to depend on competing nucleation of initial flaws across scales, which give rise to a scattered fracture strength distribution. The fracture strengths increase with increasing strain rates due to accelerated crack propagation and damage growth. Quantitative gray-scale statistical analysis of XPCI and optical images yields spatial and temporal evolutions of damage. Unexpected plateaus essentially without damage growth are observed on the damage curves of glass, deviating from conventional theoretical predictions. The damage plateaus are attributed to growth, closure and re-expansion of inclined main cracks, due to interactions of stress waves with crack tips. The current results also demonstrate a reliable experimental technique for dynamic damage characterization of brittle materials.

The microwave absorption performances of the heterostructure are investigated in 2-18 GHz. Due to the complementary phenomenon between the dielectric loss and magnetic loss, the sum values of dielectric loss factor and magnetic loss factor almost keep a constant, indicating no change of loss ability on microwave. The heterostructure exhibits the broad effective bandwidth of 5.2 GHz at 2.3 mm, covering 12.4-17.4 and 17.8-18.0 GHz. The theoretical simulations reveal the interfacial polarization leads to the outstanding microwave absorbing performances. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Novel CaFe2O4/Bi2O3 composite photocatalysts were prepared via a facile grinding and calcination method and characterized by XRD, TEM, UV-vis and PL analysis, respectively. The photocatalytic activities of the samples were evaluated through photodegradation of malachite green (MG) under visible light. The as-prepared CaFe2O4/Bi2O3 composites showed higher photodegradation activity than that of pure Bi2O3 or CaFe2O4 sample. The enhanced photocatalytic activity could be due to improvement of the separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, which was beneficial for efficient charge carrier transport. The photocatalytic mechanism of the CaFe2O4/Bi2O3 composite was also proposed. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A novel shape-memory polymer having microspherical structure was prepared with Styrene (St), butyl acrylate (BA) and divinylbenzene (DVB) as the crosslinkers. The results clearly show the formation of crosslinked poly(St-DVB-BA) polymeric microspheres with high content of DVB. Through the variation of DVB content, different microspheres are formed, each having two-phase separation structure consisting of BA soft phase and St hard phase respectively. Both the St hard phase and chemical-crosslinker provided stable netpoints for thermally induced shape-memory effects. Thus, the Poly(St-DVB-BA) microspheres show the capability of shape deformation, shape fixation and shape recovery. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Vanadium oxide is a type of material with high temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) for bolometric infrared detection. In this letter, the effects of growth conditions of B-phase crystalline VO2, including reaction temperature, reaction time and quantities of precursors, were systematically investigated. Free-standing VO2(B) thin film composed of nano-sheets stacking on the (0 0 1) plane was prepared. The in-plane and out-of-plane TCRs were measured. A superior in-plane TCR of -3.0%/K was observed at room temperature, while the out-of-plane TCR only was -1.7%/K. We further showed that the I-V behavior of VO2(B) was voltage-dependent, and its possible origin was discussed. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB A novel high efficient p-n heterostructure photocatalyst is well designed and firstly realized on coupling electrospun TiO2 anatase/rutile mixed-crystal nanorods (T-A/R-NRs) and p-type ternary Cu3SnS4 (CTS), which is a hot photosensitive material in photovoltaics but rarely attracted in photocatalysis. Such configured CTS@T-A/R-NRs shows 2.02 eV band-gap and are demonstrated to be more efficient in photocatalytic degradation. The optimized CTS@T-A/R-NRs with 24 h hydrothermal reaction possesses a superior degradation rate of 1.3980 h(-1), which is 2.5 and 4.3 times than T-A/R-NRs (0.5490 h(-1)) and CTS (0.3240 h(-1)). It is mainly attributed to the better morphology for high light-harvesting, the established built-in electric field at p-n interfaces and special anatase/rutile mixed-crystal structure of TiO2 for efficient separation of photogenerated charges. The study indicates a promising strategy in designing potential nanostructures to simultaneously achieve high efficient photocatalytic degradation and photovoltaic conversion. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Submicron crystallites of CuS and Co doped CuS have been prepared by hydrothermal route. The structure of prepared crystallites were found to be hexagonal shape with space group P6(3)/mmc and the size of the crystallites is in the range 89-127 nm. The morphology of the prepared CuS is nanoflower and there is no change in the morphology with cobalt doping. The d spacing and the cell parameters of the crystallites is found to be decreasing with doping of cobalt. The samples are pressed into pellets and their thermoelectric properties were investigated. CuS has an exothermic peak at 390 K as obtained in Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) analysis so the electrical and thermal properties of all bulk samples were measured from 310 K to 370 K to avoid the phase change. The pure CuS samples prepared via hydrothermal synthesis reached the highest thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) of 5.45 x 10(-3) at 362 K and for the Cu1.6Co0.4S the ZT value is increased to 8.3 x 10(-3) at 362 K.

AB H4FePO4 center dot H2O is synthesized by both co-precipitation and rheological phase methods. The as-synthesized compounds have been characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. The electrochemical properties of NH4FePO4 center dot H2O as anode were initially investigated with a comprehensive battery testing system. The results showed that NH4FePO4 center dot H2O featured different electrochemical performances as synthesized by the two different methods. The NFP-1 sample synthesized by co-precipitation method had higher initial capacity (1406.8 mAh.g(-1)) than that of the NFP-2 (1247.9 mAh.g(-1)) sample synthesized by rheological method. After 100 cycles, NFP-1 showed higher reversible capacity (523.4 mAh.g(-1)) than that of NFP-2 (210.3 mAh.g(-1)) within the voltage range of 0.01 to 3.00 V (vs. Li+/Li) at current density of 100 mA.g(-1). The results suggested that NH4FePO4 center dot H2O prepared by co-precipitation is a novel and promising anode material for lithium-ion battery application. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Actinomorphic flower-like ZnO/ZnFe2O4 composite has been successfully synthesized by a facile two-step synthesis method. The as-prepared samples have been characterized by XRD, SEM and TEM. Compared with pure-ZnO sensor, the ZnO/ZnFe2O4-based sensor exhibited remarkably higher response, shorter response-recovery time and more superior selective to low-concentration NO2 at low operating temperature of 200 degrees C. The mechanism of enhanced gas-sensing performance of the ZnO/ZnFe2O4 composite with p-n heterostructure has been investigated. It indicates that the as-prepared ZnO/ZnFe2O4 composite is promising for NO2 gas sensor. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In the present study, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were synthesized using market vegetable waste extract. The formation of AgNPs was observed by a change in the reaction mixture colour from colourless to brown, after the addition of vegetable waste extract. The bioreduced AgNPs were characterized using transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive spectroscopy and other standard techniques. The antibacterial activity of the bioreduced AgNPs was analyzed for both Gram-negative (Klebsiella sp.,) and Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus sp.,). The results showed that the bioreduced AgNPs effectively inhibited the growth of the tested bacterial strains. The study revealed the effective method of utilizing market green vegetable waste for the synthesis of AgNPs with high antibacterial efficiency. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Development of localised shear bands (SB) in bulk metallic glassy (BMG) alloys was investigated by a high-speed microscopic imaging technique. The velocities of SBs propagating by a progressive mechanism were found to be in the m/s range. It has been shown that after rapid initiation, the mean SB velocity decays as a function of time t, exhibiting a scaling-like t (n) behaviour with n close to 2 over several orders of magnitude.

AB Rare earth modified bismuth ferrites are of interest as lead-free multiferroics, however reliable methods for reducing the electrical conductivity are needed. In this study ceramics with composition (Bi0.91Dy0.09) FeO3 were doped with 0.2 mol% cobalt (Co) and the impedance spectra, high electric field hysteresis and leakage current were compared to undoped ceramics. In pristine ceramics Co addition increased the bulk conductivity of the material but removed a relaxation from the dielectric loss and modulus in the frequency range 100 Hz-1 MHz. The remanent polarization and peak-to-peak strain of both ceramics were 38 mu C/cm(2) and 0.15% respectively, but surprisingly Co doped ceramics exhibited lower electrical leakage at above-coercive fields. Significant changes in the loss, modulus and leakage current of undoped ceramics after poling suggested that de-trapped charge carriers play a dominant role in the conductivity of undoped ceramics after poling. This effect was reduced by Co doping. (C) 2018 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB A thiolated magnetic double- layered core- shell particles Fe3O4@SiO2@C-SH is synthesized and characterized. The application in Hg2+ removal is discussed. The removal can finished in 10 min with high efficiency, and the maximum adsorption capacity is 184.00 mg/ g. The adsorption fits the Freundlich adsorption isotherm and the adsorption kinetic is the second-order kinetic. Through DubininRadushkevich (D-R) isothermal adsorption analysis, it is found the adsorption for Hg2+ is mainly physical adsorption, accompanied by chemical one.

AB Currently, potentiometric sensors based on various molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) receptors have been successfully fabricated for detection of organic species. However, almost all of the previously developed potentiometric sensors based on MIPs are in traditional liquid-contact mode in which lower detection limits have been restricted by zero-current transmembrane ion fluxes. Herein, a screen-printed potentiometric sensor for determination of 2-naphthoic acid has been developed. It is based on the MIP nanobeads as the selective receptor and the electrochemically reduced graphene oxide film as the solid contact. Compared with the classical potentiometric sensor, the proposed sensor based on nonequilibrium sensing mechanism exhibits remarkably improved detection sensitivity for 2-naphthoic acid with a low detection limit of 6.9 x 10 (11) M.

AB Chemical solution deposition is used to prepare Co5.47N thin films on LaAlO3 single crystal substrates. The derived thin films are phase-pure and polycrystalline. Annealing temperature effects on microstructures, magnetic and transport properties are investigated. The thin films annealed under 800 and 900 degrees C shows dense surface morphologies, whereas the 1000 degrees C annealing temperature will lead to dewetting. The derived Co5.47N thin films are ferromagnetic with Curie temperature higher than 632 K. The roomtemperature saturation magnetization is enhanced and the coercivity is decreased with increasing the annealing temperature from 800 to 1000 degrees C. The temperature dependent resistivity shows metallic behaviors, and it is decreased with increasing the annealing temperature. The results will provide a facile route to prepare Co5.47N thin films using chemical solution deposition. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Uniform Cu2O nanocubes were large-scale synthesized through a liquid-phase reduction method. TiO2 was further coated onto Cu2O nanocubes to form Cu2O@TiO2 core-shell composite based on hydrolysis reaction of titanium isopropoxide. As-synthesized Cu2O@ TiO2 were characterized by XRD, SEM and TEM. As anode materials for lithium ion batteries, Cu2O@ TiO2 core-shell composite showed higher discharge capacity and more stable cycling performance than the uncoated Cu2O nanocubes, exhibiting the strong composition effect.

AB BiOX (X = Cl, Br and I) hierarchical microspheres were prepared using a solvothermal method. As a popular group of photocatalysts, adsorption capacity of BiOX with the special morphology was rarely reported. Its adsorption capacity was greatly improved with a specific surface area of as high as similar to 23 mg/g. Also, from the crystal structure analysis, the exposed [1 0 2] facets are primary for BiOX microspheres ([ 0 0 1] facets for BiOX nanosheets), which is in favor of enhancing photocatalytic activity. In this work, we have also addressed the importance to consider the color change of BiOX when applied in photocatalysis, as oxygen/ halogen vacancies may be generated. This work sheds a light on reconsidering the role of adsorption as well as the stability (reusability) of BiOX in photocatalysis is significant. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Geopolymers are a new class of non-Portland cements produced using an alumino-silicate material (natural minerals, waste and/or industrial by-products) and an alkaline activator to be subsequently cured at relatively low temperatures. The aim of this work is to produce a new type of geopolymer using metakaolin (MK), rice husk ash (RHA) and red mud (RM) by alkaline activation containing sodium silicate and sodium hydroxide (NaOH). Four different geopolymer compositions were prepared at various Si/Al molar ratios (3.85, 4.30, 4.45 and 5.30). A metakaolin based geopolymers were synthesized as a reference. Specimens were characterized by XRD, ATR-FTIR and SEM/EDS. The study revealed that geopolymerization products exhibit an amorphous homogeneous structure with acceptable mechanical properties. RMRHA1 geopolymers shows the best mechanical characteristics (30 MPa) after 60 curing days. MKRHA-RM based geopolymers obtained seem to offer a feasible alternative to conventional Portland cement contributing to the valorization of the wastes. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Both Fasciola hepatica and Clonorchis sinensis are endemic in China, South Korea, Japan and other Southeast Asian countries. Reliable and sensitive diagnostic methods are needed for detecting their infections in humans and animals. Differential simplex and duplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods were developed. The PCRs targeted the second internal transcribed spacer (its2) (408 bp) of F. hepatica, and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 gene (nad2) (527 bp) of C. sinensis. Both simplex PCRs detected as little as 2 pg genomic DNA in one microliter in a 25 mu L PCR reaction system. The duplex PCR had similar detection limit as well, and detected as low as one egg in 200 mg feces. These methods were analytical specific with no amplification being observed from the gemonic DNA of Fasciolopsis buski, Haemonchus contorts, Ascaris ovis or Eimeri ahsata. Of 158 sheep fecal samples collected from various farms, four and one samples were PCR-positive for F. hepatica and C. sinensis, respectively. The duplex PCR method described here is time-saving and convenient, and may prove to be an invaluable tool for molecular detection and epidemiological investigation of F. hepatica and C. sinensis in endemic area.

AB Leishmania infantum infection was investigated in 202 wild carnivores, rodents and lagomorphs in Southeast Spain using a real-time PCR (rtPCR) in skin and organ samples, mostly spleen. Lesions compatible with leishmaniosis were not observed in any of the animals. Prevalence defined as the percentage of rtPCR-positive animals was 32% overall, and 45% in foxes (n = 69), 30% in rabbits (n = 80) and stone martens (n = 10), 19% in wood mice (n = 16), 0% in black rats (n = 10) and ranged between 0% and 100% in other minoritarian species including badgers, wild cats, wolves, raccoons, genets and hares. Most infected rabbits were rtPCR-positive in skin and not in spleen samples and the opposite was the case for foxes (p < 0.05). L. infantum prevalence was lowest in spring following months of non-exposure to phlebotomine sand fly vectors, and spatially matched recently estimated Phlebotomus perniciosus vector abundance and the prevalence of subclinical infection in dogs and humans. Prevalence increased with altitude and was greater in drier and less windy South and West compared to the coastal Southeast of the study area (p < 0.05). Genetic diversity of L. infantum from foxes, investigated by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphisms of kinetoplast DNA, revealed B genotype in all animals, which is frequent in people and dogs in the Iberian Peninsula and Morocco. The study provides further evidence that subclinical L. infantum infection is widespread in wildlife with prevalence depending on environmental factors and that parasite tissue tropism may vary according to host species. Moreover, it suggests that sylvatic and domestic transmission cycles are closely interconnected.

AB Experts recommend a change in the control of equine parasites across the world in order to adopt a surveillance-based approach utilizing parasite faecal egg counts (FEC). Several European countries have implemented prescription-only restrictions of anthelmintic usage by law, which is in stark contrast to US, where all anthelmintic products continue to be available over the counter. This study aimed to describe and compare equine parasite control strategies employed in Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, US, and Denmark. An invitation to participate in an online questionnaire survey was published on a large equine news website in each of the participating countries. The main focus of the study was on usage of FEC and anthelmintic treatment intensity in three different equine age groups; foals, 1-3 year-olds and > 3 years old. A total of 3092 respondents participated in the study. Danish respondents used significantly more faecal analyses in their parasite control strategies than participants from the other four countries (p < 0.0001). Similarly, Danish participants administered significantly fewer anthelmintic treatments per horse per year (p < 0.0001) independent of the age of the horse, and had been using a selective treatment strategy for a significantly longer time period than their counterparts in other countries (p < 0.0001). Only minor differences were found between respondents from the other four countries. This is remarkable as both Austria and Germany have had prescription-only restrictions for 3-4 decades. Yet, their parasite control strategies were more similar to those employed by American respondents. The Netherlands had only recently introduced prescription-only restrictions by the time this survey was conducted which can explain why Dutch respondents were also similar to their American counterparts. Taken together, this study illustrates substantially different worm control strategies practiced in Denmark, and this difference cannot be explained by legislation alone.

AB We examined 151 European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax L.) samples from farms and fish markets of Sicily (Southern Italy) for Anisakidae larvae detection. All the samples were examined by visual inspection and modified chloro-peptic digestion. Two nematode larvae were found in the viscera of only one European sea bass sample from a farm located in Greece (FAO 37.3), giving a total prevalence of infestation of 0.7%. No other parasites were found after chloro-peptic digestion of the samples. The larvae were morphologically ascribed, at genus level, to morphotypes I and molecularly identified as Anisakis pegreffii. To the best if our knowledge, this is the first report on the presence of anisakid parasites in farmed European sea bass of Mediterranean Sea. Our findings suggest that the risk of exposure to Anisakidae nematodes in farmed European sea bass remains very low. However, further data on Mediterranean farms are needed to have a detailed risk analysis.

AB Liver fluke (Fasciola hepatica) infection is an increasing threat to livestock production resulting in serious economic losses to the beef, dairy and sheep industries in Australia and globally. Triclabendazole (TCBZ) is the main drug used to control liver fluke infections in Australia and the widespread emergence of TCBZ resistance in cattle and sheep threatens liver fluke control. Alternative control measures to lower exposure of livestock to fluke infection would be useful to help preserve the usefulness of current chemical flukicides. Environmental DNA (eDNA) sampling methodology and associated molecular techniques are suited to rapidly assess the presence of pathogens on farms. In the present study, we developed a water sampling method in combination with a multiplex quantitative PCR assay to detect and quantify DNA of F. hepatica and Austropeplea tomentosa (A. tomentosa), a crucial intermediate snail host for liver fluke transmission in South-east Australia. The multiplex qPCR assay allows for the independent detection of F. hepatica and A. tomentosa DNA using specific primers and a probe targeting the ITS-2 region of the liver fluke or snail. The method allows the highly specific and sensitive (minimal DNA detection levels to 14-50 fg) detection of F. hepatica or A. tomentosa. The method allows the detection of both liver fluke and snail eDNA in water samples. The effective quantification of liver fluke and snail eDNA in water samples using this assay could potentially allow researchers to both identify and monitor F. hepatica transmission zones on farming properties in South-east Australia which will better inform control strategies, with potential application of the assay worldwide.

AB Toxocariasis is a widespread helminth infection of dogs and cats, caused by Toxocara canis and Toxocara cad larvae, respectively. Toxocara spp. can cause zoonotic infections in humans by invading tissues and organs causing pathology. Toxocara spp. larvae release excretory-secretory molecules (TES) into the body of their host that are fundamental to the host-parasite interaction and could be used as targets for novel diagnostics and vaccines. In the present study, we identified 646 T. canis proteins from TES and larval extract using 1D-SDS PAGE followed by mass spectrometry. A wide range of proteins was identified that may play a role both in the induction of the host immune response and host pathology, and in parasite metabolism and survival. Among these proteins there are potential candidates for novel diagnostics and vaccines for dogs and cats toxocariases.

AB Horse flies (Diptera: Tabanidae) are of medical and veterinary importance because they are known to transmit pathogens. Approximately 80 species of horse flies have been reported in Thailand. Monitoring the distribution of horse fly species is important to control the spread of diseases transmitted by them. Currently, the species identification of horse flies is based on their morphology; this requires considerable skills and taxonomic expertise, and it may be difficult to identify morphologically similar species. DNA-based identification methods are increasingly being developed for rapid and accurate identification of various insect species. In this study, we used mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) for species identification of horse flies in Thailand. A 658 bp fragment of COI was amplified from 145 adult horse flies belonging to 48 morphologically distinct species and sequenced. Sequence analysis revealed an intraspecific divergence of 0.0%-4.4% and an interspecific divergence of 0.0%-16.2%. Our results showed that COI barcodes were effective in discriminating a majority of horse flies in Thailand on the basis of the barcoding gap and phylogenetic analyses. However, COI barcodes were unable to distinguish among members of the Tabanus striatus complex and some species within the T. ceylonicus group.

AB Giardia duodenalis is a pathogenic protozoan that causes diarrhea in mammalian hosts including humans and companion animals, and the host specificity differs depending on the genetic assemblages. The purpose of the present study is to perform multilocus genotyping at four loci of G. duodenalis isolates from household cats and pet shop kittens in Japan and evaluate the zoonotic potential. Fifty-seven fecal samples from cats (household cats: 13, pet shop kittens: 44), which were positive for Giardia-specific antigen as determined by an ELISA kit, were the subjects of our analysis. Nested or semi-nested PCRs targeting 18S ribosomal RNA (18S rRNA), glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), beta-giardin (BG), and triosephosphate isomerase (TPI) were performed on all samples. All DNA amplicons were sequenced for genotyping. Forty-four isolates (household cats: 11, pet shop kittens: 33) were positive for at least one of the PCRs. Assemblage F was the most frequently detected (75%; 33/ 44), followed by assemblage A (13.6%; 6/44) and assemblage B (2.3%; 1/44). Four isolates (9.1%) showed the results as mixed assemblages F and A. Sub-genotyping of assemblage A isolates based on three loci (GDH, BG, and TPI) identified all of them as assemblage AI. DNA sequences of zoonotic G. duodenalis assemblages were detected from 25% of the genotyped specimens, and these were found at several shops and hospitals in Japan, which suggests that zoonotic G. duodenalis is prevalent among domestic cats in Japan, and that the considerable risk of zoonotic transmission of G. duodenalis from household cats or pet shop kittens to humans exists.

ID INFECTION
AB The brown rat, Rattus norvegicus, with a worldwide distribution, is the most commensal species among synanthropic rodents, since its main habitat, in urban as well as in rural areas, is always linked to humans. Therefore, people living in close proximity to rodent populations can be exposed to infection. Whereas bacteria and viruses are the best known rat-associated zoonoses in urban environments, the role of brown rats as reservoirs for helminth parasites and the associated risk for humans are less well known. Specifically, this role has not been analyzed in Spain to date. A total of 100 R. norvegicus trapped in the sewage system (n = 85), and parks (n = 15) of Barcelona was examined. The overall prevalence of helminth infection was 85%. The helminths found were Hymenolepis nana (17%), H. diminuta (33%) (Cestoda), Calodium hepaticum (17%), Eucoleus gastricus (28%), Aonchotheca annulosa (12%), Trichosomoides crassicauda (7%), Nippostrongylus brasiliensis (46%), Heterakis spumosa (62%), Gongylonema neoplasticum (20%) (Nematoda) and Moniliformis moniliformis (6%) (Acanthocephala). Five of the ten helminth species are considered zoonotic parasites, with rats acting as reservoirs for human infection, i.e. H. nana, H. diminuta, C. hepaticum, G. neoplasticum and M. moniliformis. G. neoplasticum and M. moniliformis are reported for the first time in urban rats in Europe. H. nana, H. diminuta and C. hepaticum are the most widespread species in European cities. For H. nana and C. hepaticum, rats act as effective spreaders of the human infective stage (eggs). For H. diminuta, G. neoplasticum and M. moniliformis, rats act as indirect reservoirs of the zoonoses since the eggs shed by the rats are infective for their insect intermediate hosts only. Medical practitioners need to be made aware of the range of parasites carried by rats, as there is a realistic likelihood that ill health currently caused by rat infestations may be misdiagnosed.

AB Equine strongyle parasites are ubiquitous in grazing equids across the world. Anthelmintic resistance is widely developed in cyathostomin populations, but very few surveys have evaluated anthelmintic efficacy in equine populations in the United States, and most of these are over 15 years old. The present study was carried out as part of the National Animal Health Monitoring Systems (NAHMS) Equine 2015-2016 study. The aims were to investigate anthelmintic treatment efficacy by means of the fecal egg count reduction test (FECRT) and identify parameters associated with decreased efficacy. Data were collected from equine operations in 28 states via questionnaires and fecal samples submitted for fecal egg count analysis. Participants were instructed to collect samples from six equids at the day of anthelmintic treatments and 14 days later, and they were asked to include an empty syringe with a legible label of the anthelmintic product used in the shipment. Overall, dewormer treatment was effective for 76.3% of operations (84.6% of animals). Macrocyclic lactone use was effective for 88.7% of operations (95.0% of animals) while pyrimidine/benzimidazole use was effective for 21.4% of operations (43.5% of animals). Univariate analysis revealed that overall, macrocyclic lactones exhibited significantly higher efficacy than the pyrimidine and benzimidazole drug classes (p < 0.0001). There were no statistically significant differences observed between geographic regions (West, South Central, North East, and Southeast). Body weight (p = 0.0355), amount of anthelmintic administered (p = 0.0119), and operation size (p = 0.0162) were statistically associated with anthelmintic efficacy, while anthelmintic treatment frequency in the previous 12 months was not (p = 0.7081). Multiple, mixed-effect logistic regression revealed that anthelmintic drug class (p < 0.0001) was the most impactful factor in predicting anthelmintic efficacy, after accounting for operation size, region and clustering of equids at the operation level. Pasture rotation (p = 0.0129) also demonstrated a significant effect using this model. These data document widespread occurrence of reduced anthelmintic efficacy of benzimidazole and pyrimidine products against strongyle infections in equids in the United States. Anthelmintic efficacy patterns were relatively uniform between the four studied regions, and some epidemiological factors were identified to be associated with anthelmintic efficacy against strongyle infections. This information can be useful in devising sustainable parasite control strategies in the future.

AB Understanding diagnosis of heartworm disease in the context of animal shelters' needs and expectations is crucial for developing guidelines that specifically address the unique shelter population. Accurate and economical heartworm testing strategies are essential. However, current comprehensive guidelines for the management of heartworm disease in dogs are directed toward client-owned animals and do not address needs of animal shelters and other resource-scarce facilities. Additionally, testing recommendations do not take into account regional and local differences in heartworm prevalence across the United States that occur due to abiotic and biotic factors. The objective of this study was to determine the apparent prevalence of Dirofilaria immitis microfilaremia and antigenemia in dogs from Mississippi animal shelters. Further, we compare agreement between microfilaria and antigen testing in this population. We performed a cross-sectional study using canine serum and blood bank samples representative of the Mississippi shelter population. Microfilaria testing of whole blood included a blood smear and modified Knott test. Antigen testing of serum was performed using the DiroCHEK (R) antigen ELISA test. Analyses included descriptive and analytic statistics as well as Cohen's kappa for test agreement. A total of 283 whole blood samples and 363 serum samples, representing 363 dogs from 18 shelters in 17 Mississippi counties, were utilized in this study. Sixty-four (22.6%) whole blood samples demonstrated D. immitis microfilariae on the modified Knott test and 125 (34.4%) serum samples had detectable D. immitis antigen. Increasing age and low body condition were associated with antigen-positive test results. Only age was associated with microfilaria-positive test results. There was moderate agreement between the antigen ELISA test and the modified Knott microfilaria test and poor agreement between the antigen ELISA and the blood smear. This study provides the first known report of the prevalence of D. immitis microfilaremia and antigenemia in Mississippi shelter dogs. We observed that prevalence of both microfilaremia and antigenemia was significantly higher in these sampled dogs compared to previous reports for the owned canine population in Mississippi. Heartworm infection presents unique management challenges for animal shelters. Knowledge of the expected prevalence in the area can be utilized for management decisions related to prevention, testing, and treatment of dogs in shelter populations.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of an insecticidal product in rabbits that combines the neonicotinoid dinotefuran with the pyrethroid permethrin plus the insect growth regulator pyriproxyfen. Adult New Zealand rabbits (n = 12) were infested with Ctenocephalides felis felis (50 males and 50 females per rabbit) at days -7, -2, +5, +12 and +19. The control group (n = 6) received no treatment and the treated group (n = 6) received the commercial formulation, indicated for use in dogs, which was applied topically on day 0. The animals were mechanically evaluated with combs (comb test), to assess pulicidal efficacy, on days -5, +2, +7, +14 and +21. All flea removals and counts were performed by region, following the order: head, ears, neck, forelegs, dorsum, abdomen, hind limbs and tail, in order to determine the preferred sites of parasitism by the C. felis felis flea in rabbits. The distribution of fleas prevailed in the head region (about 62%), followed by the neck and back (14 and 11%, respectively). The insecticidal efficacy was calculated using arithmetic means, showing effectiveness of 100% on days +2 and +7 and 82.2% and 81.6%, on days +14 and +21, respectively. Thus the present study has shown the combination to be a viable option in the treatment and control of rabbits infested by C. felis felis.

AB Leishmaniases are endemic in Brazil, where Leishmania infantum has been detected in humans, dogs, cats, and phlebotomine vectors. Monitoring synanthropic vector populations is critical for leishmaniasis control-surveillance in such transmission-prone areas. Here, a suite of molecular approaches were used to assess Leishmania infection prevalence and to identify blood-meal sources in a large sample of sand flies collected in anthropic environments of a Leishmania-transmission area in Mato Grosso do Sul State (Rio Verde de Mato Grosso municipality), Central-West Brazil. We sampled sand flies monthly (January-June 2014 and 2016) in one peridomestic site within each of six neighborhoods with recent records of human visceral and/or tegumentary leishmaniasis. kDNA-qPCR plus rDNA ITS-sequencing were used to detect and identify Leishmania in pooled female sand flies. Individual engorged females (n = 58) were used for blood-meal analyses through High-Resolution Melting (HRM) targeting the mtDNA cytb gene. Overall, 90.5% of 420 CDC trap-nights yielded vectors, for a total catch of 24,989 sand flies. We sub-sampled and identified 3088 sand flies of 12 species, including 2775 Lutzomyia longipalpis (the most abundant species at all sampling sites) and 297 Nyssomyia whitmani. Female sand flies (n = 1261) were grouped in 159 pools, of which 92 Lu. longipalpis (minimum infection rate [MIR] 8%) and 7 Ny. whitmani pools (MIR 7%) were Leishmania kDNA-positive. Most positive Lu. longipalpis were collected in the 2016 rainy season. Sequencing confirmed L. infantum in Lu. longipalpis samples. HRM analyses identified chicken DNA in 57 sand flies (98.3%), 37 of which were Leishmania DNA-positive (64.9%); human blood was found in just one (Leishmania-negative) female. Our data show ongoing risk of L. infant= transmission to humans in the study area, where Leishmania-infected sandfly vectors are common and heavily rely on chicken blood in the ped-domestic environment.

AB The performance of a new cooling technique composed of a heat spreader (HS) and microchannels for cooling the solar cells (photovoltaic panels) is carried out. 3D steady state physical model for the solar cell coupled with the heat spreader and the microchannels is developed and solved numerically. The model is used to investigate the effect of using the microchannels with the HS on the performance of the solar cell. Also, the effect of different configurations of the microchannels-HS cooling system on the solar cell performance is studied. These configurations are tested at different concentration ratios (CRs) of the incident solar radiation and different Reynolds number (Re) of the coolant water inside the microchannels. The results indicate that the cooling system with HS has the smallest value of the solar cell temperature and the maximum temperature difference of the cell. It also has the greatest cell efficiency and output electrical and net power of the cell compared to the cooling system without HS. When the microchannels and the solar cell have equal surface area and their area is smaller than HS area, the solar cell has the maximum net power output at high Reynolds number. At low CR (CR = 5), the cooling system with HS increases the cell efficiency and the net power compared to the system without HS by about 8%, and 13% respectively at Re equal 5 and 13% and 2% respectively at Re equal 65. Also, at high CR (CR = 20), using HS increases the cell efficiency and the net power by about 50% and 3.7% respectively at Re equal 5, and 53% and 2.8% respectively at Re equal 65. At high Re number, the most efficient cooling system configuration occurs when the microchannels and the solar cell have the same area and the HS area is greater than their surface area.

AB In this study, a theoretical model of a concentrated photovoltaic-thermoelectric hybrid system has been developed based on first and second laws of thermodynamics and analysed in MATALB. A numerical method has been exploited to determine the temperatures of photovoltaic module (PV) and hot and cold side of thermoelectric generator (TEG) by iteratively solving the energy balance equations. The proposed study takes into account the effects of hot and cold side thermal resistances, thermoelectric properties, fill factor, geometry of thermoelectric module, load resistance and electrical current on the performance of the hybrid system. The results show that the optimum value of ratio of TEG load resistance to TEG internal resistance, m for maximum power output and efficiency of thermoelectric module is higher than unity. The concentration ratio should also be optimized to achieve maximum PV power output. For the fixed leg length of 5 mm and CG value of 1 kW/m(2), the optimum m corresponding to maximum power output and maximum efficiency of the hybrid system is 0.5. The maximum power output and efficiency of the hybrid system increase by 5% as compared to the corresponding values of concentrated PV system. Moreover, at higher concentration ratios, the contribution of thermoelectric power to the power output of hybrid system is higher. Further, for other parameters fixed, the optimum value of CG for maximum power output of the hybrid system is 5.5 kW/m(2) and it is 14% higher than the corresponding power output of CPV system alone. This improvement in the performance of hybrid system is added by the thermoelectric generator module. The results of this analysis incorporating the electrical and thermal contact resistances of thermoelectric device, may be helpful to envisage the design of a real photovoltaic-thermoelectric hybrid system.

AB The combined production of electricity, heat and cold by a polygeneration system connected to a district heating and cooling network can provide high energy utilization efficiency. The inherent complexity of simultaneous production of different services and the high variability in the energy demand make combined cooling and heating systems performance highly dependent on the operational strategy. In this paper, ari operational optimization method based on the moving average of real-time measurements of energy demands and ambient conditions is proposed. Real energy demand data from a district heating and cooling network close to Barcelona, Spain, are used to test the method. A complex polygeneration system is considered, consisting of an internal combustion engine, a double-effect absorption chiller, an electric chiller, a boiler and a cooling tower. A detailed modelling of the system is provided, considering partial load behavior of the components and ambient conditions effects. Results of the real-time optimal management are discussed and compared to traditional operational strategies and to the ideal optimal management achievable with perfectly accurate forecast of energy demands. Moreover, the optimal width of the window adopted for the moving average of real-time data is identified.

AB In this paper, we apply a life cycle thermoecological cost (LC-TEC) approach to evaluate the environmental performance of wind turbines with different capacities and performance characteristics. LC-TEC expresses the cumulative consumption of non-renewable exergy burdening the fabrication of the considered consumption of the product with the additional inclusion of necessity of compensating adverse environmental effects due to harmful waste products rejection. Differently, from what has been recently done in the literature on the environmental performance of wind turbines, where the attention has been mainly drawn by analysis of single turbine, we focus on the synthesis of the results for wind turbines with different capacities and the generalisation of the results under different environmental conditions.
   The selected functional unit for the comparison was 1 MJ of produced electricity, assuming a service lifetime equal to 20 years. Concerning the contribution analysis, the construction phase is the most intensive one for wind energy technologies with a share varying from 64 to 77% in the overall effect. Substantial differences in LC-TEC are observed for wind turbines of different capacity and different locations of the power plant. Results show that the LC-TEC of electricity significantly decrease while the turbine nominal power increases. For instance, for the average site, described by Weibull distribution parameters of mean wind speed of 5 m/s and shape coefficient 2, the TEC-LC for 1 kW micro wind turbine is estimated to be equal to 0.436 MJ(ex) /MJ, while for a larger, 2 MW one, fall in the range of 0.053-0.063 MJ(ex)/MJ. We found that a power function can successfully describe such a trend. Moreover, we observed considerable changes in the final results for different Weibull distribution parameters. Specifically, the LC-TEC differs significantly for the sites with lower mean wind speed and different shape factors.
   Finally, we propose the supporting system for wind energy basing on the LC-TEC and pro-ecological taxing. According to this concept, the power units with LC-TEC below unity are to be supported, and the proposed level of pro-ecological support (ExTAX - Exergy TAX) is proportional to the thermo-ecological cost.
   The obtained results of exergy supporting for wind energy technologies are applied in the Italian electricity market and compared with the existing financing system for wind energy based on green certificates and feed-in tariff system.

AB This paper presents the design of a novel high-temperature solar assisted triple-pressure level combined cycle power plant. The system includes innovative high-temperature flat plate evacuated solar thermal collectors, a double stage lithium bromide/water absorption chiller, pumps, heat exchangers, storage tanks, mixers, diverters, controllers and a triple-pressure combined cycle power plant. This novel layout uses high-vacuum non-concentrating flat plate solar thermal collectors driving a double effect absorption chiller, leading to an overall high coefficient of performance for the solar cooling section. The provided cooling energy is used to cool gas turbine inlet air to enhance system efficiency and electrical capacity. This effect is mainly performed during central hours of the day when the conventional gas-fired combined cycles dramatically suffer for efficiency and capacity reduction, as a consequence of the corresponding increase of external air temperature. Such increase is related to the higher availability of solar radiation. This technology may be a viable solution, especially for hot and dry areas, in terms of primary energy savings and increased revenues. This prototypal system was numerically analysed for a combined cycle with a rated electrical power of 99 MWe and an electrical efficiency of 56%, developing a dynamic simulation model and detailed thermo-economic optimizations. Special attention is also paid to the design of novel control strategies aiming at maximizing the solar cooling effect. The results of the dynamic simulations show a very high average thermal efficiency of the solar collectors, equal to 34%. Implications of the performed work allowed an increase of the power output up to 5.5% and a satisfactory payback period equal to 10.7 years.

AB Studying the profile of micro RNAs (miRs) elucidated the highest expressed miRs in hepatic differentiation. In this study, we investigated to clarify the role of three embryonic overexpressed miRs (miR-106a, miR-574-3p and miR-451) during hepatic differentiation of human umbilical cord derived mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs). We furthermore, aimed to explore whether overexpression of any of these miRs alone is sufficient to induce the differentiation of the UC-MSCs into hepatocyte-like cells. UC-MSCs were transfected either alone or together with miR-106a, miR-574-3p and miR-451 and their potential hepatic differentiation and alteration in gene expression profile, morphological changes and albumin secretion ability were investigated. We found that up-regulation of any of these three miRs alone cannot induce expression of all hepatic specific genes. Transfection of each miR alone, led to Sox17, FoxA2 expression that are related to initiation step of hepatic differentiation. However, concurrent ectopic overexpression of three miRs together can induce UC-MSCs differentiation into functionally mature hepatocytes. These results show that miRs have the capability to directly convert UC-MSCs to a hepatocyte phenotype in vitro.

AB Long-non-coding RNA (LncRNA) is a kind of non-coding endogenous RNA that plays essential roles in diverse biological processes and various stress responses. To identify and elucidate the intricate regulatory roles of lncRNAs in chilling injury in tomato fruit, deep sequencing and bioinformatics methods were performed here. After strict screening, a total of 1411 lncRNAs were identified. Among these lncRNAs, 239 of them were significantly differentially expressed. A large amount of target genes were identified and many of them were found to code chilling stress related proteins, including redox reaction related enzyme, important enzymes about cell wall degradation, membrane lipid peroxidation related enzymes, heat and cold shock protein, energy metabolism related enzymes, salicylic acid and abscisic acid metabolism related genes. Interestingly, 41 lncRNAs were found to be the precursor of 33 miRNAs, and 186 lncRNAs were targets of 45 miRNAs. These lncRNAs targeted by miRNAs might be potential ceRNAs. Particularly, a sophisticated regulatory model including miRNAs, lncRNAs and their targets was set up. This model revealed that some miRNAs and lncRNAs may be involved in chilling injury, which provided a new perspective of lncRNAs role.

AB Horizontal gene transfer (HGT), a mechanism that shares genetic material between the host and donor from separated offspring branches, has been described as a means of producing novel and beneficial phenotypes for the host organisms. However, in molluscs, the second most diverse group, the existence of HGT is still controversial. In the present study, 12 HGT genes were identified from California two-spot octopus Octopus bimaculoides based on a similarity search, phylogenetic construction, gene composition analysis and PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) validation. Based on the phylogenetic topologies, ten HGT genes were identified to have been transferred into the possible molluscan ancestor, possibly before its radiation. Furthermore, most of the donor organisms were predicted to be familiar bacteria in marine environments. These horizontally transferred genes were under a strong negative selection and could be transcribed in octopus functionally. The predicted biochemical functions of these genes include metabolism, neurotransmission, immune defense and tissue integrity. Seven Zn-metalloproteinases were validated as the main type of HGT genes in octopus with divergent motif composition, intron presence and phylogenetic relationship to the endogenous ones. Furthermore, the functions of Zn-metalloproteinase were predicted to be responsible for immune defense and tissue remolding. Three HGT genes were distributed mainly in the nervous system and were predicted to regulate the neurotransmission through glia neuronal interactions. The results collectively indicated the existence of HGT in molluscs and its potential contribution to the evolution of octopus with regards to functional innovation and adaptability.

AB High resolution chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) has facilitated the identification of small chromosomal rearrangements throughout the genome, associated with various neurodevelopmental phenotypes, including ID/DD. Recently, it became evident that intellectual disability (ID)/developmental delay (DD) can occur with associated co-morbidities like epileptic seizures, autism and additional congenital anomalies. These observations require whole genome approach in order to detect the genetic causes of these complex disorders. In this study, we examined 92 patients of Bulgarian origin at age between 1 and 22 years with ID, generalized epilepsy, autistic signs and congenital anomalies. CMA was carried out using SurePrint G3 Human CGH Microarray Kit, 4 x 180 K and SurePrint G3 Unrestricted CGH ISCA v2, 4 x 180 K oligo platforms. Referral indications for selection of the patients were the presence of generalized refractory seizures disorders and co-morbid ID. Clearly pathogenic copy number variations (CNVs) were detected in eight patients (8.7%) from our cohort. Additionally, possibly pathogenic rearrangements of unclear clinical significance were detected in six individuals (6.5%), which make for an overall diagnostic yield of 15.2% among our cohort of patients.
   We report here the patients with clearly pathogenic CNVs, discuss the potential causality of the possibly pathogenic CNVs and make genotype - phenotype correlations. One novel possibly pathogenic heterozygous deletion in 15q22.31 region was detected in a case with ID/DD. Additionally, whole APBA2 gene duplication in 15q13.1 was found in three generations of a family with epilepsy, ID and psychiatric abnormalities. The results from this study allow us to define the genetic diagnosis in a subset of Bulgarian patients and improve the genetic counseling of the affected families. To our knowledge, this is the first aCGH evaluation of a Bulgarian cohort of children with epilepsy and ID so far.

AB Objectives: Human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that harbors activating mutations in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) initially responds to treatment with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as gefitinib and erlotinib but eventually tumor cells acquire resistance. To date, several gene expression profiles have been reported in TKIs-resistant EGFR-mutant NSCLC. The objective of this study is to identify robust gene expression signatures, biological processes, and promising overcoming targets for TKIs-resistant EGFR-mutant NSCLC.
   Materials and methods: Five publicly available microarray datasets were integrated by performing two network based meta-analyses following by protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and gene set enrichment analysis.
   Results and Conclusion: According to our meta-analyses, 830 and 1286 genes were differentially expressed in the TKIs-resistant EGFR-mutant NSCLC cell lines compared to TKIs-sensitive EGFR-mutant NSCLC cell lines in the absence and presence of TKIs treatment, respectively. PPI network analysis identified ESR1 and ELAVLI to be the most highly ranked hub genes involved in the NSCLC acquired TKI-resistance. Moreover, gene set enrichment analyses indicated that up-regulated genes are mainly distributed in hallmarks "Glycolysis", some "E2F targets". Down-regulated genes mainly contribute to hallmarks "interferon alpha response", "interferon gamma response", and also "E2F targets". For the first time, this study has demonstrated several robust candidate genes and pathways of the NSCLC acquired TKI-resistance. Further experimental verifications are highly recommended to examine our findings.

AB Objectives: Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an autosomal dominant disorder of cholesterol metabolism. Three recognized genes (LDLR, APOB and PCSK9) present in only 20-30% of patients with possible FH cases. Additional FH-causing genes need to be explored. The present study found an isolated gene change, sEH R287Q, in a core family of FH. In this study, we aimed to investigate the roles of R287Q on sEH expression and on LDLR expression, LDL binding to LDLR and LDL internalization.
   Materials and methods: 167 lipid-related genes of a core FH family were sequenced using a gene-capture chip. Through carrier dependent protein expression, the expression level (western blot), hydrolase activity (fluorescent chemistry) and intracellular localization (immunofluorescence and Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope) of recombinant sEH R287Q in cultured BEL-7402 cells were conducted. The effect of wild type and R287Q of sEH on LDLR expression, LDL binding to LDLR and LDL internalization were also conducted through Flow Cytometry.
   Results: sEH R287Q was the only gene changes among 167 lipid-related genes in the FH core family. Both expression level and hydrolase activity of recombinant sEH R287Q in cultured cells were significantly declined compared with that of the wild type sEH. sEH R287Q also decreased the binding of LDL to LDLR and LDL internalization and had no effect on cell-surface LDLR protein level.
   Conclusion: Our results suggest that sEH R287Q may have a role in the elevation of blood LDL in FH. The exactly role of sEH R287Q on FH deserves further study.

AB Two isoforms, Bmpop-a and Bmpop-b, were cloned and characterized, which were found to encode prolyl oligopeptidase (Pop) of the domestic silkworm Bombyx mori. The full lengths of Bmpop-a and Bmpop-b were 2497 and 2508 bp, deducing 707 and 740 amino acids, respectively. Both of them, possessing the typical characteristics of the Pop family of serine proteinase, were detected to be expressed among different tissues and development stages at the transcription and translation levels. Soluble recombinant BmPop-a (rBmPop-a) had oligopeptidase activity toward the substrates, Z-Gly-Pro-pNA, Z-Gly-Pro-AMC and angiotensin I. An inhibition assay showed that the activity of rBmPop-a was significantly inhibited by KYP-2047 and 517092 in vitro. BmPop-b was identified in the molting fluids at three different stages by Western blotting analysis, showing a predominant expression in the integument. Two isoforms of Bmpop gene and other three genes in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in the integument were down-regulated by starvation treatments but up-regulated by refeeding. These results suggested that BmPops may play an important role in balancing the molting fluid pressure to guarantee ecdysis normally. This study provides clues for further elucidating the function and regulation mechanisms of two isoforms of Bmpop gene.

AB Long non coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a class of non-protein coding RNAs that play a crucial role in most of the biological activities like nodule metabolism, flowering time and male sterility. Quite often, the function of lncRNAs is species-specific in nature. Thus an attempt has been made in cluster bean (Cyamopsis tetragonoloba) for the first time to computationally identify lncRNAs based on a proposed index and study their targeted genes. Further, these targeted genes of lncRNAs were identified and characterized for their role in various biological processes like stress mechanisms, DNA damage repair, cell wall synthesis. Besides, lncRNAs and miRNAs bearing Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs) were identified that contribute towards biogenesis of small non-coding RNAs. Moreover, five novel endogenous Target Mimic lncRNAs (eTMs) were identified that may disrupt the miRNA-mRNA regulations. For easy understanding and usability, a database CbLncRNAdb has been developed and made available at http://cabgrid.res.in/cblncrnadb.

AB The Himalayan Foreland Basin was formed over a failed rift zone that produced early Paleogene volcanism, which was synchronous to Indo-Asia collision. The rift zone was located over acutely flexed leading edge of the Indian continental crust. The volcanism preceded upliftment of the proto-Himalaya. The Jammu Himalaya is one of the few areas exposing the basal part of the foreland basin comprising a persistent horizon of volcani-sedimentary rhyolitic chert breccia at the base of the Subathu Formation, which unconformably overlies the Precambrian Jammu Limestone. Contemporaneous felsic ash beds occur in the Subathu-Kalka area in the Simla Hills at the base of the Subathu Formation unconformably overlying the Precambrian Simla Group. In Arunachal Pradesh, in the eastern-most Himalaya, early-mid Eocene foraminifera fauna bearing Yinkiong Formation overlies the Abor Volcanics. The age of the latter is disputed: whether it is early Permian or Eocene in age, or it exposes a mixture of both components. Recent U-Pb SHRIMP zircon geochronological study indicates Abor Volcanics being part of the Kerguelen mantle plume trail traversing Southern Tibet, Sylhet, Rajmahal, Bunbury and Kerguelen Plateau. Trace element geochemistry of the Abor Volcanics, the exposed volcanic rocks around Yinkiong and those exposed between Pangin and Rotung indicate rift signature. In the frontal belt, early Eocene shallow marine sediments locally associated with mafic volcanics occur tectonically at the base of the early Neogene foreland sequence. The latter is locally thrust at MBT by the early Permian meta-sediments tectonically intermixed with marine Eocene rocks. Early Eocene sediments and rift related mafic volcanics from Arunachal Pradesh possibly occur at the tectonic base of the Tertiary foreland basin sequence from northeastern Himalaya. The early Paleogene mafic volcanics from the Arunachal Pradesh and coeval acid volcanics occurring at the base of the Paleogene sequence in Jammu-Simla Himalaya might represent cogenetic bimodal volcanism.
   The Subathu Formation with its coal and carbonaceous sediments is lithologically similar to the coal and mud-rock bearing late Paleocene Patala Formation or the Hangu Formation and early Eocene Ghazij Formation from the adjacent Indus Foreland Basin, Pakistan, which overlie the Mesozoic-Paleocene carbonate flat. Although, the lithofacies and sedimentary tectonic setting of the Patala, Hangu and the Ghazij formations are similar to that of the Subathu Formation, the former units typically lack the presence of syn-sedimentary ash beds or any other volcanic rocks that are characteristically present at the base of the Subathu Formation. Mainly late Paleocene coal bearing Patala and the Hangu formations in Salt Range and North Potwar area, Pakistan, although located close to the Jammu sector of the Himalayan Foreland Basin is free of any volcanic activity. Salt Range and Potwar areas are possibly not parts of the foreland fold-and-thrust belt of the Himalaya, as postulated by some workers. Geodynamically Salt Range and Potwar basins belong to northern parts of the Indus Foreland Basin, because the depositional basin from Potwar extending into the adjacent Kohat area during the Paleocene and the Eocene time probably formed a collision zone between the India-Pakistan plate and a micro-continent prior to the collision of the former with Asia. The micro-continent possibly buffered intensity of collision, thereby, there was no tectono-magmatic activity along this belt as distinct from that of direct collision between India and Asia continent.

AB The late Eocene-early Oligocene Laisong Formation, basal Barail Group from the Naga Hills, Indo-Burma Range has yielded a low diversity of trace fossils i.e. Chondrites, ?Gyrolithes, Ophiomorpha, Palaeophycus, Planolites and Thalassinoides. Three ichnofabrics namely Ophiomorpha-Palaeophycus, Thalassinoides and Chondrites-Planolites have been identified. The Ophiomorpha-Palaeophycus ichnofabric grades upsection into Chondrites-Planolites ichnofabric in a fine to medium grained sandstone unit through a succession of alternating thinly bedded sandstone and mudstone containing Thalassinoides ichnofabric. The ichnofabric distribution is primarily controlled by the change in depositional energy levels from low to high. A low diversity trace fossils and lack of graphoglyptids in the Laisong Formation of Naga Hills supports the presence of a proximal part of the hyperpycnal lobes of delta-fed marine coarse-grained turbidite system.

AB Murree Formation lies in the core of Hazara Kashmir Syntaxis, Sub-Himalayas, Pakistan. In the Muzaffarabad area, the Murree Formation extends from Ghori to Nauseri. The Early Miocene Murree Formation is underlain unconformably by the Ypresian to Early Lutetian Kuldana Formation and is in a fault contact with the Permian Panjal Formation. The Murree Formation contains litharenite and feldspathic litharenite. All of the plots in the QtFL diagram fall in recycled orogen provenance field, whereas ternary diagram (QmFLt) also suggests transitional recycled to quartzose recycled orogenic provenance for the sandstone of Murree Formation. Orogenic recycling occurs in the Lesser and Higher Himalayas where stratified rocks are deformed, uplifted and eroded. The detritus was then deposited in the Himalayan Foreland Basin by river meandering system. The detritus of rock fragments strongly suggests mixed sources of the Murree Formation sandstones. The modal analysis data were plotted in a diamond diagram for the recognition of the sediment source and tectonic setting of the provenance. The frequency of the non-undulatory monocrystalline quartz (Qnu) is larger in the sandstone as compared to the frequency of the undulatory monocrystalline quartz (Qu) and polycrystalline quartz (Qp). The greater abundance of Qnu suggests plutonic provenance for these sandstones. The plot of Q/(F + L) against Qp/(F + L) reveals that during the deposition of Murree Formation, the climatic conditions were semi-arid to semi humid. The XRD analyses of shale samples indicate quartz, carbonate and clays vary from 66-89%, 1-25% and 1-21%, respectively.

AB The Lower Siwalik sequence in south-eastern Uttarakhand state of India records fluvial sedimentation during middle Miocene in the Himalayan foreland basin. Three distinct lithofacies associations (`A', 'B' and 'C') have been identified, each one of which comprises one or more of the eight major lithofacies and points to specific sub-environments of fluvial depositional setting. The lithofacies association 'A' is sandstone dominated and suggests deposition mainly by 0.09-2.0 m/s flowing traction currents in braided streams. The lithofacies association 'B' is sandstone-mudstone dominated and suggests deposition by 0.1-1.0 m/s flowing traction currents as well as suspension fallout in meandering streams and adjoining overbank areas. The facies association 'C' is mudstone dominated, characteristically pedogenically altered and disassociated with any major channel sandstone body. It represents reworking of pre-deposited sediments by ephemeral sheet and shallow channelized flows in the upland interfluve regions. The palaeoflow pattern reveals regional radial outward sediment dispersal by a distributary fluvial system, indicating convex-up transverse surface profile. The dominance of fine- to medium-grained sand and general absence of coarser extrabasinal clasts suggests that this distributive fluvial system of meandering and braided streams was located in the middle-distal part of a megafan. The upland interfluve surface developed following the cessation of megafan surface aggradation due to incision of major river channels.

AB Despite sporadic fieldwork for nearly a century, the Middle Miocene hominoid locality of Ramnagar (Jammu and Kashmir, India) is still not well understood in terms of its taphonomy and paleoecology. Between 2010-2015, we collected a large number of vertebrate, invertebrate and plant fossil remains from seven sites in the Ramnagar area: Bassi, Kulwanta, Sunetar, Dehari, Thaplal, Nambela and Mata. Taphonomic analyses based on factors such as the number of vertebrate skeletal elements present, taxonomic diversity, degree of completeness (articulation or disarticulation), abrasion, breakage, weathering, and presence/absence of scavenging or carnivore marks lead us to conclude that these fossils experienced short distance transportation and accumulation by fluvial processes. On the basis of the principle of actualism, these fossil assemblages indicate small streams, ponds/pools, swamps, and tropical rain forests developed under warm and humid conditions, with the possibility of more open environments nearby.

AB The freshwater Siwalik deposits of the Himalayan foreland basin have long been known to yield prolific Miocene-Pleistocene mammalian fauna. Overwhelming of this data comes from the Siwalik sequence of Pakistan, where good palaeomagnetic control is available for various Siwalik lithounits. In contrast limited data on fossil mammals, more so on small mammals, is available from the Indian side of the Siwalik, where even most of the Siwalik formations lack palaeomagnetic and or radiometric calibration, despite the fact that several fossil yielding localities are known in India since long. In the present research work, small mammals discovered from a Lower Siwalik locality near Ramnagar town in Jammu province, Jammu and Kashmir State, India are reported and their age implication is discussed. The mammal fauna from the study area contains four species of rodents belonging to four subfamilies. These include Rhizomyinae represented by Kanisamys indices, Ctenodactylinae by Sayimys sivalensis, Myomiminae by Myominuis sp. and Xerinae by Tamias urialis. The recovered biotas improve our knowledge on the rodent diversity of the Indian Lower Siwalik Subgroup and contribute to further constrain the age of the fossiliferous horizon between 13.6 and 13.2 Ma. The new fauna suggests a humid, forested palaeoecological setting.

AB In case of freshwater deposits that cannot be isotopically dated or that lack a continuous sequence for magnetostratigraphic study, rodent biochronology is an useful tool in making intra-regional biostratigraphic correlations and dating isolated Siwalik fossil localities within the Himalayan Foreland Basin. We here, report a new fossil locality exposed near the Village Devni Khadri situated close to the Markanda River Valley (District Sirmaur, Himachal Pradesh, India). This Upper Siwalik locality belonging to the Tatrot Formation contains a diverse fauna and flora including large mammals, birds, crocodiles, fishes, gastropods, bivalves, ostracods and charophytes beside dental remains of murid rodents Golunda kellen, Mus fiynni, Mus jacobsi and Abudhabia cf. A. kabulense. Based on the biostratigraphic ranges of these murid rodents from well dated Siwalik and Karewa localities, this richly fossiliferous locality has been placed here at similar to 3 Ma. The new age facilitates regional correlation and a revision of stratigraphic placement of rodent bearing Plio-Pleistocene Indian sites. A PAUP based cladistic analysis of fossil and extant Golunda and its relatives suggest the monophyly of the Golunda group, and a close relationship between African and Asian forms. Presence of common rodent elements in the fossil record of Africa and Asia points towards possible inter -continental dispersal in Pliocene time.

AB The central Himalaya has attracted much attention due to its potential to host a great earthquake an inference based on the history of earthquakes and the geodetic slip estimates. The largest and earliest historically documented earthquake in the central Himalaya occurred in 1803 (M similar to 7.7) near Uttarkashi on its western part, much before the great event of 1934 (Mw 8.2, located farther to the east) - both of which were felt severely in the Gangetic Plain south of the mountain front. The seismotectonic model by Seeber and Armbruster (1981) predicts that large/great earthquakes originate on the Main Himalayan Thrust (MHT) and their ruptures propagate southward to the Main Frontal Thrust (MFT). The rupture of the April 25, 2015 (Mw 7.8) Gorkha (Nepal) earthquake, however, was southeast-directed with a southwest-directed slip, and its Mw 7.3 aftershock on May 12 also showed a similar slip direction. Post-2015, we revisited the 1991 Uttarkashi (Mw 6.7) and the 1999 Chamoli (Mw 6.5) earthquakes in India, both of which had originated on the MHT flat, but show SSW-directed slips, as reported in this study. Ruptures of both these earthquakes fell short of reaching the MFT, just as the historically documented 1803 earthquake, but their shaking effects were felt in the southern plains. These observations compel us to conclude that the varying rupture modes exhibited by the Himalayan earthquakes are controlled primarily by the geometry of the flat-ramp-flat system.

AB Tectonic reactivation along the major boundary thrusts and subsidiary thrust/faults in the Himalaya during the Quaternary period has resulted in the rejuvenation of the landforms. Considering, the role of neotectonic activity in the hazardous Kumaun region, we aim to study the neotectonically formed landscape along the Kulur River valley, a non glacier fed tributary of the Saryu River in the zone of the Berinag Thrust (BT). The field evidences encompassing a variety of geomorphic indicators, e.g., unpaired fluvial terraces, palaeo river channels, alluvial fans, active and stabilized landslides, lineaments, waterfalls, alignment of springs, deeply dissected hills, straight/meandering course of rivers/streams, V-shaped valleys, triangular fault facets and water logged/river ponding along with integrated values of eight morphometric parameters and Stream Steepness index (Ks) indices characterize the modification of landscape in the Kulur River valley. The computed morphometric parameters in the Kulur River drainage and its tributaries show that the basin has been tilted and uplifted forming V-shaped valleys along with deformed and disequilibrium longitudinal profile, thereof, suggesting it to be controlled by lithology and tectonics. Based on the response of active tectonics in form of geomorphic features and quantitative measurements of river channels, the entire basin has been divided into three segments in which the northern and southern segments are active compared to the middle sector. A possible NNE-SSW trending lineament/fault, running parallel to the Kulur River has been observed in the upper catchment and is characterized by fluvial terraces, river ponding and deflection and offsetting of drainage with rectangular pattern etc. This may have given rise to the widening and straightening of river courses which provide the favorable room for river ponding, resulting in deposition of about 2 m thick lacustrine mud deposit.

AB Understanding the processes of ravine formation and estimates of Specific Sediment Yields (SSY) of these regions help in formulating mitigation policies significantly. Upto now, in the Ganga Plain, the work done on ravine formation, erosion and SSY estimates has been speculative. Here, utilizing (i) high resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) prepared from Real Time Kinematic (RTK) survey and CARTOSAT images of ravined zones and (ii) luminescence chronology, we provide the first estimate of SSY from the ravines. The results indicate that SSY in the Marginal Ganga Plain (MGP) ravines may range between 600 +/- 100 t/km(2)/yr and 1600 +/- 200 t/km(2)/Yr.
   The correspondence between the orientations of fractures and that of first order ravine suggests that the ravine growth is genetically related to extensional stress regime of the peripheral forebulge. Further, the clay sedimentology indicates that besides regional tectonics, action of swelling clays may have accelerated development of the badlands. The geomorphic relationship between the length of ravined catchments and incision in the trunk channels indicates that the river-incision associated base level change is not playing an overarching role in the ravine formation in the MGP.

AB We present a stalagmite based high resolution climatic record between similar to 4.0 and 1.9 ka BP from Dharamjali Cave in Pithoragarh (Kumaun Himalaya), an area which is influenced primarily by the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) and supplemented by the Indian Winter Monsoon (IWM). The chronology of the 41.5 cm long DH-1 stalagmite was constructed using a StalAge model on six Th-230/U dates. However, some samples have higher Th-232 concentrations, leading to an increase in the final age uncertainties, hence the chronology supports only the possible climatic boundaries. However, the significance of this work lies in its being one of the rare studies of speleothems to reconstruct high resolution climatic changes in the NW India for the Upper Holocene. The delta O-18 values, ranging between - 5.3 parts per thousand and -10 parts per thousand, show a large variation, compared to the areas dominated by a single monsoon, and this can be ascribed to the two sources of moisture (e.g., ISM and IWM) in the study area during the Upper Holocene. The sample consists of aragonite except for two sections of calcite growth from 0-7.3 cm and 8.5-13.5 cm from the top. The climatic reconstruction, within the age uncertainties, indicates strengthened precipitation from 4.0 ka BP with a sharp drop ( > - 2 parts per thousand) in delta O-18 values, peaking at similar to 3.7 ka BP. A gradual decline in precipitation is observed from similar to 3.7 to 3.0 ka BP with possible droughts, centered at similar to 3.4, similar to 3.2 and similar to 3.0 ka BP. Subsequently, climatic amelioration took place between similar to 3.0 and 2.9 ka BP, showing fluctuating trend in delta O-18 values with comparatively more rainfall, possibly generated by the IWM in the form of thunderstorms and hailstorms from similar to 2.9 to 2.7 ka BP. Precipitation declined from similar to 2.7 to 2.4 ka BP with a decadal scale major drought event, strongest in the present data set, at similar to 2.5-2.4 ka BP, whereas, an abrupt drop in stalagmite delta O-18 values from similar to 2.4 to 2.3 ka BP points to increased precipitation intensity. Thereafter, the precipitation gradually decreased until ca. 2.1 ka BP with one of the driest events at similar to 2.1 ka BP. A century scale increasing trend in the precipitation intensity is observed from similar to 2.1 to 2.0 ka BP, following which the precipitation again declined. Accordingly, five sudden drought events are documented, centering at similar to 3.4, similar to 3.2, similar to 3.0, similar to 2.5-2.4 and similar to 2.1 ka BP. A gradual reduction in precipitation from similar to 3.7 to 3.0 ka BP coincides with reduction and deurbanisation and step -wise disintegration of the Harappan civilization along the Indus-Ghaggar-Sarasvati valleys in the foreland areas of northwestern India.

ID SILICA GLASS; DEFORMATION; INDENTATIONS
AB The contact deformation mechanisms were explored for a series of 15CaO 15Al(2)O(3) xB(2)O(3) (70-x)SiO2 glasses exhibiting intermediate indentation behavior. These glasses are defined as intermediate since they deform with significantly higher densification than the comparative normal glass, soda-lime silicate, and significantly more shear deformation that the comparative anomalous glass, Corning 7980 fused silica. Berkovich scratch testing at 30 mN shows that 50% of the scratch impression area is displaced into the pileup region for the normal soda-lime silicate glass, while only 9% of the scratch impression area is displaced into the pileup region for anomalous silica glass. For the series of intermediate glasses studied from x = 5 to x = 25, the scratch area displaced into the pileup region was constant within measurement error at approximately 30%. Since the displaced volume indicates the amount of shear deformation, the relative amounts of shear and densification are considered constant across the intermediate glass series. However, the indentation cracking thresholds are significantly different for the intermediate glasses with the x = 25 endpoint requiring a 3 kgf load to produce median/radial cracks, whereas the x = 5 endpoint glass required only 1 kgf to produce median/radial cracks. A cross-sectional view of the x = 25 glass shows that that deformation occurs with high shear band density, however, these shear bands have not progressed into shear faults. The shear band density and crack resistance both increase as the B2O3 content increases for the 15CaO 15Al(2)O(3) xB(2)O(3) (70-x)SiO2 glass series.

AB Optical and FTIR spectral investigations of prepared undoped and WO3-or MoO3-doped glasses from ZnO-CdO-P2O5 glassy system were carried out before and after irradiation with a dose of 8 Mrad (= 8 x 10(4) Gy). The optical spectrum of the undoped glass reveals strong UV absorption band due to trace ferric ions present as trace impurity within the chemicals. The WO3 or MoO3-doped glasses show additional UV-visible bands due to the dominance presence of the low valence states of the two transition metal (TM) ions (M3+, M4+, M5+). Gamma irradiation extends and increases the UV absorption due to suggested photochemical reactions of ferrous iron present as impurity to react with positive holes during the irradiation process to transfer to additional ferric ions possessing their absorption in the UV region. The TM-doped glasses show some shielding behavior in almost the persistence of the visible spectra due to the TM ions. FTIR spectral bands are related to phosphate groups (mainly Q(2) and Q(3) units) in accordance with the high content of P2O5 (70 mol%). The effects of dopant ions on the IR spectra are limited due to the low percent (0.25 to 0.75 g/100 g) and their presence in modifying positions. Gamma irradiation decreases the intensity of some IR bands due to OH, water vibrations present mainly in terminal sites.

AB Sol-gel-derived bioactive glasses obtained via sol-gel can exhibit inherent structural ordering even below the glass-transition temperature (T-g) depending on the levels of modifier and intermediate oxides that are included in their composition. To answer whether this previous structural ordering can affect their surface reactivity, we synthesized two distinct systems that are known to present ordering below the T-g: a standard bioactive glass without MgO [Na2O-CaO-P2O5-SiO2] and another that contained different MgO proportions in substitution for CaO [Na2O-CaO(MgO)-P2O5-SiO2]. The bioactive glass without MgO suffered an ordering process below the T-g with the formation of nanocrystalline apatite domains. The insertion of MgO caused the ordering of nanocrystalline Mg2+ -containing beta-tricalcium phosphate domains. After immersion in a complex medium (McCoy's 5A modified culture medium), the MgO -containing bioactive glass had a higher apatite precipitation rate than the bioactive glass without MgO. Although the MgO reduced the T-g, the increased precipitation was not caused directly by the decrease in T-g but rather by the previous presence of the ordered phase. Additionally, the layer precipitated onto the MgO -containing bioactive glass presented a higher level of Mg2+ and CO32- ions, suggesting the formation of an Mg2+ -containing carbonate apatite similar to that observed in bone tissue. Therefore, the inherent ordering of sol-gel-derived bioactive glasses below the T-g can define their bioactivity, which constitutes a consistent way of controlling their surface reactivity.

Nature amorphosity of these glasses was confirmed via X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements. UV-visible absorption spectra within the 200-1100 sun wavelength range of these samples were performed. The direct/indirect optical energy gap (E-g(opt)), Urbach energy (E-u), Fermi energy (E-F) were calculated. Both the optical complex dielectric constant (epsilon), and the optical conductivity (sigma(opt)) for the prepared glass samples were calculated by using the measured refractive index (n) and extinction coefficient (k). All the optical properties vary depending on the SnO2 content in borate glass samples. Refractive index (n) and the optical conductivity (sigma(opt)) increase with increasing SnO2 concentration. Dielectric measurements depict that both the dielectric constant (epsilon ') and dielectric loss (epsilon '') decrease with the increasing of frequency but a constant value was obtained beyond 10 kHz up to 100 kHz. However, ac conductivity (sigma(ac)) increases with the increasing in frequency.

AB Oxynitride phosphate glasses and glass-ceramics were prepared using new synthesis routes for phosphate glasses. Materials were melted from pre-prepared glass samples in the system Na-Ca-P-0 with addition of Mg and/or Si3N4 powders under different preparation conditions. The melting process was conducted at 1000-1500 degrees C either under air or nitrogen atmosphere to obtain materials with different nitrogen content. Their topography and structure were characterized by Confocal Microscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy, X-ray powder diffraction and Raman and infrared spectroscopy techniques, while their chemical compositions were examined by Energy Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). All materials prepared under nitrogen atmosphere were found to contain a relative low quantity of nitrogen and high amount of Nb leached from the crucible. The reaction with the Nb crucible was not previously observed for silicon-based oxynitride glasses. The synthesized materials form two groups: glasses and glass-ceramics. The first ones, were prepared under air and nitrogen atmospheres at temperatures up to 1400 degrees C, and were found to be amorphous and homogeneous. Raman and infrared spectroscopy measurements confirm the presence of amorphous phosphates in the synthesized materials. The samples of the second group were prepared at temperatures above 1400 degrees C and were found to be translucent and partially crystallized. They contain nanocrystallites of calcium and sodium phosphates including hydroxyapatite (HAp). The thermal properties of samples were studied by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). The obtained glass transition temperatures range from about 360 degrees C to 640 degrees C and exhibit high values for glass-ceramic materials. Stability is improved in the studied glass-ceramics because of the increased degree of network polymerization of the remaining glassy matrix. The approximate fragility index decreases two times for oxynitride materials compared to the primary glass. The synthesized new materials may be competitive to well-known bioactive phosphate glasses thanks to their improved stability by Mg, Si, N and Nb doping.

AB Oxide glasses pose high theoretical strength originating from their strong ionocovalent bonding, but they experience amplification of tensile stresses around defects under tensile loading and lack efficient stress dissipation mechanisms. Consequently, glasses exhibit low practical strength and fracture toughness, limiting the scope of their applications. Different strengthening and reinforcement approaches have thus been tested, but relatively little success has been achieved with respect to making the glasses intrinsically more ductile through composition optimization. Following earlier literature reports, a possible route to achieve this would be to prepare glasses with high Poisson's ratio above similar to 0.32. Yet, no oxide glasses with such high Poisson's ratio have been reported and the mechanical properties of oxide glasses with Poisson's ratio >= 0.30 are poorly understood. In this paper, we synthesize 25%La2O3-15%Al2O3-60%B2O3, 25%La2O3-15%Al2O3-60%SiO2, and 25% La2O3-15%Al2O3-60%GeO2 glasses (fractions in mol%), all exhibiting high Poisson's ratio values (similar to 0.30). We evaluate the mechanical properties, including elastic moduli, Poisson's ratio, hardness, and resistance to indentation cracking of the as-prepared as well as densified glasses. In addition, the indentation deformation mechanism of the glasses along with the accompanying underlying structural changes is investigated. This study therefore presents insight into the composition-property relations of high Poisson's ratio glasses, which may be used in future design of ductile oxide glasses with potential applications in electronic devices, optical fibers, and load-bearing components of buildings or other constructions.

AB A novel mathematical algorithm was developed to calculate refractive index (n + ik) from specular reflectance infrared (SR-IR) spectra in the strongly-absorbing glass network vibration region. The method is named as two angle SR-IR (TASR-IR), since it is based on the Fresnel equations of specular reflectance at two incidence angles (10 degrees and 45 degrees). The results obtained from TASR-IR are comparable with the values obtained from spectroscopic ellipsometry. The TASR-IR method allows one to obtain the peak positions and intensities of fundamental network vibration modes of glass from the imaginary component (k) of complex refractive index without convolutions from the dispersion effect due to chains in the real component (n) of refractive index. The TASR-IR method is applied to silica, silicate, borosilicate, and boroaluminosilicate glasses; tentative peak assignments of glass network vibrations are proposed. The origin and concept of peaks in the vibrational spectra of glasses is discussed.

AB In predictive analytics and statistics, entities are frequently treated as individual actors. However, in reality this assumption is not valid. In the context of retail, similar customers will behave and thus also purchase similarly to each other. By combining their behavior in an intelligent way, based on transaction history, we can leverage these connections and improve our ability to predict purchase outcomes. As such, we can create customer-product networks from which we can deduce information on customers expressing similar purchasing behavior. This allows us to exploit their preferences and predict which products are going to be sold significantly less often. We want to use this information mainly for gaining novel marketing insights on products. For example, if customers refrain from buying products this might be due to contextual reasons such as new complements or supplements, or new nearby shops. By using these networks on data from an offline European retail corporation, we are able to boost performance of the predictive models by 6% and the identification of these specific products by 20%. This indicates that the development of customer-product graphs in retail can lead to improved marketing intelligence. To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to use customer-product networks for predictive modeling in an offline retail setting. Furthermore, we suggest an extensive set of product and network features which can guide future researchers and practitioners in their model development. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Despite the imitability of the signatures due to presence of numerous image processing programs, online verification systems could provide sufficient security for e-signatures. Recent developments in touch screen technology and android programming also lead to utilization of hidden interfaces stealthily collecting the unique characteristics and storing the key features aside from geometrics. Therefore, we initially designed a signing interface for touchscreens which stealthily collects the precise coordinates while an individual is signing on the screen by fingertips. Even if the coordinate data is extracted as a matrix consisting of x and y values with corresponding time, the speed array is consequently calculated to investigate the higher frequency regions. The speed data processed by continuous wavelet transformations (CWT) to reveal the frequency information of the signing speed with respect to time information. The grayscale spectrograms created by wavelet transforms are converted into arrays for subsequent training session performed by support vector machines (SVM). The trained network successfully classified further attempts of the real and fake signatures with 1.67% false negative (FNR), 3.33% false positive rates (FPR) and 3.41% equal error rate (EER) for 120 signatures, even though the signature is totally public. For understanding the validity of the CWT and SVM running consecutively, the experiments are re-conducted for the signatures taken from SVC2004 and SUSIG public databases. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

ID DATA STREAM CLASSIFICATION; CHANGING ENVIRONMENTS; ENSEMBLE;

AB One popular approach employed to tackle classification problems in a static environment consists in using a Dynamic Classifier Selection (DCS)-based method to select a custom classifier/ensemble for each test instance according to its neighborhood in a validation set, where the selection can be considered region-dependent. This idea can be extended to concept drift scenarios, where the distribution or the a posteriori probabilities may change over time. Nevertheless, in these scenarios, the classifier selection becomes not only region but also time-dependent. By adding a time dependency, in this work, we hypothesize that any DCS-based approach can be used to handle concept drift problems. Since some regions may not be affected by a concept drift, we introduce the idea of concept diversity, which shows that a pool containing classifiers trained under different concepts may be beneficial when dealing with concept drift problems through a DCS approach. The impacts of pruning mechanisms are discussed and seven well-known DCS methods are evaluated in the proposed framework, using a robust experimental protocol based on,12 common concept drift problems with different properties, and the PKLot dataset considering an experimental protocol specially designed in this work to test concept drift methods. The experimental results have shown that the DCS approach comes out ahead in terms of stability, i.e., it performs well in most cases requiring almost no parameter tuning. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper presents original solutions from the field of intelligent expert systems for use in behavioral biometrics. They combine possibilities offered by biometric methods with the theory of fuzzy sets and the theory of population-based algorithms. Behavioral biometrics is concerned with learned behaviors such as a way of signing, movement, speaking, etc. However, these attributes trend to change over time. This is particularly important in a variety of fields including identity authentication. In this paper we present a new approach to the analysis of changes in behavioral characteristics. The purpose of the proposed approach is to predict values of features describing the so-called dynamic signature. It is the signature represented by waveforms describing a number of features including pen pressure and velocity. The proposed approach can be particularly useful in cases in which the interval between signature acquisition sessions is long. Our approach was tested with the use of the dynamic signature database called ATV-SSLT DB. It seems that the solutions proposed in this paper offer a new and interesting look at the solution of the problem of variability (aging) of biometric features. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In recommender systems users interact with items, while their preferences evolve over time. The challenge is how to identify the correlation between users' recent and past preferences to generate accurate recommendations. In this study, we propose a Multi-Latent Transition (MLT) model. We formulate a joint objective function to calculate the multiple transitions between an ongoing period with users' latest preferences and all the past ones, considering the multiple transitions at the user latent space of the different periods. The joint problem is solved via an efficient gradient-based alternating optimization algorithm, with convergence guarantees. Furthermore, to better capture the correlation between the ongoing period and a past one we also exploit items' metadata, accounting for the fact that users may have stable preferences over time as they may like certain attributes of items e.g., an actor or a movie director, or radically shift their preferences because they dislike them. Our experiments show that MLT significantly outperforms state-of-the art methods and boosts the recommendation accuracy for users with stable preferences and for users that tend to shift their preferences often.

AB Epilepsy is the second common brain disorder affecting 70 million people worldwide. Electroencephalogram (EEG) has been widely used for the diagnosis of epileptic seizures. However, most of the existing EEG-based seizure detection methods cannot maintain robust performance in real life conditions. This is where the EEG data are corrupted with different sources of noise and artifacts. This study presents a robust seizure detection system that works efficiently under the real life conditions as well as the ideal conditions. A feature learning method based on L1-penalized robust regression is developed and applied to the EEG spectra to recognize the most prominent features pertinent to epileptic seizures. The extracted features are then fed into the random forest classifier for seizure detection. Results on a public benchmark dataset show that the performance of this seizure detection system is superior to prior work. It first achieves seizure detection rates of 100.00% sensitivity, 100.00% specificity, and 100.00% classification accuracy under the ideal conditions. The proposed method is also proven to be robust in the presence of white noise and EEG artifacts mainly those arising from muscle activities and eyes-blinking. It is found to achieve seizure detection accuracies in the range of 90.00-100.00% when applied to noisy EEG data corrupted with high noise levels. To the best of our knowledge, there exists no work in the literature that detects seizures under these conditions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Social image annotation, which aims at inferring a set of semantic concepts for a social image, is an effective and straightforward way to facilitate social image search. Conventional approaches mainly demonstrated on adopting the visual features and tags, without considering other types of metadata. How to enhance the accuracy of social image annotation by fully exploiting multi-modal features is still an opening and challenging problem. In this paper, we propose an improved Multi-Modal Data Fusion based Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model (MMDF-LDA) to annotate social images via fusing visual content, user-supplied tags, user comments, and geographic information. When MMDF-LDA samples annotations for one data modality, all the other data modalities are exploited. In MMDF-LDA, geographical topics are generated from GPS locations of social images, and annotations have different probability to be used in different geographical regions. A social image is divided into several patches in advance, and then MMDF-LDA assigns annotations for the patches of social images by estimating the probability of annotation-patch assignment. Through experiments in social image annotation and retrieval on several datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MMDF-LDA model in comparison with stateof-the-art methods.

AB One of the major issues in industrial environments is currently maximizing productivity while reducing manufacturing cost. This can be seen clearly reflected in mixed-model assembly lines based systems, where obtaining efficient manufacturing sequences is a key to be competitive in a dynamic and globalized market. However, this continuous cost reduction and productivity growth should not penalize the welfare of employees. This work is intended to address this lack of compatibility between the economic and social objectives through the study of the mixed-model sequencing problem from both the business and labor perspective. This is done by considering the possibility of reducing or increasing processing times of operations by varying the work pace of line's operators within the permissible legal boundaries. Thus, depending on this flexible activation time of operators, the amount of completed work and idle time will be one or the other and, consequently, the productivity of the line will also improve or get worse. In this regard, we propose new approach to the sequencing problem without incurring cost increases and providing a safe working environment, in accordance with applicable law. This new approach leads to obtain efficient manufacturing sequences, in terms of both productivity and labor conditions. Specifically, the objective of the new problem is minimizing the unproductive costs of the line by incorporating the possibility of increasing production through the variation of the work pace of line's operators. Increasing the work pace of operators, the amount of non-completed work or the preventable idle time can be reduced and therefore, their associated costs too. In addition, and without losing sight of the effort involved in working with a work pace above the normal, we propose several economic criteria to compensate the activation of workers where necessary.

ID OPTIMIZATION
AB Bat algorithm (BA) is a heuristic optimization algorithm based on swarm intelligence and the inspiration from the nature behavior of bats. It has some advantages including fast solving speed, high precision and only few parameters need to be adjusted. However, BA is easy to fall into local optima and has unstable optimization results due to low global exploration ability. In order to overcome these weakness, a new bat algorithm based on iterative local search and stochastic inertia weight (ILSSIWBA) is proposed in this paper. A kind of local search algorithm, called iterative local search (ILS) is introduced into the proposed algorithm. The ILS algorithm disturbs the local optimum and do some local re-search, so that the ILSSIWBA has strong ability to jump out of the local optima. In addition, a weight updating method, called stochastic inertia weight (SIW) is also introduced into the proposed algorithm. Considering the SIW in the velocity updating equation can enhance the diversity and flexibility of bat population, so that the ILSSIWBA has stable optimization results. Meanwhile, the pulse rate and loudness are modified to enhance the balance performance between global and local search. Moreover, the global convergence of ILSSIWBA is proved by the convergence criteria of stochastic algorithm. In the end, the ILSSIWBA is compared with directional bat algorithm (DBA) and other algorithms on 10 classic benchmark functions, CEC 2005 benchmark suite, and two real-world problems. The results show that ILSSIWBA has remarkable advantages in optimization accuracy, solving speed and convergence stability. This algorithm lays a solid foundation for solving modeling, optimization and control problems of complex systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Genetic Programming (GP) is gaining increased attention as an effective method for inducing classifiers for data classification. However, the manual design of a genetic programming classification algorithm is a non-trivial time consuming process. This research investigates the hypothesis that automating the design of a GP classification algorithm for data classification can still lead to the induction of effective classifiers and also reduce the design time. Two evolutionary algorithms, namely, a genetic algorithm (GA) and grammatical evolution (GE) are used to automate the design of GP classification algorithms. The classification performance of the automated designed GP classifiers i.e. GA designed GP classifiers and GE designed GP classifiers are compared to each other and to manually designed GP classifiers on real-world problems. Furthermore, a comparison of the design times of automated design and manual design is also carried out for the same set of problems. The automated designed classifiers were found to outperform manually designed classifiers across problem domains. Automated design time is also found to be less than manual design time. This study revealed that for the considered datasets GE performs better for binary classification while the GA does better for multiclass classification. Overall the results of the study are in support of the hypothesis. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID DESCRIPTOR
AB Usage of depth data in various computer vision applications gains popularity with cheap depth sensors available on the market. In this study, a method that utilizes Deep Learning is proposed for single human actions and dyadic actions. Depth data of the actions are used to construct a three-dimensional (3D) template. These templates are rotated in different directions and two-dimensional (2D) views from different angles are stored. Acquired 2D images are used in deep feature extraction. AlexNet (Krizhevsky, Sutskever, & Hinton, 2012) pre-trained convolutional neural network is used for deep feature extraction. For all viewpoints, deep features are extracted and concatenated. After that random forest classifier is used for action recognition. The contributions of this paper are as follows. First, a 3D isosurface models is constructed to figure actions sequence. Second, we project 3D shapes into a 2D feature space by taking its snapshots from different views and giving them to a pre-trained CNN as input for feature extraction. We explore more information about the actions by extracting features from different layers of the deep neural network. We compare the results of the deep features extracted from different layers of the pre-trained CNN. Various classifiers are trained with extracted deep features. Because of the complex structure of the 3D shapes, there are a limited number of feature extraction methods. Our method obtains close to state-of-the-art performance on various single and two-person action datasets. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB While convergent technology has been booming recently, drones are being applied in various fields of industry and are expected to be used as a commercial delivery method. In a delivery system, routing becomes one of the major issues, and several studies have attempted to solve drone-based routing problems. In this study, we focus on finding an effective delivery route for trucks carrying drones. To put it concretely, we propose a new approach on a nonlinear programming model to find shift-weights that move the centers of clusters to make for wider drone-delivery areas along shorter truck-route after initial K-means clustering and TSP (Traveling Salesman Problem) modeling. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model with shift-weights, we compare it with two other delivery route approaches. One is a route without shift-weights after K-means clustering and TSP modeling, and the other is a route by TSP for all delivery locations without K-means clustering. Through experimental results of paired t-tests on randomly generated delivery locations, we show that our proposed model is more effective than the other two models. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB We propose a numerical methodology for the numerical simulation of distinct, interacting physical processes described by a combination of compressible, inert and reactive forms of the Euler equations, multiphase equations and elastoplastic equations. These systems of equations are usually solved by coupling finite element and CFD models. Here we solve them simultaneously, by recasting all the equations in the same, hyperbolic form and solving them on the same grid with the same finite-volume numerical schemes. The proposed compressible, multiphase, hydrodynamic formulation can employ a hierarchy of five reactive and non-reactive flow models, which allows simple to more involved applications to be directly described by the appropriate selection. The communication between the hydrodynamic and elastoplastic systems is facilitated by means of mixed-material Riemann solvers at the boundaries of the systems, which represent physical material boundaries. To this end we derive approximate mixed Riemann solvers for each pair of the above models based on characteristic equations. The components for reactive flow and elastoplastic solid modelling are validated separately before presenting validation for the full, coupled systems. Multi-dimensional use cases demonstrate the suitability of the reactive flow-solid interaction methodology in the context of impact-driven initiation of reactive flow and structural response due to violent reaction in automotive (e.g. car crash) or defence (e.g. explosive reactive armour) applications. Several types of explosives (C4, Detasheet, nitromethane, gaseous fuel) in gaseous, liquid and solid state are considered. (c) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB We develop a new approach for solving stochastic quantum master equations with mixed initial states. First, we obtain that the solution of the jump-diffusion stochastic master equation is represented by a mixture of pure states satisfying a system of stochastic differential equations of Schrodinger type. Then, we design three exponential schemes for these coupled stochastic Schrodinger equations, which are driven by Brownian motions and jump processes. Hence, we have constructed efficient numerical methods for the stochastic master equations based on quantum trajectories. The good performance of the new numerical integrators is illustrated by simulations of two quantum measurement processes. (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We investigate a gradient enhanced l(1)-minimization for constructing sparse polynomial chaos expansions. In addition to function evaluations, measurements of the function gradient is also included to accelerate the identification of expansion coefficients. By designing appropriate preconditioners to the measurement matrix, we show gradient enhanced l(1) minimization leads to stable and accurate coefficient recovery. The framework for designing preconditioners is quite general and it applies to recover of functions whose domain is bounded or unbounded. Comparisons between the gradient enhanced approach and the standard l(1)-minimization are also presented and numerical examples suggest that the inclusion of derivative information can guarantee sparse recovery at a reduced computational cost.

AB In this paper, we propose an enriched Galerkin (EG) approximation for a two-phase pressure saturation system with capillary pressure in heterogeneous porous media. The EG methods are locally conservative, have fewer degrees of freedom compared to discontinuous Galerkin (DG), and have an efficient pressure solver. To avoid non-physical oscillations, an entropy viscosity stabilization method is employed for high order saturation approximations. Entropy residuals are applied for dynamic mesh adaptivity to reduce the computational cost for larger computational domains. The iterative and sequential IMplicit Pressure and Explicit Saturation (IMPES) algorithms are treated in time. Numerical examples with different relative permeabilities and capillary pressures are included to verify and to demonstrate the capabilities of EG. (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Langevin equations describe systems driven by internally generated or externally imposed random excitations. If these excitations correspond to Gaussian white noise, it is relatively straightforward to derive a closed form equation for the joint probability density function (PDF) of state variables. Many natural phenomena present however correlated (colored) excitations. For such problems, a full probabilistic characterization through the resolution of a PDF equation can be obtained through two levels of approximations: first, mixed ensemble moments have to be approximated to lead to a closed system of equations and, second, the resulting nonlocal equations should be at least partially localized to ensure computational efficiency. We propose a new semi-local formulation based on a modified large-eddy diffusivity (LED) approach; the formulation retains most of the accuracy of a fully nonlocal approach while presenting the same order of algorithmic complexity as the standard LED approach. The accuracy of the approach is successfully tested against Monte Carlo simulations. (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Uncertainty quantification is an emerging research area aiming at quantifying the variation in engineering system outputs due to uncertain inputs. One approach to study problems in uncertainty quantification is using polynomial chaos expansions. Though, a well-known limitation of polynomial chaos approaches is that their computational cost becomes prohibitive when the dimension of the stochastic space is large. In this paper, we propose a procedure to solve high dimensional stochastic problems with a limited computational budget. The methodology is based on an existing non-intrusive model reduction scheme for polynomial chaos representation, introduced by Raisee et al. [1], that is further extended by introducing sparse polynomial chaos expansions. Specifically, an optimal stochastic basis is calculated from a coarse scale analysis, using proper orthogonal decomposition and sparse polynomial chaos and is then utilized in the fine scale analysis. This way, the computational expense on both the coarse and fine discretization levels is drastically reduced. Two application examples are considered to validate the proposed method and demonstrate its potential in solving high dimensional uncertainty quantification problems. One analytical stochastic problems is first studied, where up to 20 uncertainties were introduced in order to challenge the proposed method. A more realistic CFD type application is then discussed. It consists of a two dimensional NACA 0012 symmetric profile operating at subsonic flight conditions. It is shown that the proposed reduced order method based on sparse polynomial chaos expansions is able to predict statistical quantities with little loss of information, at a cheaper cost than other state-of-the-art techniques.

ID CONSTRUCTION; APPROXIMATIONS; DISCRETIZATION; PROPAGATION
AB The accurate simulation of wave propagation is a problem of longstanding interest. In this article, the focus is on higher-order accurate finite difference schemes for the wave equation in any number of spatial dimensions. In particular, two-step schemes (which operate over three time levels) are studied. A novel approach to the construction of schemes exhibiting both isotropy and accuracy is presented using modified equation techniques, and allowing for the specification of precise stencils of operation for the scheme, and thus direct control over stencil size and thus operation counts per time step. Both implicit and explicit schemes are presented, as well as parametensed families of such schemes under conditions specifying the order of isotropy and accuracy. Such conditions are framed in terms of a set of coupled constraints which are nonlinear in general, but linear for a fixed Courant number. Depending on the particular choice of stencils, it is often possible to develop schemes for which the traditional Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition is exceeded. A wide variety of families of such schemes is presented in one, two and three spatial dimensions, and accompanied by illustrations of numerical dispersion as well as convergence results confirming higher-order accuracy up to eighth order.

   METHOD
AB A pressure-based algorithm for the simulation of compressible interfacial flows is presented. The algorithm is based on a fully-coupled finite-volume framework for unstructured meshes with collocated variable arrangement, in which the governing conservation laws are discretised in conservative form and solved in a single linear system of equations for velocity, pressure and specific total enthalpy, with the density evaluated by an equation of state. The bulk phases are distinguished using the Volume-of-Fluid (VOF) method and the motion of the fluid interface is captured by a state-of-the-art compressive VOF method. A new interface discretisation method is proposed, derived from an analogy with a contact discontinuity, that performs local changes to the discrete values of density and total enthalpy based on the assumption of thermodynamic equilibrium, and does not require a Riemann solver. This interface discretisation method yields a consistent definition of the fluid properties in the interface region, including a unique definition of the speed of sound and the Ranlane-Hugomot relations, and conserves the acoustic features of the flow, i.e. compression and expansion waves. A variety of representative test cases of gas-gas and gas-liquid flows, ranging from acoustic waves and shock tubes to shock-interface interactions in one-, two- and three-dimensional domains, is used to demonstrate the capabilities and versatility of the presented algorithm in all Mach number regimes. The propagation, reflection and transmission of acoustic waves, shock waves and rarefaction fans in interfacial flows are predicted accurately, even for difficult cases that feature fluids with shock impedance matching, transonic shock tubes or strong shocks in gas-liquid flows, as well as on unstructured meshes.

AB Centroidal Voronoi tessellation (CVT)-based mesh generation is a very effective technique for creating high-quality Voronoi meshes and their dual Delaunay triangulations that often play a crucial role in applications, including ocean and atmospheric simulations using finite volume schemes. In the next generation climate models, the spacing scales change dramatically across the whole sphere and require ultra-high resolution and smooth transitions from coarse to fine grid regions. Thus fast and robust spherical CVT (SCVT) meshing algorithms become highly desirable. In this paper, we first propose a Lloydpreconditioned limited-memory BFGS method for constructing SCVTs that is also applicable to the construction of CVTs of general domains. This method is then parallelized based on overlapping domain decomposition, enabling excellent scalability on distributed systems. Results of several computational experiments show that the new method could incur computational time costs one order of magnitude smaller compared with some existing methods for generating large-scale highly variable-resolution meshes, while also providing significant improvements in mesh quality.

AB In this work, we propose an asymptotic preserving scheme for a nonlinear kinetic reaction-transport equation, in the regime of sharp interface. With a nonlinear reaction term of KPP-type, a phenomenon of front propagation was proven in [9]. This behaviour can be highlighted by considering a suitable hyperbolic limit of the kinetic equation, using a Hopf-Cole transform. It was proven in [6,8,11] that the logarithm of the distribution function then converges to the viscosity solution of a constrained Hamilton-Jacobi equation.
   The hyperbolic scaling and the Hopf-Cole transform make the kinetic equation stiff. Thus, the numerical resolution of the problem is challenging, since the standard numerical methods usually lead to high computational costs in these regimes. Asymptotic Preserving (AP) schemes have typically been introduced to deal with this difficulty, since they are designed to be stable along the transition to the macroscopic regime. The scheme we propose is adapted to the non-linearity of the problem, enjoys a discrete maximum principle, and solves the limit equation in the sense of viscosity. It is based on a dedicated micro-macro decomposition attached to the Hopf-Cole transform. As it is well adapted to the singular limit, our scheme is able to cope with singular behaviours in space (sharp interface), and possibly in velocity (concentration in the velocity distribution). Various numerical tests are proposed to illustrate the properties and the efficiency of our scheme. (C) 2018 The Author. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB We propose a method for efficiently coupling the finite element method with atomistic simulations, while using molecular dynamics or kinetic Monte Carlo techniques. Our method can dynamically build an optimized unstructured mesh that follows the geometry defined by atomistic data. On this mesh, different multiphysics problems can be solved to obtain distributions of physical quantities of interest, which can be fed back to the atomistic system. The simulation flow is optimized to maximize computational efficiency while maintaining good accuracy. This is achieved by providing the modules for a) optimization of the density of the generated mesh according to requirements of a specific geometry and b) efficient extension of the finite element domain without a need to extend the atomistic one. Our method is organized as an open-source C++ code. In the current implementation, an efficient Laplace equation solver for calculating the electric field distribution near a rough atomistic surface demonstrates the capability of the suggested approach.

AB We propose and analyze an iterative high-order hybridized discontinuous Galerkin (iHDG) discretization for linear partial differential equations. We improve our previous work [45] in several directions: 1) the improved iHDG approach converges in a finite number of iterations for the scalar transport equation; 2) it is unconditionally convergent for both the linearized shallow water system and the convection-diffusion equation; 3) it has improved stability and convergence rates; 4) we uncover a relationship between the number of iterations and time stepsize, solution order, meshsize and the equation parameters. This allows us to choose the time stepsize such that the number of iterations is approximately independent of the solution order and the meshsize; and 5) we provide both strong and weak scalings of the improved iHDG approach up to 16,384 cores. A connection between iHDG and time integration methods such as parareal and implicit/explicit methods are discussed. Extensive numerical results for linear (and nonlinear) PDEs are presented to verify the theoretical findings. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper we develop the a posteriori error analysis of an augmented mixed-primal finite element method for the 2D and 3D versions of a stationary flow and transport coupled system, typically encountered in sedimentation-consolidation processes. The governing equations consist in the Brinkman problem with concentration-dependent viscosity, written in terms of Cauchy pseudo-stresses and bulk velocity of the mixture; coupled with a nonlinear advection - nonlinear diffusion equation describing the transport of the solids volume fraction. We derive two efficient and reliable residual-based a posteriori error estimators for a finite element scheme using Raviart-Thomas spaces of order k for the stress approximation, and continuous piecewise polynomials of degree <= k + 1 for both velocity and concentration. For the first estimator we make use of suitable ellipticity and inf-sup conditions together with a Helmholtz decomposition and the local approximation properties of the Clement interpolant and Raviart-Thomas operator to show its reliability, whereas the efficiency follows from inverse inequalities and localisation arguments based on triangle-bubble and edge-bubble functions. Next, we analyse an alternative error estimator, whose reliability can be proved without resorting to Helmholtz decompositions. Finally, we provide some numerical results confirming the reliability and efficiency of the estimators and illustrating the good performance of the associated adaptive algorithm for the augmented mixed-primal finite element method.

AB In this article we solve the inverse reflector problem for a light source emitting a parallel light bundle and a target in the far-field of the reflector by use of a least-squares method. We derive the Monge-Ampere equation, expressing conservation of energy, while assuming an arbitrary coordinate system. We generalize a Cartesian coordinate least-squares method presented earlier by Pnns et al. [13] to arbitrary orthogonal coordinate systems. This generalized least-squares method provides us the freedom to choose a coordinate system suitable for the shape of the light source. This results in significantly increased numerical accuracy. Decrease of errors by factors up to 10(4) is reported. We present the generalized least-squares method and compare its numerical results with the Cartesian version for a disk-shaped light source.

AB In this paper, we generalize the normalized gradient flow method to compute the ground states of Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) with higher order interactions (HOI), which is modeled via the modified Gross-Pitaevskii equation (MGPE). Schemes constructed in naive ways suffer from severe stability problems due to the high restrictions on time steps. To build an efficient and stable scheme, we split the HOI term into two parts with each part treated separately. The part corresponding to a repulsive/positive energy is treated semi-implicitly while the one corresponding to an attractive/negative energy is treated fully explicitly. Based on the splitting, we construct the BEFD-splitting and BESP-splitting schemes. A variety of numerical experiments show that the splitting will improve the stability of the schemes significantly. Besides, we will show that the methods can be applied to multidimensional problems and to the computation of the first excited state as well. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In [1], the authors proposed a charge-conservative numerical framework for simulating electrohydrodynamic two-phase flows where the electric force was discretely treated as the divergence of Maxwell stress tensor because the use of volume-averaged electric force was found to be inaccurate. In this letter, we show that this framework still suffers from inaccuracies, particularly at high permittivity ratios and propose a simple solution that involves reconstruction of electric displacement rather than the electric field. We demonstrate the efficacy of the new remedial approach through simple numerical experiments for different electrical behaviour of the fluids over a range of permittivity ratios.

AB This paper reports the development and convergence analysis in steady-state of an effective and robust implicit finite-volume solver for compressible Euler equations on three-dimensional unstructured grids. A second-order upwind scheme (MUSCL) was employed based on Roe's approximate Flux-Difference Scheme (FDS) by using Venkatrakishnan flux limiters. The construction of the linear system for the implicit scheme was performed by applying the backward Euler on the left-hand side of the conservation equation and Newton-type linearization on the right-hand side. The Jacobian matrix that resulted from the linearization process was computed analytically using Roe flux terms. In this phase, the defect-correction technique was employed allowing effective time-dependent computations by an implicit time-integration scheme. In this approach, the flux integral on the right-hand side is computed based on a high-order of accuracy whilst the left-hand side the Jacobian is performed based on the low-order. The resulting sparse and large system of linear equations is solved by a sequential Gauss-Seidel iterative method. Simulations were performed and the developed implicit defect-correction solver was validated and verified. In addition, convergence analysis comparing the implicit solver and the explicit Runge-Kutta of 5-steps using Implicit Residual Smoothing (IRS) were performed showing the significant speed-up of the implicit solver over the explicit one. Simulations were performed for case studies to demonstrate the robustness of the developed implicit defect-correction solver in solving typical problems of aerodynamic involving transonic condition and shock wave captures for internal and external flows. Finally, the main particularities of the implicit scheme were investigated and discussed considering the simulation results, showing also its capacity to serve as an effective preconditioner (start-up method) to other implicit techniques.

AB Reduced graphene oxide (RGO)-loaded flower-like ZnCo2O4 nanohybrid (ZnCo2O4/RGO) was prepared and then used as counter electrode (CE) in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Scanning electron microscopy showed that the flower-like structure of ZnCo2O4 was made up of a large number of thin nanosheets and that the RGO sheets reunited with ZnCo2O4 together commendably. The results and analysis illustrated that the distinctive ZnCo2O4 structure provided numberous catalytic reaction sites and that the RGO sheets served as a guide way to accelerate the transmission of electrons. Benefited from the synergetic effect of ZnCo2O4 and RGO, the ZnCo2O4/RGO nanohybrid exhibited excellent electrocatalytic performance. Finally, a competitive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.22% was achieved for the DSSCs based on the ZnCo2O4/RGO nanohybrid CE. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A facile, rapid one-pot microwave heating technique in solid state is introduced to prepare crystalline Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) nanoparticles without any post-reaction. The microwave irradiation was operated with a power of 900W for 20 min. Structure and morphology of the product were characterized using XRD, Raman, SEM, EDS, TEM and SAED analyses. The XRD, Raman and EDS analyses showed the formation of a pure kesterite phase of CZTS. SEM and TEM images revealed uniform particulate morphology with an average particle size of 38 nm and a single-phased crystalline SAED pattern. The electrochemical measurements of the as-synthesized product revealed a good nature of energy storage with a specific capacitance of 185 F g(-1) at 5 mV s(-1). Such multi-components materials can offer as an inexpensive and nontoxic candidate for mass production of supercapacitor and energy storage systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The size and distribution of TiB whiskers (TiBw) in TiB reinforced titanium matrix composite (TiB-TMCs)were tailored by the electron beam remelting. A significant refinement of TiBw has been achieved in the remelted region, as well as the grain. Interestingly, the refined TiBw were reconstructed via electron beam remelting, forming the quasi-continuous network (QCN) structure and dispersive structure along the depth direction of the remelted region. A gradient hardness is obtain in the remelted TMCs, and the wear resistance is greatly improved after remelting. This study provides a promising method to tailor the architecture of TiBw in the TiB-TMCs for enhancing the surface performance. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB In this work, we present a simple technique to prevent electromigration damage in printed Ag thin wires. The Ag thin wire can be protected by a silicone rubber layer during current supply. A comparison between protected Ag wires and unprotected Ag wires in the electromigration testing was made. Under same experimental conditions, electromigration induced damage including voids, hillocks and open circuit can be avoided by using the protection layer. It was found that the silicone rubber layer caused a resistance to prevent electromigration damage, the resistance increased with increasing the thickness of protection layer. This technique can provide great potential applications for improving reliability in electronic devices on both rigid and flexible substrate. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The microstructure and mechanical properties of the novel AlSi11CuMn alloy manufactured by selective laser melting were investigated in the as processed state and after heat treatment. A fine eutectic structure formed in the as processed alloy. A duplex size structure formed after solution treatment. The thermal expansion coefficient was 19.1.10 (6) degrees C-1 in the 20-100 degrees C range which is typical for cast Al-Si alloys. Increasing annealing temperature from 190 to 275 degrees C leads to a sharp decrease in the alloy hardness from 136HV to 119HV after 2.5 h. The hardness was significantly reduced from 136HV to 79-82HV after solution treatment at 515 degrees C. The yield stress, ultimate tensile strength and elongation were 288 MPa, 354 MPa and 5.4%, respectively after solution treatment at 515 degrees C and aging at 180 degrees C for 8 h.

AB The present report shows the photo-induced spike generation from the transparent ITO/V2O5/ZnO/ITO device. Particularly, pyroelectric ZnO and hole selective V2O5 are utilized to construct the all oxide-based self-biased and transparent ultra-violet spike generator. It is demonstrated that the magnitude of the spikes depends on the incoming photon intensity. The spike generation from all-oxide-based transparent device will be useful to design advanced see-through neuromorphic devices beyond the energy generation entities. In addition, external electric potential-dependent tunability of the spike generation is presented for high-efficient performances. This self-biased, transparent photodetector could be a replacement of the silicon neurons and resolve the issue of power consumption. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A strain of 10% is applied to 316L stainless steel specimens at strain rates of 7.7 x 10(4) s(-1), 200 s(-1) and 50 s(-1) using vaporizing foil actuator (VFA) technique for the highest strain rate and dynamic plastic deformation (DPD) for the lower strain rates. There is a dramatic increase in hardness with increasing strain rate, rising to over 2.2 GPa at the highest strain rate. While the average twin thickness remained similar across different strain rate regimes, a dense criss cross pattern of twins is formed at the highest strain rate from activation of deformation twinning in non-parallel planes. This shows promise for VFA driven flyers process as a method for surface modification and hardening. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Electrical conduction behavior of ultrathin cerium doped In2O3 (ICO) films fabricated by reactive plasma deposition (RPD) method at low temperature is investigated. It is found that both carrier density and mobility of ICO film are dependent on the film thickness strongly. When the film thickness is increased from 5 nm to 300 nm, carrier density improved gradually from 0.5 x 10(20) cm(-3) to 2.1 x 10(20) cm(-3), while carrier mobility increased from 35.1 cm(2)/Vs to 153.7 cm(2)/Vs and then decreased slightly to 121.5 cm(2)/Vs. The limited carrier mobility is theoretically discussed from analyzing the counterplay between grains boundary scattering-limited and surface scattering-limited mechanism. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Magnetic after-effects in ferrite nanoparticles have been measured with magnetic disaccommodation technique. For higher annealing temperature multidomain formation is detected with low temperature relaxation process similar to single crystal and polycrystalline NiFe2O4. As expected, no room temperature processes are observed due to low vacancy content. On the other hand, logarithmic relaxations are observed at lower annealing temperatures, revealing monodomain character. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Two-dimensional (2D) MoS2 has recently emerged as an efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyst due to its unique atomic layered structure and stability in harsh acidic environment. However, the high electrochemical performance of MoS2 is still limited to edges of its 2D layers. Here, we report the synthesis of highly porous MoS2 films exhibiting a large density of edge sites by using a direct sputter deposition method. Interestingly, the as-deposited MoS2 films resulted into a 3R phase with nano porous structure which is attributed to the lattice relaxation and high energy of sputtered ions. The as-synthesized porous MoS2 nanostructures demonstrate an excellent electrocatalytic performance with a low HER onset potential of similar to 0.2 V, long-term cycling stability, and a low Tafel slope in the range of similar to 80-90 mV/decade at a high cathodic current density.

AB S-doped TiO2 nanofibers are introduced as a novel photoanode in the DSSC. The proposed anode was fabricated by electrospinning of poly(vinyl acetate)/titanium isopropoxide sol-gel followed by calcination at 500 C-circle. Afterward, the obtained TiO2 nanofibers were hydrothermally treated in dimethyl sulfoxide at 180 C-circle for 18 h. SEM, TEM images revealed good morphology, and surface holes-containing nanofibers. XRD analysis emphasized on the unnecessity of excessive calcination temperature because that would convert the anatase TiO2 to the undesirable rutile phase. XPS technique concluded the presence of S atoms with an oxidation state of +6. These atoms are attached to the surface and inside the lattice of the TiO2 nanofibers. As an anode in the DSSC, the treated nanofibers showed very good performance compared to the untreated ones. Typically, 4.27% and 1.54% solar-to-electrical energy conversion was obtained from the DSSC having the treated and untreated TiO2 nanofibers, respectively. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The influence of thickness on the structural parameters, off-stoichiometry and cation disorder in kesterite Cu2ZnSnSe4 films grown by flash deposition for solar cell absorbers is investigated employing X-ray diffraction, energy-dispersive X-ray and Raman spectroscopies. It is shown that the lattice parameters of Cu2ZnSnSe4 changed depending on film thickness: the 100 nm film turned out to be weakly stretched on the molybdenum-coated glass substrates, while, in the thicker films, the compressive deformation is defined. The causes of the changes in film structure are outlined. Raman spectra revealed secondary phases like Cu2SnSe3 detecting reduction of its fraction with an increment in thickness; also, the Sn-Zn antisite defect fraction decreases. Simultaneously, the share of disordered kesterite phase associated with CuZn antisite defects rises with thickness. The obtained results can be useful for optimization of technological growth process. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Tungsten-Copper (W-Cu) composites are promising materials for electrical and thermal applications. However, its fabrication method still remains limited in conventional techniques, such as powder metallurgy, which are not suitable for manufacturing densified complex W-Cu components. In this work, laser 3D printing technology was introduced for fabricating W-20 wt% Cu composites. The effect of processing parameters on the macroscopic features and microstructures of W-Cu composite was investigated. Through optimizing the process parameters, a W-Cu composite with good surface quality and homogeneous microstructure was successfully fabricated under the laser power of 2000W and laser scan speed of 360 mm/min.

The XRD and TEM results show that single-phase Geh with diameters approximately less than 100 nm is obtained successfully by this method. In vitro bioactivity tests that are conducted by immersing the samples in simulated body fluid (SBF) under physiological conditions at different time intervals, confirmed that Geh nanobioceramic has high bioactivity and apatite is grown rapidly on the surface of Geh disc after immersion in SBF. The present study proposes Geh as a promising biomaterial for bone tissue regeneration. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Bioinert ceramic, such as zirconia, provides the mechanical strength required in implants, but its limited bioactivity renders it incapable of osseointegration. Thus, its biomedical application is limited. Graphene and its derivatives possess excellent bioactivity and can enhance osseointegration, hemocompatibility and antibacterial properties. Here, we introduce an innovative technique for functionalizing bioinert ceramic by immobilizing reduced graphene oxide (rGO) onto the surface by tailored self-assembled monolayer (SAM). Three routes have been applied for immobilization: i) spontaneous reaction between -OH groups of zirconia and organic functional groups of rGO, ii) spontaneous reaction between -NH2 functionalized ZrO2 attained by silanization and -COOH groups of rGO and iii) reaction between -NH2 functionalized zirconia and activated -COOH groups of rGO attained by using the catalysts EDC and NHS. The most efficient immobilization was obtained between activated -COOH groups of rGO and -NH2 functionalized zirconia. Thereby, for the first time rGO was successfully coupled to ZrO2 using SAM technique. Through this technique, the properties of rGO and zirconia could be merged to create a versatile biomaterial.

AB Mesoporous MCM-41 was synthesized via the extraction of silica from bamboo leaf ash and used as a support matrix for the immobilization of lipase to hydrolyze rubber seed oil. The effect of extraction parameters on MCM-41 synthesis was evaluated using Central Composite Design (CCD). More than 85% silica recovery from bamboo leaf ash was obtained for an extractant to ash weight ratio - 1.75 (wt/wt), ultra-sonication time -8 h and temperature -80 C-circle). Lipase from porcine pancreas (triacylglycerol ester hydrolase, EC 3.1.1.3) was immobilized on the synthesized MCM-41. Approximately 73% hydrolysis was obtained at an immobilized lipase loading of 100 mg and water content -20v/v % at room temperature (35 C-circle). Less than 15% reduction in percent hydrolysis of rubber seed oil even after 15 cycles of reuse suggested the effectiveness of the reused catalyst. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Porcelain stoneware tiles are materials with excellent technical properties processed by using high temperatures and fast firing cycles that requires high-quality fluxes. However, high cost and exhaustive reserves of traditional used feldspars limits their use. The study of the fluxing potential of granitic rock wastes and basalts and their effect on properties and microstructure of porcelain tiles was carried out. The addition of the basalt in the amount of 7.5 wt% leads to the best densification behavior and nearzero water absorption of the samples. The properties of porcelain tiles with addition of basalt and granitic rock wastes show the possibility of their limit use as fluxes in ceramic tiles industry. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Effect of Si substitution at Al site of CO2MnSi1-xAlx Heusler alloy for composition x = 0.25 on its structural and magnetic properties, prepared by the arc melting method, was studied. The alloy was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photo electron spectroscopy (XPS), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX) and magnetic measurements. Our findings revealed the soft ferromagnetic nature of alloy, crystallizes in the L21 structure of lattice parameter a = 5.671 angstrom. However, the presence of some antisite disorder (B2/A2) destroyed the half metallicity of alloy as computed by full-potential linearized augmented plane wave (FLAPW) method of density functional theory (DFT), indicates the traditional ferromagnetic behavior of CO2MnAl.25Si.75 alloy. Theoretical magnetic moment of CO2MnAl.25Si.75 alloy was found 4: 29 mu(B)/formula unit (f. u.) in contrast to experimentally obtained moment 3: 91 mu(B)/f.u., with good agreements with literature.

AB The influence of ice-crystals growing direction over the organization of cellulose nanofibers as freezecasted foams is reported. This tuning was achieved by changing the metallic (copper) area of the sample molds which altered the freezing-front behavior, causing an oriented foam structure in certain directions. This orientation imparted different microarchitectures to the foams, leading to different pores sizes and wall thicknesses which could be characterized by advanced image techniques based on microtomography. As consequence, mechanical properties, such as compression modulus, have changed. In this study, a statistical approach is used to validate all the results obtained. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB The impact of two temperature levels (50 degrees C and 75 degrees C) and heating times (30 min and 3 h) on the composition of thermovinified musts and wines from Carignan was investigated at the laboratory scale in 2014 and 2015. The heating temperature had a significant impact on the extraction of amino acids and a probable thermal degradation of anthocyanins was noted at 75 degrees C. In 2014, musts from grapes that underwent a heat treatment at 50 degrees C for 3 h had a similar level of phenolic compounds as those treated at 75 degrees C for 30 min. This indicates that the reduction of the heating temperature in some vintages can be compensated for through an extension of the heating period. Several grape-derived molecules were impacted by the rise in temperature and wines made from grapes treated at 50 degrees C in most cases contained larger concentrations of geraniol, beta-citronellol, beta-damascenone and 3-mercaptohe xanol.

ID RESISTANT STARCH CONTENT; COOKED RICE; COOKING; IMPACT
AB The impact of parboiling on starch digestibility of cooked rice was examined through an in vitro digestion model. Results indicated that the equilibrium starch hydrolysis of polished rice was the highest (86.55%), followed by that of parboiled-polished (83.94%), brown (80.59%) and parboiled rice (76.95%). X-ray diffraction analysis indicated that A-type crystals were predominant in brown rice and polished rice, while A-, B- and V-type crystalline structures coexisted in parboiled rice and parboiled-polished rice. Thin and compact layers were observed on the surfaces of parboiled rice and were considered to be physical barriers that reduce the starch digestibility. The study demonstrates that parboiling could change the crystallinity and reduce the starch digestion of rice significantly.

AB A very high pullulan producing yeast-like fungus, Aureobasidium melanogenum TN1-2 isolated from a natural honey was found to be able to produce 97.0 g/L of pullulan from 140.0 g/L sucrose at a flask level while it could yield 114.0 g/L of pullulan within 134 h during a 10-liter fermentation, the yield was 0.81 g/g and the productivity was 0.86 g/L/h. The high ability to biosynthesize pullulan by this yeast-like fungal strain TN1-2 was related to high glucosyltransferase activity, high phosphofructo-2-kinase activity, high content of its cellular glycerol and low glucose repressor. The Mw of the produced pullulan was 1.42 x 10(5) g/mol. The low Mw may be due to the high a-amylase, glucoamylase and isopullulanase activities. The intracellular level of trehalose had no influence on high pullulan production by the yeast-like fungal strain TN1-2.

AB A sensitive GC-MS method is reported for the determination of twelve polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in baby food. The sample preparation involves QuEChERS extraction combined with low-density solvent dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (LDS-DLLME) and ultra-low temperature (-80 degrees C). Plackett-Burman screening design was employed to identify the main sample preparation variables that affect the extraction efficiency, such as the volume of toluene used in LDS-DLLME. The suitability of proposed method was verified by analytical selectivity, linearity in solvent and matrix-matched calibration curves and adequate recoveries (72-112%) and precision (RSD values <= 11%), under repeatability and within-laboratory reproducibility conditions. High analytical sensitivity was achieved for the monitoring of PAHs at the strict limit of 1 mu g kg(-1) fixed by the European Commission for baby foods. The validated method was applied to thirty-two commercial baby food samples, and the investigated PAHs were not detected in any sample.

Cymbopogon citratus (C. citratus; main compound 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid) and Aloysia citrodora (A. citrodora; prevalence of verbascoside) reserve lots revealed higher phenolic compounds concentration than the respective standard lots. Thymusxcitriodorus (T. citriodorus; main compound rosmarinic acid) standard lot presented higher amounts of phenolic acids than the reserve lot, nonetheless, total flavonoids and phenolic compounds were not significantly different. The differences between both lots antioxidant activity were more noticeable in C. citratus, with the reserve lot presenting the highest activity. This study provides evidence of the differences between these plants chemical composition and bioactivity depending on the harvesting conditions.

AB Increased preference to herbal drinks has led to global interest in the use and production of different plant species for the preparation of various drink formulations. Medicinal properties derived from bioactive compounds remain the main driver of choice for herbal teas. This study determined the chemical variation in honeybush, rooibos, special and bush tea, profiled compounds responsible for such differences and compared their peak areas. Nuclear magnetic resonance and high resolution liquid chromatography- mass spectrometry were used to determine compound variation and profiling. Principal component analysis and partial-least square multivariate statistical analysis showed distinct differences (P < 0.05) between the different types of herbal teas. Detected compounds included flavonoids, phenolics, lignans, megastigmane glycoside, most of which possess health benefits. The findings showed that South African herbal teas could play a vital role as health promoting drinks, and that bush tea and special tea are phytochemically comparable with other commercialized herbal teas.

AB The oxidation of oaked Chardonnay wine during long-term storage was studied by headspace solid-phase microextraction coupled to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC/MS) and proton (H-1) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Three distinct groups of wine were defined based on the browning index: control, least oxidized (OX1) and most oxidized (OX2). HS-SPME-GC/MS and H-1 NMR spectroscopy enabled the profiling of a total of 155 compounds in all wine samples including aldehydes, ketones, esters, polyphenols, among other classes. Acetaldehyde, 3-methylbutanal, 2-phenylacetaldehyde, methional, 3-penten-2-one, beta-damascenone and four unknown carbonyl compounds showed the highest percentage of variation with oxidation. Novel oxidation markers found in this work include pentanal, 3-methyl-2-butanone, 3-penten-2-one, 2-methyltetrahydrofuran-3-one, beta-damascenone, ethyl 2-methylbutanoate and vinyl decanoate. In addition, several correlations between polyphenols, aroma compounds and absorbance at 420 nm (A(420)) were observed, suggesting the occurrence of chemical reactions with a possible impact in wine browning.

AB The seeds of Bixa orellana L. is widely used in food industry as a natural colorant. A major technological challenge for its utilization on aqueous food products is the low water solubility. Therefore, the present study aimed to obtain aqueous nanodispersions using this natural raw material by using a simple organic solvent-free and low energy method. Bixin and geranylgeraniol were found on the extract. The nanodispersions were prepared by addition of water on a mixture of extract and surfactant (s). The effect of the surfactants and dilution on the nanodispersions were also evaluated. Best results were achieved using polysorbate 80/sorbitan monooleate (HLB 13) (diluted in water, 1:10). The results shows the potential of this ecofriendly approach, in contrast to common methods that make use of potentially toxic organic solvents and high input of energy, which elevate the costs for further industrialization.

AB In this investigation, we aimed to study, for the first time, the phenolic composition of Pistacia lentiscus seed oils from different growing areas. Extraction of the phenolic fraction from oils was done by methanol/water. Phenolic profiles were determined using chromatographic analysis by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC-DAD/MSD) and its quantification was done using an internal standard which is unidentified in the studied oil (syringic acid). Forty phenolic compounds were quantified and only eighteen of them were identified. The eight studied oils showed different phenolic profiles. The total phenols amount varied from 538.03 mg/kg oil in Jbel Masour oils to 4260.57 mg/kg oil in oils from Kef Erraai. The highest amount of secoiridoids was reached by Bouchoucha oil containing 366.71 mg/kg oil of Oleuropein aglycon. Oils from Kef Erraai locality contained the highest concentrations in flavonols (377.44 mg/kg oil) and in phenolic acids (2762.67 mg/kg oil).

AB Cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of sodium acetate (SA), sodium diacetate (SDA), and potassium sorbate (PS) was tested on Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVEC). Cytotoxicity was investigated by MTT assay and flow cytometry analysis, while genotoxicity was evaluated using DNA fragmentation and DAPI staining assays. The growth of treated HUVECs with various concentrations of SA, SDA and PS decreased in a dose-and time-dependent manner. The IC50 of 487.71, 485.82 and 659.96 mu M after 24 h and IC50 of 232.05, 190.19 and 123.95 mu M after 48 h of treatment were attained for SA, SDA and PS, respectively. Flow cytometry analysis showed that early and late apoptosis percentage in treated cells was not considerable. Also neither considerable DNA fragmentation nor DNA smear was observed using DAPI staining and DNA ladder assays. Overall, it can be concluded that the aforementioned food additives can be used as safe additives at low concentration in food industry.

AB Ginger is a commonly used spice around the world. Its bioactive compounds contain hydrophobic gingerols and hydrophilic polysaccharides. Huge physiochemical differences between these compounds and the thermal instability of gingerols impede fast and effective extraction of them using conventional methods. In this research, ionic liquid-based ultrasonic-assisted extraction (ILUAE) was applied to simultaneously extract gingerols and polysaccharides from ginger. Parameters influencing the recovery of gingerols were ionic liquid type, ionic liquid concentration, solid/liquid ratio, ultrasonic power, extraction temperature and extraction time. Compared with traditional methods, LUAE significantly increased the yield of total gingerols and shortened the extraction time. Meanwhile, ginger polysaccharides recovery reached up to 92.82% with ILUAE. Our results indicated that ILUAE has a remarkable capacity to extract gingerols and ginger polysaccharides in one step. Therefore, ILUAE represents a promising technology for simultaneous extraction of hydrophilic and hydrophobic bioactive compounds from plant materials.

AB The current study aims to evaluate in commercial hybrids the influence of harvest period about physicochemical and biochemical characterization of different genotypes at the unripe fruit stages. Therefore, 16 hybrids were assessed within 4 harvest times, making up to 64 treatments. Physicochemical and biochemical characterization of sweet pepper at unripe fruit stages were influenced by harvest times and genotypes. Results indicated a decrease in pigment contents in all hybrids when harvested at 130 days after sowing (DAS). Additionally, Eppo, Magali, Dahra and Anabell decreased in ascorbic acid contents at 175 DAS; while Melina, Anabell, Don Santino, Balico and Lucigno increased in reducing sugar contents at same harvest time.

AB Glycosylated whey peptides (WPP-Gal A and WPP-Gal B) were formed from two pathways. WPP-Gal A showed higher browning intensity and fluorescence intensity than WPP-Gal B. Loss of amino groups and reducing sugar was heavier for WPP-Gal A than WPP-Gal B. Size exclusion chromatography revealed that WPP-Gal A and B had similar curves, but the molecular weight distribution of WPP-Gal B was more extensive than that of WPP-Gal A. Particle size was larger for WPP-Gal B than WPP-Gal A. Furthermore, WPP-Gal A showed greater antioxidant activity than WPP-Gal B. FT-IR analysis indicated that vibrations of several chemical bonds in amide I, II and III bands of WPP-Gal A were more obvious than those of WPP-Gal B. WPP-Gal A showed greater Caco-2 cell proliferation than WPP-Gal B. Therefore, WPP-Gal A showed more significant structural and characteristic changes, higher antioxidant activity and better proliferative activity than WPP-Gal B.

AB Arthrospira platensis and Arthrospira maxima are a type of blue-green microalga used as a dietary supplement (Spirulina). A low time-consuming ultrasound-assisted digestion (UAD) of Spirulina supplements for multielemental determination by microwave induced plasma atomic emission spectrometry (MPAES) was performed. Several parameters such as acid concentration (AC), thermostated water bath (TWB), digestion time (DT) and UAD - probe or bath - affecting the digestion process were evaluated through a full factorial design. Under the optimal conditions -100 degrees C for TWB, 5% for AC and 10 min for DT- and selecting the bath as the proper UAD system, the concentrations of 15 analytes (Al, Ba, Ca, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, P, V, Zn) were reported. The values are in accordance with the recommendation established by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) excepting for Cd. The knowledge of Spirulina multielemental composition contributes to an outstanding nutritional and toxicological report for human health.

AB The unplanned inclusion of antinutrients in fish food affects many biological processes, such as digestibility of amino acids and diet conversion, resulting in undesirable effects on body growth. Thus, the objective of this research was to propose the use of immobilized fish proteases in the detection of protease inhibitors, one of the most important antinutrients. In order to evaluate the detection of antinutritional factors through the immobilized trypsin, the enzyme was incubated with eight diets developed for commercial fish, and residual activity was measured. Comparatively, the tilapia trypsin showed an inhibition of antinutrients (protease inhibitors), present in the eight studied diets, up to 48% greater than the porcine trypsin immobilized in magnetic chitosan. Thus, it is possible to suggest the use of immobilized derivatives containing specific proteases of the target organism in the detection of antinutritional factors that reduce animal's digestive capacity and negatively influence their growth during husbandry.

AB In this study cold low pressure radiofrequency oxygen plasma was used for the first time to inactivate toxicogenic fungi proliferation on saffron. Varieties of plasma produced reactive oxygen species which were investigated by optical emission spectroscopy. The data were indicative of the absence of UV radiation. Effects of plasma treatment on antioxidant activity, metabolic content, colour, odour and flavour parameters and physical impact on saffron were investigated. A range of plasma powers and exposure times were assayed in suppression of fungal growth. Amongst which power of 60W for 15 min was used to eradicate Aspergillus and other microorganisms. The ferric reducing antioxidant power was changed from 1778.21 to 1674.25 mM/g dry weight following plasma treatment. Moreover, crocin ester, picrocrocin and safranal metabolites reduced insignificantly. Additionally, plasma had no significant impact on colour, odour and flavour of saffron.

AB Insoluble dietary fiber (DF) extracted from carrot pomace was modified by complex enzyme method, ultrafine comminution and high hydrostatic pressure and their structural, physicochemical, and functional properties were evaluated. Results showed that complex enzyme method increased the content of soluble DF to 15.07%, and the cholesterol adsorption capacity peaked; ultrafine comminution greatly improved the total antioxidant activities, DPPH radical scavenging capacity and antioxidant abilities in linoleic acid system of DF; high hydrostatic pressure led to a significant increase in capacities of water retention (7.14 g/g, 600 MPa), water swelling (10.02 mL/g, 500 MPa), oil retention (2.35 g/g, 500 MPa), cation exchange (2.29 mmol/g, 600 MPa), and glucose adsorption (2.634 mmol/g, 400 MPa). Furthermore, SEM showed that surface structures of all modified DF were loose. Overall, three kinds of modification methods have shown their respective advantages. Modified DF from carrot pomace can be applied as a functional ingredient in diverse food products.

AB Mixed fermentations with Starmerella bacillaris and Saccharomyces cerevisiae affect the chemical composition of wines, by modulating various metabolites of oenological interest. The current study was carried out to elucidate the effect of sequential inoculation of the above mentioned species on the production of white wines, especially on the chemical and aromatic characteristics of Chardonnay, Muscat, Riesling and Sauvignon blanc wines. Titratable acidity and glycerol content exhibited evident differences among the wines after fermentation. For volatile compounds, mixed fermentations led to a reduction of the total esters, including ethyl acetate, which is a compound responsible for wine deterioration. However, Sauvignon blanc wines fermented by mixed cultures contained significantly higher levels of esters and thiols, both associated with positive sensory attributes. These findings suggest that sequential inoculations possess great potential in affecting and modulating the chemical and aromatic profile of white wines, especially those produced from Sauvignon blanc grapes.

AB The objective of this study was to evaluate the quality of avocado oil whose pulp was processed through different drying and oil extraction methods. The physicochemical characteristics of avocados cv. Breda were determined after drying the pulp in an oven under ventilation (40 degrees C and 60 degrees C) and vacuum oven (60 degrees C), followed by the oil extracted by mechanical pressing or the Soxhlet method. From the approximately 72% pulp found in the avocado fruit, the 16% fraction is lipids. The quality indices evaluated in avocado oil showed better results when the pulp was dried at 60 degrees C under vacuum and oil extraction was done by the Soxhlet method with petroleum ether, whereas the bioactive compounds were better preserved when the avocado pulp was dried at 60 degrees C under ventilation and mechanical pressing was used for the oil extraction. Among the fatty acids found, oleic acid was the main.

AB Heat stress has an adverse effect on the quality and quantity of agriculturally important crops, especially wheat. The tolerance mechanism has not been explored much in wheat and very few genes/TFs responsive to heat stress is available on public domain. Here, we identified, cloned and characterized a putative TaHSFA6e TF gene of 1.3 kb from wheat cv. HD2985. We observed an ORF of 368 aa with Hsf DNA binding signature domain in the amino acid sequence. Single copy number of TaHSFA6e was observed integrated in the genome of wheat. Expression analysis of TaHSFA6e under differential HS showed maximum transcripts in wheat cv. Halna (thermotolerant) in response to 38 degrees C for 2 h during pollination and grain-filling stages, as compared to PBW343, HD2329 and HD2985. Putative target genes of TaHSFA6e (HSP17, HSP70 and HSP90) showed upregulation in response to differential HS (30 & 38 degrees C, 2 h) during pollination and grain-filling stages. Small HSP17 was observed most triggered in Halna under HS. We observed increase in the catalase, guaiacol peroxidase, total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and decrease in the lipid peroxidation in thermotolerant cvs. (Halna, HD2985), as compared to thermosusceptible (PBW343, HD2329) under differential HS. Multiple stresses (heat - 38 degrees C, 2 h, and drought - 100 mL of 20% polyethylene Glycol 6000) during seedling stage of wheat showed positive correlation between the expression of TaHSFA6e, putative targets (HSP70, HSP90, HSP17) and TAC. Halna (thermotolerant) performed better, as compared to other contrasting cvs. TaHSFA6e TF can be used as promising candidate gene for manipulating the heat stress-tolerance network.

AB Effective and low-cost inducer is a prerequisite for efficiency improvement in cellulase production by Trichoderma reesei. In this study, spores of Aspergillus niger enriched with cellobiase were embedded in Ca-alginate microcapsules, attaining a sustained cellobiase-release system (named CRMA) which was then used to catalyze the conversion of glucose into glucose-sophorose sugar mixture via transglycosylation. Further, the process and optimal parameters of transglycosylation reaction were studied in a 5 L reactor and the sophorose concentration reached 70.55 g/L at 50 degrees C, pH 4.0 with CRMA loading of 200 mL after 72 h of reaction. The obtained sugar mixture was subsequently used as both carbon source and inducer in cellulase production by Trichoderma reesei under fed-batch process. The filter paper activity (FPA) reached 90.28 IU/mL at 144 h fermentation time, 1.85-fold higher than that induced by lactose. These results indicate that the newly established strategy for soluble inducer synthesis has the potential for efficiency improvement and cost reduction in cellulase production.

AB Hermetia illucens is a voracious insect scavenger, decomposing food waste efficiently. To survey novel hydrolytic enzymes, we constructed a fosmid metagenome library using unculturable intestinal microorganisms from H. illucens in our previous study (Lee et al., 2014). Functional screening of the library on carboxymethyl cellulose plates identified a fosmid clone the product of which displayed hydrolytic activity. Sequence analysis of the fosmid revealed a novel alpha-galactosidase gene, Agas2. The Agas2 gene is composed of 2,007 base pairs encoding 668 amino acids with a deduced 25 amino acid N-terminal signal peptide sequence. The conceptual translation and domain analysis of Agas2 showed the highest sequence identity (84%) with the putative alpha-galactosidase of Dysgonomonas sp. HGC4, exhibiting well-conserved domain homology with glycosyl hydrolase family 97. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that Agas2 may be a currently uncharacterized alpha-galactosidase. The recombinant protein, rAgas2, was successfully expressed in E. coli. rAgas2 showed the highest activity at 40 degrees C and pH 7.0. It displayed great pH stability within a pH range of 5-11 for 15 h at 4 degrees C. rAgas2 was highly stable under stringent conditions, including polar organic solvents, non-ionic detergents, salt, and proteases. rAgas2 hydrolyzed alpha-D-galactose substrates, showing the maximum enzymatic activity toward p-nitrophenyl alpha-D-galactopyranoside (specific activity 128.37 U/mg). However, rAgas2 did not hydrolyze substrates linked with beta-glucose moieties. Overall, Agas2 may be an attractive candidate for the degradation of alpha-galactose family oligosaccharides in high-salt, protease-rich and high-organic-solvent processes.

AB Phthalic acid esters (PAEs) are a family of recalcitrant pollutants mainly used as plasticizer. The strain Gordonia sp. YC-JH1, isolated from petroleum-contaminated soil, is capable of efficiently degrading a wide range of PAEs. In order to pertinently investigate the genetic mechanism of PAEs catabolism by strain YC-JH1, its complete genome sequencing has been performed by SMRT sequencing technology. The genome comprises a circular chromosome and a plasmid with a size of 4,101,557 bp and 91,767 bp respectively. Based on the genome sequence, 3563 protein-coding genes are predicted, of which the genes responsible for PAEs degradation are identified, including the two genes of PAEs hydrolase and the gene clusters for phthalic acid and protocatechuic acid degradation. The genome information provides genomic basis of PAEs degradation to allow the complete metabolism of PAEs. The wide substrate spectrum and its genetic basis of this strain should expand its application potential for environments bioremediation, provide novel gene resources involved in PAEs degradation for biotechnology and gene engineering, and contribute to shed light on the mechanism of PAEs metabolism.

AB New emerging technologies delivering benefits in terms of process robustness and economy are an inevitable prerequisite for monoclonal antibody purification processes intensification. Caprylic acid was proven as an effective precipitating agent enabling efficient precipitaton of product-and process-related impurities while leaving the antibody in solution. This purification step at mild acidic pH was therefore introduced in generic antibody platform approaches after Protein A capture and evaluated for its impact regarding process robustness and antibody stability. Comparison of 13 different monoclonal antibodies showed significant differences in antibody recovery between 65-95% during caprylic acid-induced impurity precipitation. Among six compared physicochemical properties, isoelectric point of the antibody domains was figured out to correlate with yield. Antibodies with mild acidic pI of the light chain were significantly susceptible to caprylic acid-induced precipitation resulting in lower yields. Virus clearance studies revealed that caprylic acid provided complete virus inactivation of an enveloped virus. Multiple process relevant factors such as pH range, caprylic acid concentration and antibody stability were investigated in this study to enable an intensified purification process including caprylic acid precipitation for HCP removal of up to 2 log(10) reduction values at mAb yields > 90% while also contributing to the virus safety of the process.

AB The pharmaceutical production of recombinant proteins, such as monoclonal antibodies, is rather complex and requires proper development work. Accordingly, it is essential to develop appropriate scale-down models, which can mimic the corresponding production scale. In this work, we investigated the impact of the bioreactor scale on intracellular micro-heterogeneities of a CHO cell line producing monoclonal antibodies in fed-batch mode, using a 10 mL micro-bioreactor (ambr (TM)) scale-down model and the corresponding 300 L pilot-scale bioreactor. For each scale, we measured the time evolution of the proteome, which enabled us to compare the impact of the bioreactor scale on the intracellular processes. Nearly absolute accordance between the scales was verified by data mining methods, such as hierarchical clustering and in-detail analysis on a single protein base. The time response of principal enzymes related to N-glycosylation was discussed, emphasizing major dissimilarities between the glycan fractions adorning the heavy chain and the corresponding protein abundance. The enzyme expression displayed mainly a constant profile, whereas the resulting glycan pattern changed over time. It is concluded that the enzymatic activity is influenced by the changing environmental conditions present in the fed-batch processes leading to the observed time-dependent variation.

AB beta-lactams are one of the most common antimicrobials used to treat bacterial infections. However, bacterial resistance has compromised their efficacy, mainly due to the beta-lactamase enzyme production. To overcome this resistance, beta-lactamase inhibitors can be used in association with these antimicrobials. Herein, we analyzed the structural characteristics of beta-lactamases and their interactions with classical inhibitors, such as clavulanic acid (CA), sulbactam (SB) and tazobactam (TZ) to gain insights into resistance. The homology models of five class A beta-lactamases, namely CARB-3, IMI-1, SFO-1, SHV-5 and TEM-10, were constructed and validated and revealed an overall 3D structural conservation, but with significant differences in the electrostatic potential maps, especially at important regions in the catalytic site. Molecular dockings of CA, SB and TZ with these enzymes revealed a covalent bond with the S70 in all complexes, except Carb-3 which is in agreement with experimental data reported so far. This is likely related to the less voluminous active site of Carb-3 model. Although few specific contacts were observed in the beta-lactamase-inhibitor complexes, all compounds interacted with the residues in positions 73, 130, 132, 236 and 237. Therefore, this study provides new perspectives for the design of innovative compounds with broad-spectrum inhibitory profiles against beta-lactamases.

AB Transcriptome and metabolism analysis were performed to evaluate the scale-down of a CHO cell fed-batch process from a 10 L bioreactor to an ambr 15 (R) (ambr) system. Two different agitation scale-down principles were applied, resulting in two different agitation rates in the ambr system: 1300 RPM based on the agitator tip speed, and 800 rpm based on the volumetric power input (P/V). Culture performance including cell growth, product titer, glycosylation, and specific consumption/production rates of metabolites was the same for both agitation rates in the ambr and was comparable to that of the 10 L system. The initial variation in gene expression between the inocula for the ambr and 10 L system was no longer present after three days of culture, indicating comparable culture conditions in both systems. Based on principal component analysis, changes in gene expression over time were similar between both scales with less than 6% variation. 2455 genes were uniquely regulated in the ambr system compared to 1604 genes in the 10 L system. Functional analysis of these genes did not reveal their relations with scale or cellular function. This study further strengthens that the ambr system gives representative culture performance for the 10 L bench-scale bioreactor.

AB Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) has infected as many as 10 million people worldwide. While 90% are asymptomatic, 5% develop severe diseases including adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoka (ATLL) and HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). No vaccine against HTLV-1 exists, and screening programs are not universal. However, patients with chronic HTLV-1 infection have high frequencies of HTLV-1-activated CD8+ T cells, and the two main HLA alleles (A2, A24) are present in 88% of infected individuals. We thus utilized an immunoproteomics approach to characterize MHC-I restricted epitopes presented by HLA-A2+, A24+ MT-2 and SLB-1 cell lines. Unlike traditional motif prediction algorithms, this approach identifies epitopes associated with cytotoxic T-cell responses in their naturally processed forms, minimizing differences in antigen processing and protein expression levels. Out of nine identified peptides, we confirmed six novel MHC-I restricted epitopes that were capable of binding HLA-A2 and HLA-A24 alleles and used in vitro and in vivo methods to generate CD8+ T cells specific for each of these peptides. MagPix MILLIPLEX data showed that in vitro generated epitope-specific CD8+ T cells secreted IFN-gamma, granzyme B, MIP-1 alpha, TNF-alpha, perforin and IL-10 when cultured in the presence of MT-2 cell line. Degranulation assay confirmed cytotoxic response through surface expression of CD107 on CD8+ T cells when cultured with MT-2 cells. A CD8+ T-cell killing assay indicated significant antiviral activity of CD8+ T cells specific against all identified peptides. In vivo generated CD8+ T cells similarly demonstrated immunogenicity on ELISpot, CD107 degranulation assay, and MagPix MILLIPLEX analysis. These epitopes are thus candidates for a therapeutic peptide-based vaccine against HTLV-1, and our results provide preclinical data for the advancement of such a vaccine. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Interstitial lung diseases (ILD) are severe respiratory diseases, and ILD patients are treated with corticosteroid and immunosuppressive agents. However, it is unclear whether these medications influence the response of pneumococcal vaccine.
   Objectives: We examined the immunogenicity of pneumococcal vaccines (PPSV23 and PCV13) in ILD patients undergoing immunosuppressive treatment.
   Methods: ILD patients who were regularly followed at the outpatient clinic were enrolled. Sera were collected before and 4-8 weeks after vaccination. Serotype-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) concentrations against pneumococcal serotype 19F were measured by ELISA.
   Results: IgG concentrations to serotype 19F were increased in all groups in response to the vaccine. Both PCV13 and PPSV23 induced IgG concentrations in patients immunized for the first time. Response rates for the ILD group were comparable with those for the ILD group undergoing corticosteroid therapy. Only idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients undergoing immunosuppressive therapy had a significantly lower response. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Oral fowl typhoid (FT) vaccine is necessary for improved flock vaccinations and economic growth. This study was undertaken to evaluate the immune responses of birds given oral fowl typhoid vaccine coated with chitosanialginate microparticles and comparing it with the conventional subcutaneous route of administration. Preliminary studies were done to evaluate the particle size, encapsulation efficiency and agglutination. Sixty day-old chicks were divided into three groups of twenty birds each. This comprised a negative control group NEG 451 (non-vaccinated and non-challenged used as control for cytokine quantification), SC 634 (live 9R vaccine by the injection route) and OCV 567 (live 9R vaccine coated with chitosan/alginate microparticles). Vaccination was done at 10 weeks and 14 weeks of age followed by challenge at 16 weeks of age. IgG was measured using ELISA. mRNA fold expression of IFN-gamma in spleen was calculated using qRT-PCR. Particle sizes ranged between 0.55 mu m and 10 fan. Encapsulation efficiency was above 60%. ELISA showed E-values of 0.10 +/- 0.14, 0.07 +/- 0.01 and 0.02 +/- 0.01 for OCV 567, SC 634 and NEG 451 respectively after primary vaccination. Also E-values were 0.25 +/- 0.16, 0.19 +/- 0.04 and 0.0008 +/- 0.005 for SC 634, OCV 567 and NEG451 respectively after boost vaccination. The expression of IFN-gamma in spleen using 2(-Delta Delta) (CT) calculation was upregulated with values of 1.97 and 0.75 for OCV 567 and SC 634 respectively. After challenge with the 85-kb virulence plasmid SG9, there was 100% protection of the birds in both OCV 567 and SC 634 groups with no mortality. In conclusion, there was no significant difference at p < 0.05 of the means +/- SD in immune responses between the oral fowl typhoid vaccine coated with chitosanialginate microparticles and the subcutaneous route of administration. However, it is noteworthy to mention that the protective efficacy of the oral route is due to the chitosan/alginate biopolymers which coated the vaccine preventing destruction in the gastrointestinal tract.

AB Vaccine policy, decision processes and outcomes vary widely across Europe. The objective was to map these factors across 16 European countries by assessing (A) national vaccination strategy and implementation, (B) attributes of healthcare vaccination systems, and (C) outcomes of universal mass vaccination (UMV) as a measure of how successful the vaccination policy is.
   A. Eleven countries use standardised assessment frameworks to inform vaccine recommendations. Only Sweden horizon scans new technologies, uses standard assessments, systematic literature and health economic reviews, and publishes its decision rationale. Time from European marketing authorisation to UMV implementation varies despite these standard frameworks. Paediatric UMV recommendations (generally government-funded) are relatively comparable, however only influenza vaccine is widely recommended for adults.
   B. Fourteen countries aim to report annually on national vaccine coverage rates (VCRs), as well as have target VCRs per vaccine across different age groups. Ten countries use either electronic immunisation records or a centralised registry for childhood vaccinations, and seven for other age group vaccinations.
   C. National VCRs for infant (primary diphtheria tetanus pertussis (DTP)), adolescent (human papillomavirus (HPV)) and older adult (seasonal influenza) UMV programmes found ranges of: 89.1% to 98.2% for DTP-containing vaccines, 5% to 85.9% for HPV vaccination, and 4.3% to 71.6% for influenza vaccine. Regarding reported disease incidence, a wide range was found across countries for measles, mumps and rubella (in children), and hepatitis B and invasive pneumococcal disease (in all ages).
   These findings reflect an individual approach to vaccination by country. High VCRs can be achieved, particularly for paediatric vaccinations, despite different approaches, targets and reporting systems; these are not replicated in vaccines for other age groups in the same country. Additional measures to improve VCRs across all age groups are needed and could benefit from greater harmonisation in target setting, vaccination data collection and sharing across EU countries.

AB Background: While the 2015-2016 influenza season in the northern hemisphere was dominated by A (H1N1)pdm09 and beta/Victoria viruses, in Beijing, China, there was also significant circulation of influenza A(H3N2) virus. In this report we estimate vaccine effectiveness (VE) against influenza A(H3N2) and other circulating viruses, and describe further characteristics of the 2015-2016 influenza season in Beijing.
   Methods: We estimated VE of the 2015-2016 trivalent inactivated vaccine (TIV) against laboratory confirmed influenza virus infection using the test-negative study design. The effect of prior vaccination on current VE was also examined.
   Results: Of 11,000 eligible patients included in the study, 2969 (27.0%) were influenza positive. Vaccination coverage was 4.2% in both cases and controls. Adjusted VE against all influenza was 8% (95% CI: -16% to 27%): 18% (95% CI: -38% to 52%) for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, 54% (95% CI: 16% to 74%) for influenza A(H3N2), and -8% (95% CI: -40% to 18%) for influenza B/Victoria. The overall VE for receipt of 2015-2016 vaccination only, 2014-2015 vaccination only, and vaccinations in both seasons was -15% (95% CI: -63% to 19%), -25% (95% CI: -78% to 13%), and 18% (95% CI: -11% to 40%), respectively.
   Conclusions: Overall the 2015-2016 TIV was protective against influenza infection in Beijing, with higher VE against the A(H3N2) viruses compared to A(H1N1)pdm09 and B viruses. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Outbreaks of viral nervous necrosis (VNN) in Asian sea bass (Lates calcarifer) at the larval stages via vertical transmission of nervous necrosis virus (NNV) from asymptomatic broodfish remain as a major deterrent during seed production. A five-year study was conducted to produce NNV-specific-free sea bass broodfish reared in land-based tanks through an annual immunization regimen with the formalin-inactivated NNV. We primarily immunized (intraperitoneal injection) sea bass juveniles (5 g) and monitored the neutralizing antibody (Nab) titers in the sera of these fish at scheduled intervals post-immunization. Nab titers in the sera of immunized fish peaked at Month 2 (titer: 1:4480 +/- 1185) but thereafter gradually declined and significantly dropped (1:260 +/- 83) at Month 12 post-primary immunization. Booster immunization of these fish at Month 12 post-immunization led to abrupt increases in Nab titers in booster immunized (B-Im) fish at Month 1 (1:12800 6704) but thereafter declined and dropped at Month 12 (1:480 +/- 165) post-booster immunization. The annual booster injections with the inactivated vaccine or L-15 (Unimmunized [U-Im]) were consecutively conducted for 4 years until the fish became sexually mature. Mature fish from both groups were successively induced to spawn twice (1-month interval) via intramuscular injection with luteinizing hormone releasing hormone analogue (LHRH-a; 100 mu g/kg BW). NNV was not detected by RT-PCR in oocytes and milts, and spawned eggs of B-Im fish. In contrast, oocytes and milts, and spawned eggs of U-Im fish were NNV positive. Spawned eggs of B-Im broodfish exhibited Nab titers ranging from 1:192 34 to 1:240 while such was not detected (<1:40) in eggs of U-Im fish. Taken together, current data clearly demonstrate that annual immunization regimen with inactivated NNV vaccine is a pragmatic approach for sustaining immunocompetent sea bass broodfish reared in land-based tanks and circumvent the risk of vertical transmission of NNV from asymptomatic broodfish to their offspring under stress of repetitive spawning.

AB Regulated delayed attenuation is a well-studied strategy for retaining the immunogenicity of Salmonella vectored vaccines. In this study, this strategy was used to optimize two previously constructed recombinant Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium vaccines expressing S. Choleraesuis O-polysaccharides (OPS). The novel vaccine strains SLT31 (Delta asd Delta rmlB-rfbP Delta P-crp::T araC P-BAD) and SLT33 (Delta asd Delta rfbP Delta pagL::T araC P-BAD rfbP Delta P-crp::T araC P-BAD) were constructed by replacement of the native crp promoter with the arabinose-dependent araC P-BAD promoter. As controls, two vaccine strains with direct crp mutations were also constructed, namely, SLT30 (Delta asd Delta rmlB-rfbP Delta crp) and SLT32 (Delta asd Delta rfbP Delta pagL::T araC P-BAD rfbP Delta crp). Then, the ability to deliver the heterologous S. Choleraesuis OPS on the Asd(+) plasmid pCZ1 to the mouse immune system was evaluated in the strains with or without regulated delayed attenuation. The SLT30 (pCZ1) and SLT31 (pCZ1) strains expressed only the heterologous OPS, while the SLT32 (pCZ1) and SLT33 (pCZ1) strains co-expressed the homologous and heterologous OPS. The strain SLT31 (pCZ1) or SLT33 (pCZ1), which exhibited regulated delayed attenuation, colonized mouse tissues significantly better and stimulated stronger antibody responses against S. Choleraesuis LPS post immunization than the SLT30 (pCZ1) or SLT32 (pCZ1) strain. Immunization with SLT31 (pCZ1) or SLT33 (pCZ1) resulted in a significant reduction in bacterial loads in mouse tissues and a greater degree of protection against a lethal S. Choleraesuis dose compared with the effects observed after SLT30 (pCZ1) or SLT32 (pCZ1) immunization (100% vs. 80% or 70% vs. 50%, respectively). In addition, all four vaccines conferred complete protection against S. Typhimurium challenge. Overall, our study demonstrates that regulated delayed attenuation via an araC P-BAD-regulated crp gene can enhance the cross-protection by Salmonella vectored vaccines expressing heterologous OPS, and strain SLT31 (pCZ1) is a good candidate vaccine for preventing both S. Typhimurium and S. Choleraesuis infections. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Adjuvants have been proven to be very effective in enhancement of immune response of many antigens. However, few studies involved head-to-head comparison of their potentials in inactive rabies virus vaccine. In this study, we investigated two types of aluminum adjuvants and five other adjuvants (BLPs, AS02, AS03, MF59 and Poly I:C) on their capacity in enhancing the efficacy of rabies vaccine. The differences in immunogenicity and potency of rabies vaccines with different adjuvants were evaluated by immunizations in ICR mice. Compared with other adjuvants, nano-sized aluminum induced earlier and more vigorous production of rabies virus neutralizing antibodies and facilitated a more effective protection in the challenge test. Based on these results, to comprehensively and systematically explore the role of adjuvants in rabies vaccine immunization, blood samples from four groups were chosen to perform mRNA sequencing. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of groups were identified, both gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses were conducted for these DEGs. The results showed that there were significant differences in mRNA expression between the mice after immunization with different adjuvants, but the two aluminum adjuvant vaccines induced similar gene expression. Moreover, the data of enrichment analysis indicated that adjuvants were more advantageous in activating the pathways associated with antigen processing, presentation and initial immunity. These results revealed that adjuvants can be used as an enhancer in rabies vaccination, and nano-sized aluminum may be a candidate adjuvant for the development of more effective rabies vaccines. And these data also provide a basis for understanding the mechanisms underlying adjuvants enhancement of the immune response. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Influenza A H7N9 virus has caused five outbreak waves of human infections in China since 2013 and posed a dual challenge to public health and poultry industry. There is an urgent need to develop an effective vaccine to reduce its pandemic potential. In the present study, we evaluated the biochemical characteristics and immunogenicity of two H7 virus-like particles (VLPs) composed of the matrix 1 (M1) and hemagglutinin of wild-type (HA-WT) or hemagglutinin of whose transmembrane domain replaced by that from H3N2 subtype (HA-TM). H7 VLPs-WT and H7 VLPs-TM could assemble and release into the supernatant of Sf9 cells and they had similar morphological characteristics. However, compared to H7 VLPs-WT, H7 VLPs-TM had more trimeric HA proteins and could better resist thermal changes. In mice H7 VLPs-TM induced higher titers of HI, IgG, IgG2a and IFN-gamma, and provided better protection against homologous and heterologous H7N9 viruses (no matter belonging to Yangtze River Delta or Pearl River Delta) challenge with less weight loss and higher survival rate. In summary, H7 VLPs-TM represents a potential strategy for the development of H7N9 vaccines. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In the United States, herpes zoster (HZ) and related complications are estimated to result in approximately $1.3 billion in medical care costs and $1.7 billion in indirect costs annually. In this study, we compared the cost-effectiveness of a new Adjuvanted Recombinant Zoster Vaccine (RZV), containing recombinant varicella-zoster virus glycoprotein E and the ASO1(B) Adjuvant System, versus No Vaccine, as well as versus the live attenuated HZ vaccine (Zoster Vaccine Live (ZVL)) in subjects aged 60+ years of age (YOA) and other age cohorts aged 50+ YOA. A multi-cohort Markov model was developed which follows 1 million individuals over their remaining lifetimes from the year of vaccination with annual cycle lengths. Second dose compliance for RZV was assumed to be 69%. Efficacy and waning parameters were derived from clinical trials for both vaccines. Epidemiological parameters, costs and utility model inputs were derived from US-specific population-based data. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 3% per year. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis, along with scenario and threshold analysis were carried out to explore the overall uncertainty in the model. The model estimated that, compared to No Vaccine against HZ, RZV would prevent 103,603 HZ cases, 11,197 postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) cases, and 14,455 other complications, at an incremental cost of $11,863 per quality-adjusted life-year saved from a societal perspective. Compared to ZVL, the model estimated that, RZV would prevent 71,638 additional HZ cases, 6403 PHN cases, and over 10,582 other complications, resulting in net total societal cost savings of over $96 million. The results were robust to a wide range of sensitivity analyses. Vaccination against HZ with RZV is cost-effective compared to No Vaccine and cost-saving compared to ZVL, in the US population aged 60+ YOA. (C) 2018 GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals SA.

ID CHALLENGES; DELIVERY; IMPACT
AB Ambient temperature filter dried vaccine formulations have been proposed to simultaneously achieve thermostability and offer a ready-to-use immunisation device that combines reconstitution and injection. Vaccine concentration should be uniform at the point of injection, but the uniformity following direct reconstitution of filter-dried vaccines has not been reported. We present here a study of vaccine mixing and release following dissolution of filter-dried model protein and toxoid antigens within a single syringe, filter and needle unit. Release was better for filters made from glass than cellulose. Without additional mixing, uniformity was poor and only 41% of input protein was released from protein filter-dried onto glass fiber. In contrast, adding a simple glass bead and mixing by inversion, 100% release antigen solution was achieved, with uniform concentration at exit from the needle throughout a simulated injection. Adsorption onto alum adjuvant had no detectable effect on vaccine dissolution and mixing. The uniformity and yield of low doses of diphtheria and tetanus toxoid was also improved by mixing, albeit with a lower yield of 60-68%. We conclude that uniformity and mixing should be studied to ensure safety and efficacy of directly reconstituted filter-dried vaccine formulations. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Men who have sex with men (MSM) are recommended the Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination due to their higher risk of genital warts and anal cancer.
   Purpose: To examine HPV vaccine acceptability amongst MSM in the UK.
   Methods: Using advertisements via Facebook, MSM were recruited to an online survey measuring motivations for HPV vaccination. Logistic regression was performed to identify predictors of HPV vaccine acceptability.
   Results: Out of 1508 MSM (median age = 22, range: 14-63 years) only 19% knew about HPV. Overall, 55% of MSM were willing to ask for the HPV vaccine and 89% would accept it if offered by a healthcare professional (HCP). Access to sexual health clinics (SHCs) [OR = 1.82, 95% CI 1.29-2.89], the disclosure of sexual orientation to a HCP [OR = 2.02, CI 1.39-3.14] and HIV-positive status [OR = 1.96, CI 1.09-3.53] positively predicted HPV vaccine acceptability. After receiving information about HPV, perceptions of HPV risk [OR = 1.31, CI 1.05-1.63], HPV infection severity [OR = 1.89, CI 1.16-3.01), HPV vaccination benefits [OR= 1.61, CI 1.14-3.01], HPV vaccine effectiveness [OR= 1.54, CI 1.14-2.08], and the lack of perceived barriers to HPV vaccination [OR = 4.46, CI 2.95-6.73] were also associated with acceptability.
   Conclusions: Although nearly half of MSM would not actively pursue HPV vaccination, the vast majority would accept the vaccine if recommended by HCPs. In order to achieve optimal uptake, vaccine promotion campaigns should focus on MSM who do not access SHCs and those unwilling to disclose their sexual orientation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Estimation of the effectiveness of rotavirus vaccines via the test-negative control study design has gained popularity over the past few years. In this study design, children with severe diarrhea who test positive for rotavirus infection are considered as cases, while children who test negative serve as controls. We use a simple probability model to evaluate and compare the test-negative control and the traditional case control designs with respect to the bias of resulting estimates of rotavirus vaccine effectiveness (VE). Comparisons are performed under two scenarios, corresponding to studies performed in high-income and low-income countries. We consider two potential sources of bias: (a) misclassification bias resulting from imperfect sensitivity and specificity of the test used to diagnose rotavirus infection, and (b) selection bias associated with possible effect of rotavirus vaccination on the probability of contracting severe nonrotavirus diarrhea.
   Our results suggest that both sources of bias may produce VE estimates with substantial bias. Particularly, lack of perfect specificity is associated with severe negative bias. For example, if the specificity of the diagnostic test is 90% then VE estimates from both types of case-control studies may underestimate the true VE by more than 20%. If the vaccine protects children against non-rotavirus diarrhea then VE estimates from test-negative control studies may be close to zero even though the true VE is 50%. However, the sensitivity and specificity of the enzyme immunoassay test currently used to diagnose rotavirus infections are both over 99%, and there is no solid evidence that the existing rotavirus vaccines affect the rates of non-rotavirus diarrhea. We therefore conclude that the test-negative control study design is a convenient and reliable alternative for estimation of rotavirus VE. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Identifying the drivers of vaccine adoption decisions under varying levels of perceived disease risk and benefit provides insight into what can limit or enhance vaccination uptake. To address the relationship of perceived benefit relative to temporal and spatial risk, we surveyed 432 pastoralist households in northern Tanzania on vaccination for foot-and-mouth disease (FMD). Unlike human health vaccination decisions where beliefs regarding adverse, personal health effects factor heavily into perceived risk, decisions for animal vaccination focus disproportionately on dynamic risks to animal productivity. We extended a commonly used stated preference survey methodology, willingness to pay, to elicit responses for a routine vaccination strategy applied biannually and an emergency strategy applied in reaction to spatially variable, hypothetical outbreaks. Our results show that households place a higher value on vaccination as perceived risk and household capacity to cope with resource constraints increase, but that the episodic and unpredictable spatial and temporal spread of FMD contributes to increased levels of uncertainty regarding the benefit of vaccination. In addition, concerns regarding the performance of the vaccine underlie decisions for both routine and emergency vaccination, indicating a need for within community messaging and documentation of the household and population level benefits of FMD vaccination.

AB Purpose: Hispanic women experience a disproportionate burden of cervical cancer morbidity and mortality compared to non-Hispanic women. Increasing HPV vaccination among Hispanic adolescents can help alleviate disparities. This study aimed to identify parental psychosocial predictors associated with HPV vaccine initiation and correlates of parental intentions to obtain the vaccine for their Hispanic adolescent daughters aged 11-17 years.
   Methods: This study is part of a larger three-arm randomized controlled trial testing the effectiveness of interventions to increase HPV vaccination. Parents of adolescent females were recruited in community clinics where we conducted baseline surveys. We obtained electronic medical records six months after baseline to assess vaccination status. Multilevel logistic regression was used to identify correlates of parental intentions to vaccinate and predictors of HPV vaccine initiation. Analyses with initiation as the outcome also controlled for intervention study arm. The Integrated Behavioral Model guided selection of psychosocial and outcome variables.
   Results: Our sample (n = 765) consisted mostly of mothers with less than a high school education born outside of the U.S. Forty-one percent had a household income less than $15,000. Most daughters had public or private insurance. Twenty-one percent initiated the HPV vaccine series. Correlates of intention to vaccinate intention included subjective norms related to daughter's doctor (AOR = 1.04; 95% CI 1.01-1.07), belief that the vaccine is safe (AOR = 1.38; 95% CI 1.06-1.78), self-efficacy to obtain the vaccine for their daughter (AOR = 2.39; 95% CI 1.52-3.77), and parental concern about vaccine side effects (AOR = 0.73; 95% CI 0.60-0.89). Intentions predicted initiation (AOR = 2.01; 95% CI 1.10-5.26); concern about sexual disinhibition decreased the odds of having a vaccinated daughter at follow-up (AOR = 0.66; 95% CI 0.47-0.92).
   Discussion: Parental intention and concerns about sexual disinhibition predict vaccine initiation. Further research is needed to explore the role of intention as a potential mediator between psychosocial variables and vaccination status. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID HUMAN-PAPILLOMAVIRUS; VACCINE; INFECTION
AB Background: The Arab states geographic region is marked by a low to moderate cervical cancer screening coverage rates and the absence of national human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination programs, except for the United Arab Emirates. Knowing that the HPV prevalence among Tunisian woman is estimated to 4.9/100 000 according to the "HPV Center" data, this study aims to estimate the cost of a national cervical cancer prevention program in Tunisia using either the primary prevention method (the two-dose schedule anti-HPV vaccine according to the WHO recommendation for young adolescents) or the secondary prevention method (the Pap smear test according to three time-lapse periodicity).
   Methods: The mean incremental cost of one avoided cervical cancer case was calculated for each prevention scenario.
   Results: The ascending incremental costs by avoided cervical cancer case are: 1- the national vaccination program through the GAVI support ($ 1803), 2- the cervical cancer screening according to 10-year periodicity ($ 8219), 3- the cervical cancer screening according to 5-year periodicity ($ 14,567), 4- the cervical cancer screening according to 3-year periodicity ($ 20,479), 5- and finally the national vaccination program according to the manufacturer marketed price ($ 36,854).
   Conclusion: Currently, the anti-HPV national vaccination program combined with cervical cancer screening according to 5-year periodicity present the best cost-effective strategy for cervical cancer prevention in Tunisia. This study gives Tunisian decision makers a basis for structured planning and cost apportionment to ensure effective roll-out of the cervical cancer prevention strategies. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Current influenza vaccines do not provide effective protection against heterologous influenza viruses. The ability of the novel M2SR influenza vaccine to protect against drifted influenza viruses was evaluated in naive ferrets and in ferrets with pre-existing immunity to influenza. In naive ferrets, M2SR provided similar protection against drifted challenge viruses as the comparator vaccine, FluMist (R). However, in ferrets with pre-existing immunity, M2SR provided superior protection than FluMist in two model systems.
   In the first model, ferrets were infected with influenza A H1N1pdm and influenza B viruses to mimic the diverse influenza exposure in humans. The pre-infected ferrets, seropositive to H1N1pdm and influenza B but seronegative to H3N2, were then vaccinated with H3N2 M2SR or monovalent H3N2 FluMist virus (A/Brisbane/10/2007, Glade 1) and challenged 6 weeks later with a drifted H3N2 virus (Glade 3C.2a). Antibody titers to Brisbane/10/2007 were higher in M2SR vaccinated ferrets than in FluMist vaccinated ferrets in the pre-infected ferrets whereas the opposite was observed in naive ferrets. After challenge with drifted H3N2 virus, M2SR provided superior protection than FluMist monovalent vaccine.
   In the second model, the impact of homologous pre-existing immunity upon vaccine-induced protection was evaluated. Ferrets, pre-infected with H1N1pdm virus, were vaccinated 90 days later with H1N1pdm M2SR or FluMist monovalent vaccine and challenged 6 weeks later with a pre-pandemic seasonal H1N1 virus, A/Brisbane/59/2007 (Bris59). While cross-reactive serum IgG antibodies against the Bris59 HA were detected after vaccination, anti-Bris59 hemagglutination inhibition antibodies were only detected post-challenge. M2SR provided better protection against Bris59 challenge than FluMist suggesting that homologous pre-existing immunity affected FluMist virus to a greater degree than M2SR.
   These results suggest that the single replication intranasal M2SR vaccine provides effective protection against drifted influenza A viruses not only in naive ferrets but also in those with pre-existing immunity in contrast to FluMist viruses. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB We have recently demonstrated the effectiveness of an intranasal immunization approach against Neospora caninum infection in immunosufficient mice. Generated evidence indicated that antibodies could be mediating the observed protection. We similarly immunized IL-12/IL-23 p40 chain-deficient (Il12b(-/-)) mice, which have impaired cellular immunity, to further explore the host protective mechanism conferred by the used immunization strategy. The immunized mice presented lower parasitic burdens after intraperitoneal infection with N. caninum and also had elevated levels of parasite-specific antibodies. However, passive immunization with antibodies purified from immunized donors conferred only limited protection to infected Il12b(-/-) recipients. Despite their intrinsic IL-12 deficiency, the immunized Il12b(-/-) mice mounted a parasite-specific immune response that was mediated by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). Neutralization of IFN-gamma in the immunized mice abrogated the observed protective effect of the immunization. These results show altogether that the used immunization strategy overcome the cellular immunity defect of Il12b(-/- )mice and conferred protection from N. caninum infection. The observed protective effect was predominantly mediated by IFN-gamma and to a lesser extent but non-negligibly by IgG antibodies. These results also highlight that in a host with compromised cellular immunity, the immune response against intracellular pathogens could be markedly boosted by immunization. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Disparities in human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination completion have been noted among sexual and gender minority (SGM) people. Little is known about factors associated with HPV vaccination among SGM people. This study examines factors linked with completion of HPV vaccination among SGM patients.
   Methods: We collected cross-sectional data from electronic health records (EHRs) of SGM patients receiving primary care at a Boston community health center specialized in SGM health. We employed a binomial logistic regression model to identify factors associated with 3-dose HPV vaccine completion.
   Results: Patients were 70.3% white, with mean age of 26.3 years (SD = 2.48), 26.9% identifying as gender minorities and 79% as sexual minorities, 48.9% with 4-year college or graduate degrees, 59.4% employed, 65.9% with private insurance, 39.1% living at or below the federal poverty level, and 8.3% living with HIV. Seventy-seven percent of patients who were offered HPV vaccination had completed the series. Factors significantly associated with HPV vaccine completion included: 4-year college or graduate degree (OR: 2.87; 95% Cl = 1.26-6.53), completion of primary care appointments (OR: 1.03; 95% CI: 1.01-1.05), Hepatitis A or B vaccine completion (OR: 2.59; 95% CI: 1.2-5.59), and visits for a sexually transmitted infection (STI) screen (OR: 1.22; 95% CI: 1.03-1.43).
   Conclusion: Vaccine completion was higher among SGM with higher levels of education, Hepatitis A or B vaccination, and completed health visits. These findings highlight potential ways to increase HPV vaccination, such as offering tailored HPV vaccine education, bundling with other vaccines, and incorporating HPV vaccination with STI screenings.
