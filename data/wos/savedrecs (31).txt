AB Term weighting is an essential step to process textual data and generate input data (vector) for machine learning algorithms. In order to appropriately represent documents into computable forms for a certain task (such as text classification, clustering, sentiment analysis, recommendation and information retrieval), semantic term weighting which considers term meanings is significant for specific applications of machine learning. Two challenging issues of semantic term weighting for clinical texts are how to determine the meaning of a medical term in a given clinical text and how to give semantic weights for a huge amount of distinct terms in clinical texts. To address those challenges, this work proposes a two-phase framework for determining semantic weights of terms in clinical texts. The proposed framework derives a two-part hierarchy where each of the nodes is categories of terms. All terms in a clinical text is classified into the categories in the hierarchy and terms in the leaf nodes are assigned with the same semantic weights. Fundamentally, the deeper the hierarchy, the higher the semantic weights. The first phase classifies all terms into the categories which are commonly significant for any tasks, by using UMLS and icp-10. These categories are organized at the first part of the hierarchy. The second phase flexibly organizes specific categories for a certain task as the second part of the hierarchy as well as the subcategories of the first part, by specific medical domain knowledge regarding the aspect under consideration. The implementation of the proposed framework for mortality prediction with semantic weights is validated by experimental comparative evaluation using the well-known EMRs database MIMIC II. The experimental results showed that the performance is considerably improved when combining frequency-based weights and semantic weights with its significant difference derived from a paired t-test. Although the proposed framework can be applied to only medical domain, various tasks in medical domain can be covered by the proposed framework which flexibly organizes the second part (deeper levels in the hierarchy) by specific medical knowledge regarding the aspect under consideration.

AB As a new and competitive population-based optimization algorithm, the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) outperforms some other biological-inspired algorithms from the perspective of simplicity and efficiency. However, WOA will get stuck into local optima and degrade accuracy for large-scale global optimization (LSGO) problems. To address the issue, a modified Whale Optimization Algorithm (MWOA) is proposed for solving LSGO problems. In order to balance the exploration and exploitation abilities, a nonlinear dynamic strategy based on a cosine function for updating the control parameter is given. A Levy-flight strategy is adopted to make the algorithm jump out of local optima. Moreover, a quadratic interpolation method is applied to the leader of the population, which enhances the local exploitation ability and improves the solution accuracy. MWOA is tested over 25 well-known benchmark functions with dimensions ranging from 100 to 1000. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of MWOA on LSGO, in terms of solution accuracy, convergence speed, and stability compared with other state-of-the-art optimization algorithms.

AB Tourist arrival and tourist demand forecasting are a crucial issue in tourism economy and the community economic development as well. Tourist demand forecasting has attracted much attention from tourism academics as well as industries. In recent year, it attracts increasing attention in the computational literature as advances in machine learning method allow us to construct models that significantly improve the precision of tourism prediction. In this paper, we draw upon both strands of the literature and propose a novel paired neural network model. The tourist arrival data is decomposed by two low-pass filters into long-term trend and short-term seasonal components, which are then modelled by a pair of autore-gressive neural network models as a parallel structure. The proposed model is evaluated by the tourist arrival data to United States from twelve source markets. The empirical studies show that our proposed paired neural network model outperforming the selected benchmark model across all error measures and over different horizons. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Hospitals are the main sub-section of health care systems and evaluation of hospitals is one of the most important issue for health policy makers. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is a nonparametric method that has recently been used for measuring efficiency and productivity of Decision Making Units (DMUs) and commonly applied for comparison of hospitals. However, one of the important assumption in DEA is that DMUs must be homogenous. The crucial issue in hospital efficiency is that hospitals are providing different services and so may not be comparable. In this paper, we propose an integrated fuzzy clustering cooperative game DEA approach. In fact, due to the lack of homogeneity among DMUs, we first propose to use a fuzzy C-means technique to cluster the DMUs. Then we apply DEA combined with the game theory where each DMU is considered as a player, using Core and Shapley value approaches within each cluster. The procedure has successfully been applied for performances measurement of 288 hospitals in 31 provinces of Iran. Finally, since the classical DEA model is not capable to distinguish between efficient DMUs, efficient hospitals within each cluster, are ranked using combined DEA model and cooperative game approach. The results show that the Core and Shapley values are suitable for fully ranking of efficient hospitals in the healthcare systems. (C) 2018 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID MATRIX FACTORIZATION
AB Recommendation methods have been proved to be successful in eliminating the information overload problem. However, they are still insufficient as far as data sparsity and cold start issues are concerned. Some approaches have attempted to resolve these issues by utilizing relevant information contained in user review text, although, the type of information extracted from the review text and the way such recommendation methods utilize the information affect recommendation accuracy of the models. In this paper, we address such challenges by considering linguistic similarity between review texts and employ it as additional factor in rating prediction, and we propose a recommendation method based on tensor factorization which involves review text semantic similarity. The proposed tensor factorization model supplements the central task of factorization methods of finding similar users, uncovering underlying characteristics of the data and predicting user preferences by introducing text semantic similarity. The proposed method is carried out in two main phases; first phase, by computing semantic similarity between review texts and assigning a similarity score, and second phase by introducing the similarity score as an additional factor in the probabilistic matrix factorization (PMF) model. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, several Amazon datasets were experimented and the results verify that the semantic similarity of review texts not only successfully portray user preferences, and extend PMF to include review texts similarities but also increases prediction influence which results in improved performance.

AB Members of the LEUNIG gene family have recently emerged as key players in gene repression, affecting several developmental mechanisms in plants, especially flower development. LEUNIG proteins function via recruiting adaptor SEUSS proteins. Nevertheless, no systematic studies on the LEUNIG and SEUSS gene families have been undertaken in tomato (Solanam lycopersicum, a fleshy fruit-bearing model plant, belonging to the Solanaceae family). Here, we present the results of a genome-wide analysis of tomato LEUNIG and SEUSS genes. In our study, we identified three SILUG and four SISEU genes. All three SILUG full-length proteins contained the LEUNIG canonical domains (LUFS and two WD40 repeats), and the four full-length SISEU genes contained the Lim-binding domain. All the members of the SILUG and SISEU family proteins were localized to the nucleus. All the SISEU and SILUG genes were detected in the tomato tissues tested. Expression analysis showed that the SILUGs and SISEUs exhibited tissue-specific expression, and that they responded to exogenous plant hormone and stress treatment. Protein-protein interaction analysis showed that only SILUGs, but not SISEUs, interacted with SIYABBY. Only a weak interaction between SILUG1 and SISEU3 was observed among all the SILUG and SISEU proteins. Taken together, these findings may help elucidate the roles played by SILUG and SISEU family members in plant growth and development.

AB In this review, we specifically focus on genetic modifications of oncolytic adenovirus 5 (Ad5)-based vectors that enhance replication, oncolysis/spread, and virus-mediated tumor immunosurveillance. The finding of negative regulation of minor core protein V by SUMOylation led to the identification of amino acid residues, which when mutated increase adenovirus replication and progeny yield. Suppression of Dicer and/or RNAi pathway with shRNA or p19 tomato bushy stunt protein also results in significant enhancement of adenovirus replication and progeny yield. Truncation mutations in E3-19K or i-leader sequence or overexpression of adenovirus death protein (ADP) potently increase adenovirus progeny release and spread without affecting virus yield. Moreover, E3-19K protein, which was found to inhibit both major histocompatibility complex I (MHCI) and MHC-I chain related A and B proteins (MICA/MICB) expression on the cell surface, protecting infected cells from T-lymphocyte and natural killer (NK) cell attack, may be tailored to selectively target only MHCI or MICA/MICB, or to lose the ability to downregulate both. At last, E3-19K protein may be exploited to deliver tumor-associated epitopes directly to the endoplasmic reticulum for loading MHCI in the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP)-deregulated cells.

AB Osteoporosis is a metabolic bone disorder characterized by low bone mineral density and decreased bone strength, leading to an increased risk of fractures with a consequent increase in morbidity and mortality. The current methods to estimate the fracture risk are very limited. microRNAs (miRNAs) have been considered as good biomarkers for many pathological processes, including osteoporosis. Some circulating miRNAs are associated with regulation of bone formation and differentiation of bone cells. The aim of this study, was to analyze the expression of miRNAs in serum of patients with osteoporosis (n = 20) and healthy controls (n = 20). Expression of 754 miRNAs was analyzed through quantitative real time RT-PCR arrays. Seven miRNAs showed significant differences between groups. The microRNAs miR-23b-3p, miR-140-3p and miR-885-5p were selected based on fold change and p-values (40.5, p = 0.038, 20.7, p = 0.045, and 2.2, p = 0.002; respectively) for validation in independent serum samples from patients with osteopenia (n = 28), osteoporosis (n = 26) and osteoporotic hip fracture (n = 21). After validation, we confirm differences across the groups for miR-23b-3p and miR-140-3p. Our data pointed miR-140-3p and miR-23b-3p as potential biomarkers candidates for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.

AB The X-inactive-specific transcript (XIST/Xist) is one of the first long non-coding RNAs discovered in mammals and plays an essential role in X chromosome inactivation. XIST is dysregulated and acts as an oncogene or a tumor suppressor in different human malignancies. XIST is implicated in many aspects of carcinogenesis including tumor initiation, invasion, metastasis, apoptosis, cell cycle, sternness, autophagy, and drug resistance. This review focuses on research progress on the roles of XIST in tumor development. The multiple pathological functions of XIST in various cancers are systematically reviewed to elucidate the molecular basis of its biological roles and to provide new directions for future research.

AB Breast Cancer is the most common cancer among women with several genes involved in disease susceptibility. As majority of genome-wide significant variants fall outside the coding region, it is likely that some of them alter specific gene functions. GWAS database was used to interpret the regulatory functions of these genetic variants. A total of 320 SNPs for breast cancer were selected via GWAS, which were entered into the SNAP web portal tool, to determine the one's found to be in Linkage Disequilibrium (r(2) < 0.80). The resulting 2024 proxy SNP's were processed in RegulomeDB to predict their regulatory role. Of these, 1440 produced a score ranging from 1-6, whereas the remaining produced no data. Only the variants under score 4 (cut-off value) in RegulomeDB has been studied further. From these variants, 221 had scores of less than 4, indicating a high degree of potential regulatory role associated with them. Further study revealed that 61 of the 221 SNPs were reported to be genome-wide significant for breast cancer, 52 to be associated with other diseases, 99 as unconfirmed for association with breast cancer, leaving only 9 to be novel proxy SNPs linked to breast cancer. Therefore, the study further confirmed postulation of non-coding variants being linked to disease risk thereby, requiring additional validation through genome-wide association studies to substantiate their underlying mechanism.

AB Background: Glioma is a wide category of brain tumor originates from glial cells. Lower-Grade Glioma (LGG) consists of World Health Organization (WHO) grade II and grade III gliomas. Since the LGGs can infiltrate into adjacent areas, the complete removal of tumor is difficult and it results in recurrence and malignant progression to high grade glioma. Our study uncovers robust survival indicators in LGG which can be checked by immunohistochemistry to predict the outcome of lower grade. In addition, it unravelled the novel therapeutic targets in order to improve the survival of LGG patients.
   Methods: To identify a prognostic signature based on protein expression in LGGs, we analysed Reverse Phase Protein Array data of LGG samples (n = 380) from The Cancer Genome Atlas cohort. We made random stratification of samples into discovery (n = 228) and validation datasets (n = 152). We performed multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis of proteins (n = 219) using discovery dataset with age, WHO grade and IDH mutation status.
   Results: We identified four-protein prognostic signature that can segregate patients into high- and low-risk. The signature estimates poor overall survival for high-risk patients in both discovery (hazard ratio [HR] = 4.11; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.18-7.75; p < 0.0001) and validation datasets (HR = 3.49; 95% CI = 1.52-8.01; p < 0.0001). Among the four markers, CHK2_pT68 was found to be protective, while MSH6, ARID1A and PAXILLIN were associated with poor survival. Additionally, Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis of this signature with age, WHO grade and IDH mutation status revealed this prognostic signature to be an independent prognosticator in both datasets.
   Conclusions: Our finding discovered a set of potential protein biomarkers to predict survival and it will help in the subsequent treatment management of LGG patients.

AB Transposable elements (TEs) are mobile DNA sequences on genomes. Some elements are able to transpose in somatic cells, a process known as somatic transposition (ST), which has been associated with detrimental biological effects. The mariner-Mos1 element of Drosophila promotes transposition in somatic and germline cells and is an excellent model for studies related to the biological consequence of somatic excision (SE). In this work, we used temperature stress to induce increasing transposition of mariner-Mos1 during different stages of the development of D. simulans, aiming to quantify SE during lifespan. Furthermore, strains of D. melanogaster exhibiting differential expression of mariner-Mos1 were employed for estimating some biological consequences of mariner mobilization. It is shown that SE of mariner-Mos1 was not constant during development; the larval phase had the highest rates while the pupal stage exhibited lower rates, and in the embryonic stage, no difference was detected. SE can be detrimental, as suggested by correlation in SE level and reduction in behavioral activities and embryonic viability. This study showed that mariner-Mos1 SE accumulates during the Drosophila life cycle, and can be involved in detrimental effects.

AB The Bama mini-pig (BM pig) is an inbred strain of the Bama Xiang pig (BX pig) and an important animal model used for studying human diseases. The extremely long inbreeding period renders a clear distinction between the features of the BM and BX strains, such as in their metabolism and olfactory system. However, there is limited information about differences between BM and BX animals at the genomic level. In this study, we generated genome sequencing data and used the assembly-vs-assembly approach to evaluate the phenotypic variations caused by inbreeding in these strains. Moreover, we detected differential expression of mutant genes related to the phenotypes in BX and BM pigs. We sequenced the genome of the BX pig strain and performed a series of analyses to reveal the comprehensive inbred genetic variants between BX and BM pigs. Here, the 2.56-Gb draft genome assembly for the BX pig and an N50 contig length of approximately 11.87 kb is described, and an N50 scaffold length of approximately 99 kb and the variations in the BX pig genome were identified by comparison with the BM pig reference genome. There were 1,424,354 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 2,961,891 insertions and deletions (indels), 13,772 structural variants (SVs), and 20,606 copy number variants (CNVs) identified in the BX genome. Functional annotation of SVs and CNVs showed that the genes (ADGRE2, GPR143, olfactory receptor 52B4-like, olfactory receptor 10H1-like and SHROOM2) with both SVs and CNVs were enriched in the most of all KEGG pathways and gene ontology (GO) terms of mutant genes. ADGRE2, GPR143 and SHROOM2 were both found to have significant higher expression levels in BX pigs than in BM pigs. In the contrary, the expressions of olfactory receptor 52B4-like and olfactory receptor 10H1-like were significant lower in BX pigs than in BM pigs. In conclusion, sequence analysis of the BX pig genome revealed that the genome structure of the two pig strains has considerable genomic variation that was caused by the long inbreeding period. Moreover, qRT-PCR analysis of the mutant genes displayed a significant distinction that may be associated with phenotypic differences between these pig strains.

AB Fruit quality formation involves a series of physiological and biochemical changes during fruit ripening. Sucrose metabolism plays not only important roles in fruit ripening to establish energy status and nutritional quality but also a non-nutritive role in gene expression. In carbon metabolism and fruit ripening, cell wall invertases (CWINs) perform essential regulatory functions. Knowledge regarding the gene expression changes that occur following the repression of CWIN activity in fruit through the overexpression of a cell-wall inhibitor of beta-fructosidase (CIF) under a fruit-specific promoter is limited. To further explore the molecular mechanism of sucrose regulation, global expression profiling of the fruits of transgenic tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) plants carrying a cell wall invertase inhibitor (SlC1F1) gene was performed using a microarray. In total, 622 and 833 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. The expression of the SlHSP17.7 gene was increased by thousands of times in the transgenic-SlCIF1 tomato. Then, SlHSP17.7-RNA interference (RNAi) lines were generated by introducing pB7GWIWG2 (I)-SlHSP17.7 into wild-type chmielewskii tomatoes (NT). The sucrose and fructose contents significantly decreased in the RNAi fruits compared with those in the WT. Furthermore, 14 sugar metabolism related genes were also decreased synergistically by silencing SlHSP17.7 gene. Our data indicate that the posttranslational modulation of CWIN activity by SlCIFI contributes to earlier bloom times. SlHSP17.7 and sugar can interact to regulate the development of tomato fruit and affect the quality of tomato, providing a different insight into improving the quality of tomato.

AB Flowering process is essential for plant development. However, the molecular mechanisms driving flower development of ornamental woody Rhododendron pulchrum Sweet are difficult to elucidate due to the lack of genomic data. In this research, high-throughput sequencing and comparative transcriptome analyses of R. pulchrum flowers collected at three key stages were performed: floral bud stage, early flowering stage, and full-flowering stage. Furthermore, expression of genes involved in flower development was also validated with quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). RNA-seq yielded 96,350,697 bp of clean reads, which were assembled into 98,610 unigenes with an average length of 717 bp. 58,279 (59.10%) unigenes could be annotated, including 324 major unigenes associated with floral development. In addition, ten modules (20,443 mRNAs) were dissected in the co-expression network. Especially, Flowering Locus (FLC) and Flowering Locus T (FT) were co-expressed. 9493 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were scanned among three stages, and most DEGs existed between flower bud stage and early flowering stage. In particular, 79 DGEs associated with flowering process were enriched in 28 GO terms. Moreover, the expression levels of MYC2, EIN3, and ARR-B were all lowest at early flowering stage, while transcripts of MYC2, TIR1, CYCD3, COL-1, and EIN3 were all peaked at flower bud stage. Transcriptome profile presented here will benefit deep insights into molecular mechanism underlying R. pulchrum flowering process.

AB Numerous long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are reported to be dysregulated in glioma. However, how IncRNA participates in the process of glioma development and progression still remains elusive. Here, we identified a novel lncRNA LOC728196 highly expressed in glioma tissues. LOC728196 high expression predicts low survival rate in patients. Our data proved that LOC728196 knockdown repressed cellular growth, migration and invasion in vitro. Silencing LOC728196 led to impaired growth of glioma in vivo. Mechanistic studies further demonstrated that LOC728196 acts as the sponge for miR-513c to upregulate TCF7 expression. We observed a reciprocal inhibition between LOC728196 and miR-513c. Rescue assay showed that either inhibition of miR-513c or TCF7 overexpression restored the abilities of proliferation, migration and invasion in LOC728196-silenced glioma cells. Taken together, our study provides a comprehensive investigation on the role of LOC728196 in glioma progression and contributes to understanding the vital role of competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA).

AB Malfunction of apoptosis plays a key role in carcinogenesis. Previous studies have reported that polymorphisms in caspase genes could lead to poor apoptotic signaling, thus facilitating the onset of several human cancers. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between three polymorphisms (rs1049216, rs2705897 and rs4647603) of the CASP3 gene and the risk of prostate cancer (PCa) in Galicia (NW Spain).The relationship between these single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and PCa in European populations has yet to be studied. To test this hypothesis, we carried out a case-control study on a total of 243 patients with PCa and 191 healthy individuals, genotyping all polymorphisms using the matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) method. Overall, none of the polymorphisms were clearly associated with the risk of PCa. Nevertheless, the results drawn from this study suggest that genetic variability in the CASP3 gene, in combination with lifestyle and environmental factors may influence the predisposition to develop PCa in the Galician population. Specifically, the results of study seem to hint at a higher risk of PCa in smokers of up to 20 pack-years (PY) and carriers of both the CASP3-rs1049216 GG genotype and the G allele (OR = 3.61, p = 0.044; OR = 1.71; p = 0.018). In addition, the GG and AG genotypes showed increased predisposition to PCa in overweight individuals (OR = 4.43, p = 0.040; OR = 2.00; p = 0.022). Finally, the CASP3-rs4647603 CT genotype and T allele were associated with a higher susceptibility to PCa in obese individuals (ORCT/TT = 4.30, p = 0.003; ORT/C = 3.58, p = 0.004). Further replication studies in other populations are required to assess these findings.

AB Purpose: We performed this study to better assess the relationship between serotonin transporter (SEAT) insertion/deletion polymorphism and the risk of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
   Methods: Eligible studies were searched in PubMed, Medline, Embase and CNKI. A total of 27 studies with 7039 participants were analyzed.
   Results: Significant association with the risk of IBS was detected for the SERT insertion/deletion polymorphism in additive comparison (p < 0.0001). Further subgroup analyses according to ethnicity of participants revealed that the SERT insertion/deletion polymorphism was significantly associated with the risk of IBS in Asians (dominant model: p = 0.001; recessive model: p = 0.0003; allele model: p = 0.001) and Caucasians (dominant model: p = 0.04; additive model: p < 0.0001). When we stratified available data according to type of disease, we found that the SERT insertion/deletion polymorphism was significantly correlated with the risk of constipation predominant IBS (IBS-C) in recessive comparison (p = 0.04). However, no positive results were detected in the diarrhea predominant IBS (IBS-D) and mixture of diarrhea and constipation IBS (IBS-M) subgroups.
   Conclusions: Our findings indicated that the SERT insertion/deletion polymorphism may serve as a genetic biomarker of IBS in Asians and Caucasians.

AB Molecular alterations that occur in cancer have the potential to be considered as either cancer biomarkers or targeted therapies or even both. In the presented study, we aimed to elucidate the gene regulatory network of metastatic colorectal cancer using data acquired from microarrays to reach the most common DEGs in colorectal cancer metastasis and find their possible regulatory mechanism by DETFs and DEmiRs. In this regards, seven microarray datasets were employed to assess the most important DEGs, DETFs and DEmiRs in colorectal cancer metastasis. Afterward, GRN based on DETFs and DEmiRs were constructed. Also ARACNE algorithm was used to construct an accurate GRN. GRN was analyzed structurally and then, two DETFs (LEF1 and ETV4) and a less-well known DEG (FABP6) by real time qRT-PCR in 50 patients with colorectal cancer were quantified. The constructed GRN highlighted the importance of some DETFs and DEmiRs in colorectal cancer metastasis. Interestingly the gene expression analysis by qRT-PCR on three candidate genes (LEF1, ETV4 and FABP6) indicated that the three genes were co-expressed in tumor samples, and were significantly associated with metastasis in colorectal cancer. Therefore, our experimental results proved a part of our comprehensive data analysis and system biology results. In summary, according to our empirical study we found the importance of three candidate genes as the potent prognostic factors in colorectal cancer metastasis. Also our study in a holistic insight on gene regulatory mechanism revealed the importance of some gene regulatory factors (DETFs and DEmiRs) and their potential as prognostic factors and/or targets in molecular targeted therapies in colorectal cancer.

AB Amerindian ancestry appears to be a risk factor for metabolic diseases (MetD), making Mexicans an ideal population to better understand the genetic architecture of metabolic health. In this study, we determine the association of genetic variants previously reported with metabolic entities, in two Mexican populations, including the largest sample of Amerindians reported to date.
   We investigated the association of eigth single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in AKT1, GCKR, and SOCS3 genes with different metabolic traits in 1923 Mexican Amerindians (MAs) belonging to 57 ethnic groups, and 855 Mestizos (MEZs). The allele frequency of 7/8 SNPs showed significant differences between MAs and MEZs. Interestingly, some alleles were monomorphic in particular ethnic groups, and highly frequent in other ones. With the exception of GCKR rs1260326T, as expected, all SNP frequencies in the MEZ population had intermediate values between its two main ancestral populations (MAs and Iberian populations in Spain [IBS]). We detected ethnic differences in linkage disequilibrium patterns and haplotype structure between MAs and MEZs, possibly due to the high genetic heterogeneity in these populations. Remarkably, AKT1 was associated with hypertension in MEZs, but not in MAs. GCKR was associated with protection against type 2 diabetes (T2D) in MAs, and with hypertriglyceridemia and protection against low HDL Cholesterol (HDL-C) levels in MEZs. The CAT haplotype in SOCS3 was associated with metabolic syndrome (MetS) in MEZs, and correlated with protection against high blood pressure (HBP) and risk for high waist circumference and T2D in MAs. Our results show differential genetic associations with metabolic traits between MAs and MEZs, possibly due to the differences in genetic structure between these Mexican populations.

AB Gene regulatory effects of microRNAs at a posttranscriptional level have been established over the last decade. In this study, we analyze the interaction networks of mRNA translation regulation through intronic miRNA, under various tissue-specific cellular contexts, taking into account the thermodynamic affinity, chemical kinetics, co-localization, concentration levels, network parameters and the presence of competitive interactors. This database, and analysis has been made available through an open-access web-server, miRiam, to promote further exploration. Here we report that expression of genes involved in Apoptosis Processes, Immune System Processes, Translation Regulator Activities, and Molecular Transport Activities within the cell are predominately regulated by miRNA mediation. Our findings further indicate that this regulatory effect has a profound effect in controlling protein crowding inside the cell. A miRNA mediated gene expression regulation serves as a temporal regulator, allowing the cellular machinery to temporarily 'pause' the translation of mRNA, indicating that the miRNA-mRNA interactions may be important for governing the optimal usage of cell volume.

AB Zinc finger proteins (ZNFs) are one of the most abundant proteins in eukaryotic genomes with extraordinarily diverse functions. ZNF233 is located on 19q13.31 and encodes a 670-amino acid protein belonging to the Kruppel C2H2-type ZNF family. However, little is known about the role of ZNF233 in cancer progression. In this study, we reported for the first time that ZNF233 mRNA was remarkably up-regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues in comparison with corresponding non-tumorous normal liver tissues. ZNF233 expression level was correlated with tumor grade, tumor stage and prognosis of HCC patients. We further investigated the effect of ZNF233 on HCC cell growth. It is found that overexpression of ZNF233 in SMMC-7721 could promote Gl/S transition and thus accelerate cell growth ratio. Consistently, knockdown of ZNF233 in QGY-7701 cells successfully suppressed cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Further immunohistochemical staining revealed a reduced Ki-67-positive cell percentage in xenografted tumor derived from ZNF233-knocking down cells. Taken together, these results demonstrate a positive role of ZNF233 in regulating HCC cell growth. ZNF233 might be developed as a novel biomarker and a potential therapeutic target for HCC.

AB The aim of this study was to verify the effects of TwIDI (GenBank: KT279355.1) on triptolide and celastrol accumulation in the biosynthesis of terpenoids in Tripterygium wilfordii and the regulation of the expression of related genes in the triptolide and celastrol biosynthesis pathway. After bioinformatics analysis of TwIDI, we cloned the full-length CDS and a specific 398 bp fragment to construct overexpression and RNAi vectors, respectively. The specific amplification of hygromycin and kanamycin resistance gene fragments confirmed that the expression vectors had been successfully delivered into Tripterygium wilfordii suspension cells. qRT-PCR was used to detect the expression of TwIDI and related genes in the triptolide and celastrol biosynthesis pathway. The expression of TwIDI was increased to 157% of the control group (empty vector) in the overexpression group, and was reduced to 71% of the control group in the RNAi group. Notably, the expression of other genes in the triptolide and celastrol biosynthesis pathway also showed differences. For example, TwMCS was reduced to 62% of the control when TwIDI was overexpressed and increased to 188% in the RNAi group. The expression of TwDXS did not change significantly both during TwIDI overexpression and RNAi group. The accumulation of triptolide and celastrol in the suspension cells of Tripterygium wilfordii was detected by UPLC, revealing that the contents of triptolide and celastrol were increased 1.36- and 1.20-fold over the control group in the overexpression group, and decreased to 0.16 and 0.36 of the control group in the RNAi group. Based on these findings, the effect on the accumulation of active terpenoids in Tripterygium wilfordii and the feedback regulation of genes in the triptolide and celastrol biosynthesis pathway was verified through TwIDI overexpression and RNAi experiments.

AB Pseudorabies virus (PRV) is one of the most vital pathogens of swine, leading to huge economic losses to the pig industry. Functioning in innate immunity, type-I interferon (IFN) plays a vital role in initial stage of viral infection. ISG15, an IFN-stimulated ubiquitin-like protein, is highly increased during virus infection and participates in the IFN-mediated antiviral immune response. However, limited attention has been paid to the functional role of porcine ISG15 (pISG15) in PRV infection. In this study, we generated a PK15 inducible cell line stably expressing the pISG15 gene and investigated the potential anti-PRV response of pISG15. We demonstrated that pISG15 was upregulated in an early stage of PRV infection, and pISG15 overexpression efficiently inhibited PRV replication by reducing the viral titers and mRNA levels of PRV, and also increased expression of IFN-beta and activation of the ISRE promoter. However, knockdown of pISG15 by siRNA did not affect PRV replication, and potentiated IFN-I-mediated signaling, resulting in an increase in antiviral response in the process of PRV infection. The results showed that pISG15 has a potential immunodulatory role in cellular antiviral response against PRV.

AB In mammalian cells TPP1, encoded by the Acd gene, is a key component of the shelterin complex, which is required for telomere length maintenance and telomere protection. In mice, a hypomorphic mutation in Acd causes the adrenocortical dysplasia (acd) phenotype, which includes limb and body axis anomalies, and perinatal lethality. p53 deficiency partially rescues limb and body axis anomalies in acd mutant embryos, but not perinatal lethality, implicating p53-independent mechanisms in the acd phenotype. Loss of function of most shelterin proteins results in early embryonic lethality. Thus, study of the hypomorphic acd allele provides a unique opportunity to understand telomere dysfunction at an organismal level. The aim of this study was to identify transcriptome alterations in acd mutant and acd, p53 double mutant embryos to understand the p53-dependent and -independent factors that contribute to the mutant phenotypes in the context of the whole organism. Genes involved in developmental processes, cell cycle, metabolic pathways, tight junctions, axon guidance and signaling pathways were regulated by p53-driven mechanisms in acd mutant embryos, while genes functioning in immune response, and RNA processing were altered independently of p53 in acd, p53 double mutant embryos. To our best of knowledge, this is the first study revealing detailed transcriptomic alterations, reflecting novel p53-dependent and -independent pathways contributing to the acd phenotype. Our data confirm the importance of cell cycle and DNA repair pathways, and suggest novel links between telomere dysfunction and immune system regulation and the splicing machinery. Given the broad applicability of telomere maintenance in growth, development, and genome stability, our data will also provide a rich resource for others studying telomere maintenance and DNA damage responses in mammalian model systems.

AB Lung cancer remains one of the most aggressive human malignancies with a low survival rate. Hyperoside (quercetin 3-O-beta-D-galactopyranoside) is a flavonol glycoside with an anti-cancer activity. The microRNA-let-7 was widely regarded as a tumor suppressor in human tumors. Here, we investigated the role of hyperoside and let-7a-5p on the lung cancer cell proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis in A549 cells in vitro. Our results showed that hyperoside could inhibit the proliferation of A549 cells through inducing apoptosis and G1/S phase arrest. Let-7a-5p could inhibit the proliferation of A549 cells via inhibiting the process of G1/S phase. Additionally, hyperoside and let-7a-5p had a synergetic effect on suppressing the proliferation of A549 cells; microRNA-let-7a-5p directly regulated the expression of CCND1 in A549 cells. Our study illustrated that hyperoside and microRNA-let7a-5p might provide a synergistic effect on anti-cancer, which may provide a new idea for lung cancer treatment.

AB Background The relationship between vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene variant rs699947 polymorphism and urologic neoplasms risk was studied extensively in recent years. The VEGF gene plays a key role in angiogenesis of urologic neoplasms, but some conclusions are still inconclusive. The aim of this study was to determine whether this polymorphism is a risk factor for susceptibility to urologic neoplasms by conducting a meta-analysis.
   Methods: We performed a meta-analysis of 15 different publications from the PubMed, Embase and Medline databases, to better assess the association between VEGF rs699947 polymorphism and urologic neoplasms risk. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were evaluated using random or fixed effects models.
   Results: By pooling all eligible studies, we found that the VEGF rs699947 polymorphism was not associated with overall urologic neoplasms. However, subgroup analysis based on cancer types demonstrated that significantly increased association was found between VEGF rs699947 polymorphism and the risk of bladder cancer (BCa) under heterozygous genetic model (OR = 1.48, 95%CI = 1.17-1.89). And rs699947 polymorphism was also identified an increased risk of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) under dominant, recessive, homozygous, heterozygous and allelic contrast genetic models, while no association was observed in prostate cancer (PCa). In addition, in subgroup analysis by ethnicity, we found rs699947 polymorphism was associated with Asian population under dominant, homozygous, heterozygous and allelic contrast genetic models. No evidence of publication bias was found (Begg's test, P = 0.855; Egger's test, P = 0.590).
   Conclusions: In summary, our study showed evidence that the VEGF rs699947 polymorphism was obviously associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer and renal cell carcinoma, particularly in Asian population, while no significant association was observed in overall urologic neoplasms. Future studies with larger sample sizes are warranted to further evaluate these associations in more details.

AB Alterations in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) contribute to the pathogenesis of intracranial aneurysms (IAs), but the molecular mechanisms of these alterations are unclear. The aim of this study was therefore to identify the molecular mechanism of VSMC-mediated IAs at clinical and cellular levels. We used bioinformatic and biochemical analyses to show that the microRNA (miR)-143/145 cluster was involved in various biological processes related to aneurysm formation. Clinical studies showed that the miR-143/145 cluster was downregulated in IA patients when compared with healthy subjects. However, KLF5 expression was upregulated in IA patients. In vitro experiments showed that overexpression of the miR-143/145 cluster inhibited proliferation and migration of VSMCs, but increased contractile protein expression and decreased matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -3. KLF5 overexpression had the opposite effect, even reversing the protective effect of the miR-143/145 cluster on lAs. Bifluorescein report experiments further confirmed that both miR-143 and miR-145 interacted with the 3'-UTR of KLF5 and inhibited post-transcriptional expression of KLF5. Taken together, the results showed that VSMC phenotypic modulation with upregulation of KLF5 by downregulation of the miR-143/145 cluster played an important role in formation and growth of IAs. The process of IA formation was reversed by overexpression of the miR-143/145 cluster. Together, the results provided a theoretical basis for further investigation of the potential clinical prevention and treatment of IAs.

AB MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play key roles in the stress response in animals. The rainbow trout is a widely cultivated cold-water fish species that usually encounters heat stress, which affects its growth and may cause diseases. However, there is limited information on the miRNAs involved in heat stress in this species. To identify the heat-responsive miRNAs at the genome level in rainbow trout, we conducted high-throughput sequencing of 6 small RNA libraries from the liver tissues of rainbow trout specimens under control and heat-treated conditions. A total of 363 conserved miRNAs and 638 novel miRNAs were identified, among which 39 (21 conserved and 18 novel) miRNAs were differentially expressed in response to heat stress. Eight important miRNAs were further validated using quantitative real-time PCR. GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analyses of the potential target genes of the DE miRNAs, revealed DNA replication and protein folding and unfolding were affected by heat stress. Several key pathways involved in the heat stress response were characterized, such as protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, and progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation. In addition, 20 important functional interaction pairs among the 65 negatively correlated miRNA-mRNA pairs were identified using integrated miRNA-mRNA analysis and miRNA prediction algorithms, which including potential important miRNAs and target genes such as miR-301a, miR-301d, let-7c, novel_1181 and HSP90BA, HSP90BB, HSP40, PDIA3. This study showed that the identified miRNAs probably play important roles in the heat stress response and lay a foundation for further studies on the thermal adaptation mechanisms in rainbow trout.

AB Background: Angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) gene 1166A > C polymorphism is strongly associated with the incidence of cardiovascular diseases and predicts the development of metabolic syndrome (MetS). There is little information about the gene-diet interactions associated with MetS. This investigation examined the interaction between dietary patterns and AT1R polymorphism in relation to development risk of MetS.
   Methods: A prospective, non-interventional, case-control study included 265 MetS patients and 262 healthy controls in an adult population from Croatia. Collected data included clinical variables, type of diet (Mediterranean, continental and mixed), biochemical tests and AT1R genotyping. AT1R 1166A > C genotyping was performed by PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism methods. To examine gene-diet interactions, a total predictive model was built using a hierarchical backward elimination approach.
   Results: Participants on Continental-diet were nearly 20 times more likely to have MetS than those on Mediterranean or mixed diet (OR = 19.96; 95% CI 10.44-38.18). In multivariate prediction, control subjects with AT1R 1166AC or CC genotype had a higher risk for high triglycerides compared to the AA genotype carriers. 1166AC or CC genotype carriers more often chose Mediterranean or mixed-diet versus 1166AA genotype carriers whose choice often was continental diet.
   Conclusions: Our results are the first to suggest the possibility that the choice of diet can undermine the potential genetic risk of the AT1R polymorphism as polymorphism carriers may spontaneously choose the Mediterranean-diet.

AB Catenin beta 1 (CTNNB1, also known as beta-catenin), is a key gene involved in wnt-beta-catenin signaling pathway and plays a significant role in animal reproduction. The aim of this study was to explore the expression profiles and different splice variants of the cashmere goat CTNNB1 gene in testis, as well as to find novel insertion/deletion mutations (indels) and to further evaluate their association with litter size in Shaanbei white cashmere (SBWC) goats (n = 850) using Inner Mongolia white cashmere (IMWC) goats as a control group (n = 311). In this study, the CTNNB1 mRNA was detectable in all tissues, and in testis its expression was significantly lower than kidney, heart and so on. Meanwhile, four transcript variants, named by Ctnnb1-A/-B/-C/-D, were identified for the first time in SBWC goats, and Ctnnb1-C had the highest expression in testis, indicating that it plays an effective role in male fertility. Furthermore, a novel 26-bp indel was found within the CTNNB1 gene in both SBWC and IMWC breeds. A Chi-square test (chi(2)-test) showed that the difference between the high-fecundity group (SBWC) and the low-fertility group (IMWC) was extremely significant (P = 1.09E-10). Only one insertion/ deletion (ID) genotype in IMWC goats which was unable to perform association analysis. In association analysis, the 26-bp indel was significantly associated with the first-born litter size in SBWC female goats (P = 0.026), and the individuals with ID genotype (n = 96) significantly had more lambs than those with insertion/insertion (II) genotype (n = 611) (P = 0.019). These findings revealed that the alternative splicing was involved in the regulation of CTNNB1 expression and the 26-bp indel could be utilized as a candidate marker for marker-assisted selection (MAS) in cashmere goat industry.

SO GENE

ID DEMETHYLASE; DIFFERENTIATION; MUTATIONS
AB Histone lysine methylation influences processes such as gene expression and DNA repair. Thirty Jumonji C (JmjC) domain-containing proteins have been identified and phylogenetically clustered into seven subfamilies. Most JmjC domain-containing proteins have been shown to possess histone demethylase activity toward specific histone methylation marks. One of these subfamilies, the KDM5 family, is characterized by five conserved domains and includes four members. Interestingly, de novo loss-of-function and missense variants in KDM5B were identified in patients with intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) but also in unaffected individuals. Here, we report two novel de novo splice variants in the KDM5B gene in three patients with ID and ASD. The c.808 + 1G > A variant was identified in a boy with mild ID and autism traits and is associated with a significant reduced KDM5B mRNA expression without alteration of its H3K4me3 pattern. In contrast, the c.576 + 2T > C variant was found in twins with global delay in developmental milestones, poor language and ASD. This variant causes the production of an abnormal transcript which may produce an altered protein with the loss of the ARID1B domain with an increase in global gene H3K4me3. Our data reinforces the recent observation that the KDM5B haploinsufficiency is not a mechanism involved in intellectual disability and that KDM5B disorder associated with LOF variants is a recessive disorder. However, some variants may also cause gain of function, and need to be interpreted with caution, and functional studies should be performed to identify the molecular consequences of these different rare variants.

AB Obesity is a major risk for hypertension. However, the associations between hypertension susceptibility loci and the risk of obesity as well as the effects of gene-gene interactions are unclear, especially in the Chinese children population. Six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (ATP2B1 rs17249754, CSK rs1378942, MTHFR rs1801133, CYPI7A1 rs1004467, STK39 rs3754777, FGF5 rs16998073) were genotyped for 3503 Chinese children, aged 6-18 years. Of them, 758 obese cases and 2745 controls were identified based on the International Obesity Task Force age- and sex-specific BMI references. Among the six SNPs, three were associated with obesity risk (CSK rs1378942: odds ratio (OR) = 1.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-1.43, P = 0.042; MTHFR rs1801133: OR = 1.19, 95% CI 1.05-1.34, P = 0.006; FGF5 rs16998073: OR = 1.14, 95% CI 1.00-1.29, P = 0.047). The genetic risk score (GRS), based on these three SNPs (CSK rs1378942, MTHFR rs1801133, FGF5 rs16998073), showed a positive association with risk of obesity (OR = 1.18, 95% CI 1.09-1.28, P = 7.60 x 10(-5)). The same association signals were also detected in the subgroups of puberty and inactivity. In addition, interaction analyses among these loci implied a potential gene-gene interaction between MTHFR and FGF5. These findings show a significant association of hypertension susceptibility loci in Chinese children, suggesting a likely influence of genetic and environmental factors on the risk of obesity.

AB Because of the deep research about tumorigenesis mechanism, the cognition of cancer has been transferred to molecular level from morphology. Previous articles reported a potential connection between circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and prognosis of pancreatic cancer. A total of 18 related articles including 1243 patients were enrolled to access the relationship between cfDNA and prognosis of pancreatic cancer. The hazard ratio (HR) was used to combine the univariate and multivariate results of included studies. Our result performed that the cfDNA had significant prognostic value in predicting OS (HR = 2.41, 95%CI: 1.93-3.02, I-2 = 60%) and PFS (HR = 2.47, 95,/oCI: 1.80-3.40, I-2 = 0%) in univariate analysis. The multivariate analyses about OS (HR = 2.57, 95%CI: 1.95-3.38, I-2 = 66%) and PFS (HR = 2.31, 95%CI: 1.47-3.64, I-2 = 0%) also showed significance. In conclusion, the cfDNA was a significant prognostic factor for OS and PFS in patients with pancreatic cancer. The mutation (Kras, ERBB2-exonl7 and KrasG12V), circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) presence, hypermethylation and higher concentration of cfDNA were both associated with worse survival results in pancreatic cancer.

AB Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide and non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), a heterogeneous class of tumors, represents approximately 85% of all new lung cancer diagnosis. Conventional treatment options have limited efficacy because most cases are in the advanced stage at the time of diagnosis. The present study evaluates the anti-cancer activity of 1,2-diazole (pyrazole), a natural compound from mangrove plant Rhizophora apiculata (R.apiculata) on A549 lung carcinoma cells. In the present study the anti-cancer mechanism of pyrazole, was examined by the expression level of proteins Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and Cyclin-dependent kinase-2 (CDK-2) which are commonly associated with the cell signaling pathways that control cell survival and apoptosis, that could facilitate to develop a novel target and effective treatment approach for patients with NSCLC. Pyrazole significantly induced cell cycle arrest and initiated apoptosis through inhibition of downstream components of EGFR tyrosine kinase pathway. Pyrazole disrupts the mitochondrial membrane potential and modulated the protein levels of Bax and Bcl-2 which could probably lead to caspase-3 activation. Furthermore, Pyrazole suppresses the expression of CDK-2 resulting in cell cycle arrest at G1 phase and in the Gl-S phase transition. Taken together, the current study provides new insight in to the precise molecular mechanisms responsible for the anticancer activity of pyrazole in NSCLC, A549 cells. The study opens an avenue for development of a natural compound as a potential therapeutic agent which could target cell signaling pathways to combat human NSCLC.

AB Vertebrate genomes have been considered to have undergone a complicated evolution during their early period and to have generated a large number of genetic templates with novel functions, such as an extended spinal cord and a dorsal central nervous system. However, consistent gene evolution in vertebrate genomes has not been fully elucidated. In this study, we have systematically investigated the gene evolution in vertebrates utilizing a series of comparative genomics tools. We determined that three critical genes were consistently lost in vertebrate genomes, and 14 genes initially emerged in vertebrate formation. Furthermore, another 29 genes were identified with consistent amino acid variation between the vertebrates and invertebrates. A function analysis of five genes (TEP3, ABLIM2, ABLIM3, GAD1 and GAD2) was performed, and their evolution mechanisms in vertebrate genomes further investigated. These findings provide novel insights for studying the vertebrate evolution and spine development.

AB The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of a single bout and 8 weeks of downhill running versus uphill running exercise on expression of PGC1-alpha, FNDC5 and UCP1 in mice. Forty-eight BALB/c male mice weighing 25-30 g were randomly assigned into 8 groups: 1) acute downhill running (ADR) on a -15 degrees slope; 2) acute uphill running (AUR) on a +15 degrees slope; 3) acute running without inclination (AWI), 4) acute without exercise as control (ACtri), 5) chronic downhill running (CDR) on a -15 degrees slope; 6) chronic uphill running (CUR) on a + 15'slope; 7) chronic running without inclination (CWI), 8) chronic without exercise as control (CCtrl). Twenty four hours after the last training session, the mice were sacrificed and Calf muscles (including soleus and gastrocnemius) and quadriceps muscles (including Rectus femoris and vastus intermedius) were obtained and expression levels of PGC1-alpha and FNDC5 in crus and quadriceps muscles and UCP1 in visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissues were measured and compared between the groups. PGC-1 alpha and FNDC5 mRNA levels increased after treadmill exercise training in all acute and chronic exercise groups in both skeletal muscle groups. Furthermore mRNA level of UCP1 in subcutaneous adipose tissue but not in visceral adipose tissue increased both after acute and chronic exercise. Collectively, data showed that downhill running exercise to be more effective than other exercises, as downhill running has led to a greater improvement in metabolism may be considered more effective for browning of fat tissue.

AB Background Suicide is a fatal outcome for subjects with mental ill-health. Genetic factors and psychological correlates are believed to contribute to the risk of suicide attempts (SA), whereas both factors are reported to exert a small effect. This study therefore tried to investigate if combination of the two aspects can enhance the explanation of variance in SA.
   Methods: A common variant rs7713917 in HOMER1 gene was genotyped for 333 Chinese psychiatric patients with or without SA. Multifactorial risk models comprised of this variant and psychological correlates were identified by logistic regression analysis (LRA) and Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction (MDR) method separately, and then evaluated for their performance by biostatistical methods.
   Results: An association of A-carrier genotypes in rs7713917 with an increased risk of SA was observed (OR = 1.79, 95% CI = 1.08-2.98). Although with a medium effect size, this variant alone could only explain 1.9% variance of SA. Interestingly, this study was the first time to show that the association of the rs7713917 and SA was significantly mediated by the NEO conscientiousness (NEO-C) dimension (p-value = 0.002), with a greater genetic effect observed in subjects with a low NEO-C level (OR = 2.89, 95% CI = 1.16-7.18) but not in subjects with an average or high level. Upon the LRA method, the multifactorial risk model constituted of the two interacted factors and their interaction effect could explain up to 17.0% variance, which was almost 9-fold higher than the one explained by the rs7713917 alone. Furthermore, this model owned a higher effectiveness than the three models identified by the MDR method (p-value < 0.0007).
   Conclusions: The present study identified an effective multifactorial risk model, in which the combination of the HOMER1 variant and the NEO-C dimension could enhance explanation of the variance of SA in Chinese. This pilot study may provide a novel avenue to investigate the pathogenesis of SA in psychiatric patients.

AB By employing bioinformatics scanning approaches and luciferase reporter, our previous study showed that two less common human miRNAs, miR-875 and miR-3144, target a conserved site in the genomes of most high-risk human papillomaviruses (HR-HPVs). In this study, we found that the site targeted by miR-875 and miR-3144 overlapped with the 5' alternative splice site of E6E7 transcripts in HPV16. Using HPV16 + SiHa cells, we showed that high levels of miR-875 and miR-3144 reduced the abundance of unspliced E6, while they promoted three E6* spliced transcripts and decreased the expression levels of E6/E7 oncoproteins and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). A potential miR-875 target site was predicted in EGFR. Meanwhile, depletion of EGFR resulted in a failure to promote E6* but maintained the suppression of unspliced E6 driven by miR-875 and miR3144. The data suggest that these two miRNAs switch the E6/E6* ratio through both the EGFR pathway and direct targeting. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that human miRNAs regulate the HPV splice isoforms. Furthermore, miRNA-875 and miRNA-3144 are only found in vertebrates and Homo sapiens, and the binding site in EGFR is highly conserved in Boreoeutheria. Our findings highlight the tumour-suppressing effect of miRNAs that possibly appeared in the late stage of biological evolution.

AB We identified and investigated the prognostic value of secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1) in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients and evaluate the relationship between the SPP1 expression level and clinical characteristics. First, SPP1 was identified through four LUAD datasets in GEO database and validated by the TCGA database. Then a total of 149 lung adenocarcinoma patients were included, as well as their clinicopathological characteristics collected in the study. The expression levels of SPP1 and adjacent normal tissues were assessed by immunohistochemistry. The association between SPP1 and its prognostic value was systematically evaluated. Results showed high SPP1 level predicted poorer LUAD survival by univariate Cox analysis (P = 0.017), and the multivariate result was also significant (P = 0.021). Subgroup analysis suggested the prognostic value of SPP1 was significant in stage T1 (log rank P = 0.011), stage N0 (log rank P = 0.046) and stage N1 (log rank P = 0.009) patients. After including these markers into a nomogram, the Harrell's C-index of the nomogram was 0.694. In summary, our findings suggest that SPP1 is an independent biomarker with prognostic significance in LUAD.

AB Dead end (dnd) is a germ plasm component that plays an essential role for primordial germ cell (PGC) development in vertebrates. Previously, we have found that dnd is the first fish PGC specifier in medaka. Here, we present an additional evidence that dnd is the determinant for PGC specification in Oryzias celebensis. In adult tissues, the O. celebensis dnd (Ocdnd) RNA shows germ cells specific expression in gonads. In the testis, Ocdnd RNA is strongly detected in spermatogonia and meiotic cells and gradually decreases during the spermatogenesis. In the ovary, Ocdnd RNA is present throughout oogenesis. In the embryos, Ocdnd RNA is maternally provided and asymmetrically localized to prominent particles of presumptive PGCs before gastrulation stage and restricted to PGCs subsequently. In addition, Ocdnd 3' UTR can induce specific and stabilized GFP reporter expression in PGCs. Furthermore, knockdown of Ocdnd by morpholino (MO) injection abolishes the PGCs formation and this can be rescued by co-injection of medaka dnd (Oldnd) mRNA. More importantly, overexpression of Oldnd mRNA surprisingly boosts PGCs number. These results provide insights into function of dnd as a conserved specifier of PGCs in the genus Oryzias.

AB Interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) is a key transcription factor involved in the control of the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and immune responses to infection, and multiple polymorphisms of the IFR5 gene have been shown to be associated with autoimmune and infectious diseases. Several studies have investigated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a number of genes associated with the susceptibility to or severity and outcome of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), but no research has yet been conducted on the role of IRF5 gene polymorphisms in CAP. In this study, we investigated the effects of four IFR5 variants, rs77571059, rs2004640, rs10954213, and rs3807306 on the susceptibility to CAP by genotyping 228 CAP patients and 177 healthy donors. Our results indicated that IFR5 variants rs77571059 and rs2004640 and haplotype GTAA were associated with the susceptibility to CAP and rs77571059 was related to the severity of the disease, suggesting that IFR5 variants may contribute to the pathogenesis of CAP and may serve as prognostic markers of CAP susceptibility and outcome.

AB Increasing reports demonstrated that miRNAs play a critical role in tumor development and progression. Previous studies revealed that miR-1301 was abnormally expressed in various cancers. However, its function and underlying mechanism in osteosarcoma (OS) remains unknown. In this study, miR-1301 expression was significantly down-regulated in both OS tissues and cell lines. Down-regulated miR-1301 was obviously associated with malignant clinical features and poor overall survival of OS patients. miR-1301 overexpression inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion. In addition, we identified BCL9 act as a direct target of miR-1301 by directly binding to its 3'-UTR. In clinical OS tissues, miR-1301 negatively correlated BCL9 expression. BCL9 was up-regulated in OS tissues and cells. BCL9 overexpression promoted OS progression. Moreover, restoration of BCL9 expression at least partially abolished the proliferation, migration and invasion of miR-1301 on OS cells. In conclusion, our data indicated that miR-1301 inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion of OS by targeting BCL9, and may represent a novel potential therapeutic target and prognostic marker for OS.

   IDENTIFICATION
AB Long non-coding RNAs (IncRNAs) have emerged as critical regulators in a variety of diseases, including many tumors, such as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the function and mechanisms responsible for these molecules in HCC are not thoroughly understood. In our previous study, we found that LINC00052 was acted as a tumor suppressor in HCC. In this study, we performed transcription microarray analysis to investigate the target gene of LINC00052, and found that knockdown of LINC00052 significantly increased the expression of SRY-related HMG-box gene 9 (SOX9), which plays an oncogenic role in HCC. Moreover, luciferase reporter assay revealed that LINC00052 promoted miR-101-3p expression by enhancing its promoter activity. In addition, online database analysis tools and luciferase assays showed that miR-101-3p could target SOX9. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) demonstrated that miR-101-3p was downregulated in HCC tissues and HCC cell lines. And we found a positive relationship between LINC00052 and miR-101-3p, and a negative relationship between miR-101-3p and SOX9 in HCC tissues. Besides, miR-101-3p was involved in LINC00052 inhibits HCC cells proliferation and metastasis. At the molecular level, LINC00052 downgulated SOX9 to inhibit HCC cells proliferation and metastasis by interacting with miR-101-3p. It might be a potential application for HCC therapy.

AB The TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion were frequently found in prostate cancer, and thought to play some fundamental mechanisms for the development of prostate cancer. However, until now, the clinical and prognostic significance of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion was not fully understood. In this study, based on the 281 prostate cancers that constructed from a historical watchful waiting cohort, the statistically significant associations between TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion and clinicopathologic characteristics were identified. In addition, the Elastic Net algorithm was used to predict the patients with TMPRSS2-ERG fusion status, and good predictive results were obtained, indicating that this algorithm was suitable to this prediction problem. The differential gene network was constructed from the network, and the KEGG enrichment analysis demonstrated that the module genes were significantly enriched in several important pathways.

AB Introduction: Congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis (CIPA) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder resulting from NTRK1 mutation. Over 105 NTRK1 mutations have been reported in CIPA patients worldwide. The causative NTRK1 mutations lead to loss of function of the TrkA protein, an important ligand for nerve growth factor (NGF), and therefore induce various clinical phenotypes associated with neuron maturation defects.
   Materials and methods: Three patients from unrelated families with CIPA were subjected to detailed clinical examinations. Blood samples were collected from all the patients and their available family members, as well as 200 healthy volunteers. Sanger sequencing for all the exons and splicing sites of NTRK1 was performed on all samples. The phenotype-genotype relationship and genetic epidemiology of Chinese CIPA patients were also analysed.
   Results: A total of four different NTRK1 mutations [c.851-33T > A, c.44G > A (p.Trp15*), c.287 + 2dupT, c.1549G > C (p.G1y517Arg)1 were identified in these families, and c.1549G > C (p.Gly51-7Arg) was a novel mutation that had not been reported previously. The 'mild' manifestations observed in patients with c.85133T > A indicated this mutation as a 'mild' mutation. After reviewing studies reporting mutations in Chinese CIPA patients, we speculate the mutation c.851-33T > A is one of the founder mutations in the Chinese population.
   Conclusions: Our research expanded the spectrum of the NTRK1 mutations associated with CIPA patients, provided additional clues relating to the phenotype-genotype relationship in CIPA, and summarized the features of the genetic epidemiology of CIPA in the Chinese ethnic group.

AB Similar to the role of juvenile hormone (JH) in insects, methyl farnesoate (MF), the unepoxidized form of JH III, regulates many developmental processes in crustaceans, such as molting and reproduction. We have previously showed that the JH receptor, Methoprene-tolerant (Met), which is also a candidate receptor for MF, might be involved in the MF-mediated vitellogenesis in the swimming crab Portunus trituberculatus. In this study, the role of Kruppel homolog 1 (Kr-h1), a transcription factor downstream Met in JH signaling, was further investigated. The deduced protein of Pt-Kr-h1 contained seven repeats of zinc finger motifs, similar to Kr-h1s from other crustacean species, but differing from the eight zinc finger motifs found in insect Kr-h1s. MF treatment in vitro induced the expression of Pt-Kr-h1 in hepatopancreas but not ovary, which is similar to the MF-responsive pattern of Pt-Met as previously reported. Moreover, the expression of Pt-Kr-h1 decreased significantly after treating with Pt-Met dsRNA, strongly indicating that the Pt-Kr-h1 might be involved in the Met-mediated MF signaling pathway. RNAi of Pt-Met and Pt-Kr-h1 both led to a decrease in vitellogenin (Vg) expression, and the reduction cannot be rescued by adding MF, suggesting the regulation of vitellogenesis by MF may act through Met and Kr-h1. These results would help to enhance the current understanding of the regulatory mechanism of MF signaling, and provide a vital resource for further research into the evolution of hormonal pathways in arthropods.

AB A cryptic plasmid pHIG22 from Therms scotoductus sp. K6, an isolate from the Alangullu Hot Spring (Aydin, Turkey), was sequenced and characterized. The pHIG22 plasmid is a multicopy, double stranded and 2222 bp circular molecule with 62.78% GC content, which shows a characteristical nucleotide sequence without any homology to other known plasmids.
   Five open reading frames were predicted based on the nucleotide sequence analysis. The deduced amino acid sequence of all predicted ORFs didn't show any similarity with any known proteins. Three palindroms were detected and two promoter sequences were predicted in both strands. With electron microscopy (TEM) analysis, the replication intermediates were seen as typical Q-shaped molecules that committing pHIG22 replicates via the Theta replication mechanism. A 2012 bp region among 387 and 614 bp of pHIG22 was determined as minimal replicon which carries the elements necessary for plasmid replication and on region. Furthermore, quantitative real-time PCR showed that the relative copy number of pHIG22 was estimated to be 148.2 +/- 4.7 copies per chromosome equivalent. The new Theta type plasmid would be useful and beneficial to build vectors for cloning of thermophilic genes and in vivo protein engineering.

AB Bladder cancer (BC) has been regarded as the most common malignancy of the urinary system worldwide. With lack of investigations for molecular pathogenesis underlying that develop BC, the therapeutic efficacy of several therapeutic approaches existing is still unsatisfactory. Here, our study aimed to explore the potentially biological function of MAN1B1 on BC. In this study, MAN1B1 expression level in BC tissues and normal tissues was analyzed based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data and correlation between its expression and prognosis was determined using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Knockout of MAN1B1 was performed using silencing RNA and the efficacy of MAN1B1 knockout was identified using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis. The BC cells proliferation was assessed by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) assay, and then the cells apoptosis was detected by Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (Annexin V-FITC)/propidium iodide (PI) staining and flow cytometry following MAN1B1 knocked down by small interfering RNA. Protein kinase B (AKT) signaling was evaluated by detecting related markers, namely AKT, p-AKT, 4E-BP-1 and Bax using western blot assay. As a result, the MAN1B1 expression was higher in BC tissues than those in normal tissues, besides, its overexpression was associated with poor prognosis. Moreover, MAN1B1 reduction by silencing RNA approach resulted in BC cells proliferation suppression and BC cells apoptosis promotion. Finally, AKT signaling activity was inhibited by MAN1B1 silencing. Taken together, these results unraveled that MAN1B1 may act on an oncogenic action in BC, which improved the likelihood of MAN1B1 taking on a promising prognostic biomarker and a potential target for treating BC.

AB RON receptor tyrosine kinase is a transmembrane protein directly involved in suppression of inflammation and its aberrant expression linked to cancers and metastasis. Efforts to block deregulated RON signaling in tumors using small molecule kinase inhibitors or antibodies have been complicated by the presence of unknown number/types of isoforms of RON, which, despite being structurally similar, localize differently and mediate varied functions. Current study was designed to identify the splice variants of RON transcripts formed by skipping of sequences between exons 9 and 14 for better understanding of isoform specific RON signaling in cancers. PCR amplification and bi-directional sequencing of a 901 bp cDNA sequence located between exons 9 to 14 of RON from lung cancer cell lines revealed the presence of two splicing variants formed by skipping of exons 11 and 11-13. Each of these transcripts was found in more than one cell line. Expressed sequence tag (EST) database search indicated that the splicing variant lacking exons 11-13 was a novel one. Here we conclude that the splice variants of RON lacking exon 11 and exons 11-13 were detected in several lung cancer cell lines. Novel variant formed by skipping exons 11-13, the sequence of which code for transmembrane region, is predicted to code for a truncated isoform that may be secreted out. Tumors may antagonize the ligand dependent anti-inflammatory function of wild-type RON by secreting out the ligand binding isoforms.

AB In recent years DNA microarray technology, leading to the generation of high-volume biological data, has gained significant attention. To analyze this high volume gene-expression data, one such powerful tool is Clustering. For any clustering algorithm, its efficiency majorly depends upon the underlying similarity/dissimilarity measure. During the analysis of such data often there is a need to further explore the similarity of genes not only with respect to their expression values but also with respect to their functional annotations, which can be obtained from Gene Ontology (GO) databases. In the existing literature, several novel clustering and bi-clustering approaches were proposed to identify co-regulated genes from gene-expression datasets. Identifying co-regulated genes from gene expression data misses some important biological information about functionalities of genes, which is necessary to identify semantically related genes. In this paper, we have proposed sixteen different semantic gene-gene dissimilarity measures utilizing biological information of genes retrieved from a global biological database namely Gene Ontology (GO). Four proximity measures, viz. Euclidean, Cosine, point symmetry and line symmetry are utilized along with four different representations of gene-GO-term annotation vectors to develop total sixteen gene-gene dissimilarity measures. In order to illustrate the profitability of developed dissimilarity measures, some multi-objective as well as single-objective clustering algorithms are applied utilizing proposed measures to identify functionally similar genes from Mouse genome and Yeast datasets. Furthermore, we have compared the performance of our proposed sixteen dissimilarity measures with three existing state-of-the-art semantic similarity and distance measures.

AB Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (OTCD) is an X-linked urea cycle disorder affecting both males and females. Hemizygous males commonly present with severe hyperammonemic encephalopathy during the neonatal period. Heterozygous females have great phenotypic variability. The majority of female patients can manifest later in life or have unrecognized symptoms, making the diagnosis of OTCD in females very challenging. Here we report on three unrelated Thai female cases with OTCD presenting with different manifestations including aggressive behavior, acute liver failure and severe encephalopathy. Whole exome sequencing successfully identified disease-causing mutations in all three cases including two novel ones: the c.209_210delAA (p.Lys70Argfs*17) and the c.850T > A (p.Tyr284Asn). This study affirms variable symptoms in female patients with OTCD and emphasizes the importance of early recognition and prompt management for favorable outcomes. In addition, identification of two novel causative variants expands the genotypic spectrum of OTC.

AB Vitamin D binding protein (VDBP) plays an important role in the immune modulation and pathogenesis of hepatitis C viral (HCV) infection by influencing serum vitamin D levels. The present study aims to evaluate the association of VDBP genetic polymorphisms with susceptibility to and chronicity of HCV infection in a high-risk Chinese population. Seven genetic variants in the VDBP gene were genotyped in a case-control study of 886 patients with HCV persistent infection, 539 subjects with spontaneous clearance, and 1081 uninfected controls. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the effects of these variants on HCV infection outcomes. The results showed that two variants rs7041-G and rs3733359-T alleles were significantly associated with increased susceptibility of HCV infection, and the combined effect of the two unfavorable alleles was related to an elevated risk of HCV infection in a locus-dosage manner (P-trend = 8.16 x 10(-4)). Interaction analysis manifested that rs7041-GT/GG and rs3733359-CT/TT jointly increased risk of HCV infection. Moreover, haplotype analysis suggested that compared with the most frequent TC haplotype, the haplotype carrying GT indicated a risk effect of HCV infection [odds ratio (OR) = 1.464]. However, no significant associations were observed for the other five variants. These findings implied that VDBP rs7041-G and rs3733359-T variants may contribute to increased susceptibility to HCV infection in a high-risk Chinese population.

   model; Sequence labeling
AB State-of-the-art models for joint entity recognition and relation extraction strongly rely on external natural language processing (NLP) tools such as POS (part-of-speech) taggers and dependency parsers. Thus, the performance of such joint models depends on the quality of the features obtained from these NLP tools. However, these features are not always accurate for various languages and contexts. In this paper, we propose a joint neural model which performs entity recognition and relation extraction simultaneously, without the need of any manually extracted features or the use of any external tool. Specifically, we model the entity recognition task using a CRF (Conditional Random Fields) layer and the relation extraction task as a multi-head selection problem (i.e., potentially identify multiple relations for each entity). We present an extensive experimental setup, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using datasets from various contexts (i.e., news, biomedical, real estate) and languages (i.e., English, Dutch). Our model outperforms the previous neural models that use automatically extracted features, while it performs within a reasonable margin of feature-based neural models, or even beats them.

ID OPERATION
AB Privacy preserving data mining has been a major research subject in recent years. The most important goal of this area is to protect personal information and prevent disclosure of this information during the data mining process. There are various techniques in the field of privacy preserving data mining. One of these techniques is association rules mining. The main purpose of association rules mining is to hide sensitive association rules. So far, various algorithms have been presented to this field in order to reach the purpose of sensitive association rules hiding. Each algorithm has its own specific functions and methods. To hide sensitive association rules, this paper presents an electromagnetic field optimization algorithm (EFO4ARH). This algorithm utilizes the data distortion technique to hide the sensitive association rules. In this algorithm, two fitness functions are used to reach the solution with the least side effects. Also, in this algorithm, the runtime has been reduced. This algorithm consists of a technique for exiting from local optima point and moving toward global optimal points. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated by doing experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets. Compared to four reference algorithms, the proposed algorithm shows a reduction in the side effects and better preservation of data quality. The performance of EFO4ARH is tested by standard deviation and mean Friedman ranks of error for standard functions (CEC benchmarks). In addition, hiding experiments show that our proposed algorithm outperforms existing hiding algorithms. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The bat algorithm (BA) has been shown to be effective to solve a wider range of optimization problems. However, there is not much theoretical analysis concerning its convergence and stability. In order to prove the convergence of the bat algorithm, we have built a Markov model for the algorithm and proved that the state sequence of the bat population forms a finite homogeneous Markov chain, satisfying the global convergence criteria. Then, we prove that the bat algorithm can have global convergence. In addition, in order to enhance the convergence performance of the algorithm and to identify the possible effect of parameter settings on convergence, we have designed an updated model in terms of a dynamic matrix. Subsequently, we have used the stability theory of discrete-time dynamical systems to obtain the stable parameter ranges for the algorithm.

AB There is a rising need for automated analysis of news text, and topic models have proven to be useful tools for this task. However, as the quality of the topics induced by topic models greatly varies, much research effort has been devoted to their automated evaluation. Recent research has focused on topic coherence as a measure of a topic's quality. Existing topic coherence measures work by considering the semantic similarity of topic words. This makes them unfit to detect the coherence of transient topics with semantically unrelated topic words, which abound in news media texts. In this paper, we introduce the notion of document-based topic coherence and propose novel topic coherence measures that estimate topic coherence based on topic documents rather than topic words. We evaluate the proposed measures on two datasets containing topics manually labeled for document-based coherence, on which the proposed measures outperform a strong baseline as well as word-based coherence measures. We also demonstrate the usefulness of document-based coherence measures for automated topic discovery from news media texts. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB As one of the most important research branches of evolutionary computation (EC), learning classifier system (LCS) is dedicated to discover decision making classifiers ("IF-THEN" type rules) via evolution and learning. Recent advances in LCS have shown distinguished generalization property over traditional approaches. In this paper, a novel LCS named niching genetic network programming with rule accumulation (nGNP-RA) is proposed. The unique features of the proposal arise from the following three points: First, it utilizes an advanced graph-based EC named GNP as the rule generator, resulting higher knowledge representation ability than traditional genetic algorithm (GA)-based LCSs; Second, a novel niching mechanism is developed in GNP to encourage the discovery of high-quality diverse rules; Third, a novel reinforcement learning (RL)-based mechanism is embedded to assign accurate credits to the discovered rules. To verify the effectiveness and robustness of nGNP-RA over traditional systems, two decision making testbeds are applied, including the benchmark tileworld problem and the real mobile robot control application.

AB In this paper, an extension and an application to the green procurement model based on Coloured Petri Nets is presented. The large number of services and providers for services that can exist in a company means a problem when it comes to managing purchases and much more if the purchases. If the purchases have a benefit such as the sustainability of the companies processes that provide the service, the problem is even greater. This paper aims to develop an extension for this proposed model using the petri nets tools thanks to its ease of modeling complex systems. Likewise, a new algorithm applied to the place of selection of suppliers and a methodical mathematical formalization was developed. Finally, two examples are implemented. The first example allows understanding and applying the model in a simple way. In the second example or study case, be proposed an application in a services company. This example describes the step by step of the evolution of the model and the results obtained by each stage. The application of the final example shows the qualitative advantages of the developed model and the need to apply some technique of quantitative analysis of easy integration to the model that will be defining in a future research.

AB Starting from a few labelled data examples as the seeds, rare category exploration (RCE) aims to find out the target rare category hidden in the given dataset. However, the performance of conventional RCE approaches is very sensitive to noisy labels while the presence of noises in manually generated labels is almost inevitable. To address this deficiency of traditional RCE approaches, this paper investigates the RCE process in the presence of noisy labels, which to the best of our knowledge has not yet been intensively studied by previous research. Based on the assumption that only one labelled data example of the rare category is correctly labelled while the other few data examples may be wrongly labelled, we first propose a label propagation based algorithm SLP to extract the coarse shape of a rare category. Then, we refine the result by proposing a mixture-information based propagation model, RLP. Extensive experiments have been conducted on six real-world datasets, which show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art RCE approaches. We also show that even with 20% noisy labels, our method is able to achieve a satisfactory accuracy. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID ALTERNATIVE TOLERANCE; OPTIMIZATION METHOD; 2-PHASE APPROACH; MODEL
AB In recent years, multiple objective decision making (MODM) has become more and more important, and multiple objective linear programming (MOLP) approaches have been widely used for solving MODM problems. Three popular fuzzy mathematical programming approaches, including maxmin, arithmetical average, and two-phase methods, are often employed to solve MOLP problems. However, maxmin and two-phase methods cannot obtain an efficient solution. Ideal and anti-ideal solutions are required in all traditional methods. Such solutions cannot easily be established as a model for a knowledge-based system or expert system. In order to enrich the body of knowledge related to the field of MOLP, a new multi-choice goal programming (MCGP) model is proposed to solve fuzzy MOLP (FMOLP) problems in which the ideal and anti-ideal solutions are no longer required. This reduces the complexity of the solution process for solving MODM. The original feasible region can be expended to a potential feasible region to determine the appropriate aspiration level for decision makers. The proposed methods can systematically solve MODM problem to obtain satisfactory solutions in one step. Thus, a model-based can easily be established for expert systems, knowledge-based system, and artificial intelligence systems. In addition, a revised utility function (UF) is derived to solve qualitative and quantitative MODM problems. Based on illustrative examples, the five methods (maxmin, arithmetical average, two-phase, goal programming (GP), and proposed models) are compared to reveal managerial implications. On the basis of these comparisons, DMs can easily determine the best suited solution for their specific MODM problems. Finally, a realistic example is provided to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed methods. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Active learning, which focuses on building an accurate prediction model with a reduced cost by actively querying which instances should be labeled for training, has been successfully employed in several real-world applications involving expensive labeling costs. Although most existing active learning strategies have focused on labeling unlabeled instances, it has been shown that improving the quality of previously annotated labels is also important when the annotator produces noisy labels. In this study, we propose a novel active learning framework for regression, which is effective for the scenarios with noisy annotators, by providing a new sampling strategy named exploration-refinement (ER) sampling. The ER sampling performs two main steps: exploration and refinement. The exploration step involves finding unlabeled instances to be labeled, and the refinement step seeks to improve the accuracy of already labeled instances. The experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the ER sampling with statistical significance. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The application of exosomes as a therapeutic reagent or drug delivery vehicle can be expanded by developing a method to preserve exosomes. Although exosomes are generally stored at - 80 degrees C, this temperature is not suitable for their handling or transportation and, therefore, other storage methods are desirable. Lyophilization is a promising storage method that can be used to preserve various substances at room temperature. In this study, we sought to develop a room temperature preservation method for exosomes using lyophilization and compared the properties of the lyophilized exosomes with ones stored at - 80 degrees C. Lyophilization without cryoprotectant resulted in the aggregation of B16BL6 melanoma-derived exosomes, while the addition of trehalose, a cryoprotectant, prevented aggregation during lyophilization. PAGE analysis revealed that the proteins and RNA of exosomes were protected following lyophilization in the presence of trehalose. Lyophilization had little effect on the pharmacokinetics of Gaussia luciferase (gLuc)-labeled exosomes after an intravenous injection into mice. Moreover, it was found that lyophilized exosomes retained the activity of loaded gLuc and immunostimulatory CpG DNA for approximately 4 weeks even when stored at 25 degrees C. In conclusion, lyophilization with trehalose is an effective method for the storage of exosomes for various applications.

AB Introduction: The global biologics market has been ever increasing over the last decades and is predicted to top Euro 350 by 2020. Facing this scenario, the parenteral route of biologics administration as hitherto standard route is inconvenient for the future. Among the alternatives, the intranasal delivery of therapeutic biologicals seems to be most promising but researchers are still facing challenges as indicated by the scarce number of successfully marketed peptide drugs.
   Areas covered: This review article is a compilation of current research focusing on achievements in the field of auxiliary agents for biologics delivery. First, the key benefits of the nose as most promising alternative route of drug administration are highlighted.
   Then, the potential of the different auxiliary agents in preclinical research is in detail discussed. Moreover, the most used permeation enhancing agents, mucolytic agents, mucoadhesive agents, in situ gelling agents and enzyme inhibiting agents in the formulation of nasal drug delivery systems are described.
   Thus, the overall purpose of this review is to highlight recent achievements in nasal delivery of biologics and to encourage researchers to work in the direction of needle-free nasal administration of biologics.
   Expert opinion: The nasal epithelium is a promising route for biologics administration, which is reflected in a number of well-established products on the market treating chronic diseases as well as a large number of clinical trials currently in progress. The nasal route of drug administration might be a chance to improve therapy of biologics however break-through advances, especially for very complex molecules, such as antibodies, are still needed.

AB The aim of this study is to investigate the potential of D-alpha-tocopheryl poly (ethylene glycol 1000) succinate (TPGS) modified nanoliposomes as an ophthalmic delivery system of brinzolamide (Brz) for glaucoma treatment. The Brz loaded nanoliposomes containing TPGS (T-LPs/Brz) were firstly developed by a thin-film dispersion method. The average particle size was 96.87 +/- 4.43 nm. The entrapment efficiency of the Brz was 95.41 +/- 3.03% and the drug loading was 4.00 +/- 0.13%. T-LPs/Brz exhibited obvious sustained release of Brz; in stark contrast to the normal liposomes of Brz (LPs/Brz) and the commercial formulation AZOPT (R) (Brz ophthalmic suspension, Brz-Sus). Enhanced trans-corneal transport of Brz was achieved with T-LPs/Brz. Compared with both Brz-Sus and LPs/Brz, the apparent permeability coefficient (P-app) of T-LPs/Brz was 10.2 folds and 1.38 folds higher, respectively. Moreover, T-LPs/Brz extended the cornea residence of Brz. White New Zealand rabbits treated with T-LPs/Brz had 3.18 folds and 1.57 folds Brz concentration 2 h after treatment than Brz-Sus and LPs/Brz, respectively. Further pharmacodynamic studies showed that T-LPs/Brz maintained an effective intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction from 3 h to 11 h after administration, while Brz-Sus and LPs/Brz presented effective IOP decreases from 3 h to 6 h and 3 h to 8 h respectively. The preliminary safety evaluation demonstrated that T-LPs/Brz had no significant side effects; specifically, no cornea damage and eye irritation. All the results indicated that TPGS modified nanoliposomes were a promising ocular delivery carriers for Brz to treat glaucoma. As such, T-LPs/Brz might be worthy of further translational study.

AB Anti-tumor drug/stent combinations play a dual role of stent and local chemotherapy to cancer. Herein, a series of paclitaxel (PTX) loaded polylactic acid (PLA) stent films were studied on drug release characteristics and in vivo antitumor effects. The film was implanted beneath and released drug towards the subcutaneous PC-3 tumor xenograft in mice, which consisted of a PTX-loaded layer and a drug-free backing layer. The concentrations of PTX were 10(3)-10(4) times higher than those in normal 20 tissue or organs in 26 days after implantation of the 50% PTX/20% PEG-loaded film, indicating an extreme accumulation of PTX in tumor tissue. The tumor volumes kept unchanged for the initial 10 days after implantation of the PTX-loaded films and then increased slightly, implying tumor growth was remarkably inhibited. Moreover, the results showed that the drug release can be effectively modulated by addition of PEG in the drug-loaded layer, present an unidirectional way by adding a backing layer, and the drug films could arrest PC-3 prostate cancer cells in G2/M phase and induce apoptosis after 300 days of drug release. With the advantages of prolonged drug release and long-term effectiveness, the films have great potential for anti-tumor treatment by local administration.

AB In a passive dry powder inhaler (DPI) a patient inhales to entrain drug powder. The goal of this study is to demonstrate experimentally that an Eulerian-Eulerian (EE CFD) computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method can accurately predict the entrainment of the dry powder formulation in DPIs. A CFD method that makes accurate predictions of the entrainment process can be applied in DPI design and optimization processes. Three different DPI entrainment geometries were tested. For each geometry, a transparent entrainment module was prepared. In each experiment, the chosen entrainment module was first filled with lactose powder and attached to an inhalation simulator (a computer controlled pump). The entrainment process was recorded with a highspeed camera. The resulting video footage was analysed and compared with CFD predictions. The observed distribution of powder in the entrainment compartment and the measured rate of drug entrainment were in good agreement with CFD predictions. Through a process of experimental validation, this study established the first demonstration that two-dimensional EE CFD methodology provides robust and accurate predictions of aerosol generation from DPI entrainment chambers. The findings support the wider application of EE CFD for the design optimization of DPI devices.

AB The aerodynamic performance of a dry powder for inhalation depends on the formulation and the dry powder inhaler (DPI). In the case of capsule-based DPIs, the capsule also plays a role in the powder aerosolisation and the dispersion of the micronized drug during the inhalation. This study evaluated the impact of gelatine capsules (Quali-G (TM) and Hard Gelatine Capsules for DPIs), cold-gelled hypromellose (HPMC) capsules (Quali-V (R)-I and Vcaps (R)) and thermal-gelled HPMC capsules (Vcaps (R) Plus) from Qualicaps (R) and Capsugel (R) respectively, on the delivered dose (DD), fine particle dose (FPD), and capsule retention for formoterol-lactose binary and ternary blends. This study used a low resistance Axahaler (R) DPI based on the RS01 design (Plastiape, Italy). Similar trends were observed with the different capsule types that packaged both dry powder formulations. The highest DD and FPD and the lowest formoterol capsule retention were observed with cold-gelled HPMC capsules such as Quali-V-I (R). and Vcaps (R), without significant differences between these capsules (p > 0.05, one-way ANOVA with Newman-Keuls post-hoc test) for both dry powders. Therefore, the capsule composition and manufacturing process have an influence on aerodynamic performance. In addition, the ternary blend showed higher DDs and FPDs but also higher capsule retention in comparison to the binary blend.

AB The objective of this work is to use phage display libraries as a screening tool to identify peptides that facilitate transport across the mucus barrier. Mucus is a complex selective barrier to particles and molecules, limiting penetration to the epithelial surface of mucosal tissues. In mucus-associated diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CF), mucus has increased visco elasticity and a higher concentration of covalent and non-covalent physical entanglements compared to healthy tissues, which greatly hinders permeability and transport of drugs and particles across the mucosae for therapeutic delivery. Treatment of CF lung diseases and associated infections must overcome this abnormal mucosal barrier. Critical bottlenecks hindering effective drug penetration remain and while recent studies have shown hydrophilic, net-neutral charge polymers can improve the transport of nanoparticles and minimize interactions with mucus, there is a dearth of alternative carriers available. We hypothesized that the screening of a phage peptide library against a CF mucus model would lead to the identification of phage-displayed peptide sequences able to improve transport in mucus. These combinatorial libraries possess a large diversity of peptide-based formulations (10(8)-10(9) ) to achieve unprecedented screening for potential mucus-penetrating peptides. Here, phage clones displaying discovered peptides were shown to have up to 2.6-fold enhanced diffusivity in the CF mucus model. In addition, we demonstrate reduced binding affinities to mucin compared to wild-type control. These findings suggest that phage display libraries can be used as a strategy to improve transmucosal delivery.

AB The impact of demographic ageing is likely to be of major significance in the coming decades due to low birth rates and higher life expectancy. Older people generally require more prescribed medicines due to the presence of multiple conditions such as dysphagia which can make swallowing medicines challenging. This study involves the development, characterization and optimization of composite wafers for potential oral and buccal delivery of low dose aspirin to prevent thrombosis in elderly patients with dysphagia. Blank (BLK) wafers (no loaded drug) were initially formulated by dissolving combinations of metolose (MET) with carrageenan (CAR) and MET with low molecular weight chitosan (CS) in different weight ratios in water, to identify optimum polymer combinations. However, drug loaded (DL) wafers were prepared using 45% v/v ethanol to help complete solubilization of the aspirin. The formulations were characterized using texture analyzer (hardness, mucoadhesion), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffractometry (XRD), attenuated total reflectance - Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA), and swelling capacity. Wafers with higher total polymer concentration were more resistant to penetration (MET:CAR 1:1 samples B2, C2) and MET:CS 1:1 (sample E2) and MET:CS 3:1 (sample F2) and also depended on the ratios between the polymers used. From the characterization, samples C2, B2, E2 and F2 showed the most ideal characteristics. XRD showed that BLK wafers were amorphous, whilst the DL wafers were crystalline due to the presence of aspirin. SEM confirmed the presence of pores within the polymer matrix of the BLK wafers, whilst DL wafers showed a more compact polymeric matrix with aspirin dispersed over the surface. The DL wafers showed a good flexibility required for transportation and patient handling and showed higher swelling capacity and adhesion values with phosphate buffer saline (PBS) than with simulated saliva (SS). Drug dissolution studies showed that aspirin was rapidly released in the first 20 min and then continuously over 1 h. FTIR confirmed the interaction of aspirin with the polymers evidenced by peak shifts around 1750 cm(-1) and the broad peak between 2500 and 3300 cm(-1). Lyophilized CAR: CS 1:3 (sample DL13), MET:CS 1:3 (sample DL8) and MET:CAR 3:1 (sample DL1) wafers seem to be a very promising system for the administration of low dose aspirin for older patients with dysphagia.

ID FLOW PROPERTIES; VARIABILITY; BEHAVIOR; DENSITY
AB Die filling is a critical process step in pharmaceutical tablet manufacturing. Mass and content uniformity of the tablets as well as production throughput depend upon the die filling performance of the formulations. The efficiency of the die filling process is influenced by powder properties, such as flowability, cohesion, particle size and morphology, as well as the process conditions. It is hence important to understand the influence of powder properties on the die filling performance. The purpose of the present study is to identify the critical material attributes that determine the efficiency of die filling. For this purpose, a model rotary die filling system was developed to mimic the die filling process in a typical rotary tablet press. The system consists of a round die table of 500 mm diameter, equipped with a rectangular die. The die table can rotate at an equivalent translational velocity of up to 1.5 m/s. The filling occurs when the die passes through a stationary shoe positioned above the die table. Using this system, die filling behaviours of 7 commonly used pharmaceutical excipients with various material characteristics (e.g. particle size distribution, sphericity and morphology) and flow properties were examined. The efficiency of die filling is evaluated using the concept of critical filling velocity. It was found that the critical filling velocity is strongly dependent on such properties as cohesion, flowability, average particle size and air sensitivity index. In particular, the critical filling velocity increases proportionally as the mean particle size, flow function, air permeability and air sensitivity index increase, while it decreases with the increase of specific energy and cohesion.

AB Printing technologies, both 2D and 3D, have gained considerable interest during the last years for manufacturing of personalized dosage forms, tailored to each patient. Here we review the research work on 2D printing techniques, mainly inkjet printing, for manufacturing of film-based oral dosage forms. We describe the different printing techniques and give an overview of film-based oral dosage forms produced using them. The main part of the review focuses on the non-destructive analytical methods used for evaluation of qualitative aspects of printed dosage forms, e.g., solid-state properties, as well as for quantification of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) in the printed dosage forms, with an emphasis on spectroscopic methods. Finally, the authors share their view on the future of printed dosage forms.

AB Antibiotic delivery via liposomal encapsulation represents a promising approach for the efficient topical treatment of skin infections. The present study aimed to investigate the potential of using different types of azithromycin (AZT)-loaded liposomes to locally treat skin infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains. Conventional liposomes (CLs), deformable liposomes (DLs), propylene glycol-containing liposomes (PGLs) and cationic liposomes (CATLs) encapsulating AZT were prepared, and their physical characteristics, drug release profiles, ex vivo skin penetration/deposition abilities, in vitro anti-MRSA activities (planktonic bacteria and biofilm) and cell biocompatibilities were assessed. The (phospho)lipid composition and presence of surfactant or propylene glycol affected the physical characteristics of the liposomes, the release profile of AZT, its deposition inside the skin, as well as in vitro antibacterial efficacy and tolerability with the skin cells. All the liposomes retained AZT inside the skin more efficiently than did the control and were biocompatible with keratinocytes and fibroblasts. CATLs, DLs and PGLs efficiently inhibited MRSA strain growth and were superior to free AZT in preventing biofilm formation, exhibiting minimal inhibitory concentrations and minimal biofilm inhibitory concentrations up to 32-fold lower than those of AZT solution, thus confirming their potential for improved topical treatment of MRSA-caused skin infections.

AB We investigated the influence of nanoparticle (NP) surface composition on different aspects of skin delivery of a lipophilic drug: chemical stability, release and skin penetration. Cholecalciferol was chosen as a labile model drug. Poly(lactic acid) (PLA)-based NPs without surface coating, with a non-ionic poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) coating, or with a zwitterionic poly(2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine) (PMPC) coating were prepared using flash nanoprecipitation. Process was optimized to obtain similar hydrodynamic diameters. Polymeric NPs were compared to non-polymeric cholecalciferol formulations. Cholecalciferol stability in aqueous medium was improved by polymeric encapsulation with a valuable effect of a hydrophilic coating. However, the in vitro release of the drug was found independent of the presence of any polymer, as for the drug penetration in an intact skin model. Such tendency was not observed in impaired skin since, when stratum corneum was removed, we found that a neutral hydrophilic coating around NPs reduced drug penetration compared to pure drug NPs and bare PLA NPs. The nature of the hydrophilic block (PEG or PMPC) had however no impact. We hypothesized that NPs surface influenced drug penetration in impaired skin due to different electrostatic interactions between NPs and charged skin components of viable skin layers.

AB Polymeric micelles, which form through the self-assembly of poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(amino acid) block copolymers, are systemic nanocarriers in targeted cancer therapy. These micelles can encapsulate therapeutic compounds, such as lipophilic substances, charged compounds, and metal complexes, that have characteristics of increased solubility, sustained release, and improved tissue distribution. However, few studies have been conducted on the local distribution of polymeric micelles. Thus, we evaluated the skin penetration pattern of hydrophobic drugs in polymeric micelles.
   We revealed that improved water solubility by the encapsulation of the hydrophobic drugs indomethacin and resveratrol in polymeric micelles significantly increased the amount of drugs penetrating into the skin. Moreover, polymeric micelles did not enhance the permeability of drugs. Furthermore, although the polymers remained on or in the stratum corneum, the encapsulated drugs gradually moved deeper into the skin. These results indicate that encapsulated hydrophobic drugs in polymeric micelles can penetrate the living cell layer of the skin without bringing about unexpected side effects associated with other ingredients in the formulation. Thus, polymeric micelles for encapsulating hydrophobic drugs can be used for skin applications.

AB The antimicrobial polypeptide epsilon-poly(L-lysine) (epsilon-PL) was electrostatically incorporated to poly(acrylic acid) (PAA)/poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) electrospun nanofibers. epsilon-PL loading and distribution was assessed by infrared spectra, zeta-potential measurements and the primary amino reactive dye fluorescamine. Functionalized fibers with 485 +/- 140 nm diameter, could be loaded with 0.57-0.74 g epsilon-PL (g dressing)(-1) that released at a constant rate of 5.4 +/- 2.8 mg epsilon-PL (g dressing day)(-1). Such a dressings resulted in two orders of magnitude lower bacterial colonization than non-functionalized PAA-PVA after 14 days of incubation. Bacterial impairment was attributed to the damage of cell membranes and the formation of intracellular reactive oxygen species. epsilon-PL functionalized nanofibers did not display cytotoxicity to human corneal epithelial cells, HCEpC, in 24 h MTT assays. However, the viability of rapidly growing tumoral HeLa cells decreased > 50% under the same conditions. The prepared biocompatible nanofibrous dressings with durable antibacterial activity show potential application as wound dressings and other biomedical uses.

AB This study presents the effect of a spiral mouthpiece design in a carrier-based dry powder inhalation on particle aerosol characteristics. Two kinds of mouthpieces, with spiral and non-spiral shaped flow channels, were fabricated by 3D-printing; particle image velocimetry and Anderson cascade impactor were performed to evaluate the drug aerosol characteristics. The obtained experimental results were in agreement with the simulation results of the computational fluid dynamics analysis. The spiral channel created a strong swirl motion of the air flow emitted from the mouthpiece exit, which produced angular momentum rather than the axial flow velocity in the forward direction. This is beneficial in terms of liberating the micronized drug particles from the carrier surface, and leads to more effective delivery of these drug particles to the peripheral target regions of the respiratory system. The spiral device could produce drug particles with significantly smaller mass median aerodynamic diameters and higher fine particle fraction than the non-spiral device.

AB Curcuma comosa (C. comosa) is a Thai medicinal herb that provides numerous pharmacologic activities due to its estrogen-like action. This study aimed to investigate the use of liquisolid technique to prepare tablets containing oleoresin-like crude extract of C. comosa, and to improve the dissolution profiles of its major compounds, diarylheptanoids (DAs). Free flowing powders of C. comosa extract were obtained by adsorption onto solid carriers, microcrystalline cellulose, with colloidal silica as coating material. FTIR results ruled out possible interactions between C. comosa extract and excipients. The results indicated that all of liquisolid tablets met the USP requirements. The release of DAs were significantly increased through liquisolid formulations, compared to crude extract. By decreasing the ratio of carrier to coating from 20 to 10, an improvement in dissolution rate was observed. Addition of additives - namely polymer (polyvinyl pyrrolidone) and/or nonvolatile liquid (propylene glycol) affected tablet properties which involved longer disintegration time and lower DA dissolution. Optimized C. comosa liquisolid formulation was prepared in a carrier to coating ratio of 10 without additives. Stability studies showed that physical properties of liquisolid tablet were not affected by aging, but percent remaining and dissolution profiles of DAs were influenced by storage temperature. In vivo pharmacokinetic behavior of the optimized C. comosa liquisolid tablets was investigated following a single oral administration to rabbits. The results proved that the method used for preparation of liquisolid led to C. comosa tablets with low variation in content uniformity and tablet properties, as well as enhanced dissolution behavior.

AB A dual-targeting drug delivery system for paclitaxel (PTX) was developed by functionalizing novel polyester-based nanoparticles (NPs) with peptides possessing special affinity for low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), overcoming the limitations of the current chemotherapeutics, to transport drug from blood to brain, and then target glioma cells. Employing novel biodegradable block co-polymers (P and 2P), PTX loaded and peptide-functionalized nanoparticles were prepared by a modified nano-co-precipitation method, carried out in one step only without emulsifier, allowing to obtain spherical nanometric ( < 200 nm), monodisperse (PDI similar to 0.1), Poly (Ethylene Glycol) (PEG)-coated and high PTX loaded NPs with a slow and controlled release rate for a prolonged period of time. Peptide functionalization, confirmed by fluorimetric assay and HPLC amino acids analysis, enhanced the cellular uptake of functionalized-PTX-NPs by human primary glioblastoma cell line (U-87 MG) and Bovine Brain Endothelial Cells (BBMVECs), compared with non-functionalized-PTX-NPs. To confirm dual-targeting effect, transendothelial transport experiments in an in vitro BBB model and in vitro anti-tumoral activity against U-87 MG revealed that peptide-functionalized-PTX-NPs significantly increased the transport ratio of PTX across the BBB along with an improved anti-proliferative efficiency. Pharmacokinetics and biodistribution studies in rats, carried out by in vivo experiments with I-125 radiolabelled dual-targeting PTX-NPs, confirmed the stealthy behavior of NPs and indicated slightly lower levels of penetration into brain tissue in comparison with peptides known to be able to cross the BBB. These promising results suggested that the dual-targeting drug delivery system might have great potential for glioma therapy in clinical applications.

AB In this study we investigated the possibility of using polyelectrolytes with antibacterial properties to form layerby-layer (LbL) coatings on contact lens materials with the objective of controlling the release of ophthalmic drugs, while minimizing bacterial growth. A silicone-based hydrogel recently proposed by our group was chosen as a drug releasing soft contact lens (SCL) material and three drugs were tested: moxifloxacin hydrochloride (MXF), chlorhexidine diacetate monohydrate (CHX), and diclofenac sodium salt (DIC). Employed coatings involved combinations of sodium alginate (ALG), chitosan (CHI), sodium hyaluronate (HA) and polylysine hydrobromide (PLL), using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) as a cross-linking agent. Controlled release of DIC was achieved using two double layers of the following combinations: ALG/PLL (EDC), HA (EDC)/CHI and HA/PLL (EDC) + Drug. Furthermore, the physical properties of the coated lens material were kept, or even improved, and bacterial growth was reduced. In contrast, these coatings did not retard the release of MXF and CHX. The specificity of the barrier effect of these LbL films for DIC may be attributed to the formation of reversible interactions between DIC and the polyelectrolyte chains. A top layer of HA was needed to reduce the interaction with tear proteins. The in vivo efficacy of a contact lens coated with ALG/PLL (EDC)//HA and loaded with DIC was predicted using a simplified mathematical model to estimate the drug concentration in the tear fluid. The period of time during which the estimated concentration of DIC remained above the half-maximum inhibitory concentrations for the active enzymes in the process of inflammation, was at least double that obtained with the uncoated sample.

AB Cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) are proposed to be responsible for tumor metastasis, resistance and relapse after therapy, but are unable to be eliminated by many current therapies. Herein, we report that the apoferritin nanocages loading cytotoxic mertansine (M-AFN) can significantly improve their uptake in CSCs-enriched tumorspheres and effectively eradicate CSCs in tumorspheres for anticancer therapy. M-AFN were uniformly nanocage structures with the mean diameter of 11.26 +/- 2.58 nm and the loading capacity of 0.62%. In the CSCs-enriched tumorsphere model, M-AFN could be preferentially internalized by tumorsphere cells and the average half-inhibitory concentration (IC50) of M-AFN was obviously reduced by 5.46-fold when comparing to the parent 4T1 breast cancer cells. Moreover, both the already existing tumorspheres and the formation of secondary tumorspheres were drastically disrupted by M-AFN, but barely impacted by mertansine alone. The flow cytometer analysis showed the CSCs fractions in tumorspheres were considerably reduced by the M-AFN treatment. Therefore, the apoferritin nanocages represent an encouraging nanoplatform to eradicate CSCs for effective anticancer therapy.

AB Curcumin (CUR) chewing gums have potential therapeutic benefits to head and neck cancer patients. The objective of this work was to develop medicated chewing gums (MCGs) with high CUR loading and desirable mastication properties. This was accomplished by evaluating the effect of five gum ingredients: (X-1) polyisobutene, (X-2) polyvinyl acetate, (X-3) wood rosin, (X-4) wax, and (X-5) CUR on the mechanical properties of the MCGs using a 25-run, five-factor, two-level D-Optimal mixture design. CUR MCGs were prepared by the conventional fusion method for making chewing gums. They were characterized by a two-bites texture and uniaxial tension tests to generate force-displacement curves from which the cohesiveness (Y-1), springiness (Y-2), chewiness (Y-3), compressibility (Y-4), resistance to extension (Y-5), and extensibility (Y-6) were measured. Observed responses were used to generate polynomial models correlating the independent with the dependent variables. Elasticity and stiffness of the gums were found to be readily impacted by PIB and CUR levels. Fitted models were then used to predict a gum composition that has comparable mechanical properties to commercially procured chewing gums. The optimized MCG was loaded with 50% of either CUR or CUR/SBE-beta-CD inclusion complex and tested in vitro for drug release. Although no differences in mechanical properties were observed, substituting CUR with the inclusion complex was found to significantly enhance drug release. This study highlighted the impact of each gum ingredient on the quality of the MCGs and demonstrated the feasibility of preparing chewing gums with up to 50% drug loading.

AB The objective of the present study was to develop, characterize and evaluate the clinical efficacy of topical formulations containing or not active substances and UV-filters, separate and in combination. To this end a stable formulation was developed to which four aqueous active substances and four lipophilic UV-filters were added. The formulations were then submitted to microscopic characterization by light microscopy, to particle size measurement, and to macroscopic characterization by rheology and texture analysis. Finally, a clinical efficacy study was conducted to determine the effect of the formulations on the skin after application for 1 h. The formulation containing UV-filters showed a high polydisperse microstructure and a large amount of liquid crystals. The formulations containing active substances showed higher resistance to deformation, compression and penetration tests. Regarding spreadability, formulations containing UV filters alone or in combination with active substances showed higher resistance to spreading. This behavior was associated with greater clinical efficacy in terms of stratum corneum water content, protection of the skin barrier function and skin surface brightness. It was demonstrated that the efficacy of the formulation is mainly associated with its structure and the way it interacts with the skin surface. Finally, this study showed that the mixture of these ingredients for the development of multifunctional sunscreens improves the performance of the formulations.

AB Knowledge on the dissolution behaviour of a drug is critical for efficient and effective product development. As the drug has almost always to be formulated with excipients in the design of a dosage form, it is important to examine the implications of the choice of excipients on the dissolution of the drug, among others, especially in the case of an immediate release dosage form. The objective of this study was to explore the potential of using an ultraviolet (UV) imaging technique to examine the effect of drug-excipient ratio on the initial dissolution of the drug, when formulated with a hydrophilic, water insoluble excipient. A series of drug-excipient binary blends with different ratios were prepared and compacted into 2 mm compacts, and their dissolution profiles captured with a UV imager. Chemical imaging via Raman spectroscopy was also performed on the compacts to quantify the fraction of drug presented on the compact surface. At low drug concentrations, a suppression in drug dissolution was observed, but beyond a critical drug-excipient ratio, the concentration of the excipient no longer played a role in affecting drug dissolution rates. Drug particle size was found to affect the critical drug-excipient ratio required to negate the shielding effect exerted by the excipient, such that a higher proportion of drug was required. It is postulated that the excipient served as a physical barrier, as well as competitor for water required for wetting during initial dissolution, thereby causing a delay in the wetting and dissolution of the drug.

AB Most of the recent drug compounds coming out of the drug discovery pipeline are labile (multiple polymorphs), and need to be developed into robust marketed oral drug formulations. There are only 22 oral macroamorphous drug products approved by FDA and till date none approved oral nanoamorphous drug products. However, there are several oral nanoamorphous drug formulations (including both labile and non-labile drugs) being researched and a few of these are in the clinical trials. Due to the labile nature of these drug compounds, there is a need to utilize a controlled strategy for design and development of robust nanoamorphous drug formulations in order to prevent any physicochemical instability. The present research focuses on the use of a novel integrated critical process parameters and critical formulation parameters (iCPP-CFPs) DoE approach for the design and development of stable nanoamorphous spironolactone (BCS class II compound with eight polymorphic forms). There are possibilities of the interconversion of these polymorphic forms during processing (manufacturing nanoamorphous particles) and during storage. In the present study, polymorphic transitions (amorphous to crystalline and anhydrous to hydrate) were carefully monitored via orthogonal solid-state characterization tools. Significant polymorphic transitions were observed in the formulations stored at 40 degrees C/75% RH over six months, however the formulations stored at 4 degrees C were stable. The significant iCPP-CFPs (solvent-to-antisolvent ratio, drug concentration and inlet temperature of the spray dryer) were critically investigated for their influence on different CQAs (critical quality attributes). Solvent-to-antisolvent ratio and inlet temperature were identified to be the significant iCPP-CFPs. Particle size and total product yield were identified to be the significant CQAs. Lab-scale manufacturing of the spray dried nanoamorphous spironolactone resulted in a remarkably high total product yield (82.4 +/- 3.91% w/w) with a uniform and homogenous particle size (244.2 +/- 23.32 nm). Furthermore, the physicochemical attributes and the drug release criteria of the nanoamorphous spironolactone were compared with two marketed products (spironolactone tablets, USP 100 mg (Pfizer and Mylan)) and other in-house formulations. In addition, nanoamorphous spironolactone showed a significantly superior kinetic solubility/ dissolution rate (10-fold) with a longer supersaturation time (similar to 6h) compared to the in-house formulations.

AB The drug carvedilol, used to treat cardiovascular conditions, is known to exist in distinct crystalline forms. Polymorphs II and III and the hydrate are characterized by variations in their molecular packing and conformation. This study deals with the spectroscopic (supported by quantum chemistry calculations) characterization of carvedilol structures. Band assignments were performed considering the isolated molecules and periodic calculations. We discuss the correlation between the vibrational modes and the intermolecular forces in the crystalline structures. Towards a better understanding of the intermolecular interactions, Hirshfeld surface was used. Besides band shifts related to stretching vibrations of N-H and O-H groups, differences between other modes have shown the possibility of using infrared spectroscopy to distinguish the crystal forms; technique routinely used in quality control of pharmaceutics. According to the spectroscopic analysis, the N-H groups participate in stronger bonds in the polymorph III, which contributes to its greater stability. With Hirshfeld surface we concluded that the bond with the nitrogen of the aliphatic chain participating as hydrogen acceptor in polymorph II is responsible for the pointy peaks in the fingerprint plot. This can explain why polymorph II shows lower dissolution in acid medium, as described in a previous work of our group.

AB Glimepiride (GLIM) is used as an oral antihyperglycemic agent for treatment of type 2 diabetes. The drug presents two polymorphic forms (GLIM form I and GLIM form II) described in the literature, and according to in vitro data, GLIM form II is about 3.5 times more soluble and releases 2 times the drug amount than GLIM form I in the physiological pH range. Considering the literature in vitro data and that the diabetes treatment demands glycemic control, avoiding abrupt fluctuations in the blood glucose levels, this work aimed to study the impact of GLIM polymorphism in the in vivo performance of GLIM solid oral dosages. For this, hard gelatin capsules with GLIM form I or II were prepared and orally administered in rats. After that, pharmacokinetic studies were performed by sampling animal blood at different times, and biochemical parameters (pharmacodynamic), such as glucose and insulin, were also evaluated. Our results showed that the in vitro data corroborate with our in vivo assays. GLIM form II provided higher plasma concentration of drug than form I (at baseline up to approximately 200 min after oral administration) and, consequently, increased insulin release and reduced levels of glucose, showing good correlation between pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics assays. Thus, this study demonstrated that GLIM polymorphs in oral dosages might alter the drug efficacy, which may expose the patients to risks, such as hypoglycemia.

ID FORMULATION
AB In the design of the orally disintegrating films (ODFs), it is important to determine the disintegration time (DT) precisely and properly. These films' DTs are usually assessed by a disintegration test defined in the pharmacopoeias, but under the conditions of such tests, a much larger volume of water is used and a stronger up-down movement is applied compared to the conditions of the human oral cavity. Here we developed and tested our new disintegration test system for ODFs. We chose a disintegration test device (the Tricorptester (R), Okada Seiko, Tokyo) for orally disintegrating tablets. This device enabled the mechanical dropping of the test medium. We designed an exclusive fixture for ODFs, made an opening in the center of the fixture, and optimized the size of the opening (i.e., the cell). We also investigated that test conditions including the types of test media, the dropping height, flow rate, dropping methods, and medium holding methods. With a passage sensor attached to the Tricorptester, the device was able to automatically detect the DTs of ODFs. We thus successfully developed a new disintegration test system and optimized the operating conditions. Using this system, model ODFs and the commercial ODFs can be properly evaluated.

AB CHF5633 (Chiesi Farmaceutici, Italy) is a synthetic pulmonary surfactant currently under clinical development for the treatment of Respiratory Distress Syndrome in premature infants. The product is composed of phospholipids in liposomal organization, together with two peptide analogues of human surfactant proteins B and C. Phospholipids in liposomes can undergo oxidation of unsaturated lipids and hydrolysis, with formation of fatty acids and lysolipids, both affecting the physico-chemical properties of the formulation. We exploited two fluorescence probes, Prodan and ADIFAB, to evaluate the stability of the phospholipid components of CHF5633. While Prodan enters the phospholipid bilayer and probes the polarity of this environment, ADIFAB binds free fatty acids in the aqueous phase, allowing to determine their concentration. Changes of Prodan fluorescence emission indicated an increase in the polarity of the phospholipid bilayer as a function of time. This behavior is coupled with an increase in fatty acids concentration in the aqueous phase, as determined by ADIFAB, and an increase in lysolipids concentration, as determined by HPLC-MS. Prodan and ADIFAB resulted efficient probes to monitor phospholipids hydrolysis in liposomes, reporting an increased stability of CHF5633 at pH values higher than 6.5.

AB BRAF is the most frequently mutated gene in skin melanoma. Applying BRAF siRNA (siBraf) to silencing BRAF gene is a current frontline therapy for melanoma. However, delivery of macromolecular siRNA into the tumor site and introduction of siRNA into the tumor cells remain as challenges. In this study, we for the first time developed a siBraf delivery system based on cell penetrating peptide octaarginine (R8) nanocomplexes combined with coated microneedles (MNs), i.e. R8/siBraf coated MNs, for targeted anti-melanoma treatment. The R8/ siBraf nanocomplexes were optimized based on the internalization of siBraf by A375 cells. In vitro A375 cell experiments presented that R8/siBraf can enhance siBraf transfection, silence BRAF gene, and inhibit tumor cells growth, comparable to polyethylenimine (PEI)/siBraf. R8/siBraf coated MNs can effectively deliver R8/siBraf into the disease site. In vivo anti-melanoma experiments indicated that R8/siBraf coated MNs can significantly inhibit the melanoma development, induce the tumor cells apoptosis, and suppress their proliferation. The BRAF gene in tumor were also significantly silenced in vivo. SiBraf intradermal delivery via combining MNs and R8 nanocomplexes is a promising approach for skin melanoma treatment, which exploited both virtues of MNs and cell penetrating peptide to obtain the targeting inhibition efficacy on skin melanoma.

AB Nanotechnology-based interventions have gained popularity in the past decade for cancer therapy owing to their ability to overcome several shortcomings encountered in conventional therapy. Among the various nanoparticles that have been explored as drug carriers, mesoporous silica possesses certain desirable properties such as regulated pore size, high surface area, chemical and thermal stability, amenability for surface modification and biocompatibility. These systems have been widely investigated for site-specific delivery of single and multiple therapeutic agents as well as for imaging and theranostic applications. In recent times, the concept of targeted and sustained delivery of the therapeutic agent has transformed into a more attractive and effective approach of triggered drug release thereby ushering in an era of 'on-demand' drug delivery. Mesoporous silica due to its tunable surface functionalities has emerged in the forefront of triggered release systems. Though different types of external stimuli have been extensively investigated to bring about triggered drug release from mesoporous silica, chemo-responsive systems offer more therapeutic effectiveness with minimal collateral damage commonly associated with external stimuli. Chemo-responsiveness is generally achieved by introducing an appropriate gate-keeper molecule at the pore surface that regulates the diffusion of the drug molecules. This review analyzes different strategies that have been attempted to achieve 'on-demand' drug release in mesoporous silica carriers in response to various types of chemical stimuli. Emerging trends in the field of chemo-responsive mesoporous silica are also presented in this review.

AB FDA approval of CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (CpG ODN) adjuvants for a human hepatitis B virus vaccine has been delayed until late 2017 because of concerns regarding the severe side effects, which may be attributed to the high dosage and systemic diffusion of this proinflammatory material. Considering that PLGA could provide shelter to resist nucleases in tissue and that cationic lipids could confine anionic oligonucleotides in the nanoparticles via electrostatic attraction to avoid systemic diffusion, we encapsulated a natural phosphodiester or the expensive phosphorothioate CpG ODNs in our previously reported hyaluronic acid-modified cationic lipid-PLGA hybrid nanoparticles and evaluated vaccine efficacy in a TC-1-grafted mouse model. Our results showed that together with Poly I:C, CpG ODN could promote the maturation of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells and the cross-presentation of exogenous antigens in vitro. For the coencapsulation with Poly I:C, in vivo studies showed that adjuvant effects on the vaccine efficacy of tumor depression, immune cell activation, and memory T-cell elevation of phosphodiester CpG ODNs were comparable to those of the phosphorothioate CpG ODNs at a low concentration (5 mu g/dose). In conclusion, the combination of oligonucleotide adjuvants and synthetic particulate systems not only potentiated the immunogenicity of these nanoparticles but also made these adjuvants safer and more economical, which may be helpful for their wide application.

AB Capping is a common mechanical defect in tablet manufacturing, exhibited during or after the compression process. Predicting tablet capping in terms of process variables (e.g. compaction pressure and speed) and formulation properties is essential in pharmaceutical industry. In current work, a non-destructive contact ultrasonic approach for detecting capping risk in the pharmaceutical compacts prepared under various compression forces and speeds is presented. It is shown that the extracted mechanical properties can be used as early indicators for invisible capping (prior to visible damage). Based on the analysis of X-ray cross-section images and a large set of waveform data, it is demonstrated that the mechanical properties and acoustic wave propagation characteristics is significantly modulated by the tablet's internal cracks and capping at higher compaction speeds and pressures. In addition, the experimentally extracted properties were correlated to the directly-measured porosity and tensile strength of compacts of Pearlitol (R), Anhydrous Mannitol and LubriTose (R) Mannitol, produced at two compaction speeds and at three pressure levels. The effect compaction speed and pressure on the porosity and tensile strength of the resulting compacts is quantified, and related to the compact acoustic characteristics and mechanical properties. The detailed experimental approach and reported wave propagation data could find key applications in determining the bounds of manufacturing design spaces in the development phase, predicting capping during (continuous) tablet manufacturing, as well as online monitoring of tablet mechanical integrity and reducing batch-to-batch end-product quality variations.

AB Multidrug resistance (MDR), as a major obstacle in cancer therapy, has resulted in over 90% of cancer chemotherapeutic failure. Mesoporous silica nanospheres (MSNs) have been demonstrated to be tuned with large pore sizes, mediating the MDR-reversal effects. However, the study that surface functionality of the large pore sized-MSNs affects the MDR-overcoming effects hasn't been extensively studied. In this study, we developed a new dendrimer-like MSNs delivery system based on a rational synthesis strategy and further modified MSNs with various surface functionalities to evaluate their roles in overcoming cancer MDR. Our results showed that the small particle sized-MSNs could be fabricated with dendrimer-like internal structure, resulting in the large pore size of 9 nm. Surface functionality of MSNs, especially hydroxylation and carboxylation, largely improved the intra-nuclear delivery and therapeutic efficiency of DOX for MCF7/ADR cells, which was not up to inhibiting P-gp expression but significantly increasing the intracellular drug accumulation of over 90% even under the strong drug efflux. This study indicates that surface functionality design strategy may display the potential of the large pore sized-MSNs as the efficient chemotherapeutic carriers to combat MDR.

AB Gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) have been considered to be a promising candidate for hyperthermia-based anticancer therapy. Herein, we introduce albumin-assisted AuNCs composed of small gold nanoparticles (AuNPs, < 6 nm) assembled with strands of polyallylamine (PAH), which exhibited strong surface plasmon resonance upon nearinfrared (NIR, similar to 808 nm) laser irradiation and good in vivo stability. Our albumin-assisted PAH-AuNCs (BSA/PAH-AuNCs) were facilely fabricated as a top-down process by a simple ultrasonication after the preparation of large nano-aggregates of PAH-AuNPs. Albumin played a critical role as a stabilizer and surfactant in making loosely associated large aggregates and thereby producing small gold nanoclusters (similar to 60 nm) of slightly negative charge upon ultrasonication. The prepared BSA/PAH-AuNCs displayed excellent hyperthermal effects (similar to 60 degrees C) in response to similar to 808-nm NIR laser irradiation in a 4T1 cell system in vitro and in 4T1 cell tumor xenograft mice in vivo, indicating their remarkable potential to suppress breast cancer growth, without almost no significant toxicity in histology. Consequently, our gold nanoclusters should be considered as a promising photothermal agent that are easy to manufacture and exhibit marked anticancer effects in terms of tumor ablation.

AB The aim of this research was to evaluate the potential of two chitosan (CS)-based hydrogel systems for nasal delivery of exenatide (EXT) in rats. Both of the EXT-loaded CS/glycerophosphate (GP)/CaCl2 (EXT/CS/GP/CaCl2) and EXT/CS/GP/MgCl2 hydrogel systems had similar in vitro release profiles. However, a difference in metal salt surprisingly resulted in multifaceted differences between the two hydrogel systems, such as EXT stability, gelation time, transepithelial transport, biodistribution and pharmacokinetics. The gelation time of the EXT/CS/GP/MgCl2 hydrogel (more than 110 min) at 37 degrees C was much longer than that of the EXT/CS/GP/CaCl2 hydrogel (8.0-20.4 min). Transepithelial transport analysis showed that the CS/GP/MgCl2 hydrogel enhanced EXT transport across the Calu-3 cell monolayers more than the CS/GP/CaCl2 hydrogel (P < 0.05). After nasal administration in the rats, the EXT/CS/GP/MgCl2 hydrogel increased the distribution of EXT in the targeting organs and the relative bioavailability of EXT in the rats more than the EXT/CS/GP/CaCl2 hydrogel. Moreover, both EXT/CS/GP/salt hydrogel formulation treatments in high-fat-fed rats significantly decreased food intake and body weight relative to the EXT solution within ten days (P < 0.05). The aforementioned results suggest that the EXT/CS/GP/MgCl2 hydrogel formulation is more suitable to be used as a nasally delivered EXT formulation for the treatment of weight loss.

AB Sertaconazole nitrate (STZ) is a poorly soluble antifungal drug commonly used for treating fungal skin infections. Introducing it as a new treatment option for the management of fungal keratitis, requires the development of a delivery system capable of targeting the infected cornea with an adequate STZ concentration. Hence, Sertaconazole nitrate loaded cubosomes (STZ-CUBS) were prepared, characterized and optimized based on a 3(3) central composite face-centred design. Optimized formulation (CUB-opt) showed maximum desirability (0.905), with solubilization efficiency (SE%) of 94.50 +/- 0.51%, particle size (PS) of 216.55 +/- 2.33 nm, polydispersity index (PDI) of 0.229 +/- 0.11 and zeta potential (ZP) of 34.00 +/- 6.93 mV. Under the transmission electron microscope, it showed discrete cubic shaped structures. Moreover, it exhibited a promising mucoadhesive behavior, terminal sterilization stability, and storage stability. Ex vivo corneal permeation study revealed its ability to enhance the steady state flux (J(ss)) and the permeability coefficient (K-P) of STZ, compared to STZ-suspension. Finally, CUB-opt formulation was found to be safe on the corneal tissues in the in vivo corneal tolerance study, and demonstrated a superior corneal penetration power in the in vivo corneal uptake study.

AB Curcumin, a low molecular weight, hydrophobic compound, exhibits strong anti-cancer effects and has a high margin of safety. However, its poor water solubility, rapid metabolism and degradation make it relatively ineffective, but intracellular delivery using nanoparticles (NPs) would solve these problems. In this study, we formulated curcumin in two-structurally distinct NPs: a nanoemulsion (Cur-NE) and a Niosome (Cur-NIO), evaluated their in-vitro cytotoxic effects and examined their mechanisms of drug delivery. The use of Cur-NIO resulted in an unexpected increase in the intracellular accumulation of curcumin and induced a potent cytotoxic effect compared to Cur-NE. To our surprise, however, the effects of the endocytosis of NIO as well as that for NE on the cellular delivery of curcumin were negligible. Consequently, we concluded that Cur-NIO delivers curcumin directly to the cytosol via transfer from the NIO to the cell membrane. The results of Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and phase-transfer studies indicate that Cur-NIO exhibits efficient transfer into model membranes or organic interfaces. Moreover, we found that Cur-NE shows a poor transfer efficiency. This could be due to the presence of a hydrophobic oil core that reduces the probability of curcumin to transfer upon contact with the membrane. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of the effect of NP structure on the membrane-mediated transfer efficiency of low molecular weight, hydrophobic compounds.

The aim was to identify a formulation window with desired functional ASD performance, i.e. physical stability and immediate API release, as well as processability in strand pelletization. Samples were prepared using small-scale methods, such as vacuum compression molding (VCM) and benchtop extrusion. Miscibility and phase studies were performed for a wide range of polymer ratios and three levels of API content (10-30% w/w). Ternary ASD formulations were phase-separated, yet physically stable upon exposure to elevated temperature/ humidity. A study of phase composition showed that the drug molecules were predominantly solubilized in the Eudragit E fraction of the formulation. The miscibility study and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy indicated hydrogen (H)-bond interactions between NMD and Eudragit E. In HPMC, the amorphous API was dispersed in polymeric matrix and stabilized due to anti-plasticization and the disruption of intermolecular H-bonding between API molecules. Concerning processability in strand pelletization the formulation is limited at high Eudragit E content. NMD and EE-rich phases exhibit low mixture glass transition, low melt stability and brittle breaking behavior upon strand cuffing. The high viscosity and yield point of HPMC contributes to the mechanical robustness of the strand at temperatures relevant for processing. Formulation-intrinsic dissolution rates in VCM ASDs developed as an irregular function of polymer ratio, associated with diverse and competitive dissolution mechanisms in the polymers. With regard to the binary system of NMD with HPMC E5, surface crystallization was observed in VCM ASDs. For extruded pellets this was not the case, and a steady trend of formulation-intrinsic dissolution rate across different polymer ratios was observed. These discrepancies indicated a major influence of shear stress during sample preparation on HPMC-based ASD performance. Finally, a feasible formulation window within a polymer ratio of 1:2-2:3 Eudragit E:HPMC was identified in which Eudragit E acts as a dissolution rate enhancer and ASD stabilizer during dissolution.

AB Co-administration of solid oral dosage forms with soft food or beverages is commonly used to facilitate administration and to improve compliance in the paediatric and geriatric population and in patient groups with swallowing difficulties.
   The present case study was conducted to investigate the compatibility, stability and dissolution of Basmisanil administered as granules mixed with different soft food matrices. The data were generated to justify dosing instructions, according which Basmisanil should be sprinkled on or mixed with one tablespoon of soft food to aid swallowing. Different soft food types were selected to cover a broad range of various food components (e.g. fat, protein, carbohydrates, fiber and water) and pH. Active content and degradation products of the active substance were determined after mixing the granules with the semisolid food matrix and after two hours of storage under ambient conditions, respectively. In-vitro dissolution tests of granule/food mixtures were also conducted. Furthermore, the stability of the API polymorph was evaluated.
   Basmisanil shows good chemical stability when the granules are mixed with soft food and consumed within two hours. No polymorphic conversion (anhydrate to monohydrate) could be detected in the granule/food mixtures after preparation and after storage up to 24 h. The in-vitro dissolution of the API from the granules was not adversely affected by the presence of the food matrix. All results were comparable regardless of the tested food matrix. The results do not prohibit the administration of the granules with soft food to the patient.

AB Essential oils containing monoterpenes are widely used in pharmaceuticals and cosmetic products on account of their wide range of bioactive properties (including anti-cancer activity). Two monoterpenes (citral and geraniol) were firstly tested for their anti-inflammatory activity in a RAW 264.7 cell line, demonstrating citral to have enhanced capacity to inhibit NO production (ca. 84% for citral and 52% for geraniol at the lowest tested concentration of 5 mu g/ml). As citral showed higher NO inhibitory activity than geraniol, to measure the level of cytotoxicity of citral, AlamarBlue reduction assay was run in two cell models (non-tumoral HaCaT and tumoral A431). Citral exhibited a strong cytotoxic effect in both cell lines, i.e. cell viability lower that 10% after 24 h exposure at 100 mu g/ml of monoterpene. An optimized solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) formulation for citral was further developed by design of experiments (2(2) factorial design), followed by accelerated stability testing (LUMiSizer (R)). An optimal SLN composed of 1 wt% of citral, 4 wt% of lipid and 2.5 wt% surfactant were successfully produced by hot high pressure homogenization (hot HPH) showing a mean particle size (Z-Ave) of 97.7 nm and polydispersity index of 0.249. The produced formulations were analyzed in a high-end dispersion analyzer LUMiSizer (R) to characterize any demixing phenomena, demonstrating to be long-term stable at room temperature (25 degrees C), exhibiting very low instability indices (0.032 after production and 0.042 after one month of storage).

AB The objective of the current study was to optimize for the first time the formulation variables of self-emulsified drug delivery system (SEDDS) based on drug solubilization during lipolysis under a biorelevant condition of digestion such as lipase activity, temperature, pH, fed-fasting state, etc. Nimodipine (ND), a BCS class II, was used as a model drug to prepare the SEDDS. Various oils, surfactants, and cosurfactants were screened for their solubilization potential of ND. Area of self-emulsification was identified using various ternary phase diagrams. Box-Behnken design was employed to investigate effects of formulation variables on various dispersion, emulsification, and lipolysis characteristics of SEDDS. Among 26 candidate formulations, highest ND solubility of 12.72%, 11.09% and 11.2% w/w were obtained in peppermint oil as the oily phase, Cremphor EL as the surfactant and PEG400 as the cosurfactant, respectively. Cremphor EL was the most significant factor to decrease SEDDS droplet size to 30.16 nm. On the other hand, increasing the oil concentration was found to significantly increase the polydispersity index up to 0.31. A faster emulsification rate of 3.37%/min was obtained at higher Cremphor El/PEG 400 ratio. Increasing the percentage of lipid components of SEDDS resulted in lower rate of lipolysis with less recovery of ND in aqueous phase. Under fed state, percentage of lipolysis of optimized formulation was less than that observed under fasted state. However, lowest rate and percentage of lipolysis were observed in lipolysis media without phospholipids and bile salts. Hence, this study demonstrated that in vitro lipolysis could be used as a surrogate approach to distinguish effects of formulation variables on fate of SEDDS upon digestion. Further studies are in progress to identify the lipolytic products of the employed excipients by LC-MS/MS.

AB Hot melt extrusion (HME) can be used to produce amorphous solid dispersions (ASDs) at temperatures below the drug's melting point if the drug and polymer exhibit melting point depression. However, the risk of residual crystallinity becomes significant. The purpose of this study was to apply the temperature-composition phase diagram to the HME process, correlating process conditions to ASD residual crystallinity, and identifying the formulation critical temperature, which defines the theoretical minimum processing temperature. The phase diagram of indomethacin (IDM) and polyvinylpyrrolidone/vinyl acetate copolymer (PVPVA) was generated using melting point depression measurements coupled with Flory-Huggins theory. Extrudates were manufactured above, at, and below the formulation critical temperature (T-c) as identified from the phase diagram, with a range of residence times, and characterized for crystallinity. Below the T-c, a fully amorphous sample could not be prepared. Above T-c, sufficient residence time led to amorphous samples. A processing operating design space diagram with three regimes was generated to correlate temperature and residence time factors with process outcome. In conclusion, phase diagrams provide a rational basis for designing hot melt extrusion processes of amorphous solid dispersions to minimize residual crystalline content, delineating the minimum processing temperature based on thermodynamic considerations.

AB Pre-administration of physostigmine can prevent poisoning against nerve agent exposure by reversibly binding to cholinesterase. However, its cholinesterase protection-based prophylactic effect can be eliminated rapidly due to short biological half-life. Liposomes are useful for encapsulating hydrophilic drugs like physostigmine, and can be used for sustained release after parenteral injection. Thus, physostigmine liposomes were prepared by the pH-gradient condition-based remote-loading method for subcutaneous injection. In addition, polyethylene glycol (PEG)-lipid was applied to further extend the release of physostigmine and its prophylactic action. In vitro release of physostigmine, pharmacokinetics and duration of prophylactic effect were then evaluated. Physostigmine was dissolved in distilled water and used as a solution group for comparison. The prepared liposomes showed spherical shape and their particle size was around 130 mu m. Addition of PEG-lipid in liposomes significantly increased the entrapment efficiency of physostigmine. Both control and PEG liposomes exhibited sustained release pattern compared to the solution. Moreover, the release of PEG liposomes was relatively slower than that of the control liposomes. Pharmacokinetic study in rats revealed that physostigmine liposomes exhibited lower maximum plasma concentration and longer half-life compared to the solution. Plasma cholinesterase inhibition ratio in the liposomal group decreased more gradually compared to the solution. Moreover, PEG liposomes showed higher plasma concentration of physostigmine and cholinesterase inhibition ratio compared to the control liposomes. These results suggest that PEG liposomes have potential to enhance the duration of cholinesterase-protecting effect of physostigmine.

AB The distribution of granulating liquid is known to affect the high shear wet granulation process but the impact of the spray nozzle attributes is still unclear. While homogenous liquid distribution can be achieved by using a spray nozzle, the effect of different nozzle aperture sizes on granule properties is not well understood. In this study, nozzles of different aperture sizes were used to introduce the granulating liquid in high shear wet granulation using different process parameters. Design of experiment approach was utilised to assess effect of process parameters on granule properties. Granules produced with different spray nozzles were evaluated for binder distribution inhomogeneity, size, shape, flowability and compression attributes such as tabletability and yield pressure. Coarser granules with better flow properties were produced using the smaller aperture size nozzle. On the other hand, granules had better tabletability and lower yield pressure when larger aperture size nozzle was used. Furthermore, size of granules produced by using larger aperture size nozzle was more affected by changes in the process variables which could be influenced by the differences in granulating liquid feed rate and spray droplet size. Although the granules aspect ratios were comparable across the nozzle aperture sizes, granules produced from smaller aperture size nozzle appeared to be rounder. Regardless of the nozzle aperture sizes, homogenous binder distribution was achieved. The findings from this study could be a useful guide to the selection of the appropriate nozzle aperture size in wet granulation.

AB In recent years, gold (Au) and silver (Ag) nanoparticles (NPs) have been the centerstage of improving cancer treatments and therapies, substantially attributed to their size and shape tuneable chemical, optical and photonic properties. Owing to such specialties, diverse shapes of Au and Ag NPs have enabled an efficient cellular uptake along with remarkable improvements in early stage diagnosis of tumors. Robust synthesis methods employing several reducing agents have been the backbone of such enormous strides of Au and Ag NPs, allowing the delivery of much lower drug volumes to minimize the patient sensitization. Probes based on Au and Ag NPs functionalization with biocompatible chemical molecules have substantially improved their in vivo tracking and mediating a site-specific binding leading to improved cancer treatment with minimal risks to normal cells. With a better drug delivery potential of non-spherical shapes, the cylindrical (rod shaped) geometries have recently been investigated to possess higher cellular uptake. The rod shaped surface morphology enables a larger area for drug binding with enhanced possibility to make use of photothermal attributes. The interplay of size and shape dependent biologic activities is regulated by physicochemical changes in the tumor microenvironment, where stable drug-carrier binding is facilitated by surface modification of NPs, through moderate interactive forces ensuring minimal changes in native drug structure. The energy savvy greener methods, like microwave and microemulsions have enabled much better control on the synthesized nanoparticle shapes and geometries, through a regulation of precursor to reducing agent stoichiometries. With this viewpoint, this article focuses on most common synthesis methods of Au and Ag NPs alongside their application in more effective treatment of lung and breast cancers.

AB Paclitaxel (PTX), one of the most potent anticancer agents, has showed a remarkable activity against varieties of tumors. However, the bioavailability of PTX is quite low due to its poor aqueous solubility. Moreover, the emerging multidrug resistance (MDR) in cancer to PTX remains a major obstacle for successful chemotherapy. In order to address these problems, we developed self-assembly of biotinylated poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(curcumin) (Biotin-PEG-PCDA) for PTX delivery (termed as PTX-BPC NPs) with the application of mPEG(2K)-P(CL-coLLA) as an emulsifier. The loading content and encapsulation efficiency of PTX were 13.2% and 92.0%, respectively. In vitro drug release study showed that PTX-BPC NPs could degrade rapidly and then release the PTX payload in a 10 mM glutathione (GSH) environment. Compared with free PTX, PTX-BPC NPs exhibited enhanced anticancer efficacy (IC50(mcF-7/ADR cells), 17.28 mu g/mL vs. 1.15 mu g/mL). In addition, these biotin-modified nanoparticles could also significantly reverse PTX resistance by suppressing the over-expression of P-gp, thus resulting in increased intracellular drug accumulation and reduced drug efflux in MCF-7/ADR cells, which showed a great anticancer effect.

AB Nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) are biocompatible and biodegradable nanoscale systems with extensive application for controlled drug release. However, the development of optimal nanosystems along with a reproducible manufacturing process is still challenging. In this study, a two-step experimental design was performed and databases were successfully modelled using Artificial Intelligence techniques as an innovative method to get optimal, reproducible and stable NLC. The initial approach, including a wide range of values for the different variables, was followed by a second set of experiments with variable values in a narrower range, more suited to the characteristics of the system. NLC loaded with rifabutin, a hydrophobic drug model, were produced by hot homogenization and fully characterized in terms of particle size, size distribution, zeta potential, encapsulation efficiency and drug loading. The use of Artificial Intelligence tools has allowed to elucidate the key parameters that modulate each formulation property. Stable nanoparticles with low sizes and polydispersions, negative zeta potentials and high drug loadings were obtained when the proportion of lipid components, drug, surfactants and stirring speed were optimized by FormRules (R) and INForm (R). The successful application of Artificial Intelligence tools on NLC formulation optimization constitutes a pioneer approach in the field of lipid nanoparticles.

AB Plipastatin, a cyclic lipopeptide, exhibits inhibitory activity against filamentous fungi and plays an important role in the prevention of plant diseases, and post-harvest preservation of fruits and vegetables. However, the application of plipastatin has been hampered by low yields in natural strains, while chemical synthesis is not feasible because of its complex chemical structure. In this study, a scarless genetic modification method was applied to construct a heterologous expression host (Bacillus subtilis 1A751 Delta pps) by knocking out the natural plipastatin genes from B. subtilis strain 1A751. The core genes for plipastatin biosynthesis from B. amyloliquefaciens HYM12 were captured and assembled with sfp and degQ using transformation-associated recombination (TAR) cloning. The resultant gene cluster was introduced into B. subtilis 1A751 Delta pps to generate strain B. subtilis 1A751 Delta pps amyE::ppsA-E + sfp + degQ. Its fermentation products were analyzed and identified by high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry. The results showed that the gene cluster for plipastatin synthesis was expressed successfully. This is the first time three gene fragments with significantly different DNA sizes (38.4, 0.3 and 0.8 kb) have been assembled by the TAR technique, thus we simultaneously established a method to express recombined large fragments in B. subtilis.

AB The conjugation reaction of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with small-molecule drugs is a central step during production of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). The ability to monitor this step in real time can be advantageous for process understanding and control. Here, we propose a method based on UV/Vis spectroscopy in conjunction with partial least squares (PLS) regression for non-invasive monitoring of conjugation reactions. In experiments, the method was applied to conjugation reactions with two surrogate drugs in microplate format as well as at 20 ml scale. All calibrated PLS models performed well in cross-validation (Q(2) > 0.975 for all models). In microplate format, the PLS models were furthermore successfully validated with an independent prediction set (R-pred(2) = 0.9770 resp. 0.8940). In summary, the proposed method provides a quick and easily implementable tool for reaction monitoring of ADC conjugation reactions and may in the future support the implementation of Process Analytical Technologies (PAT).

AB RNA-guided endonuclease Cas9 derived from microbial CRISPR-Cas adaptive immune systems is a powerful tool for genome editing, which has been widely used in eukaryotic systems, prokaryotic systems, and plants. However, the off-target effects caused by Cas9/sgRNA remain a major concern. Currently, the efforts to reduce the off-target effects mainly focus on improving the targeting specificity of sgRNA/Cas9, regulating the activity of the Cas9 protein or the sgRNA, and controlling the time window of their expression. In this study, a novel system was established to regulate the post-transcriptional sgRNA level by small molecule-controlled aptazyme. This system was shown to reduce the off-target effects caused by Cas9/sgRNA, while enabling precise temporal control over gene editing and regulatory activity. This new system could provide a potentially safer and more powerful tool for genome editing and therapeutic application.

AB miRNAs are potent molecular regulators of cellular behaviour. The manipulation of these small non-coding RNAs has been used to enhance industrially relevant phenotypes in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. We investigated the stable depletion of six miRNAs; miR-204-5p, 338-3p, 378-3p, 409-3p, 455-3p and 505-3p, robustly associated with cell growth rate from a previous profiling study. Inhibition of endogenous miR-378-3p function by miRNA-sponge-decoy improved peak cell density by 59%. Quantitative label free LC-MS/MS proteomic analysis of the fractionated cell cultures at day 4 and 8 of batch culture found 216 cytosolic and 114 membrane-associated proteins differentially expressed with stable miR-378-3p depletion. qRT-PCR of 8 genes; Clic4, Hnrnpa1, Prdx1, Actn4, Usp14, Srxn1, Canx and Gnb1, with unidirectional differential protein expression over the two time points of analysis was carried out. In-silico predictive algorithms; TargetScan and miRDB, were used to decipher possible direct targets of miR-378-3p. The Ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase 14 (Usp14) protein was identified in the cytosolic fractions at both timepoints as differentially expressed with an increased abundance of 1.58-fold in the miR-378-3p depleted cells on day 8. Usp14 is a deubiquitinase (DUB) with previous reports of its up-regulation leading to increased proliferation of cancer cells. Overexpression of Usp14 in CHO cells had significant effects on cell growth supporting a role for Usp14 in the increased peak cell density seen with miR-378-3p depletion. This study highlights miR-378-3p as a novel engineering candidate for improving CHO cell growth. The use of subcellular fractionation also improved proteome coverage in the identification of novel miRNA targets.

AB Formation of disulfide bonds between heavy and light chains is challenge for production of recombinant immunoglobulin G (IgG) and fragment antigen-binding (Fab). Insufficient formation of the bond influences productive yield and quality of recombinant IgG and Fab. To investigate how amino acid sequences of the first heavy chain constant region (CH1) effect on assembly between heavy chain (VH-CH1 or Fd) and light chain (VL-CL), the CH1 gene sequence of an anti-paclitaxel fragment antigen-binding (anti-PT Fab IgG2a) was modified using the splicing by overlap extension-polymerase chain reaction (SOE-PCR) to be gene sequences encoding amino acid sequence of IgG1, IgG2b, and IgG3 subtypes. These anti-PT Fabs were expressed in Escherichia coli and silkworm larva expression systems. The efficiency of the assembly between VH-CH1 and VL-CL was evaluated. Based on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysis, assembly between heavy of IgG1 subtype and light chain was found to be superior over other subtypes using all tested expression systems. Furthermore, reactivity analysis using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) revealed that anti-PT Fab IgG1 subtype showed the highest reactivity against target compound paclitaxel. The folding efficiency and reactivity of the anti-PT Fab was influenced by CH1 amino acid sequence, which raises the possibility that this modification can be applied to improve recombinant Fab production.

AB Alternative separation methods operating in an aqueous environment are of increasing importance for further progress of molecular separation in life sciences and other industrial sectors working towards a biobased economy. By spincoating, membranes with thicknesses under 100 nm and 20 cm(2) surface area were prepared from an epoxy based resin. For the first time such ultrathin epoxy films were used for the selective separation of small molecules and metabolites within an aqueous environment. Initially, selectivity is demonstrated by the separation of two dyes of similar size (0.7 and 1.4 nm diameter). By variation of the precursor concentrations, both mechanical stability and selectivity for molecular transport are shown to be tunable. The observed transport properties of the different membranes correlated with their biaxial moduli and ultimate tensile strengths which were in the range of 0.3-3.5 GPa and 10-44 MPa, respectively. These observations agreed with the conclusion drawn from FTIR analysis that variations in the covalent crosslinking density determine the emergent properties. Finally, permeation rates for small molecules of industrial relevance were assessed to confirm a size based diffusion cutoff for compounds with hydrodynamic diameters below 2 nm.

AB Bacterial transformation is a fundamental technology to deliver engineered plasmids into bacterial cells, which is essential in industrial protein production, chemical production, etc. Previously, we developed a simple chemico-physical transformation method that can be applied to various bacterial species. Here, to accelerate the advance of bacteria biotechnology we optimize our method by combinatorially evaluating chemical compounds (rubidium chloride, lithium acetate, cesium chloride, dimethyl sulfoxide, and magnesium chloride) for increasing membrane permeability and nanomaterials (sepiolite, gold(III) chloride, multiwalled carbon nanotube, and chitosan) for piercing the membranes. The best transformation efficiencies were achieved as follows; 2.84 x 10(4) CFU/mu g DNA in Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactics (0.1M CsCl and gold(III) chloride), 3.60x10(4) CFU/mu g DNA in Enterococcus faecalis (1 M Li-acetate and MWCNT), 2.41 x 10(4) CFU/mu g DNA in Bacillus sp. (0.01 M RbCl and sepiolite), 3.49 x 10(4) CFU/mu g DNA (0.1M RbCl and gold(III) chloride) in Ralstonia eutropha (also known as Cupriavidus necator) and 8.78 x 10(4) CFU/mu g DNA (1 M RbCl and chitosan) in Methylomonas sp. DH-1. The efficiencies are up to 100-fold higher than those without optimization. Accordingly, our fast and simple chemico-physical transformation with chemical-nanomaterial optimization allows for the efficient DNA entry into various bacterial cells with high efficiency.

TI Sero-prevalence of rubella among pregnant women in India, 2017

LA English
DT Article
DE Rubella virus; Sero-prevalence; India
AB Background: We conducted a sero-survey among pregnant women attending antenatal clinics of six hospitals which also function as sentinel sites for CRS surveillance, to estimate the prevalence of IgG antibodies against rubella.
   Methods: We systematically sampled 1800 pregnant women attending antenatal clinics and tested their sera for IgG antibodies against rubella. We classified sera as seropositive (titre >= 10 IU/ml), sero-negative (titre <8 IU/ml) or indeterminate (titre 8-9.9 lU/mL) per manufacturer's instructions. In a sub-sample, we estimated the titers of IgG antibodies against rubella. IgG titer of >= 10 IU/mL was considered protective.
   Results: Of 1800 sera tested, 1502 (83.4%) were seropositive and 24 (1.3%) were indeterminate and 274 (15.2%) were sero-negative. Rubella sero-positivity did not differ by age group, educational status or place of residence. Three hundred and eighty three (87.8%) of the 436 sera had IgG concentrations >= 10 IU/mL.
   Conclusion: The results of the serosurvey indicate high levels of rubella sero-positivity in pregnant women. High sero-prevalence in the absence of routine childhood immunization indicates continued transmission of rubella virus in cities where sentinel sites are located. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The effectiveness of HPV vaccine against HSIL+ (pathologically diagnosed CIN2+) in the first cohort in Japan was investigated in 22,743 women aged 20 to 29 years (parts of national cervical cancer screening program of FY [fiscal year] 2015, the Japan Cancer Society). Vaccinated women had a statistically significant 69% lower risk of HSIL+ as compared to the unvaccinated women; the crude relative risk estimate was 0.31 (95% CI: 0.11-0.83; p-value = 0.013) by normal approximation and 0.31 (95% Cl: 0.08-0.80; p-value = 0.009) by the exact Poisson regression. The effect of age was not significant (chisq = 7.7 (df = 9), p-value = 0.569) and the estimate of relative risk remained essentially intact after adjustment for age. This study brings scientific evidence on the effectiveness of HPV vaccine on development of cervical high grade lesions. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Passive immunisation with immunoglobulins as post-exposure prophylaxis after contact with measles is recommended by the German Standing Committee on Vaccination (STIKO) particularly for unprotected individuals at high risk of complications for whom active immunization is contraindicated, such as infants <6 months of age, immunocompromised patients and pregnant women. The efficacy of passive immunisation in preventing measles depends on how soon after exposure it is administered, the concentration of measles antibodies in the immunoglobulin products and dosage. Since the global introduction of standard active immunisation against measles and the concomitant reduction in virus circulation, the levels of measles virus (MV)-specific IgG antibodies in the population have dropped. Thus, the concentration of MV-specific antibodies in immunoglobulin products derived from human plasma donors has declined as the proportion of vaccinated donors has increased. The MV-neutralizing capacity of immunoglobulin products is not routinely tested in Germany. No official data exist on the concentrations of MV-specific IgG antibodies in individual batches of immunoglobulins available in Germany and the required minimum level for MV-specific IgG is not stipulated.
   The STIKO re-evaluated available data and measurements of MV-neutralizing capacities of available immunoglobulin (IgG) products in Germany at the National Reference Centre Measles, Mumps, Rubella at the Robert Koch Institute. Based on the findings, STIKO modified its previous recommendations on the post-exposure use of immunoglobulins (2001), especially with respect to risk groups, application and dosage. STIKO now recommends a single intravenous administration of immunoglobulins (400 mg/kg body weight) as soon as possible, preferably within six days, after exposure to measles, specifically for infants aged <6 months, susceptible pregnant women and immunocompromised patients.

AB Background: eHealth interventions may help increase vaccination uptake and health literacy related to immunization and improve immunization program efficiency.
   Objectives: To see where and how eHealth technologies have had a positive impact on immunization practices using eHealth strategies to increase vaccination uptake, improve immunization program efficiency and advance heath literacy related to immunizations.
   Methods: An overview of systematic reviews was conducted, searching PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science for systematic reviews published through August 2017 for eHealth and immunizations (using pre-determined concepts for each). Two independent reviewers selected studies based on a priori criteria; disagreement was resolved by consensus. The quality of the included studies was evaluated using the Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR).
   Results: The primary search identified 198 results. After eliminating duplicates 158 remained. Upon applying the a priori set criteria to these, six articles were left to analyze. Four articles showed a positive relationship (a demonstrated benefit, improvement, increase in vaccination uptake, etc. when using eHealth technologies for immunization), one showed a promising relation / with potential, and one showed unknown effects as it focused on the difficulty of analyzing cost-benefits of immunization information systems (IIS).
   Conclusion: The review leads to a recommendation of using eHealth technologies to encourage immunizations and increase vaccination adherence and uptake and to continue assessing and documenting the use of eHealth for immunization. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The immunological enhancement characteristics of the immunopotentiator CVC1302 were evaluated for foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) inactivated vaccine in pigs. Eight-week-old piglets were vaccinated with the foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) vaccine alone (FMD-vaccine group) or with the addition of CVC1302 (FMD-CVC1302 group), and the serum liquid phase blocking ELISA (LPB-ELISA) antibody titers, IgG1 and IgG2 levels, and the levels of four cytokines secreted by peripheral blood lymphocytes were measured at 28 days post vaccination (dpv). In the FMD-CVC1302 group, the LPB-ELISA antibody titers, IgG1, and IgG2 titers, and IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, and IFN-gamma levels at 28 dpv were significantly higher than those in the FMD-vaccine group. The FMD-CVC1302 group had long-lasting antibody titers (>7.8 log(2)), lasting for at least 6 months. In addition, piglets were vaccinated with or without addition of CVC1302 to the FMD vaccine at three different doses (1, 1/3, and 1/9 of the standard vaccine dose) and the serum LPBELISA antibody and serum neutralizing (SN) antibody titers were detected at 28 dpv. Then all pigs were challenged with virulent FMDV for PD50 value, and the levels of FMDV-specific RNA copies for the two full-dose groups at 3 and 10 days post challenge (dpc) were measured. The LPB-ELISA and SN antibody titers for the three doses in the FMD-CVC1302 groups were significantly higher than those in the FMD-vaccine groups at the same doses (p < 0.05). Post-virus challenge, the FMDV-specific RNA copy number in the FMD-CVC1302 group was lower than that in the FMD-vaccine group at 3 and 10 dpc. The PD50 value was 15.85 for the FMD-CVC1302 group, which was obviously higher than that for the FMD-vaccine group (10.96), and in the 1/9-dose of FMD-vaccine group only 3/5 pigs were protected. These results indicate that CVC1302 can enhance the immune efficacy and protective ability of the FMD vaccine in pigs. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: In Russia as in other countries introduction of infant vaccination against pertussis in 1950s led to dramatic decrease of whooping cough. The current vaccination schedule includes a 3-dose infant series and toddler booster; the pre-school booster was cancelled in 1980s and never reintroduced. Whole-cell vaccines, and in a smaller proportion acellular vaccines are used for all doses. However, pertussis incidence in urban settings is high with highest burden in school children. We conducted a study of seroprevalence of recent pertussis infection to estimate the duration of protection from the 4-dose series.
   Materials and methods: Sera sample from 395 St Petersburg children aged >= 3 years and <14 years were tested for pertussis toxin antibodies using a commercial PT ELISA test. Only children with completed 4-dose vaccination course were included in the study. Age-specific seroprevalence of recent pertussis infection was analyzed for trends.
   Results: Children fully vaccinated against pertussis at 3 years old had significant delays in infant vaccination schedule: only 83.5% received at least one dose of pertussis vaccine at 6 months of age and 25.6% received their toddler booster before 24 months-old. Overall, 10.6% of children demonstrated the serological signs of the infection in the last 12 months. A clear trend (r(2) = 0.692) of increasing proportion of infection in the last 12 months was observed in children who had received their last dose of vaccine 6 years and more prior to the study.
   Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that Russian children become susceptible to infection at or soon after entering school. The results confirm the waning of vaccine-elicited immunity around school-age and support the need for a booster dose at that age. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: A heat-stable bovine-human rotavirus reassortant pentavalent vaccine (BRV-PV, ROTASIIL (R)) was developed in India. In this study, the vaccine was tested for safety, immunogenicity and clinical lotto-lot consistency.
   Methods: This was a Phase III, open label, randomized, equivalence design study. The primary objective was to demonstrate lot-to-lot consistency of BRV-PV. Subjects were randomized into four arms, three arms received Lots A, B, and C of BRV-PV and the control arm, received Rotarix (R) . Three doses of BRVPV or two doses of Rotarix (R) and one dose of placebo were given at 6, 10, and 14 weeks of age. Blood samples were collected four weeks after the third dose to assess rotavirus IgA antibody levels. The three lots of BRV-PV were equivalent if the 95% Confidence Intervals (Cis) of the geometric mean concentration (GMC) ratios were between 0.5 and 2. Solicited reactions were collected by using diary cards.
   Results: The study was conducted in 1500 randomized infants, of which 1341 infants completed the study. The IgA GMC ratios among the three lots were around 1 (Lot A versus Lot B: 1.07; Lot A versus Lot C: 1.06; and Lot B versus Lot C: 0.99). The 95% Cls for the GMC ratios were between 0.78 and 1.36. The IgA GMCs were: BRV-PV group 19.16 (95% CI 17.37-21.14) and Rotarix (R) group 10.92 (95% CI 9.36-12.74) (GMC ratio 1.75; 90% CI 1.51-2.04). Seropositivity rates were 46.98% (95% CI 43.86-50.11) and 31.12% (95% CI 26.17-36.41). The incidence of solicited reactions was comparable across the four arms. No serious adverse events were associated with the study vaccines, except two gastroenteritis events in the BRV-PV groups.
   Conclusion: Lot-to-lot consistency of BRV-PV was demonstrated in terms of GMC ratios of IgA antibodies. The vaccine safety and immunogenicity profiles were similar to those of Rotarix (R). (C) 2018 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID COMMUNITY POPULATIONS
AB Background: A big pertussis outbreak occurred in a primary school with high vaccination coverage in northern China. An investigation was carried out in order to calculate the attack rate and identify the risk factors.
   Methods: Between May 12 and July 29, an investigation was carried out in the primary school, which included 383 students and 27 teachers. Three definitions were used to distinguish the cases: confirmed, epidemiologically linked and suspected cases. A total of 232 blood samples were collected and examined by ELISA among healthy children in another primary school.
   Results: A total of 138 suspected pertussis cases were counted, of which 116 students were confirmed. The attack rate among students was as high as 30.29%. The pertussis outbreak lasted 88 days, and had quaternary cases of transmission. Migrant children were almost four times as likely to catch the disease as local children (p = 0.005). In addition, students who had received the last dose of pertussis vaccine more than 4 years prior were three times more likely of becoming ill than those less than 4 years (p = 0.006). The average level of antibodies to pertussis was 30.99 IU/ml among healthy children. No statistically significant difference was observed between DTaP and DTwP (p = 0.843).
   Conclusions: This pertussis outbreak in a primary school with high vaccination coverage was an evidence of the pertussis resurgence in China. The major risk factor we identified was the waning of immunity in the years after pertussis vaccination. Booster vaccination for students should be given. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Among all post-marketing medication error reports submitted to EudraVigilance, vaccines are the most frequently reported medicinal products. This study aims to describe the characteristics of vaccination errors submitted to Eudravigilance between 2001 and 2016.
   Methods: EudraVigilance is a spontaneous reporting database for adverse events maintained by the European Medicines Agency. We extracted Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs) submitted to EudraVigilance between 1 January 2001 and 31 December 2016. Reports were included for analysis if a vaccine was reported as interacting or suspect drug and at least one medication error term was listed as an adverse reaction. ICSRs were stratified by age and gender, by year of reporting, region of origin, reporter profession, seriousness of outcome, ATC, and type of error.
   Results: In total, 7097 ICSRs were included in the study. We observed a yearly increase in the reporting of vaccination errors, with the proportion to all vaccine ICSRs increasing from 0.4% to 4.0% between 2001 and 2016. The majority of reports was classified as serious (4248, 59.9%), but non-serious reports were increasingly reported since 2012. The mean age of patients was 24.1 years. The most frequently reported vaccines were influenza (13.5%), bacterial and viral combined (12.3%), and hepatitis vaccines (11.8%). A total of 8167 medication error terms were reported. The most frequently reported terms were "Inappropriate schedule of drug administration" (27.2%), "Incorrect route of drug administration" (12.5%) and "Drug administered to patient of inappropriate age" (10.0%). For infants and children, the error "Drug administered to patient of inappropriate age" was reported more often than for all other age categories.
   Discussion: Vaccination errors are increasingly submitted to EudraVigilance. Errors related to the schedule are the most common errors reported with vaccines. However, consequences of vaccination errors appear to be relatively mild. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: The benefits of childhood vaccines are critically dependent on vaccination coverage. We used a vaccine registry (as gold standard) in Kenya to quantify errors in routine coverage methods (surveys and administrative reports), to estimate the magnitude of survivor bias, contrast coverage with timeliness and use both measures to estimate population immunity.
   Methods: Vaccination records of children in the Kilifi Health and Demographic Surveillance System (KHDSS), Kenya were combined with births, deaths, migration and residence data from 2010 to 17. Using inverse survival curves, we estimated up-to-date and age-appropriate vaccination coverage, calculated mean vaccination coverage in infancy as the area under the inverse survival curves, and estimated the proportion of fully immunised children (FIC). Results were compared with published coverage estimates. Risk factors for vaccination were assessed using Cox regression models.
   Results: We analysed data for 49,090 infants and 48,025 children aged 12-23 months in 6 birth cohorts and 6 cross-sectional surveys respectively, and found 2nd year of life surveys overestimated coverage by 2% compared to birth cohorts. Compared to mean coverage in infants, static coverage at 12 months was exaggerated by 7-8% for third doses of oral polio, pentavalent (Penta3) and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, and by 24% for the measles vaccine. Surveys and administrative coverage also underestimated the proportion of the fully immunised child by 10-14%. For BCG, Penta3 and measles, timeliness was 23-44% higher in children born in a health facility but 20-37% lower in those who first attended during vaccine stock outs.
   Conclusions: Standard coverage surveys in 12-23 month old children overestimate protection by ignoring timeliness, and survivor and recall biases. Where delayed vaccination is common, up-to-date coverage will give biased estimates of population immunity. Surveys and administrative methods also underestimate FIC prevalence. Better measurement of coverage and more sophisticated analyses are required to control vaccine preventable diseases. (C) 2018 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this study, we isolated and identified an infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV) that was naturally avirulent in specific pathogen-free (SPF) chickens, with the aim of developing a more efficacious vaccine against ILTV and Newcastle disease virus (NDV). We constructed a US9-deleted ILTV mutant based on this avirulent ILTV, and then constructed a recombinant ILTV (designated ILTV-Delta US9-F) expressing the fusion protein (F) of the genotype VII NDV based on the US9-deleted ILTV mutant. Expression of the F protein in ILTV-Delta US9-F-infected cells was confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence assay and western blotting. The inserted F gene was stably expressed in ILTV-Delta US9-F. The growth kinetics of ILTV-Delta US9-F were comparable to those of the wild-type ILTV strain. Vaccination of SPF chickens with ILTV-Delta US9-F produced no clinical signs but did induce low levels of NDV-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and neutralizing antibodies. A single vaccination with 10(4) plaque-forming units (PFU) of ILTV-Delta US9-F provided good protection against both genotype VII and IX NDVs based on clinical signs, similar to the protection provided by the commercial live La Sota vaccine. Notably, ILTV-Delta US9-F limited the replication and shedding of genotype VII NDV from oropharyngeal swabs more efficiently than the La Sota vaccine. In addition, vaccination with lower doses (10(3) and 10(2) PFU) of ILTV-Delta US9-F also provided sufficient clinical protection. These results indicated that ILTV-Delta US9-F may be a bivalent vaccine candidate against both ILTV and NDV. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Influenza vaccination among adults living with persons at high-risk for
   complications from influenza during early 2016-17 influenza season
SO VACCINE
LA English
DT Article
DE Influenza vaccination; High-risk household contact
AB Background: The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends all persons aged >= 6 months get vaccinated for influenza annually, placing particular emphasis on persons who are at increased risk for influenza-related complications and persons living with or caring for them.
   Methods: Data from the 2016 National Internet Flu Survey (NIFS), a nationally representative, probability-based Internet panel survey of the noninstitutionalized U.S. civilian population aged >= 18 years, was used to compare influenza vaccination coverage among adults who live with household members at high-risk for complications from influenza with those who do not. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the difference in the adjusted vaccination coverage prevalence between persons living with and without high-risk household members.
   Results: From the 2016 NIFS (n = 4,113), we estimated that 29.2% of noninstitutionalized U.S. adults had at least one household member at increased risk for influenza-related complications. Unadjusted influenza vaccination coverage was significantly higher for adults with a high-risk household member compared with those without (46.7% vs 38.6%, respectively). After adjustment for demographic and accessto-care factors, adults with high-risk household members were more likely to be vaccinated than those without (adjusted prevalence difference = 5.3 [0.3, 10.3]). Among vaccinated respondents with high-risk household members, 88.7% reported that protection of their family and close contacts was one of the reasons they were vaccinated.
   Conclusion: Approximately half of adults living with someone at increased risk of complications from influenza did not report receiving an influenza vaccination. Vaccination reminder/recall for persons at increased risk should include reminders for their household contacts. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Serotypes/genotypes causing invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in adults are determined by vaccination strategies. The aim of this study was to assess the epidemiology of IPD in adults (>= 18 years) after PCV13 introduction for children: serotypes, clonal complexes, antibiotic non-susceptibility and clinical presentations.
   We performed a prospective, clinical surveillance of hospitalized culture-confirmed IPDs in adults in nine Spanish hospitals (August 2010-June 2015). A total of 1087 culture-confirmed IPD episodes were included, of which 772 (71.0%) had bacteremic pneumonia (401 complicated/371 uncomplicated pneumonia), 122 (11.2%) meningitis, 102 (9.4%) non-focal bacteremia, 34 (3.1%) peritonitis and 57 (5.3%) others. The most common serotypes were: 3 (12.7%), 19A (8.5%), 8 (7.7%), 7F (6.3%), 1 (4.2%), 6C (4.2%), 11A (4.2%), 22F (4.2%) and 14 (4.0%). Vaccine types (PCV13 + 6C) caused 49.8% of IPD episodes, with a significant decrease over the 5-year period, and significant decreases in serotypes 6C and 7F. The most common genotypes were: CC180 (8.4%), CC191 (6.0%), and CC53 (5.0%).
   Vaccine types caused 53.9% (414/768) pneumonia episodes and 58.9% (235/399) complicated pneumonia, 53.4% IPD in adults <50 years (143/268), and 54.7% IPD in immunocompetent patients (337/616). Overall non-susceptibility was 25.9% to penicillin (1.1% for parenteral criteria), 24.9% to erythromycin and 2.7% to levofloxacin.
   Conclusions: Although the percentage of vaccine-types causing IPDs in adults significantly decreased, it remained high. Associations of vaccine types with pneumonia (with complicated pneumonia for specific serotypes), and immunocompetent patients point to the burden of IPD caused by PCV13 serotypes.

ID SIGMA-C PROTEIN; PROTECTION; STRAIN
AB The Muscovy duck reovirus (MDRV) is a highly pathogenic virus that causes substantial economic losses in the Muscovy duck industry. While MDRV poses a significant threat to Muscovy ducklings, no vaccine candidates are available to date to alleviate MDRV infection throughout the world. The present study presents efforts toward establishing an attenuated vaccine for MDRV. For this purpose, a live attenuated vaccine strain named CA was obtained via alternate propagation of the MDRV isolate MW9710 in both Muscovy duck embryo fibroblasts (MDEFs) and chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEFs) for 90 passages. The CA strain achieved an adaptive growth capacity in CEFs with a viral titer that ranged between 10(5.5) TCID50/100 mu L and lost its pathogenicity in 1-day-old Muscovy ducklings. Compared to the parent strain MW9710, the CA strain has 42 scattered amino acid substitutions, most of which are located in the lambda B, lambda C, mu B,sigma B and sigma C protein. The CA strain maintained its attenuation and showed no gene mutation or virulence reversion after back propagation into 1-day-old ducklings for five rounds. The minimum protective dose was calculated to be 300 TCID50 of the CA strain. Furthermore, a single dose of CA vaccine protected immunized ducklings against lethal challenge by the virulent MDRV strain MW9710 and significantly decreased viral loads. In summary, the CA strain exhibited striking genetic stability, excellent safety, and effective immunogenicity. This CA strain of MDRV is a promising vaccine candidate for the prevention and control of MDRV infection. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We previously reported the development of an oral vaccine for diabetes based on live attenuated Salmonella-expressing preproinsulin (PPI) as the autoantigen. When combined with host cell-expressed TGF beta, the vaccine prevented the onset of diabetes in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice. Herein, we investigated factors that could affect vaccine efficacy including vaccination number, optimization of the autoantigen codon sequence, Salmonella SPI2-TTSS promoter/effector combinations, concurrent short-course low-dose anti-CD3. We also evaluated autoantigen GAD65 and cytokine IL10 treatment upon vaccine efficacy. T-cells we employed to elucidate the mechanism of the vaccine action. Our results showed that GAD65+TGF beta or PPI+TGF beta+IL10 prevented the onset of diabetes in the NOD mice and maintained glucose tolerance. However, increasing the number of vaccine doses, codon-optimization of the autoantigen(s) or use of other Salmonella promoter/effector combinations had no in vivo effect. Interestingly, two doses of vaccine (PPI+TGF beta+IL10) combined with a sub-therapeutic dose of anti-CD3 prevented diabetes and decreased hyperglycemia in mice. The combined therapy also increased splenic Tregs and local Tregs in pancreatic lymph nodes (PLN) and increased regulatory (IL10 and IL2) but reduced inflammatory (IFN gamma and TNF alpha) cytokines. Together, these results indicate that the combination of low vaccine dose number, less vaccine autoantigen expression and short-course low-dose anti-CD3 can increase regulatory mechanisms and suppress autoimmunity.

AB Invasive meningococcal disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis is a life-threatening disease. Several countries now include meningococcal serogroup C (MenC) conjugate and, more recently, a meningococcal serogroup ACWY conjugate (MenACWY) vaccination in their national immunization schedules. DTaP-IPV-HB-PRP-T is a hexavalent vaccine that provides protection against six diseases. The phase III, open-label, randomised, multicentre study enrolled healthy toddlers who received the DTaP-IPV-HB-PRP-T vaccine (at 2,3 and 4 months) with or without a MenC vaccine (at 2 and 4 months) in the primary series study. At 12 months of age, 312 toddlers were randomised to receive DTaP-IPV-HB-PRP-T co-administered with MenACWY-TT vaccine (Group A; n = 104); DTaP-IPV-HB-PRP-T vaccine alone (Group B; n = 105); or MenACWY-TT vaccine alone (Group C; n = 103). At 12 months of age, there were no notable differences in terms of antibody persistence for any DTaP-IPV-HB-PRP-T vaccine antigen, whether MenC-TT conjugate vaccine was co-administered or not during the primary series. Following booster vaccination, immune responses to DTaP-IPV-HB-PRP-T and MenACWY-TT vaccines were not affected by co-administration. One month after vaccination, the immune responses elicited by both vaccines were high, whether administered concomitantly or separately. The administration of MenC vaccine during infancy did not preclude the use of a MenACWY-TT vaccine for booster vaccination. Even though the reactogenicity after co-administration was somewhat higher, the results of this study support the concomitant administration of the DTaP-IPV-HB-PRP-T vaccine with a MenACWY-TT conjugate vaccine when given from 12 months of age.

AB Cell-mediated immunity is an important component of immediate and long-term anti-viral protection. Dendritic cells (DCs) are essential for the induction of cell-mediated immunity by instructing the activation and differentiation of antigen-specific T cell responses. Activated DCs that express co-stimulatory molecules and pro-inflammatory cytokines are necessary to promote the development of type 1 immune responses required for viral control. Here we report that plant-derived virus-like particles (VLPs) bearing influenza hemagglutinins (HA) directly stimulate mouse and human DCs. DCs exposed to H1- and, to a lesser extent, H5-VLPs in vitro rapidly express co-stimulatory molecules and produce proinflammatory cytokines including IL-12, IL-6 and TNF alpha. Furthermore, these VLPs support the activation and differentiation of antigen-specific T cell responses. Mechanistically, H1-VLPs stimulate the activation of kinases typically activated downstream of pattern recognition receptors including AKT, p38, and p42/44 ERK. In vivo, immunization with plant-derived VLPs induce the accumulation of both cDC1s and cDC2 in the draining lymph node and a corresponding increase in T and B cells. VLPs devoid of HA protein activate DCs, suggesting they are intrinsically immunostimulatory. Together, the results demonstrate that these candidate plant-derived VLP vaccines have an inherent and direct stimulatory effect on DCs and can enhance the ability of DCs to promote Type 1 immune responses.

AB Background: To address a high incidence of serogroup B invasive meningococcal disease (IMD-B) in the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region, Quebec, Canada, a mass vaccination campaign targeting nearly 60,000 individuals <= 20 years old was launched in May 2014. Because of the limited clinical experience with the four-component meningococcal B vaccine (4CMenB), active surveillance for adverse events following immunization (AEFI) was conducted. This paper reports 4CMenB AEFI surveillance findings.
   Methods: Active surveillance assessed AEFIs with acute onset within 7-days post-immunization, AEFI-associated absenteeism and medical consultations, impact of antipyretic prophylaxis and coadministration of other vaccines.
   Results: By July 17, 2015, 83% and 77% of the 59,098 individuals targeted by the campaign had received a first and a second dose of 4CMenB. The incidence of fever on days1-2 was highest in children <2 years old but only 0.6% reported a temperature >= 40 degrees C. Among children <10 years old, >= 2doses of acetaminophen prophylaxis significantly reduced fever incidence on days1-2 after dose1&2. Absenteeism or a medical consultation during the 7 days following vaccination was reported by 6.2% of vaccinees post-dose1 and 9.2% post-dose2 and was most often reported in association with fever/malaise (4.2%) or injection site reactions (3.6%).
   Conclusion: Large-scale population-based surveillance identified a 7-day reactogenicity profile consistent with earlier clinical trials with the 4CMenB vaccine but indicating frequent AEFI-associated absenteeism and medical consultations affecting the societal cost of this vaccine. We conclude acceptable vaccine safety and risk-benefit profile overall on the short term, particularly as an intervention to address a high regional incidence of IMD-B. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Annual influenza vaccination has been recommended for persons with high-risk conditions since the 1960s. However, few estimates of influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) for persons with high-risk conditions are available.
   Methods: Data from the U.S. Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network from 2012 to 2016 were analyzed to compare VE of standard-dose inactivated vaccines against medically-attended influenza among patients aged >= 6 months with and without high-risk medical conditions. Patients with acute respiratory illness were tested for influenza by RT-PCR. Presence of high-risk conditions and vaccination status were obtained from medical records. VE by influenza virus type/subtype and age group was calculated for patients with and without high-risk conditions using the test-negative design. Interaction terms were used to test for differences in VE by high-risk conditions.
   Results: Overall, 9643 (38%) of 25,369 patients enrolled during four influenza seasons had high-risk conditions; 2213 (23%) tested positive for influenza infection. For all ages, VE against any influenza was lower among patients with high-risk conditions (41%, 95% CI: 35-47%) than those without (48%, 95% CI: 43-52%; P-for-interaction = 0.02). For children aged <18 years, VE against any influenza was 51% (95% CI: 39-61%) and 52% (95% CI: 39-61%) among those with and without high-risk conditions, respectively (P-for-interaction = 0.54). For adults aged >= 18 years, VE against any influenza was 38% (95% CI: 30-45%) and 44% (95% CI: 38-50%) among those with and without high-risk conditions, respectively (P-for-interaction = 0.21). For both children aged <18 and adults aged >= 18 years, VEs against illness related to influenza A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, and influenza B virus infection were similar among those with and without high-risk conditions.
   Conclusions: Influenza vaccination provided protection against medically-attended influenza among patients with high-risk conditions, at levels approaching those observed among patients without high-risk conditions. Results from our analysis support recommendations of annual vaccination for patients with high-risk conditions. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: In the United States, seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) is recommended for pregnant women; however, in early 2009, immunization rates were low, partly due to limited prospective data and concerns about vaccine safety.
   Objective: We conducted a randomized study of two licensed seasonal trivalent IIVs (IIV3) to assess their safety and immunogenicity in pregnant women.
   Study Design: In this prospective, randomized clinical study, 100 pregnant women, 18-39 years of age and >= 14 weeks gestation received a single intramuscular dose of 2008-2009 Fluzone (R) or Fluarix (R). Injection site and systemic reactions were recorded for 7 days after vaccination and serious adverse events (SAEs) and pregnancy outcomes were documented. Serum samples collected before and 28 days after vaccination were tested for hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) antibody levels.
   Results: The majority of the injection site and systemic reactions were mild and self-limited after both vaccines. No fever >= 100 degrees F was reported. There were no vaccine-associated SAEs. Immune responses to influenza vaccine antigens were similar for the two study vaccines, with robust HAI responses against influenza A strains, and relatively lower responses for influenza B strains.
   Conclusion: Seasonal inactivated influenza vaccines were well tolerated and immunogenic in pregnant women. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Immunization has a significant impact in protecting from severe diseases. Various factors that could influence child immunization coverage and parents' decisions about vaccinating their children should be further explored in specific population groups.
   Objectives: The current study has two main objectives: to assess the main information sources that affect parental decisions to vaccinate their children and to measure the extent to which these factors differ demographically by exploring the opinions and attitudes within four main population groups in Israel: ultra-Orthodox Jews, all other Jews, non-Bedouin Arabs, and Bedouins.
   Methods: 1504 parents, with similar representation among four main population groups, participated in this study. A structured, anonymous, self-administered questionnaire was used.
   Results: The most influential source on parents' decisions to vaccinate their children was the nurse at Mother and Child Health Clinics (MCHCs). Positive attitudes were shown regarding the key role of immunization in preventing severe diseases, while the most important concern expressed was the potential pain to the child while being vaccinated (rather than the safety of the vaccine). Higher compliance rates were reported among participants with a non-academic education level (chi(2) = 12.21, p <0.001), an average level of income (chi(2) = 26.66, p <0.001), and a greater level of religiosity (chi(2) = 5.13, p <0.01). Multivariate analysis showed that higher reliance on Ministry of Health publications (OR= 2.24, 95% CI = 1.49-3.35) and a belief that vaccinations prevent severe diseases (OR =1.55, 95% CI = 1.06-2.25) predicted higher vaccination compliance. A concern about unsafe components of the vaccinations predicted lower compliance (OR = 0.41, 95% CI = 0.25-0.66). Bedouins demonstrated the highest compliance rate (99%), were most influenced by all information sources, and demonstrated the most pro-vaccination positions.
   Conclusions: The factor that most influenced Israeli parents' decisions to vaccinate their children was their degree of trust in information sources about vaccinations, particularly the nurses at the MCHCs. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of severe lower respiratory tract infections in newborns, young children, elderly, and immune-compromised. The RSV fusion (F) glycoprotein is a major focus of vaccine development and the target of palivizumab (Synagis (R)) which is licensed as an immuno-prophylactic for use in newborn children at high risk of infection. However, clinical use of a narrowly targeted monoclonal antibodies leads to the generation of escape mutant strains that are fully resistant to neutralization by the antibody. Herein, we evaluated the RSV F nanoparticle vaccine (RSV F vaccine), produced as near-full-length, pre-fusogenic F trimers that form stable protein-detergent nanoparticles. The RSV F vaccine induces polyclonal antibodies that bind to antigenic site II as well as other epitopes known to be broadly neutralizing. Cotton rats immunized with the RSV F vaccine produced antibodies that were both neutralizing and protected against wild-type RSV infection, as well as against a palivizumab-resistant mutant virus. Use of aluminum phosphate adjuvant with the RSV F vaccine increased site II antibody avidity 100 to 1000-fold, which correlated with enhanced protection against challenge. The breadth of the vaccine-induced antibody response was demonstrated using competitive binding with monoclonal antibodies targeting antigenic sites empty set, II, IV, and VIII found on pre-fusion and post-fusion conformations of RSV F. In summary, we found the RSV F vaccine induced antibodies that bind to conserved epitopes including those defined as pre-fusion F specific; that use of adjuvant increased antibody avidity that correlated with enhanced protection in the cotton rat challenge model; and the polyclonal, high-avidity antibodies neutralized and protected against both wild-type and palivizumabresistant mutant virus. These data support the ongoing clinical development of the aluminum phosphate adjuvanted RSV F nanoparticle vaccine. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae is the causative agent of animal erysipelas and human erysipeloid. Bacterial surface proteins are promising vaccine candidates. We recently identified 3 E. rhusiopathiae surface proteins (GAPDH, HP0728, and HP1472) and characterized their roles as virulence factors. However, their efficacy as protective antigens is still unknown. The N-terminal region of a previously identified surface protein, CbpB (CbpB-N), is speculated to be a protective antigen, but this needs to be verified. The aim of this study was to evaluate the protective efficacy of GAPDH, HP0728, HP1472, and CbpB-N. Immunization with recombinant GAPDH provided complete protection in a mouse model, recombinant CbpB-N provided partial protection, while recombinant HP0728 and HP1472 provided no protection. Recombinant GAPDH also provided good protection in a pig model. GAPDH antiserum exhibited significant blood bactericidal activity against E. rhusiopathiae. In conclusion, GAPDH and CbpB-N were found to be protective antigens of E. rhusiopathiae, and GAPDH is a promising vaccine candidate. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Background incidence rates (IRs) of potential safety outcomes among vaccine eligible individuals can inform assessment of vaccine safety. Vaccine safety surveillance often uses claims databases, but the impact of outcome definitions on background IR estimates is largely unexplored. Using two definitions for each outcome, we estimated background IRs of 32 cardiac, metabolic, allergic, autoimmune, neurologic, hematologic and nephrologic outcomes among individuals eligible to receive pneumococcal vaccination.
   Methods: We defined a cohort of individuals aged 6-100 years in US commercial health plans who had >= 12 months of health plan enrollment between January 2007 and August 2014 and no previous record of conjugate or simple polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccination. We developed a sensitive and a specific definition for each outcome, with the specific definition requiring evidence of additional care consistent with the outcome. IRs per 100,000 person-years for each outcome were presented overall and stratified by age, gender, and invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) risk category.
   Results: We followed 19.9 million individuals for a median of 2.5 years. Wide variation was seen in IRs across different definitions of the 32 outcomes, with 19 (59%) outcomes having a specific definition IR less than half of the sensitive definition IR. IRs were particularly variable by definition for outcomes categorized as either hematologic/nephrologic or neurologic (mean ratio of specific IR to sensitive IR = 0.26 and 0.30, respectively). Across definitions, the IRs of the 32 outcomes were often highest in females, adults >= 65, and those at higher IPD risk.
   Conclusions: Background IRs of safety outcomes relevant to populations indicated for pneumococcal vaccine varied by outcome definitions and population subgroups in this large US commercially-insured population. Given large differences in estimated IRs using sensitive versus specific case definitions, neurologic, and hematologic/nephrologic safety outcomes as compared to allergic and autoimmune outcomes may warrant more refined definitions and medical record validation.

AB To describe hepatitis A virus (HAV) seroprevalence and associated factors in adolescents (10-19 years) and young adults (20-25 years) in different Mexican regions, using 2012 National Health and Nutrition Survey data. A random selection of 1581 serum samples was analyzed. Weighted HAV seroprevalence with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) and its association with sociodemographic factors were estimated. Mean weighted HAV seroprevalence was 69.3% (95%CI: 64.8-73.4) overall, with 58.8% (95%CI: 53.4-64.1) in adolescents and 83.0% (95%CI: 75.3-88.7) in young adults. By age of 10, 46.7% (95%0: 33.9-60.0) were seropositive and by age of 15, 52.8% (95%CI: 36.5-68.5), corresponding to intermediate endemicity nationally. Factors associated with HAV seropositivity (adjusted odds ratio, aOR) included: lower socioeconomic status (SES) (aOR = 4.09 for low and aOR = 2.31 for medium versus high SES), older age (aOR = 0.29 for adolescents versus young adults), living in the South (aOR = 2.12 versus Central Mexico) or in rural areas (aOR = 2.25 versus urban areas). Regional differences and increased seroprevalence of HAV in marginalized populations present an important public health issue, as a relatively large proportion of young adults are susceptible to infection. The burden of symptomatic disease must be addressed further to support specific programs of continued sanitation and education improvement, and the possibility of vaccination in more susceptible regions.

AB Background: Early RSV illness is associated with wheeze-associated disorders in childhood. Candidate respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccines may prevent acute RSV illness in infants. We investigated the feasibility of maternal RSV vaccine trials to demonstrate reductions in recurrent childhood wheezing in general paediatric populations.
   Methods: We calculated vaccine trial effect sizes that depended on vaccine efficacy, allocation ratio, rate of early severe RSV illness, risk of recurrent wheezing at age 3, and increased risk of RSV infection on recurrent wheezing. Model inputs came from systematic reviews and meta-analyses. For each combination of inputs, we estimated the sample size required to detect the effect of vaccination on recurrent wheezing.
   Results: There were 81 scenarios with 1:1 allocation ratio. Risk ratios between vaccination and recurrent wheezing ranged from 0.9 to 1.0 for 70% of the scenarios. Among the 57 more plausible scenarios, the lowest sample size required to detect significant reductions in recurrent wheezing was 6196 mother-infant pairs per trial arm; however, 75% and 47% of plausible scenarios required >31,060 and >100,000 mother-infant pairs per trial arm, respectively. Studies with asthma endpoints at age 5 will likely need to be larger.
   Discussion: Clinical efficacy trials of candidate maternal RSV vaccines undertaken for licensure are unlikely to demonstrate an effect on recurrent wheezing illness due to the large sample sizes likely needed to demonstrate a significant effect. Further efforts are needed to plan for alternative study designs to estimate the impact of maternal RSV vaccine programs on recurrent childhood wheezing in general populations.

AB Background: Patient reminders are recommended to increase vaccination rates. The objectives of this study were to estimate the percentage of children 6 months-17 years for whom a patient reminder for influenza vaccination was received by a child's parent or guardian, estimate influenza vaccination coverage by receipt of a patient reminder, and identify factors associated with receipt of a patient reminder.
   Methods: National Immunization Survey-Flu (NIS-Flu) data for the 2013-14 influenza season were analyzed. Tests of association between patient reminders and demographic characteristics were conducted using Wald chi-square tests and pairwise comparison t-tests. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine variables independently associated with receiving a patient reminder.
   Results: Approximately 22% of children had a parent or guardian report receiving a patient reminder for influenza vaccination for their child, ranging from 12.9% in Idaho to 41.2% in Mississippi. Children with a patient reminder were more likely to be vaccinated compared with children without a patient reminder (73.7% versus 55.5%). In the multivariable model, reminder receipt was higher for children 6-23 months compared with children 13-17 years, black children compared with white children, and children whose parent completed the survey in English compared with children whose parent completed the survey in a language other than English or Spanish.
   Conclusions: Although patient reminders are associated with a higher likelihood of influenza vaccination, nationally, less than one-fourth of children had a parent report receiving one. Despite being based on parental report, with its limitations, this study suggests that increasing the number of parents who receive patient reminders for their children may improve vaccination coverage among children.

AB Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) infection is the leading cause of lower respiratory tract infection in both young children and older adults. Currently, there is no licensed vaccine available, and therapeutic options are limited. The infectious RSV particle is decorated with a type I viral fusion (F) glycoprotein that structurally rearranges from a metastable prefusion form to a highly stable postfusion form. In people naturally infected with RSV, the neutralizing antibodies primarily recognize the prefusion conformation. Therefore, engineered RSV F protein stabilized in its prefusion conformation has been an attractive strategy for developing RSV F vaccine antigens. Long-term stability at 4 degrees C or higher is a desirable attribute for a RSV F subunit vaccine antigen. We have previously shown that a prefusion stabilized RSV F construct, DS-Cavl, undergoes conformational changes and forms intermediate structures upon long-term storage at 4 degrees C. Structure-based design was performed to improve the stability of the RSV F subunit vaccine. We identified additional mutations that further stabilize RSV F protein in its prefusion conformation by using binding to a previously described antigenic site I antibody 4D7 as the screening tool. In addition, we designed and identified variants with increased expression levels, which is another desirable attribute for a subunit vaccine. Our data suggested that an RSV F variant F111 is properly folded, and has improved heat stability as well as stability upon long-term storage at 4 degrees C. A mouse immunogenicity study demonstrated that no compromise in immunogenicity (both binding and neutralizing antibody levels) was observed with the introduction of these additional mutations.

AB Background: China's immunization program is one of the oldest and largest in the world. Rates of vaccine-preventable diseases (VPD) are comparable to those in high-income countries. The program's evolution has been characterized by ambitious target setting and innovative strategies that have not been widely described.
   Methods: We reviewed national and provincial health department archives; analyzed disease surveillance, vaccination coverage, and serosurvey data from 1950 through 2016; and, conducted in-depth interviews with senior Chinese experts involved early VPD control efforts.
   Results: Widespread immunization began in the 1950s with smallpox, diphtheria, and Bacillus-Calmette Guerin vaccines, and in the 1960s with pertussis, tetanus, polio, measles, and Japanese encephalitis (jE) vaccines. The largest drops in absolute VPD burden occurred in the 1970s with establishment of the Rural Cooperative Medical System and a cadre of trained peasant health workers whose responsibilities included vaccinations. From 1970 to 1979, incidence per 100,000 population dropped 48% from 3.3 to 1.75 for diphtheria, 50% from 152.2 to 49.4 for pertussis, 77% from 2.5 to 0.6 for polio, 60% from 450.5 to 178.3 for measles, and 72% from 18.0 to 5.1 for JE, averting an average of 4 million VPD cases each year. Until the early 1980s, vaccines were delivered through annual winter campaigns using a coordinated 'rush-relay' system to expedite transport while leveraging vaccine thermostability. Establishment of the cold chain system during in the 1980s allowed bi-monthly vaccination rounds and more timely vaccination resulting in rates of diphtheria, pertussis, measles and meningitis falling over 90% from 1980 to 1989, while polio and JE rates fell 40-50%. In the 1990s, progress stalled as financing for public health was weakened by broad market reforms. Large investments in public health and immunizations by the central government since 2004 has led to further declines in VPD burden and increased equity. During 20112016, the incidence per 100,000 population was <2.0 for measles and <0.2 for pertussis, JE, meningococcal meningitis, and hepatitis A. From 1992 to 2014, the prevalence of chronic hepatitis B infection in children <5 years fell from 9.7% to 0.3%, a 97% decline. China was certified polio-free in 2000 and diphtheria was last reported in 2006.
   Conclusions: Long-term political commitment to immunizations as a basic right, ambitious targets, use of disease incidence as the primary metric to assess program performance, and nationwide scale-up of successful locally developed strategies that optimized use of available limited resources have been critical to China's success in controlling vaccine-preventable diseases.

AB Objective: To determine uptake of influenza vaccination in children with special risk medical conditions (SRMC) and to explore associations with vaccination.
   Design: Cross-sectional study.
   Setting/participants: Parents of children with a SRMC attending either outpatient department clinics or being an inpatient at the Women's and Children's Hospital (WCH), Adelaide, Australia from September 2015 to February 2016 were recruited using convenience sampling.
   Methods: Data were collected using a face-to-face survey. Influenza vaccination was verified with providers. Characteristics associated with uptake were explored using univariable and multivariable analyses.
   Results: There were 410 participants with complete data. Confirmed influenza vaccination at least once in the last two years was 50%, annual uptake was 32.8%. 63.9% of parents were aware of the vaccination recommendation and 57.9% had been recommended by a specialist or general practitioner (GP). Characteristics strongly associated with uptake included: receiving a recommendation from a specialist or GP and having a parent receive the influenza vaccine annually.
   Conclusions: Despite a long standing funded program, influenza vaccination uptake in children with SRMC is suboptimal. Parental vaccination behaviour, along with medical practitioner recommendation, particularly specialist recommendation, appear to be key influences in facilitating vaccination. Potential interventions could target the family rather than just the individual child. Understanding the barriers to recommendation from the perspective of general medical practitioners and specialists who treat these children is needed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The adjuvant effects of flagellin on regulation of immune response have been proved; whether flagellin could assist tumor cell lysate (TCL) to enhance anti-glioma immunity remains to be investigated. This study tests a hypothesis that therapeuticly intracranial administration with flagellin plus TCL enhances the effects of specific immunotherapy on glioma in mice. In this study, GL261 cells were transferred into C57BL/6 mice and the GL261-bearing mice were subcutaneously or intracranially inoculated with flagellin plus TCL, flagellin, TCL or saline. Our results showed that prophylacticly subcutaneous administration with TCL and flagellin could induce potent cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and prolong the survival of GL261-bearing mice significantly, but therapeuticly subcutaneous administration failed to. However, therapeuticly intracranial administration of TCL plus flagellin could prolong the survival. Moreover, intracranial administration of flagellin could recruit CD4(+) T cells and CD8(+) T cells to brain tissues, induce proliferation of natural killer (NK) cells, CD4(+) T cells and CD8(+) T cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and induce to splenomegaly. The results suggested that flagellin could be acted as an efficient adjuvant for TCL based vaccine. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Effective interventions to promote human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination are needed, particularly among populations at increased risk of HPV-related disease. We developed and pilot tested a web-based intervention, Outsmart HPV, to promote HPV vaccination among young gay and bisexual men (YGBM).
   Methods: In 2016, we recruited a national sample (n = 150) of YGBM ages 18-25 in the United States who had not received any doses of HPV vaccine. Participants were randomized to receive either standard HPV vaccination information (control) or population-targeted, individually-tailored content (Outsmart HPV intervention). We assessed between group differences in HPV vaccination attitudes and beliefs immediately following the intervention using multiple linear regression.
   Results: There were no differences in HPV vaccination attitudes, beliefs and intentions between groups at baseline. Compared to participants in the control group, intervention participants reported: greater perception that men who have sex with men are at higher risk for anal cancer relative to other men (b = 0.34); greater HPV vaccination self-efficacy (b = 0.15); and fewer perceived harms of HPV vaccine (b = -0.34) on posttest surveys (all p < .05). Overall, intervention participants reported high levels of acceptability and satisfaction with the Outsmart HPV intervention (all > 4.4 on a 5-point scale).
   Conclusions: Findings from this study provide preliminary support for a brief, tailored web-based intervention in improving HPV vaccination attitudes and beliefs among YGBM. An important next step is to determine the effects of Outsmart HPV on HPV vaccine uptake. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To monitor T-2 toxin rapidly in milk, a highly specific against T-2 toxin monoclonal antibody (mAb) was produced and a sensitive indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ic-ELISA) was developed. T-2 toxin was first converted to T-2-adipic anhydride (T-2HA), and then Keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) and virus-like particles (VLP) were synthesized and conjugated to T-2HA as coating and immunogen antigen, respectively. After the inoculation of female Balb/c mice and cell fusions, a high affinity mAb was produced. After optimization, the 50% inhibition concentration (IC50) for the developed ic-ELISA was estimated as 0.137 ng mL(-1). Based on this mAb, an optimized ic-ELISA protocol was developed using the dilution method to prepare milk samples. The limits of detection of T-2 toxin in milk was 0.827 ng mL(-1), the mean recovery of T-2 toxin in spiked samples (2.5, 5 and 10 ng mL(-1)) ranged from 85.0% to 98.9%, and the CVs ranged from 6.1% to 8.6%. The ic-ELISA was validated by HPLC-MS/MS method, and all results demonstrated that it was a suitable screening method for detecting T-2 toxin in milk.

AB We present a case from Valencia, Spain, of a 25-year-old woman who presented with a painful erythematous skin lesion, initially diagnosed as cellulitis. The lesion was unresponsive to antibiotic treatments and progressed into a hemorrhagic blister with necrotic ulcer formation. Posterior collection of a spider from the patient's home and expert identification of the spider as Loxosceles rufescens was achieved, establishing the diagnosis of probable cutaneous loxoscelism. Symptomatic treatment, general wound care and ultimately surgery, resulted in complete recovery with minor residual scarring. This case illustrates some of the difficulties encountered in the diagnosis and treatment of loxoscelism and adds to the increasing reports of loxoscelism in the Mediterranean Basin.

AB Crotoxin (CTX), a heterodimeric phospholipase present in venom of snakes of the genus Crotalus, has demonstrated a broad spectrum of pharmacological properties, such as antimicrobial, hemostatic, and antitumoral. However, the precise mechanism of its cytotoxicity and antitumoral properties remains to be determined. Therefore, in the present study, we isolated crotoxin CTX) through two steps DEAE-Sepharose and Heparin-Sepharose FF chromatography. The C-terminal sequence of the A- and B-chain protein fragment was determined by LC-MS/MS mass spectrometry, which showed 100% identity to crotoxin structure. In order to investigate its cytotoxic effects, we demonstrated that the F1 CTX fraction at 0-30 mu g/mL concentrations for 72 h presented a heterogeneous response profile on nine human cancer-derived cell lines from four tumor types (pancreatic, esophagus, cervical cancer, and glioma). The glioma (GAMG and HCB151) and pancreatic (PSN-1 and PANC-1) cancer cells showed a higher sensitivity with IC50 of < 0.5, 4.1, 0.7 and < 0.5 mu g/mL, respectively. Conversely, F1 CTX does not reduce the viability of normal cells. On the other hand, cervical (SiHa) and esophagus (KYSE270) cancer cell lines presented higher resistance, with IC50 higher than 30.2 and 8.7 mu g/mL, respectively. Moreover, F1 CTX did not affect cell cycle distribution under the conditions evaluated and seems to be more cytotoxic than cytostatic. The pro-apoptotic effect of F1 CTX treatment was demonstrated in glioma (HCB151) cell line. In addition, crotoxin revealed a potential to initiate cell responses such as DNA damage in glioma (HCB151) and pancreatic cancer by H2AX activity induction. Conversely, F1 CTX does not reduce the viability of normal cells. Importantly, the comparison of F1 CTX effect with standard chemotherapeutic agents demonstrated a greater cytotoxic potential in the majority of tumor types (glioma, pancreatic, and cervical cancer). On the other hand, F1 CTX was less cytotoxic in esophageal cell lines compared to the gemcitabine agent used in clinical practice. Therefore, this work showed that F1 CTX has a cytotoxic activity and pro-apoptotic potential, contributing to the knowledge about the F1 crotoxin properties as well as its possible use in cancer research, particularly in glioma and pancreatic cancer cell lines.

AB Deoxynivalenol (DON), Fumonisin B-1 (FB1) and Aflatoxin B1 (AFB(1)) have strong toxicity to humans and exist widely in grain and food. It is necessary to screen these mycotoxins to guarantee food safety. In order to develop a rapid, simple, low-cost and simultaneous-detection method, composites of antibody-nano-Au-particles, DON-BSA, FB1-BSA, and AFB(1)-BSA were prepared to establish a lateral flow assay based on competitive inhibition. The results suggested that the visual detection limits for DON, FB1 and AFB(1) were 10, 30, and 10 ng mL(-1), respectively. On the other hand, it had no reactivity to T-2 toxin, zearalenone, ochratoxin A and nivalenol, which demonstrates good specificity. Besides, the strip had good repeatability and stability. Therefore, DON, FB1 and AFB(1) would be screened simultaneously by lateral flow assay for food safety.

AB Aflatoxin B-1 (AFB(1)), is one of the most toxic mycotoxins found to contaminate various food commodities like cereals, dried fruits, tree nuts, spices and crude vegetable oils. In spite of considerable progress in analytical techniques, there is still a need to develop rapid and highly sensitive detection platforms for AFB(1). In this study, AFB(1) specific aptamer was used as a capture molecule to develop an enzyme-linked apta-sorbent assay (ELASA) for ultrasensitive detection of AFB(1). Under optimized conditions, the assay had a linear detection range from 1 mu g to 1 g with a limit of detection (LOD) of 1 pg/ml in buffer. Conventional ELISA with AFB(1) hapten as the capture agent (LOD = 10 pg/mL) was also carried out to compare the results with the present method. Recovery studies in food samples like dried red chillies, groundnut and pepper using both the methods was found to be in the range of 88.49-106.4% at 10 ng/mL and 87.4% to 95.8% at 5 ng/mL for ELASA and 76.56-127.68% at 10 ng/mL and 82-101.2% at 5 ng/mL for ELISA. Higher detection (10 fold) and better recovery using ELASA suggest that the method could offer an early, ultrasensitive, high-throughput, qualitative and semi-quantitative detection of AFB(1) in contaminated food samples.

AB Amanitin-induced apoptosis is proposed to have a significant effect on the pathogenesis of liver damage. However, few reports have focused on proteome changes induced by alpha-amanitin (alpha-AMA). Here, we evaluated changes in mitochondrial proteins of hepatocytes in response to 2 mu M alpha-AMA, a concentration at which alpha-AMA-induced cell damage could be rescued at cellular level by common clinical drugs. We found 56 proteins were differentially expressed in an alpha-AMA-treated group. Among them, 38 proteins were downregulated and 18 were upregulated. Downregulated functional proteins included importer TOMM40, respiratory chain component cytochrome C, and metabolic enzymes of citrate acid cycle such as malate dehydrogenase, which localize on the mitochondrial outer membrane, inner membrane and matrix respectively. Immunoblot analysis showed that alpha-AMA decreased mitochondrial import receptor subunit TOMM40 and cytochrome c accompanied by an increase in the cytosol although their total protein levels were not affected significantly. The mitochondrial membrane potential was also destroyed by alpha-AMA and was restored by the clinical drug silibinin. Immunofluorescence suggested that mitochondrial morphology did not change. Taken together, our results provide further insights into the toxic mechanism of alpha-AMA on hepatocytes.

AB Studies of scorpion venoms have used different venom drying methods: lyophilization, desiccation, lyophilization after mixing with 0.9% saline or purified water and centrifugation. The aim of this study was to see if these different approaches cause some alteration in the composition of the venom or interfere with its biological effects. Mice were injected (i.p.) with T. serrulatus scorpion venom in the liquid form (G-liq) or dried by different methods (lyophilized - G-lyo; centrifuged and the supernatant lyophilized G-cen; desiccated G-des), and observed regarding the occurrence of the symptoms respiratory difficulty, convulsion and death. The occurrence of seizures, although occurring in all groups and with the various doses used, did not prove to be effective to determine differences between the different handling techniques. Respiratory distress appeared to be useful in analyzing differences between groups, where this effect was less pronounced in the G-liq and G-des groups. In general, death occurred in a certain proportion with increasing dose for all groups. G-liq and G-des seemed to be more "active" at lower doses and G-cen and G-lyo at higher doses. The electrophoretic and chromatographic profile demonstrated main differences between G-liq and the dried groups. In the electrophoretic profile, the liquid venom showed bands of proteins of higher concentration and greater number of major bands and the three dried venom had the lowest number of protein bands. The HPLC profile and densitometry of the electrophoretic profiles showed some differences that may be associated with different protein conformation/aggregation. Our data indicated that lyophilization is the most suitable method for processing T. serrulatus scorpion venom after extraction.

AB Ipomoea asanfolia has been associated with a tremorgenic syndrome in livestock. Recently indole diterpene compounds were identified in I. asarifolia, some of which have been shown to cause a tremorgenic syndrome. In this study, the tremorgenic nature of I. asarifolia was assessed using a mouse model. Adult mice were fed rodent chow containing 10, 15, 20 and 25% endophyte infected (E+), or 25% endophyte free (E-), I. asanfolia for 14 days. The mice fed E+ chow developed a tremorgenic syndrome as characterized by visually observed muscle tremors and an inability to traverse a balance beam, whereas the mice fed E- chow did not develop tremors and had similar muscle coordination to control mice. A lactating mouse model was also used to determine if the compounds can be transferred to nursing pups via the milk. Nursing pups were exposed via their mother's milk for 21 days, from post-natal day 0-21. The pups from dams exposed to E+ chow developed a similar tremor genic syndrome. Data presented in this study demonstrate that the tremorgenic compounds in I. asarifolia are endophyte derived. Additionally, both adult mice and nursing pups are good models for studying the tremor genic nature of I. asarifolia and related plants.

TI Incidence of snakebites in 3 different geographic regions in Thua Thien
   Hue province, central Vietnam: Green pit vipers and cobras cause the
   majority of bites
SO TOXICON
LA English
DT Article
DE Incidence; Snakebite; Vietnam; Green pit viper; Cobra
AB Background: The annual incidence of snakebites in Vietnam is not known and only few publications about snakebite envenoming and medically relevant snakes can be found in English language literature. The present community-based surveys provide data on incidence of snakebites in three different geographic regions of Thua Thien Hue (TT Hue) province, central Vietnam and snake species responsible for bites in this region,
   Methodology/results: The cross-sectional community based surveys were conducted from March to July 2017. Multistage cluster sampling was applied and snakebite incidence was calculated at 58 snakebites per 100,000 person-years for the entire province, and 172, 69 and 10 snakebites per 100,000 person-years in the mountainous, coastal and urban region of TT Hue province, respectively. Thirty-one snakebite victims interviewed during the surveys reported 18 (58%) green pit viper bites (Trimeresurus species), 5 (16%) cobra bites (Naja kaouthia, Naja siamensis), 2 (7%) krait bites (Bungarus candidus, Bungarus fasciatus), 2 (7%) red-necked keelback bites (Rhabdophis subminiatus) and 4 bites from unidentified snakes (13%). The outcome was favourable for 28 snakebite victims (90%), two (6%) had minor sequelae and one (3%) victim died after a Malayan krait bite. Two hundred and twenty-one snakebite patients were treated in 9 district hospitals and one central hospital in TT Hue between 2014 and 2016. Eighty green pit vipers (84%), 12 cobras (13%) and 3 kraits (3%) were responsible for bites in 95 patients where snake identification was documented.
   Conclusions: Incidence of snakebites is surprisingly low in TT Hue province in central Vietnam in comparison to other regions in Asia, particularly to neighbouring Lao PDR. However, snakebites are still a significant health problem in the mountainous region and green pit vipers and cobras cause the vast majority of bites.

AB Domoic acid (DA) is a neurotoxin naturally produced by Pseudo-nitzschia diatoms that may be transferred through the marine food web and cause mass mortality events at higher trophic levels. Yet, the effects of the dissolved marine toxin on foraging responses and swimming performances of fish early stages are poorly known. Here we evaluated the effects of short-term exposure (24 h) to a single dose of domoic acid (136 mu g DA L-1) on larvae (15-20 days post-hatch) of three commercially important fish species (the sea breams Diplodus sargus and Sparus aurata and the meagre Argyrosomus regius). Although DA exposure did not elicit significant effects on larval survival (p > 0.05) and swimming performance (p > 0.05), the toxin significantly affected the fish capture success (p < 0.001). Our findings suggest that toxigenic Pseudo-nitzschia blooms may compromise fish early stages, in particular larvae feeding behaviours, leading to complications in the development and increasing fish vulnerability and mortality.

AB The efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp) has been implicated in multidrug resistance of different nematode parasites affecting livestock species. Increased expression of P-gp in nematodes after their in vitro as well as in vivo exposure to anthelmintics suggests a role of P-gp in drug resistance. The current study evaluated the P-gp gene expression in a highly-resistant isolate of the sheep nematode Haemonchus contortus, selected after exposure to ivermectin (IVM) treatments at 10-fold the therapeutic dose. Four lambs were artificially infected with L-3 (7000 L-3/animal) of a previously selected IVM highly resistant H. contortus isolate. Forty five (45) days after infection, adult worms were collected at 0 (untreated), 6, 12 and 24 h post-oral IVM (2 mg/kg) administration. The relative transcription levels of different H. contortus P-gp genes were studied by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and confirmed by RNA-seq. P-gpl and P-gpl 1 gene expressions did not change throughout the experimental sampling period. P-gp3 and P-gp9.1 transcripts decreased significantly at both 12 and 24h post IVM exposure. P-gp2 expression was progressively increased in a time-dependent manner at 1.81 (6 h), 2.08 (12 h) and 2.49 (24 h)-fold compared to adult worms not exposed (control 0 h) to IVM, although without reaching statistically significant differences (P > 0.05). P-gp12 was neither detected by qPCR nor by RNA-seq analysis. These relatively modest changes in the P-gp gene expression could not be enough to explain the high level of IVM resistance displayed by the H. contortus isolate under assessment. Overexpression of membrane drug transporters including P-gp has been associated with IVM resistance in different nematode parasites. However, some evidences suggest that resistance to IVM and other macrocyclic lactones may develop by multiple mechanisms. Further studies are needed to improve the understanding of resistance mechanisms in adult stages of H. contortus.

AB The genus Chilodonella includes free-living ciliated protozoa as well as pathogenic species for freshwater fish, with Chilodonella hexasticha and Chilodonella piscicola being the most important ones. These parasites cause outbreaks with high mortalities among farmed freshwater fishes with great economic losses. There are few reports of these species in China, and their identification has been based mostly on their morphological char- acteristics. In the present work, the parasites causing five outbreaks occurring in China between 2014 and 2017 have been identified by morphological and genetic analysis. We provide the first records of Ctenopharingodon idella and Siniperca chuatsi as hosts of C. hexasticha, and of Procypris rabaudi and Schizothorax wangchiachii as hosts of C. piscicola. There are no differences in the gross pathological findings produced by C. hexasticha and C. piscicola, consisting in desquamation and necrosis of epithelial cells in the skin and gills and in severe fusion of gill lamellae. However, both species differ in their geographic distribution: C. piscicola was found in farms located at altitudes over 1500 m above sea level and with a water temperature <= 18 degrees C, while C. hexasticha was found in farms located at altitudes under 50 m above sea level and with a water temperature >= 21 degrees C. Present results confirm that C. hexasticha and C. piscicola are two different species that can be differenced by their morphology; however, their biological variability may lead to erroneous identifications and the diagnosis should be preferably based in genetic analysis including nuclear LSU rDNA and mitochondrial SSU rDNA sequences.

AB Gastrointestinal nematode infection is one of the major diseases affecting small ruminants. Although some breeds of goats are quite resistant, many breeds of goats are relatively susceptible. This study used a combined parasitological, immunological, bioinformatic and statistical approach to examine the role of goat IgA and eosinophils in protection against Teladorsagia circumcincta. Molecular modelling suggested that the transmembrane domain of the high affinity IgA receptor was dysfunctional in goats. Statistical analyses failed to find any association in naturally infected goats between high IgA or eosinophil responses and low faecal egg counts. Together these results indicate that IgA and eosinophil responses against T. circumcincta are less effective in goats than sheep.

AB Neospora caninum is an obligate intracellular protozoan parasite that infects a wide range of mammalian species, and particularly causes the reproductive loss in cattle. We identified a novel dense granule protein, N. caninum granule protein 17 (NcGRA17) using the CRISPR/cas9 genome editing system and studied its function. We generated the NcGRA17 knockout strain (Delta NcGRA17) and NcGRA17 complementary strain (i Delta NcGRA17). Plaque assays and intracellular proliferation tests showed that the Delta NcGRA17 strain formed smaller plaques and had slower intracellular growth. Mouse virulence assay showed loss of virulence for the Delta NcGRA17 strain. We observed that the parasitophorous vacuoles (PVs) of NcGRA17-deficient parasites have aberrant morphology. To investigate the contribution of NcGRA17 alpha-helices to aberrant morphology of PVs, we transfected four truncated forms of NcGRA17 into NcGRA17 knockout strain and the phenotypes of these mutants were analysed. Lack of the N-terminal region (NT) failed to target the protein to dense granules, while NcGRA17 (Delta alpha 1)-HA, NcGRA17 (Delta alpha 2-4)-HA and NcGRA17 (Delta alpha 5-8)-HA were targeted to dense granules, but failed to rescue the aberrant PV morphology. Our results indicate that NcGRA17 as a dense granule protein determines PV morphology and pathogenicity, and alpha-helices of NcGRA17 may be responsible for the aberrant morphology of N. caninum PVs.

ID RESISTANCE; ACARICIDES; EFFICACY; EXTRACTS
AB Reproductive parameters of Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus are often evaluated. They are good indicators of resistance to commercial acaricides and of plant extracts' efficacy. The objective of this study was to compare the techniques: visual estimation and quantification by sampling used in the Adult Immersion Test (AIT) to calculate the hatching rate of eggs. Engorged females collected from cattle were subjected to the AIT with plant extracts and kept in an incubator for oviposition. The egg hatching was evaluated in 210 syringes by visual estimation (%). Then, eggs and larvae were counted into samples of 100 individuals, in three repetitions by stereo microscope. Significant differences were found between the two tests (p <= 0.05). The egg hatching average of visual estimation was higher than the quantification by sampling, 56.8-48.0, respectively (correlation = 0.85). We found that the visual assessment leads to a higher estimate of larvae in relation to eggs, because the infertile eggs can be concealed in the center of the syringe. In quantification by sampling, no statistical differences (p = 0.99) were observed in the pairwise counts between the three samples (48.1 +/- 26.6%, 47.8 +/- 26.9%, 48.1 +/- 26.5%) (correlation of repetitions = 0.96). This suggests that counting one sample is sufficient and the result should not differ much, regardless of the evaluator. Regarding the cutoff point of tick resistance status (95%), both methods are reliable. This study contributes to improvement of the AIT and can stimulate researchers to choose more accurate techniques for the assessment of egg hatching.

AB Equine piroplasmosis, disease globally responsible for significant economic losses, is caused by the transmission of the hemoprotozoa Theileria equi and Babesia caballi by ticks. Transplacental transmission has been reported previously in horses, which is not the case for mules' foals. The present study investigated, by Real Time-PCR (RT-PCR), the presence of both Theileria equi and Babesia caballi in newborn mules before the ingestion of colostrum. Blood samples of 18 mares and their respective mules' foals were collected and analyzed by RT-PCR. Only one mare was positive for B. caballi. In contrast, 13 mares were positive for T. equi, with two foals (11.1%) positive for the same protozoon, both of affected mares. We may conclude that transplacental transmission of Theileria equi also occurs in mules which may be an important concern while breeding such animals.

AB The present study was conducted to further characterize the anthelmintic activity of the 0.5% w/v topical formulation of eprinomectin (EPRINEX (R) Pour-on, Merial) when administered at 1 mg/kg body weight to sheep in preventing the establishment of induced gastrointestinal and pulmonary nematode infections.
   Thirty-six female Merino sheep (similar to 4 months of age, weighing 27.0-36.0 kg) were blocked by pre-treatment body weight to form blocks of four animals. Within blocks, the animals were randomly allocated to either remain untreated (control) or be treated once with EPRINEX (R) . either on Day 0, Day 7 or Day 14. Starting on Day 15, the sheep were given trickle infections with infective larvae of seven species of gastrointestinal nematodes and Dictyocaulus filaria lungworms daily for seven consecutive days. Five weeks after completion of the daily challenge (Day 56), the animals were necropsied for parasite recovery and count.
   Treatment with EPRINEX (R) prevented the establishment ( > 90%, p <= 0.027) of D. filaria, Teladorsagia circumcincta (pinnata/trifurcata), Cooperia curticei, Nematodirus battus, Trichostrongylus colubriformis and Oesophagostomum venulosum for at least 21 days, and of Haemonchus contortus and Trichostrongylus axei for at least 14 days. Sheep in the groups treated with EPRINEX (R) at Days 7 and 14 had significantly (p <= 0.018) higher Day -1 to Day 56 wt gains than the untreated controls.
   No treatment-related health problems or any other health problems were observed throughout the study.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of melarsomine hydrochloride (Cymelarsan (R)) to cure horses suffering from a nervous form of dourine, a sexually-transmitted disease caused by Trypanosome equiperdum. The recently described experimental model for assessing drug efficacy against horse trypanosomosis allowed us to obtain eight horses (Welsh pony mares) infected by T. equiperdum with parasites in their cerebrospinal fluid. The Cymelarsan (R) treatment evaluated consisted of the daily administration of 0.5 mg/kg of Cymelarsan (R) over 7 days. Two control horses remained untreated, three horses received the treatment 36 days p.i. and three horses received the treatment 16 days p.i. Following treatment, we observed parasite clearance in blood, stabilization of rectal temperature and a relative improvement in the mean packed cell volume levels for all treated horses. However, live parasites were later observed again in the CSF of all treated horses. Our results indicate the inability of Cymelarsan (R) to reach Trypanozoon located in the central nervous system of infected horses and thus discourage the use of Cymelarsan (R) to treat animals suffering from a nervous form of dourine.

AB Haemonchus contortus is an economic problem in sheep farms worldwide, mainly in the tropics and subtropics. A vaccine against haemonchosis, called Barbervax (R), was evaluated in ewes under two nutritional status, naturally infected with gastrointestinal nematodes. Ewes were divided into four groups: Supplemented Diet - Vaccine; Supplemented Diet - No vaccine; Basal Diet - Vaccine and Basal Diet - No vaccine. Their lambs were divided in Vaccinated and No vaccine. Ewes were immunised six times starting about 1 month of pregnancy with the first three doses at 3 week intervals and the last three shots at 4 week intervals. Supplemented ewes had higher body weight, body score and packed cell volume compared with those fed a basal diet. Both groups of vaccinated ewes showed a similar response in circulating anti-vaccine antibodies but the vaccine had no discernible effect on either body weight, body score and packed cell volume. There was a marked group difference in the number of ewes that received precautionary treatments with anthelmintic. All 14 Basal Diet - No vaccine ewes required treatment. In contrast only 7 ewes, in the Supplemented Diet - Vaccine group required anthelmintic treatment. In the Basal Diet - Vaccine and in the Supplemented Diet - No Vaccine groups, 12 and 13 ewes needed anthelmintic treatment, respectively. Vaccinated lambs showed much higher antibody titres resulting in 80% less Haemonchus spp. egg counts comparing with no vaccine lambs. Taken together these results clearly suggest that in pregnant and lactating ewes a combined protective effect between vaccination and improved nutrition resulted in fewer precautionary anthelmintic treatments. Thus, it was possible to achieve a more sustainable level of control of the haemonchosis, less dependent on anthelmintic drugs.

AB Diarrhea is common in young calves and is often caused by Cryptosporidium parvum infection. The aim of this study was to investigate if disinfection of calf pens with hydrated lime would reduce contamination of C. parvum oocysts and improve calf health in herds with C. parvum associated diarrhea problems. Four dairy herds with ongoing C. parvum associated calf diarrhea problems each participated in the study over six to seven months. During the study period, all pens/huts for young calves were cleaned according to the usual farm routine before a new calf entered. Hydrated lime was then used to disinfect half of the pens/huts. Diarrhea incidence was recorded by the farmers and by veterinarians, who clinically examined the calves every second month. In total, 402 calves participated in the study. The farmers detected diarrhea in 214 (53%) calves, with similar proportions in calves kept in lime disinfected and control pens. Age at diarrhea onset was significantly higher in lime disinfected pens than in control pens, 9.0 days and 7.6 days, respectively. There was no difference between the groups regarding duration or severity index recorded by the farmers. The body condition score in 6-8 week old calves was significantly higher in calves that had been kept in lime disinfected pens during their first weeks of life, indicating that calves in disinfected pens/huts were less affected by their infections.
   Faecal samples from 5 to 21 day old calves, were collected on four occasions at each farm (n = 95). Cryptosporidium positive samples were found at all samplings in all four herds. Cryptosporidium spp. was detected in 79 (83%) samples with no difference between lime disinfected and control pens. C. parvum was the dominant species. Two different C. parvum subtypes were found; IIaA16G1R1b in three herds and IIaA16G1R1b_variant in one herd. Only one subtype was found in each herd.
   Disinfection of calf pens with slaked lime delayed onset of diarrhea and improved the body condition in the calves, but did not affect diarrhea incidence or duration. Although lime disinfection alone will not be sufficient to control Cryptosporidium associated diarrhea in herds with extensive calf diarrhea problems, these results suggest that it can be a valuable complement to other measures.

AB The establishment rate of Cooperia oncophora related to host age and previous infection was investigated in young calves. Calves of similar age were kept on a feed pad and allocated into multiple groups, based on their age and weight. Two groups (each n = 16) received trickle infections with an ivermectin-susceptible C. oncophora isolate of 2000 or 10,000 infective stage larvae per week while another group (n = 16) was kept as an uninfected control. At intervals over a period of 11 months, two animals from each group were challenged with 15,000 infective stage larvae of an ivermectin-resistant isolate, 25 days later orally treated with ivermectin and 5 days after that slaughtered for worm counts. On three occasions additional calves (n = 2), subjected to the high trickle infection rate, received an ivermectin treatment to remove the existing worm burden, prior to challenge as above. Further calves (n = 4) of similar age were introduced at the beginning and the end of the experiment to determine the effect of larval age on establishment rate. The establishment in the two trickle infection groups declined to < 10% within the first three months, which was significantly different from the control group. In the animals receiving the high trickle infection, but an anthelmintic treatment before challenge the establishment rate was not significantly different from the controls. Over the duration of the experiment establishment in the control group declined from 53% to < 20%, which was similar to the decrease recorded at the beginning and the end of the experiment in the animals to determine the effect of larval age. The findings indicate that an existing C. oncophora burden had a strong effect on the establishment of incoming larvae in the trickle infected groups, but this was not observed if the existing burden was removed before the final challenge. The decline in establishment rate in the control group was attributed to the age of the larvae and not the age of the calves per se.

AB The aims of this study were to determine the species of Parascaris present in foals in Sweden and to establish whether anthelmintic resistance to pyrantel and fenbendazole is present on Swedish stud farms. Ascarid eggs collected from different regions in Sweden were karyotyped and were all identified as Parascaris univalens, characterized by one chromosomal pair. Faecal egg count reduction tests were performed on a total of 142 foals on 9 farms between September 2016 and May 2017. Healthy foals with at least 150 eggs per gram faeces (EPG) were included in the study and treated with oral pastes of pyrantel embonate or fenbendazole according to manufacturer instructions. The efficacy of the drugs was calculated by a Bayesian model using the R package "eggCounts". In accordance with the American Association of Equine Practitioners, parasites were classified as resistant to pyrantel if the reduction in EPG was <= 85% and to fenbendazole if the observed efficacy was <= 90%. Four of eleven groups treated with pyrantel had an observed efficacy of <= 85%, and as many as 43% of the foals treated with pyrantel excreted eggs 10-16 days after treatment. In contrast, one of the six groups treated with fenbendazole had an observed efficacy of s <= 90%, and only 6% of all foals were excreting eggs 10-16 days after treatment. Since resistance to ivermectin has earlier been shown to be widespread in Parascaris spp. in Sweden it is likely that multiresistant populations are present on Swedish stud farms. This is the first study showing the existence of pyrantel-resistant Parascaris spp. in Europe, and the first ever study where anthelmintic resistance has been shown in P. univalens.

AB The apicomplexan protozoan Cryptosporidium parvum is an important causative agent of diarrhea of neonatal bovines. Vaccination has been proposed as an advantageous strategy against cryptosporidiosis of calves since besides protection against disease it has also the potential to prevent dissemination of infective oocysts into the environment. Antigens anchored to the parasite surface via glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) are implicated in host cell attachment and invasion and represent promising vaccine candidates. A reverse vaccinology approach was employed to (i) identify the GPI-anchored proteome of C. parvum using available web-based bioinformatic tools and (ii) characterize previously unrecognized novel vaccine antigens. Altogether, 14 putative GPI-anchored proteins could be determined of which CpH1 and CpSUB2 as well as GP60 were further characterized. Sequencing and comparison of GP60, CpH1, and CpSUB1 alleles amplified from different geographic isolates showed a high degree of conservation. All three antigens were recombinant expressed and immunoblotted using sera of 12 Cryptosporidium-infected calves sampled at age periods 1-11 and 12-28 days after birth. Specific antibody reactions against the studied antigens were detected in all analyzed calves, demonstrating their im-munreactivity and expression, and recognition in vivo at an early stage of host infection. Besides the acknowledged GP60 vaccinogen, the presented reverse vaccinology approach reveals the additional vaccine candidates CpH1 and CpSUB1 for inclusion into a subunit vaccine formulation.

AB This paper proposed a real-time simulation model of a diesel engine based on the fuel transfer in the combustion zone and an array calculation method. The proposed model conducts real-time optimized modelling of the diesel engine multi-zone model from two aspects: a modelling method and a model algorithm. From the modelling method perspective, the model proposed a combustion process model that transfers fuel mass and momentum between the combustion zones. Based on the diesel combustion characteristics, this modelling method divides the cylinder into three thermodynamic zones: an unburned area, a premixed combustion zone, and a diffusion combustion zone. This division addresses the assumption that fuel mass and momentum transfer are not performed between Combustion zones in the traditional multi-zone model. While reducing the computation regions and improving the simulation calculation speed, the combustion process of the premixed combustion zone and the diffusion combustion zone were described using the method of Stefan flow and entrainment combustion. The physical depth and the predictivity of the model was enhanced, which rendered the description of the combustion process more consistent with the diesel combustion characteristics. The thermodynamic calculation process of the three regions was maintained throughout the entire cyclic operation in the entire diesel engine operating cycle. From the model calculation perspective, the model proposed a direct single-step calculation method for temperature and pressure to satisfy the demand of real-time model calculation. To optimize the multi-cylinder multi-zone plan in a real-time environment, the model utilizes an array method for calculation. The results of the model verification of a diesel engine in high and low loading conditions and using fixed combustion model parameters indicate that the difference between the calculation results and the experimental data is less than 5% and the results are consistent, which proves that the model has predictivity. The analysis of the model calculation results indicates that the model can accurately reflect the performance change pattern and regional change characteristics for different working conditions and provide a suitable foundation platform for controlling system combustion performance optimization. In addition, the array algorithm and multi-zone through-operation calculation method were validated in a real-time hardware system test environment. The methods can effectively reduce the multi cylinder multi-zone model simulation time to 30%. The application range of the real-time system model was expanded; thus, this method is very suitable for real-time system calculation.

AB Frost build-up on the fins of the evaporator severely decreases heat transfer and subsequently reduces the performance of the heat pump system. In this paper, a novel frost-free air source heat pump system is proposed, which combines with liquid desiccant dehumidification and closed-circuit regeneration. A test setup for investigating the performance of the proposed system and the corresponding performance indexes are developed to evaluate the system performance under variable working conditions. The effects of key parameters including solution temperature, solution concentration, air flow rate and solution flow rate on the regeneration performance and heating performance of the system are analyzed experimentally. Results show that the optimal mass flow rate ratio of the solution to the air is 1.4 in the regeneration mode, while the ratio of 0.55 is recommended in the heating mode. Additionally, performance comparison between the proposed system and the conventional reverse-cycle defrosting system available in the literature is conducted. It is concluded that the proposed system is superior to the reverse-cycle defrosting system when the ambient temperature is less than 0 degrees C and the relative humidity is higher than 65%.

ID OF-THE-ART; PERMEABILITY
AB Six different processes for the direct methanation of biogas for biomethane production were evaluated regarding their economically optimised operating conditions, their absolute costs and profitability. Detailed process simulations turned out to be important to obtain a solid process design so that a realistic cost estimate is possible. This is necessary since the stated costs in literature vary by a factor of 10 due to the shortage of simulation details. In addition, cost data for the methanation from recent literature are often under-estimated due to the lack of a required second upgrading step (post-upgrading) to reach the demanded gas grid specifications and of additional process equipment. A fixed bed methanation reactor is two times more expensive than a bubbling fluidised bed reactor but due to the dominant share of costs of the electrolysis, costs differences between the whole processes of 5% are less pronounced. It turned out that a gas separation membrane and a second fixed bed, as a post-upgrading step, are equally expensive. However, a gas separation membrane seems to be technically more robust. Biomethane production costs of 10.2 Ct(epsilon)/kWh(total) for processes containing a fluidised bed and of 10.7 Ct(epsilon)/kWh(total) for processes containing a main fixed bed are obtained. As a consequence, the corresponding processes are profitable until an electricity price of 6.0 Ct(epsilon)/kWh(el) and 5.3 Ct(epsilon)/kWh(el) without considering the extra revenues from process heat and oxygen. Furthermore, the profitability of the processes increases with the methane content in the biogas. Considering extra revenues and a concentration increase of 10% for methane in the biogas, the maximum electricity price for a profitable process increases by 3 Ct(epsilon)/kWh(el).

AB Ambitious actions focused on rapid defossilisation of today's energy systems require greater urgency, in order to avert unmanageable impacts of climate change. Transitioning to a cost-effective and carbon-neutral energy system in Nigeria and across the globe by the second half of this century is vital. This study explores a paradigmatic pathway to a fully sustainable energy system for Nigeria, by 2050. The research approach is to simulate a cost-optimised transition pathway towards 100% renewable energy based power system for Nigeria, using a linear optimisation model. The model is based on hourly resolution for an entire year. The country researched is structured into 6 sub-regions. The optimisation for each of the 5-year time periods is carried out based on assumed costs and technological status until 2050 for all energy technologies involved. The levelised cost of electricity declines from 54 (sic)/MWh in 2015 to 46 (sic)/MWh in 2050 for the power sector in the Best Policy Scenario and further declines to 35 (sic)/MWh with sector coupling. Whereas, the cost of electricity increased to 75 (sic)/MWh in the Current Policy Scenario without greenhouse gas emission cost. The results clearly reveal that integrating a renewable energy technology mix with a wide variety of storage technologies is the most competitive and least cost electricity option for Nigeria in the mid-term future, as indicated by the Best Policy Scenario. In particular, the compatibility and predominant role of solar photovoltaics and batteries is paramount towards a rapid transition of Nigeria's power sector, due to highly favourable economics. This study concludes with the implications of a stable and supportive policy environment, transitioning to a defossiliated energy system in Nigeria could be achieved in the mid-term future. This study is the first of its kind in full hourly resolution for Nigeria, and demonstrates the need for carrying out detailed analyses in examining gaps in energy transition understanding based on various policy constraints for developing countries in comparable climates.

AB In this paper, a multi-objective optimization of geothermal water desalination plant with ejector refrigeration system is proposed. The multi-objective antlion optimization algorithm is used. Six different optimization scenarios were performed with economic (total investment cost and profit) and thermodynamic (exergy destruction) objectives for refrigerants R11, R114 and R717. Multi-criteria decision making with integrated AHP and PROMETHEE II approach is executed for evaluating the most suitable design project and refrigerant. Besides economic and thermodynamic criteria, three additional environmental criteria were used: ozone depletion potential, global warming potential and toxicity. The sensitivity analysis showed that water desalination plant with R114 refrigerant and coefficient of performance 0.507 is optimal for a wide range of criteria weights. A similar result of the optimal design point is obtained in scenarios where only economic objective functions were considered during the optimization procedure. Furthermore, it is proved that R114 Pareto front is more optimal in comparison with other refrigerants.

AB A Kalina cycle driven by solar energy resource is evaluated by conventional exergy and exergoeconomic analysis methods. Because conventional exergy analyses isn't able to give information about costs of the irreversibilities and investment, advanced exergy is investigated. Based on the conventional exergy analyses, the most exergy destruction occurs in a heater with a value of 94.44 kW. Also the highest exergy efficiencies are related to the separator and turbine with the values of 99.67% and 89.81%, respectively. Advanced exergy analyses demonstrates absorber (1.3 $/h) and one of the pumps (0.009 $/h) have the highest and lowest exergy destruction cost rate, respectively. Also the results show turbine (85.88%) and separator (1.105%) have the highest and lowest exergoeconomic factor, respectively. Finally, in order to determine optimum point of the inlet temperatures and pressure ratio of the pumps and turbine (rotary machines), a parametric study is applied at different stages.

AB Array reconfiguration methods for PV arrays generally follow puzzle based mathematical methods for relocating PV modules. Being size constrained, no array reconfiguration techniques in literature is a reliable solution for effective shade dispersion in large sized PV arrays. Moreover, most of the physical relocation methods do not possess a well-defined and proven methodology to disperse the shade effect of a PV array irrespective of the system architecture. Hence, in this paper, a new two phase method compatible for PV arrays of any size is outlined and tested for effective shade dispersion. Having two different phases in shade dispersion process, the two-phase technology is found highly commendable in relocating PV panels such that illustrious shade dispersion is attained. To confirm its contribution in physical relocation scheme, four shade cases are considered and tested with other methods in literature. Furthermore, based on row current calculation and bypass effect, a quantitative comparison is also performed with popular physical relocation (SuDoKu), electrical reconfiguration (PSO) and conventional (TCT) interconnection schemes. As the results suggest, the fill factor attainment for the proposed two phase method for short wide case, long wide, short narrow and long narrow cases are 72%, 62%, 81% and 75% respectively. Furthermore, except for a single pattern, the power attainment with proposed method has benchmarked minimal of 700 W power improvement compared to TCT in all shade cases.

AB The objective of this work is to compare two cavity receivers for a solar dish concentrator. The spiral and the conical cavities are investigated using a developed thermal model. The analysis is optical, thermal and exergetic for different operating temperatuies and flow rates. The developed thermal model is combined with an optical tool in order to simulate properly the solar dish collector and it is validated for the case of the spiral absorber with experimental results. Every receiver is separated in the different coil and every coil is simulated separately in order to increase the model accuracy. Totally, 13 coils are used for the spiral design and 11 for the conical design. The location of the receiver in every case is optimized in order to achieve maximum optical efficiency. The results show that the conical design leads to a 1.38% increase in the optical efficiency due to the increased intercept factor. The thermal efficiency enhancement with the use of conical design is found to be 5.63% at 100 degrees C and 40.45% at 200 degrees C, while the exergy efficiency enhancement 6.67% at 100 degrees C and 42.06% at 200 degrees C.

AB The ground source heat pump systems with spiral-coil energy piles are promising for building energy saving in high-density cities. However, when applied in heating-dominant buildings, the soil thermal imbalance causes soil temperature decrease and heating performance degradation in long-term operations. To analyze the effect of different influential factors on the soil thermal imbalance, an analytical model for spiral-coil energy pile group under seepage conditions is proposed, considering different heat fluxes of piles and time variation of heat fluxes. A sandbox experiment is used to validate the proposed model, based on which a system model is further established to investigate the long-term performance ground source heat pumps. Results show that (1) the energy piles in the outer layers of the group, at the upstream of the seepage flow direction, with a large pile spacing, or arranged in a line shape exchange more heat with soil; (2) the groundwater effectively alleviates the temperature decreases of soil near the energy piles and located at the upstream; (3) the groundwater flow, a slim pile layout, a large pile spacing, and a short pile length are effective to alleviate the decreases of the outlet fluid temperature and heating efficiency, contributing to higher heating capacities and lower energy consumptions.

AB In this paper, a novel framework for wind speed forecasting is proposed. In the new prediction framework, wavelet transform is firstly adopted to decompose original wind speed history into several sub-series. Then, for low-frequency sub-series, recurrent neural networks are used to extract deeper features, which are fed into suitable machine learning methods for predicting, while others are still predicted by normal methods. Meanwhile, three new hybrid models are established, where support vector machine is taken as the predictor, and the standard recurrent neural network and its variant version: long short term memory neural networks and gated recurrent unit neural networks are employed to extract the deeper features. Four experiments from the real world are conducted through the proposed methods as well as normal algorithms. The results demonstrate that the three new proposed hybrid models based on the novel framework yield more accurate predictions.

AB Biodiesel is an unsurpassed alternative fuel source intended to extend the value to fossil fuels, and the longevity and cleanliness of diesel engines. It reduces the dependence on the foreign fuels and reduces the greenhouse gas emissions due to its closed carbon cycle. The plentiful advantages of biodiesel are overcome by few drawbacks such as the increase in the nitrogen oxide emission, its incompatibility with cold weather conditions, and the regular intervals of engine parts replacement such as fuel filters, fuel tanks and fuel lines due to clogging. There is a further scope for enhancement in fuel properties and to overcome the drawbacks by addition of nano particles as fuel additives. Recent researches on fuel additives indicated the inclusion of nano-sized particles (metallic, non-metallic, oxygenated, organic and combination) with diesel-biodiesel fuel emulsion. The results achieved demonstrated an improvement in the thermophysical properties, enhancement in the heat transfer rate, and stabilization of the fuel mixtures. Also, there was an increase in the engine performance parameters and reduction in the exhaust emissions depending on the dosage of nanofluid additives. This review paper includes the methods for preparation of nanofluids, the stability enhancement of nanofluids by various technique, several characterization methods to find the chemical bonding, nanoparticle shape, and size, dispersion of nano-additives in liquid fuel, the health effects, and applications of nanoparticles in the automotive industry.
   The numerous literature reviewed had some degree of indistinct and inconsistent outcomes. The experimental results from the various researchers were not generalized to reach a general accord regarding this innovative approach of fuel adulteration. The present work summarizes the literature from most recent articles on nano particles as a liquid fuel additive. The effect of dispersion of several nanoparticles on the enhancement in the performance characteristics and reduction in emission of a CI engine fuelled with diesel-biodiesel blends are discussed. The further scope suggests the development of an economically sustainable and feasible nanoparticle additive for diesel and biodiesel fuel. Nevertheless, few obstacles and challenges which have been recognized in this review must be addressed before they can be fully put into practice in the industrial applications.

AB This study reports on a comparative analysis of the influence of linseed oil-derived biodiesel on a compression ignition engine combustion and performance. New findings on particle emission and size distribution are presented and discussed. A low-sulfur commercial diesel fuel and soybean biodiesel were used as a reference. Engine feeding with biodiesel blends leads to slight increase (5-15%) in the maximal pressure rise rate compared to the diesel fuel accompanied by a minor rise in coefficient of variation at low loads. Combustion duration of all studied biodiesel blends is longer compared to the diesel fuel under all operating modes. At low-load operating modes, reduction in particle number concentrations under feeding with blends of the diesel fuel with soybean and linseed-derived biofuels (in 1:1 ratio by volume) is observed in the entire range of measured particle sizes. At high loads, the opposite trend is revealed: in the ultrafine particles size range ( < 90 nm), the measured particle number concentration for the biodiesel blends is substantially higher compared to diesel fuel. In contrast to soybean biodiesel, the linseed-derived blends demonstrated a trend of reduction in nitrogen oxides emission as compared to diesel at higher engine loads.

AB To achieve high volumetric power density, some fuel cell stacks are designed to place fuel/air manifolds within (and penetrate through) the cell plane zone and adopt open outlet manifold. In this paper, a 3D large scale multi physics model of a whole 18-cell stack with the above two structural features is first completed by carefully coupling momentum, mass, energy and quasi electrochemical equations. Then, the generic distribution regularity of the main physics items, which depends on the above two structural features rather than any specific design and parameters, are reported. The result shows that the air flow rate fed to cell unit monotonously increases with increasing cell number as long as the open outlet of air flow path is adopted. Only 0.41 times the average air flow rate fed to each cell unit can pass through the 1st cell layer; and its value will greatly reduce when the stack scale increases. Placing manifolds within cell plane zone causes complex air/fuel flow distributions over the electrode surface; and adopting cross flow arrangement pattern can relieve the local temperature rising risk. The highest stack temperature appears around the crossing corner of both air and fuel flow exhaust headers in the 1st cell layer.

AB A technical and economic feasibility study of multiple energy piles (EPs) for a ground-coupled heat pump (GCHP) system is presented in this paper. The GCHP system energy performance and life-cycle cost (LCC) are evaluated, it is found that the system energy output (heating and cooling) could meet a domestic building comfortable environment requirement with the annual average COP of 3.63 and EER of 4.62. The LCC evaluation indicates that the system net present value (NPV) is approximately 26,095 at the market discount rate of 8.75% for a 20-year operating period. Moreover, the payback period of the GCHP system is approximately 4.31 years, which is sensitive to the main parameters including electricity price, capital investment and energy generation. Furthermore, the low discount rate and high energy generation are beneficial to the GCHP system with the high NPV and cash flows. The capital price of the system should be regulated to a lower level for the larger market potential.

AB Compressed air energy storage is a useful means of storage since the stored compressed air can be used at any time as a source of mechanical energy for power production. However, if the heat generated during compression is not utilized, the process efficiency will be low, and consequently, additional heat is required to avoid frost formation during the expansion process. The generated heat during compression can be stored in the form of sensible heat in the wall of the high-pressure tank at an elevated temperature. However, this method is undesirable due to (1) less air can be compressed at higher temperatures and (2) heavy insulation would be required to prevent heat loss to the environment over extended time. A solution to this problem is to use Phase Change Material (PCM) which has a melting temperature close to ambient, and hence the heat could be stored as latent heat of melting. PCMs have low thermal conductivity and hence requires to have large contact area with the compressed air so as to be able to release its latent heat rapidly during rapid expansion. This could be achieved through the use of microencapsulated PCM, which provides very large surface area. In this work, a high-pressure tank (2 L, 200 bar) was used for air storage while the commercial microcapsules; Micronal (R) DS 5038X was used as the latent heat storage material. Both theoretical simulation and experimental measurements made on the system show that the use of PCM microcapsules reduces the maximum increase in air temperature from approximately 45 degrees C to 27 degrees C (150 g, Micronal (R) DS 5038X) during charging. While during discharging, the maximum decrease in temperature was reduced from 48 degrees C to 28 degrees C, which prevented air temperature from dropping to below 0 degrees C.

AB Since the heat pipe has no parasitic energy consumption, it is an important method for cooling the photovoltaic. In this paper, a novel type of atmospheric plate thermosyphon (APT) cooling system has been designed, which can be used for the heat dissipation of the single or low concentrated solar cells. In the experiments, the non condensable gas (NCG) was collected by a gas reservoir. The coolant, ethanol, formed a liquid film on the porous medium and directly cooled the photovoltaic panel. The effect of various parameters such as heat flux density, tilt angle and inlet temperature have been studied. The results demonstrated that APT cooling system could effectively reduce the temperature of PV cells, and the higher heat flux density was, the shorter start-up time. The temperature of evaporator was uniform, and the larger inclined angle was, the greater surface temperature difference which maximumly was 5.6 degrees C. The thermal resistance at the evaporator was between 0.00486 and 0.02368K/W.

AB A combined cooling, heating and power system driven by marine gas turbine waste heat is proposed. The proposed CCHP system includes a supercritical CO2 (S-O-2) recompression cycle, two transcritical CO2 (T-O-2) refrigeration cycles and a steam generator. Comprehensive thermodynamic and exergoeconomic analyses are performed for the supercritical CO2 recompression cycle, transcritical CO2 refrigeration cycle and the overall system. Considering the importance of compactness and cost to the ship, the total product unit cost and total heat exchanger area per unit exergy output are proposed as the objective functions of the system optimization. Parametric analyses are conducted to study the effects of key operating parameters including the pressure ratio of air compressor, S-CO2 compressor inlet pressure, pressure ratio of S-CO2 cycle, split ratio of S-CO2 cycle and TCO2 compressor outlet pressure on the total product unit cost and total heat exchanger area per unit exergy output. The optimum system parameters are obtained through the multi-objective optimization method based on the GA (genetic algorithm). The optimization result shows that the optimum values of total product unit cost and total heat exchanger area per unit exergy output are 10.0526 $/GJ and 0.1755 m(2)/kW, respectively. The result also indicates that by using the CCHP system, 4.9901 MW of power, 0.584 MW of heat capacity, and 0.627 MW of refrigeration capacity can be recovered from the exhaust gas (with the mass flow rate of 95.6102 kg/s, temperature of 466 degrees C and the major compositions of nitrogen 74.45%, oxygen 15.74%, carbon dioxide 4.77% and water 5.04% by mass). Furthermore, the superiority of the CCHP system is verified through comparative analyses from the viewpoints of exergoeconomic and compactness.

AB With the rapid growth of installed capacity of photovoltaic power systems, status monitoring and fault diagnosis of PV arrays becomes increasingly important for improving the energy conversion and maintenance efficiency. In recent years, many machine learning algorithms were successfully applied to automatically build fault diagnosis models using the fault data samples. However, most of them suffer overfitting problem and the generalization performance is still limited. In this paper, the random forest (RF) ensemble learning algorithm is explored for the detection and diagnosis of PV arrays early faults (including line-line faults, degradation, open circuit, and partial shading), which combines multiple learning algorithms to achieve a superior diagnostic performance. The proposed RF based fault diagnosis model only takes the real-time operating voltage and string currents of the PV arrays as the fault features, which is irrelevant to the environment conditions. In addition, a grid-search method is used to optimize the parameters of the RF model by minimizing the out-of-bag error estimation, so as to improve the fault diagnosis model. In order to obtain sufficient fault data samples, comprehensive fault experiments are conducted on both a Simulink based simulated PV system and a laboratory PV system. The simulation and experimental results both demonstrate that the optimized RF based fault diagnosis model can achieve a high overall detection and diagnosis performance. Moreover, the comparison results indicate that the generalization performance of the proposed RF based model is better than the one of the decision tree based model. Therefore, the proposed optimal RF based method is an effective and efficient alternative to detect and classify the faults of PV arrays. Furthermore, the proposed RF based fault diagnosis model is successfully integrated into a Matlab based real-time monitoring system prototype developed for the laboratory PV system, which validates the practicability as well.

AB Combination of binary components used for absorption refrigeration systems as ammonia-water can also be applied as working mixture for power generation in a Kalina Cycle, providing an interesting option in the use of energy sources at low temperatures. Using this possibility in a power-cooling cogeneration system, Kalina Cycle (KC) was proposed to be integrated in an ammonia-water absorption refrigeration system (AARS) of 1269 kW of cooling at 219 K, in order to take better advantage of the available energy from a steam generator in an industrial plant, used as a case study. The AARS uses water steam as hot utility, after the expansion in a pressure reducing valve from higher pressure. Applying exergy analysis, it was verified that the combined KC-AARS, besides the power generation, can decrease the exergy destruction in the AARS. For that, due to the very low working temperatures, the AARS involving double absorbers and evaporators, condenser and expansion valves in a complex system and its peculiarities were practically preserved at lower pressure levels, integrating the KC basically in the higher pressure levels, which is a very interesting proposal for existent systems. The results showed the possibility to reduce the exergy destruction in 43.3%, from 1614 to 915.8 kW, and to produce 493 kW of power generation. In addition, increases in the coefficient of performance from 0.256 to 0.376, energy efficiency of refrigeration from 0.297 to 0.360 and exergy efficiency from 0.185 to 0.468 were reached at 4.7 MPa of working pressure.

AB Heterogeneous catalyst plays a dual role in the transesterification reaction owing to the advantages of separation and reusability. Recently, heterogeneous catalysts derived from renewable sources have gotten more attention. The renewable resources described include shells, bones, ashes from plant/tree, natural sources, large-scale industrial wastes, etc. Advantageously, catalysts prepared from these materials could make the biodiesel product more sustainable, environmentally friendly and cost-effective. The purpose of this work is to review some recent developments on the heterogeneous catalyst derived from renewable resource for the transesterification reaction. Furthermore, the current advances and the future perspectives of catalysts from renewable resources will be presented. Hopefully, this review will offer some perspective and guidelines of the future research and development for renewable resources derived catalysts.

AB Effluent of biogas digestate, a waste stream with serious environmental problems, was used to pretreat rice straw in order to improve biofuel production. To investigate the effect of components presented in this waste stream and compare the results, water was also applied at the same conditions for the pretreatment. The straw was pretreated at 130, 160, and 190 degrees C for 30 and 60 min and subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis, simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF), liquid anaerobic digestion (L-AD), and dry anaerobic digestion (D-AD). The highest improvements in hydrolysis and ethanol yield were 100 and 125%, achieved from the straw pretreated with effluent of biogas digestate at 190 degrees C for 60 min. The best methane yield was obtained through L-AD and D-AD of straw pretreated at 190 degrees C and 30 min with effluent of biogas digestate, resulting in 24 and 26% enhancements in produced methane. However, treatment with water had no significant effect on methane yield. Compositional and FTIR analyses indicated hemicellulose omission through the treatment under severe conditions. Furthermore, SEM images showed major enhancement in straw porosity by the pretreatment.

AB The integration of Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) technology in large scale fossil-fuelled power plant is one of the best options to promote the necessary transition to a totally renewable electric system starting from the present system. This work provides a complete overview of the possible integration of CSP systems into a real 320 MW coal-fired steam power plant aimed at fuel saving. To this end, detailed off-design models of the existing steam power plant are first built and validated using experimental data measured on the field. Design and off design models of solar section are then added considering several placement points. Unlike most of the literature, all technical constraints associated with maximum and minimum load of the existing components are also taken into account. The most efficient integration points proposed in the literature plus four new ones are considered in combination with parabolic trough collectors, linear Fresnel collectors or solar towers, for a total of twenty-two different design options. The best integration point results to be in the high-pressure preheater/s: (i) the highest hybrid thermal efficiency (42.67%) is obtained using parabolic trough/molten salt collectors to generate additional high-pressure steam from the drainage water of the last two parallel preheaters (HPH3), (ii) similar thermal efficiencies are achieved in a wide range of solar share (up to 9.1%) by including parabolic through/thermal oil collectors to heat part of the feedwater stream of HPH3 and (iii) 15,400 tons per year of coal can be saved when the solar field area is approximately four times as much the area of the existing coal storage area.

AB Large-scale industrial wind turbines are well developed and widely implemented to harness kinetic energy of air flow for power production. However, little attention and effort was paid on developing miniature energy-efficient wind harvesters. In this work, a miniature harvester driven by air flow was manufactured by applying 3D printing technique and experimentally evaluated in a closed-loop wind tunnel. To simulate the experiment and to optimize the wind harvester design, three-dimensional numerical study was conducted. The model was validated by comparing the experimental results with the numerical ones first. Parametric study was then experimentally and numerically performed to examine the critical roles of (1) type of central part, (2) presence of end plates, (3) harvester length, (4) harvester diameter, (5) number of blades and (6) harvester installation orientation on static and dynamic performances of the designed harvesters. The optimal design was achieved according to the overall energy conversion efficiency, and the maximum efficiency achieved was eta(max) = 6.59%.

AB Oman is a country characterised by high solar availability, yet very little electricity is produced using solar energy. As the residential sector is the largest consumer of electricity in Oman, we develop a novel approach, using houses in Muscat as a case study, to assess the potential of implementing roof-top solar PV/battery technologies, that operate without recourse to the electricity grid. Such systems target the complete decarbonisation of electricity demand per household and are defined in this study as grid-independent systems. The approach adopted starts with a technical assessment of grid-independent systems that evaluates the characteristics of the solar panel and the battery facility required to provide grid-independence. This is then compared to a similar grid-connected system and any techno-economic targets necessary to enhance the feasibility of residential roof-top PV systems in Muscat are identified. Such an analysis was achieved through developing a detailed techno-economic mathematical model describing four sub-systems; the solar panel DC source, the grid independent sub-system, the grid-connected sub-system and the economic sub-system. The model was implemented in gPROMS and uses real hourly weather and climate conditions matched with real demand data, over a simulated period of 20 years. The results indicate that, in the context of the system studied, grid-independent PV systems are not feasible. However, combined with a sufficiently high electricity price, grid-independent systems can become economically feasible only with significant reductions in battery costs (> 90% reductions).

AB Caloric cooling has significant potential to become an environmentally friendly and highly efficient alternative to conventional vapor-compression technology, however, this refrigeration method still remains in the stage of research. Adoption has been limited mainly due to the very high cost of cooling systems components. One possibility for reducing the price while improving system performance is the stimulation of a refrigerant material with more than one physical field; multicaloric refrigerators. Here we show, for the first time, the multicaloric effect determined for combined magnetocaloric and mechanocaloric phenomena. The effect was demonstrated using the Ni-Mn-In Heusler alloy and novel test system. The obtained temperature change is the sum of the independently measured phenomena. The multicaloric material stimulation can achieve a given result with 75% lower magnetic field compared to only the magnetocaloric transition and 30% lower stress relative to solely the mechanocaloric effect. This work proves the great promise of caloric refrigeration and provides a way to better understand the multicaloric temperature response of materials.

AB Carbon deposition is one of the major degradation sources, which reduces the activity of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) and it can even cause irreversible cell degradation. In order to counteract this phenomenon and thus to extend the SOFC lifetime, development of effective cell-protecting strategies for carbon re-gasification and restoring of the cell performance is of crucial importance, since other methods considering prevention of this degradation phenomenon can mean an increased system complexity or reduced system performance. In the literature there is very limited data relating to the performance of SOFCs after the carbon removal process has been executed. This study aims to analyze carbon removal techniques and moreover their effect on the SOFC performance as well as possibilities for industrial application. Various innovative approaches for carbon re gasification are scrutinized and detailed explained within this study on 20 samples, which further help to provide potential carbon removal procedures relevant for industrial SOFC systems.

AB Energy storage systems (ESS) are a structural solution for the integration of renewable energy systems. To plan the optimal combination of ESS, storage expansion planning approaches are commonly used. They tend to focus on balancing the energy fluctuations from renewable technologies but are usually blind to the need for specific additional services required for dealing with forecast errors. Hence, they underestimate the real operating costs of the future power system and lead to suboptimal investment recommendations. In response, we propose a multi-service storage expansion approach.
   A linear programming optimization is developed, LEELO, to find the optimal investments in a 100% renewable system (based on solar photovoltaic and wind power) deciding on renewable generators and storage systems. In our formulation, we explicitly model the provisioning of power reserves and energy autonomy as additional services. A case study applies our model to Chile considering four regions and the (existing) hydro-power park, for a complete year with an hourly resolution. We systematically assess how our novel multi-service planning differs from conventional energy-based planning in terms of total costs, operation, and investment decisions (with a focus on ESS).
   Considering power reserves and energy autonomy reveals on average 20% higher costs that otherwise would not be captured in the expansion planning process. Regarding operation, ESS show only slight differences in the two planning models. All ESS participate in the provision of energy. As might be expected, batteries are the main provider of (short-term) power reserves, assisted by pumped-hydro, whereas hydrogen storage is responsible for providing (long-term) energy autonomy. However, the storage investment decisions differ significantly between both models. In our multi-service model, the attained power capacities and energy capacities are up to 1.6 and 3.2 times larger, respectively than in conventional planning. The resulting storage mix changes even more strongly: a general shift towards hydrogen systems is observed. Mainly batteries are substituted, while pumped hydro capacities stay relatively constant. The trend of the above results is consistent for various scenarios of wind and photovoltaic generation and for sensitivities of service parameters.
   Our findings underline the importance of modeling multi-services in the planning of renewable-based power systems.

AB A highly efficient regenerative thermal management system of combined cycle engine can realize the energy balance between the high power requirement of the vehicle and severe thermal environment of the engine, therefore, the heat sink utilization efficiency of supercritical hydrocarbon fuel in regenerative thermal protection system needs to be improved. In this paper, an innovative self-adaptive method using mini-structure to improve the mass flow rate distribution in thermal protection system with parallel cooling channels is proposed based on the engine's extremely nonuniform thermal load. The effectiveness of this novel method is numerically studied, and the effects of adaptive mini-structure's location and number are also investigated. The results demonstrate that the existence of adaptive mini-structure improves the mass flow uniformity between parallel channels by forming a jet flow through the mini-structure and the backward recirculation region created by the jet flow, these two characteristics adaptively change the flow area in the low heat flux channel and create a virtual throat after the adaptive mini-structure which decreases the mass flow rate in low heat flux channel and achieves better uniformity. Among the various cases in the present paper, the location with X = 200 mm improves the uniformity of parallel channels with 10% deviation of heat flux from 26.6% to 78.8%, and for the 20% deviation of heat flux, the uniformity is improved from 23.5% to 63.4%.

AB A multi-criteria optimization for a biomass gasification-integrated combined cooling, heating, and power (CCHP) system based on life-cycle assessment is carried out. The criteria comprise primary energy saving ratio (PESR), total cost saving ratio (TCSR), and CO2 emission reduction ratio (CERR). The overall-performance criterion, Cl, is obtained with Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solutions (TOPSIS). Results show that the Cl reaches its maximum when the nominal electric output is 1572.8 kW, the biomass feedstock type is wood pellet, and the operation strategy is following the electric load (FEL). The PESR, TCSR, CERR, and Cl are 0.101, 0.271, 0.498, and 0.867, respectively. By comparing with reference systems, it is found that in FEL mode, the system is improved because of higher energy utilization efficiency and better use of economic and environmental advantages of biomass. In following the thermal load (FTL) mode, economic performance is compromised for optimal overall performance. Sensitivity analysis is carried out to find out the effect of variation of various parameters on optimization results. It is found that the variation of a single-aspect parameter could affect the system performance on all aspects. The variation of primary energy consumption per unit electricity from the grid (pec(en,g)) has the greatest effect on optimization results. The corresponding variation ranges of PESR, TCSR, and CERR owing to its variation are from -0.063/0.231/0.473 to 0.284/0.295/0.624 and from -0.029/0.101/0.314 to 0.194/0.123/0.379 in FEL and FTL modes.

AB The effect of different fuel injection strategies for a CI internal combustion engine running on n-butanol/diesel blends is reported in this study. n-Butanol was blended in proportions of 5%, 10% and 20% (by vol.) and engine performance was compared with those obtained from commercially available diesel fuel. The effects of fuel injection pressure [HP], start of injection [SOU and split injection ratios were explored in this work. A single cylinder common rail direct injection engine running at a speed of 1050 +/- 30 rpm was used for performance analysis. Initially, a baseline set of experiments were performed for all the fuel blends with the engine operating at 800 bars fuel injection pressure [FIP], 9 degrees BTDC SOI, 3.48 BMEP and with 0% split injection. In-cylinder pressure, heat release rate, exhaust gas temperature and NOx emission were recorded for all the experiments. Additionally, for the base case, indicated gross engine performance parameters like BSFC and BTE were also determined. Subsequently, a parametric study of three different injection strategies was performed and variations in the indicated parameters and NOx emissions were thoroughly analysed. Significant reduction in NOx emission due to n-butanol blending, retarded start of injection and split injection were observed and reported as part of this work. A skeletal n-dodecane/n-butanol mechanism was used to investigate the causes for NOx emissions decrease due to the addition of n-butanol to diesel fuel. Qualitative insights gained from combustion kinetics simulations in an idealized homogeneous combustion model are discussed.

AB The development of new energy efficient components and complex energy concepts in recent years has heightened the need to design advanced control strategies. The main objective of this research is to develop a control strategy for building energy systems to save primary energy by applying the concept of multi-agent systems. Most of the advanced control strategies have been developed to be energy efficient, while their objectives are obtained from energy analysis. However, an energy analysis is unable to provide information on the quality of energy streams flowing through a system. In this study, exergy is selected as the objective of the optimization. To reach the goal of this research, an agent-based control for building energy systems using the exergy cost functions is developed. Agent-based control, which takes into account the interactions among the components of the system, offers a promising solution to the need for more advanced control strategies for complex building energy systems. The classical agent-based control developed in this study is combined with model predictive control, which leads to a novel hybrid agent-based model predictive control for the optimization of advanced building energy systems from an exergy point of view. For evaluation purposes, a case study is defined and modeled, which is controlled by a reference control and the agent-based under the same circumstances through software-in-the-loop simulations. The results show that the agent-based control is able to reduce the primary energy consumption by 2 percent while maintaining the room air temperature at the same level of the reference case.

DE Object detection; Region proposal generation; Convolutional neural

AB The Faster Region-based Convolutional Network (Faster R-CNN) was recently proposed achieving outstanding performance for object detection. Specially, a Region Proposal Network (RPN) is designed to efficiently predict region proposals with a wide range of scales and aspect ratios in Faster R-CNN. Nevertheless, once the number and quality of region proposals generated by RPN are not ideal the object detection performance of Faster R-CNN is affected. In this paper, multiple strategies are applied to address these limitations and improve RPN. Hence, a novel architecture for region proposal generation is presented which is named as Multi-strategy Region Proposal Network (MSRPN). Four improvements are presented in MSRPN. Firstly, a novel skip-layer connection network is designed for combining multi-level features and boosting the ability of pooling layers. Thereupon, the quality of region proposals is strengthened. Secondly, improved anchor boxes are introduced with adaptive aspect ratio and evenly distributed interval of selected scales. In this way, the number of predicted region proposals for detection is seriously reduced and the efficiency of object localization is increased. Particularly, the capability of small object detection is enhanced by applying the first and second improvements. Thirdly, classification layer and regression layer are unified as a single convolutional layer. Furthermore, the model complexity of output layer is reduced. Thus, the speed of training and testing is accelerated. Fourthly, the bounding box regression part of multi-task loss function in RPN is improved. Consequently, the performance of bounding box regression is promoted.
   In the experiment, MSRPN is compared with the Fast Region-based Convolutional Network (Fast R-CNN), Faster R-CNN, Inside-Outside Net (ION), Multi-region CNN (MR-CNN) and HyperNet approaches. MSRPN achieves the state-of-the-art mean average precision (mAP) of 78.9%, 74.8% and 32.1% on PASCAL VOC 2007, 2012 and MS COCO data sets with the deep VGG-16 model, surpassing other five object detection methods. Simultaneously, the above experiment results are obtained by MSRPN with only 150 region proposals per image. Additionally, MSRPN gets excellent performance on small object detection. Furthermore, MSRPN runs at 6 fps which is faster than other methods. In conclusion, the MSRPN method can provide important support for the intelligent object detection systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Classification and localization of focal epileptic seizures provide a proper diagnostic procedure for epilepsy patients. Visual identification of seizure activity from long-term electroencephalography (EEG) is tedious, time-consuming and leads to human error. Therefore, there is a need for an automated classification system.
   Methods: In this paper, we introduce a tool called CADFES: computerized automated detection of focal epileptic seizures. For the study, total 41.66 hours of EEG data from the Bern-Barcelona database was used. Set of 28 features were extracted from time, frequency, and statistical domain and significant features were selected using neighborhood component analysis (NCA). In NCA, optimization of regularization parameter ensured better classification accuracy (less classification loss) with seven features. The performance of the algorithm was assessed using support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbor (K-NN), random forest and adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) classifiers.
   Results: Experimental results revealed sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive rate, negative predictive rate, and area under the curve of 97.6%, 94.4%, 96.1%, 92.9%, 98.8% and 0.96 respectively using the SVM classifier. Finally, MATLAB based software tool referred to as CADFES was introduced for automated classification of focal and non-focal seizures. Comparison results ensure that proposed study is superior to existing methods. Hence, it is expected to perform better at the hospitals for automated classification of focal epileptic seizures in real-time. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB It is crucial to represent the semantic information of a document in sentiment classification. Various semantic information representation models have been proposed, however existing approaches have their setbacks. Notable weaknesses among these are: (1) tradition VSM methods, completely ignore the semantic information; (2) averaging word embedding methods, cannot depict the synthetical semantic meaning of the given document; (3) neural network methods, require complex structure and are notoriously difficult to be trained. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a simple but novel method which we call bag of meta-words (BoMW). In our method, the semantic information of the document is indicated by a meta-words vector in which every single meta-word element denotes particular semantic information. Especially, these meta-words are extracted from pre-trained word embeddings through two different but complemental models, naive interval meta-words (NIM) and feature combination meta-words (FCM). In general, our new model BoMW is as simple as traditional VSM model but it can capture the synthetical semantic meanings of the document. Numerous experiments on two benchmarks (IMDB dataset and Pang's dataset) are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, and the results show that the performance of our method can exceed the traditional VSM methods and methods using pre- trained word embedding.

AB The optimization of the two-echelon logistics delivery and pickup network (2E-LDPN) is a strategical and tactical task which can efficiently be achieved by establishing cooperative alliances. Under the coordination of logistics services providers or logistics facilities of the existing network, high operating costs caused by cross and long distance transportation can be reduced via the inclusive reorganization of the entire network. In order to minimize the total cost, this study simultaneously considers semitrailer truck and vehicle sharing, and establishes a linear mathematical model capable of interpreting real world practices under single or multiple alliances scenarios. An Improved Particle Swarm Optimization (IPSO) algorithm and the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm are reasonably combined into a hybrid meta heuristics to solve the cooperative 2E-LDPN optimization problem. This algorithm combines the merits of IPSO and ACO with local and global search capabilities, and redistributes customer zones on the basis of region partitioning solutions in order to rationalize transportation activities. Finally, an Improved Shapley value model is applied to guarantee profits allocation's fairness and is proved reliable in term of alliance stability. Empirical results out of a case study in Chongqing city show that the IPSO-ACO hybrid algorithm is superior to three well-known algorithms on the cost solution and the number of iterations. Using the Improved Shapley value model and strictly monotonic path (SMP) selection principles, optimal adhesion sequences for two alliances and a grand alliance are yielded. The implemented transition from two sub-alliances based network to the grand alliance is in line with real-world's practices and provides decision makers with a useful tool for the design of cooperative alliances. In addition, the proposed cooperation strategy and profit allocation method enable companies to increase cost savings and the logistics network's efficiency. Besides, semitrailer truck and vehicle sharing as feature of collaboration conditional clauses reduces the size of transportation fleets, and promotes greener logistics operations.

AB This article presents a variable neighborhood search (VNS) algorithm for the consistent vehicle routing problem (ConVRP). ConVRP is a variant of the vehicle routing problem (VRP). In ConVRP, vehicle routes must be designed for multiple days, and each customer must be visited by the same driver at approximately an identical time on each day. VNS is an efficient algorithmic framework and is widely used. The proposed algorithm consists of two stages. In the first stage, VNS is applied to obtain approximately optimized solutions. The solutions obtained might be infeasible. If a solution is of acceptable quality, the second stage is applied to make it feasible and optimize it further. Several techniques are employed to reduce computation time of the local search stage. A special shaking method is introduced and proofed to be more effective than ordinary methods by experiments. A new method for computing time difference excess is proposed to solve the problem that change of time difference excess caused by operations on an individual day is not obvious. The proposed algorithm is tested on the benchmark ConVRP data set and compared with extant ConVRP approaches from the literature. The results demonstrate that VNS outperforms all the extant ConVRP approaches in terms of quality of solutions obtained. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The flow-shop scheduling problem with blocking constraints has received an increasing concern recently. However, multiple scheduling criteria are rarely considered simultaneously in most research. Therefore, in this paper, a multi-objective blocking flow-shop scheduling problem (MOBFSP) that minimizes the makespan and total tardiness simultaneously is investigated. To address this problem, a multi-objective discrete invasive weed optimization (MODIWO) algorithm is proposed. In the proposed MODIWO, a high quality and diversified initial population is firstly constructed via two heuristics and varying weighed values. Then, a reference line-based reproduction and a sliding insertion-based spatial dispersal are developed to guide the global exploration and local exploitation of algorithm. Meanwhile, to enhance intensification search in local region, a self-adaption phase is introduced, which is implemented by a Pareto-based two stage local search with speedup mechanism. Furthermore, a new competitive exclusion strategy is also embedded to construct a superior population for the next generation. Finally, extensive computational experiments and comparisons with several recent state-of-the-art algorithms are carried out based on the well-known benchmark instances. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed MODIWO in solving the considered MOBFSP. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, a new texture descriptor based on the local neighborhood intensity difference is proposed for content based image retrieval (CBIR). For computation of texture features like Local Binary Pattern (LBP), the center pixel in a 3 x 3 window of an image is compared with all the remaining neighbors, one pixel at a time to generate a binary bit pattern. It ignores the effect of the adjacent neighbors of a particular pixel for its binary encoding and also for texture description. The proposed method is based on the concept that neighbors of a particular pixel hold significant amount of texture information that can be considered for efficient texture representation for CBIR. The main impact of utilizing the mutual relationship among adjacent neighbors is that we do not rely on the sign of the intensity difference between central pixel and one of its neighbors (1;) only, rather we take into account the sign of difference values between and its adjacent neighbors along with the central pixels and same set of neighbors of This makes our pattern more resistant to illumination changes. Moreover, most of the local patterns including LBP concentrates mainly on the sign information and thus ignores the magnitude. The magnitude information which plays an auxiliary role to supply complementary information of texture descriptor, is integrated in our approach by considering the mean of absolute deviation about each pixel from its adjacent neighbors. Taking this into account, we develop a new texture descriptor, named as Local Neighborhood Intensity Pattern (LNIP) which considers the relative intensity difference between a particular pixel and the center pixel by considering its adjacent neighbors and generate a sign and a magnitude pattern. Finally, the sign pattern (LNIPS) and the magnitude pattern (LNIPM) are concatenated into a single feature descriptor to generate a more effective feature descriptor. The proposed descriptor has been tested for image retrieval on four databases, including three texture image databases - Brodatz texture image database, MIT VisTex database and Salzburg texture database and one face database - AT&T face database. The precision and recall values observed on these databases are compared with some state of -art local patterns. The proposed method showed a significant improvement over many other existing methods.

   using subspace clustering for epidemiological data

AB Objective: We propose an intelligent system that assists epidemiology experts in analysing the data of a population-based epidemiological study, in identifying relevant variables for an outcome and subpopulations with increased disease prevalence, and in validating the findings concerning variables and subpopulations in a further, expert-specified cohort. At present, the study of an outcome on a population-based cohort is hypothesis-driven, i.e. the expert must specify the variables to be studied. Our approach rather operates in a data-driven, semi-automated way, enabling the expert to identify variables of relevance and generate hypotheses on them.
   Methods: Our system DIVA supports the Discovery, Inspection and VAlidation of subpopulations with increased prevalence of an outcome, without requiring parameter tuning. DIVA takes as input the cohort of an epidemiological population-based study with all variables specified in the study's protocol, as well as inputs from the expert on the similarity of a small number of cohort participants. DIVA uses semi supervised subspace clustering and subspace construction to identify sets of variables - subspaces - that promote participant similarity with respect to the outcome and with respect to the expert inputs, and then discovers subpopulations with increased outcome prevalence in those subspaces (DIVA module "DRESS"). DIVA uses visual analytics techniques to assist the expert in juxtaposing, filtering and inspecting the characteristics of these subpopulations (web-based DIVA module "D-INSPECTOR"). If the expert has access to a second cohort on a comparable population, DIVA aligns the cohort used for discovery to this second cohort, and then checks whether the subpopulations found in the original cohort are also present in the second one (DIVA module "VALIDATOR").
   Results: We applied DIVA to the third wave (SHIP-2) of the SHIP-CORE cohort of the Study of Health in Pomerania (Volzke et al., 2011) for the liver disorder "hepatic steatosis", and on the first wave (TREND-0) of the SHIP-TREND cohort of the same study for the thyroid gland disorder "goitre". We found that most of the subpopulations extracted automatically, and subsequently ranked and filtered by the modules of DIVA, had significantly higher disease prevalence than the general population. We varied the amount of inputs needed from the expert to drive the subpopulation extraction process and found that a very small amount of information, namely the outcome of as few as 4 cohort participants, is sufficient for the identification of several relevant variables and subpopulations. We used a subset of TREND-0 for the validation on goitre and the complete TREND-0 for the validation on hepatic steatosis and found that the significant difference in prevalence for the identified subpopulation also holds in the validation data.
   Conclusions: We have shown that DIVA discovers subpopulations and variables of importance with respect to an outcome, while requiring a very small amount of expert inputs. Each combination of variables and each subpopulation corresponds to a hypothesis, the validation of which would have required substantial human effort. Thus, DIVA allows for a more effective exploitation of population-based data, not fully automated but driven by the expert and without the need for technical parameter tuning.
   A shortcoming of DIVA design is the demand of a specific type of expert inputs, namely "constraints" on the similarity of pairs of participants. Currently, we generate the constraints with a naive utility that is based on random sampling, but we work on the development of an interactive algorithm that would allow the epidemiology expert to inspect a small choice of study participant and give statements on their similarity.
   The present version of DIVA considers a single wave of the cohort data, ignoring the evolution of the population during the horizon of the study. Hence, subspace and subpopulation discovery do not take account of changes in the importance of variables. We currently work on the incorporation of algorithms that derive additional variables from the longitudinal data and use them in the Discovery module. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

While game cross-efficiency is developed as a remedy for weight multiplicity in the original cross-efficiency and peer-evaluation, we improve its use as a tool for portfolio selection. In our analysis, each financial asset is viewed as a player competing for investment funds through boosting its ranking compared to its opponents. Thus, a set of unique Nash equilibrium DEA scores to shares are provided. In addition to unique rank among financial assets, we suggest the deviation from the equilibrium rating score, the maverick index, as a consistent risk measure, that can be used as a good indicator for sensitivity to environment volatility in portfolio management. The empirical part employs a large database of European firms listed in Paris Stock Exchange to demonstrate that our approach can constitute a promising tool for stock portfolio selection. We show that the resulting portfolio is well diversified and yields higher risk-adjusted returns than other benchmark portfolios for a 6-year sample period from 2010 to 2015. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Mobile application (app) websites such as Google Play and AppStore allow users to review their downloaded apps. Such reviews can be useful for app users, as they may help users make an informed decision; such reviews can also be potentially useful for app developers, if they contain valuable information concerning user needs and requirements. However, in order to unleash the value of app reviews for mobile app development, intelligent mining tools that can help discern relevant reviews from irrelevant ones must be provided. This paper surveys the state of the art in the development of such tools and techniques behind them. To gain insight into the maturity of the current support mining tools, the paper will also find out what app development information these tools have discovered and what challenges they are facing. The results of this survey can inform the development of more effective and intelligent app review mining techniques and tools. Crown Copyright (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper presents an approach to fault diagnosis with online detection of novel faults and automatic learning using fuzzy clustering techniques. In the off-line learning stage, the classifier is trained to diagnose the known faults and the normal operation state using the Density Oriented Fuzzy C-Means and the Kernel Fuzzy C-Means algorithms. In this stage, the historical data previously selected by experts, are firstly pre-processed to eliminate outliers and reduce the confusion in the classification process by using the Density Oriented Fuzzy C-Means algorithm. Later on, the Kernel Fuzzy C-Means algorithm is used for achieving greater separability among the classes and reducing the classification errors. Finally, the optimization of the two parameters used by these algorithms in the training stage is developed by using a bio-inspired optimization algorithm, namely the differential evolution. After the training, the classifier is used online (online diagnosis stage) in order to classify the new observations that are collected from the process. In this stage, the detection of novel faults based on density by using the DOFCM algorithm is applied. The algorithm analyzes the observations belonging to a window of time which were not classified into the known classes and it is determined if they are a new class or outliers. If a new class is identified, a procedure is developed to incorporate it to the known classes set. The proposed approach was validated using the Development and Application of Methods for Actuator Diagnosis in Industrial Control Systems (DAMADICS) benchmark. The results obtained indicate the feasibility of the proposed method. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This article seeks to expand how conflict is classified in Evidence Theory, which is also known as Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST). Therefore, alternatives for classifying conflict under DST are discussed and a new approach is proposed based on the PROMETHEE method. To illustrate the use of this approach proposed, a numerical example from the literature on this topic is considered. The results obtained by comparing this proposal and the approach suggested in the literature indicate consistency in the classification. Thus, this novel approach enables the analysis of conflict in DST to be broadened to include decision-makers (DMs) who are more familiar with the structure of the PROMETHEE method. This method includes several intra-criteria preference functions and considers different thresholds within the scale. In addition to a new approach for classifying conflict under DST, this article proposes an adaptation to the disaggregation model based on linear programming in the literature, from which the parameters of the model can be generated using examples of conflict defined by the DM. The approach proposed uses this aggregated information from the DM and disaggregates it in order to define the parameters of the model, and results in a multicriteria analysis of conflict in Evidence Theory.

AB The increase in mortality rate due to life-threatening diseases has become an issue of concern in today's world. Early detection and diagnosis of diseases thus becomes necessary to reduce the severity of their side effects. Computational intelligence techniques like rare association rule mining can be extensively used for the analysis of diseases. This paper introduces an efficient technique to identify the symptoms and risk factors for three adverse diseases: cardiovascular disease, hepatitis and breast cancer, in terms of rare association rules. Existing research on rare association rule mining is based on the notion that the entire data to be operated on is available at the onset of the mining process. The medical databases in practice may get modified over time due to the addition of new records or deletion of previous records. Moreover, the user may switch to a new threshold for generating the desired set of rare association rules when the database gets updated. A straightforward yet incompetent solution for generating the current set of rare association rules would be to re-execute the entire mining algorithm from scratch, for each modified bunch of data and updated threshold. The algorithm proposed in this study is capable of generating the new set of rare association rules from updated medical databases in a single database scan without re-executing the entire mining process. It can efficiently handle the cases of transaction insertion and deletion and also provides flexibility to the user to generate the new set of rare association rules when threshold is updated. Experimental analysis illustrates the significance of proposed approach over traditional approach of repeatedly mining the entire updated database. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB As an important tool for information fusion, evidence theory has been widely applied in many areas. Unlike spatial evidence combination, temporal evidence combination is sequential and dynamic, which calls for new temporal evidence combination rule. In this paper, temporal evidence is combined based on relative reliability evaluation and evidence discounting. We first recall the method of evidence reliability evaluation based on intuitionistic fuzzy multiple criteria decision making (ERE-IFMCDM). Based on ERE-IFMCDM method, relative reliability factors of evidence sources in neighboring time nodes can be obtained. Then, according to evidence discounting and Dempster's combination rule, a method for temporal evidence combination based on the relative reliability factor is developed. Numerical examples and simulation demonstrate that the proposed method is time sensitive, which can reflect the dynamic feature of temporal information fusion. Moreover, the proposed method can deal with conflict in temporal fusion much better, which can enhance the anti-interference performance of the fusion system. The fusion framework proposed in this paper provides a dynamic perspective of the fusion of temporal uncertain information. It is helpful for the structural design of intelligent fusion system based on multiple temporal-spatial information. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Gene clustering is a prerequisite in the analysis of microarray data where sets of co-expressed genes are clustered. In this paper, a multi-objective clonal selection optimization algorithm (MCSOA) is developed based on the immune system behavior for gene clustering purposes in which the number of clusters can vary in a predefined range. To achieve a reliable clustering outcome on various gene expression (GE) datasets, the most effective clustering validity indexes are incorporated and represented in terms of two conflicting objective functions. For the sake of fast convergence to the optimal solutions, a new population updating mechanism is iteratively applied to select the less-dominate solutions of the previous iteration. The proposed clustering technique is implemented on various publicly available microarray datasets. Comparing the results with those of the widely used gene clustering techniques confirms the superiority and efficacy of the proposed technique. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, we address the Cumulative Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CCVRP), a variant of the classical CVRP, which aims to minimize the sum of the arrival times to customers instead of the total traveled distance. This problem is relevant due to its applications in fields such as emergency logistics, transportation, wireless network and computing, among others. This paper presents the first two tractable integer formulations capable of solving instances with up to 44 nodes and two versions of an Iterated Greedy procedure for dealing with larger instances. Experimental results show that both formulations obtain optimal solutions in a reasonable amount of computational time. Regarding the two metaheuristic procedures, they were able to reach optimal and best known solutions and, in some cases, outperform the bounds obtained by exact methods for tested instances with up to 199 customers. Using larger instances, the proposed metaheuristics showed competitive results when compared to the best known values reported in the literature, with a significant reduction in computational time.

AB Transforming unstructured text into a formal representation is an important goal of the Semantic Web in order to facilitate the integration and retrieval of information. The construction of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) pursues such an idea, where named entities (real world things) and their relations are extracted from text. In recent years, many approaches for the construction of KGs have been proposed by exploiting Discourse Analysis, Semantic Frames, or Machine Learning algorithms with existing Semantic Web data. Although such approaches are useful for processing taxonomies and connecting beliefs, they provide several linguistic descriptions, which lead to semantic data heterogeneity and thus, complicating data consumption. Moreover, Open Information Extraction (OpenIE) approaches have been slightly explored for the construction of KGs, which provide binary relations representing atomic units of information that could simplify the querying and representation of data. In this paper, we propose an approach to generate KGs using binary relations produced by an OpenIE approach. For such purpose, we present strategies for favoring the extraction and linking of named entities with KG individuals, and additionally, their association with grammatical units that lead to producing more coherent facts. We also provide decisions for selecting the extracted information elements for creating potentially useful RDF triples for the KG. Our results demonstrate that the integration of information extraction units with grammatical structures provides a better understanding of proposition-based representations provided by OpenIE for supporting the construction of KGs.

AB We propose an interactive decision-making framework to assist a Customer Service Representative (CSR) in the efficient and effective recognition of customer records in a database with many ambiguous entries. Our proposed framework consists of three integrated modules. The first module focuses on the detection and resolution of duplicate records to improve effectiveness and efficiency in customer recognition. The second module determines the level of ambiguity in recognizing an individual customer when there are multiple records with the same name. The third module recommends the series of feature-related questions that the CSR should ask the customer to enable rapid recognition, based on that level of ambiguity. In the first module, the F-Swoosh approach for duplicate detection is used, and in the second module a dynamic programming-based technique is used to determine the level of ambiguity within the customer database for a given name. In the third module, Levenshtein edit distance is used for feature selection in combination with weights based on the Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) of terms. The algorithm that requires the minimum number of questions to be put to the customer to achieve recognition is the algorithm that is chosen. We evaluate the proposed framework on a synthetic dataset and demonstrate how it assists the CSR to rapidly recognize the correct customer. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The concept of stability is one of the commonly used physical phenomena. Current paper builds on the hypothesis that the optimal number of clusters present in the dataset corresponds to that partitioning which is most stable over some small changes in the dataset. In order to quantify the degree of stability, a new measure is also proposed in the paper. Thereafter an expert clustering approach is developed in the current paper which utilizes the properties of stability for automatically detecting the number of clusters from a given dataset. Initially, several different variants of the dataset are generated by introducing small perturbations. A multi-objective based expert clustering framework is developed to automatically partition different variants of the data. A new objective function, capturing stability property of clustering solution namely 'Agreement-index', along with two well-known objective functions are optimized simultaneously using a multi-objective simulated annealing based process, namely AMOSA for the purpose of clustering. Finally, the problem of cancer classification is addressed as the application domain of the proposed expert framework. Results of our newly developed stability based clustering namely Stab-clustering with respect to existing approaches are shown for twelve microarray cancer datasets in terms of different cluster quality measures. The obtained results confirm the robustness of our proposed technique over state-of-the-art. A thorough biological and statistical significance tests are also conducted to prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In view of the rise in security and privacy concern in social networks, there has been an inadvertent increase in research related to framing of appropriate measures to detect the security breaches in social networks. Cyber criminals are misusing social networking platforms for inappropriate and illegitimate purposes such as posting or sending of illegitimate content which a genuine user will rarely do. Hence, whenever a sensitive and unusual text is posted by a user, there is a need to authenticate whether it is posted by the legitimate owner of the account or some imposter who might have compromised the legitimate profile. The process of authentication called authorship verification helps to handle the same. In this paper, authorship verification has been performed using different textual features such as n-grams, Bag of words (BOW), stylometric and folksonomy features to examine the authorship of tweets posted by the users on the microblogging platform Twitter. Appropriate classification and statistical analysis techniques have been applied to compute different performance parameters. From the experimental analysis, an important observation found is that though char n-grams have an upper hand to other features, still other applicable measures such as word n-grams, BOW, stylometric and folksonomy features cannot be overlooked as each user maintained consistency in different set of features. Accordingly, different feature selection techniques have been used to rank and select best feature for each user. From the comparative analysis of various similarity and statistical based feature selection techniques it is observed that AHP weighted TOPSIS method surpassed others in terms of different performance parameters. Further computation as per ranked features helped to improve the result by achieving an overall average F-score value of 93.82%. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Large-scale models are currently used for the simulation, analysis and control of real systems, whether technical, biological, social or economic. In multi-agent simulations of virtual economies, it is important to schedule a large number of agents across the cities involved, in order to establish a functional supply chain network for industrial production. This study describes an experimental evaluation of path planning approaches in the field of multi-agent modelling and simulation, applied to a large-scale setting. The experimental comparison is based on a model in which agents represent economic entities and can participate in mutual interactions. For the purposes of experiment, the model is scaled to various degrees of complexity in terms of the numbers of agents and transportation nodes. Various numbers of agents are used to explore the way in which the model's complexity influences the runtime of the path-planning task. The results indicate that there are significant differences between the runtime performances associated with single approaches, for differing levels of system complexity and model sizes. The study reveals that the appropriate sharing of shortest path information can significantly improve path-planning activities. Hence, this work extends current research in the field of path-planning for multi-agent simulations by conducting an experimental performance analysis of five distinct path-planning approaches and a statistical evaluation of the results. This statistical evaluation contrasts with performance analyses conducted on the basis of 'Big O' notation for algorithmic complexity, which describes the limiting behaviour of the algorithm and gives only a rough performance estimate.

AB This paper presents a novel indoor tracking system built with common data mining techniques on radio frequency identification (RFID) tags readings. The system allows tracking of several objects in real-time in a smart home context and is a building block toward the deployment of an expert system to enable aging in place through technology. The indoor localization is modelled as a classification problem, instead of a regression problem as commonly seen in the literature. The paper is divided in two parts. The first one focuses on the ground truth collection that led to the model construction. The second part focuses on the filters that were designed to enable this model to be used in real-time in the smart home as a tracking software. Results from the first part show that most classifiers perform well on the static positioning of RFID tags task, with a random forest of 100 trees performing best at 97% accuracy and 0.9740974 F-Measure. However, collecting data to train the classifier is a long and tedious process. Results from the second part indicate that the accuracy of the random forest drops significantly when confronted with human interference. With the help of some filters, the tracking accuracy of objects can still be as high as 75%. Those results confirm that using passive RFID tags for an indoor tracking system is viable. Our system is easy to deploy and more flexible than trilateration or fingerprinting systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB At present online marketplaces are flooded with numerous users having diversified choices across profusely present products. Recommender systems were developed to suggest items, friends or movies etc. to online users based on their profiles. Memory based Collaborative Filtering (CF) is one of the widely used approaches to build recommender systems. Despite quite successful, memory based CF approaches fail on scalability; which is the deteriorated performance of these approaches on the influx of new users/items into the system. This study presents Biclustering based Collaborative Filtering (BBCF)- an augmentation to existing recommender approaches and the comparison of the performance of the proposed approach on two datasets; Movielens100K and Jester, belonging to different domains and have different volumes, density, and user to item ratio. The results presented in this paper demonstrate the outperformance of BBCF systems compared to the state-of-the-art rating prediction approaches. One of the interesting findings based on the empirical results is that the performance of BBCF is better than the baseline approaches in terms of MAE, Recall, Item Coverage and Throughput. In addition, this study presents a comprehensive survey of biclustering approaches used in Collaborative Filtering systems, the impact of the number of biclusters and the overlapping degree on prediction and recommendation quality along with the limitations and some interesting research avenues in BBCF systems.

AB Forecasting a financial asset's price is important as one can lower the risk of investment decision- making with accurate forecasts. Recently, the deep neural network is popularly applied in this area of research; however, it is prone to overfitting owing to limited availability of data points for training. We propose a novel data augmentation approach for stock market index forecasting through our ModAugNet framework, which consists of two modules: an overfitting prevention LSTM module and a prediction LSTM module.
   The performance of the proposed model is evaluated using two different representative stock market data (S&P500 and Korea Composite Stock Price Index 200 (KOSPI200)). The results confirm the excellent forecasting accuracy of the proposed model. ModAugNet-c yields a lower test error than the comparative model (SingleNet) in which an overfitting prevention LSTM module is absent. The test mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and mean absolute error (MAE) for S&P500 decreased to 54.1%, 35.5%, and 32.7%, respectively, of the corresponding S&P500 forecasting errors of SingleNet, while the same for KOSPI200 decreased to 48%, 23.9%, and 32.7%, respectively, of the corresponding KOSPI200 forecasting errors of SingleNet. Furthermore, through the analyses of the trained ModAugNet-c, we found that test performance is entirely dependent on the prediction LSTM module.
   The contribution of this study is its applicability in various instances where it is challenging to artificially augment data, such as medical data analysis and financial time-series modeling. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The selection process is the most attractive operator in the optimization algorithms. It normally mimics the natural selection of survival of the fittest principle. When the selection is too greedy, the selection pressure will be high and therefore the search becomes biased toward exploitation. In contrast, when the selection has a tendency to be random, the selection pressure will be low and thus the exploration is observed more. The selection process in Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) tends to be too greedy since the search is driven by the three best solutions. In this paper, different selection methods extracted from other evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are investigated for GWO. Along with the original selection method of GWO called greedy-based selection method, five others selection methods which are proportional, tournament, universal sampling, linear rank, and random selection methods are investigated. Accordingly, six versions of GWO are proposed which are Greedy-based GWO (GGWO), Proportional-based GWO (PGWO), Tournament-based GWO (TGWO), Universal sampling-based GWO (UGWO), Linear rank based GWO (LGWO), Random-based GWO (RGWO). The six versions are evaluated using 23 test functions circulated in the literature with different characteristics and complexity. The sensitivity analysis of the control parameters of some new versions are discussed. Interestingly, TGWO achieved the best results for almost all benchmark functions. This proves that the selection methods have a high impact on the performance of GWO. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Feature selection is an important preprocessing task in classification that eliminates the irrelevant, redundant, and noisy features. improving the performance of model, decreasing the computational cost, and adjusting the "curse of dimensionality" are the key advantages of feature selection task. The evolution process of the existing multi-objective based feature selection algorithms is relied on the objective space while the problem space contains useful information. This paper proposes a multi-objective PSO based method named RFPSOFS that ranks the features based on their frequencies in the archive set. Then, these ranks are used to refine the archive set and guide the particles. The proposed method is compared with three PSO based and one genetic based multi-objective methods on 9 Benchmark datasets. Qualitative and quantitative analyses of the results are performed by visual analysis of the Pareto fronts and three performance metrics respectively. Finally, remarkable performance in datasets with more than hundred features and satisfactory performance in datasets with less than hundred features are obtained. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) has excellent performance in solving various optimization problems. However, it has been demonstrated that GSA tends to trap into local optima and are easy to lose diversity in the late evolution process. In this paper, a new hybrid algorithm based on self-adaptive Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) and Differential Evolution (DE) is proposed for solving single objective optimization, named SGSADE. Firstly, a self-adaptive mechanism based on GSA is proposed for improving the convergence speed and balancing exploration and exploitation. Secondly, the diversity of the population is maintained in the evolution process by using crossover and mutation operation from DE. Besides, to improve the performance of the algorithm, a new perturbation based on Levy flight theory is embedded to enhance exploitation capacity. The simulated results of SGSADE on 2017 CEC benchmark functions show that the SGSADE outperforms the state-of-the-art variant algorithms of the GSA. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Boosting algorithms have been proved effective for multi-label learning. As ensemble learning algorithms, boosting algorithms build classifiers by composing a set of weak hypotheses. The high computational cost of boosting algorithms in learning from large volumes of data such as text categorization datasets is a real challenge. Most boosting algorithms, such as AdaBoost.MH, iteratively examine all training features to generate the weak hypotheses, which increases the learning time. RFBoost was introduced to manage this problem based on a rank-and-filter strategy in which it first ranks the training features and then, in each learning iteration, filters and uses only a subset of the highest-ranked features to construct the weak hypotheses. This step ensures accelerated learning time for RFBoost compared to AdaBoost.MH, as the weak hypotheses produced in each iteration are reduced to a very small number. As feature ranking is the core idea of RFBoost, this paper presents and investigates seven feature ranking methods (information gain, chi-square, GSS-coefficient, mutual information, odds ratio, F1 score, and accuracy) in order to improve RFBoost's performance. Moreover, an accelerated version of RFBoost, called RFBoost1, is also introduced. Rather than filtering a subset of the highest-ranked features, FBoost1 selects only one feature, based on its weight, to build a new weak hypothesis. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets for multi-label text categorization) Reuters-21578, 20-Newsgroups, OHSUMED, and TMC2007(demonstrate that among the methods evaluated for feature ranking, mutual information yields the best performance for RFBoost. In addition, the results prove that RFBoost statistically outperforms both RFBoost1 and AdaBoost.MH on all datasets. Finally, RFBoost1 proved more efficient than AdaBoost.MH, making it a better alternative for addressing classification problems in real-life applications and expert systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Bayesian network has powerful expression and reasoning ability of uncertainty knowledge. At present, it is widely used in many fields, such as fault diagnosis, medical diagnosis and prediction, financial analysis and prediction, decision support, etc. How to construct the Bayesian network effectively is an important research problem in the area of data mining. The constraint-based learning algorithm is commonly used for the construction of Bayesian network (BNs), such as Fast Incremental Association (Fast-IAMB) and Max-Min Parents & Children (MMPC), etc. At present, the Chi square test and correlation coefficient are often used to calculate the correlation between variables in these algorithms. But the calculation accuracy of these methods is not high, thus to influence the effectiveness of the constraint-based BNs learning algorithms. On the basis of the entropy estimation approach of Gaussian kernel probability density estimator, this paper uses the (conditional) mutual information to calculate the correlation between different variables and thus to improve the learning accuracy of the constraint-based BNs learning algorithms. The concrete calculation process about the data type of discrete, continuous and mixed has been described separately. Experiment simulations on the Alarm network prove that our algorithm can improve the learning accuracy of the existing three kinds of constraint-based BNs learning algorithms without affecting the learning efficiency. It also has better learning effect when to process the concrete and continuous data with sparsity. The method in this work can be used to learn more accurate Bayesian network, and then served the research of artificial intelligence, expert system decision making, etc. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Chemical and electrochemical changes associated with controlled oxidation were measured in thirteen commercial white wines, in order to evaluate the potential of linear sweep voltammetry to provide relevant information on the oxidative behavior of individual wines. For a given amount of oxygen consumed, substantial diversity of oxidative behaviors was observed. A good correlation (R-2=0.69) was observed between the rate of O-2 consumption of individual wines and the total charged passed during linear sweep voltammetry, but not with their Folin-Ciocalteu values. Onset potential of anodic oxidation was also related to oxygen consumption capacity of wine, indicating an important contribution of easily oxidizable substrates. Subtraction of voltammograms of oxidized wines from their corresponding non-oxidized controls generated new voltammograms representative of the global changes induced by oxidation. These new voltammograms contained several features related to oxygen consumption rates of each wine, and could be considered as a 'wine oxidation signature'.

AB Here, a solid/liquid phase extraction mode was used for the preconcentration of Pb(II) in water and food samples through a biomass reinforced graphene oxide (BGO) membrane. Taking advantage of the two modes, the synergistic effect of BGO membrane (solid extraction) and organic solvent (liquid extraction) enhances the extraction efficiency toward target ion. In detail, the effect of composition parameters in BGO membrane and experiment conditions such as pH, eluent types, elution time and sample volume were optimized, as well as shows no obvious interference toward different competing ions. Under the optimal experiment conditions, the limit of detection, precision as RSD% of this method were found to be 0.84 mu g L-1 and 4.65%, respectively. Moreover, the large enrichment factor of BGO membrane demonstrates the applicability of the use of large sample volumes. Furthermore, the method was successfully verified by analyzing spiked Pb(II) in water and food samples.

AB A simple and fast one-step electrooxidative method has been developed to monolithically produce a copper phosphate (Cu-3(PO4)(2)) compound on a disposable copper tape, which can be integrated with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for the estimation of fish freshness. The Cu-3(PO4)(2) compound of flake-like nanostructures was formed by applying a first anodic peak potential at the copper tape for 10 min in a 1M sodium dihydrogen phosphate (NaH2PO4) (pH 5.0) solution. The Cu-3(PO4)(2) electrodes can detect the oxidative reaction of histidine and histamine in 20 mM NaH2PO4 solutions with pH 5.0-8.5. When integrating the electrodes with a flow injection system, the linear range and the calculated detection limit of histamine were respectively 2.5-250 ppm and 0.15 ppm. The electrodes integrated to HPLC can specifically detect the histamine concentrations in fish samples in the pH 7.5 NaH2PO4 solution, achieving an accuracy rate of 95.3% and a recovery rate of 101.1%.

AB Green tea is a highly consumed beverage, and the phytochemical composition, sensory qualities, and antioxidant activity of tea infusion are significantly affected by brewing conditions. However, the simultaneous effects of brewing conditions on the infusion are unknown. This study aimed to model the effects of brewing conditions (temperature, time, water/tea ratio and particle size) on the phytochemical composition, sensory profiles and antioxidant activity of green tea infusion using response surface methodology. The regression models describing the brewing of detected indexes were significant (p <= 0.01) and reliable (R-2 >= 0.854). Particle size had the greatest negative effects on the phytochemical composition and antioxidant activities of tea infusion. Optimization of brewing conditions performed for five types of needs and preferences for consuming were verified to be credible. In particular, optimal conditions of overall acceptance were 82 degrees C (temperature), 5.7 min (time), 70 mL/g (water/tea ratio), and 1100 mu m (particle size).

AB Dietary flavonoids as popular food additives have attracted a wide range of research interests. Naringenin, a common flavanone, was evaluated of its impact on the formation of advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) in bread crust. It was found that with the increase of naringenin content in bread (0.25-1% w/w), the formation of CML and total fluorescent AGEs were significantly inhibited (9.67-54.27% and 11.79-35.19%, respectively). In addition, the fortification with naringenin could also significantly inhibit the formation of acrylamide in bread crust, while enhancing the antioxidant and antibacterial activity of bread crumb without bringing undesirable changes to the bread quality attributes. Moreover, in RAW264.7 cells, naringenin significantly reduced of AGEs-induced ROS production as well as the contents of some inflammatory mediators. Altogether, our finding indicated naringenin can have dual inhibitory effects on both AGEs' formation in foods and AGEs-induced cellular oxidative stress and inflammation.

AB In this study, we investigated structural aspects of covalent binding of food derived blue pigment phycocyanobilin (PCB) to bovine beta-lactoglobulin (BLG), major whey protein, by spectroscopic, electrophoretic, mass spectrometry and computational methods. At physiological pH (7.2), we found that covalent pigment binding via free cysteine residue is slow (k(a)=0.065 min(-1)), of moderate affinity (K-a=4x10(4) M-1), and stereo-selective. Binding also occurs at a broad pH range and under simulated gastrointestinal conditions. Adduct formation rises with pH, and in concentrated urea (k(a)=0.101 min(-1)). The BLG-PCB adduct has slightly altered secondary and tertiary protein structure, and bound PCB has higher fluorescence and more stretched conformation than free chromophore. Combination of steered molecular dynamic for disulfide exchange, non-covalent and covalent docking, favours Cys119 residue in protein calyx as target for covalent BLG-PCB adduct formation. Our results suggest that this adduct can serve as delivery system of bioactive PCB.

AB A strain, Alternaria alternata SK37.001, which produces an intracellular alpha-L-rhamnosidase, was newly isolated from citrus orchard soil. The molecular mass of the enzyme was 66 kDa, as evaluated by SDS-PAGE and 135 kDa, as determined by gel filtration, which indicated that the enzyme is a dimer. The enzyme had a specific activity of 21.7 U mg(-1) after step-by-step purification. The optimal pH and temperature were 5.5 and 60 degrees C, respectively. The enzyme was relatively stable at a pH of 4.0-8.0 and a temperature between 30 and 50 degrees C compared with other pH levels and temperatures investigated. The enzyme activity was accelerated by Ba2+ and Al3+ but inhibited by Ni2+, Cu2+ and Co2+, especially Ni2+. The kinetic parameters of K-m and V-max were 4.84 mM and 53.1 mu mol mg(-1) min(-1), respectively. The a-L-rhamnosidase could hydrolyze quercitrin, naringin and neohesperidin, hesperidin and rutin rhamnose-containing glycosides but could not hydrolyze ginsenoside Rg2 or saikosaponin C.

AB Wax esters (WEs) and steryl esters (SEs) are minor components of sunflower oils formed by the esterification of long chain fatty alcohols and sterols to fatty acids. These compounds have similar carbon numbers and polarities making them difficult to separate using conventional chromatographic methods. In this study, electrospray ionisation-tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) allowed the rapid and accurate profiling of WEs and SEs acyl moieties in total ester fractions of common and mutant sunflower oils with different fatty acid profiles. The acyl composition of both WEs and SEs partially reflected that of the oil and the high oleic background displayed the lowest level of crystallisable waxes. ESI-MS/MS complemented by GC-MS analyses revealed that SEs contain 17-30% of previously unreported methylsterol moieties. We demonstrated that these compounds are overlooked by official sterol analytical methods which may have consequences for quality control and authentication of vegetable oils prior to commercialisation.

AB A molecular-level mechanism of alkali induced konjac glucomannan (KGM) hydrogel gelation processing is considered with the application of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy (AFM) as complementary methods to diffusive wave spectroscopy (DWS) microrheology and thermoanalysis. It is shown that deacetylation of KGM chains occurs immediately upon mixing with Na2CO3, inducing self-packaging. Partial unfolding of the packed loose structure of dehydrated KGM is observed upon heating. The configuration transition from random coils to self-assembling filament networks takes place before KGM aggregating to form large irreversible bundles with a lower degree of cross-linking. The gelation is not fulfilled until the temperature is increased to above 70 degrees C when the significant agglomeration is initiated among transitional fibrils to form junction zones essentially composed of acetyl-free portions. This suggests the intermolecular aggregation of KGM chains not simply regarding to hydrogen bonds, but essentially relating to hydrophobic interactions.

AB Five Brassicaceae sprouts (white cabbage, kale, broccoli, Chinese cabbage, arugula) were comparatively analyzed based on phytochemicals (polyphenols, glucosinolates, carotenoids, chlorophylls, ascorbic acid) content and accompanying enzymes associated with phytochemical stability and bioavailability (peroxidases, myrosinase, and polyphenol-oxidase) that consequently impact food quality. Significantly high content of polyphenols and glucosinolates, as well as a high antioxidant activity were found in white cabbage, followed by kale sprouts. In addition, white cabbage contained higher amount of fibers and lower polyphenol-oxidase activity which potentially indicates prevention of browning and consequently better sprout quality. Arugula and broccoli showed higher activity of myrosinase that may result in higher bioavailability of active glucosinolates forms. According to our data, sprouts are cheap, easy-and fast-growing source of phytochemicals but also they are characterized by different endogenous enzymes activity. Consequently, this parameter should also be taken into consideration in the studies related to the health benefits of the plant-based food.

The HPLC-TOF/MS analysis revealed the presence of 16 components including major components of morine, gentisic, 4-hydroxybenzoic, vanillic and fumaric acid. The antioxidant activities were evaluated with total antioxidant activity, reducing power, inhibition of lipid peroxidation, metal chelating, free radical and H2O2 scavenging activities. 5-HM, APEA and APBU exhibited the in vitro antioxidant activities in a concentration-dependent and moderate manner. The IC50 values were effective for free radical scavenging activity of 5-HM (8.22 mu g mL(-1)), H2O2 scavenging activity for APEA (8.12 mu g mL(-1)) and inhibition of lipid peroxidation for APEA (0.93 mu g mL(-1)). The 5-HM and APEA have antioxidant capacities and also feasible to apply variety in vivo tests.

AB Hazelnuts are a popular tree nut used whole or as an ingredient in a variety of bakery, candy and chocolate products. Based on the nutritional value and nutraceutical properties, mainly due to the lipid content, US Food and Drug Administration has recognized hazelnut as "heart-healthy" food. "Nocciola di Giffoni" is a Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) Italian hazelnut largely consumed but lacking of a comprehensive lipid profile. To acquire a detailed characterization of the polar lipids in fresh and roasted "Nocciola di Giffoni" hazelnut, an extensive analysis based on high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to multiple-stage linear ion-trap and orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-ESI/LTQOrbitrap/MS/MSn) was carried out. This analytical approach (statistically validated) allowed for the detection of a wide range of polar lipids from oxylipins and long chain bases to high molecular weight lipids (phospholipids, sphingolipids, and glycolipids). Most of the polar lipids are here described for the first time in hazelnut.

AB Butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) encapsulated in gelatin (GA) (GA-BHA) fiber mats were fabricated via electrospinning technique and applied to strawberry preservation. The volatile release kinetics and functional effectiveness of the mats were investigated. BHA was high efficiently encapsulated in GA fibers and the antioxidant activity of BHA could be well protected. The encapsulation of BHA enhanced the stability of GA and favored structure transition of GA from random coil and beta-turns to alpha-helix and beta-sheet. The GA-BHA mats showed good antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, and the predominant volatile release mechanism of BHA from mats was Fickian diffusion. Furthermore, the mats also showed broad-spectrum antifungal activity against four mould genera (Rhizopus sp., Mucor sp., Aspergillus sp. and Penicillium sp.). The shelf-life of strawberry can be prolonged effectively in the presence of GA-BHA mats during storage. Results suggested that the GA-BHA mats may have a great potential in active food packaging.

AB Lycium ruthenicum Murray (LR) is a functional food, and it has long been used in traditional folk medicine. However, detailed qualitative and quantitative analyses related to its phenolic compounds remains scarce. This work reports, for the first time, the establishment of a rapid method for simultaneous identification and quantification of 25 phenolic compounds by UPLC-quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-Orbitrap MS). This method was validated by LODs, LOQs, precision, repeatability, stability, mean recovery, recovery range and RSD. The confirmed method was applied to the analysis of phenolic compounds in LR. Finally, 18 phenolic compounds in LR were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed. Among them, 11 constituents were detected for the first time, which included two flavonoids (catechin and naringenin) and seven phenolic acids (gallic acid, vanillic acid, 2,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid, veratronic acid, benzoic acid, ellagic acid and salicylic acid). Moreover, Phloretin and protocatechuate, belonging to the dihydrochalcone flavonoid and protocatechuic acid respectively, were also identified and quantified. The total phenolics content (20.17 +/- 2.82 mg/g) and the total anthocyanin content (147.43 +/- 1.81 mg/g) were determined. In addition, the antioxidant activities of the LR extract were evaluated through 2,2-azinobis (3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) radical scavenging activity, ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and total antioxidant activity (T-AOC) assays.

AB This work describes, for the first time, an acryloyled beta-cyclodextrin hybrid monolith column was synthesized, under aqueous-phase conditions, and used for solid-phase microextraction of carbendazim and carbaryl. The monolithic column was characterized using scanning electron microscopy, nitrogen adsorption-desorption, thermogravimetric analysis and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and used as the adsorbent for solid phase microextraction (SPME) of carbendazim and carbaryl. After optimization of the SPME conditions, a simple and sensitive SPME-HPLC method was developed for the determination of carbendazim and carbaryl in leafy vegetables. The method exhibited a good liner response in the range 5-400 mu g/kg (R-2=0.9994) for carbendazim and 10-400 mu g/kg (R-2=0.9996) for carbaryl, respectively. The limits of detection were 1.0 and 1.5 mu g/kg for carbendazim and carbaryl, respectively, in leafy vegetables. Recoveries ranged from 92.6% to 110.1%, and the relative standard deviations were less than 6.1%.

AB The effects of humidity control on dried starch gels were investigated using starch noodles as a model. A two-stage innovative hot-air-drying regime was developed with the first stage humidity-controlled (70 degrees C, 60% RH) and the second at high temperature (100 degrees C). The proposed drying method is comparable to natural-air-drying in product quality and to conventional hot-air-drying (70 degrees C) in production efficiency. The operating humidity of the first stage predominated the swelling index and rehydration ratio of dry noodles as well as the hardness and chewiness of cooked noodles. The results from XRD, DSC, SEM, digital microscopy and low field TD H-1 NMR evidenced that these outcomes were largely ascribed to the higher shrinkage, lower porosity, smoother surface, lesser shape deformation and higher starch retrogradation resulting from increased humidity. The results reported herein are valuable for regulating the physicochemical properties of dried starch gels and glimpsing the underlying mechanisms of related operations.

AB To elucidate formation mechanism of oolong tea aroma, the released and remaining volatiles during bruising and withering treatment were analyzed using head space solid-phase microextraction/gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. An increase in proportion of the released terpenoid volatiles (TVs) along with a decrease in proportion of the released C-6 green leaf volatiles (GLVs) was observed in both cultivars 'Zhejiang139' and 'Foshou'. Proportion of remaining TVs also fluctuated reversely with GLVs although the level of these volatiles increased remarkably. High ratio of TVs to GLVs was the key chemical foundation of oolong tea characteristic aroma and could be regarded as a good indicator in screening cultivar for suitably producing high quality oolong tea. Combining with transcriptome analysis, increased TVs and GLVs during the treatment might be largely generated through de novo synthesis and modulated at transcript level through up-regulation of genes involved in terpenoids metabolism and enzymatic cleavage of long-chain fatty acids.

AB Selenium (Se) can delay the quality deterioration of rice during storage, however, the mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, changes in the quality of brown rice, germinated brown rice, and selenized germinated brown rice stored at 38 degrees C and 90% relative humidity with various vacuum levels for 120 or 150 days were investigated. Fatty acid value and carbonyl value were determined every 30 days. Comparative proteomics technology was applied to determine the mechanisms of germination and Se enrichment on the storage quality of rice. Approximately 142 abundance changed proteins were found, of which 37 proteins were identified. By functional classification, proteins involved in processes of carbohydrate metabolism, lipid metabolism, oxidation-reduction, and protein catabolism may contribute to the different storage qualities of three samples. This study provides novel insights into Se response in rice at the proteome level, which are expected to be beneficial for exploring Se response tracts in rice.

AB The combined effect of calcium chloride (CaCl2) (20-100 mM) and high pressure processing (HPP, 200 MPa) on the solubility of myofibrillar proteins (MP) was investigated under sodium-reduced conditions (0.3M sodium chloride). The results revealed that HPP combined with low concentrations (< 40 mM) of CaCl2 synergistically increased the solubility of MP, but an antagonistic effect occurred when a high concentration (100 mM) of CaCl2 was present. This synergistic effect could be attributed to a mildly destabilized conformation of myosin, an increased surface hydrophobicity and the decreased total sulfhydryl group content of MP. However, CaCl2 at 100mM destabilized myosin to a larger extent and induced non-disulfide covalent cross-linking of S-1 subfragment in pressurized MP, thus attenuating the solubilizing effect of HPP on the myosin heavy chain, resulting in the antagonistic effect. Therefore, HPP in combination with low-level CaCl2 (< 40 mM) may improve the functional properties of sodium-reduced meat products.

AB In this work, we present the development of a method for the determination of acetate and formate in vegetable oils by ion chromatography with conductometric detection following their extraction from samples using a diluted KOH solution. The extraction procedure was optimized using a multivariate approach. The application of a 24 full factorial design showed that the mass of sample, extraction time, and KOH concentration presented significant influence on the extraction of both acetate and formate, whereas the temperature presented little influence on the process. As a result, we set the extraction temperature at 22 degrees C and performed the multivariate optimization of the other variables using a Doehlert design. The optimum conditions were: 4.8 g of sample, 8 mmol L-1 KOH solution and 19 min extraction time. Six samples of vegetable oils (soybean, corn, canola, sunflower and olive) were analyzed and recovery tests provided recovery percentages in the range of 82-118%.

AB Potato processing generates large amounts of by-products, which include potato peels and the outer layers of flesh, which contain phenolic compounds. The purpose of this study was to establish an extraction method for phenolic compounds from industrial potato by-products by using response surface methodology (RSM). Box-Behnken design (BBD) was performed to optimize the extraction conditions of phenolic compounds considering different extraction temperature, ratios of ethanol/water, time of extraction and sample/solvent ratio. The optimum extraction conditions were obtained with ethanol/water 55/45 (v/v) by ultrasound bath during 35 min at 35 degrees C and 1/10 sample/solvent ratio. The best conditions were applied to determine the phenolic content in five potato by-products. The analyses by HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS showed that chlorogenic acid accounted for a 49.3-61% of the total phenolic compounds.
   Positive Pearson correlations between HPLC data and antioxidant activity confirmed that the phenolic compounds had significant antioxidant properties.

AB The total protein content and the (total and free) amino acid composition of nine edible species of red, brown and green seaweeds collected in the Portuguese North-Central coast were quantified to assess their potential contribution to the recommended dietary intake. Whenever possible, the protein and amino acid composition was compared with that of commercial European seaweeds. The protein content was the highest (P < 0.05) in red species (19.1-28.2 g/100 g dw), followed by the green seaweed Ulva spp. (20.5-23.3 g/100 g dw), with the lowest content found in brown seaweeds (6.90-19.5 g/100 g dw). Brown seaweeds presented the lowest mean contents of essential amino acids (EAAs) (41.0% protein) but significantly (P < 0.05) higher concentrations of non-essential amino acids (36.1% protein) and free amino acids (6.47-24.0% protein). Tryptophan, methionine and leucine were the limiting EAAs in all species. In contrast, lysine was found in high concentrations, especially in red (2.71-3.85% protein) and green (2.84-4.24% protein) seaweeds.

AB To date numerous metabolomic studies have been performed in order to characterize nutritional intervention studies. The aim of the current study was to present a comprehensive pipeline for characterizing the metabolic changes that occur in chickens tissues in response to naringin and hesperidin dietary supplementation. Forty-nine chickens were randomly divided into 3 groups: the first one fed with diet supplemented with naringin, the second with hesperidin whereas the control group was fed by commercial basal diet. After 30 days of administration chicken muscle samples were analyzed by UHPLC-HRMS whereas data were analyzed by the proposed pipeline. Three significant variables were detected to discriminate the control from the group after naringin administration and thirteen variables after hesperidin supplementation. Furthermore, a more detailed pipeline (encompassing multiple internal standards, internal validation of the clustering, extended statistical significance scores and multiple identification procedures) has been proposed aiming towards a more accurate untargeted analysis.

AB The aim of this work is the encapsulation of essential oils (EOs) in polymeric nanocapsules (NCs), in order to enhance their antimicrobial activity against food-borne pathogens. Thymus capitatus and Origanum vulgare EOs were selected for their different chemical composition, carvacrol (73%) and thymol (44%) being the major constituent, respectively. Polymeric poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) nanocapsules loaded with EOs were prepared by a nanoprecipitation method. The EO-NCs showed monomodal distribution with diameter size 171 and 175 nm, high efficiency of encapsulation and stability with high retention of EOs at both 4 degrees C and 40 degrees C, for a period of at least 30 days. The antimicrobial activity of EO-NCs against food-borne pathogens was higher than that of the corresponding pure essential oils and the NCs loaded with Thymus capitatus EO were the most active. Interestingly EO-NCs showed a bactericidal activity even at the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). It makes them appealing as natural food preservatives.

AB Flaxseed oil is a major source of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), as it contains nearly 50% of alpha-linolenic acid. For this reason it is highly susceptible to auto-oxidation. The aim of the work was to increase the stability of flaxseed oil by a microencapsulation process based on ionic gelation through vibrating-nozzle extrusion technology, using pectin as shell material. Two different drying systems, passive air drying (AD) and fluid bed (FB), were compared. The results show that the encapsulation efficiency is very high (up to 98%). Besides being approximately 20-fold faster, FB gives beads showing on average higher payload (76% vs 68%) and lower peroxide value (9.64 vs 21.33) than the AD. An accelerated test carried out on FB-dried beads shows that the oxidative stability of encapsulated oil is 13-fold higher than bulk oil (PV FB: 20 vs PV oil: 260), demonstrating the protecting effect of microencapsulation.

AB This study investigated the effects of pretreatments and optimized osmotic dehydration (OD) of lowbush blueberries using response surface methodology (RSM) to produce dehydrated blueberries with high antioxidants content and shelf life. Fresh wild blueberries (WB) were initially pretreated and then subjected to osmotic dehydration. Microwave pretreated WB had shown better water loss during osmotic dehydration as compared to other pretreatment methods investigated. The highest levels of phenolics, flavonoids, and anthocyanin content of the dehydrated WB were found to be 742.61 mg/100 g, 263.12 mg/100 g, and 428.11 mg/100 g d.m respectively, at optimized temperature of 40 degrees C, for 5 h OD, with 65% (w/w) Brix and 1:5 ratio of sample to Brix%. These results revealed that with rigorous optimization of the critical osmotic dehydration parameters high level of antioxidants could be obtained in the dehydrated product.

AB Proteomics was used to confirm allergen subunit differences between control and high hydrostatic pressure (HHP)-treated soy protein isolate (SPI), which could support further understanding of reduced allergenicity associated with HHP. SPI solutions (0.75% protein weight/solvent volume, pH 6.8) were subjected to HHP treatment at 200, 300, 400, 500 MPa for 5, 10, 15, 20 min, respectively. Enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay was used to assess the allergenicity, using soy-allergic human sera as the probe and non-soy-allergic human sera as the negative control. Proteomics was performed to analyze allergen differences in a mixed protein sample. HHP reduced allergenicity by 45.5% at 300 MPa for 15 min. Western blotting and mass spectrometry indicated that HHP treatment altered the allergenicity of < alpha > and < alpha > ' subunits of 7S globulin and A1 and A1a subunits of 11S globulin. This suggests HHP could improve the safe use of SPI in infant formula.

TI Cocoa and chocolate are sources of vitamin D-2

DT Article
DE Vitamin D; Ergocalciferol; Theobroma cacao L.; Cocoa; Cocoa butter;

AB Cocoa beans are susceptible to fungal contamination and often contain substantial amounts of ergosterol, the precursor to vitamin D-2. We hypothesized that sun-drying the fermented cocoa beans might lead to the conversion of ergosterol to vitamin D-2. We quantified vitamin D in cocoa and cocoa-based foods by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Here, we show that cocoa beans from different growing regions contain vitamin D-2. Particularly high vitamin D-2 content was found in cocoa powder and butter. Among the chocolates, dark chocolate had the highest vitamin D-2 content (ranging from 1.90 to 5.48 mu g/100 g), white chocolate had the lowest vitamin D-2 content (ranging from 0.19 to 1.91 mu g/100 g), and chocolate nut spreads had a comparatively low vitamin D-2 content, with an average of 0.15 mu g/100 g. Thus, cocoa and chocolate are clearly a dietary source of vitamin D, therefore, it is necessary to update food composition databases.

AB Spermine and spermidine are polyamines (PA) naturally present in all organisms, in which they have important physiological functions. However, an excess of PA has been associated with health risks. PA accumulates at quite high concentrations in some foods, but a quantitative assessment of the risk they pose has been lacking. In the present work, the cytotoxicity of spermine and spermidine was evaluated using an in vitro human intestinal cell model, and employing real-time cell analysis. Both spermine and spermidine showed a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect towards the cultured cells, with necrosis the mode of action of spermidine and perhaps also that of spermine. Spermine was more cytotoxic than spermidine, but for both PA the concentrations found to be toxic were above the maximum at which they have been found in food. The present results do not, therefore, support the idea that spermine or spermidine in food is harmful to healthy people.

AB The effects of casein micellar structure on the stability of milk protein-based conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) microcapsules were investigated. CLA emulsions were prepared with milk protein concentrates (MPC) or a mixture of whey protein isolates (WPI) and sodium caseinate (SC). Larger droplet sizes and wider size distributions were observed for MPC-CLA emulsions, where the varied sizes and heterogeneous protein particles with different rigidity discontinuously adsorbed on the oil droplets. Aggregated oil droplets with porous walls were found on the inner surface of MPC-CLA spray-dried powders. These microcapsules also had lower encapsulation efficiency and unfavorable oxidative stability. For MPC-CLA, 17% of the CLA remained after 45 days at 35 degrees C, while similar to 80% was retained for the WPI+SC-CLA microcapsules. The adverse effect of the casein micellar structure suggested that modification of casein micelles will be needed to improve the efficiency and chemical stability of such microcapsules.

AB Volatile compounds, including gamma-lactones, in brown and white rice fermented by Lactobacillus paracasei, were compared using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) with stir-bar sorptive extraction (SBSE). The contents of most esters, alcohols, lactones and some aldehydes were higher in brown rice samples containing higher amount of free fatty acids after fermentation. In particular, the contents of gamma-lactones increased more in fermented brown rice containing high amounts of fatty acids than in fermented white rice, suggesting that gamma-decalactone and gamma-nonalactone were formed from oleic acid and linoleic acid during rice fermentation. In addition, the contents of gamma-decalactone in fermented brown rice samples with added 4-hydroxydecanoic acid and ricinoleic acid were determined. The content of gamma-decalactone in fermented brown rice samples with added 4-hydroxydecanoic acid was considerably higher than that in the control after fermentation, indicating that 4-hydroxydecanoic acid could be an effective intermediate for the formation of gamma-decalactone in rice during fermentation.

AB Carob (Ceratonia Siliqua L., tree of the pea family Fabaceae) and its products have recently attracted great interest due to their polyphenolic composition. This review summarizes the polyphenolic compounds that are contained in different carob parts (leaves, pod, seeds, barks) and products (syrup, flour, fiber). It also states the main differences of polyphenolic composition due to environmental and natural reasons, such as region, variety, and gender, and due to the processes used for preparation, extraction and analysis. The gender, along with the extraction procedure, proved to be the most important factors affecting the polyphenolic composition. Supercritical fluid extraction is the most efficient technique used because it protects polyphenols from decomposition. Due to the relatively low number of publications, it is concluded that further development of optimum methods for extraction, analysis and isolation of polyphenols should be carried over to assess their antioxidant capacity and their food technological and pharmaceutical industry.

AB A simple, rapid and economic lateral flow immunochromatographic assay (LFICA) was designed for ultra-sensitive detection of beta-conglutin. Instead of antibodies and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) used in conventional LFICA, a cognate aptamer duo, binding to beta-conglutin and Fe3O4@Au core-shell nanoparticles, was applied in this study. An enzyme signal amplification strategy was used to enhance sensitivity. In addition, a new magnetic enrichment strategy was employed to further enhance sensitivity of the assay, slowing down movement of the capture probe (i.e., Fe3O4@Au nanostructures) using an external magnetic field. The novel LFICA assay can be completed within 20 min and achieved a detection limit of 8 fM, a thousand-times lower than similar assays without magnetic focusing. Overall, our results demonstrated the potential for the proposed LFICA sensor in rapid detection of beta-conglutin without any special analytical expertise or instrumentations.

AB Photosynthetic pigments, including carotenoids are important secondary metabolites, which play a key role in photosynthesis. There is little information about the effects of nitrogen and elicitor applications on chlorophyll and carotenoid concentrations in grapes. The aim of this work was therefore to study the effects of the foliar application of nitrogen sources and elicitors to Tempranillo, Garnacha and Graciano (Vitis vinifera L.) grapevines on chlorophyll and carotenoid contents. The results showed that beta-carotene and lutein were the most abundant carotenoids in all the samples, ranging from 1336 and 227 to 7054 and 1382 mu g/g, respectively. The applied treatments had greater impact on chlorophyll and carotenoid contents in Tempranillo grapes than in Graciano and Garnacha varieties. The content of chlorophyll was determined by the variety factor, while the concentration of carotenoids was influenced by the interaction of variety and treatment factors, depending on the type of foliar application.

AB The seaweed Cystoseira trinodis was fermented by different fungi prior to extraction of fucoidan and alginate to enhance their antioxidative potential. All the investigated fungi were able to produce fucoidanase (1.05-3.41 U/ml) and alginate lyase (7.27-18.59 U/mL). Different fungal species induced a reduction in the molecular weight (MW) of fucoidan and alginate in comparison to the unfermented control. The MW of fucoidan reduced by 41-81.5%, while the MW of alginate was reduced by 28-75%, depending on the fungal species. Significant increases in the fucose and sulphate contents of fucoidan and mannuronic/guluronic acid ratio of alginate were induced by fungal fermentation. Fungal pretreatment enhanced the ferric reducing antioxidant power, total antioxidant capacity and hydroxyl radical scavenging activity of both fucoidan and alginate. Additionally, enzymatic pretreatment of the macroalgal biomass assisted in the recovery of fucoidan and alginate with low molecular weight and enhanced antioxidative potential.

AB Glyoxal (GO) is one of the major toxic intermediates generated during lipid oxidation and degradation. We investigated the inhibitory activities and mechanisms of propyl, octyl, and dodecyl gallates (PG, OG, and DG) on the formation of GO in buffer and during thermo-processing of corn oil, and the anti-carbonyl and antioxidative activities of the mono-GO adducts of PG, OG, and DG. Our results suggested that alkyl gallates could more effectively trap GO than gallic acid. The major mono-GO adducts of PG, OG, and DG were purified and their structures were elucidated based on their H-1, C-13, 2D-NMR, and HRMS data. We further demonstrated that the mono-GO (MG) adducts retained the anti-carbonyl and antioxidative activities. This is the first study to demonstrate that alkyl gallates, the popular food additives, could prevent not only food oxidation, but also the formation of toxic reactive carbonyl species and their corresponding advanced glycation end products (AGEs) during food processing.

AB Ultrasound may convert conjugated isoflavones into their corresponding aglycones, the best form for absorption in the human body. However, ultrasound may also influence the activity of endogenous beta-glucosidase. Therefore, the present work evaluated the effects of soybean ultrasound pre-treatment by applying the Box-Behnken design prior to soaking, a step that is important for industries to prepare certain soy products. Furthermore, a multi-response optimisation is provided. The best conditions for soybean ultrasound pre-treatment were established as temperature, X-1=55 degrees C; exposure time, X-2=5 min and ultrasound intensity, X-3=19.5 W cm(-2). Under these conditions, soybeans with higher contents of aglycones were obtained and beta-glucosidase activity was kept as high as possible. A second experiment was conducted and confirmed that ultrasound pre-treatment results in a lower soaking time (2 h) to achieve the highest moisture content, lower hardness as well as increased content of aglycones.

AB Magnetic N-doped carbon nanotubes were firstly applied as adsorbent in food analysis for pre-concentration of bisphenols in fruit juices followed by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry determination. The magnetic nanoparticles were characterized by X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and vibrating sample magnetometer. The adsorption conditions were further optimized by response surface methodology. Under optimal conditions, the method provided good linearity with correlation coefficient (r=0.9979), excellent intermediate precisions (2.71-5.91%, n=3), low limits of detection (LODs) ranging from 0.43 to 2.47 ng L-1, and satisfying recoveries of three juice samples (between 90.6% and 101%).

AB Lycium ruthenicum Murr. is a traditional Chinese herb widely distributed in Tibet. The fruit, known as black goji, is popular in traditional Chinese medicine. The objective of this study was to investigate its anthocyanin profile (by HPLC coupled to PDA and MS detectors) and the colorimetric and spectrophotometric properties. Black goji extracts contained abundant petunidin derivatives, with cis and trans isomers of petunidin-3-p-coumaroyl-rutinoside-5-glucoside. The colorimetric and spectrophotometric traits of black goji anthocyanins were significantly impacted by solid-phase-extraction, pH, and acylation. MCX cartridge removed considerable polyphenolics from fruit extracts, but attenuated the saturation of color expression. Petunidin-3-trans-p-coumaroyl-rutinoside-5-glucoside contributed most of the color expression of the black goji extract, and showed superior stability compared to other extracts over time. Acylation strengthened the petunidin derivatives color retention, and enhanced the color intensity and stability. Black goji anthocyanins produced various vivid hues over wide ranges of pH, making them promising candidates for natural colorants.

AB Niboshi is a commonly used foodstuff that is processed from Japanese anchovy (Engraulis japonicus) in Japanese cuisine. It was previously demonstrated that Niboshi and its water extract contained highly bioavailable selenium for selenium deficient mice. In this study, we assessed the selenium bioavailability from the extract of the Niboshi, using cultured cells. The activity of selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase (GPx) of rat dorsal ganglion cells and human cervical carcinoma cells incubated with selenium from the Niboshi extract was over 2 times of that of the extract-free control cells and comparable to that of cells incubated with selenious acid of the same selenium concentration. These results suggest that selenium from the Niboshi extract was utilized for synthesis of the selenoprotein. Such in vitro selenium bioavailability was consistent with our previous results of in vivo assessment in mice.

AB A liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry quantitative method was developed for determining mebendazole and its metabolites, albendazole and its metabolites, and levamisole in muscles of bluntnose black bream, shrimp, eel and turtle based on modified QuEChERS methodology. The method included 2 g of the muscle matrix with 10 mL acetonitrile, and 0.8 g of magnesium sulphate and 0.2 g of sodium chloride for liquid-liquid partitioning. After vortex and centrifugation, the resulting liquid (5.5 mL) was purified by C-18 (50 mg) and Al-N (50 mg). The limits of detection were lower than 0.3 mu g kg(-1) and the limits of quantitation were no more than 1 mu g kg(-1) for all analytes. The recoveries of the analytes ranged from 80.0% to 113.7% with the relative standard derivation less than 10.0%. The preparation procedure provided efficient extraction and purification that enabled a sensitive and rugged determination of target compounds.

AB The current study aimed to identify and analyze the 100 most cited papers on the topic of nutraceuticals and functional foods. Scopus database was searched to extract bibliometric data. Two-thirds of the 100 most cited papers were reviews. Papers were mostly published in food science and nutrition journals, and one-third were published in seven journals, namely: British Journal of Nutrition (6), Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition (6), Journal of Food Science (5), Trends in Food Science and Technology (5), American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (4), Food Chemistry (4) and Journal of Nutrition (4). Topics with high citation counts dealt with prebiotics, probiotics, antioxidants and phenolic content. Hot topics with over 1000 citations per paper include bifido-bacterium (1147), colon (1032) and lipid metabolism (1013). The United States and Europe were major places of origin. These results can serve as a quick benchmarking reference for researchers or general public members.

AB This work aimed to investigate the effects of lipid oxidation on N-epsilon-carboxymethyllysine (CML) and N-epsilon-carboxyethyllysine (CEL) formation in three types of Chinese-style sausages during storage. Medium-high temperature dried sausage, naturally dehydrated sausage and smoke-dried sausage were prepared, and CML/CEL contents were measured. The result showed that CML and CEL levels increased with the increasing storage time, and an exponential correlation was found between thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARs) and either CML (r(2)=0.922) or CEL (r(2)=0.921) in medium-high temperature dried sausages and smoke-dried sausage, which suggested that lipid oxidation could facilitate CML/CEL formation during storage. Furthermore, lipid oxidation and the Maillard reaction might have a synergistic effect on CML formation in Chinese-style sausages, as evidence by the results of model system during incubation. These findings indicated that lipid oxidation played a key role in CML/CEL formation during the storage of Chinese-style sausages.

AB In this study, 11 dehydrodiferulic acids (DFAs) and 8 diethyl dehydrodiferulates (DEFs) were synthesized and evaluated by Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) and 2,2'-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assays for their antioxidant properties to understand the Structure-Antioxidant Activity Relationship (SAR) of these dehydrodiferulates. In both assays, the order of antioxidant activity for all tested ferulic acid dimers were consistent except for 3-(4-Hydroxy-3-methoxy-benzylidene)-5-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-phenyl)-3H-furan-2-one (2, 8-8-lactone DC DFA, not occurred naturally) being the best antioxidant by TEAC test. The order of antioxidant activity of diferulic acid ethyl esters, evaluated by both assays, was not consistent; however, TEAC and DPPH assays provided consistent results for certain set of ethyl diferulates. In this study most of dimeric ferulates, with three exceptions, showed higher radical-scavenging efficacy than the monomers. Comparing the antioxidant activities of the tested diferulates suggested that the phenolic hydroxyl group, electron donating methoxyl group, and stable conjugated transient structures dictate the antioxidant activity of diferulates.

AB The presence of carcinogens in food is a major food safety concern. A nanocomposite-based electrochemical DNA biosensor was constructed for potential carcinogen detection in food samples by immobilizing amine terminated single stranded DNA onto silica nanospheres deposited onto a screen-printed electrode modified using gold nanoparticles. The effect of three different DNA sequences: 15-base guanine, 24-base guanine and 24-base adenine-thymine rich DNA on carcinogen (formaldehyde and acrylamide) detection was evaluated. The competitive binding of the DNA with the carcinogen and electroactive indicator, Methylene blue (MB) was measured using differential pulse voltammetry. Optimization studies were conducted for MB concentration and accumulation time, DNA concentration, buffer concentration, pH and ionic strength. Overall, the 24-base guanine rich DNA yielded the best results with a detection limit of 0.0001 ppm, linear range between 0.0001 ppm and 0.1 ppm and reproducibility below 5% R.S.D. Finally, the results obtained using the biosensor were validated using Ames test.

AB To investigate the underlying mechanism of softening of ice-stored grass carp fillet, changes in assembly structure of myofibrillar proteins and potential candidates for regulating this change including myosin regulatory chain phosphorylation, heat shock proteins (Hsp27, Hsp90, alpha B-crystallin and UNC45) and endogenous protease activity were studied. Comparison of SDS-PAGE pattern of myofibrillar proteins treated with EDC crosslinking showed that thin filament experienced rapid disassembly within initial 8 h, followed by depolymerization of thick filament consisting of myosin, which further exacerbated the myofibril disorganization of fillets. Pearson coefficient analysis showed that UNC45, Hsp90, Hsp27 and alpha B-crystallin concentration and cathepsin B, D, L activities were significantly correlated with dissociated MHC and actin. Therefore, the significant correlation between shear force and dissociated MHC and actin clearly demonstrated that post mortem disassembly of myofibril filaments, which was regulated by endogenous proteolytic activity and loss of Hsp, contributed to the softening of ice-stored grass carp fillets.

AB The functional food value of herbal plants is greatly related to their contents of valuable phytochemicals. Regarding its impact on primary and secondary plant metabolism, CO2 enrichment could be a candidate strategy to modulate the levels of nutritionally and medicinally interesting phytochemicals in herbal plants. Herein, the concentrations of 81 metabolites and minerals were evaluated in shoot tissues of parsley and dill grown under two levels of CO2, ambient (378 +/- 25 mu mole CO2 mole(-1) air, aCO(2)) and elevated (627 +/- 24 mu mole CO2 mole(-1) air, eCO(2)). Regardless of the plant species, eCO(2) improved the levels of soluble sugars, starch, organic acids, some EAAs, most of USFA, total phenolics, total flavonoids and vitamins A and E. However, notable variations in the metabolites responsiveness to eCO(2) were recorded among the tested plant species. Moreover, considerable improvements in the total antioxidant capacity, antiprotozoal, antibacterial and anticancer activities were recorded for parsley and dill in response to eCO(2).

AB Pesticides are still a very important factor in food plant cultivation. The lipophilic character of most pesticides can lead to their accumulation in fat, which can have harmful effects on humans and animals. The aim of this review is to present current knowledge about the isolation and determination of pesticides in fatty commodities. The following techniques for isolation are discussed: solvent partitioning, solid phase and dispersive solid phase, QuEChERS-based procedures, matrix solid-phase dispersion, gel permeation chromatography, Soxhlet extraction, accelerated solvent extraction, and microextraction techniques. Chromatographic methods predominate in the analysis of pesticide residues in fatty matrices and, for this reason, the review focuses on these methods, particularly those combined with mass spectrometry. Analytical chemists still face the challenge - in the determination of pesticide residues in fatty matrices - of developing simpler and quicker procedures that consume less organic solvents.

AB A widely applicable method involving liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-ESI/MS/MS) was developed for the simultaneous determination of chloramphenicol, thiamphenicol, florfenicol, and florfenicol amine in eggs. Samples were extracted with ethyl acetate-acetonitrile-ammonium hydroxide (49: 49: 2, v/v) and defatted with hexane saturated with acetonitrile. The analysis was carried out on a mass spectrometer via an electrospray interface operated in the positive and negative ionization modes using deuterated chloramphenicol-d5 as the internal standard. The limits of detection and limits of quantification were 0.04-0.5 mu g/kg and 0.1-1.5 mu g/kg in eggs, respectively. The average recoveries of the four analytes from egg samples were 90.84-108.23%, with relative standard deviations of less than 9.61%. The corresponding intra-day and inter-day variations were found to be less than 8.11% and 11.30%, respectively. Finally, the new approach was successfully applied to the quantitative determination of these analytes in 50 commercial eggs from local supermarkets.

AB Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) is a modern technique that has been widely used for the detection of species used in meat products. For obtaining accurate and reliable qPCR results, we assessed two common DNA quantification methods for isolated DNA and five quantification approaches for qPCR products. DNA dilution based on spectrofluorometric results showed better qPCR results than those based on spectrophotometry in terms of linear correlation, amplification efficiency, and linear dynamic range. Binary pork-beef mixtures were used to construct standard curves of SYBR Green-based qPCR products using five quantification approaches, and they were validated and compared using in-house pork models. 18S rRNA gene normalization methods showed better trueness (-11.79% to -6.73%) than that of methods using absolute and relative standard curves (-28.52% to -18.64%) in a model burger. These normalized reference methods successfully estimated the quantities of pork meat in the range of 100%-0.01% in commercial beef products.

AB Plant growth regulators (PGRs) are commonly used to regulate maturation in strawberry. Despite this, comprehensive assessments of the metabolomic effects of PGRs on strawberry maturation are lacking. In this study, a nuclear magnetic resonance-based approach, combined with multivariate and pathway analysis, was used to evaluate the regulatory effects of gibberellin, forchlorfenuron, and brassinolide, applied at two different maturation stages, on the expression of metabolites in strawberry. The results demonstrated that the PGRs differentially influenced metabolism, whether applied at the same or different maturation stages. Additionally, we also discovered that these different PGRs exhibited some similar metabolic trends when applied at the same growth period. Our findings validate the use of NMR-based metabolomics for identifying subtle changes in the expression of metabolites associated with PGR application.

AB Carrot-orange juice processed by UV-C (10.6 kJ/m(2)) assisted with mild heat (H, 50 degrees C) and yerba mate addition (E) was obtained. UV-C/H+E treated juice was examined for native flora, polyphenol content (PC), total antioxidant activity (TAA), colour, turbidity, degrees Brix and pH along storage (4 degrees C). Consumer profiling studies were performed. UV-C/H+E provoked 2.6-5.7 native flora log reductions, preventing from recovery during 24 day-storage. The UV-C/H+E juice exhibited a significant increase in PC (720.2 mu g/mL) and TAA (5.5 mg/mL) compared to untreated (PC=205.0 mu g/mL/TAA=0.7 mg/mL) and single treated juices (PC=302.1-408.0 mu g/mL/TAA=0.7-2.4 mg/mL), remaining constant throughout storage. UV-C/H+E juice exhibited scarce changes in colour. Nevertheless, increases in degrees Brix and turbidity were observed compared to single treatments. A cluster sensory analysis revealed that one group showed a marked interest in UVC/H+E beverages with herbal taste and strong aroma. CATA question revealed that some improvements should be introduced in order to satisfy the consumers' ideally beverage.

AB In this study, emulsions were prepared through spontaneous emulsification, using three different citrus oils as the oil phase and Tween 80 as the surfactant. Utilizing 4% Tween 80, three types of citrus oil emulsions were prepared with small particle size, monomodal distribution and high transmission. After 24 h, each emulsion exhibited different degrees of gravitational separation. Mandarin oil emulsions were the most unstable, showing coalescence of small droplets with an obvious cream layer formed at 9 h. Bergamot oil emulsions possessed small droplets with the best stability over 24 h, due to their relatively polar components (e.g. linalyl acetate) and water-insoluble constituents (e.g. gamma-terpinene). These results suggest that the emulsifying properties and instability mechanism of citrus oil emulsions are strongly dependent on the inherent properties and composition of citrus oils. This study is significant for the development of an effective strategy to improve the stability of citrus oil-based colloidal systems.

AB The objective of this study was to identify metabolites that quantitatively indicate degrees of freshness of soybean sprouts. Self-cultivated soybean sprouts were stored at 5 degrees C, 10 degrees C or 20 degrees C, and respiratory CO2 production rates were monitored using gas chromatography during storage. Carbonyl compounds (CCs) were analyzed comprehensively using mass-spectroscopic metabolomics analyses. CCs were derivatized using dansyl hydrazine (DH) and were then analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) with multiplexed multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). In the MRM chromatogram, 171 to 358 peaks were observed from stored soybean sprouts. Principle component analysis and discriminant analysis (PCA-DA) selected the CC-DH derivative ion with a m/z 512 at a retention time of 9.34 min as the most significant metabolite. Searching online metabolomics databases and matching fragment patterns of product ion mass spectra of an authentic standard revealed abscisic acid is a freshness marker of soybean sprouts.

AB Cu could act as a modifier and influence lipid metabolism, but the potential mechanism was not explored. Juvenile yellow catfish were fed diet containing 0.71 (low Cu), 3.93 (intermediate Cu) and 88.81 (high Cu) mg Cu kg(-1), for 8 weeks to explore the modulation of intestinal lipid metabolism following dietary Cu addition. Using specific pathway inhibitors (Fatostatin for SREBP1, T0070907 for PPARG and Compound C for AMPK), primary enterocytes of yellow catfish were used to explore the molecular mechanisms of Cu reducing intestinal lipid deposition. Dietary Cu addition triggered Cu accumulation but suppressed lipid deposition in the fore-and mid-intestine. The reduced lipid deposition was attributable to the suppressed lipogenesis and lipid absorption, and accelerated lipid transport. The PPARG, SREBP1 and AMPK signaling pathways mediated the Cu-induced changes in lipogenesis, lipid uptake and lipid transport in the intestine of yellow catfish.

AB Artemide is one of the Italian pigmented rice varieties richest in polyphenols, especially anthocyanins. The aim of this work was to obtain anthocyanin-rich powders from Artemide cv, useful as functional ingredients for bakery foods.
   The hydroalcoholic extract prepared from Artemide black rice was processed by both spray-drying (with and without coating agents: maltodextrins: MD; arabic gum: GA) and freeze drying, in order to obtain ingredients more stable during storage and baking.
   The polyphenols spray-dried with MD and GA (50: 50, w/w) resulted the ingredient most stable to the storage and partially protected from thermal damage during the baking in a model biscuit. The enriched biscuits showed a significantly higher content of polyphenols, antioxidant capacity and anthocyanins respect to a control biscuit.
   The polyphenolic extract obtained from Artemide black rice can be considered a valuable source of polyphenols to produce functional foods or microencapsulated ingredients for nutraceutical applications.

AB Acid proteases from sabalo stomach mucosa were recovered using salting-out procedure. This single step produced an enzyme extract purified 1.8-fold over the crude extract with a recovery of 45.1% of its initial proteolytic activity. Sabalo proteases exhibited the highest activity at 45 degrees C-pH 2.0, showed pH stability between 2.0 and 5.0 and retained more than 70% of its activity after incubation at pH 7.0 for 2 h. Fish extract was unstable at temperatures greater than 45 degrees C. Its activity was inhibited by pepstatin A but not by PMSF, while EDTA and SDS showed partial inhibitory effects. Presence of CaCl2 and MgCl2 increased the proteolytic activity, while increasing concentrations of NaCl strongly decreased it. In addition, compared to the acid extraction method, the use of sabalo enzymatic extract increased 1.7 times the yield of collagen extraction.

AB Blackberry fruit contains high levels of polyphenols particularly anthocyanins which contribute to its biological activities. Bioavailability of polyphenols especially anthocyanins is generally low, it has been proposed that metabolites from polyphenol biotransformation under colonic fermentation are components that exert health benefits. In this study, blackberry was subjected to simulated gastrointestinal digestion and gut microbiota fermentation at different time intervals (0-48 h) to study the changes in bioactive components, its antioxidant and antidiabetic activities. Phenolic compounds, during digestion and fermentation were also analysed. Gut metabolites of blackberry significantly increased the glucose consumption and glycogen content in HepG2 cells. Furthermore, gut metabolites ameliorated high glucose plus palmitic acid-induced ROS overproduction, mitochondrial membrane collapse, and glutathione depletion in HepG2 cells. The mechanism of antidiabetic activity of blackberry was via its potent antioxidant activity. Therefore, our results suggest that blackberry could be recommended as a functional food due to potential antioxidant and antidiabetic activity.

AB Compared to P. longanae-inoculated longan fruit, DNP-treated P. longanae-inoculated longans displayed higher fruit disease index, pericarp browning index and cell membrane permeability. Moreover, they exhibited higher activities of phospholipase D, lipase and lipoxygenase, lower amounts of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol and USFA (unsaturated fatty acids) as well as higher amounts of phosphatidic acid and SFA (saturated fatty acids). Additionally, lower ratio of USFA to SFA and USFA index were shown in DNP-treated P. longanae-inoculated longans. However, ATP-treated P. longanae-inoculated longans exhibited the opposite results. These findings indicated that DNP stimulated longan pericarp browning and disease development caused by P. long-anae resulted from the increases in activities of membrane lipids-degrading enzymes, promoting degradation of membrane phospholipids and USFA, and disruption of membrane structural integrity. Whereas, the opposite results observed in ATP-treated P. longanae-inoculated longans were due to the reduction in activities of membrane lipids-degrading enzymes and the maintenance of membrane structural integrity.

AB Mango allergy is a rare condition, which may cause severe hypersensitivity reactions, such as anaphylaxis, angioedema, asthma and contact dermatitis. By exploiting the combinatorial peptide ligand library (CPLL) technology, mango proteomes have been extracted and the presence of traces of allergens assessed via Western blot analysis two-dimensional maps. Upon reactive spot elution and mass spectrometry analyses, four major mango allergens could be identified for the first time and shown to be in common with three of the five known banana species. These allergens include: Mus a 1, Mus a 2 and Mus a 5. Additional mango allergens detected do not seem to be in common with the banana species. In particular, a pectinesterase and a superoxide dismutase, both widely described as allergens, could be identified in mango extracts. Conversely, plain mango extracts not treated with CPLLs did not exhibit any reactive spots in Western blot analysis.

AB Chronic diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) is a major cause of disability and mortality in patients with diabetes. Dysfunctional endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) play important roles in preventing vascular complications in these patients. Our results determined the elevated expression of histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) both in patients with DFU and in high glucose (HG) induced EPCs. In this study, HDAC2 siRNA (si-HDAC2) was transfected to investigate the effects of HDAC2 on EPCs. Cell proliferation decreased in HG-induced EPCs, but it was upregulated after si-HDAC2 transfection. Tube formation of EPCs also decreased with HG, which was reversed by si-HDAC2 transfection. Furthermore, inflammatory factors and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in EPCs were detected, showing that HG increased TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, and ROS production in EPCs. However, si-HDAC2 reversed these effects. These results indicate that HDAC2 inhibitor may resist HG-induced EPC injury. Finally, reduced expression of HO-1-Sirt1 signaling in HG-induced EPCs also was reversed by HDAC2 siRNA. In conclusion, these findings indicate that HDAC2 inhibitor may prevent impaired cell proliferation, tube formation, inflammation, and ROS production in high-glucose EPCs.

AB Apoptosis is an important contributing factor in spinal cord injury (SCI). ZBTB38 is involved in the transcriptional regulation of multiple signaling pathways, is differentially expressed at different SCI stages, and may provide a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of patients with SCI. In this study, we found that autophagy is blocked in ZBTB38 knockdown SH-SY5Y cells and that the expression levels of LC3B II/I decreased and P62 increased. We used transcriptome high-throughput sequencing to identify the target in ZBTB38 knockdown cells. From the transcriptome profile, RB1CC1 (i.e., FIP200), a key component of the initiation machinery of autophagy (FIP200-ATG13-ULK1-ATG101), was found to decrease 4.2-fold following ZBTB38 knockdown. When RB1CC1-overexpressed plasmids were transfected into ZBTB38 knockdown cells, they rescued the phenotype of ZBTB38 knockdown cells. Cell proliferation and viability were significantly enhanced by RB1CC1 over expression, and LC3B and P62 expression returned to their original levels. We also injected ZBTB38-overexpressed lentivirus into the injured center of the spinal cord and detected significant upregulation of RB1CC1 in the spinal cord. ZBTB38 overexpression can promote autophagy and partly rescue the secondary damage of SCI. Therefore, our findings provide a new strategy for the treatment of SCI.

ID ABUNDANT
AB Ascosphaera apis is a widespread fungal pathogen of honeybee larvae, which causes heavy losses in apiculture. To date, knowledge about non-coding RNA (ncRNA) including circular RNA (circRNA) in A. apis is lacking. In this study, A. apis mycelia and spores were sequenced using RNA-seq technology. A total of 551 circRNAs were predicted on the basis of bioinformatic analyses, and most of the circRNAs were 200-600 bp in length, which were different from animal and plant circRNAs. In addition, the expression of six circRNAs in A. apis were confirmed using divergent and convergent PCR. Moreover, circRNA-microRNA regulation networks in A. apis were constructed, and further investigation showed that A. apis circRNAs could regulate gene expression by competitively binding miRNAs. GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses of the miRNAs target genes of circRNAs demonstrated that these A. apis circRNAs are likely to play key roles in metabolism, environmental response and gene expression.

AB OsWTG1 (LOC_Os08g42540.1) functions as an important factor determining grain size and shape in rice. Our understanding on its ortholog in wheat, TaWTG1, is limited. Here, we identified and mapped TaWTG1 in wheat, characterized its gene and protein structures, predicted transcription factor binding sites of its promoter, and the expression patterns was also analysed bases on real-time quantitative PCR and public available microarray data. The WTG1 orthologs in barley (HvWTG1), rice (OsWTG1), Aegilops tauschii (AtWTG1), Triticum urartu (TuWTG1), Triticum turgidum (TtWTG1) and Brachypodium distachyon (BdWTG1) were also identified for comparative analyses. TaWTG1 was mapped onto the short arms of group 7 chromosomes (7AS, 7BS, and 7DS). Multiple alignments indicated that WTG1 possesses eight exons and seven introns in all of the orthologs, except for the orthologs on 7A of wild emmer and on 7D of A. tauschii (seven exons and six introns). An exon-intron junction composed of intron 2 to intron 3 and exon 2 to exon 4 was highly conserved. The protein of WTG1 exists a conserved domain (Peptidase_C65). WTG1 was mainly expressed in wheat roots, spikes and grains, in barley caryopsis and roots, and in rice anthers. Drought and heat stresses significantly regulated the expression of TaWTG1 in wheat. In barley, WTG1 was significantly down-regulated under Fusarium at late stage. In addition, significant correlations between the expression patterns of predicted transcription factors and WTG1 were also detected. Overall, the results presented here broaden our knowledge on WTG1 and will be helpful for its manipulation aiming at dissecting its function in plants.

ID MUCOPOLYSACCHARIDOSIS TYPE-I; MUTATIONS; IDENTIFICATION; DISEASE
AB Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is a lysosomal storage disorder (LSD). It is caused by mutations in the IDUA gene, which lead to the accumulation of the glycosaminoglycans dermatan and heparan sulfate. The CRISPR-Cas9 system is a new and powerful tool that allows gene editing at precise points of the genome, resulting in gene correction through the introduction and genomic integration of a wildtype sequence. In this study, we used the CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing technology to correct in vitro the most common mutation causing MPS I. Human fibroblasts homozygous for p.Trp402* (legacy name W402X) were transfected and analyzed for up to one month after treatment. IDUA activity was significantly increased, lysosomal mass was decreased, and next generation sequencing confirmed that a percentage of cells carried the wildtype sequence. As a proof of concept, this study demonstrates that CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing may be used to correct causative mutations in MPS I.

AB The WRKY transcription factors, a large family of proteins in plants, are involved in multiple developmental and biological processes including response to phytohormones and abiotic stress. However, little information is available regarding the WRKY family in Eucalyptus, which has been the most widely planted hardwood trees in tropical and subtropical areas. In this study, a total of 79 WRKY genes (named as EgrWRKY1-79) were identified from the Eucalyptus grandis genome and classified into three main groups according to the phylogenetic analysis, which was further supported by their gene structure and conserved motifs. Of which, 28 EgrWRKYs were involved in tandem duplication but none for segmental duplication, indicating that tandem duplication was the main cause for the expansion of WRKY gene family in E. grandis. Subsequently, expression profiles of EgrWRKY genes in eight different tissues and in response to treatments of three hormones (SA, JA, and BR) and two abiotic stresses (salt and cold) were analyzed. The results revealed that the EgrWRKY genes had differential expression in their transcript abundance and they were differentially expressed in response to plant hormones and salt and cold stresses, suggesting their contributions to plant developmental processes as well as abiotic stresses with the involvement of hormone signaling transduction. Taken together, these findings will increase our understanding of EgrWRKY gene family involved in abiotic stresses and hormone signaling transduction, and also will provide some stress-responsive candidate EgrWRKY genes for further characterization of their functions in Eucalyptus.

AB Background and purpose: Genome-wide association studies discovered a novel correlation between chromosome 12q24 and ischemic stroke in European populations. This study aimed to determine whether two genetic variants (rs10744777 and rs886205) on chromosome 12q24 can modify the risk of ischemic stroke in Chinese population.
   Methods: We recruited 1195 patients with ischemic stroke and 642 healthy Chinese individuals. The rs10744777 and rs886205 polymorphisms in aldehyde dehydrogenase2 (ALDH2) was genotyped and compared using multivariate logistic regression.
   Results: The genotype of rs10744777 (CT/TT) was associated with risk of ischemic stroke in males (OR = 1.99, 95% CI = 1.15-3.42, P = 0.013). In contrast, no significant correlation was found in females. Haplotype analysis indicated that haplotype "TA" was associated with increased ischemic stroke risk (OR = 1.85, 95% CI = 1.10-3.12, P = 0.042). Further subtype analysis demonstrated that the rs10744777 (CT/TT) genotype was strongly associated with large artery atherosclerosis subtype in males (OR = 2.27, 95% CI = 1.30-3.95, P = 0.004). After three months follow-up, we found a poorer functional outcome of ischemic stroke associated with the rs886205 GA genotype (OR = 1.76, 95% CI 1.03-3.00, P = 0.057) in males.
   Conclusions: Genetic polymorphisms in ALDH2 modified ischemic stroke risk and outcome in Chinese males, but not in females.

AB Taste receptors (TRs) are seven trans-membrane G protein-coupled receptors as well as the interface between internal and external milieus, which playing pivotal roles in nutrient identification and acquisition. To better understand the scope and function of tr gene family in common carp, one of the most economic and important breeding fish species, which has undergone an additional round of whole genome duplication (WGD), we characterized 13 tr gene homologues including eight type I and five type II taste receptor genes from common carp genome, which were more than any other teleosts. Phylogenetic and syntenic analysis revealed the evolution dynamics of tr gene family, which was highly conserved, though gene duplication and gene loss do exist recently. Furthermore, the motif and dN/dS analyses indicated that these receptors were under different negative selection pressure. Additionally, the gene expression divergences were observed in 12 health tissues of common carp, with a relatively high level in barbel and head kidney, demonstrating tissue-specific expression of tr genes in the tetraploidized genome. The overarching goals of this study were to identify the abundance of tr genes in common carp, compare the gene divergence among species with varied feeding habits and provide genomic resources for future studies on teleost taste sensation.

AB Melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) plays critical roles in the regulation of various physiological processes, such as energy homeostasis, reproduction and sexual function, cardiovascular function, and other functions in mammals. Although the functions of the MC4R in fish have not been extensively studied, the importance of MC4R in regulation of piscine energy expenditure and sexual functions is emerging. Swamp eel (Monopterus albus) is an economically and evolutionarily important fish widely distributed in tropics and subtropics. We cloned swamp eel mc4r (mamc4r), consisting of a 981 bp open reading frame encoding a protein of 326 amino acids. The sequence of maMC4R was homologous to those of several teleost MC4Rs. Phylogenetic and chromosomal synteny analyses showed that maMC4R was closely related to piscine MC4Rs. qRT-PCR revealed that mc4r transcripts were highly expressed in brain and gonads of swamp eel. The maMC4R was further demonstrated to be a functional receptor by pharmacological studies. Four agonists, alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH), beta-MSH, [NIe(4), D-Phe(7)]-alpha-MSH (NDP-MSH), and adrenocorticotropin, could bind to maMC4R and induce intracellular cAMP production dose-dependently. Small molecule agonist THIQ allosterically bound to maMC4R and exerted its effect. Similar to other fish MC4Rs, maMC4R also exhibited significantly increased basal activity compared with that of human MC4R. The high basal activity of maMC4R could be decreased by inverse agonist ML00253764, suggesting that maMC4R was indeed constitutively active. The availability of maMC4R and its pharmacological characteristics will facilitate the investigation of its function in regulating diverse physiological processes in swamp eel.

AB Human KIF4 is a member of Kinesin-4 kinesin family. The highly conserved structure contains an N-terminal motor region, coiled-coil region and C-terminal loading region. KIF4 plays important roles in DNA repair and DNA replication, which maintains genetic stability. KIF4 is also essential for regulation of mitosis and meiosis. KIF4 cooperates with condensin I and TopoII alpha to help with chromosomal condensation, and binds to a plethora of cell-cycle proteins to regulate spindle organization and cytokinesis. Additionally, KIF4 plays roles in germ plasm aggregation and radial order in germ cells. In neuronal cells, KIF4 promotes proper axon growth by transporting substrates PO and L1 to their proper location. Interestingly, KIF4 is abnormally expressed in a variety of cancers, where KIF4 is often up-regulated but can also be down-regulated in some cancers. This suggests distinctive regulatory mechanisms for different cancers. Recent studies support important roles for KIF4 in cancers such as the promotion of drug resistance or inhibition of apoptosis. Previous studies showed that by inhibiting or enhancing the expression of KIF4, the proliferation of cancer cells can be significantly reduced. Therefore KIF4 has potential as a therapeutic target for cancer therapy. Moreover, the misregulation of KIF4 is related to viral infection and neural system diseases like Alzheimer. We believe better understanding of this protein will help us develop better therapies for the diseases mentioned above. Here, we summarize KIF4 functions in normal cells and in various cancers, and provide an overview on the association between KIF4 disorders and disease progression.

AB Aided by a host of bioinformatics tools, primary and secondary structural analyses of the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) from the eukaryotic ribosomal RNA repeat have a long and enviable record of service to diversity studies of fungi, plants and protists. Automation of annotation, secondary structure estimation and sequence alignment have become routine for the vast majority of ITS2 sequences. Challenges to the bioinformatics pipeline for ITS2 analysis generally arise in cases where the sequence length lies well outside the norm. These sequences generally defy protocols for annotation and secondary structure prediction. The long ITS2 sequences (ca. 600 nucleotides) from the green alga, Jenufa, offered an opportunity to explore this problem. Custom BLAST parameters revealed the presence of 4-helix structures (200-250 nucleotides) embedded in the 5' portion of several long ITS2 sequences of Jenufa. Of special note is the ITS2 sequence of J. lobulosa where a 4-helix structure was obtained for both the embedded ITS2 and for the complete sequence. Phylogenetic analysis of these typically-sized sequences resolved Golenkinia longispicula as the sister to Jenufa. Our observations indicate that other long ITS2 sequences should be examined for evidence of expansion or duplication. In addition, if the embedded ITS2 sequences are functional, then ribogenesis is almost certainly more diverse than is already apparent from studies of humans and yeast.

AB Background: Genetic alterations and epigenetic modifications are two main factors involved in gastric carcinogenesis, progression, and metastasis. Several miRNAs such as miRNA-9 and miRNA-326 may play important role in gastric cancer by targeting the 3'UTR of the caudal type homeobox (CDX) 1 and 2 mRNA respectively. The use of herbal medicines has been widely considered in the treatment of cancers such as gastric cancer. Sulforaphane extracted from broccoli may indirectly prevent cancer through affecting different signaling pathways. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of different concentrations of sulforaphane extracted from broccoli sprout (SEBS) on viability, death pattern, and expression alterations of CDX1/2 as well as miRNA-9 and miRNA-326 in normal (HF2FF) and gastric cancer cell lines.
   Methods: Two gastric cancer cell lines (AGS and MKN45) and HF2FF normal cell line were cultured and treated with different concentrations (31.25, 62.5, 125, and 250 mu g/ml) of the purified sulforaphane. Expression levels of CDX1 and CDX2 as well as miRNA-9 and miRNA-326, and mechanisms leading to cell death were assessed by Taqman real time PCR assay and flow cytometry, respectively.
   Results: Significant dose-dependent and anti-proliferative effects of the SEBS were observed on AGS and MKN45 cells after 48 h with an IC50 value of about 112 and 125 mu g/ml, respectively (P < 0.001). Apoptotic cells were observed in AGS and MKN45 cells but not HF2FF after 48 h of treatment with SEES. Furthermore, significant changes in expression of CDX1, CDX2, miR-9 and miR-326 in the gastric cancer lines (AGS and MKN45), were observed under different concentrations of SEBS.
   Conclusion: Our present study suggests that the SEBS may influence gastric cancer cell lines at specific doses and change their proliferation rate by altering the expression of CDX1, CDX2, miR-9, and miR-326.

AB Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been demonstrated to be involved in the development and progression of multiple cancers by previous studies. Recently, a novel lncRNA, THOR (testis-associated highly conserved oncogenic long non-coding RNA), was characterized in human cancers and shown to exhibit an oncogenic role. However, the role of THOR in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is still unclear. In this study, we found that THOR was relatively highly expressed in human HCC tissues and cell lines. Notably, high THOR expression was associated with worse prognosis. THOR depletion resulted in significant inhibition of the growth and metastasis of HCC cells. Mechanistically, THOR drives HCC cell progression via the PTEN/AKT pathway. Moreover, the specific PI3-K inhibitor LY294002 abolished the discrepancy in the growth and metastatic capacity between THOR-silenced HCC cells and control cells, which further confirmed that AKT was required in THOR-driven HCC cell growth and metastasis. Taken together, our results suggest that THOR could promote HCC cell growth and metastasis by amplifying PTEN/AKT signaling and may be a new therapeutic target and predictive factor for HCC.

AB Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer, and adjuvant targeted therapy has shown great benefits for the NSCLC patients with specific genomic mutations. Alectinib, a selective anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitor, has been clinically used for the NSCLC patients with ALK-rearrangement, however, irreversible therapeutic resistance for the patients receiving alectinib treatment frequently occurs. Here we show that neuromedin U (NMU) may confer the alectinib resistance in NSCLC via multiple mechanisms based on the integrative bioinformatics analyses. Through employing the bioinformatics analyses of three microarray datasets, NMU, overexpressed in both NSCLC tissues and alectinib-resistant NSCLC cells, was initially identified as potential candidate for causing alectinib resistance in NSCLC. The resistance function of NMU in NSCLC was validated by performing protein/gene interactions and biological process annotation analyses, and further validated by analyzing the transcription factors targeting NMU mRNA. Collectively, these results indicated that NMU may confer alectinib resistance in NSCLC.

AB FK506-protein also called FKBP protein belongs to PPIase (peptidylprolylcis-trans isomerase) super family of immune suppressive drugs that act as molecular protein chaperones. In plants, FKBPs are ubiquitous and involved in various biological and physiological processes like plant germination, development, stress response and hormonal signaling. Here, we identified 24 FKBP family genes in tomato by using different tools and bioinformatic approaches. The specific structure, domain organisation, cis-regulatory elements, phylogenetic analysis, multiple sequence alignment, tissue-specific expression patterns and expression under abiotic and phytohormone stresses of all genes were investigated. The genes are clustered on ten tomato chromosomes and are categorised into two sub-classes; single and multiple domains protein gene. One of the main features of tomato FKBPs is their large fractions localized in chloroplast (in silico analysis) and clustered together phylogenetically. Tissue-specific expression analysis using available RNA-seq data revealed the spatiotemporal expression of the FKBPs, but few genes were observed with relatively high expressions in certain developmental stages. However, the quantitative expression profile of all genes under hormone stress provided a supporting evidence for their potential role in hormone signal pathways. Our prediction not only providing the foundation for better understanding the complex physiological regulation of FKBP gene family in tomato but also providing the potential aids to accelerate tolerance and survival in tomato under stressful condition.

AB Tripterygium glycosides (TGs) are chemotherapeutic drugs and immunosuppressant agents for the treatment of cancer and autoimmune diseases. We have previously reported that TGs induces premature ovarian failure (POP) by inducing cytotoxicity in ovarian granulosa cells (OGCs). Hence, we report that TGs suppress the expression of the Hippo-YAP/TAZ pathway in murine OGCs in vitro and in vivo. We found that the expressions of miR-181b, miR-15a, and miR-30d, were elevated significantly in the POF. Luciferase reporter assays confirmed that miR-15a targets Lats1 through a miR-15a binding site in the Lats1 3'UTR. Overexpression of miR-15a in mOGCs not only inhibited proliferation and growth of mOGCs, but also induced aging of mOGCs. Western blot and qPCR analysis indicated that miR-15a suppresses the expression of the Hippo-YAP/TAZ pathway in mOGCs. When the exogenous miR-15a was expressed on mouse OGCs, it could elevate the cytotoxicity effect of TG on mOGCs. We conclude that tripterygium glycosides promote cytotoxicity, senescence, and apoptosis in ovarian granulosa cells by inducing endogenous miR-15a expression and inhibiting the Hippo-YAP/TAZ pathway.

AB Background: A low serum vitamin D concentration is associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Recently, several single nucleotid polymorphisms (SNPs) have been identified which influence vitamin D levels. If a causal relationship exists between vitamin D concentrations and T2DM, one would expect a similar association between the newly identified SNPs and T2DM risk. Therefore, this study investigated the association between four SNPs of cytochrome P450 family 2, subfamily R, peptide 1 (CYP2R1) gene, serum 25(OH)D-3 levels and T2DM.
   Methods: Three hundred and ninety-seven patients with confirmed T2DM, as well as 397 age- and gender matched controls were enrolled in this case-control study. Genotyping was performed by TaqMan probe assays. Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis and muitiple logistic regression analysis were performed to identify the possible risk genotype for vitamin D levels and T2DM, respectively. Generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction (GMDR) was used to analyze the gene-gene and gene-environment interactions.
   Results: The serum 25(OH)D-3 levels were significant lower in the T2DM group. Significant differences were observed between patients and controls in terms of the genotype distributions of rs1993116 (P = 0.048) and rs10766197 (P = 0.024). Similarly, rs1993116 and rs10766197 polymorphisms were found to be significantly associated with T2DM risk. AG + GG genotype carriers of the rs1993116 and rs10766197 polymorphisms could have an increased risk of developing T2DM compared with AA carriers, the OR and 95% CI were 1.64 (1.09-2.46) and 1.76 (1.18-2.65), respectively. However, none of the tested SNPs were independently associated with serum 25(OH)D-3 levels (P > 0.059). Gene-gene and gene-environment interaction analyses indicated that rs12794714-rs10766197 and rs12794714-vitamin D deficiency (VDD) models successfully predicted T2DM risk (P < 0.001).
   Conclusions: Rs1993116 and rs10766197 polymorphisms of CYP2R1 gene may be novel genetic markers for T2DM in China. Given the lack of association between SNPs and serum 25(OH)D-3 levels, well-designed future studies should be conducted with larger sample sizes in rural areas of China.

AB With the progress of modern medicine, oxygen therapy has become a crucial measure for the treatment of premature infants. As an environmental stimulus, in the normal development of lungs, oxygen plays a very important regulatory role. However, the problem is that long-term exposure to hyperoxia can interfere with the development of lungs, leading to irreversible developmental abnormalities. Now, the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is increasing year by year. The existing related research shows that although BPD is a multi-factor triggered disease, its main risk factors are the premature exposure to hyperoxia and the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS). As for premature infants, especially very premature babies and those with very low birth weight, prolonged exposure to high oxygen can affect and alter the normal developmental trajectories of lung tissue and vascular beds, triggering developmental disorders, such as BPD. In the relevant studies about human BPD, a large number of them support that ROS is associated with impaired lung development. Neonates, due to the damage in the development of alveolar, are specific to hyperoxia-induced inflammatory damage. This review while focusing on the role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of BPD, suggests that antioxidant measures may be effective to guard against BPD of preterm infants.

AB Plant RNA silencing systems are organized as a network, regulating plant developmental pathways and restraining invading viruses, by sharing cellular components with overlapping functions. Host regulatory networks operate either at the transcriptional level via RNA-directed DNA methylation, or at the post-transcriptional stage interfering with mRNA to restrict viral infection. However, viral-derived proteins, including suppressors of RNA silencing, favour virus establishment, and also affect plant developmental processes. In this investigation, we report that Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus-derived AC4 protein suppresses RNA silencing activity and mutational analysis of AC4 showed that Asn-50 in the SKNT-51 motif, in the C-terminal region, is a critical determinant of its RNA silencing suppressor activity. AC4 showed interaction with host AGO4 but not with AGO1, aggregated around the nucleus, and influenced cytosine methylation of the viral genome. The possible molecular mechanism by which AC4 interferes in the RNA silencing network, helps virus establishment, and affects plant development is discussed.

AB Background: Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and clopidogrel is a recommended treatment for coronary artery disease (CAD) patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to reduce the rate of ischemic events and stent thrombosis. However, high on-treatment platelet reactivity (HTPR) during clopidogrel therapy for some patients may lead to outcome failure and occurrence of cardiovascular events. Amounts of studies have proved that genetic factors may contribute to HTPR. In our study, we explored the predictive value of 10 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 8 genes indicated by exome sequencing with clopidogrel efficacy.
   Methods: Two hundred and forty-one Han Chinese CAD patients (mean age: 61 10 years) receiving dual antiplatelet therapy were recruited, among which 118 patients administered with 300 mg loading dose (LD) clopidogrel for 12-24 h and 123 subjects administered with 75 mg/day maintain dose (MD) clopidogrel for at least 5 days before discharge. The platelet reaction index (PRI) was determined to reflect clopidogrel response in the patients. Venous blood samples were drawn from all participants to extract genomic DNA. MassARRAY, Sanger sequencing and polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) were used to determine the genotypes of 10 SNPs.
   Results: Allelic tests showed significant differences in genotype distribution between HTPR and normal on treatment platelet reactivity (NTPR) patients for 3 SNPs including CYP2C19 rs4244285 (CYP2C19*2) (co-dominant model: p = 0.003, dominant model: p = 0.004, recessive model: p = 0.012), CRISPLD1 rs12115090 (co-dominant model: p = 0.011, dominant model: p = 0.004), and LTA4H rs11108379 (dominant model: p = 0.041). After adjusting for covariates including clinical characteristics of patients, concomitant medications and complications, we confirmed that carriers of the CYP2C19*2 showed significantly increased risk of HTPR (*2/*2 vs *1/*1: OR = 12.266, 95% CI: 1.336-112.592, p = 0.027; *1/*2 + *2/*2 vs *1/*1: OR = 2.202, 95% CI: 1.083-4.480, p = 0.029). Contrarily, carriers of the CRISPLD1 rs12115090 C allele showed significantly reduced risk of HTPR (CC vs AA: OR = 0.242, 95% CI: 0.078-0.752, p = 0.014; CA + CC vs AA: OR = 0.457, 95% CI: 0.232-0.904, p = 0.024) in Chinese CAD patients. In addition, carriers of the CYP2C19*2 allele showed significantly increased PRI (*1/*2 vs *1/*1: p = 0.008, 2/*2 vs 1/*1: p < 0.001, *2/*2 vs 1/*2: p = 0.011), while patients carrying the rs12115090 C allele showed significantly decreased PRI than the wild-type AA homozygotes (CA vs AA: p = 0.046, CA + CC vs AA: p = 0.023).
   Conclusion: CYP2C19*2 reduced the antiplatelet potency of clopidogrel and increased the risk of HTPR, while CRISPLD1 rs12115090 A > C polymorphism increased the antiplatelet potency of clopidogrel. Genetic tests, especially for CYP2C19*2 are recommended in Han Chinese CAD patients before using of clopidogrel.

AB The Chinese concave-eared torrent frog (Odorrana tormota) is the first known non-mammalian vertebrate that can communicate using ultrasound. In this species, females are approximately four times as large as males, in which the female growth rate is obviously higher than that of male. Until now, the molecular mechanisms underlying muscle growth development differences between male and female frogs have not been reported. Here, we integrated mRNA and miRNA expression profiles to reveal growth differences in the hindlimb muscles of 2-year-old frogs. Among 569 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), 69 were associated with muscle growth and regeneration. Fifty-one up-regulated genes in females were potentially involved in promoting muscle growth and regeneration, whereas 18 up-regulated genes in males may lead to muscle growth inhibition and fast-twitch muscle fiber contraction. 244 DEGs were enriched in mTOR and other protein synthesis signaling pathways, and protein degradation pathways, including lysosomal protease, calpain, caspase, and ubiquitin proteasome system pathways. It may interpret why female muscles grow faster than males. Based on expression differences of genes involved in glycolysis and oxidative metabolism, we speculated that the proportion of slow muscle fiber was higher and that of fast muscle fiber was lower in female compared with male muscle. Additionally, 767 miRNAs were identified, including 217 new miRNAs, and 6248 miRNA-negatively regulated mRNAs were predicted. The miRNA target genes were enriched in pathways related to muscle growth, protein synthesis, and degradation. Thus, in addition to the identified mRNA differential expressions, miRNAs may play other important roles in the differential regulation of hindlimb muscle growth between female and male O. tormota.

AB Objective: To investigate the regulatory mechanism of MEN1 gene in radiation-induced lung fibrosis in mice and provide a new theoretical basis for the clinical treatment of radiation pulmonary fibrosis.
   Methods: First, 80 C57BL/6 mice aged 8 weeks and weighing 18-22 g were selected, half of them were male and the other half were female. The mice were divided into control group and irradiation group (40 mice in each group) according to the method of the random number table. A radiation-induced lung fibrosis mouse model was established in which a single X-ray irradiation of 20 Gy was applied to the right lung in the irradiation group; H& E and Masson staining were used to verify whether the model was successful at 4, 8, 16 and 24 weeks after irradiation. The expression of MEN1, smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), Collagen-1 and transforming growth factor (TGF-beta) in lung tissue were detected by Western blot and qPCR. Secondly, in the mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line (MEF) and mouse lung epithelial cell line (MLE-12), we constructed cell models of MEN1 knockout and interference separately with the irradiation of 10 Gy X-rays. The expression of alpha-SMA, Collagen-1, and TGF-beta/Smads signaling pathway molecules was detected by qPCR. Finally, using the immunoprecipitation (IP) method, we can detect the interaction between Smad2 and the protein menin encoded by the MEN1 gene.
   Results: The results of the radiation pulmonary fibrosis model in mice showed that compared with the control group, the alveolar septum widens, the alveolar integrity decreases, the lung tissue slightly thickens, and a small amount of collagen deposits appear after 4-8 weeks in the model group. At twenty-fourth weeks, a large number of cells in the interstitial space of the lung tissue and a localized focal fibrosis area were observed. Further study found that radiation induced fibrogenic inflammatory cytokines TGF-beta up-regulation, down-regulation of MEN1 gene expression, and then enhanced the expression of alpha-SMA and promotes the transformation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts; At the same time, the expression of Collagen-1 was enhanced, which suggested that the extra cellular matrix was overconcentrated and eventually promoted the formation of pulmonary fibrosis. In vitro, we found that knockout and interference of MEN1 gene can significantly enhance radiation-induced fibrosis, and up-regulate the expression of downstream molecules Smad2 and Smad3 of TGF-beta signaling pathway, and down regulate the expression of Smad7. Furthermore, it played an important role in regulating the process of radio-nuclide fibrosis.
   Conclusion: MEN1 plays a key role in the formation of pulmonary fibrosis by regulating the secretion of TGF-beta and the activation of TGF-beta/Smads signaling pathway.

AB Colorectal cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related death. Glutaminolysis has been suggested as a therapeutic target for cancer. Costunolide is a natural sesquiterpene lactone showing potent antitumor activity. Our studies were aimed at evaluating how costunolide affected glutaminolysis leading to proliferation inhibition in human colorectal cancer cells. Costunolide suppressed viability and proliferation of HCT116 cells concentration-dependently, but did not apparently affect human intestinal epithelial cells. Costunolide at 20 mu M reduced viability and proliferation of HCT116 cells time-dependently. Costunolide also repressed phosphorylation of mTOR and its downstream kinases p70S6K and 4E-BP1. Examinations of glutaminolysis metabolites showed that costunolide increased intracellular glutamine levels, but decreased intracellular levels of glutamate, alpha-ketoglutarate (alpha-KG), and ATP in HCT116 cells, suggesting costunolide blockade of glutaminolysis. Furthermore, costunolide inhibited promoter activity of glutaminase 1 (GLS1), the first rate-limiting enzyme in glutaminolysis, and reduced mRNA and protein expression of GLS1 in HCT116 cells, The GLS1 inhibitor BPTES, similar to costunolide, significantly reduced intracellular levels of alpha-KG and ATP and inhibited proliferation in HCT116 cells. Finally, costunolide increased phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of p53 in HCT116 cells. Both p53 inhibitor pifithrin-alpha and p53 siRNA significantly rescued costunolide suppression of GLS1 promoter activity and expression in HCT116 cells. These data in aggregate suggested that activation of p53 was required for costunolide inhibition of GLS1 resulting in blockade of glutaminolysis and inhibition of proliferation in colorectal cancer cells, which was a novel mechanism underlying the antitumor activity of costunolide against colorectal cancer.

AB Chemoreception is critical for the survival of insects. Insects have a variety of behavioral responses, such as mating, host searching and ovipositing, in response to different odor signals detected in their living environment. Trichogramma chilonis, an egg parasitoid, acts as an efficient and effective biocontrol reagent for many agricultural and forestry insect pests in many parts of China. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism of the olfaction-evoked behavior in T. chilonis. In the present study, we conducted transcriptome profiling analysis of T. chilonis based on the Illumina high-throughput sequencing platform in order to explore differences of chemoreception between male and female T. chilonis. In this study, a total of 85 chemosensory genes were identified from transcriptomic data, including 45 odorant receptors (ORs), 22 odorant binding proteins (OBPs), 14 ionotropic receptors (IRs), 2 sensory neuron membrane proteins (SNMPs) and 2 chemosensory proteins (CSPs). From the analysis of the transcriptome, most of the candidate olfactory genes had similar expression levels in males and females, including a few OR and OBP genes (TchiOR38, TchiOR39, TchiOR40, TchiOE41, TchiOR42, TchiOR43, TchiOR44, TchiOR45, TchiOBP1, TchiOBP4, TchiOBP10, TchiOBP12, TchiOBP18 and TchiOBP19) which showed male-biased expression. Some annotated unigenes were chosen randomly to have qRT-PCR, which verified the correctness of analysis of transcriptome in T. chilonis. This is the first study to obtain and identify candidate genes related to chemoreception in T. chilonis. Our work lays a solid foundation for related future research on the chemosensory system of T. chilonis at the molecular level and helps advance the use of T. chilonis as biological control agents.

AB BMI-1 (B-lymphoma Mo-MLV insertion region 1) is a key protein partner in polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) that helps in maintaining the integrity of the complex. It is also a key player in ubiquitination of histone H2A which affects gene expression pattern involved in various cellular processes such as cell proliferation, growth, DNA repair, apoptosis and senescence. In many cancers, Overexpression of BMI1 correlates with advanced stages of disease, aggressive clinicopathological behavior, poor prognosis resistance to radiation and chemotherapy. BMI1 is emerging as a key player in EMT, chemo-resistance and cancer sternness. Overexpression is observed in various cancer types such as breast, primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), gastric, ovarian, head and neck, pancreatic and lung cancer. Studies have shown that experimental reduction of BMI protein level in tumor cells results in inhibition of cell proliferation, induction of apoptosis and/or senescence, and increases susceptibility to cytotoxic agents and radiation therapy. Thus, inhibition of BMI1 expression particularly in breast cancer stem cells can be used as a potential strategy for the complete elimination of tumor and to prevent disease relapse. On other hand PTEN is known to be an important tumor suppressor next to p53. In many cancers particularly in breast cancer, p53 and PTEN undergo mutations. Studies have indicated the functional and mechanistic link between the BMI-1oncoprotein and tumor suppressor PTEN in the development and progression of cancer. The current review focuses on recent findings of how oncogenicity and chemo-resistance are caused by BMI1. It also highlights the transcriptional regulation between BMI1 and PTEN that dictates the therapeutic outcome in cancers where the functional p53 is absent. Herein, we have clearly demonstrated the regulation of transcription at genomic loci of BMI1 and PTEN in cancerous tissue or cells and the possible epigenetic regulation by histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) at BMI1 and PTEN loci that may provide some clue for the possible therapy against TNBC in near future.

AB Heat shock proteins (Hsps) play a key role for regulation of the changes during different stress conditions including salinity, drought, heavy metal and extreme temperature. Molecular based studies on the response mechanisms of forest trees to abiotic stresses started in 2006 when Populus trichocarpa genome sequence was completed as a model tree species. In recent years, bioinformatic analyzes have been carried out to determine functional gene regions of tree species. In this study, sHsp, Hsp40, Hsp60, Hsp90 and Hsp100 gene family members were identified in poplar genome. Some bioinformatics analyses were conducted, such as: identification of DNA/protein sequences, chromosomal localization, gene structure, calculation of genomic duplications, determination of phylogenetic groups, examination of protected motif regions, identification of gene ontology categories, modeling of protein 3D structure, determination of miRNA targeting genes, examination of sHsp, Hsp40, Hsp60, Hsp90 and Hsp100 gene family members in transcriptome data during salinity stress. As a result of bioinformatic analyzes made on P. trichocarpa genome; 60, 145, 49, 34, 12 and 90 genes belonging to members of sHsp, Hsp40, Hsp60, Hsp70, Hsp90 and Hsp100 protein families were firstly defined within the scope of this study. A total of 390 genes belonging to all Hsps gene families were characterized using different bioinformatics tools. In addition, salinity stress was applied to Populus tremula L. (Samsun) naturally grown in Turkey, Hybrid poplar species I-214 (Populus euramericana Dode. Guinier) and Black Poplar species (Populus nigra L.), Geyve and N.03.368.A clones. The expression levels of the selected Hsps genes were determined by the qRT-PCR method. After salt stress application in various poplar clones, expression levels of genes including PtsHsp-11, PtsHsp-21, PtsHsp-36, PtHsp40-113, PtHsp40-117, PtHsp60-31, PtHsp60-33, PtHsp60-38, PtHsp60-49, PtHsp70-09, PtHsp70-12, 33, PtHsp90-09, PtHsp90-12, PtHsp100-21, and PtHsp100-75 were increased. The role of the Hsps genes during salt stress has been revealed. Together with detailed bioinformatics analyses, gene expression analysis greatly contributes to understand functions of these gene family members. This research serves as a blueprint for future studies and offers a significant clue for the further study of the functions of this important gene family. Moreover, determined genes in this study can also be used for cloning studies in agricultural practices.

AB Although increasing aberrantly expressed circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been identified among many human cancer tissues, their roles in tumor progression still remain largely unknown. In bladder cancer, the function of hsa_circ_0000144 has not been reported. In our study, we found hsacirc_0000144 as a novel oncogene in bladder cancer by bioinformatics analysis. We found that hsa_circ_0000144 expression was significantly upregulated in bladder cancer tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues, and its high expression was related with poor prognosis. Additionally, knockdown of hsa_circ_0000144 remarkably suppressed the proliferation and invasion of bladder cancer cells in vitro. Hsa_circ_0000144 silence also led to reduced tumor volumes in vivo. In mechanism, we found that hsa_circ_0000144 was a sponge of miR-217 while miR-217 targeted RUNX2. Our results indicated that the expression of miR-217 was inversely correlated with that of both hsa_circ_0000144 and RUNX2 in bladder cancer tissues. Rescue assays showed that either inhibition of miR-217 or restoration of RUNX2 reversed the suppressive effects of hsa_circ_0000144 knockdown on bladder cancer cell proliferation and invasion. Taken together, these findings demonstrated that hsa_circ_0000144 exerts oncogenic roles in bladder cancer via repressing miR-217 to facilitate RUNX2 expression.

AB It has been demonstrated that microRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in the regulation of melanogenesis and hair color in mammals. Short tandem target mimic (STTM) has been used to effectively block small RNA functions in plants and animals. We previously showed that miR508-3p plays a functional role in regulating melanogenesis in alpaca melanocytes by directly targeting microphthalmia (MITF). To verify the effect of miR508-3p function on melanogenesis in alpaca melanocytes, miR-508-3p was blocked using STTM technology in the present research. miR508-3p was predicted to target the gene encoding SRY-box6 (SOX6) by bioinformatics. The luciferase reporter assay indicated that miR508-3p regulates SRY-box6 (SOX6) expression by targeting its 3'UTR. Here, STTM-miR508-3p overexpression in alpaca melanocytes blocked the expression of miR-508-3p and up-regulated SOX6 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels, resulting in increasing the expression of key melanogenic genes, including cAMP responsive element (CRE) binding protein (CREB), MITF, tyrosinase (TYR) and tyrosinase-related protein 1 and 2 (TYRP1 and TYRP2). STTM-miR508-3p overexpression in melanocytes also resulted in increased melanin production, including total alkali soluble melanogenesis (ASM), eumelanogenesis (EM) and pheomelanogenesis (PM). Additionally, we identified melanin granules in alpaca melanocytes transfected with STTM-miR508-3p under Fontana-Masson staining. These results suggest that STTM-miR508-3p could up-regulate melanogenesis by effectively blocking miR508-3p.

AB Several studies inspected the relationship between miR-218 rs11134527 polymorphism and the risk of some human cancers, but the findings remains controversial. We designed an update meta-analysis aiming to validate the association between rs11134527 polymorphism of miR-218 and cancer risk. Eligible studies including 7989 cancer cases and 8761 controls were recognized by searching Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and Google scholar databases. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated to quantitatively evaluate the association between rs11134527 variant and cancer risk. The overall results indicated no significant relationship between miR-218 rs11134527 polymorphism and cancer risk in codominant, dominant, recessive, overdominant, and allele inheritance model tested. Stratified analysis showed that rs11134527 variant significantly increased the risk of developing esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) in heterozygous codominant (OR = 1.32, 95% Cl = 1.03-1.69, p = 0.03, AG vs GG) inheritance model.
   In summary, the findings of this meta-analysis did not support an association between miR-218 rs11134527 polymorphism and cancer risk. Stratified analysis showed that rs11134527 variant significantly increased the risk of developing ESCC. Larger and well-designed researches are needed to estimate this association in detail.

AB Gastric cancer (GC) is a deadly disease with high incidence worldwide in recent years. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) were found to play imperative roles in many biological processes, such as cancer development and progression. Specifically, TP73-AS1, a novel cancer-related IncRNA, was documented to be up-regulated in several malignancies, but the clinical significance and functional role of TP73-AS1 in GC is still unknown. RTqPCR was performed to evaluate TP73-AS1 transcription in GC tissue specimens and cell lines. In addition, the correlation between TP73-AS1 transcription and clinicopathologic features was further evaluated. Moreover, the effects of TP73-AS1 on GC cell were measured in vitro and in vivo. The data documented that TP73-AS1 was enhanced in GC tissues and cells, and TP73-AS1 transcription level was tightly associated with tumor size, TNM stage, and overall survival in 76 GC patients. What's more, decreased TP73-AS1 could restrain cell growth and colony-forming capacity and promoted apoptosis partly by regulating Bcl-2/caspase-3 pathway. Importantly, TP73-AS1 could promote xenograft growth in vivo. Silencing of TP73-AS1 inhibited GC cell migratory and invasive properties partly by reversing snail-mediated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Collectively, this study may help to develop the treatment strategy for GC.

AB Objective: Our study aimed to explore the relationship between CD36 methylation and the development of lung cancer and investigate the effect of combine treatment of Decitabine and Chidamide in lung cancer.
   Methods: The differentially expression genes in tumor samples and normal samples were determined by microarray analysis. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was utilized to analyze gene expression data of lung cancer and the hub genes were screened in the modules. Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) was conducted to detect the methylation level of CD36 in lung cancer cells. QRT-PCR analysis and western blotting were performed to explore the relative mRNA expression and protein level. MTT assays, wound healing assay, Transwell assays and flow cytometry were conducted to clarify the cell proliferation, migration, invasion and cell cycle of lung carcinoma cell lines in vitro respectively. By xenograft and immunohistochemistry, the effect of co-treatment of Decitabine and Chidamide was further verified in vivo.
   Results: The heatmap displayed that the top 20 differential mRNA-expression gene in lung cancer tissues and normal tissues in which CD36 was low expressed in the tumor samples and high expressed in the normal samples. By WGCNA, CD36 was selected to be the hub gene in the brown module. And then CD36 was confirmed to be differential expressed and hypermethylated in lung cancer through qRT-PCR and western blotting. CD36 inhibited the lung cancer cell proliferation, promoted cell apoptosis, blocked cell cycle at GO/G1 phase, and inhibited cell migration. What's more, we found that Decitabine (DCTB) and Chidamide (CDM) co-treatment induced de-methylation and re-expression of silenced CD36 by conducting the vivo experiments. DCTB + CDM co-treatment synergistically suppressed tumor growth.
   Conclusion: Our results showed that the high methylation of CD36 in lung cancer played an important role in the procession of lung cancer and Decitabine joint Chidamide had obvious effect of inhibiting the growth of lung tumor.

AB Compartmentalization of Na+ into vacuoles is considered to be the most critical aspect of salt tolerance in H. glomeratus, an annual, succulent halophyte. Previous analysis of transcriptome involved in the H. glomeratus salt stress response relied on next-generation sequencing technologies that limit the capture of accurately spliced, full-length isoforms. To gain deeper insights into its salt stress response, we used the H. glomeratus Iso-Seq transcriptome database as a reference, and subsequent next-generation sequencing was subjected to various NaCl concentrations of leaves from plants revealed 115 upregulated and 87 downregulated differentially expressed isoforms (core DEIs). The majority of the core DEIs were involved in carbohydrate metabolism and energy production and conversion. In contrast, levels of known isoforms encoding Na+ transporters did not change significantly under salt stress. However, 16 core DEIs of unknown function were predicted to possess transmembrane domains, suggesting that these candidate isoforms could be involved in Na+ transport in H. glomeratus. These results suggest a potential means for identification of novel Na+ transporters, in addition to providing a foundation for further investigation of Na+ transport networks in halophytes.

AB A novel computational framework which combines the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) and an improved immersed boundary method (IBM) based on a dynamic geometry-adaptive Cartesian grid system is introduced for the fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems at moderate and high Reynolds numbers. In this framework, the fluid dynamics is obtained by solving the discrete lattice Boltzmann equation. The boundary conditions at the fluid-structure interfaces are handled by an improved IBM based on a feedback scheme, which drives the predicted flow velocity (calculated after the LBM stream process without the IBM body force) near the immersed boundaries to match the solid velocity. In the present IBM, the feedback coefficient is mathematically derived and explicitly approximated. The Lagrangian force density is divided into two parts: one is the traction caused by the predicted flow velocity, and the other is caused by the acceleration of the immersed boundary. Such treatment significantly enhances the numerical stability for modelling FSI problems involving small structure-to-fluid mass ratios. A novel dynamic geometry-adaptive refinement is applied to provide fine resolution around the immersed geometries and coarse resolution in the far field. The overlapping grids between two adjacent refinements consist of two layers. In order to enhance the numerical stability, two-layer "ghost nodes" are generated within the immersed body domain which is a nonfluid area. The movement of fluid-structure interfaces only causes adding or removing grids at the boundaries of refinements and consequently a high mesh-update efficiency is guaranteed. Finally, large eddy simulation models are incorporated into the framework to model turbulent flows at relatively high Reynolds numbers. Several validation cases, including an impulsively started flow over a vertical plate, flow over stationary and oscillating cylinders, flow over flapping foils, flexible filaments in a uniform flow, turbulent flow over a wavy boundary, flow over a stationary sphere and a dragonfly in hovering flight, are conducted to verify the accuracy and fidelity of the present solver over a range of Reynolds numbers.

   identification
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS
LA English
DT Article
DE Time reversal; Source identification; Scatterer identification;
   Refocusing; Inverse problems; Elastodynamics
ID INVERSE PROBLEMS; XFEM
AB We propose a computational method which improves the identification of sources and scatterers in a two-dimensional elastic medium using the Time Reversal (TR) technique. The identification procedure makes use of partial numerical data available at a small number of sensors. While in realistic applications these data are obtained by lab or field measurements, in the present work they are synthesized by solving the corresponding forward problem. We introduce an "augmentation" procedure that is utilized in addition to the TR technique and investigate its benefits. The augmentation procedure involves the solution of a suitable elliptic problem at selected time steps. In practice, one needs to solve, as a pre-process, a small number of "fundamental" elliptic problems which is equal to the number of measured quantities. A version of the augmentation procedure, which is easier to implement and involves almost no computational cost, is also presented. The local elastic energy in the domain is employed to decide whether the TR solution has properly refocused at the source. Cost functionals, whose minima are sought, are constructed for the source and scatterer identification problems. We conclude that augmentation improves the identification performance, in particular in the presence of noisy measurements. In some cases augmented TR succeeds in the identification whereas non-augmented TR fails. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we study the finite volume method for solving the time-fractional diffusion equation: partial derivative(alpha)(t)u - div(A del u) = f, 0 < alpha < 1. We present and analyze a fully discrete numerical scheme which is based on the linear finite volume method for the spatial discretization and the LI difference approximation to partial derivative(alpha)(t)u. We first establish a new error bound of 0 (Delta t(1+delta-alpha))-order for the Ll formula under the condition of u(t) epsilon C-1,C-8[0,T] where delta epsilon [0, 1] is the Holder continuity index. Then, we prove that this fully discrete finite volume scheme is unconditionally stable and the discrete solution admits the optimal error estimate of 0 (Delta t(1+delta-alpha) + h(2) )-order in the L2 -norm. Numerical examples are provided to support our theoretical analysis. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper we propose and test the validity of simple and easy-to-implement algorithms within the immersed boundary framework geared towards large scale simulations involving thousands of deformable bodies in highly turbulent flows. First, we introduce a fast moving least squares (fast-MLS) approximation technique with which we speed up the process of building transfer functions during the simulations which leads to considerable reductions in computational time. We compare the accuracy of the fast-MLS against the exact moving least squares (MLS) for the standard problem of uniform flow over a sphere. In order to overcome the restrictions set by the resolution coupling of the Lagrangian and Eulerian meshes in this particular immersed boundary method, we present an adaptive Lagrangian mesh refinement procedure that is capable of drastically reducing the number of required nodes of the basic Lagrangian mesh when the immersed boundaries can move and deform. Finally, a coarse-grained collision detection algorithm is presented which can detect collision events between several Lagrangian markers residing on separate complex geometries with minimal computational overhead.

AB It is well-known that by placing judiciously chosen image point forces and doublets to the Stokeslet above a flat wall, the no-slip boundary condition can be conveniently imposed on the wall Blake (1971) [8]. However, to further impose periodic boundary conditions on directions parallel to the wall usually involves tedious derivations because single or double periodicity in Stokes flow may require the periodic unit to have no net force, which is not satisfied by the well-known image system. In this work we present a force-neutral image system. This neutrality allows us to represent the Stokes image system in a universal formulation for non-periodic, singly periodic and doubly periodic geometries. This formulation enables the black-box style usage of fast kernel summation methods. We demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of this new image method with the periodic kernel independent fast multipole method in both non-periodic and periodic geometries. We then extend this new image system to other widely used Stokes fundamental solutions, including the Laplacian of the Stokeslet and the Rotne-Prager-Yamakawa tensor. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

ID SIMULATION; HOMOGENIZATION; DYNAMICS
AB The Bloch-Torrey equation describes the evolution of the spin (usually water proton) magnetization under the influence of applied magnetic field gradients and is commonly used in numerical simulations for diffusion MRI and NMR. Microscopic heterogeneity inside the imaging voxel is modeled by interfaces inside the simulation domain, where a discontinuity in the magnetization across the interfaces is produced via a permeability coefficient on the interfaces. To avoid having to simulate on a computational domain that is the size of an entire imaging voxel, which is often much larger than the scale of the microscopic heterogeneity as well as the mean spin diffusion displacement, smaller representative volumes of the imaging medium can be used as the simulation domain. In this case, the exterior boundaries of a representative volume either must be far away from the initial positions of the spins or suitable boundary conditions must be found to allow the movement of spins across these exterior boundaries.
   Many approaches have been taken to solve the Bloch-Torrey equation but an efficient high performance computing framework is still missing. In this paper, we present formulations of the interface as well as the exterior boundary conditions that are computationally efficient and suitable for arbitrary order finite elements and parallelization. In particular, the formulations are based on the partition of unity concept which allows for a discontinuous solution across interfaces conforming with the mesh with weak enforcement of real (in the case of interior interfaces) and artificial (in the case of exterior boundaries) permeability conditions as well as an operator splitting for the exterior boundary conditions. The method is straightforward to implement and it is available in FEniCS for moderate-scale simulations and in FEniCS-HPC for large-scale simulations. The order of accuracy of the resulting method is validated in numerical tests and a good scalability is shown for the parallel implementation. We show that the simulated dMRI signals offer good approximations to reference signals in cases where the latter are available and we performed simulations for a realistic model of a neuron to show that the method can be used for complex geometries.

AB The symmetric formulation of the electroencephalography (EEG) forward problem is a well-known and widespread equation thanks to the high level of accuracy that it delivers. However, this equation is first kind in nature and gives rise to ill-conditioned problems when the discretization density or the brain conductivity contrast increases, resulting in numerical instabilities and increasingly slow solutions. This work addresses and solves this problem by proposing a new regularized symmetric formulation. The new scheme is obtained by leveraging on Calderon identities which allow to introduce a dual symmetric equation that, combined with the standard one, results in a second kind operator which is both stable and well-conditioned under all the above mentioned conditions. The new formulation presented here can be easily integrated into existing EEG imaging packages since it can be obtained with the same computational technology required by the standard symmetric formulation. The performance of the new scheme is substantiated by both theoretical developments and numerical results which corroborate the theory and show the practical impact of the new technique.

AB Time-domain impedance boundary conditions (TDIBCs) can be enforced using the impedance, the admittance, or the scattering operator. This article demonstrates the computational advantage of the last, even for nonlinear TDIBCs, with the linearized Euler equations. This is achieved by a systematic semi-discrete energy analysis of the weak enforcement of a generic nonlinear TDIBC in a discontinuous Galerkin finite element method. In particular, the analysis highlights that the sole definition of a discrete model is not enough to fully define a TDIBC. To support the analysis, an elementary physical nonlinear scattering operator is derived and its computational properties are investigated in an impedance tube. Then, the derivation of time-delayed broadband TDIBCs from physical reflection coefficient models is carried out for single degree of freedom acoustical liners. A high-order discretization of the derived time-local formulation, which consists in composing a set of ordinary differential equations with a transport equation, is applied to two flow ducts.

AB A discrete unified gas kinetic scheme (DUGKS) coupled with the immersed boundary (IB) method is developed to perform interface-resolved simulation of particle-laden flows. The present method (IB-DUGKS) preserves the respective advantages of the IB and DUGKS, i.e., the flexibility and efficiency for treating complex flows, and the robustness and low numerical-dissipation. In IB-DUGKS, the IB method is used to treat the fluid-solid interfaces and the DUGKS is applied to simulate the fluid flow, making use of the Lagrangian and Eulerian meshes, respectively. Those two meshes are fully independent, which contributes to the avoidance of grid regeneration when a solid particle moves. Specifically, in the present implementation of IB-DUGKS, the no-slip boundary condition at the particle surface is accurately enforced by introducing an efficient iterative forcing algorithm, and the IB force induced by the particle boundary is conveniently incorporated into the DUGKS with the Strang-Splitting scheme. The accuracy of the IB-DUGKS is first verified in the flows past a stationary cylinder and an oscillating cylinder in a quiescent fluid. After that, several well-established two- and three-dimensional particulate flow problems are simulated, including the sedimentation of a particle and the DKT dynamics of two particles in a channel, and a group of particles settling in an enclosure. In all test cases, the results are in good agreement with the data available in the literature, demonstrating that the proposed IB-DUGKS is a promising tool for simulating particulate flows.

AB State-of-the-art computer codes for simulating real physical systems are often characterized by vast number of input parameters. Performing uncertainty quantification (UQ) tasks with Monte Carlo (MC) methods is almost always infeasible because of the need to perform hundreds of thousands or even millions of forward model evaluations in order to obtain convergent statistics. One, thus, tries to construct a cheap-to-evaluate surrogate model to replace the forward model solver. For systems with large numbers of input parameters, one has to address the curse of dimensionality through suitable dimensionality reduction techniques. A popular class of dimensionality reduction methods are those that attempt to recover a low-dimensional representation of the high-dimensional feature space. However, such methods often tend to overestimate the intrinsic dimensionality of the input feature space. In this work, we demonstrate the use of deep neural networks (DNN) to construct surrogate models for numerical simulators. We parameterize the structure of the DNN in a manner that lends the DNN surrogate the interpretation of recovering a low-dimensional nonlinear manifold. The model response is a parameterized nonlinear function of the low-dimensional projections of the input. We think of this lowdimensional manifold as a nonlinear generalization of the notion of the active subspace. Our approach is demonstrated with a problem on uncertainty propagation in a stochastic elliptic partial differential equation (SPDE) with uncertain diffusion coefficient. We deviate from traditional formulations of the SPDE problem by lifting the assumption of fixed lengthscales of the uncertain diffusion field. Instead we attempt to solve a more challenging problem of learning a map between an arbitrary snapshot of the diffusion field and the response. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Co-existence of the physical and numerical boundary conditions makes implicit boundary treatment a particularly difficult problem in modern CFD simulations. Previous studies adopted space-time extrapolation or specially designed partial differential equations on the boundaries that are different from those of interior points. They are often formulated in terms of primitive variables, and are very challenging for complicated boundary types to be converted to, and implemented in, the conservative variables that are preferred in numerical simulations. More importantly, different boundary equations or different extrapolation techniques may compromise the stability, accuracy, or convergence rate of the A-stable schemes that are developed for interior points. A new methodology for implicit boundary treatment is proposed in this study. By introducing a simple correction matrix T, a set of generalized equations partial derivative Q/partial derivative t = (I + T)R are developed in terms of conservative variables. It is applicable for both the interior domain (T = 0) and the boundaries (T not equal 0). It is in a partial differential equation form, satisfies the boundary conditions accurately, independent of the time and spatial discretizations. Any one-sided schemes can be used on the boundaries but still maintain the upwind property. Implicit solution techniques are made significantly easy to implement using, for example, the data-parallel lower-upper relation method and the Newton method (combined with the GMRES method for subsidiary iterations). Numerical experiments show that the proposed methodology produces stable simulations for very large CFL numbers and preserve the imposed boundary values accurately. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB In this paper, a new type of high-order finite difference and finite volume multi-resolution weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) schemes is presented for solving hyperbolic conservation laws. We only use the information defined on a hierarchy of nested central spatial stencils and do not introduce any equivalent multi-resolution representation. These new WENO schemes use the same large stencils as the classical WENO schemes in [25,45] could obtain the optimal order of accuracy in smooth regions, and could simultaneously suppress spurious oscillations near discontinuities. The linear weights of such WENO schemes can be any positive numbers on the condition that their sum equals one. This is the first time that a series of unequal-sized hierarchical central spatial stencils are used in designing high-order finite difference and finite volume WENO schemes. These new WENO schemes are simple to construct and can be easily implemented to arbitrary high order of accuracy and in higher dimensions. Benchmark examples are given to demonstrate the robustness and good performance of these new WENO schemes. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Undulatory motion in aquatic animals is attained through waves of muscle contraction. Coordinated muscle contraction is produced by the orchestration of contralaterally anti-phased, caudally propagating waves of neural activity that deliver stimuli to skeletal muscles. This physical deformation generates muscle bending moments along the length of the body. These resultant moments in combination with hydrodynamic, inertial, and the body's constitutive forces (e.g., elasticity) determine the deformation kinematics for swimming. Hydrodyamically resolved simulations of neurally controlled locomotion can facilitate experimental neurobiologists in identifying and decoding activation patterns associated with distinct motor behaviors in swimming animals. When neurally activated, muscle stiffness and consequently the effective body stiffness dynamically increases. Computationally resolving large deformations for an effectively stiff, viscoelastic body immersed in fluid is expensive. For methods that explicitly couple the fluid-body interactions, the body's large elastic modulus imposes severe limitations on the time step size required to ensure numerical stability. Fully implicit methods are generally no more computationally efficient. When the effective body stiffness is sufficiently large, the realized deformation kinematics closely follow the time-varying preferred (or reference) configuration which is implied by the muscle dynamics. Rather than resolving the numerically stiff, elastic equations for the body, a fast and efficient, constraint-based self-propulsion formulation is employed to directly impose the preferred swimming kinematics. With this approach, the exploration of neuromechanical model for propulsion using fully resolved computational fluid dynamics becomes more tractable. The presented method is robust and may be employed to investigate the neuromechanics of motor control and locomotion. Two and three dimensional simulations (2D and 3D) demonstrating the neural activation patterns' effect on maneuverability, speed, and feedback driven obstacle navigation are presented. The phase lag between curvature and moment waves, a manifestation of neurally controlled propulsion, is reproduced, further signifying the robustness of the presented method. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB A new phase change model has been developed for the simulation of incompressible multiphase magnetohydrodynamics based on the Volume-of-Fluid method. To decrease the pressure oscillations when large density contrasts are present between the liquid phase and the vapor phase, a smooth distribution of sharp mass transfer rate within a narrow region surrounding the interface is adopted, and a ghost-cell approach is used to impose the saturating temperature at the liquid-vapor interface when solving the energy equation. After that, the method has been implemented in an incompressible multiphase magnetohydrodynamics solver developed in our previous work (Zhang and Ni (2014) [3]). Moreover, when computing the electromagnetic fields, a cut-cell approach is implemented to keep the sharpness of the interface, which is treated as an electrically insulating boundary as it translates and deforms with the fluid. The phase change model has been verified for a series of one-dimensional, two-dimensional and three-dimensional problems, while the numerical results agree well with either the theoretical solutions or the experimental data. In particular, by simulating the vapor bubble rising in superheated liquid under nonzero gravity in presence of external magnetic field, the magnetohydrodynamics effect on the vaporization of the rising bubble is investigated and we observe the magnetic fields to suppress the vapor bubble growth during the phase change. At last, both two-dimensional and three-dimensional film boiling simulations are conducted, which show good qualitative agreement with heat transfer correlations, and the vapor bubble is found to elongate along the direction of the magnetic field during its growth, moreover, the time instant for the vapor bubble to detach from the film is also delayed.

AB GPUSPH is an implementation of Weakly-Compressible Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics with an explicit predictor-corrector integration scheme, that takes advantage of the parallel nature of the method to run on Graphic Processing Units (GPUs). Despite the massive speed-up granted by the use of GPUs, the application of GPUSPH to the simulation of highly viscous fluids is still problematic, due to the severe time-stepping restrictions imposed by the explicit integration scheme when the viscous term becomes dominant. This is an issue in the simulation of lava flows, where the thermal-dependent rheology can lead to kinematic viscosities in the order of 10(4) m(2) s(-1) or more at low temperatures. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a semi-implicit integration scheme, where only the viscous part of the momentum equation is solved implicitly. Here we show the significant advantages of our approach in terms of simulation run times as well as better quality of the results over the fully explicit scheme. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB A new algorithmic approach is presented for the generation and successive equilibration of polymer configurations under conditions of extreme confinement where the inter-wall distance, in at least one dimension, approaches the diameter of the spherical monomers. It significantly improves on the Monte Carlo (MC) protocol described in Karayiannis and Laso (2008) [126]. The algorithm is designed to generate highly confined packings of freely-jointed chains of hard spheres of uniform size. Spatial confinement is achieved by including flat, parallel impenetrable walls in one or more dimensions of the simulation box. The present MC scheme allows the systematic study of the effect of chain length, polydispersity, volume fraction, bond tolerance (gap), cell aspect ratio and level of confinement on the short- and long-range structure of polymer chains near and far from the confining planes. In the present study we focus on the efficiency of the MC protocol in generating, equilibrating, and configurationally decorrelating chain assemblies with average lengths ranging from N = 12 to 1000 monomers and at volume fractions from dilute up to the maximally random jammed (MRJ) state. Starting from cubic amorphous cells filled with polymer chains, the MC algorithm is able to reach quasi 2-d (plate-like) and 1-d (tube-like) states under conditions of extreme confinement and/or cell aspect ratio where the inter-wall distance approaches the diameter of beads forming the chains. A comparison with corresponding bulk packings shows the similarities and differences produced by extreme spatial confinement. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

   Filamentation filtration
AB An Eulerian phase-space discretized Vlasov-Poisson simulation code that incorporates filamentation filtration is introduced. The code is based on the flux-balance method, which is extended to include the filtration. A novel method for removing a localized numerical instability at the velocity boundaries is introduced and it is shown that the code is otherwise stable for a limited but effective range of filamentation filter widths. It is demonstrated that filamentation filtration does not remove the recurrence problem; recurrence does arise in the absence of filamentation. Simulations of one-dimensional, electrostatic Landau damping, and two-stream instability are presented. For these simulations, favorable comparisons with the results of a well-established Fourier-Fourier transformed spectral code are discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The present paper deals with a new improvement of hierarchical multi-dimensional limiting process for resolving the subcell distribution of high-order methods on two-dimensional mixed meshes. From previous studies, the multi-dimensional limiting process (MLP) was hierarchically extended to the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method and the flux reconstruction/correction procedure via reconstruction (FR/CPR) method on simplex meshes. It was reported that the hierarchical MLP (hMLP) shows several remarkable characteristics such as the preservation of the formal order-of-accuracy in smooth region and a sharp capturing of discontinuities in an efficient and accurate manner. At the same time, it was also surfaced that such characteristics are valid only on simplex meshes, and numerical Gibbs-Wilbraham oscillations are concealed in subcell distribution in the form of high-order polynomial modes. Subcell Gibbs-Wilbraham oscillations become potentially unstable near discontinuities and adversely affect numerical solutions in the sense of cell-averaged solutions as well as subcell distributions. In order to overcome the two issues, the behavior of the hMLP on mixed meshes is mathematically examined, and the simplex-decomposed Pl-projected MLP condition and smooth extrema detector are derived. Secondly, a troubled-boundary detector is designed by analyzing the behavior of computed solutions across boundary-edges. Finally, hMLP_BD is proposed by combining the simplex-decomposed Pl-projected MLP condition and smooth extrema detector with the troubled-boundary detector. Through extensive numerical tests, it is confirmed that the hMLP_BD scheme successfully eliminates subcell oscillations and provides reliable subcell distributions on two-dimensional triangular grids as well as mixed grids, while preserving the expected order-of-accuracy in smooth region.

AB We introduce a level-set strategy to find the geometry of confinement that will guide the self-assembly of block copolymers to a given target design in the context of lithography. The methodology is based on a shape optimization algorithm, where the level-set normal velocity is defined as the pressure field computed through a self-consistent field theory simulation. We present numerical simulations that demonstrate that this methodology is capable of finding guiding templates for a variety of target arrangements of cylinders and thus is an effective approach to the inverse directed self-assembly problem.

AB This paper presents a high-order method for solving an interface problem for the Poisson equation on embedded meshes through a coupled finite element and integral equation approach. The method is capable of handling homogeneous or inhomogeneous jump conditions without modification and retains high-order convergence close to the embedded interface. We present finite element-integral equation (FE-IE) formulations for interior, exterior, and interface problems. The treatments of the exterior and interface problems are new. The resulting linear systems are solved through an iterative approach exploiting the second-kind nature of the IE operator combined with algebraic multigrid preconditioning for the FE part. Assuming smooth continuations of coefficients and right-hand-side data, we show error analysis supporting high-order accuracy. Numerical evidence further supports our claims of efficiency and high-order accuracy for smooth data. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A simple method is developed to couple accurately translational motion of rigid bodies to compressible fluid flows. Solid rigid bodies are tracked through a Level-Set function. Numerical diffusion is controlled thanks to a compressive limiter (Overbee) in the frame of MUSCL-type-scheme, giving an excellent compromise between accuracy and efficiency on unstructured meshes [9]. The method requires low resolution to preserve solid bodies' volume. Several coupling methods are then addressed to couple rigid body motion to fluid flow dynamics: a method based on stiff relaxation and two methods based on Ghost cells [13] and immersed boundaries. Their accuracy and convergence rates are compared against an immersed piston problem in 1D having exact solution. The second Ghost cell method is shown to be the most efficient. It is then extended to multidimensional computations on unstructured meshes and its accuracy is checked against flow computations around cylindrical bodies. Reference results are obtained when the flow evolves around a rigid body at rest. The same rigid body is then considered with prescribed velocity moving in a flow at rest. Computed results involving wave dynamics match very well. The method is then extended to two-way coupling and illustrated to several examples involving shock wave interaction with solid particles as well as phase transition induced by projectiles motion in liquid-gas mixtures.

AB High-dimensional PDEs have been a longstanding computational challenge. We propose to solve high-dimensional PDEs by approximating the solution with a deep neural network which is trained to satisfy the differential operator, initial condition, and boundary conditions. Our algorithm is meshfree, which is key since meshes become infeasible in higher dimensions. Instead of forming a mesh, the neural network is trained on batches of randomly sampled time and space points. The algorithm is tested on a class of high-dimensional free boundary PDEs, which we are able to accurately solve in up to 200 dimensions. The algorithm is also tested on a high-dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman PDE and Burgers' equation. The deep learning algorithm approximates the general solution to the Burgers' equation for a continuum of different boundary conditions and physical conditions (which can be viewed as a high-dimensional space). We call the algorithm a "Deep Galerkin Method (DGM)" since it is similar in spirit to Galerkin methods, with the solution approximated by a neural network instead of a linear combination of basis functions. In addition, we prove a theorem regarding the approximation power of neural networks for a class of quasilinear parabolic PDEs. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Direct numerical simulation (DNS) of interstitial fluid dynamics in porous media is hindered by the sheer size and complexity of the discretized equations. While reduced-complexity methods such as pore-network models (PNM) can occasionally yield satisfactory solutions at a much lower cost, they can neither estimate nor control their error. We focus on the single-phase Navier-Stokes equations and develop a computationally efficient multiscale method that produces a sequence of increasingly accurate approximations to DNS. The pore-level multiscale method (PLMM) decomposes the pore space into several subdomains and constructs a set of local basis functions on them. The bases are coupled with a global interface problem to obtain an initial approximation to DNS. The approximation is excellent because subdomains coincide with physical pores in the void space and physics-informed boundary conditions are used to construct the bases. Errors in the initial approximation can be arbitrarily reduced with an iterative strategy presented. The method is parallelizable, memory efficient, and allows for different physics, models, and meshes to be incorporated within each subdomain. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Amorphous and heterogeneous amorphous Ni-based alloys have shown promise as electrocatalytic materials for various reactions. The Ni-Nb-Y system is of particular interest due to the immiscibility of Nb and Y that facilitates a heterogeneous amorphous -amorphous or amorphous-nanocrystalline structure. Amorphous alloys in the NiNb-Y system have been previously limited to those produced through rapid solidification processing. In this study, a high energy ball milling process was successfully used for the first time to mechanically alloy novel amorphous-based Ni-Nb-Y alloys. A thermodynamic model of the Ni-Nb-Y alloy system was developed to guide the ternary alloy design while X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy characterized the microstructure of the Ni-Nb-Y alloys. The targeting of high melting Ni-Y and Ni-Nb intermetallic compounds facilitated the amorphization process. A novel amorphous Ni79.2Nb12.5U8.3 alloy was produced after 6 h of cryogenic ball milling. Partial crystallization of the amorphous structure was observed upon prolonged milling with the formation of a secondary nanocrystalline Ni5Y phase in an amorphous matrix. The alloying design strategy shows promise in analogous alloy systems where immiscibility exists among the alloy constituents.

AB During isothermal annealing at temperatures lower than the crystallization onset temperature, T-x, measured during continuous heating, the Al88Y7Fe5 metallic glass undergoes a period of delay time (tau) before the primary crystallization reaction. The delay time is an important parameter, which is closely related with the transport behavior and can be used to calculate the attachment frequency coefficient and steady state nucleation rate. Previously, tau was usually determined from the nanocrystal number density vs. annealing time plot through tedious TEM measurements. Now, a more effective approach to measure tau has been developed by analyzing the T-g shift resulting from annealing with high rate differential scanning calorimetry (FlashDSC). With the increase of annealing time (t(annealing)), T-g shifts to higher temperatures and in the T-g vs. t(annealing) plot, there is a break point in slope. Before this break point, no Al nanocrystals could be detected by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) but after this break point, Al nanocrystals were identified by TEM. Thus, the break point time corresponds to the onset of Al nanocrystal formation and the delay time. The underlying mechanism is unveiled through the matrix composition measurement by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The analysis reveals that before the break point the amorphous matrix composition is unchanged by annealing so that T-g shifts solely due to the increased glass stability through a relaxation process. After the break point, the precipitation of Al nanocrystals induces a composition change in the amorphous matrix so that T-g shifts to higher temperatures because of both the relaxation and the composition change effects.

AB Amorphous glassy polymers are widely used as structural materials. However, their mechanical properties continuously evolve with physical aging, which significantly influences their applications. In this work, we investigate the effects of aging on stress response of poly(ethylene terephthalate)-glycol (PETG). The PETG specimens are either quenched or annealed around or below the glass transition temperature (T-g) for a period of time. The uniaxial compression tests are then performed at T-g-40 degrees C and strain rate 0.001/s. The quenched polymers exhibit the smallest yield strength and strain softening, indicating that negligible structural relaxation occurs for the quenched condition. For annealed polymers, the yield strength increases with aging time. The results also show that there exists an optimal temperature to achieve the highest structural relaxation rate, which is around Tg-20 degrees C. Compared with annealing at a single temperature, annealing at multiple temperatures in discrete steps is a more efficient method for structural relaxation. The same experiments are also performed on specimens with 30% predeformation. The optimal aging temperature does not change with predeformation. However, at the same annealing condition the yield strength of specimens with 30% predeformation is around 5 MPa less than that of undeformed specimens.

AB The release of therapeutic ions during dissolution is necessary for the success of bioactive glasses in medical applications. Therefore, different borate and borosilicate glasses undoped and doped with copper or/and zinc based on the 13-93 composition were tested and compared to the well-known 13-93 bioactive glass in several dissolution media. Prior to dissolution studies, all glasses were characterized using SEM-EDX, FTIR, XRD, DTA and hot stage microscopy (HSM). Dissolution studies were carried out using tris(hydroxymethyparninomethane (TRIS) buffer and simulated body fluid (SBF) under static conditions. The dissolution rates varied following the trend of borate glasses > borosilicate glasses > silicate glasses. Further, the release of boron from both borate and borosilicate glasses was inhibited in SBF compared to TRIS. The dissolution of the glasses was additionally tested in SBF under dynamic conditions to better mimic the human body environment. Under these conditions, Cu-doped glass released up to 10 mg/L of Cu2+, which is the critical biological level of Cu2+ for the survival of fibroblasts. In order to mimic the conditions that may develop locally during the degradation of a poly(lactic acid) (PLA) composite or during a bacterial infection, dissolution studies were for the first time also carried out using a lactic acid solution at pH = 2. Zinc was only released from the Zn-doped glasses under acidic conditions. Owing to the antibacterial property of Zn2+, these results are especially interesting for the application of the ion doped glasses in the treatment or prevention of infections.

AB Bulk glasses of the compositional series (A) xNb(2)O(5)-(50-x)ZnO-50P(2)O(5) and (B) xNb(2)O(5)-50ZnO-(50-x)P2O5 were prepared to investigate possible substitution of cation (Zel), series A, and anion (PO3-), series B, with niobium and the effect of this substitution on the structure, density, molar volume, glass transition temperature and coefficient of thermal expansion. The structure was studied by Raman and P-31 MAS NMR spectroscopies. The chemical model, based on the idea of chemical compounds as components with the lowest Gibbs energy and therefore the most stable, and on the results of P-31 MAS NMR spectroscopy, was proposed for series B. It was found that niobium acts in glasses of series B only as a cation NbO3+, unlike the original idea of forming an anion of NbO-, that is, similarly to series A, where it replaces the cation. This leads to a change in the metaphosphate network of series B to the network that is similar to series A glass. The validity of this idea was verified by experimentally obtained compositional dependencies of molar volume, glass transition temperature and thermal expansion coefficient. Changes observed in thermal measurements indicate the evolution of a more rigid structure and more intensive cross-linking of the phosphate chains with increasing content of niobium.

AB In this study, the effect of crystallization on electrical transport in iron phosphate glass with composition 40Fe(2)O(3)-60P(2)O(5) (mol%) was investigated. This type of glasses exhibits the electronic conduction which is described by polaronic conduction mechanism. Induced and controlled heat-treatment of 40Fe(2)O(3)-60P(2)O(5) glass leads to partially and almost fully crystallized glass-ceramics. The influence of heat-treatment temperature on structural changes, the appearance of crystalline phases, their interactions and influence on electrical transport were studied in details.
   Depending on heat-treatment temperature various phases, such as Fe-3(P2O7)(2), Fe-4(P2O2)(3) and Fe(PO3)(3), embedded in glass matrix, were confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (XRPD) and Raman spectroscopy (RS), whereas thermally induced microstructural changes were evaluated by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM).
   Impact of the structural changes on the electrical properties was explored by means of impedance spectroscopy (IS) in wide frequency and temperature range. DC conductivity decreases in the first stage of the crystallization process and achieves its minimum. With further increase of the heat -treatment temperature, the electrical conductivity rises as a result of an enhanced crystallinity. IS results show the evolution of crystallization and formation of crystalline phases in glassy matrix. Correlation between the shape of the spectra and the nature of the electrical transport was confirmed. Different electrical processes have been identified by detail analysis and contribution of each crystalline phase, glass matrix and grain boundaries to total resistance/conductivity is determined by complex impedance plots by means of equivalent circuit modeling.

AB Many clinical cases show that the failure of root-canal treatment is primarily attributable to remnants of bacteria in root canal systems, especially Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis).
   In this study, silver nanoparticle (AgNP) confined mesoporous structured bioactive powder (M-BP-Ag) was prepared by the evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA) method and evaluated for antibacterial activity against E. faecalis. The composition of the M-BP-Ag belongs to the SiO2-CaO-P2O5 system. The M-BP-Ag was obtained with the composition ratios of Si, Ca, P, and Ag in mole% being (80-X), 15, 5, and X, where X = 0, 1, 5, or 10, respectively. X-ray diffraction (XRD), gas adsorption and desorption analyzer, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to characterize these M-BP-Ag.
   The antibacterial activity of the test samples against E. faecalis was verified by the time-killing curve test and the colony-forming capacity assay. The samples' antibacterial activities depended on the confined AgNP position. From bacterial morphology observation, we also speculated the antibacterial mechanism of the M-BP-Ag test samples in this study.

AB New Ti-based bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) of Ti32.8+xZr30.2-xNi5.3Cu9Be22.7 (3 <= vertical bar X vertical bar <= 15, at.%) with large size were prepared. The results reveal that the forming of primary icosahedral quasicrystal phase (I-phase) and the enthalpy of the primary crystallization (Delta H-1) were closely related to the glass forming abilities (GFAs). Thecrystallization product of the metallic glass alloys at primary crystallization state is a metastable I-phase. It is demonstrated that apparent activation energy for crystallization obtained by fitting the Kissinger equation at T-x temperature increases with the increase of Ti concentration, while GFAs deteriorate. The Delta H-1 of metallic glasses declines with the increase of Ti concentration. The Ti32.8+XZr30.2-XNi5.3Cu9Be22.7 possess high similar compressive fracture strength of about 1800 MPa, which is one of the best options as structural materials on account of high specific strength and low cost.

AB SiO2-Al2O3-CaO-MgO is the most significant slag system in the blast furnace ironmaking process and it is very important to investigate the microstructure and viscosity of the system. In this paper, molecular dynamics simulations were carried out to explore the effects of MgO/Al2O3 ratio on structure and properties of the system. Based on the self-diffusion coefficients, the viscosities were calculated by Einstein-Stokes equation and compared with the experimental value and the Factsage value. The results showed that with the increase of MgO/Al2O3 ratio, the stability of [SiO4](4-) and [AlO4](5-) tetrahedron became weaken and the relative proportions of bridge and non -bridge oxygen showed a decrease. And due to the increase of MgO, more Mg2+ ions are used as network modifiers to reduce the degree of polymerization of the system, resulting in a decrease in the viscosity, which is consistent with experimental results. Finally, based on the present study, in the case of increasing Al2O3 content of blast furnace slag, the fluidity of slag could be adjusted by controlling MgO/Al2O3 ratio, thereby providing a basis for stable operation of blast furnace ironmaking.

AB In this research, the Ag nanoclusters (Ag NCs) dispersed borosilicate glasses with the absence and presence of LiF were prepared by the melt-quenching method. The absorption, photoluminescence, FTIR results indicated that the doping of LiF plays dual effects on the size evaluation of Ag species: the introduction of F- and Li+ can promote and restrain the formation of Ag NCs, respectively. It was also indicated that the promotion effect of F- is overwhelming at lower LiF doping concentration, while the restrain effect of Li+ becomes dominated when increase LiF concentration to 8 mol%. Besides, our research further proved that the formation of Ag NCs is very sensitive to the presence of F content, even the introduction of rare earth ions in the form of fluoride or oxide can obviously modify the amount and size distribution of Ag NCs and thus affect the luminescence properties of the codoped glasses.

AB Bioactive phosphosilicate glasses integrate with bone/tooth tissues by forming a bone-mineral mimicking surface layer of calcium hydroxyapatite (HA). The HA formation ("in vitro bioactivity") in a simulated body fluid (SBF) solution is known to depend both on the P content (rip) and silicate network connectivity ((N) over bar (Si)(BO)) of the glass, but the precise bioactivity composition relationships remain poorly understood. We present a comprehensive study that clarifies the dependence of the in vitro bioactivity on the {n(p), (N) over bar (Si)(BO)} parameters for Na2O-CaO-SiO2-P2O5 glass powders (2.6-6.0 mol% P2O5) exposed to SBF for 24 h, using infrared (IR) and solidstate (31)p, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy in conjunction with measured Ca and P concentrations in the solution. IR-derived relative apatite amounts reveal that an increase in the P content of the pristine glass promotes apatite formation by gradually reducing its dependence on the silicate network polymerization: increasing n(p) widens the (N) over bar (Si)(BO) range that provides a high and nearly constant amount of HA, which scales roughly linearly with n(p); these properties assist future design of P-rich bioactive glasses. All glasses provide significant HA formation for increasing (N) over bar (Si)(BO) values up to approximate to 2.6, above which the in vitro bioactivity is lost due to insufficient glass dissolution. We also discuss the complex dependence of the SBF-testing outcome on the mass concentration and composition of the glass powder, as well as on its particle sizes, highlighting critical concerns that may guide developments of improved in vitro bioactivity-testing protocols. A strong dependence of the HA formation on the particle sizes is observed for glass powders with low P2O5 content (2.6 mol%), as opposed to their P-richer counterparts that reveal no pronounced particle-size effects.

AB Silsesquioxane (SSQ) polymers are important thin film materials in lithography, sensing, opto materials, and low k materials in electronics applications. There is a strong fundamental and practical need to understand the network structure in silsesquioxane films. In this study, two types of SSQ polymer (PSSQ), poly(methylsilsesquixoane) (PMSSQ) and poly(phenylsilsesquioxane) (PPhSSQ), were synthesized and their thin films were examined. Grazing angle reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy (GARAIR) was shown to be a good method to characterize the structure of the SSQ films and quantitative analysis can be done on films of a range of thickness between 7 nm and 150 nm. In particular, the orientation of the Si-O-Si network can be probed with GARAIR due to the polarization effect of the measurement. With increasing film thickness, a decrease in the planarity of the chains (orientation) in the Si-O-Si network was observed and possibly an increasing in the degree of condensation happened as indicated by the red shift of one IR absorption peak in PMSSQ. XRD study shows that both PMSSQ and PPhSSQ films have similar network comprising ladder component. Furthermore, GARAIR established that PPhSSQ shows more isolated silanol content while PMSSQ possesses mostly vicinal silanols.

AB The structures of the Ti75Al25 alloy during rapid-quenching with and without external pressure are investigated by using molecular dynamic techniques. The amorphous phase can be obtained at the cooling rate 10.0 K/ps without pressure. The alloy is composed of crystal and amorphous phase at the cooling rate 0.1 and 1.0 K/ps without pressure, but the pure amorphous phase can be formed when the pressure exceeds the critical value. The critical pressure is about 20 and 30 GPa when the cooling rate is 0.1 and 1.0 K/ps, respectively. H-A indices analysis indicates that high pressure favors the formation of the ideal icosahedral structures in the amorphous Ti75Al25 alloy, and the content of 1551 bond-type can reach near to 50% when the pressure is 30 GPa. The amorphous state can be maintained if the external pressure is removed from the alloy step-by-step. The content of 1551 bond-type decreases with the deceasing of the pressure, but the 1541 and 1431 bond-types increase in this process.

AB The past decade has brought borate glasses to the forefront of industrial and technological innovations with the development of resorbable bioactive glasses for tissue engineering, glasses for immobilization of hazardous wastes and crack-resistant glasses for electronic packaging. However, these applications warrant a deeper understanding of the structural origin of various thermal, chemical and physical properties of borate glasses. Furthermore, the combination of borate glasses with SiO2 results in the formation of borosilicate glasses - one of the most important glass systems from scientific, technological and commercial viewpoints. In fact, it has been shown that most structural features in alkali borosilicates are similar to those of alkali borates. It is therefore important to understand the composition structure property relationships in borate-based glass compositions before extending them to more complex borosilicates, or aluminoborosilicate systems. In particular, aluminoborate glasses are intriguing as composition-structure-property models in these glasses are still under-developed. Accordingly, this paper is a sequel of our previous article [J. Non. Cryst. Solids. 460 (2017) 54-65] where we investigated the molecular structure of glasses in the system 25Na(2)O-xAl(2)O(3)-(75-x)B2O3 (x varies from 0 and 25 mol%) using magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS-NMR) and Raman spectroscopy. Further, the trends observed for the properties of these glasses, for example, density, molar volume, glass transition (T-g), coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) and chemical durability (in water) have been correlated and discussed on the basis of their molecular structure.

AB In this work, we developed a novel inorganic-organic hybrid gate dielectric by combining zirconium and hafnium components to form zirconium hafnium oxide strongly linked with polymethyl methacrylate (ZrHfO2-PMMA) and deposited at low temperature (200 degrees C) by sol-gel method. The obtained 108 nm thick, high-quality hybrid gate dielectric showed an exceptionally low surface roughness (0.9-nm), a low leakage current density (7.7 x 10(-6) A/cm(2)) and reasonable dielectric properties such as gate capacitance along with dielectric constant (77 nF/cm(2) & 9.4 @1 kHz) respectively. To examine the ZrHfO2-PMMA hybrid dielectric electrical properties we constructed thin-film transistors (TFTs) with room temperature r.f sputtered n-type metal oxide semiconductors, a-IGZO and ZnO, as active channels. The bottom gate fabricated a-IGZO TFTs driving at as low as below 6 V, with extracted field effect mobility of 2.45 cm(2)/V. s, a low threshold voltage of 1.2 V with large ON/OFF current ratio 10(7) respectively. On the other hand, for comparison we employed ZnO TFTs by applying same hybrid dielectric system, the obtained parameters of bottom gate ZnO TFTs were good field effect saturation mobility of 12.8 cm(2)/V. s, threshold voltage of 1.8 V and ON/OFF current ratio of 10(3).

AB Glass ceramics from modified molten blast furnace (BF) slag were prepared. The crystallization behavior of the modified BF slag was characterized using differential thermal analysis (DTA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM). The crystallization kinetics results indicated that the crystal. lization activation energy initially decreased and subsequently increased with increasing CaO/SiO2. The crystallization temperature and the crystallization index (n) decreased from 916 to 867 degrees C, and 5.66-1.13, respectively. The crystallization mechanism transformed from bulk crystallization to surface crystallization. By XRD analyzing, Melilite was developed as the main crystal phase, and the transformation of crystal from akermanite to gehlenite was observed. The rapid surface crystallization was beneficial for maintaining the shape of glass ceramics. The complex replacement in melilite crystals resulted in the micro cracks in glass ceramics, therefore led to the decrease of flexural strength of glass ceramics

AB Combeite (Na2Ca2Si3O9) is a mechanically strong phase that crystallizes from 45S5 Bioglass (R) during heat treatments. 4555 glass-ceramics are expected to not only retain desirable levels of bioactivity but also exhibit improved mechanical properties compared to those of the amorphous 45S5 Bioglass (R). However, producing crystalline 45S5 glass-ceramics containing solely combeite is challenging since other phase(s) may also form during the heat treatment process. In this study, we developed a comprehensive set of heat treatment regimes that can be used to control the formation of combeite in order to tailor the crystallinity of 45S5 glass-ceramics over a wide range of 5% to 95%. These heat treatments were designed based on controlling the nucleation and growth temperatures and times of the combeite phase, also preventing other potential phases from forming. The activation energy for crystallization of combeite was calculated based on three different analytical methods and then used to obtain the Avrami exponent of the Bioglass (R) powder (n = 0.71). The results indicated that the crystallization of combeite occurred mainly on the surface of the particles.
   Depending on the target application, different levels of mechanical properties and bioactivity in bioglasses may be required. The crystallinity of 45S5 Bioglass (R) can be adjusted by applying the appropriate heat treatment regime selected from the profiles developed in this study.

AB In this work, an enhanced room-temperature plasticity was achieved in a Zr62.8Cu15Co9.2Ti6Al7 glassy alloy through the application of micro-arc oxidation (MAO) treatment. After treated for 15 and 30 min, the glassy alloy specimen exhibited an enhanced plastic strain of 5.5% and 7.9%, respectively. Both the introduction of nucleation sites for shear band at the coating/substrate interface owing to stress concentration and the physical constraint effect for the propagating shear bands from the in-situ formed coating are responsible for the enhanced plasticity. This finding may open a new avenue for developing ductile metallic glasses from a surface modification aspect.

ID ALUMINOSILICATE GLASSES; FLUORESCENCE PROPERTIES; DY3+; SAMARIUM
AB A large variety of more than sixty Sm3+ doped alumino silicate glass compositions were investigated for their luminescence properties in dependence of their chemical composition. To do so, mainly metaluminous and peralkaline alumino silicate glasses with the network modifiers lithium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium, yttrium, lanthanum, zinc, and lead were prepared. For some compositions also the effect of fluoride addition, the Al2O3/SiO2 ratio and the substitution of Al2O3 for B2O3 was investigated. A constant Sm3+ doping concentration of 1 x 1020 Sm3+/cm(3) was used, which corresponds to about 0.22 mol% Sm2O3.
   Due to the large quantity of samples, a systematic compositional effect on the Sm3+ emission spectra could be observed: The intensity ratio of the emission peaks at 600 nm and 645 nm is decreased for network modifying ions of larger ionic radii, lower electric field strengths and for higher network modifier concentrations in the glass composition. For exceptionally low network modifier field strengths and concentrations, the emission peak at 645 nm is even stronger than the peak at 600 nm resulting in a more reddish Sm3+ emission in these glasses. The Sm3+ luminescence lifetimes generally decrease with increasing atomic weight, density and refractive index of the glasses. However, peralkaline sodium, potassium, strontium and barium alumino silicate glasses show notably higher luminescence lifetimes than other glass compositions of similar atomic weight. The lifetimes of these glasses are up to 80% higher than their respective metaluminous compositions.

AB We report the influence of silver (Ag) and titania (TiO2) nanoparticles (ATNPs) co-embedment on the photo-luminescence (PL) properties of dysprosium ions (Dy3+) doped zinc-magnesium tellurite glass system prepared using conventional melt quenching method. Both up- and down-converted PL spectra of glasses revealed three emission bands located at 482 (blue: F-4(9/2)-> H-6(15/2)), 574 (yellow: F-4(9/2)-> H-6(13/2)) and 664 nm (weak red: F-4(9/2)-> H-6(11/2)), where the band intensities were enhanced with the inclusion of ATNPs. Glasses with 0.2 mol% of ANPs and up to 0.3 mol% of TNPs disclosed highest PL intensity enhancement, which was majorly attributed to the ATNPs mediated localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) and large field enhancement (called hot spot) effects in the proximity of Dy3+ ions. Absorption spectra of glasses displayed two plasmon bands characteristics of each type of nanoparticle. It was inferred that the superposition of localized SP modes from ATNPs could generate new hybridized modes (strong local field in the vicinity of Dy3+ ions) shifted with respect to the single type of NPs resonance. HRTEM images showed the existence of both Ag and titania NPs inside the glass matrix. Glasses containing ATNPs exhibited anatase phase with (103) and (112) nanocrystalline lattice plane orientation. Proposed glass system may be useful for the development of solid state laser and photonic devices.

AB Magnesium-based thin film metallic glass (MgMG) has recently pulled in huge attraction for biomedical implants because of their promising biocompatibility, biodegradability, and better, mechanical properties. In this study, biodegradable polycaprolactone (PCL) and nano-hydroxyapatite (nHA) are electrospun at various PCL/nHA concentration and used as scaffolds. Mg-Zn-Ca thin film metallic glasses were sputtered over the scaffold by DC magnetron sputtering process to obtain surface modified scaffolds of (PCL/MgMG) and (PCL/nHA/MgMG). Magnesium metallic glass coatings neither alter the structure of the scaffold or the rate of magnesium release nor weight loss, compared with the uncoated scaffold. The changes within the crystallinity, wettability, and oxygen content of sputtered coating not solely improve the mechanical adhesion strength; however additionally increase the biological response with controlled biodegradation. Moreover, the modified specimen prompt higher hemocompatibility, due to the change in wettability from 127 to 48 degrees and due to C-O to C=O functional group ratio. These promising outcomes uncover the clinical potential of the surface modified coating of magnesium metallic glass on PCL and PCL/nHA scaffolds as degradable implants.

AB The analysis of iron, manganese and antimony in silicate glass is of great interest in chemistry, materials science, earth sciences and archaeological sciences. Yet, conclusions from different fields appear to be contradictory and many questions about redox reactions in glass remain. The purpose of this study is thus to discuss whether and how these multivalent elements interact in glass. Soda-lime silicate melts containing iron along with manganese and/or antimony have been analysed at different high temperatures under argon atmosphere. Using in-situ XANES at the Fe K-edge, redox thermodynamics, kinetics and diffusivities have been assessed for the different compositions. The data obtained show that antimony is more efficient at oxidising iron compared to manganese at all temperatures. The oxidising power trend would thus be Sb > Sb + Mn > Mn. Furthermore, hypotheses on the formation of Fe-Mn complexes are also reported in glasses with stoichiometric proportions of iron and manganese. Based on the determination of redox diffusivities, it appears that presence of other multivalent elements does not significantly affect the iron redox mechanisms and that diffusivity is essentially controlled by the mobility of calcium.

ID METAKAOLIN
AB This work evaluates the properties of geopolymer-composites based on blast furnace slag with additions of a carbon fiber waste coming from the aircraft industry. Two parameters were considered: slag/waste ratio (100/0, 80/20 and 60/40) and nature of activating solution (8 M NaOH and sodium silicate). Open porosity and compressive strength were analysed. Geopolymers were also subjected to a sulphuric attack and thermal resistance test (compressive strength after 105, 300, 500 and 700 degrees C was assessed). Porosities increased and compressive strengths decreased as the slag was replaced by the carbon fiber waste. A positive effect of the carbon fiber waste on the acid attack was observed mainly due to the created porosity which could generate space to calcium-sulphate products precipitation. CFW incorporation improved the thermal resistance since higher porosity could provide channel to increase heat dissipation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A new AZ91/TiNi composite has been developed in the present study. The composite containing 20% (vol.) TiNi reinforcement micro-particles was produced by hot pressing of initial prealloyed AZ91D and Ti49.2Ni50.8 powders at 420 degrees C for 1 h. Microstructural analysis revealed that matrix and reinforcement phases did not react each other during processing and a good bonding which is free from porosity, oxide and carbides was attained. Ti49.2Ni50.8 reinforcement increased room temperature yield strength, compressive strength and ductility of AZ91D alloy 5%, 50% and 30%, respectively. Most importantly, yield strength of the composite at 100 degrees C was found to be 267 MPa, 50% higher than that of AZ91D alloy (176 MPa) due to stress-induced martensitic transformation observed in the reinforcing alloy.

AB Scanning electron microscopy, electric field-current density measurements, capacitance-voltage testing, X-ray diffraction analysis, and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy were performed to study the effects of rare earth-yttrium and gallium doping on the microstructure and electrical properties of ZnO varistors. Our results indicated that the introduction of gallium and yttrium strengthened the barrier height of grain boundaries and led to a decrease in the grain resistance. Both the voltage gradient and nonlinear coefficient of the samples increased and then decreased as the gallium doping level was increased at a given rare earth-yttrium. The residual voltage ratio and the leakage current varied with the opposite relationship.

AB Developing bioinks for 3D bioprinting that are easy to print and highly biocompatible is essential for the growth of the tissue engineering field. Here, a gelatin methacryloyl-based (GelMA) bioink that is loaded with aminolyzed poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) microcylinders is developed. The bioink showed better printing capabilities compared to pure GelMA, which exhibited a smaller window of high quality printability. The addition of microcylinders makes the bioink more forgiving to print by increasing its minimum viscosity while keeping its structural integrity after printing. Cell viability of printed constructs was compared to non-printed constructs to see the effects of shear stress in the new bioink. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A novel process to fabricate titanium metal by a molten salt electrochemical deoxidization method has attracted significant interest worldwide, in which TiO2 as the cathode is directly reduced to metal titanium. However, the titanium sub-oxide, Ti4O7, has never been used for obtaining titanium metal, although it offers some advantages over TiO2 especially high electric conductivity. In this study, Ti4O7 was employed to successfully fabricate the pure titanium metal for the first time through this process. The results showed that sponge-type titanium metal could be obtained after 23 h of electrochemical reduction at 900 degrees C. And the particles size slightly increased to similar to 3-6 mu m in diameter compared with Ti4O7 (2-5 mu m) according to the scanning electron microscopy. The intermediate process with various reaction time was also studied, showing that there were some sequent intermediate products such as CaTiO3 and CaTi2O4 produced during the transition of Ti4O7 to Ti. This paper provides a fancy idea to realize the fabrication of titanium metal through a low-cost and relatively high-efficiency process. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The trivalent dysprosium ions occupy two crystallographically nonequivalent sites (4a) and (4c) with the C-i and C-s symmetry, respectively. Raman spectroscopy corroborates the crystal structure features of orthorhombic Dy3+-doped Ca2GeO4 with the maximum phonon energy of 760 cm(-1).

AB In this work, novel nanoplate-like Sn-Zn-O thin films were prepared by a sol-gel method and the effect of thermal treatment on the component and morphology was investigated. The photocatalytic activity was evaluated by photodegradation of Methylene blue. The results of X-ray diffraction show that the as-grown sample is a mixture of crystalline zinc hydroxystannate (ZnSn(OH)(6)) and amorphous ZnO; ZnSn(OH)(6) is preferentially oriented along the (2 0 0) plane and has a platy morphology. With the increase of heating temperature, the compact and smooth nanoplates evolve into porous nanoplates, and the ZnSn(OH)(6) is transformed into zinc metastannate (ZnSnO3), and the crystallinity of ZnO is gradually improved. For the heat-treated samples, the optical absorption spectra display two absorption edges corresponding to ZnO and ZnSnO3. The photocatalytic performance of Sn-Zn-O films is much higher than that of pure ZnO films and it shows good reproducibility. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this research, we report a reusable multifunctional electrode, which can not only be used for supercapacitors, but can also act as the anode material for the degradation of bisphenol A (BPA) by the advanced electrochemical oxidization technology. This multifunctional electrode was prepared by growing MnO2 nanoflakes directly on a Ni foam substrate using a facile hydrothermal method. When substituted for the electrode in a supercapacitors, the specific capacitance was 846.1F/g at 5 mV/s. Furthermore, when used as anode material for degradation BPA in the advanced electrochemical oxidization process. The BPA removal rate is 99.7%, and this rate can be maintained at about 85.6% after 5 cycles. It is hoped that this electrode will provide new opportunities for the cooperation of energy and the environment in the future. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The unique structure made up of nanoneedles endows high electrical conductivity and large accessible ion-diffusion surface area. When used as the electrode, the P-doped MnCo2S4 nanostructures give an improved specific capacity of 543.3F g(-1). A supercapacitor employing the P-MnCo2S4 and active carbon as the electrodes shows a high energy density of 20.8 W h kg(-1) at a power density of 400 W kg(-1), and an excellent cycling stability of 91.1% retention after 5000 cycles.

AB We report the crystallization of electrodeposited BiVO4 photoanode by deploying conventional furnace annealing and hybrid microwave annealing, with the latter proving to possess higher crystallinity, charge carrier mobility, light absorption and conduction band level. The crystallization of BiVO4 was improved by microwave annealing, yielding higher charge carrier density. Higher morphological compactness and crystallinity for microwave annealed sample enhanced its light absorption properties. The smaller crystallite sizes upon microwave annealing resulted in band gap augmentation due to quantum confinement effect and manifested itself in its more elevated conduction band. The enhanced intrinsic properties of BiVO4 increased photoelectrochemical performance of microwave annealed sample by approximately two times compared with that of furnace annealed sample. The ultrafast synthesis as well as the possibilities of morphological, optical and electronics tunability motivates further research into devices and photoelectrodes based on microwave-annealed BiVO4.

TI Dual-cluster interpretation of binary eutectics associated with
   hexagonal close-packed solid solution phases
SO MATERIALS LETTERS

AB Eutectic compositions have been previously solved by a dual-cluster model which regards the eutectic liquid as two structural units issued from the relevant eutectic phases. However, this rule is not generally obeyed in eutectics involving elemental solid solutions. The present paper addresses the composition interpretation of binary eutectics in Al-Co, Co-Cr, Mg-Hg, and Mg-Sb systems, which are characterized by nearly equal atomic radii of the two elements and by the involvement of one eutectic phase with hexagonal close-packed structure. The universal cluster formula for hexagonal close-packed solid solutions is calculated following the cluster-plus-glue-atom model, in which any short-range-order structure is described by a structural unit composed of a nearest-neighbor cluster (twinned cuboctahedron for hexagonal close-packed phase) plus a few next-neighbor glue atoms. According to our calculations, for solutes and solvents in the similar size, which is the present case, the number of glue atoms is 3 for hexagonal close-packed solid solutions, formulated as [twinned cuboctahedron](glue atom)(3). Thus, the dual-cluster formulas for the related eutectic points are established: two clusters from the relevant eutectic phases plus 4 or 6 glue atoms (the number of glue atoms is 1 or 3 for the other eutectic phase), well matching the experimentally measured eutectic compositions.

AB Co3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared via a facile coprecipitation method. The carbon monoxide (CO) sensitivity of the as-prepared material was studied at different temperature (50-200 degrees C) and at different gas concentration (5-1500 ppm). In order to improve the sensor sensitivity, silver (Ag) NPs were loaded on Co3O4 nanoparticles through solution impregnation technique. The crystalline structure, thickness, morphology and elemental composition of the sensing films were characterized by XRD, FE-SEM and EDX analysis. Our results indicated that Ag NPs addition has increased the sensitivity of the Co3O4 NPs based CO sensor. Improving effect of Ag was discussed through activation energy evaluation and energy band diagram. It was concluded that Ag NPs addition, has facilitated CO sensing by decreasing the activation energy and also through the electronic mechanism in the energy levels of Ag-Co3O4 heterocontact.

AB Chitosan/graphene oxide composites (CGs) were developed using directional freezing to create aligned porous three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds resembling bone lamellae. The contact provided by the anisotropic scaffolds played a critical role in guiding the alignment of MC3T3-E1 cells along the longitudinal direction. The higher mechanical strength, shape-memory, cell alignment guiding capabilities, and protein adsorption ability, render these composites potentially useful as scaffold materials in bone tissue engineering.

AB In this work, we prepared BiCuSeO polycrystalline films by evaporating precursors following with selenization treatment. Their optical and photoelectrical properties were investigated from visible to infrared light. Optical absorption spectrum indicated that the absorption coefficient was 10(4)-10(5) cm(-1) from 0.4 mu m to 2 mu m. Photo induced voltages were clearly detected when the film surfaces were irradiated by the lasers with various wavelengths and powers. The voltage had a linear dependence with the laser illumination intensity, which indicated the main response mechanism of photo-thermal electric effect in the films. All the results suggested that the BiCuSeO film was a potential material for near infrared detector application. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The obtained photocatalysts were characterized by XRD, SEM, EDS, EDS, PL and UV-vis, respectively. It can be observed that the new photocatalyst made from Bi2O3 modified by 4-Bromothiophenol exhibited a fiber-shaped structure, and its crystalline phase didn't change by adding 4-Bromothiophenol, but its photocatalytic property was tremendously improved. The highly photocatalytic activity of this novel photocatalyst was tested by degradation of malachite green (MG) with its initial concentration of 35 mg L-1, and the result showed that the MG degradation rate up to 99.4% after irradiation for 80 min.

AB Surface modification of aramid fiber to improve its interfacial adhesion with epoxy resin is always a meaningful topic. Herein, a layer of coordination polymer (CP) was introduced on aramid fiber surface via chemical grafting, and the thickness of CP layer could be controlled by reaction time. The experimental results showed that CP layer with a thickness of 40 nm to 60 nm is optimal for fiber's interfacial properties. Also, it is found that this CP layer could be degraded by HCl, making the fiber recyclable in fiber/resin composite with typical fabrication techniques. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The microstructure, mechanical behaviors and toughening mechanisms were investigated in details by SEM, XRD, TEM and Nano-indentation. It is found that the stress-induced martensitic transformation from beta to alpha '' phase and the mechanical twinning in the alpha '' phase combined to account for these mechanical behaviors. The current work offers a new perspective for developing in situ dendrite reinforced BMGCs with improved homogeneous ductility and significant work-hardening capacity. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB In the present work, the effect mechanisms of the sulfurization temperature on the Cu2MnSnS4 (CMTS) absorbers and the photovoltaic characteristics of devices were studied systematically. The results indicate that an increase in sulfurization temperature form 500 degrees C to 560 degrees C significantly improves the crystallinity and morphology, lowers the band gap of the CMTS absorbers, and eventually enhances the photovoltaic performance. However, a further increase in the temperature to 590 degrees C degrades the crystallinity and morphology. By tuning sulfurization temperature, the short current density (J(sc)) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) increase over fourfold. When the temperature optimized to 560 degrees C, the CMTS solar cell shows the highest PCE of 0.91% with J(sc) = 7.71 mA.cm(-2), V-oc = 320 mV and FF = 37%. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Secondary flexible zinc-nickel battery was fabricated with the polyvinyl acetate (PVA) gel-polymer electrolyte which containing the black phosphorus (BP). And for the first time, the three electrode system was introduced in the electrochemical analysis for quasi-solid flexible zinc-nickel battery. The BP modified polymer electrolyte has an interpenetrating network structure where PVA works as polymer matrix and BP as Zn(OH)(4)(2) barrier. With the three electrode cell system, tests of Tafel and charge-discharge for the flexible zinc anodes were carried. The results show that the BP in the electrolyte membrane can suppress zinc corrosion and hydrogen evolution reaction. The BP@PVA polymer electrolyte significantly improved the specific discharge capacity and cycle performance of the battery. The flexible zinc-nickel battery with PVA@BP electrolyte shows the high initial discharge capacity of 509.8 mA h g(-1) and retains 212.8 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Compared with traditional preparation methods to fabricate aluminum foams, additive manufacturing technology have some advantages such as the ability to prepare complex shapes and relatively high processing efficiency. In this paper, laser melting deposition (LMD) process has been used to additive manufacture aluminum alloy foams (AAFs). During LMD process, Ni-coated TiH2 was used as the foaming agent. AAFs with different porosity and pore-size have been manufactured by LMD process. The pore size and porosity of AAFs are increasing with increasing addition of Ni-TiH2. The sound insulation measurement results indicate that porosity and pore-size have influence on sound-insulated capability. With pore size and porosity increasing, sound-insulated capability of AAFs show a trend of decreasing at first and increasing later. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID DESIGN
AB The high-entropy alloy based self-lubricating composites were successfully synthesised by mechanical alloying (MA) and spark plasma sintering (SPS). In this paper, Fe50Mn30Co10Cr10 was chosen as matrix and graphene nanoplatelets were chosen as solid lubricant dispersed phase. The results showed that the matrix maintains a single FCC structure before or after the solid lubricants added. The tribological properties of the composites were better than the matrix. In room temperature, the coefficients of friction (COF) of composites were 62% lower than the Fe50Mn30Co10Cr10. In the meantime, the wear loss can hardly be detected by the device. The results are discussed in terms of mechanisms controlling the lubrication process in composites with matrix. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, we have studied the effects of temperature and atomic disorder on the magnetic phase transitions in ZnO nanoparticles obtained by sol-gel method. The samples were sintered at temperatures of 600 degrees C, 800 degrees C 1000 degrees C and 1200 degrees C for 2 h. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis have shown a single phase, belonging to the hexagonal structure of ZnO and the Rietveld refinement showed an increase in the lattice parameters a and c with increasing sintering temperature. The crystallite mean size (D) increases from 61 nm to 70 nm, while the lattices strain decreases from 0.181% to 0.169% when the sintering temperature varies from 600 degrees C to 1200 degrees C. The magnetic measurements at 300 K, exhibit a ferromagnetic contribution in combination with a paramagnetic component for samples obtained at 600 degrees C, 800 degrees C and 1000 degrees C. A magnetic transition was verified for the sample obtained at 1200 degrees C, now with diamagnetic behavior. The sol-gel method is presented as an alternative to study the evolution of the different magnetic phases as a function of the degree of atomic disorder in ZnO nanoparticles. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

ID LIGHT-EMITTING-DIODES; DEVICES
AB Numerous efforts have been devoted to improve the device efficiency of phosphorescent organic lightemitting diodes (PhOLEDs), however, strategies to suppress the device efficiency roll-off are still in urgent need. Here, a general and effective approach to boost the efficiency and suppress the efficiency roll-off of PhOLEDs is proposed, that is, utilizing TADF material with high triplet energy (ET) as the host for blue, orange and red phosphorescent dopants is proposed. In this work, we investigate the performance of these PhOLEDs based a new TADF host phenylbis(4-(3,3 '',6,6 ''-tetra-tert-butyl-9'H-[9,3':6',9 ''-tercarbazol]-9'-yl)phenyl)phosphineoxide (TPPOCz). The blue device based on the TPPOCz host exhibit efficiencies of 43.6 cd A(-1) and 20.4%, and small efficiency roll-off of 2.1% and 2.9% for CE and EQE from the peak efficiencies to these at 1000 cd m(-2). We compared the performances with that reported in literature, and confirmed these devices in this work are among the best of PhOLEDs. These results can be ascribed to the rapid reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process and high triplet energy (E-T). These excellent performances indicating the potential of TADF host for the realization of highly efficient and stable devices in future. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID NANOTUBE MEMBRANES; ARRAYS; FABRICATION
AB Free-standing titanium dioxide (TiO2) membranes with highly ordered, vertically aligned nanotube arrays were fabricated by using two step anodization of pure titanium (Ti) foil in fluorine containing ethylene glycol. TiO2 nanotubes were prepared under anodizing voltage of 50 V on Ti foil, followed by a thermal annealing at temperature of 200 degrees C for 10 min, and 450 degrees C for 2 h, respectively. Subsequently, anodization was carried out at high voltage of 70 V which directly induced detachment of the nanotube membranes from Ti substrate. The film with high-quality surface and open-ended tubes could be obtained, which was easily peeled off and transferred onto other substrates. Free-standing TiO2 membranes were characterized by field emission scanning electron microcopy (FE-SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-vis spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). As a result, we found that the diameter increased while tube length decreased with increasing concentration of DI water. Additionally, the thickness of film increased with increasing anodization time. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Carbon-coated cobalt sulfide@reduced graphene oxide (CoS@rGO@C) composite was innovatively synthesized by a simple solvothermal reaction and subsequent carbon coating process for use as the anode material in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). In this composite structure, the rGO network and extra outer carbon coating worked synergically to achieve excellent electrode architecture stability upon long-term cycling. Specifically, the CoS@rGO@C composite anode demonstrated superior reversible capacity (706 mAh.g(-1) at 100 mA.g(-1) at the 1st cycle), high rate capability (374 mAh.g(-1) at 1.6 A.g(-1)), and remarkably stable cycling performance (80% capacity preservation for up to 100 cycles) based on the synergistic action of rGO and carbon coating on CoS. In addition to improving the electrochemical performance of CoS anodes, this composite material strategy can be conveniently adapted to other metal-based anode designs to improve their cycling stability and promote their application in energy storage.

AB The conditions needed to design gum metal were reconsidered based on the equivalent beta stabilizer content required to obtain compositional/microstructural variability in a Ti-24(Nb + Ta + V)-(Zr, Hf)-O system. It was found that 90% cold-worked Ti-23Nb-1Ta-2Hf-O alloy exhibits gum-metal-like superproperties such as ultrahigh strength, ultralow elastic modulus, superelasticity, superplasticity, and Elinvar behavior. These multi-functions can be achieved even with the deformation-induced x phase if nanodomains and giant faults exist. This suggests that not only the three electronic magic numbers, but also the equivalent b stabilizer content should be considered to attain the superproperties. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Micro-nano structure of Cu2O/CuO composite array and CuO nanowire array on nanoporous Cu are successfully synthesized via anodic oxidation method. Nanoporous Cu with bicontinuous network was fabricated by chemical dealloying. The CuxO/NP-Cu (x = 1 and 2) composites can be used as supported electrode for supercapacitor. The specific capacitance of nanowires CuO/NP-Cu electrode is 143.63 F g(-1) at a current density of 0.5 mA cm(-2), which is better than CuO/Cu2O/NP-Cu and NP-Cu electrodes. This can be attributed to the synergistic effect of NP-Cu structure with large internal surface and the morphology of CuO nanowire, which are favorable for electron transfer and enhancement of chargedischarge rate.

It is noteworthy that these BiOCl nanosheets exhibit distinctly superior photoactivity for Rhodamine B (RhB) degradation under visible light irradiation over their counterparts synthesized by solvothermal methods. Mechanistic study revealed that the abundant O-2(.) species on BiOCl nanosheets are responsible for the high activity. The simplicity of the presenting strategy contributes to the construction of efficient photocatalysts and might motivate people to rethink the underlying chemistry in traditional construction strategies.

AB Flower-like silver nanoparticles (F-AgNPs) are facilely synthesized with two-step wet-chemical method. In the first step, ho leaf extracts reduce AgNO3 to form spherical AgNPs. In the second step, F-AgNPs are synthesized from spherical particles. The effect of gum arabic and HNO3 on morphology of F-AgNPs is intensively investigated. The reduction and oxidation provide a trade-off between aggregation and detachment of Ag atoms on the surface, while the structure-directing agent boosts preferential growth, contributing to formation of F-AgNPs with different shapes. Our results pave an alternative way for synthesizing AgNPs with specific shapes and advancing applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Novel multiferroic composites of 0.95Na(0.52)K(0.48)NbO(3)-0.05LaTiO(3) (KNN-LT) as ferroelectric matrix and 20 vol% Ni0.2Zn0.3Co0.5Fe2O4 (NZCFO) as ferromagnetic reinforcement successfully prepared by a conventional sintering process. In X-ray spectra, both the characteristics peaks of ferroelectric KNN-LT and ferromagnetic NZCFO phases without any impurity phase were clearly observed. Both in pure ferroelectric and composite samples the orthorhombic symmetry of KNN based piezoceramic was detected. In FESEM images, the characteristic cube-like morphology of KNN-LT phase and regular polygonal grains of NZCFO ferrite indicates the successful sintering process of multiferroic composites. The simultaneous ferroelectric (based on P-E loop) and ferromagnetic (according to M-H curve) behaviors of KNN-LT/NZCFO approves that this composite can be known as a novel lead free multiferroic composite. The excellent values of Ps similar to 9 mu C/cm(2) and Ms similar to 14 emu/g for this magnetoelectric composite were obtained. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

ID MAGNETIC-PROPERTIES; NANOPARTICLES; GROWTH
AB Fe-N film on semi-insulated GaN is fabricated through nitridation of Fe film. There coexist a variety of phases of iron nitrides in the film, which are confirmed by structure analysis and surface morphology. It is found that the sample exhibits room-temperature ferromagnetism and its Curie temperature should be lower than that of Fe film. Finally, the electrical measurement shows that the film is a conductor, whose resistivity is about 2.2 times higher than that of Fe film. This work indicates that the present method can be used to fabricate iron nitrides with discretional ratio of Fe: N (more than 1) on GaN (0001) template, which is a fascinating topic of iron nitrides in the future.

AB A novel coaxial double-layer-coated multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNTs) was synthesized to obtain excellent electromagnetic-wave-absorbing materials. Hydrochloric-acid-doped polyaniline (PANI) served as the first shell via in situ redox polymerization using FeCl3 as the oxidizing agent. The introduction of PANI effectively solved the problem in which ferroferric oxide (Fe3O4)-coated carbon nanotubes had poor integrity and easily fell off in the previous experiment. After the reaction, the oxidizing agent directly provided Fe3+ and Fe2+ ions for the second Fe3O4 shell, which was deposited on the surface of hydrochloric-acid-doped PANI interlayer via coprecipitation. The hybrid fully combined MWCNTs with prominent dielectric properties and Fe3O4 with outstanding magnetic properties and showed excellent electromagnetic wave absorption performance with high reflection loss (- 15.65 dB at 15.45 GHz) and broad effective bandwidth (<--10 dB) of 3.5 GHz (14-17.5 GHz) at lowest thickness (1.5 mm).

DE Spider web; Silk; Fibers; Contact angle; Electrospinning; Roughness
AB In this study, we showed a simple approach to biomimic the wetting properties of spider webs, which can be mainly attributed to the geometry of fibers. We created biomimetic fibers using electrospun polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) with a wrinkled surface similar to the morphology of spider silk bundles produced by Linothele megatheloides. Without any chemical modification and copying the silk bundles geometry, we successfully translated the similar hydrophobic properties to an electrospun network of fibers. The novelty of this approach lays in obtaining similar macroscale roughness parameters, responsible here for wetting contact angles, due to the substitution of spider silk bundles with individual wrinkled electrospun fibers. The presented methods open new creative solutions for manufacturing anti-wetting surfaces. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The tremelliform Co3O4@CeO2 hybrid electrode delivers ultrahigh specific capacitance of 2260.8 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1). The porous network structure with large specific surface area facilitates electron transfer and electrolyte diffusion. In addition, highly activity CeO2 can accelerate faradaic reaction and increase the oxidation degree of Co3O4, which results in excellent cyclic stability.

Importantly, benefiting from interconnected pore structure and abundant polar functional groups of polyimide macromolecule, the diffusion and loss of intermediate polysulfides in electrolyte can be suppressed from physical and strong chemical adsorption and interaction. In cycle testing, the capacity fade rate is only 0.08% per cycle and the discharge capacity remains 680 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles at 0.5 C, which indicates the special hot-pressed electrospun PI separators have a good cycle stability and a broad application prospect in lithium-sulfur batteries.

AB In this research, silver-embedded silicon@silica (Si/Ag@SiOx) was successfully fabricated. The Ag nanoparticles were deposited on the surface of Si-core particles by self-selective electroless deposition, then SiOx-shell was generated by wet oxidation in a sealed Teflon-lined autoclave. With the aid of embedded-Ag nanoparticles, the powder resistivity of Si/Ag@SiOx is only 0.747 k Omega.cm, which is nearly 3.42 x 104 times lower than that of silicon@silica (Si@SiOx). Benefiting from the double effects of SiOx-shell (mechanical buffering) and embedded-Ag (high electric conductivity), Si/Ag@SiOx presents excellent electrochemical performance as anode material for lithium ion batteries. The discharge capacity of Si/Ag@SiOx is up to 1453.2 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles. Besides, Si/Ag@SiOx holds 334.8 mAh g(-1) higher capacity than Si@SiOx at current density of 8.4 A g(-1) (2 C), which is attributed to rapid electron transport brought by the embedded-Ag nanoparticles.

AB The organic crystals with abundance of donor-acceptor moieties readily facilitate the mechanism of charge transfer which aids for grooming the nonlinear optical (NLO) effects and hence core investigation on glycine crystal is deliberately needed for visualizing its compatibility for frequency conversion device applications. In this communication the gamma glycine (GG) crystal has been firstly grown in presence of salicylic acid and priority is given to explore its optical properties. The structural parameters and space group of GG crystal has been confirmed by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. The qualitative analysis of GG crystal has been performed by means of fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The color centered luminescence emission profile of GG crystal has been assessed by means of photoluminescence study. The UV-visible spectral analysis has been employed within 200-1100 nm to examine the optical transparency of GG crystal. The linear optical parameters of GG crystal has been evaluated using the transmittance data. The large enhancement in second harmonic generation (SHG) efficiency of GG crystal with reference to KDP and ADP crystal has been confirmed by Kurtz-Perry test. The competency of GG crystal for NLO device application has been proposed in vision of obtained results. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB It has been challenging to achieve good strength-ductility synergy in titanium metal matrix composites (Ti-MMCs). Herein we report a new Ti-MMC produced by multi-directional forging (MDF) undertaken in near beta phase region. The developed composite exhibits a microstructure featuring dynamically recrystal-lized (DRX) ultrafine alpha-Ti matrix with uniformly dispersed micrometer sized TiB whiskers and submicrometer sized Y2O3 particles. This unique microstructure renders the composite an exceptionally high strength and good ductility at room temperature. The strengthening mechanism of the dually reinforced Ti composite is discussed.

AB During this process, the phosphorus atom is engineered into hollow molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) in virtue of a facile and simple hydrothermal synthesis. The hollow flake-like phosphorus-doped MoS2 (MoSP) materials are reported firstly for the electrolytic hydrogen production. The MoSP exhibits stronger excellent electrocatalytic activity than pure MoS2 with a lower onset potential about 31 mV and a smaller Tafel slope about 45 mV per decade due to the enhanced electrical conductivity. Also, the MoSP catalyst shows a good stability. The better electrocatalytic activity is relative with the special flake-like structure and the synergy of S and P double anions relying on the doping of low-electronegative P atoms.

AB The low-temperature selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx by ammonia is an efficient purification technique to eliminate NOx from stationary combustion sources. In this paper, the different exposed crystal facets of alpha-MnO2 catalyst were controllably synthesized by using of capping agents of PVP, P123, HAc and CTAB. It was found that all alpha-MnO2 catalyst prepared using various capping agents are with the same nanorods morphology but different exposed crystal facets. The structure-activity relationship of the catalyst was investigated and the exposed crystal facets showed strong effects of on its activity of SCR for deNO(x). The alpha-MnO2 catalyst with exposed (2 0 0) facets has the highest surface acidity, strongest NH3 and NO adsorption and therefore the best low-temperature SCR activity, with 98% NO conversion at 160 degrees C.

We have found that three types of atomic clusters exist as basic structural units: star, flattened hexagon and decagon with an edge-length of 0.65 nm. These three types of units are linked to each other by sharing edges or inter-penetrating, with adjacent star clusters overlapping each other. The respective structural models of these structural units are proposed from the HAADF STEM images. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

X-ray diffraction patterns of the samples showed the formation of cubic structure. No evidence of secondary phase was found within the detection limit of XRD facility which was in agreement with the Raman spectra of all the samples. Temperature dependence of relative permittivity and dielectric loss for the sample with x = 0.10 showed a temperature stable relative permittivity of similar to 840 +/- 15% over the temperature range -62 to 192 degrees C and dielectric losses <0.02 in a wide temperature range (-28 to 374 degrees C). The wide temperature stable dielectric properties of x = 0.10 sample suggest that it could be a promising candidate material for X8R/X9R type capacitors. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However studies for anti-icing or de-icing coatings on concrete are still rare due to the special features of concrete surfaces. Here superhydrophobic coating was performed on concrete via spray method and the icephobicity was studied experimentally and theoretically. The low ice adhesive strength and good durability of sprayed coatings represent the potential for icephobic concrete and our theoretical model provides effective route for the design of icephobic concrete.

AB The present study proposes a novel approach to rolling in order to achieve further microstructure modification and mechanical properties improvement of already severely deformed materials. Commercially pure aluminium was subjected to the combined, two stages, heavy strain processes. First, samples were deformed using multi-turn equal channel angular pressing. Five passes of two-turn channel resulted in high strain level, which equaled 11.5. After such a deformation, the microstructure consists of ultrafine grained structure with the fraction of high angle grain boundaries equaled 61%. Then, the second plastic forming process was applied i.e. multi rotational flat rolling. Proposed multipass rolling is based on maintaining a square cross-section of the workpiece. Rolling of severely deformed sample with the thickness reduction of 25% resulted in the improvement in mechanical strength about 15%. It is caused by the increased fraction of high angle grain boundaries up to 75%, while differences in average grain/subgrain size between samples are insignificant. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB A novel flame retardant film of agar/sodium alginate/boric acid (AG/SA/BA) was prepared in presence of various concentration of BA (2.5, 5, 10, 15 wt%) through solution casting method. The result showed that C-O-B bonds were formed between BA and matrix. The addition of BA enhanced the limiting oxygen index (LOI), which might be related to the interaction formed between BA and matrix and excessive BA existing in molecular skeleton. The thermal stability of crosslinking film containing BA concentration above 5 wt% was improved when compared to that of the film without BA. Overall, the addition of BA enhanced flame retardancy and thermal stability at appropriate BA concentration. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we report a facile and cost-effective approach to synthesis carbon fiber paper (CFP) based electrode coated with reduced graphene oxide (RGO) by vacuum filtration and carbonization. The SEM image showed that graphene was deposited on each individual carbon fiber and the hybrid electrode paper retained its three dimensional structure which provided efficient percolation path ways for electrons. The specific capacitance of the hybrid paper reached 1076 mF cm(-2) at 5 mV s(-1) according to cyclic voltammetry measurement. Further, the assembled symmetric supercapacitor delivered a high capacitance of 344 mF cm(-2) at 0.5 mA cm(-2). In a word, this feasible method should be appropriate for the fabrication of carbon fiber paper based electrodes. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A low elastic modulus is urgently expected for bio-implant to avoid the harmful stress-shielding effect. Here, by using electroplastic rolling deformation, an ultralow elastic modulus of E similar to 29 GPa was achieved in a Ti-50.7at% Ni alloy. The low elastic modulus can be attributed to the existence of nanoscale lamellas of low-elastic modulus martensite phase with a high fraction of 16.2% and the sluggish stress-induced martensitic transformation and reorientation of martensite variants.

AB Due to its 2D-layered structure, MoS2 has drawn a lot of attention in energy storage device. Herein, yolkshell MoS2 (YS-MoS2) microspheres were fabricated through a facile hydrothermal method with the presence of PEG-800. Both the shell and the core of the microsphere are composed of numerous self-assembly ultrathin nanosheets. In addition, the interlayer spacing of the synthesized YS-MoS2 is larger than the standard value of MoS2. As a supercapacitor electrode material, the YS-MoS2 showed high specific capacitance (343.0 F.g(-1) at 0.25 A.g(-1)) and excellent cyclic stability (120% of the initial specific capacitance was retained after 1000 cycles at 2.0 A.g(-1)). The excellent electrochemical performances of synthesized YSMoS2 may be ascribed to its yolk-shell structure, hierarchical porous structure and expanded interlayer spacing. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Carbon is the most widely used electrode for the supercapacitors. This work applies the artificial neural network (ANN) technology to predict the capacitance of carbon-based supercapacitors. For training the ANN model, we extracted data from hundreds of published papers. Moreover, five features were selected to figure out their impact on capacitance, including specific surface area, calculated pore size, I-D/I-G ratio, N-doping level and voltage window. Then, several carbon-based samples were chosen to evaluate the performance of ANN. As the result, comparing to other machine learning methods, such as linear regression and Lasso, ANN exhibits the best accuracy and adaptability in the capacitance predication. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB A hyperelastic percolative conductive composite is proposed with acetylene black (AB) as conductive filler introduced into Ecoflex (R) 00-30 elastomer matrix. The conductivity could be enhanced by several orders according to percolation theory and the Young's modulus could also be tailored by modifying AB volume ratio. The AB-Ecoflex composite exhibits electric conductivity high as 6.4 S.m(-1) and remains stable after 100 cycles at 200% strain. This composite with high conductivity, stretchability and stability shows high potential as a competitive candidate for wearable strain sensors to detect human body motions and for human-machine interface application.

AB Coating a thin-layer solid lubricant with low adhesion and friction is desired for silica-based micro/nano electromechanical systems (MEMS/NEMS). Onion carbon is a promising one, especially fluorine-containing onion carbon with low surface adhesion. Herein we report a new route to synthesize fluorine-containing onion carbon (FOC) through carbonizing electrophoresis-deposited organic films. A little fluorine (1.65-3.64 at.%) could manyfold decrease the surface adhesion. The optimized FOC integrates the merits of fluorine doping and onion carbon, presenting ultralow surface adhesion (2.72 nN) and friction coefficient (0.03). These results suggest that this strategy is a promising approach to fabricate the desired solid lubricants for MEMS/NEMS. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB CuO/ZnO nanocomposites were prepared by a simple, low temperature hydrothermal method and followed by anodization technique on Indium-doped tin oxide (ITO) coated on the glass substrate. The prepared sample was characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and UV-vis. All results confirmed the deposition of CuO on the surface of ZnO nanorod arrays. Further, CuO/ZnO nanocomposite-based UV photodetectors were characterized by standard I-V curves. As a result, CuO/ZnO nanocomposite devices exhibited high responsivity, photocurrent gain, and good reliability as compared to pure ZnO nanorod devices. Therefore, the nanocomposites of CuO/ZnO devices show good promise for UV photodetectors with possibility to fine-tune properties, and it is worthy of further investigation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB A novel flexible electronic nose (E-nose) with multiple sensing capabilities of gas/pressure/temperature is achieved by coating interfacial polymerized polyaniline (PANI) nanofibers on porous cotton textile. The E-nose has a competitive detecting ability of ammonia gas compared to the reported PANI-based material, achieving super low detection limit (1 ppm) as well as high sensitivity (10.3 for 50 ppm) due to the high surface area of hierarchical PANI nanofibers. Furthermore, the as-prepared E-nose possesses highly sensitive pressure response (0.073 kPa(-1)) and effective monitoring of temperature (0.44 degrees C-1). This work significantly enriches the E-nose's functions to three further, which makes the E-nose more humanoid with sensing capabilities of smell, tactility, and hot/cold perception.

AB A superhydrophobic/superoleophilic copper mesh with CuCl crystals for oil/water separation has been fabricated by immersing copper mesh in acidic CuCl2 solution and then grafting with 1-dodecanethiol. The mesh exhibits superhydrophobicity, with a water contact angle (WCA) of 151 degrees and a water sliding angle of 4 degrees. The mesh was used to separate various oil/water mixtures, including isooctane/water, petroleum ether/water, n-hexadecane/water, n-hexane/water and chloroform/water, with separation efficiencies over 95%. The mesh still kept separation efficiency above 99% and a WCA of 146 degrees even after 20 separation cycles for chloroform/water mixture. In addition, the mesh could not only maintain high hydrophobicity after 50 g sand impact but also resist water droplets with different pH, indicating it has good mechanical and chemical durability.

AB The NaF dual-ion battery was demonstrated as potential battery where fluoride and sodium ions were extracted from NaF electrolyte respectively during discharging; while the charging process causes the release of ions to the electrolyte. However, previous studies reveal that electrode configuration with large-sized particles will significantly reduce the energy density and stability. Herein, we proposed a novel hybrid electrode assembly of bismuth nanoparticles/carbon nanotubes (nano-Bi@CNTs), which could achieve the excellent electrochemical stability. The new NaF dual-ion battery, consisting of nano-Bi@CNTs-Na0.44MnO2 (NMO), demonstrates a high specific capacity of 109.5 mAh/g after 80 cycles with 100 mA/g current density. Moreover, the electrochemical mechanism of fluoride ion in this system was comprehensively investigated. The current research is significant for the novel anion energy storage system.

AB Ti-43Al-9V-0.3Y (at%) and Ti-6Al-4V (at%) alloys were successfully welded by electron beam to investigate the microstructure evolution of the joints. The results showed that the microstructure of the weld is comprised of alpha(2)-Ti3Al, gamma-TiAl, together with a few residual alpha-TiAl solid solution and B2 phase (ordering by beta-TiAl solid solution). The casting structure is formed during the solidification process of the weld, which inevitably causes component segregation in some parts of the joint. In high Al content regions, Al element drives a phase ordering into alpha(2) phase, and eventually introduces the formation of alpha/gamma or alpha(2)/gamma lamellar structures. Conversely, in some regions with low Al content, alpha phases hardly experience microstructure evolution and thus remains to room temperature. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Triethoxyoctylsilane modified nano-silica (TOS-SiO2) embedded polystyrene (PS) based transparent superhydrophobic coating (SHC) has been synthesized on a glass substrate via a facile sol-gel method. A dip-pulling process was employed to synthesize the coating. The morphology of the PS/TOS-SiO2 coating revealed V-shape dyads like porous structure. The static water contact angle (CA) of 162 +/- 2 degrees with a sliding angle (SA) of 3 +/- 1 degrees was obtained for the synthesized coating. The thin coating showed a high average transmittance of 91.8 +/- 0.5% close to the average transmittance of bare glass (92.6 +/- 0.2%). An appropriate amount of TOS-SiO2 embedded PS with unique morphology and average roughness of 65.39 +/- 6.7 nm provided a transparent SHC. The transparency and roughness of the SHC were optimized by controlling the dip/pull speed and time. The developed transparent SHC can be utilized for self-cleaning application of the cover glass of solar panels. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Uniformly dispersed carbon nanotubes (CNTs) reinforced aluminum (Al) alloy matrix composite foams were successfully fabricated by the combination of in-situ chemical vapor deposition and powder metallurgy using titanium hydride as a blowing agent. The effects of CNTs on the pore structure were systematically studied. The results showed that compared to the Al alloy foam, the introduction of CNTs could significantly improve the pore uniformity and reduce the pore size. As a result, the compressive property of composite foam had an obvious increase. The reasons for the enhanced pore structure mainly lie in that the CNTs increased nucleation sites for the decomposed hydrogen and the limited the movements of bubbles in the melt during foaming process.

AB Graphene oxide (GO) has never been considered as a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) contrast agent since it was conceived as a diamagnetic material. There is a possibility that introduction of structural defects or manipulation of oxygen functionalities in GO change its magnetic response and provided a chance for GO to be a contrast agent for MRI. For this purpose, reduced graphene oxide (RGO) was treated by irradiation and annealing procedures. The study on the magnetic properties of the samples confirmed that the competition between the structural defects and oxygen functionalities to magnetic moments determines the magnetism in RGO.

AB Reliability, risk and resilience are strongly related concepts and have been widely utilised in the context of water infrastructure performance analysis. However, there are many ways in which each measure can be formulated (depending on the reliability of what, risk to what from what, and resilience of what to what) and the relationships will differ depending on the formulations used. This research has developed a framework to explore the ways in which reliability, risk and resilience may be formulated, identifying possible components and knowledge required for calculation of each and formalising the conceptual relationships between specified and general resilience. This utilises the Safe & SuRe framework, which shows how threats to a water system can result in consequences for society, the economy and the environment, to enable the formulations to be derived in a logical manner and to ensure consistency in any comparisons. The framework is used to investigate the relationship between levels of reliability, risk and resilience provided by multiple operational control and design strategies for an urban wastewater system case study. The results highlight that, although reliability, risk and resilience values may exhibit correlations, designing for just one is insufficient: reliability, risk and resilience are complementary rather than interchangeable measures and one cannot be used as a substitute for another. Furthermore, it is shown that commonly used formulations address only a small fraction of the possibilities and a more comprehensive assessment of a system's response to threats is necessary to provide a comprehensive understanding of risk and resilience.

AB Freshwaters are important sources of greenhouse gases (GHGs) to the atmosphere that may partially offset the terrestrial carbon sink. However, current emission estimates from inland waters remain uncertain due to data paucity in key regions with a large freshwater surface area, such as China. Here, we show that the areal fluxes of GHGs (carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide) from lakes and reservoirs in China are much larger than previous estimates. Our work summarized data from 310 lakes and 153 reservoirs, and revealed diffusive emissions of 1.56 (95% confidence interval: 1.12-2.00) Tg C-CH4/Y and 25.2 (20.8-29.5) Tg C-CO2/y from reservoirs and lakes. Chinese lakes and reservoirs emit 175.0 (134.7-215.3) Tg CO2 equivalent, with 73.4% of this forcing contributed by lakes. These aquatic sources are equivalent to 14.1%-22.6% of China's estimated terrestrial carbon sink. Our results suggest a disproportionally high contribution of China's reservoirs and lakes to national and global GHGs emissions, highlighting major data gaps and the need of including more artificial and natural lakes data from developing countries like China in global GHGs budgets.

AB Conventional clarification processes imply specific facility footprints that translate into important capital costs. Ballasted flocculation, consisting of injecting ballast medium to increase floc specific gravity and size, is being increasingly used in the water industry owing to its potential for design with very high superficial velocities. However, no systematic approach has yet been proposed to compare and select an appropriate ballast medium with respect to its specific gravity and size. In order to facilitate this procedure, this research project explores the hypothesis that flocculation performance is controlled by the surface area of the medium available for ballasted flocculation. This hypothesis was tested at laboratory scale by evaluating five ballast media with differing specific gravity and size: granular activated carbon, anthracite, silica sand, ilmenite, and magnetite sand having specific gravities of 1.24, 1.45, 2.62, 3.70, and 5.08, respectively. Flocculation kinetics were monitored by measuring floc size through microscopy and with a camera installed directly on the jar-test beaker. Settling performance was monitored using turbidity measurements. This study shows that all ballast media, when expressed as total surface available during flocculation, required similar surface concentrations to achieve settled water turbidity near 1 NTU and lower. In addition, the effects from the ballast media size and specific gravity were lowered for settling time longer than 3 min. Inversely, for settling time of 12 s, larger and denser media produced lower settled water turbidity. For certain applications, lighter ballast media may be more economical because they offer more available surface area for a given mass concentration, hence reducing the amount of ballast media required in the flocculation tank. Finally, the ballast media point of zero charge and shape were not identified as key criteria for ballasted flocculation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Produced water (PW) is the largest waste stream generated by oil and gas industry. It is commonly treated by physical-chemical processes due to high salt content and poor biodegradability of water insoluble compounds, such as n-alkanes. N-alkanes can represent a major fraction of organic contaminants within PW. In this study the possibility of simultaneous n - alkane biodegradation and production of neutral lipids in a concentrated PW stream with A. borkumenis SK2 as the sole reactor inoculum was investigated. N-alkane removal efficiency up to 99.6%, with influent alkane COD of 7.4 g/L, was achieved in a continuously operated reactor system. Gas chromatography results also showed that the majority of other non-polar compounds present in the PW were biodegraded. Biodegradation of n-alkanes was accompanied by simultaneous production of neutral lipids, mostly wax ester (WE)-alike compounds. We demonstrate, that under nutrient limited conditions and 108.9 +/- 3.3 mg/L residual n-alkane concentration the accumulation of extracellular WE-alike compounds can be up to 12 times higher compared to intracellular, reaching 3.08 grams per litre of reactor volume (g/L-reactor) extracellularly and 0.28 g/L-reactor intracellularly. With residual n-alkane concentration of 311.5 +/- 34.2 mg/L accumulation of extracellular and intracellular WE-alike compounds can reach up to 6.15 and 0.91 g/L-reactor. respectively. To the best of our knowledge simultaneous PW treatment coupled with production of neutral lipids has never been demonstrated before. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Carbon quantum dots (CQDs), which are a fascinating class of nanostructured carbons, have recently attracted extensive attention in the field of membrane technologies for their applications in separation processes. This is because they possess two unique advantages. Their productions are facile and inexpensive, while their physicochemical properties such as ultra-small sizes, good biocompatibility, high chemical inertness, tunable hydrophilicity, rich surface functional groups and antifouling characteristics are highly desirable. Leveraging on these, researchers have explored their utilizations in various membrane designs for reverse osmosis (RO), ultrafiltration (UF), nanofiltration (NF), forward osmosis (FO), pressure retarded osmosis (PRO), membrane distillation (MD), and organic solvent nanofiltration (OSN) processes. In particular, CQDs have especially stimulated exploration in the field of water treatment by membrane technologies since biocompatibility of membrane materials is of utmost importance to ensure safety of drinking water. In addition, CQDs are in a favorable position for achieving unprecedented performance of membrane separation processes in water treatment, in the light of substantial efficiency enhancement and antifouling propensity as discovered in recent studies. In this article, we will review the progress in the development of CQD incorporated membranes with discussions on their challenges and perspectives. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The main processes contributing to elevated effluent suspended solids in the full-scale aerobic granular sludge process were studied. The two processes found to be most important were (1) rising of sludge due to degasification of nitrogen gas (produced by denitrification) and (2) wash-out of particles that intrinsically do not settle such as certain fats and foams. A mathematical model was made to describe the process of degasification of nitrogen gas during the feeding phase in an AGS reactor. The process of rising sludge due to degasification could be limited by stripping out the nitrogen gas before starting the settling phase in the process cycle. The wash-out of scum particles could be reduced by introducing a vertical scum baffle in front of the effluent weir, similar to weirs in traditional clarifiers. A full-scale Nereda reactor in the municipality of Utrecht. The Netherlands, was operated with a nitrogen stripping phase and scum baffles for 9 months at an average biomass concentration of 10 g L-1 and an average granulation grade of 84%. In this period the influent suspended solids concentration was 230 +/- 118 mg L-1 and the concentration of effluent suspended solids was 7.8 +/- 3.8 mg L-1. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Wastewater treatment has an important responsibility to react to changing consumer and industrial produced wastes that pose environmental challenges. Surfactants are one of these emerging contaminants. They are of interest because of their increasingly ubiquitous domestic and industrial use and the difficulty their presence causes traditional treatment. In response to this developing area, this critical review considers research from a variety of technical backgrounds to provide an up to date overview of the impact of surfactants on the environment, health and their removal. This found major concerns about surfactants on the environment and on health being corroborated in the past five years. Current research into removal focuses on existing biological and chemical wastewater treatment optimisation. Despite improvements being found to traditional biological methods using chemical pre-treatments there is a clear lack of consensus regarding the ideal strategy. Drawbacks and potential solutions for a range of these technologies, including Fenton reaction and aerobic degradation, are discussed. In this field the authors recommend an improved diversity in surfactants used for the research and addressing of significant knowledge gaps. Novel methods, such as Carbon Nanotube (CNT) use are also discussed. These methods, while showing promising results, will require continual research effort to resolve present issues such as variable performance and environmental concerns. Larger scale work is also needed to validate the initial work done. Potential uses of surfactants to optimise wastewater treatment, such as Surfactant Modified Zeolites (SMZs), are also discussed. This review finds that surfactant removal from wastewater is a promising and challenging field that warrants further investigation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Ultraviolet (UV) disinfection is widely used to inactivate microorganisms prior to release of treated municipal wastewater. However, limited data are available for in situ inactivation of infectious enteric viruses by UV treatment at full-scale. In this study, a total of 51 pre-UV and 50 post-UV samples were collected over a two-year period from two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and analyzed for noroviruses, rotavirus, reovirus, sapovirus, astrovirus, enteroviruses, adenoviruses and JC virus. Both pre UV and post-IN samples had relatively high concentrations of these viruses determined by qPCR. Infectious viruses were also observed in 98% of pre-UV samples and 76% of post-UV samples by cell culture, using either cytopathic effect (CPE) or integrated cell culture with qPCR (ICC-qPCR). Reovirus was the most common virus detected by ICC-qPCR, present in 92% of pre-UV and 48% of post-UV samples. Infectious enterovirus and adenovirus were detected by ICC-qPCR in 33% and 31% of pre-UV samples, 14% and 20% of post-IN samples, respectively. Mean login reduction estimates for infectious reovirus was 1.2 and 1.8 log for the two WWTPs as assessed by ICC-qPCR, which was similar to the reduction of total infectious viruses (1.5 and 1.7 log) as assessed by CPE in cells culture. Overall, quantification of infectious reovirus appears to provide a useful index of enteric virus inactivation during wastewater treatment at full-scale. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study to assess IN inactivation of human enteric viruses at full-scale in WWTPs using both molecular and cell culture techniques, providing important information for quantitative microbial risk assessment of IN inactivation of human viruses in municipal wastewater.

AB Despite that sulfate radical-based activated peroxymonosulfate (PMS) oxidation processes (e.g., UV/PMS, Co2+/PMS, etc.) have been widely applied for decontamination, the direct oxidation of organic contaminants by PMS per se is less known. This contribution reports that certain contaminants, such as sulfonamides (SAs), are amendable to direct oxidation by PMS without activation. Using sulfamethoxazole (SMX) as a representative, kinetics and density functional theory (DFT)-based computational methods were applied to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and pathways through which SMX was transformed by direct PMS oxidation. High resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS) coupled with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analyses using authentic standards were adopted to qualifying and quantifying SMX transformation products. Our results reveal that nonradical oxidation of SMX by PMS was initiated by formation of a transition state complex between PMS molecule and amino functional group of SMX. Such reaction was assisted by two water molecules, which significantly reduced energy barrier. Direct PMS oxidation of SMX led to the formation of N-4-hydroxyl-sulfamethoxazole (N-4-OH-SMX), 4-nitroso-sulfamethoxazole (4-NO-SMX), and 4-nitro-sulfamethoxazole (4-NO2-SMX), sequentially. Implications of PMS oxidation with SAs to water treatment were further evaluated by investigating the effects of PMS dosage, pH, and natural water matrices. While PMS has a potential to transform a suite of SAs with similar structures (SMX, sulfisoxazole, sulfamethizole, sulfapyridine, sulfadiazine, and sulfachloropyridazine), the formation of potential hazardous nitroso- and nitro-byproducts should be scrutinized before this technology can be safely used for water and wastewater treatment.

AB Source-separated urine has been increasingly regarded as a promising alternative waste-stream for effectively removing pharmaceuticals and human metabolites. This study investigated the removal of sulfonamide antibiotics, one category among the most frequently detected antibiotics in the environment, by biochar and biochar/H2O2 in synthetic urine matrix. The adsorption and degradation of four parent sulfonamide antibiotics, including sulfamethoxazole, sulfadiazine, sulfamethazine, sulfa-dimethoxine, and one human metabolite, N-4-acetyl-sulfamethoxazole (together referred as SAs) were investigated. Biochar derived from cotton straw was applied as adsorbent for SAs and catalyst for H2O2. Results showed that the adsorption of SAs was inhibited in urine compared with that in phosphate buffer solution. Bicarbonate in urine placed major influence. Langmuir isotherm model well described the adsorption process in both buffer and urine matrices. Adsorption and desorption rates were estimated by a kinetic model, which well fitted the removal of SAs from aqueous phase at various biochar doses. The adsorption of SAs on biochar was due to multiple forces, in which van der Waals forces and hydrophobicity played major roles in distinguishing the sorption behavior of different SAs. To destruct the SAs, H2O2 was added with biochar. Except for N-4-acetyl-sulfamethoxazole, all the parent SAs can be degraded in urine matrix. Carbonate radical, produced from the activation of peroxymonocarbonate by biochar, was proposed to be the major contributing reactive species in biochar/H2O2 system in urine matrix.

AB Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation has been widely used in drinking water treatment processes, but its influence on the formation of disinfection by-products (DBPs), especially the emerging iodinated trihalomethanes (I-THMs) during post-chloramination remains unclear. This study evaluated the impact of low pressure (LP) UV treatment on the formation of I-THMs during post-chloramination through two pathways. The first pathway is through the transition of DOM structure and composition during UV-chloramination, resulting significant increase of I-THM formation with increasing UV dosage in different dissolved organic matter (DOM)-containing water (49.7%-90.5% at 1160 mEcm(2)). With the application of excitation emission matrix-parallel factor analysis (EEM-PARAFAC), we found that I-THM formation in UV-chloraminated water correlated well with two ratios of three PARAFAC humic-like components (C3/C2 and Cl /C2, R-2 = 0.958-1.000), suggesting that the ratios of fluorescent components can be used as reliable indicators for I-THM formation. Moreover, the shift in these fluorescent components is crucial for I-THM formation during UV-chloramination. Another pathway for UV irradiation to affect I-THM formation during post-chloramination is through the transformation of iodine species. Large amounts of reactive iodine species (HOI/I-2 and I-3(-)) can be generated directly in the mixed iodine system by UV light, leading to the enhancement of iodine utilization factor (IUF) (up to 0.040) after post-chloramination. These results suggest that UV application to DOM-containing water may induce changes in organic precursors and iodine species so as to enhance I-THM formation during post-chloramination.

The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) has established threshold limits on some DBPs, which are known as regulated DBPs (R-DBPs). The human health risks associated with R-DBPs in drinking water distribution systems (DWDSs) and application of stricter regulations have led water utilities to switch from conventional disinfectant (i.e., chlorination) to alternative disinfectants. However, the use of alternative disinfectants causes formation of a new suit of DBPs known as unregulated DBPs (UR-DBPs), which in many cases can be more toxic. There is a growing concern of UR-DBPs formation in drinking water. This review prioritizes some commonly occurring UR-DBP groups and species in DWDSs based on their concentration level, reported frequency, and toxicity using an indexing method. There are nine URDBPs group and 36 species that have been identified based on recent published peer -reviewed articles. Haloacetonitriles (HANs) and haloacetaldehydes (HALs) are identified as important UR-DBP groups. Dichloroacetonitrile (DCAN) and trichloroacetaldehye (TCAL) are identified as critical UR-DBPs species. The outcomes of this review can help water regulators to identify the most critical UR-DBPs species in the context of drinking water safety and provide them with useful information to develop guidelines or threshold limits for UR-DBPs. The outcomes can also help water utilities in selecting water treatment processes for the mitigation of human health risk posed by UR-DBPs through drinking water. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A sequential chem-bio hybrid process was developed using a novel biochar supported carboxymethyl cellulose-stabilized nanoscale iron sulfide (CMC-FeS@biochar) as a chemical remover and Corynebacterium variabile HRJ4 as a biological agent for trichloroethylene (TCE) degradation. Compared with CMCFeS, FeS@biochar600, bare FeS and biochar600, the CMC-FeS@biochar600 composite displayed better physiochemical properties (smaller hydrodynamic diameter and higher stability) and demonstrated excellent removal capacity for TCE from aqueous phase. A facultative bacterial strain, Corynebacterium variabile HRJ4, growing well in the presence of CMC-FeS@biochar (added up to 0.25 g L-1), further enhanced TCE removal after chemical treatment. The dechlorination pathway proposed based on the gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis revealed that TCE was dechlorinated to cis-1,2dichloroethene (cis-DCE) and acetylene via hydrogenolysis and beta-elimination, respectively within 12 h by CMC-FeS@biochar. Addition of HRJ4 strain into the reaction system effectively enhanced the degradation of the residual TCE, cis-DCE and acetylene to ethylene. Acetylene was the main product in chemical process, whereas ethylene was the main product in biological process as strain HRJ4 could reduce acetylene to ethylene effectively. The results of this study signify the potential application of CMC-FeS@biochar600/HRJ4 chem-bio hybrid system for complete degradation of TCE in the anaerobic environment. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Increasing amounts of saline (waste)water with high concentrations of organic pollutants are generated globally. In the anaerobic (waste)water treatment domain, high salt concentrations are repeatedly reported to inhibit methanogenic activity and strategies to overcome this toxicity are needed. Current research focuses on the use of potential osmolyte precursor compounds for osmotic stress alleviation in granular anaerobic sludges upon exposure to hypersalinity shocks. Glutamic acid, aspartic acid, lysine, potassium, gelatine, and tryptone were tested for their potential to alleviate osmotic stress in laboratory grown and full scale granular sludge. The laboratory grown granular sludge was adapted to 5 (R5) and 20 (R20) g Na+ /L. Full-scale granular sludge was obtained from internal circulation reactors treating tannery (waste)water with influent conductivity of 29.2 (Do) and 14.1 (Li) mS/cm. In batch experiments which focused on specific methanogenic activity (SMA), R5 granular sludge was exposed to a hypersalinity shock of 20 g Na+/L. The granular sludge of Do and Li was exposed to a hypersalinity shock of 10 g Na+/L with sodium acetate as the sole carbon source. The effects on R20 granular sludge were studied at the salinity level to which the sludge was already adapted, namely 20 g Na+/L. Dosing of glutamic acid, aspartic acid, gelatine, and tryptone resulted in increased SMA compared to only acetate fed batches. In batches with added glutamic acid, the SMA increased by 115% (Li), 35% (Do) and 9% (R20). With added aspartic acid, SMA increased by 72% (Li), 26% (Do), 12% (R5) and 7% (R20). The addition of tryptone resulted in SMA increases of 36% (R5), 17% (R20), 179% (Li), and 48% (Do), whereas added gelatine increased the SMA by 30% (R5),14% (R20), 23% (Li), and 13% (Do). The addition of lysine, meanwhile, gave negative effects on SMA of all tested granular sludges. Potassium at sea water Na/K ratio (27.8 w/w) had a slight positive effect on SMA of Do (7.3%) and Li (10.1%), whereas at double the sea water ratio (13.9% w/w) had no pronounced positive effect. R20 granular sludge was also exposed to hyposalinity shock from 20 down to 5 g Na+/L. Glutamate and N-acetyl-B-lysine were excreted by microbial consortium in anaerobic granular sludge adapted to 20 g Na+/L upon this exposure to hyposalinity. A potential consequence when applying these results is that saline streams containing specific and hydrolysable proteins can be anaerobically treated without additional dosing of osmolytes.

AB In this study, the spatial and temporal-distribution of 41-multiclass organic compounds were assessed in three estuaries of the Basque Country, from winter 2016 to winter 2017 by grab (active) sampling methods and an extra campaign combining both, grab and passive sampling methods. Wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents were also evaluated to assess their impact on the estuaries. Moreover, the physicochemical features (phosphate and nitrate concentrations, pH, etc.) of each site were measured and included in the statistical analysis. Anti-inflammatory drugs (diclofenac and acetaminophen), hypertensive drugs (irbesartan and valsartan), a stimulant (caffeine), an artificial sweetener (acesulfame) and a corrosion inhibitor (2-hydroxybenzothiazole) were the most ubiquitous compounds. Due to the stratification of the waters in the estuary of Bilbao two independent sources were identified: WWTP and harbour activities. In the case of Gernika and Plentzia, both are estuaries with a high tidal dilution, and the main sources were localized in the effluents of the WWTPs. In addition to this, the use of POCIS provides an efficient way to monitor emerging pollutants over a relatively long sampling period. Finally, risk quotient (RQ) values of each contaminant were estimated from the maximum values determined at each estuary and WWTP effluent for acute and chronic effects. In the case of acute toxicity the highest RQ values (>> 1) were obtained for the angiotensin II receptor blockers (telmisartan, eprosartan, etc.), diuron and diclofenac. In the case of the chronic toxicity the highest RQ values (>> 1) were estimated for caffeine, diclofenac, bezafibrate and sulfadiazine. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Despite numerous studies on changes to optical proxies of dissolved organic matter (DOM) by biogeochemical processing, the applicability of commonly-used spectroscopic indices has not been explored as DOM source tracking tools under conditions where biogeochemical processes may alter them. For this study, two contrasting DOM end members, Suwannee River fulvic acid (SRFA) and algogenic DOM (ADOM), and their mixtures, were used to examine the potential changes in the conservative mixing behaviors of several well-known optical indices via end member mixing analysis under the influence of biodegradation, UV irradiation, and clay mineral (kaolin) adsorption. Most of the source tracking indices exhibited large deviations from conservative mixing behavior between the two end-members. Biodegradation tended to lower the portions of labile and ADOM in the mixtures, while the allochthonous end member (SRFA) was reduced by a greater extent after the process of UV irradiation or adsorption. The extent of the variations in biological index (BIX) and fluorescence index (FI) was smaller for more allochthonous DOM mixtures under the processes of biodegradation and UV irradiation. Overall, the process-driven variations in ratios of humic-like: protein-like fluorescence (as modeled by parallel factor analysis, PARAFAC) were greater for the SRFA versus ADOM. Evaluation criteria used in this study suggested that BIX, specific UV absorbance (SUVA), and Fl each could be the reliable discrimination parameter least affected by biodegradation, UV irradiation, and adsorption, respectively. This study provided criterion information for the choice and the interpretation of the optical indices for DOM source discrimination in aquatic environments after substantial biogeochemical processing.

AB Biological floc size is an important reactor microenvironment parameter that is often not experimentally controlled due to a lack of suitable methods. Here, we introduce the Couette-Taylor bioreactor (CTB) as an improved tool for controlling biological floc size, specifically as compared with bubble -column sequencing batch reactors (SBRs). A CTB consists of two concentric walls, either of which may be rotated to induce fluid motion. The induced flow produces hydrodynamic shear which is more uniform than that produced through aeration in SBRs. Because hydrodynamic shear is a major parameter controlling floc size, we hypothesized the ability to better control shear rates within a CTB would enable better -controlled floc sizes. To test this hypothesis, we measured the particle size distributions of activated sludge flocs from CTBs with either inner (iCTB) or outer (oCTB) rotating walls as well as SBRs with varying height to diameter ratios (0.5,1.1, and 9.4). The rotation speed of the CTBs and aeration rate of the SBRs were varied to produce predicted mean shear rates from 25 to 250 s(-1). Further, the shear rate distributions for each experiment were estimated using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). In all SBR experiments, the floc distributions did not significantly vary with shear rate or geometry, likely because shear rates (estimated by CFD) differed much less than originally predicted by theory. In the CTB experiments, the mean particle size decreased proportionally with increased hydrodynamic shear, and iCTBs produced particle size distributions with smaller coefficients of variation than oCTBs (0.3 vs. 0.5-0.7, respectively).

AB The degradation of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) by the UV/H2O2 and UV/chlorine processes was compared at practical concentrations in simulated drinking water and wastewater. In pure water, the UV/chlorine process performed better than the UV/H2O2 process for the degradation of 16 PPCPs among the investigated 28 PPCPs under neutral conditions. Interestingly, the UV/chlorine approach was superior to the UV/H2O2 approach for the removal of all PPCPs in simulated drinking water and wastewater at the same molar oxidant dosage. The radical sink by oxidants and/or H2O was 2-3 orders of magnitude higher in UV/chlorine than UV/H2O2 in pure water. Thus, the UV/chlorine process was less affected by the water and wastewater matrices than UV/H2O2. In UV/chlorine, the concentration of CIO center dot was calculated to be similar to 3 orders of magnitude greater than that of HO center dot in pure water, and the reactivities of CIO center dot with some PPCPs were as high as > 10(8)M(-1) s(-1). CIO center dot was mainly scavenged by the effluent organic matter (EfOM) with a rate constant of 1.8 x 10(4) (mg L-1)(-1) s(-1) in wastewater. Meanwhile, secondary radicals such as Br-center dot, Br-2(center dot)-, CIBr center dot-and CO3 center dot-further contributed to PPCP degradation by the UV/chlorine process in wastewater, whose concentrations were at least 2 orders of magnitude higher than that in UV/H2O2. Compared with the UV/H2O2 process, the UV/chlorine process saved 3.5-93.5% and 19.1%-98.1% electrical energy per order (EE/O) for PPCP degradation in simulated drinking water and wastewater, respectively.

AB Types and structures of phosphorus compounds influence the removal of phosphorus by coagulation. Until now, the molecular -level interaction between coagulants and phosphorus (especially organophosphates) and the relationship between removal efficiency and phosphorus structure have not been clear. This work investigated the removal of phosphorus with different structures using conventional coagulants (poly aluminum chloride (PACI) and polymerized ferric sulfate (PFS)) and a novel covalentlybound inorganic organic hybrid coagulant (CBHyC). CBHyC removed more than 98% of phosphate and most of organophosphates, had more stable performance than PACT and PFS, and was less affected by pH, initial phosphorus concentration, and co-occurring materials. Molecular dynamics simulation demonstrated that CBHyC removed phosphorus mainly through electrostatic attraction and hydrophobic interaction. Furthermore, this work established QSAR (quantitative structure activity relationship) models for removal efficiency and organophosphate structure for the first time. The model showed that atomic charges of phosphorus atoms (Q(p)) and hydrogen atoms (Q(H)(+)) in the system and the energy gap (Delta E-MO) affected electronegativity and hydrophobicity, thus influencing organophosphate removal efficiency. The model had high fitting precision and good predictive ability and has the potential to greatly reduce the cost of optimizing processes and conditions for phosphorus removal. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Oxcarbazepine (OXC) is ubiquitous in the aqueous environment. And due to its ecotoxicological effects and potential risks to human, an effective way to eliminate OXC from aqueous environment has aroused public concerns in recent years. Radical-based reactions have been shown to be an efficient way for OXC destruction, but the reactions of OXC with reactive oxygen species (ROS) and carbonate radical (CO3 center dot-) are still unclear. In this study, we focused the degradation of OXC and ROS, CO3 center dot- generation mechanism, and their roles in OXC degradation via UV and UV/H2O2. The triplet state of oxcarbazepine ((OXC)-O-3*) was found to play an important role in OXC degradation via UV. And hydroxyl radicals ((OH)-O-center dot) and singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) were found to be the dominant ROS in OXC degradation. Superoxide radical (Or) did not react with OXC directly, but it may react with intermediate byproducts. Generation of CO3 center dot- played a positive role on OXC degradation for both UV and UV/H2O2. In addition to (OH)-O-center dot, (OXC)-O-3* also contribute to CO3 center dot- production. The second-order rate constants of OXC with (OH)-O-center dot and CO3 center dot- were 1.7 x 10(10) M-1 s(-1) and 8.6 x 10(7) M-1 s(-1), respectively. Potential OXC degradation mechanisms by (OH)-O-center dot were proposed and included hydroxylation, a-ketol rearrangement, and benzylic acid rearrangement. Compared with nonselective (OH)-O-center dot, the reactions involving CO3 center dot- are mainly electron transfer and hydrogen abstraction. And the acute toxicity of OXC was lower after UV/H2O2 and UV/H2O2/HCO3- treatments, which was confirmed by luminescent bacterial assay (Vibrio fischeri bacterium). (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Chlorine is the most frequently used disinfectant and oxidant for maintaining swimming pool water quality; however, it reacts continuously with dissolved organic matter to produce disinfection by-products (DBPs), which are a health risk for pool users. UV treatment is used widely to remove chloramines, which are the most prevalent group of DBPs, albeit chloro-organic DBP concentrations often increase during post-UV chlorination.
   In this work, UV and ozone treatments were investigated as additional technologies to eliminate DBP formation and their precursors. Batch experiments were conducted under controlled conditions, using realistic UV and ozone dosages and real pool water samples collected from a public swimming pool.
   A gradual increase in all investigated DBP concentrations and predicted toxicity was observed during chlorination after repeated UV treatments, and concentrations of certain DBPs also increased during post-ozone chlorination. Based on ozone and chlorine's similar reactivity, ozone was used directly after UV treatment to decrease the induction of DBP formation. Most DBP concentrations decreased during repeated combined treatments. It was also observed that DBP formed by post -ozone chlorination was removed by photolysis, thereby indicating synergy between the treatments. Repeated treatments using realistic UV and ozone dosages predicted that water quality will improve as a result of continuous combined UV and ozone treatments. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In an effort to provide early warnings for the occurrence of eutrophication, it is highly desirable to develop an accurate and efficient technique to ensure continuous monitoring of dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) in the aquatic environment from the viewpoint of environmental management. Herein, a new diffusive gradient in thin film (DGT) technique was developed and evaluated for in situ measurement of DRP in waters, in which Zr-based metal organic frameworks (MOFs. UiO-66) were utilized as aqueous binding agent (abbreviated as UiO-66 DGT). As expected, the UiO-66 DGT demonstrated high uptake capacity towards phosphorus (20.8 mu g P cm(-2)). Meanwhile, an excellent linearity between the accumulated DRP mass and deployment time over 5 d (R-2 = 0.996) was obtained regardless of high or low phosphate solution. In addition, effective diffusion coefficients (D) of DRP increased exponentially with increasing ionic strengths (R-2 = 0.99). Based on the rectified D, the performance of the UiO-66 DGT was independent of solution pH (6.5-8.5) and ionic strengths (ranging from 0.01 to 100 mmol L-1). Furthermore, field deployments of the UiO-66 DGT were undertaken in a natural eutrophic lake (Lake Chaohu, China). It was noteworthy that DRP could be continually accumulated by the UiO-66 DGT for more than 14 d and good agreements were obtained between the concentrations measured by DGT (C-DGT) and those by ex situ chemical extraction method in solution (c(sol)), as reflected by C-DGT/C-sol of 0.9-1.1. In situ determination of DRP speciation was also carried out at different sites across Lake Chaohu. Overall, this study contributed to a better constructing of liquid binding phase DGT for the measurement of DRP in waters, facilitating the widespread application of the UiO-66 DGT as a routine monitoring technique and for large-scale environmental analysis.

AB Herein, we proposed a new catalytic oxidation system, i.e., iron(III)-tetraamidomacrocyclic ligand (Fem(III)-TAML) mediated activation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS), for highly efficient organic degradation using pchlorophenol (4-CP) as a model one. PMS/Fem(III)-TAML is capable of degrading 4-CP completely in 9 min at the initial 4-CP of 50 mu M and pH = 7, whereas the recently explored system, H2O2/Fem(III)-TAML, could only result in similar to 22% 4-CP removal in 20 min under otherwise identical conditions. More attractively, inorganic anions (i.e.,cl(-), SO42- , NO3-, and HCO3-) exhibited insignificant effect on 4-CP degradation, and the negative effect of natural organic matters (NOM) on the degradation of 4-CP in PMS/Fe-III-TAML is much weaker than the sulfate radical-based oxidation process (PMS/Co2+). Combined with in-situ XANES spectra, UV-visible spectra, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra, and radical quenching experiments, high-valent iron-oxo complex (Fe-Iv(O)TAML) instead of singlet oxygen (O-1(2)), superoxide radical (O-2(center dot-)), sulfate radicals (SO4 center dot-) and hydroxyl radicals (HO center dot-) was the key active species responsible for 4-CP degradation. The formation rate (k(I)) and consumption rate (k(II)) of the Fe-Iv(O)TAML in PMS/Fem(III)-TAML were pH-dependent in the range of 6.0-11.5. As expected, increasing the Fem(III)-TAML and PMS dosage resulted in a higher steady-state concentration of Fe-Iv(O)TAML and enhanced the 4-CP degradation accordingly. In addition, the oxidation capacity of PMS was almost totally utilized in PMS/Fem(III)-TAML for 4-CP oxidation due to the two-electron abstraction from 4-CP by one PMS. We believe this study will shed new light on effective PMS activation by Fe-ligand complexes to efficiently degrade organic contaminants via nonradical pathway. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This work uncovers the implications of the estimation of exogenous inactivation rates for E. coli after the initial lag phase, and presents a strategy for the determination of the second-order inactivation rate constants (k2nd) of these bacteria with relevant transient species promoted by solar light in natural waters. For this purpose, specific precursors were considered (nitrate ion, rose bengal, anthraquinone-2sulfonate) as well as the respective photo-generated transient species (i.e., hydroxyl radical (center dot OH), singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) and triplet excited states). Under these conditions and by using suitable reference compounds (acesulfame K and 2,4,6-trimethylphenol in different series of experiments), the k2nd values were obtained after developing a proper competition kinetics methodology. The k2nd values were (2.5 +/- 0.9) x 10(11), (3.8 +/- 1.6) x 10(7) and (1.8 +/- 0.7) x 10(10) M-1 s(-1) for the inactivation of E. coli by center dot OH, O-1(2) and the triplet state of anthraquinone-2-sulfonate ((3)AQ2S*), respectively. The measurement of a reaction rate constant that is higher than the diffusion-control limit for small molecules in aqueous solution implies that bacteria behave differently from molecules, e.g., because of the large size difference between bacteria and the transients. The obtained k2nd values were used for the modeling of the bacteria inactivation kinetics in outdoor systems (both water bodies and SODIS bottles), limited to the exponential decay phase that follows the initial lag time. Afterwards, the role of dissolved organic matter (DOM) as precursor of transient species for bacterial elimination was systematically studied. The interaction of different sunlight wavelength regions (UV-B, UV-A, blue, green and yellow light) with Suwannee river (SW) and Nordic Lake organic matter (ND) was tested, and the photoinduced disinfection exerted by DOM isolates (SW DOM, Suwannee River Humic Acid, Suwannee River Fulvic Acid or Pony Lake Fulvic Acid) was compared. It was not possible to achieve a complete differentiation of the individual contributions of DOM triplet states ((DOM)-D-3*) and O-1(2) to bacterial inactivation. However, the application of competition kinetics to E. coli under solar irradiation in the presence of SW led to a k2nd value of (2.17 +/- 0.40) x 10(10) M-1 s(-1), which is very near the value for inactivation by (3)AQ2S* and suggests that the latter behaved very similar to SW-(DOM)-D-3* and was a good (DOM)-D-3* proxy in the present case. The determination of the second-order inactivation rate constants of E. coli with center dot OH, (DOM)-D-3* and O-1(2) represents a significant progress in the understanding of the external inactivation pathways of bacteria. It also allows predicting that, after the lag phase, O-1(2) would contribute to photoinactivation to a far lesser extent than center dot OH and (DOM)-D-3*. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Iodinated disinfection byproducts (DBPs) are widely present in disinfected drinking waters and waste-water effluents, and they have drawn increasing concern owing to their high toxicity. To date, the reported iodinated DBPs mainly include aliphatic and aromatic ones, and iodinated trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs) are the most commonly detected aliphatic iodinated DBPs in disinfected waters. In this study, the formation of iodinated THMs and HAAs from aromatic iodinated DBPs during chloramination was investigated. The decomposition kinetics of the aromatic iodinated DBPs and the formation of iodinated THMs and HAAs were studied, the formation pathways of iodinated THMs and HAAs from the aromatic iodinated DBPs were explored, the factors affecting the formation were examined, and the toxicity change was evaluated. The results revealed that four aromatic iodinated DBPs (2,4,6-triiodophenol, 3,5-diiodo-4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, 3,5-diiodosalicylic acid, and 2,6-diiodo-4nitrophenol) all underwent transformation to form triiodomethane (TIM), monoiodoacetic acid (MIAA), and diiodoacetic acid (DIAA) during chloramination. The decomposition of the aromatic iodinated DBPs all followed a pseudo-first-order decay during chloramination, and the rank order of the decomposition rate constants was as follows: 2,4,6-triiodophenol > 3,5-diiodo-4-hydroxybenzaldehyde >= 3,5-diiodosalicylic acid > 2,6-diiodo-4-nitrophenol. Several polar iodinated intermediates were detected and identified (e.g., 2,6-diiodo-1,4-benzoquinone and iodobutenedioic acid) during chloramination of 2,4,6-triiodophenol, based on which the formation pathways of TIM, MIAA, and DIAA from 2,4,6-triiodophenol during chloramination were proposed and further validated. The results also revealed that monochloramine dose, pH, temperature, and short free chlorine contact time all affected the formation of TIM, MIAA, and DIAA from 2,4,6-triiodophenol during chloramination. The cytotoxicity order of the eight iodinated DBPs was MIAA > 2,6-diiodo-4-nitrophenol > 2,4,6-triiodophenol > 2,6diiodo-1,4-benzoquinone > DIAA >= 3,5-diiodosalicylic acid >3,5-diiodo-4-hydroxybenzaldehyde > TIM. The toxicity of the chloraminated 2,4,6-triiiodophenol sample first decreased and then increased over time due to the transformation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In order to attain a high-efficiency and low-cost adsorbent for both arsenate (As(V)) and arsenite (As(III)) removal from As-contaminated water, a novel nanostructured Fe-Ti-Mn composite oxide (FTMO) was fabricated through a one-step simultaneous oxidation and co-precipitation method. Batch control experiments and series of spectroscopy detection technologies were carried out to investigate the surface change of the FTMO adsorbent and the respective role of Fe, Ti and Mn content in the arsenic adsorption process. The results showed that the FTMO adsorbent had a high adsorption capacity for both As(V) and As(III) (especially for the latter one) via the formation of inner-sphere complexes at the water/oxide interface under both darkness and light conditions. The material could effectively oxidize As(III) to As(V) and light illumination could further apparently enhance the As(III) oxidation, thus achieving high adsorption efficiency of As(III). Combined with the characterizations from FTIR, ESR and XPS, it was assumed that the predominant As(III) removal mechanism could be attributed to the coupling of various processes including photooxidation, oxidation and adsorption. The Ti and Mn contents were dominant for the As(III) oxidation, while the Fe content mainly played an important role for the adsorption of newly formed As(V). However, the involvement of surface hydroxyl groups and the formation of inner sphere surface complexes were primarily responsible for the As(V) adsorption mechanism. Moreover, the successful removal of arsenic from real water matrices made the FTMO a potentially attractive adsorbent for both As(V) and As(III) removal. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Capacitive de-ionization (CDI) systems are well-known for their low energy consumption making them suitable for applications powered by renewable energy. In this study, CDI technology is, for the first time, integrated with a suitably-scaled, stand-alone, renewable power system comprising photovoltaic panels and battery storage. Guidelines for designing and sizing such power systems are proposed including determining electrode charging current, PV panels and battery capacity. A 1 kW pilot plant was designed, constructed and operated to verify the proposed guidelines. Using the pilot plant, the total energy consumption of the system has been evaluated with different electrode charging currents and influent flow rates and the relationship between these parameters analyzed. This analysis has enabled the development of practical design guidelines for bulk water treatment with MCDI electrodes. The results of this study show that use of photovoltaic-powered MCDI water treatment, particularly when combined with energy recovery, is competitive against more mature water-treatment technologies for particular applications and at particular locations.

AB This work investigated the long-term stability of aerobic granular sludge treating high-strength organic wastewater in a semi-pilot scale sequential batch reactor (SBR). The reactor was operated for 316 days under different operational conditions. It was found that the F/M ratio is an important parameter affecting granules formation and stability. Three selection mechanisms were investigated: (1) cultivation and maturation at moderately high influent COD concentration (2500 mg/L) followed by increase in influent COD concentration to 7500 mg/L: (2) stressed cultivation and operation at high influent COD concentration of 4500 mg/L; and (3) alternate feed loading strategy (variable influent COD concentration across the daily schedule of cycles at 50%, 75%, and 100% of the peak concentration of 5000 mg/L). It was found that adopting high OLR at the reactor start-up accelerated the formation of granules. However, the overgrowth of biomass under high organics concentration negatively affected the stability of granules and led to disintegration due to the presence of methanogens in the granule core. Cultivation at high organics concentration resulted in a rapid loss of microbial diversity and reactor failure. Under alternate feed loading, adequate selection of microbial community was maintained and resulted in stable reactor performance. Moreover, a strong correlation between F/M ratio and the granules settling ability was observed. When F/M ratio exceeded 1.5 gCOD/gSS.d, granules showed poor settleability and under very high sludge loading rates (above 2.5), sludge bulking occurred and led to washout of sludge due to the strong selection pressure of short settling time. Operating the reactor at F/M ratio of 0.5-1.4 gCOD/gSS.d appears to favor stable long-term granule stability. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB As a consequence of the suspended sediments in river water, cake formation on the streambed and clogging of the aquifer may occur, leading to a decline in the production yield of riverbank filtration systems, particularly in highly turbid river waters. However, naturally occurring flow forces may induce sufficient scouring of the streambed, thereby self-regulating the thickness of the formed cake layer. This study assessed the recovery of the infiltration capacity in a simulated physically clogged riverbank filtration system, due to self-cleansing processes. A straight tilting flume, provided with an infiltration column at the bottom, was used for emulating clogging, infiltration and self-cleansing. Based on the presented research it may be concluded that the infiltration of a mixture of different sediments, as found in natural water bodies, can already be recovered at low shear stresses. Clay and silt behaved very differently, due to the difference in cohesiveness. Clay was found to produce a persistent sticky cake layer, whereas silt penetrated deeper into the bed, both resulting in an absence of infiltration velocity recovery. A cake layer of fine sand sediments was easiest to remove, resulting in dune formation on the streambed. However, due to deep bed clogging by fine sand particles in a coarser streambed, the infiltration velocity did not fully recover. The interaction between mixed suspended sediments (5% clay, 80% silt, and 15% fine sand) resulted in uneven erosion patterns during scouring of the streambed and recovery of the infiltration velocity is low. Altogether it may be concluded that natural recovery of infiltration capacity during river bank filtration of highly turbid waters is expected to occur, as long as the river carries a mixture of suspended sediments and the sand of the streambed is not too coarse.

AB Because of the eminent adsorptive capacity and rate for dissolved organic molecules compared to conventionally-sized powdered activated carbon (PAC), super-fine powdered activated carbon (SPAC) is gathering momentum for use in not only the pretreatment for membrane filtration for drinking water purification but also the conventional water purification process consisting of coagulation-flocculation, sedimentation, and rapid sand-filtration (CSF). However, the probability of SPAC particles to leak through a sand bed is higher than that of PAC, and their strict leakage control is an issue to be challenged when applying SPAC to CSF. However, study focusing on very high particle removal, which yield residual concentrations down to around 100 particles/mL, has been very limited. A previous study mentioned that the tendency of SPAC leakage is related to its low destabilization. In response to this, the present study focused on the two key components of coagulation (mixing intensity and coagulants) and investigated how to effectively reduce the residual SPAC after CSF.
   Astonishingly, the flash mixing (the first process of CSF), especially its G (velocity gradient) value, played the most important role in determining the residual SPAC in the filtrate of sand filter (the fourth process). Even if the slow mixing time was short, a sufficiently large G value but short T (mixing time) value in flash mixing effectively reduced the residual SPAC. When the total GT value of flash and slow mixing was fixed at a constant, priority should be given to flash mixing to reduce the residual SPAC.
   Among 23 PACI (poly-aluminum chloride) coagulants, PACI with a high-basicity (basicity 70%) and with sulfate ion (0.14 of sulfate/aluminum in molar ratio), produced by Al(OH)(3)-dissolution, were the most effective to reduce the residual SPAC after CSF. PACIs produced by base-titration, which have been intensively investigated in previous researches, were not effective due to lack of floc-formation ability. However, their Al species composition determined by the ferron method were almost the same as those of PACT by Al(OH)(3)-dissolution, and their charge-neutralization capacities were higher. PACIs produced by Al(OH)(3)-dissolution possessed both charge-neutralization and floc-formation abilities, but the former ability was more important to minimize the residual of SPAC.

AB Roxarsone (ROX) is used in breeding industry to prevent infection by parasites, stimulate livestock growth and improve pigmentation of livestock meat. After being released into environment, ROX could be bio-degraded with the formation of carcinogenic inorganic arsenic (As) species. Here, ferrate oxidation of ROX was reported, in which we studied total-As removal, determined reaction kinetics, identified oxidation products, and proposed a reaction mechanism. It was found that the apparent second-order rate constant (k(app)) of ferrate with ROX was 305 M(-1)s(-1) at pH 7.0, 25 degrees C, and over 95% of total As was removed within 10 min when ferrate/ROX molar ratio was 20:1. Species-specific rate constants analysis showed that HFeO(4) over bar was the dominant species reacting with ROX. Ferrate initially attacked As-C bond of ROX and resulted in the formation of arsenate and 2-nitrohydroquinone. The arsenate was simultaneously removed by ferric nanoparticles formed in the reduction of ferrate, while 2-nitrohydroquinone was further oxidized into nitro-1,4-benzoquinone. These results suggest that ferrate treatment can be an effective method for the control of ROX in water treatment. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Ultraviolet light emitting diodes (UV-LEDs) have shown a potential to replace traditional Ultraviolet (UV) pressure lamps for water disinfection. However, the research is not sufficient and hence, it is still difficult to make any logical conclusions. In this work, UV-LEDs with peak emissions at 267, 275, 310 nm and combined emissions at 267/275, 267/310 and 275/310 nm were applied to a batch water disinfection system. Under either single- or combined-wavelength situation, the inactivation efficiency, reactivation (due to photoreactivation and dark repair) after UV irradiation and electrical energy consumption were evaluated by way of the model bacterium Escherichia coli. It was found that, the 267 nm UV-LED had the highest inactivation efficiency than other UV-LEDs. Although reactivation occurred after 267, 275, 267/275 and 275/310 nm UV-LEDs' irradiations, it occurred to a lesser extent in dark repair than in photo reactivation, demonstrating that photo-effect is the dominant mechanism of reactivation. In addition, decay phase was more prominent than reactivation in dark repair. However, the irradiation by the 275 nm UV-LED showed a better persistence against reactivation which could be attributed to protein damage at 275 nm. No synergistic effect for combined wavelengths was observed in this study. The electrical energy consumption was lower for the 275 nm UV-LED than the other UV-LEDs which was attributed to its higher wall plug efficiency. This study showed the variation principle between the single and combined UVB/UVC-LEDs in inactivation efficiency, inhibition of reactivation, synergistic effect and electrical energy consumption in treatment of E. coli, which is useful for the reasonable exploitation of UV-LEDs in water disinfection systems.

AB In the top layer of aerated rapid sand filtration systems, uncharged As(III) is biologically converted to charged As(V). Subsequently, the main removal mechanism for As(V) is adsorption onto oxidised, flocculated Fe(III) (hydrous ferric hydroxides; HFO). The aim of this research was to understand the interactions between As and Fe in biologically active rapid filter columns and investigate the effect of different operational modes on Fe removal to subsequently promote As removal. For this purpose, different filter media column experiments were performed using natural, aerated groundwater containing 3.4 mu g/l As(III). Results show that independent of the filter media size, complete (biological) conversion of As(III), manganese, ammonium and nitrite was achieved in approximately 70 days. After ripening, enhanced As removal was achieved with a top layer of coarse media or by dosing additional Fe(III). Addition of Fe(II) did not have the same effect on As removal, potentially due to heterogeneous Fe(II) oxidation in the upper layer of the filter, attaching rapidly to the filter grain surface and thereby preventing HFO flocs to penetrate deeper into the bed. Increasing the flow rate from 1 to 4 mill did not improve As removal and lowering the pH from 8 to 7.4, resulted in an 55% increased removal of dissolved As. Altogether it is concluded that As removal in biologically active rapid sand filters can be improved by applying coarser filter media on top, in combination with dosing Fe(III) and/or pH correction.

AB Remediating uranium contamination becomes a worldwide interest because of increasing uranium release from mining activities. Due to ubiquitous presence of pyrite and the application of iron-based technology, colloidal iron oxy-hydroxides such as akaganeite colloid (AKC) extensively exist in uranium polluted water at uranium tailing sites. In this context, we studied individual and co-transport of U(VI) and AKC in water-saturated sand columns at 50 mg/L AKC and environmentally relevant U(VI) concentrations (5.0 x 10(-7) similar to 5.0 x 10(-5) M). It was found that, in addition to the impact of pH and ionic strength, whether AKC facilitated U(VI) transport depended on U(VI) concentration as well. The presence of AKC facilitated U(VI) transport at relatively low U(VI) concentration (5.0 x 10(-7) similar to 5.0 x 10(-6) M), which was due to the strong adsorption of U(VI) on AKC and faster transport of AKC than that U(VI) as observed in their individual transport experiments. At relatively high U(VI) concentrations (5.0 x 10-5 M), however, AKC impeded U(VI) transport because U(VI) of high concentration decreased AKC colloidal stability and increased AKC aggregation and attachment. Thus, U(VI) and AKC co-transport was even blocked completely at relatively high pH and ionic strength. The mechanisms behind the co-transport of U(VI) and AKC were also confirmed by assessing the evolutions of aqueous pH and AKC zeta potential and particle size distribution in the column effluents. A two-site non-equilibrium model and a two-site kinetic attachment/detachment model well-described the breakthrough curves of U(VI) and AKC, respectively. Knowledge generated from this study provides a thorough understanding of uranium transport in the absence/presence of AKC, and brings new insights into the influence of contaminant concentration on co-transport in the presence of colloids.

AB Increasing attention has been dedicated to trace phthalates in bottled water due to the serious concerns on public health, while there is still a lack of systematic analysis and assessment of current global situation. Through analyzing five representative phthalates in bottled water over 20 countries, this work clearly revealed the phthalates-associated potential risks in both human daily intake and estrogenic effect. In the risk assessment, the kinetic models were also developed to describe and predict phthalates migration. In more than three hundred brands of bottled waters from twenty one countries, the detection frequency of the five targeted phthalates was found to be in the order of dibutyl phthalate (DBP, 67.6%), di-2-(ethyl hexyl) phthalate (DEHP, 61.7%), diethyl phthalate (DEP, 47.1%), benzyl butyl phthalate (BBP, 36.9%), and dimethyl phthalate (DMP, 30.1%). Among the countries studied relating concentrations of DEHP in bottled waters, the top five countries ranked in the order of high to low were Thailand, Croatia, Czech Republic, Saudi Arabia and China with an average level of 61.1, 8.8, 6.3, 6.2 and 6.1 mu g/L, respectively. The average levels of BBP, DBP, DMP and DEP in bottled water from Pakistan were high, in which DEP and DMP were ranked 1st among all countries with the average levels of 22.4 and 50.2 mu g/L, while BBP and DBP were ranked 2nd and 3rd with the average levels of 7.5 and 17.8 mu g/L, respectively. The human daily intake-based risk assessment revealed that phthalates in bottled waters studied would not pose a serious concern on public health. However, the adverse estrogenic effects of phthalates in bottled water from some countries appeared to be significant. This study just shed light on global situation of phthalates in bottled water, and more efforts should be needed to systematically examine the phthalates-related safety of bottled water.

AB Microbial mats, due to their high microbial diversity, have the potential to express most biogeochemical cycling processes, highlighting their prospective use in bioremediation of various environmental contaminants. In this study the mechanisms of nitrogen attenuation were investigated in naturally occurring microbial mats from Elkhorn Slough, Monterey Bay, CA, USA, and Baja California Sur, Mexico. Key processes responsible for this removal were evaluated using quantification of functional genes related to nitrification, denitrification, and nitrogen fixation. Both microbial mats were capable of removing high (up to 2 mM) concentrations of ammonium and nitrate. Ammonium assimilation rates measured for Elkhorn Slough mats showed that this process was responsible for most of the ammonium uptake in these mats. While Elkhorn Slough mats did not show any evidence of nitrogen removal pathways other than microbial assimilation, Baja mats exhibited the potential for nitrification, denitrification, and DNRA as well as assimilation. The results of this study demonstrate the potential of microbial mats for bioremediation of nitrogenous pollutants independent of the mechanisms responsible for their removal.

AB Microplastic (particles < 5 mm) pollution dynamics are well documented in oceans and increasingly studied in freshwater. We used a watershed-scale approach to examine spatial and temporal patterns in microplastic concentrations in the Gallatin River watershed (Montana, USA). At 72 sites, trained volunteers collected similar to 1-L grab samples at 4 seasons per year over 2 years (n = 714 samples). Micro plastics were found in 57% of the samples (mean = 1.2 particles L-1). The majority of particles were fibers (80%), 0.1-1.5 mm long. Chemical identification determined 93% of particles measured by mu FT-IR were synthetic or semi-synthetic materials. Microplastic concentration differed significantly among dates, but showed no longitudinal pattern or relationship to land-use among subwatersheds. At two sites with gaging stations, microplastic was negatively related to discharge when compared across dates. This suggests stormwater is not a source of microplastic in this watershed, but instead dilutes microplastic inputs from other sources. We conclude that microplastic sources are diverse, and measurements of microplastic deposition, resuspension, and transport may be needed to clarify the role of land-use patterns on microplastic pollution. This large scale, citizen science based approach provides a model for future analysis which can further expand microplastic collection at the watershed scale. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Interplay between physical cleaning, membrane pore size and fluid
   rheology during the evolution of fouling in membrane bioreactors

AB Fouling is one of the most pressing limitations during operation of membrane bioreactors, as it increases operating costs and is the cause of short membrane lifespans. Conducting effective physical cleanings is thus essential for keeping membrane operation above viable performance limits. The nature of organic foulants present in the sludge and the membrane properties are among the most influential factors determining fouling development and thus, efficiency of fouling mitigation approaches. The role of other factors like sludge viscosity on fouling is still unclear, given that contradictory effects have been reported in the literature. In the present study we use a new research approach by which the complex interplay between fouling type, levels of permeate flux, membrane material and feed properties is analyzed, and the influence of these factors on critical flux and membrane permeability is evaluated. A variety of systems including activated sludge and model solutions with distinct rheological behavior has been investigated for two membranes differing in pore size distribution. We present a novel method for assessing the efficiency of fouling removal by backwash and compare it with the efficiency achieved by means of relaxation. Results obtained have proven that backwash delays development of critical fouling as compared with relaxation and reduces fouling irreversibility regardless of fluid rheology. It was shown that backwash is especially effective for membranes for which internal fouling is the main cause of loss in permeability. Nonetheless, we found out that for membranes with tight pores, both relaxation and backwash are equally effective. The critical flux decreases significantly for high-viscosity fluids, such as activated sludge. This effect is mainly caused by an intensified concentration polarization at the feed side rather than by internal fouling events. However, membrane permeability has been proven to rely more on the permeate viscosity than on the feed viscosity: poor rejection of organic fractions showcasing high viscosity causes an acute decline in membrane permeability as a consequence of increased shear stress inside the membrane pores.

AB To determine whether the addition of conductive materials could enhance methane production by direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET), we operated three anaerobic reactors amended with non-conductive (ceramic) or conductive materials (anthracite and granular activated carbon (GAC)). Throughout eight months of operation, ethanol was consistently detected as the major fermentation product. The specific yield in the anthracite and GAC-added reactors increased by 31.5% and 43.3%, respectively, compared to the ceramic-added reactor. 16S rRNA gene sequencing results indicated Geobacter was dominant (up to 55% of total sequences), whereas acids-degrading syntrophic bacteria were low in abundance (<2%). Using metagenomic analysis, the draft genome of the dominant Geobacter population (bin GAC1) was reconstructed and observed to possess genetic abilities of ethanol oxidation, hydrogen production, and extracellular electron transfer, and represented a phylogenetically novel Geobacter species. While Methanosaeta was the dominant methanogen, reactors containing conductive materials harbored more diverse and abundant archaeal populations, as revealed by FISH, qPCR, and metagenomics. Our findings suggested that a novel Geobacter population could oxidize ethanol and employed both hydrogen transfer and DIET depending on the accessibility of conductive materials. Thermodynamic advantages of DIET over hydrogen production could lead to enhanced methane production in reactors with conductive materials. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Modelling of the rheological behavior of mechanically dewatered sewage
   sludge in uniaxial cyclic compression

DE Uniaxial compression; Rheological modelling; Visco-elasto-plastic
   behavior; Burgers model; Ludwik equation
AB The rheological behavior of mechanically dewatered sewage sludges is complex but essential as it affects almost all treatment, utilization and disposal operations, such as storage, pumping, land-spreading, or drying. In this work, a specific methodology coupling experiments and modelling is developed to characterize the rheological and textural properties of highly concentrated sludge. The experimental part based on a uniaxial compression method has been presented in a previous paper (Liang et al., 2017). This article is dedicated to the modelling part, which includes the behavior identification and the parameters optimization. Previous and additional mechanical tests allow the identification of a visco-elasto-plastic behavior. This behavior is then modelled with a Burgers-Ludwik model, with 7 rheological parameters. This model is able to simulate the viscoelastic behavior of sludge under the yield stress, and the visco-elasto-plastic hardening behavior over the yield stress. The optimization of model parameters is carried out in two steps and relies on the calculation of basins of attraction and confidence intervals with initial conditions estimated from the mechanical tests. Finally, the entire characterization methodology, from experimental mechanical tests to model parameter optimization, is applied to sludge samples at different operating conditions and structural states. The determination of the rheological properties of sludge is achieved with excellent matching between simulation and experimental results. Being able to take into account these impact factors, the rheological model can be used to predict the sludge behavior in various operating conditions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The organic pollutants produced by cyanobacteria cells, such as off-flavor compounds (e.g. 2-methylisoborneol, 2-MIB) and hazardous toxins (e.g. microcystins), are commonly detected in water sources. Although studies have shown that oxidation using potassium permanganate (KMnO4), chlorine and ozone helps to remove cyanobacteria cells, the potential effects of these oxidants on cell viability and the release of off-flavor substances have scarcely been explored. This study investigated the impacts of three widely used oxidants on Pseudanabaena sp. (a common species of 2-MIB producing cyanobacteria) inactivation, and on the release and degradation of intracellular 2-MIB. Experiments using KMnO4 showed that both the cell viability and 2-MIB release fit to a two-stage second-order kinetic model with a threshold of KMnO4 exposure (ct). No significant variations in the cell viability and 2-MIB release occurred until the exposure reached ct because KMnO4 was primarily consumed by the dissolved and cell-bound organic matters before it damaged the cell. However, chlorine permeates the cell membrane more easily, causing rapid algae inactivation and the subsequent cell lysis and 2-MIB release. Unlike permanganate and chlorine, which are unable to degrade the released 2-MIB because of their insufficient oxidation potentials, ozone is capable to inactivate the cell and degrade 2-MIB as well. When the initial O-3 concentration is above a certain level (1.0 mg.L-1 in this study), the released 2-MIB can be substantially oxidized. Therefore, the choice of a suitable oxidant and a proper dose is highly important in the control of off-flavor compounds during the treatment of algae-containing raw water. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we systematically explored the adaption and recovery capacities of the ammonia oxidizer Nitrosomonas europaea under chronic TiO2 NP exposure and different dissolved oxygen (DO) conditions at the physiological and transcriptional levels in a chemostat reactor. N. europaea cells adapted to 50 mg/L TiO2 NP exposure after 40-d incubation and the inhibited cell growth, membrane integrity, nitritation rate, and ammonia monooxygenase activity all recovered regardless of the DO concentrations. Transmission electron microscope imaging indicated the remission of the membrane distortion after the cells' 40-d adaption to the NP exposure. The microarray results further suggested that the metabolic processes associated with the membrane repair were pivotal for cellular adaption/recovery, such as the membrane efflux for toxicant exclusion, the structural preservation or stabilization, and the osmotic equilibrium adjustment. In addition, diverse metabolic and stress-defense pathways, including aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, respiratory chain, ATP production, toxin-antitoxin 'stress-fighting', and DNA repair were activated for the cellular adaption coupled with the metabolic activity recovery, probably via recovering the energy production/conversion efficiency and mediating the non-photooxidative stress. Finally, low DO (0.5 mg/L) incubated cells were more susceptible to TiO2 NP exposure and required more time to adapt to and recover from the stress, which was probably due to the stimulation limitation of the oxygen-dependent energy metabolism with a lower oxygen supply. The findings of this study provide new insights into NP contamination control and management adjustments during the BNR process. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Soil contamination by heavy metals and metalloids has been a major concern to human health and environmental quality. While many remediation technologies have been tested at the bench scale, there have been only limited reports at the field scale. This paper aimed to provide a comprehensive overview on the field applications of various soil remediation technologies performed over the last decade or so. Under the general categories of physical, chemical, and biological approaches, ten remediation techniques were critically reviewed. The technical feasibility and economic effectiveness were evaluated, and the pros and cons were appraised. In addition, attention was placed to the environmental impacts of the remediation practices and long-term stability of the contaminants, which should be taken into account in the establishment of remediation goals and environmental criteria. Moreover, key knowledge gaps and practical challenges are identified. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The high volume of flowback water (FW) generated during shale gas exploitation is highly saline, and contains complex organics, iron, heavy metals, and sulfate, thereby posing a significant challenge for the environmental management of the unconventional natural gas industry. Herein, the treatment of FW in a sulfur-cycle-mediated microbial fuel cell (MFC) is reported. Simultaneous removal efficiency for chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total iron from a synthetic FW was achieved, at 72 +/- 7% and 90.6 +/- 8.7%, respectively, with power generation of 2667 +/- 529 mW/m(3) in a closed-circuit MFC (CC-MFC). However, much lower iron removal (38.5 +/- 4.5%) occurred in the open-circuit MFC (OC-MFC), where the generated FeS fine did not precipitate because of sulfide supersaturation. Enrichment of both sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (SOB), namely Helicobacteraceae in the anolyte and the electricity-producing bacteria, namely Desulfuromonadales on the anode likely accelerated the sulfur cycle through the biological and bioelectrochemical oxidation of sulfide in the anodic chamber, and effectively increased the molar ratio of total iron to sulfide, thus alleviating sulfide supersaturation in the closed circuitry. Enrichment of SOB in the anolyte might be attributed to the formation of FeS electricity wire and likely contributed to the stable high power generation. Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Chloroflexi enriched in the anodic chamber were responsible for degrading complex organics in the FW. The treatment of real FW in the sulfur-cycle-mediated MFC also achieved high efficiency. This research provides a promising approach for the treatment of wastewater containing organic matters, heavy metals, and sulfate by using a sulfur-cycle-mediated MFC. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB We develop numerical methods to simulate the fluid-mechanical erosion of many bodies in two-dimensional Stokes flow. The broad aim is to simulate the erosion of a porous medium (e.g. groundwater flow) with grain-scale resolution. Our fluid solver is based on a second-kind boundary integral formulation of the Stokes equations that is discretized with a spectrally-accurate Nystrom method and solved with fast-multipole-accelerated GMRES. The fluid solver provides the surface shear stress which is used to advance solid boundaries. We regularize interface evolution via curvature penalization using the theta-L formulation, which affords numerically stable treatment of stiff terms and therefore permits large time steps. The overall accuracy of our method is spectral in space and second-order in time. The method is computationally efficient, with the fluid solver requiring O(N) operations per GMRES iteration, a mesh-independent number of GMRES iterations, and a one-time O(N-2) computation to compute the shear stress. We benchmark single-body results against analytical predictions for the limiting morphology and vanishing rate. Multibody simulations reveal the spontaneous formation of channels between bodies of close initial proximity. The channelization is associated with a dramatic reduction in the resistance of the porous medium, much more than would be expected from the reduction in grain size alone. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.
