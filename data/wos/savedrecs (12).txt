AB Checkpoint immunotherapy (CIT) is an emerging and exciting treatment modality for the treatment of cancer. Much excitement has ensued in the potential of CIT to revolutionize the treatment and prognosis of brain metastases. The combination of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and CIT has also been studied and showed promise compared with either treatment modality alone. However, several questions have arisen, in particular, the timing at which SRS and CIT should be administered relative to each other. We reviewed the reported data and attempted to offer a potential answer to this question.

TI Fenestrated Mini-Clip Application to Preserve a Tightly Adhering Branch
   Artery to a Middle Cerebral Artery Aneurysm: Technical Case Report
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Adhered artery; Clipping; Fenestrated mini-clip; Narrow blade
AB BACKGROUND: Fenestrated mini-clips have been reported as useful for treating dog ear-shaped remnant aneurysms, the small aneurysms to which the efferent artery adheres or is impeded by the surrounding neurovascular structure in the restricted operative corridor, because of the smaller clip head. Here, the alternative utility of fenestrated mini-clip was reported by mentioning the narrower clip blade.
   METHODS: We report a case of middle cerebral artery aneurysm tightly adhered by the anterior temporal artery (ATA) as well as the efferent arteries and demonstrate the utility of fenestrated mini-clip.
   RESULTS: During aneurysm dissection, the superior division of the M2 segment of the middle cerebral artery and the ATA adhered tightly to the aneurysm, thereby restricting meticulous aneurysm dissection, To preserve the efferent artery and the ATA, a fenestrated standard clip was applied, transmitting the efferent artery, and the clip blade was applied in the restricted space between the adhering ATA and the aneurysm neck. However, because kinking of the ATA was observed following first clip application, the fenestrated mini-clip was applied in similar fashion to avoid kinking of the ATA instead of a standard clip, thereby preserving the ATA without further aneurysm dissection. Finally, successful obliteration of the aneurysm and preservation of the ATA were achieved with the subsequent clip application.
   CONCLUSIONS: In selected cases, application of a narrower bladed fenestrated mini-clip in the restricted space may be useful to preserve tightly adhering branch arteries, as well as efferent arteries.

TI Perioperative Management of a Patient with Severe Factor V Deficiency
   Presenting with Chronic Subdural Hematoma: A Clinical Report
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Bleeding disorder; Chronic subdural hematoma; Critical care; Factor V
   deficiency
AB BACKGROUND: Severe factor V deficiency is an extremely rare coagulation disorder. Patients with factor V activity <5% usually become symptomatic in early childhood.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report the case of an 82-year-old woman with incidentally diagnosed severe factor V deficiency, who developed a symptomatic chronic subdural hematoma, requiring burr hole craniostomy. Successful management was achieved by a multidisciplinary approach. Preoperatively, factor V activity was increased from 2% to 50% by administration of 25 mL/kg body weight of fresh frozen plasma over 30 minutes under close cardiopulmonary monitoring in the intensive care unit. Straight afterward, the patient was transferred to the operating room where surgery was performed under general anesthesia. Burr hole craniostomy could be performed without perioperative complications. In the postoperative days, there was no relevant recurrence of the subdural hematoma in the follow-up computed tomography scans tinder frequent control of coagulation parameters. However, despite further transfusion of fresh frozen plasma, factor V activity did not increase >16%. The patient was discharged without any neurologic deficits. In a hemostaseologic follow-up 2 months after surgery, factor V activity < 1% was confirmed with evidence of a factor V inhibitor in the modified Bethesda assay. Most likely, the patient suffered from an acquired form of factor V deficiency with preformed antibodies that had been boosted by the initial treatment with fresh frozen plasma.
   CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that in this rare bleeding disorder, intracranial surgery was successfully managed because of a thoroughly planned perioperative therapeutic strategy. However, if there is time prior to surgery, a full checkup of the bleeding disorder is advisable.

TI Vessel Wall Imaging After Subarachnoid Hemorrhage in Patients with
   Multiple Intracranial Aneurysms: A Cautionary Case
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Intracranial aneurysm; Subarachnoid hemorrhage; Vessel wall imaging
ID CEREBRAL VASOCONSTRICTION SYNDROME; MRI; ENHANCEMENT
AB BACKGROUND: Almost 30% of patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) are found to have multiple aneurysms. This can potentially present a serious management dilemma when planning treatment. Magnetic resonance imaging vessel wall imaging (VWI) has been proposed as a reliable technique in differentiating between ruptured and unruptured aneurysms in patients with multiple intracranial aneurysms who present with SAH. Expert consensus now supports this as a possible use for the technique.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Here we present a patient presenting a particular clinical dilemma with SAH and a left third nerve palsy and transient speech disturbance who had circumferential enhancement in the left larger 3.5-mm irregular middle cerebral artery aneurysm and no detectable enhancement in what was angiographically either a 1.5-mm smooth noncompressive left posterior communicating artery aneurysm or infundibulum, but was proved at surgery to be the culprit aneurysm.
   CONCLUSION: Although a case of concurrent false positive and false negative in the same patient has not previously been reported, the positive predictive value of VWI for rupture status is known to be much lower than its negative predictive value, and a case like this might be expected to occur in 0.6% of patients. Therefore, whereas VWI is a valuable tool, it should be used in conjunction with, and not in lieu of, traditional indicators of aneurysm rupture.

TI Intramedullary Schwannoma of Cervical Spinal Cord Presenting
   Inconspicuous Enhancement with Gadolinium
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY

DT Article
DE Intramedullary schwannomas; Magnetic resonance imaging; Spinal cord;
   Surgical resection
ID FEATURES; OUTCOMES; TUMORS
AB BACKGROUND: Intramedullary schwannomas of the spinal cord are extremely rare. Most previous studies are case reports, which have found that intramedullary schwannomas could be homogeneous or asymmetrically enhanced with gadolinium. However, intramedullary schwannomas with minimal enhancement have not been reported.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: This article describes a 34-year-old patient who presented with nonradiative neck pain, progressive weakness of the left limbs, and sensory deficit of both lower extremities. Preoperative examinations such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed, and the patient underwent surgical treatment MRI showed that the lesion presented unsharp enhancement with gadolinium on T1-weighted images. Histopathologic findings were consistent with the diagnosis of schwannoma.
   CONCLUSIONS: We report a case of intramedullary schwannoma that presented inconpicuous enhancement with gadolinium. MRI is useful but cannot be used to differentiate schwannomas from other intramedullary spinal tumours. Surgical resection is the most vital factor for the treatment of intramedullary schwannoma.

   MANAGEMENT; OCCLUSION; FEATURES; PATIENT
AB BACKGROUND: Superior cerebellar artery (SCA) aneurysms can be divided into 2 types: basilar artery (BA)-SCA junction aneurysms and peripheral SCA aneurysms. The peripheral SCA aneurysm is a distinct entity from its BA-SCA counterpart. No comprehensive literature review for endovascular management of peripheral SCA aneurysms has been conducted.
   METHODS: A PubMed search of the published articles written in English was performed on February 13, 2019 for patients who underwent endovascular treatment for peripheral SCA aneurysms. Segmentation of SCA was in accordance with the proposed nomenclature by Rodriguez-Hernandez et al. A modified Rankin Scale score <= 1 was defined as good recovery.
   RESULTS: Thirty-five articles reporting 55 patients including 2 cases in our center were included in the final analysis. The affected patients (28 females, 50.9%) were aged from 3 months to 79 years (46.22 +/- 13.51 years). Forty-five patients (81.8%) presented with spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage with or without cerebellar hematoma. Forty-six patients (83.6%) experienced good recovery. Permanent or transient procedure-related complications occurred in 17/49 patients (34.7%) during endovascular treatment (EVT). However, no fatal or server procedure-related complication occurred in the long-term.
   CONCLUSIONS: Peripheral SCA aneurysms are rare cerebrovascular lesions and should be treated as a specific entity. EVT is an efficient and safe option in peripheral SCA aneurysms. Permanent and fatal procedure-related complications are rare. Further prospective and larger-scale studies are warranted to better elucidate the role of EVT in peripheral SCA aneurysms.

AB We present unique clinical images of jugular bulb dysmaturation (JBD) in an infant with torcular dural sinus malformation (tDSM). Lasjaunias et al hypothesized that the former possess a pivoting role for development of the latter. However, reports about tDSM are extremely rare and lack focus on JBD presence. In this paper we focused on JBD depiction. The combination of magnetic resonance imaging angiography, computed tomography angiography, and digital subtraction angiography imaging of JBD is unique. Moreover, we reviewed current tDSM literature and showed that the presence of JBD in tDSMs correlates significantly with a higher mortality.

AB BACKGROUND: Clearpoint Smartframe is a magnetic resonance imaging - compatible stereotactic system often used to perform magnetic resonance imaging - guided biopsies. The system is typically mounted on the scalp through screws that pierce the skin and penetrate the outer table of the cranium. However, the frame can also be configured to be mounted directly onto the skull.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Here, we describe the clinical context well suited Tor a skull-mount Clearpoint Smartframe surgery. The patient suffered from a subcentimeter right parafourth ventricular contrast-enhancing lesion with hydrocephalus and underwent a right suboccipital needle biopsy followed by an occipital ventriculoperitoneal shunt. Although the hydrocephalus resolved with the ventriculoperitoneal shunt, the biopsy sample proved nondiagnostic. The patient underwent a second procedure during which the Clearpoint Smartframe was mounted onto the skull through space dissected free during the previous surgery. Diagnostic biopsy (H3K27 glioma) was performed followed by stereotactic laser ablation of the lesion.
   CONCLUSIONS: We describe a case in which the skull mount Cleat, oint Smartframe was used to biopsy and ablate a midline H3K27 glioma.

DT Article
DE Intracranial; Penetrating foreign body; Superior sagittal sinus
ID INJURY
AB BACKGROUND: The incidence of penetrating intracranial foreign bodies is and to date, not many relevant studies have been published worldwide. In particular, a nail penetrating intracranially, just near the superior sagittal sinus (SSS), is extremely rare. We treated the case of a large nail that penetrated the middle of the head and strategized its removal.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 70-year-old man had experienced headache lasting a day. Computed tomography of the brain revealed a nail penetrating the middle of his head; in particular, the tip of the nail had penetrated the right ventricle, causing a slight subarachnoid hemorrhage. Angiography showed that the nail was very close to the SSS and that the venous flow was normal. However, there was a risk of the nail penetrating through the SSS or injuring other arteries, and we removed the nail directly from the intracranial view to stop bleeding from the SSS or other vessels. Fortunately, there was no bleeding, and we washed the hole created by the nail penetration and concluded the surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our technique is useful and safe for removing large nails penetrating the head.

ID HEMORRHAGE
AB Background: Schizencephaly is a rare congenital central nervous system malformation characterized by linear, thickened clefts of the cerebral mantle. Recently, germline mutations in collagen type IV alpha 1 (COL4A1) have been reported to be a genetic cause of schizencephaly as a result of prenatal stroke. Patients with COL4A1 mutation demonstrate a variety of disease phenotypes. However, little is known about the potential complications of patients with COL4A1 mutations before and after neurologic surgery.
   Case Description: A 9-month-old boy with schizencephaly and a congenital cataract underwent a ventriculoperitoneal shunt for progressive hydrocephalus. Postoperatively, he developed malignant hyperthermia and cerebral venous thrombosis. Early treatment with dantrolene sodium and hydration was effective. Genetic testing revealed a germline COL4A1 mutation.
   CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, malignant hyperthermia and cerebral venous thrombosis have not been reported in the literature in patients with COL4A1 mutations after surgery. Schizencephaly arising from COL4A1 mutations might be a disease prone to these adverse effects because this mutation is known to be associated with venous tortuosity, venous vulnerability, and muscle spasms due to basement membrane protein abnormalities. We need to better understand the wide spectrum of clinical phenotypes of COL4A1 mutations and potential complications in order to better manage surgery of patients with schizencephaly.

AB OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to conduct a meta-analysis to identify the risk factors for formation of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients after spine surgery.
   METHODS: This study retrieved potential academic articles on the related factors for VTE formation in patients after spine surgery from MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library. The reference articles for the identified studies were carefully reviewed to ensure that all available documents were represented in the study.
   RESULTS: A total of 21 articles (20 retrospective studies and 1 prospective study) involving 2,870,105 patients were identified in the analysis, including 7829 patients who presented with VIE after spine surgery; the incidence of VTE was 0.273%. Our meta-analysis showed that compared with patients who did not have VTE after spine surgery, there was significantly more blood loss (weighted mean difference [WMD], 93.295; 95% confidence interval [CI], 60.521-126.069; P< 0.001), higher age (WMD, 6.011; 95% CI, 3.647-9.376; P < 0.001), thoracolumbar surgery (odds ratio [013], 0233; 95% CI, 0.198-0.274; P < 0.001), and longer duration of surgery (WMD, 45.672; 95% CI, 10.433 to -80.911; P = 0.011) among the patients with VTE. Patients with a history of hypertension (OR, 1.785; 95% CI, 1.516-2.103; P < 0.001), diabetes (OR, 1.535; 95% CI, 1.286-1.832; P < 0.001), and preoperative walking disability (OR, 4.882; 95% CI, 2.044-11.663; P < 0.001) showed a significantly higher rate of VTE after spine surgery. However, no significant differences were found in gender (P = 0.289), fusion surgery (P = 0.979), body mass index (P = 0.157), history of heart disease (P = 0.397), and level of D-dimer (P = 0.220).
   CONCLUSIONS: A higher rate of postoperative VTE is closely associated with the elderly, longer duration of surgery, thoracolumbar surgery, greater blood loss, and patients with a history of hypertension, preoperative walking disability, or diabetes after spinal surgery; these risk factors should be guarded against.

   ENTRAPMENT; COMPLICATIONS; SURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: Several authors have reported the occurrence of extra-foraminal L5 nerve root compression between lumbosacral transitional vertebrae (LSTV) and sacral ala, but reports on a lesion caused by an intervertebral osteophyte on the ventral and contralateral side of a unilateral abnormality by LSTV are hardly available.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 67-year-old woman presented with pain along the distribution of the L5 nerve root; straight leg raise test, femoral nerve stretch test, and Kemp test were positive on the left. Following plain radiographs, computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and selective nerve root block, an osteophyte bridging the L5 and S1 vertebral bodies in the ventral side was identified compressing the L5 nerve root. On account of resistance to conservative therapy and the delicate position of the lesion, surgical treatment was performed by an anterior decompression. Subsequently, the patient attained adequate relief from pain and could walk normally.
   CONCLUSION: We herein present a very rare case of extraforaminal L5 nerve root compression caused by an intervertebral osteophyte on the ventral and contralateral side of a unilateral abnormality by LSTV, which was managed by anterior decompression.

TI An Extended Endoscopic Endonasal Approach for Sellar Area
   Chondrosarcoma: A Case Report and Literature Review
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Review
DE Chondrosarcoma; Neuroendoscopy; Sellar area
ID SKULL BASE; INTRACRANIAL CHONDROSARCOMA
AB BACKGROUND: Chondrosarcoma is a malignant tumor that originates from mesenchymal cells that have differentiated into chondrocytes, often growing laterally, rarely seen in the cranium, and seldom seen in the saddle area. We believe that only a few cases have been reported in the literature. We report a case of pituitary fossa chondrosarcoma, which was completely resected by an extended endoscopic endonasal approach, and a literature review.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 20-year-old man was admitted to hospital with bilateral temporal headache and blurred vision, without any history of sexual dysfunction or diabetes insipidus. Endocrine function was normal. Computed tomography of the head showed calcified sellar lesions and sellar bone destruction, which were closely associated with the right cavernous sinus. Magnetic resonance imaging showed saddle area space-occupying lesions, with low signal on the T1-weighted image and high signal on the T2-weighted image, uneven enhancement by enhanced scanning, and unclear pituitary display. The tumor was completely resected by an extended endoscopic endonasal approach and confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging. Postoperative pathology revealed conventional chondrosarcoma (World Health Organization grade II). Postsurgical visual acuity also improved. The patient did not receive radiotherapy or chemotherapy. No recurrence was found at 10-month follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: Sellar region chondrosarcoma is rare. For space-occupying lesions in this area, chondrosarcoma should be considered and not necessarily pituitary adenoma, craniopharyngioma, meningioma, and chordoma. The extended endoscopic endonasal approach represents a good treatment option for sellar area chondrosarcoma.

SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY

DE Cerebral aneurysm; Oculomotor nerve; Subarachnoid hemorrhage; True
   posterior communicating artery aneurysm
ID MICROSURGICAL ANATOMY
AB BACKGROUND: In most cases, the posterior communicating artery (PCoA) lies medial to the oculomotor nerve. In this report, a rare case of a ruptured cerebral aneurysm arising from a variant PCoA lying lateral to the oculomotor nerve is described.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 41-year-old woman who had a history of surgical clipping of a right PCoA aneurysm 13 years earlier developed a subarachnoid hemorrhage due to a ruptured left true PCoA aneurysm. Three-dimensional computed tomography angiography showed a small saccular aneurysm arising from the PCoA itself. She underwent surgical clipping via a left frontotemporal craniotomy. Interestingly, the PCoA lay lateral to the oculomotor nerve, and the aneurysm dome projected medially and compressed the oculomotor nerve medially. A slightly angled fenestrated miniclip was applied across the PCoA, followed by reconstruction of the PCoA medial wall and simultaneous obliteration of the aneurysm. Complete aneurysm obliteration and good patency of both the PCoA and perforating arteries were confirmed intraoperatively by indocyanine green videoangiography. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged with no neurologic deficits.
   CONCLUSIONS: Recognizing this anatomic variant is helpful in minimizing the potential complications in microsurgical management around the PCoA and oculomotor nerve. Lateral localization of the P1-2 junction might affect this rare anatomic variant.

ID SPINAL MENINGITIDES; RADICULOMYELOPATHY; MEDULLARIS; INFECTIONS
AB BACKGROUND: Although tuberculosis is rare in the west, in recent years, it's becoming more and more common in China. Intraspinal tuberculoma is extremely rare, but it's an important cause of morbidity. Magnetic resonance imaging scanning is an effective method for the diagnosis of intraspinal tuberculoma.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: This case report shows an intraspinal tuberculoma with paraspinal abscesses in a 28-year-old female patient with subacute progressing neurologic deficit. L1-L5 laminectomy was performed, followed by extensively excision of intraspinal and paraspinal lesion. Antituberculous treatment was carried out after pathologic diagnosis. An excellent clinical outcome was obtained. Within 24 hours of the surgical procedure, muscle weakness in both lower extremities started to improve. Three days later, the patient felt muscle strength recovered significantly, with grade 4/5 in the lower limbs in 2 weeks. Six weeks later, the patient was able to walk without assistance.
   CONCLUSIONS: The case was treated by surgical excision of an intraspinal a paraspinal lesion followed by normal quadruple antituberculous therapy. Although intraspinal tuberculoma is a rare entity, it can be effectively diagnosed on the basis of magnetic resonance imaging scanning and treated by the combination of medical and surgical treatments.

AB The aim of present report was to briefly review the history of the anatomical studies during the Italian Renaissance and to outline their relationship to the figurative arts, focusing, in particular, on neuroanatomical studies that have been at the center of the medical and philosophical debate from the 14th to 16th centuries. Therefore, we have presented the interpretation of different Renaissance masterpieces for which some references to brain anatomy have been previously reported. We propose a new interpretation, in neuroanatomical key, of the fresco of the universal judgment in the vault of San Giorgio's Cathedral in Ferrara, Italy, painted around the end of the 16th century.

DT Article
DE Froin syndrome; Intrathecal drug therapy; Spinal cord injury;
   Xanthochromia
AB BACKGROUND: Froin syndrome is characterized by xanthochromia and hy-percoagulability of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) due to elevated protein levels. This entity results from blockage of the spinal canal by a mass lesion leading to an isolated caudal CSF space.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 48-year-old male, who developed spasticity after a C6 Spinal cord injury (SCI) 20 years earlier, presented with subobstruction of his intrathecal baclofen pump. A catheter access port aspiration revealed an extremely high protein concentration (38 g/L) with no signs of infection. Froin syndrome was confirmed when magnetic resonance imaging showed a complete obstruction of the spinal canal at the SCI level.
   CONCLUSIONS: We report the first case of Froin syndrome after SCI. Froin syndrome can impact intrathecal drug delivery and CSF diagnostics.

AB The indications for mechanical thrombectomy (MT) have expanded since the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association reported its first guidelines for MT in 2013. Multiple subsequent randomized clinical trials of MT have proved its efficacy, including the DAWN (DWI [diffusion weighted imaging] or CTP [computed tomography perfusion] Assessment with Clinical Mismatch in the Triage of Wake-ttp and Late Presenting Strokes Undergoing Neuro-intervention with Trevo) and DEFUSE-3 (Endovascular Therapy Following Imaging Evaluation for Ischemic Stroke-3) trials. The current guidelines from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association provide class I support for the use of MT for the following indications: 1) internal carotid artery (ICA)/M1 middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion, symptom onset <6 hours, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score of >= 6, Alberta Stroke Program Early Computed Tomography Score of >= 6; and 2) large vessel occlusions in the anterior circulation, symptom onset 6-16 hours, and meeting the DAWN or DEFUSE-3 eligibility criteria. Class Ila evidence is also available for the use of MT for large vessel occlusions in the anterior circulation, symptom onset 16-24 hours, and meeting other DAWN eligibility criteria. In clinical practice, these class I and Ila indications for MT have been well followed. However, many other potential indications are available, including 1) M2 or M3 MCA occlusion, symptom onset <6 hours; 2) Alberta Stroke Program Early Computed Tomography Score <6, ICA or M1 MCA occlusion, symptom onset <6 hours; 3) National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score <6, ICA or M1 occlusion, symptom onset <6 hours; 4) tandem occlusions; and 5) posterior circulation occlusion <6 hours. The present review analyzed the available data to provide support for further prospective clinical trials regarding these potential indications.

AB BACKGROUND: Myelopathy develops relatively rarely in intracranial dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF); it has only been reported in posterior cranial fossa DAVE Herein, we report the first, to our knowledge, case of anterior cranial fossa (ACF) DAVF with myelopathy.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 75-year-old man presented with dizziness, nausea, and gait disturbance. T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging revealed a hyperintense area in the left cerebellum and medulla; a flow void was also detected around the medulla. The patient was first diagnosed with spinal DAVF, but the shunt point was detected at the anterior ethmoidal artery, flowing from the olfactory vein to the basal vein of Rosenthal and anterior/posterior spinal veins. The shunt point was clipped during craniotomy, and neurologic symptoms improved.
   CONCLUSIONS: Myelopathy because of intracranial DAVF potentially involves diagnostic pitfalls. Even in ACF DAVF, there is a possibility of myelopathy caused by perimedullary venous drainage.

   TREATMENT; LENNOX-GASTAUT; ANTERIOR; SECTION
AB BACKGROUND: Progressive myoclonic epilepsy (PME) is a syndrome characterized by development of progressive myoclonus, cognitive impairment, and other neurologic deficits. Despite major advances in medical treatment of epilepsy, some PME patients remain refractory to antiepileptic drugs. This may further accentuate cognitive impairment and deteriorate functional capacity. Corpus callosotomy (CC) is used in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy who are not candidates for either excisional epilepsy surgery or neurostimulation. We report the application of the standard complete callosotomy to control medically refractory status epilepticus in a patient with PME.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 16-year-old boy was referred to the emergency department with generalized tonic-clonic seizures. He was known to have PME since 5 years earlier, with frequent generalized seizures requiring hospitalization and reloading of the drugs. The patient was discussed by the epilepsy surgery working group, and corpus callosotomy was considered as a last resort to control the refractory status epilepticus. The patient experienced no generalized seizures during the 3-month postoperative period (Engel class IIIB).
   CONCLUSIONS: Inasmuch as surgery was the last resort to control severe disabling status epilepticus, because most of the epileptogenic discharges were originating from the parieto-occipital regions and profound cognitive impairment was present, we decided to perform a complete rather than just an anterior callosotomy. CC may be considered to prevent secondary generalized seizures as the most disabling attacks in patients with certain epilepsy syndromes. Nevertheless, the impact of palliative surgical intervention on the overall disease course of patients with an underlying diffuse pathologic state remains to be determined.

ID INFLAMMATION; INTERLEUKIN-6
AB BACKGROUND: The presence of an anterior communicating artery blister-like aneurysm in the setting of a craniopharyngioma has never been reported to our knowledge.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: This patient was admitted to our service for an untreated craniopharyngioma resection. An anterior interhemispheric approach with right frontal craniotomy was performed and a blister-like aneurysm of the anterior communicating artery was found during the surgery. After the tumor was completely resected, a suturing technique was used for the aneurysm. In this article, we are going to present this rare case and discuss the potential pathogeny of the aneurysm.
   CONCLUSIONS: We hypothesized that cystic craniopharyngioma may rupture spontaneously. The cystic fluid accumulated in the lower subarachnoid space due to gravity, and it may lead to local vascular cytotoxic and inflammatory reactions which may result in the vascular wall remodeling and lead to the reconstructed vascular wall weakness.

AB BACKGROUND: Trigeminal schwannomas are fifth cranial nerve tumors that originate from the nerve sheath. They rarely occur within the pediatric population and can cause dysfunction of the trigeminal nerve and surrounding structures. When patients become symptomatic, neurosurgeons should consider resection.
   CASE DESRIPTION: We report the case of a 14-year-old adolescent boy who presented with an isolated sixth nerve palsy manifested by diplopia. The patient was found to have a trigeminal schwannoma involving the ophthalmic and maxillary branches of the trigeminal nerve. A modified mini-pterional craniotomy was performed for an extended middle fossa approach with an anterior petrosectomy to gain access to the inferior aspect of the posterior fossa tumor component. Intraoperatively, the sixth nerve was compressed within Dorello's canal. Postoperatively, the patient's sixth nerve palsy resolved, and magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated near-total resection with residual enhancement along the superior orbital fissure near the oculomotor nerve entry zone and foramen rotundum.
   CONSLUSIONS: We present a rare case of pediatric trigeminal schwannoma Mp treated surgically with a near-total resection via a novel mini-pterional approach and use of cranial nerve diffusion tensor imaging.

DE Extracranial meningioma; Hypoglossal canal; Transcondylar approach
ID CRANIOVERTEBRAL JUNCTION; MORPHOMETRIC-ANALYSIS
AB BACKGROUND: Primary extracranial meningiomas are uncommon neoplasms. In particular, meningioma involving the hypoglossal canal is extremely rare, with only 4 cases reported in the literature so far. Given that each of these meningiomas originated in the juxtacondyle region with involvement of the hypoglossal canal, to the best of our knowledge, a meningioma that exists only within the hypoglossal canal has yet to be reported.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a case of primary extracranial meningioma arising solely From the hypoglossal canal. A 62-year-old woman presented with long-term difficulty in tongue movement Her tongue was deviated to the right, and neurologic examination revealed fasciculation and muscle wasting on the right side of the tongue. Computed tomography revealed a calcification in the right hypoglossal canal. Magnetic resonance imaging further demonstrated a hypointense tumor on both T1-weighted and T2-weighted images, with contrast enhancement in the right condyle. Total tumor removal was performed via a transcondylar approach, and histopathologic examination confirmed the presence of a transitional meningioma. No recurrence was observed at 14 months of follow-up. The patient's tongue atrophy was slightly improved, and the deviation completely disappeared.
   CONCLUSIONS: In this extremely rare case of hypoglossal canal meningioma total tumor removal via a transcondylar approach resulted in the recovery of hypoglossal nerve function.

   OBSTRUCTIVE HYDROCEPHALUS; DIVERTICULA; VENTRICLE; SEQUENCE; MRI
AB BACKGROUND: Triventricular hydrocephalus is caused by an obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid flow causing increased intracranial pressure (ICP). Common treatment options include ventricular shunting or endoscopic third ventriculocisternostomy. Spontaneous third ventriculocisternostomy is a rare phenomenon in patients with obstructive triventricular hydrocephalus. We present the case of a patient with triventricular hydrocephalus and evidence of spontaneous third ventriculocisternostomy.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 33-year-old female patient was referred to our outpatient clinic for triventricular hydrocephalus diagnosed on imaging. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of her brain showed a triventricular obstructive hydrocephalus owing to a possible aqueductal stenosis. No clinical or diagnostic signs of elevated ICP were present. Repeat imaging showed no changes in cerebral ventricular size and MRI flow imaging demonstrated flow voids in the third ventricle extending through the floor of the third ventricle to the prepontine cistern. We concluded that the cause of hydrocephalus was likely to be a compensated aqueductal stenosis.
   CONCLUSIONS: Spontaneous third ventriculocisternostomy is seen in patients with chronic hydrocephalus. MRI sensitive to flow artefacts can be useful in the diagnosis of patients with apparent compensated hydrocephalus, and phase-contrast imaging can prove cerebrospinal fluid flow across the stoma. Resolution of symptoms owing to elevated ICP is regularly observed in patients with a spontaneous ventriculocisternostomy.

AB BACKGROUND: Idiopathic hypertrophic pachymeningitis is a rare inflammatory condition with diffuse thickening of the dura mater, which may cause a compressive effect or vascular compromise.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 40-year-old Chinese man presented with persistent headache for 5 months and a sudden epileptic seizure 2 days ago. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a large (71 x 34 x 27 mm) extra-axial mass at the right frontal convexity with severe edema mimicking meningioma. The lesion and peripheral dura mater showed contrast enhancement. Additionally, the skull near the lesion was eroded. Meningioma was diagnosed, and the patient underwent surgery. During the operation, we found the lesion texture was very tough, and the superior sagittal sinus was occluded. Histopathologic findings revealed a large number of infiltrated lymphocytes with fibrosis and microabscess formation; intracranial idiopathic hypertrophic pachymeningitis was diagnosed. Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging performed 3 months after surgery demonstrated the enhancement was notably alleviated.
   CONCLUSIONS: Idiopathic hypertrophic pachymeningitis should be part of the differential diagnosis of some cases of meningioma.

AB BACKGROUND: In conjunction with Vietnam's unparaleled economic growth over the past 20 years, our scope of neurosurgical interventions has considerably diversified throughout this time period.
   METHODS: Although still appreciably limited, health-resources and infrastructure have expanded and shifted the focus within neurosurgery at Ho Chi Minh City's Cho Ray Hospital from head trauma (which remains highly prevalent) to an equal proportion of elective cases for vascular lesions, tumors, and degenerative spine disease. Arguably the most significant progress throughout the new millennium has been achieved in the realm of neurosurgical oncology.
   RESULTS: About 1000 craniotomies are performed annually for brain tumors at our institution, most of which are for lower-grade lesions that result in excellent surgical outcomes. We continue to strive to improve the standard of care for patients with malignant brain tumors, as the first multidisciplinary neuro-oncology care team was founded recently in 2016.
   CONCLUSIONS: This article is the first in the English nerosurgical literature to report on the current state and outcomes of neuro-oncology in Vietnam, as we highlight our experiences in caring for patients with brain tumors at Cho Ray Hospital.

AB Patients with complex, multisutural, and syndromic craniosynostosis (CSO) frequently exhibit intracranial hypertension. The intracranial hypertension cannot be entirely attributed to the craniocephalic disproportion with calvarial restriction because cranial vault expansion has not consistently alleviated elevated intracranial pressure. Evidence has most strongly supported a multi-factorial interaction, including venous hypertension along with other pathogenic processes. Patients with CSO exhibit marked venous anomalies, including stenosis of the jugular-sigmoid complex, transverse sinuses, and extensive transosseous venous collaterals. These abnormal intracranial-extracranial occipital venous collaterals might represent anomalous development, with persistence and subsequent enlargement of channels normally present in the fetus, either as a primary defect or as nonregression in response to failure of the development of the jugular-sigmoid complexes. It has been suggested by some investigators that venous hypertension in patients with CSO could be treated directly via jugular foraminoplasty, venous stenting, or jugular venous bypass, although these options are not in common clinical practice. Obstructive sleep apnea, occurring as a consequence of midface hypoplasia, can also contribute to intracranial hypertension in patients with syndromic CSO. Thus, correction of facial deformities, as well as posterior fossa decompression, could also play important roles in the treatment of intracranial hypertension. Determining the precise mechanistic underpinnings underlying intracranial hypertension in any given patient with CSO requires individualized evaluation and management.

DE Endovascular treatment; Middle cerebral aneurysms; Ruptured; Single-arm
ID INTRACRANIAL ANEURYSMS; COILING; OUTCOMES
AB OBJECTIVE: The use of endovascular treatment for ruptured middle cerebral artery (MCA) aneurysms, which have been more likely to be recommended for neurosurgical clipping because of the complex anatomic configuration, remains controversial. In the present study, the angiographic and clinical outcomes of endovascularly treated ruptured MCA aneurysms were systematically reviewed.
   METHODS: Online databases, including Cochrane, Medline, Web of Science, and Embase, were retrospectively and systematically searched. The primary outcomes were the immediate complete occlusion rate, mortality, complication-related mortality, and procedure-related complication rate. Meta-analysis was performed using a random or fixed effect model based on heterogeneity.
   RESULTS: A total of 14 studies with 1004 ruptured MCA aneurysms were included. The procedure-related mortality rate at discharge was 1.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.9%-2.7%; I-2 = 0.0%; P = 0.623). The favorable clinical outcome rate at discharge was 65.4% (95% CI, 54.8%-76.0%; I-2 = 94.2%; P < 0.001) and had progressively increased to 73.2% (95% CI, 59.9%-86.5%; I-2 = 80.9%; P < 0.001). The overall complication rate was 22.7% (95% CI, 15.1%-30.3%; I-2 = 75.5%; P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSION: Endovascular treatment of MCA aneurysms was related to a high incidence of procedure-related complications but a low rate of procedure-related mortality. The overall angiographic and clinical outcomes were comparable and warrant further investigation comparing clipping versus coiling for ruptured MCA aneurysms.

   TISSUE ADHESIVE; RISK-FACTORS
AB BACKGROUND: Sealants are often used in spine surgery to prevent postoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage.
   OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy of sealants in preventing postoperative CSF leakage in spine surgery.
   METHODS: The PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched for articles reporting the outcome of patients treated with a sealant for spinal dural repair. The number of patients, indication of surgery, surgical site, applied technique, type of sealant used, and outcome in terms of postoperative CSF leakage were noted for each study. The primary outcome was CSF leakage in general and secondary outcome infection.
   RESULTS: Forty-one articles were selected with a total of 2542 cases; there were 4 comparative studies with 540 sealed cases and 343 cases with primary suture closure only. The quantity of CSF leakage did not differ between the sealant group (50 of 540, 9.1%) and the group treated with sutures only (48 of 343, 13.8%) (risk ratio [RR], 0.58 [confidence interval [CI], 0.18-1.82]). The infection rate did also not differ between the sealant and primary suture groups (RR, 0.94 [Cl, 0.55-1.60. This result was found in both the intended and the unintended durotomy subgroups. Secondary analysis of all cases showed that endoscopic or minimally invasive surgery had lower CSF leakage rates compared with open surgery regardless of sealant use (RR, 0.18 [CI, 0.05-0.75]).
   CONCLUSIONS: Currently available sealants seem not to reduce the rate of CSF leakage in spine surgery. In endoscopic and minimally invasive surgery, the CSF leakage rate is less frequent compared with open, conventional surgery regardless of sealant use.

AB BACKGROUND: Robotic guidance (RG) and navigation (NV) have been shown to reduce radiologic and clinically relevant pedicle screw malpositions. It remains unknown if there are any additional benefits to these techniques in intraoperative and perioperative end points.
   METHODS: We conducted a systematic review in MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library and identified controlled studies comparing RG, NV, and freehand (FH) thoracolumbar pedicle screw insertion and carried out random-effects meta-analyses.
   RESULTS: Thirty-two studies (24,008 patients) were included. Only 8 studies (26%) were randomized, and study quality was rated as very low or low in 24 cases (77%). Compared with NV, FH procedures showed longer length of hospital stay (Delta, 0.7 days; 95% confidence interval, 0.2-1.2; P = 0.006) and more overall complications (odds ratio, 1.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-1.9; P < 0.001). No statistically significant differences among RG and FH were identified, likely because of lack in statistical power (all P> 0.05). In particular, both RG and NV did not show increased intraoperative radiation use, as determined by seconds of fluoroscopy, compared with FH (both P > 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: It seems that navigation may offer potential benefits in perioperative outcomes such as length of hospital stay and overall complications, without significant increase in intraoperative radiation, which cannot yet be said for robotic guidance. The findings must be interpreted with caution, because the evidence is severely limited in both quantity and quality. Further evaluation will establish any demonstrable intraoperative or perioperative benefits to computer assistance, which may warrant the high costs often associated with these devices.

AB BACKGROUND: Current literature remains inconclusive as to whether multilevel posterior cervical fusions (PCFs) involving the C7 vertebra should cross the cervicothoracic junction (CTJ). The objective of this systematic review was to assess the differences in clinical outcomes, fusion, and reoperation rates, between patients undergoing multilevel PCFs ending at C7 and those undergoing PCF crossing the CTJ.
   METHODS: A systematic review of literature from 4 databases on crossing the CTJ was conducted. Inclusion criteria consisted of 1) patients undergoing multilevel PCF or combined anterior and PCF involving C7, 2) diagnosis for surgery being degenerative disk or deformity.
   RESULTS: Six studies consisting of 530 patients were included in this review. Two were 1-arm studies and 4 were comparative studies. There were 305 patients (58%) in the noncrossing group and 225 patients (42%) in the crossing group. Among the 3 comparative studies that recorded fusion rate, patients in the crossing group were more likely to achieve fusion (odds ratio, 2.75; 95% confidence interval, 1.61-4.09; P < 0.001) and were less likely to undergo a reoperation (odds ratio, 0.42; 95% confidence interval, 0.25-0.73; P = 0.002) compared with patients in the noncrossing group. In our indirect analyses, fusion rate and reoperation rate were comparable between the 2 groups (P = 0.689 and P = 0.714, respectively).
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that based on current evidence, multilevel PCFs that cross the CTJ may have higher fusion rates and lower reoperation rates compared with fusions that stop at C7. These results are important to assist the surgeon in decision making regarding the lower instrumented level when performing a multilevel PCF.

AB BACKGROUND: Minimally invasive transforaminal interbody fusion (MIS-TLIF) has been shown to have excellent outcomes for surgical management of degenerative disc disease. However, the challenge is in addressing coronal imbalance and restoring lumbar lordosis and sagittal alignment. Use of expandable cages in MIS-TLIF has been hypothesized to circumvent this disadvantage. An indirect meta-analysis of the evidence is presented comparing outcomes from expandable cages with those from nonexpandable cages, in patients undergoing MIS-TLIF.
   METHODS: PRISMA guidelines were used to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the clinical and radiologic outcomes of expandable cages and nonexpandable cages in patients undergoing MIS-TLIF.
   RESULTS: Twelve studies (706 patients) were included in the meta-analysis. The mean increase in disc height was found to be significantly greater for the nonexpandable cages group than for the expandable cages group (1.33 mm; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.28-1.38 vs. 1.14 mm,; 95% CI, 1.06-1.23; P < 0.001). No significant difference was found regarding change in lumbar lordosis at last follow-up between the 2 groups (P = 0.34). The mean change in segmental lordosis was found to be significantly higher for the expandable cage group (5.04 , 95% CI, 3.89-6.20 vs. 2.08', 95% Cl, 1.93-2.22; P < 0.001). We did not detect any significant difference in fusion rate (P = 0.33), subsidence rate (P = 0.41) or in reoperations (P = 0.56) at last follow-up between the 2 groups.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that there may not be a significant difference in clinical and radiologic parameters between expandable cages and nonexpandable cages among patients undergoing MIS-TLIF, and it is unclear if the higher cost of the expandable cages is justified.

   COMPLICATIONS; ADVANTAGES; MORBIDITY; LESS; BIAS
AB BACKGROUND: Frame-based stereotaxy has generally been considered the reference standard for brain biopsies. However, frameless stereotaxy might expedite the efficiency of the clinical work flow. Conflicting findings have been reported regarding the relative efficacy and safety of frame-based and frameless needle biopsy of brain lesions. We performed a meta-analysis of the reported data to compare the relative efficacy, safety, and time efficiency of frame-based and frameless stereotactic needle biopsy.
   METHODS: The PubMed database was searched for studies comparing frame-based and frameless biopsy. Of the 5248 reports found, 15 were included in the present meta-analysis.
   RESULTS: The 15 studies included in the present meta-analysis included 2400 patients. Our analysis found no statistically significant differences between frame-based and frameless biopsy in the diagnostic yield (odds ratio [OR], 1.01; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.71-1.41), morbidity (OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.76-1.66), mortality (OR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.40-2.17), postbiopsy hemorrhage (OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.68-1.96), and postbiopsy neurological deficit (OR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.62-1.65). The results from our integrated analysis indicated that frameless biopsies are associated with a shorter procedural time relative to frame-based biopsy (standard difference in the mean, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.24-1.04; P = 0.002; I-2 [Higgins inconsistency index] = 86.66%).
   CONCLUSIONS: The results from our meta-analysis suggest no significant differences exist between frame-based and frameless biopsy in diagnostic yield, morbidity, and mortality. Frameless biopsy is associated with shorter procedural times relative to frame-based biopsy. We have also discussed the relative merits of frame-based and frameless biopsies.

ID AGGRESSIVE RESECTION; VOLUMETRIC-ANALYSIS; NONELOQUENT AREAS; SURGERY;
   CONTRAST; EXTENT; GRADE; GLIOMAS; FLUORESCENCE; PREDICTION
AB BACKGROUND: Gross total resection (GTR) of the contrast enhancing (CE) area will improve the survival of patients with glioblastoma (GBM). However, GBM can infiltrate into the brain parenchyma, beyond the CE margins. It remains unclear whether resection beyond the CE area (supratotal resection [SPTR]) can improve survival without causing additional neurological deficits. The aim of the present meta-analysis was to study the association between SPTR and overall survival of patients of GBM.
   METHODS: Embase, PubMed, and other literature databases were searched for eligible studies until August 2018. Studies involving patients with GBM that had compared SPTR with GTR were included in the present study. The main outcome was overall survival, presented as hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (Cis) and median overall survival differences with the 95% CIs.
   RESULTS: The meta-analysis, which included 6 studies and 1168 unique patients with GBM, showed that compared with GTR, SPTR of GBM resulted in a 53% lower risk of mortality at any time during follow-up (HR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.31-0.72; P = 0.0005). The median overall survival of the SPTR group was 6.4 months (95% CI, 3.2-9.7) longer than the GTR group (P = 0.0001). Reports on postoperative deficits were limited, and the quality of evidence was moderate to very low.
   CONCLUSIONS: Compared with GTR, SPTR of GBM resulted in a lower risk of mortality and longer median overall survival. However, the quality of evidence of the available studies was poor. Therefore, it remains unclear whether SPTR is safe and actually improves the survival of patients with GBM. Future prospective trials and a standardized definition of SPTR are needed.

ID PRIMARY CNS LYMPHOMA
AB BACKGROUND: Relapse of primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma (PCNSL) occurs primarily at the initial site. Relapse outside the CNS is rare.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present the case of a 62-year-old immunocompetent man who underwent a stereotactic biopsy to diagnose PCNSL and subsequent placement of ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) for symptom relief in November 2012. He got complete remission after 6 cycles of high-dose methotrexate-based chemotherapy. In August 2017, relapse of lymphoma occurred in the abdomen, left basal ganglia, and bilateral ventricle with the largest lesion being around the VPS in the abdomen. He got complete remission after 6 cycles of R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, vincristine and prednisolone) plus 8 cycles of high-dose methotrexate chemotherapy.
   CONCLUSIONS: Here we report the first case of extra-CNS relapse of PCNSL around the site of VPS in the abdomen after intensive chemotherapy. Neuro-surgeons should be aware of a potential risk of PCNSL spread along the VPS.

TI Cerebral Granuloma Mimicking Malignant Neoplasm in Patient with Seizures
   21 Years After Head Trauma
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Granuloma; Neoplasm; Surgery; Trauma
ID BRAIN-INJURY
AB BACKGROUND: Chronic posttraumatic cerebral granuloma is a rare, delayed complication of traumatic brain injury. Because of its late onset of symptoms and atypical appearance, the correct diagnosis of this rare lesion is difficult.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 49-year-old man presented with seizures, which occurred 21 years after open right forehead trauma. Imaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopy, which indicated a malignant neoplasm, revealed a mass lesion on the right frontal lobe, invading the dura and partial frontal bone. The patient underwent total removal of the lesion and titanium mesh cranioplasty, simultaneously, due to invasion of the mass lesion into the skull. However, the postoperative histopathologic diagnosis was chronic inflammatory granuloma. At 1-year follow-up, he did not have any discomfort and epilepsy did not recur.
   CONCLUSIONS: Chronic cerebral granuloma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a novel or recurrent mass detected in patients with a history of traumatic brain injury or prior surgery. Moreover, the retained foreign bodies in the superficial or nonfunctional area of the brain should be thoroughly examined and removed at the time of injury, particularly in open brain trauma.

ID RISK-FACTORS; CALCIUM-PHOSPHATE; SULFATE
AB BACKGROUND: Percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) is effective in treating osteoprotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs). Intervertebral bridging ossification can sometimes be detected after surgery, but studies related to its formation mechanism and its influence on outcome are few.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We reviewed patients' radiologic images and found 7 patients in whom intervertebral bridging ossification developed after PKP Their personal and clinical information was recorded. The 7 patients had an average age of 63.43 +/- 4.79 years. Injured levels included L1 (1 patients) and L2 (1 patient). GeneX and PMMA cement were respectively applied. Both the Cobb angle and the VAS scores were significantly improved after surgery, but all surgical vertebrae showed recollapse combined with larger Cobb angle at the last follow-up visits. In 1 patient the new-onset T11 fracture developed 29 months after surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: We deemed that spinal degeneration, mechanical instability, bone cement, and fracture pattern are all potential promoting factors for intervertebral bridging ossification. Solid bridging ossification may increase local spinal stability, but it also increases the risk of adjacent vertebral fractures.

AB In previous decades, extensive and disfiguring transfacial and/or transcranial approaches were used to reach the sellar and parasellar areas. However, these surgical routes were burdened by severe complications and high mortality rates. Recently, the development of endoscopic endonasal techniques has revolutionized the surgical strategies for approaching the sella and adjacent areas and increased the development of transsphenoidal surgery. With these techniques, surgeons have been able to overcome the visual limitations of the open surgical approaches and access areas previously hidden from view. After the contributions of the Pittsburgh duo, Carrau and Jho, pioneers of pure endoscopic surgery, our school began to implement this technique, introducing technical innovations and variations, describing the anatomical details and defining new routes, and playing a key role in its widespread clinical application.

AB Pituitary tumors are a heterogeneous group of lesions (usually benign) and proper understanding of the anatomy, physiology, and pathology of the hypothalamic/pituitary region is essential to make an accurate diagnosis and define the essential treatment options (i.e., surgery, medical therapies, and radiotherapy, alone or in combination). Surgery is the primary treatment for acromegaly, Cushing disease, thyroid-stimulating hormone-secreting adenomas, resistant prolactinomas, and nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas causing mass effect, Medical and radiation therapy are reserved in cases in which surgery is not possible or does not provide a complete cure. In the last decades, tremendous innovations (i.e., targeted drugs and refined surgical tools and techniques) have expanded the treatment strategies for pituitary adenomas. We herein report the current indications for and depiction of the surgical techniques in pituitary surgery, review current medical treatments, and provide a glimpse of future possibilities.

AB In the study and practice of neurosurgery at the "Federico II" University of Naples, a central role has always been reserved for anatomy. Based on worldwide cooperation, the meaning of anatomical research has evolved from methodological investigation to an educational and communication tool. The contribution of our school to the anatomical data on the sellar region has been chronologically reviewed in the present report. The path that brought us to focus on the endoscopic endonasal anatomy has been presented, together with the evolution of anatomical investigation. The confidence achieved with decades of cadaveric laboratory studies has changed the profile of our anatomical investigations. The quantification and comparison became essential in these studies owing to their effect on surgical application and advanced imaging techniques entered the field of anatomical dissection. Anatomy at our school is an evolving science Our efforts in anatomical scientific publications and organization of participatory courses have made us a center of reference for endoscopic endonasal surgery and have allowed us to share our knowledge with other specialists in this field.

DT Article

   Posterior communicating artery aneurysms; Transsylvian approach
ID FENESTRATED CLIPS; COMPLEX
AB BACKGROUND: The anterior temporal approach (ATA) has been reported as suitable for surgical clipping of posteriorly projecting internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysms. As the ICA follows a variable course, tortuosity of the ICA may affect visualization of the aneurysm. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of the intracranial course of the ICA and aneurysm projection on surgical approach.
   METHODS: Consecutive patients with posterior communicating artery aneurysms treated with clipping at our hospital between May 2015 and April 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. When the transsylvian approach (TSA) could not achieve adequate exposure of the aneurysm, the ATA was subsequently performed. Distance between the ICA and the anterior and posterior clinoid line, angle between the midline and the C1 segment of the ICA, and aneurysm projection were compared between ATA and TSA groups.
   RESULTS: Of 52 patients (40 ruptured, 12 unruptured), 12 were in the ATA group, and 40 were in the TSA group. Mean ICAeanterior and posterior clinoid distance was significantly shorter in the ATA group than in the TSA group (P = 0.002), and mean midline-C1 angle was significantly larger in the ATA group than in the TSA group (P < 0.0001). The ATA group was associated with a greater frequency of posteriorly projecting aneurysms (12 of 12; 100%) than the TSA group (9 of 40; 22.5%) (P < 0.00001).
   CONCLUSIONS: A low-lying, laterally projecting intracranial ICA and posteriorly projecting aneurysm are predictors of the necessity for the ATA in the surgical clipping of posterior communicating artery aneurysms.

AB OBJECTIVE: The optimal surgical strategy for management of adult patients with craniopharyngioma remains controversial. To analyze the functional outcomes of adult patients with gross total resection (GTR) and subtotal resection (STR) of craniopharyngioma.
   METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, and Cochrane databases were searched from inception to July 19, 2018, for articles comparing postoperative endocrine function, vision, complications, and recurrence rates for adult patients with GTR and STR of craniopharyngioma. The articles were analyzed by meta-analysis of proportions using a random-effects model to calculate summary odds ratios (ORs).
   RESULTS: The initial search resulted in 2468 studies and 540 studies selected for full text review. Seventeen studies were included in the final analyses with 748 patients in the GTR cohort and 559 patients in the STR cohort. GTR resulted in a significantly lower likelihood of recurrence when compared with STR (OR, 0.106; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.067-0.168; P < 0.001), hut a significantly greater likelihood of panhypopituitarism (OR, 2.063; 95% CI, 1.058-4.024; P = 0.034) and permanent diabetes insipidus (OR, 2.776; 95% CI, 1.321-5.832; P = 0.007). There was no significant difference between the groups for postoperative worsened vision (P = 0.868), improved vision (P = 0.876), pathologic weight gain (P = 0.724), cerebrospinal fluid leak (P = 0.788), complications (P = 0.656), or death (P = 0.261).
   CONCLUSIONS: This is the first systematic review of functional outcomes of adult patients with craniopharyngioma. GTR results in decreased likelihood of recurrence, but increased likelihood of postoperative panhypopituitarsm and permanent diabetes insipidus. Surgeons should be aware of these associations when determining the optimal operative strategy for adult patients with craniopharyngioma.

AB BACKGROUND: Verapamil a calcinarn channel blacker, has shown promising results on cerebral vasospasm. However, it has not yet been accepted for treatment or prevention purposes because of the associated side effects, Although the effective results of nimodipine and nicardipine's intrathecal administration are well known, intrathecal verapamil has not been considered earlier. We used an experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage induced vasospasm model for the evaluation of vasodilator and neuroprotective effects of intrathecal verapamil,
   METHODS: A total of 24 Sprague-Davvley rats were randomly divided into the following 3 groups: group 1 (sham), group 2 (subarachnoid hemorrhage), and group 3 {verapamil). A double hemorrhage method was used. Group 2 did not receive any treatment. Verapamil (Eporon, Hem Ilac, Turkey) at a dose of 1000 mu g/kg was given intrathecally to group 3 rats. The animals were euthanized on day 7 of the procedure. Arterial wall thickness and lumen diameter in the basilar arterial cross-sectional areas, endothelin-1 serum level, oxidative stress index, and apoptosis were measured in all groups.
   RESULTS: In the verapamil group, wall thickness, endothelin-1 level, oxidative stress index, and apoptosis were found to be significantly lower than the subarachnoid hemorrhage group, but the lumen diameter was found to be greater, Intrathecal verapamil was found to decrease vasospasm parameters and apoptosis and increase the antioxidant and antiapoptotic pathways.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that intrathecal verapamil can prevent vasospasnt oxidative stress, and apoptosis after experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage.

SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Anterior inferior cerebellar artery; Facial and auditory nerve complex;
   Hemifacial spasm; Microvascular decompression
AB BACKGROUND: Decompression of the culprit artery causing hemifacial spasm (HFS), which passes between the facial nerve (cranial nerve [CN] VII) and the auditory nerve (CN VIII), can he difficult, especially if the artery compresses CN VII right after passing between the 2 nerves. Perforators or small arteries branching from near the compression site to adjacent structures can hinder the decompression process because such vessels can anchor the passing condition. The effect of such perforators or small arteries on the decompression process in such cases was investigated.
   METHODS: The culprit artery passed between any part of CN VII and VIII in 59 of 396 consecutive patients with HFS who underwent microvascular decompression. The culprit artery compressed CN VII right after passing between the 2 nerves in 22 of the 59 cases. Direction of the perforators or small arteries from near the compression site and direction of decompression of the culprit artery were analyzed in these 22 cases.
   RESULTS: Perforators or small arteries were observed in 20 cases, predominantly in the medial direction. The culprit artery was mobilized toward the petrous bone direction in most cases. No clear relationship was found between the 2 factors.
   CONCLUSIONS: Variation of curvature or tortuosity of the culprit artery and length of perforators or small branches may also have affected the decompression process and the directions. Adequate dissection near the compression site to obtain maximum mobilization of the culprit artery is necessary to achieve successful decompression in such cases.

AB OBJECTIVE: Endovascular treatment for unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs) has been regarded as second to none management nowadays as the result of its proven efficacy and need for less-invasive treatment. Most researchers have focused on the anatomical outcome after endovascular treatment, so in this study we estimated the real incidence of untoward effect and degree of patients' satisfaction based on s survey.
   METHODS: This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board, and 112 patients treated for saccular UIAs were evaluated among a total of 135 patients. After informed consentwas obtained, these patientswere sent a questionnaire regarding treatment effectiveness, complications, and patient satisfaction. These data were collected and compared with angiographic and clinical outcome.
   RESULTS: The response rate was 87.5% (98/112). Intracranial complications occurred in 10 aneurysms (10.2%): 7 ischemic and 3 hemorrhagic strokes. Other complications occurred in 30 patients (30.6%): 17 alopecia, 15 bleeding tendency, and 3 puncture-site complications. Overall, 89 (90.8%) patients reported being satisfied with their treatment. Patient satisfaction was closely correlated with clinically successful outcome of treatment.
   CONCLUSIONS: Ninety percent of patients were satisfied with the results after endovascular treatment of UIAs. Endovascular coil embolization was effective and safe procedure, with high clinical success rate and degree of satisfaction.

AB BACKGROUND: Flow diversion is increasingly used for off-label treatments of distal circulation aneurysms. Reports of use in sub-2.0-mm vessels are scant.
   METHODS: A prospectively collected, institutional review board-approved cerebral aneurysm database was reviewed to identify patients who underwent flow diversion with a 2.5-mm diameter Pipeline embolization device.
   RESULTS: Sixty-seven aneurysms were treated in 67 procedures (66 [99%] successful, 64 [96%] single device, 2 [3%] with 2 devices) in 57 patients. Average age was 56 years and 60% were female. Aneurysm location was 51 (76%) anterior cerebral artery, 14 (21%) middle cerebral artery, and 2 (3%) posterior cerebral artery. Aneurysm size was 4.1 +/- 3.0 mm (1-20 mm). Safety outcomes included 3 major strokes (4.5%) resulting in permanent neurologic deficit (modified Rankin Scale score 6,4,4), including 1 mortality (1.5%). Acute stent thrombosis was observed intraprocedurally or within 24 hours of each stroke. There were 2 small-volume (< 10 cm(3), 40 cm(3)) dependent intracerebral hemorrhage (3.0%) that resolved without permanent neurologic deficit. For effectiveness, 71% of patients underwent follow-up angiography. Complete occlusion was achieved by 88% at 6 months, 86% at 12 months, and 89% at last follow-up. A slight vessel diameter reduction was apparent on average 6.9 months after the procedure, which was statistically significant at the proximal (P = 0.001) but not distal (P = 0.317) device end. Preoperative average parent vessel diameter was 1.9 mm proximally (range, 1.1-2.6 mm) and 1.7 mm distally (range, 1.0-2.3 mm) of the Pipeline embolization device. Follow-up average vessel diameter was 1.7 mm proximally (range, 0.7-2.4 mm) and 1.6 mm distally (range, 0.6-2.1 mm). Flow delay associated with vessel diameter reduction occurred once. There were no cases of asymptomatic vessel occlusion.
   CONCLUSIONS: Flow diversion can be safe and effective for aneurysms originating from vessels 2.0 mm in diameter. Heightened vigilance for the prevention and management of acute stent and vessel thrombosis is warranted in these cases.

AB BACKGROUND: In the past decade, smartphone applications (Apps) have experienced remarkable development across all fields of medicine, including neurosurgery . However, owing to a lack of regulatory oversight and peer review, a clear need exists for a comprehensive review and audit of the existing available Apps. In the present study, we systematically reviewed the existing mobile Apps in neurosurgery, evaluated their clinical use by neurosurgery residents in Canada, and performed a quality audit of the most popular Apps.
   METHODS: Indexed Apps were identified from either the Google Play Store or the iOS App Store using a comprehensive list of keywords related to neurosurgery. A subsequent cross-sectional survey of 76 Canadian neurosurgery residents was conducted, including a section on smartphone App use. We next evaluated the most popular Apps among the residents using the Healthcare Smartphone App Evaluation Tool and performed a quality audit of their content using established medical references.
   RESULTS: The survey identified 118 mobile Apps related to neurosurgery. The 3 most used Apps used by the current cohort of Canadian neurosurgery residents were Neurosurgery Survival Guide, Neuromind, and the Journal of Neurosurgery App. Each of these 3 Apps received an excellent score on the Healthcare Smartphone App Evaluation Tool. A quality audit of 30 pages of the Neurosurgery Survival Guide and 40 clinical scores of the Neuromind App, performed by 10 neurosurgery residents, failed to reveal inaccurate or false statements.
   CONCLUSION: The present study has highlighted the current landscape of neurosurgery mobile Apps and their use among neurosurgery residents.

AB BACKGROUND: Herpes simplex virus (HSV) reactivation after surgery for trigeminal neuralgia has long been recognized. Only a few studies to date have focused on this complication, and its actual incidence remains unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of postoperative herpes labialis (HL) in a cohort of patients treated with either percutaneous balloon compression or microvascular decompression to identify potentially significant differences between different treatments.
   METHODS: A total of 92 patients who were operated on for TN with microvascular decompression (group A) or percutaneous balloon compression (group B) in the period 2010-2017 were retrospectively evaluated. The 2 subgroups of patients were compared according to history of previous HL and incidence of postoperative HL.
   RESULTS: The final cohort comprised 56 male and 36 female patients. Average age was 58.50 years; 30 male patients belonged to group A and 26 male patients belonged to group B. Lifetime incidence of episodes of HL before surgery in 18/58 patients in group A (31.0%) and 12/34 patients in group B (35.3%), with no statistically significant difference among subgroups. Postoperatively, 1/56 patients in group A (1.7%) experienced HL compared 5/34 patients in group B (14.7%), with a strongly statistically significant difference between the 2 subgroups.
   CONCLUSIONS: In our clinical experience, herpes simplex virus reactivation after surgery for trigeminal neuralgia is not so rare and is still not completely understood. Postoperative herpes simplex virus reactivation could be due to a direct mechanical injury on gasserian ganglion neurons, which is more common after percutaneous balloon compression.

DE 3-Dimensional; Endoscopy; Skull base
ID PITUITARY SURGERY; TRANSITION
AB BACKGROUND: Three-dimensional (3D) endoscopy is emerging tool in ear-nose-throat (ENT) and skull base surgery with the benefit of providing real-time depth perception. Several investigators have reported that the field of view (FOV) is reduced in 3D endoscopes compared with regular 2-dimensional (2D) endoscopes. Thus, we objectively compared the FOV of 2D and 3D endoscopes.
   METHODS: Using a standard 2D and 2 different 3D ENT endoscopes, images were captured of 1-mm graph paper from a set distance of 6 cm. The FOV was calculated from these images and compared among the endoscopes.
   RESULTS: The VisionSense 3D endoscope had a slightly ...duller FOV (9.1 cm vs. 10.1 cm; - 9.9%), and the Karl Storz 3D endoscope showed a slightly larger FOV (10.4 cm vs. 10.1 cm; +3.0%). However, the results were complicated by the different-shaped images produced by the 3D endoscopes.
   CONCLUSION: The differences in the FOV between the 2D and 3D endoscopes used in ENT surgery were not clinically significant. Thus, the FOV should not be considered a limitation of 3D technology.

TI Skull Base Dural Repair Using Autologous Fat as a Dural Substitute: An
   Efficient Technique
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Autologous fat graft; Dural repair; Dural substitute; Skull base surgery
AB BACKGROUND: Dural repair during skull base approaches remains challenging, especially in the presence of significant defects. The autologous fat has become an alternative to various substitute materials being used previously. We report here our experience and technique for the repair of notable skull base dural defects using autologous fat as a dural substitute.
   METHODS: Over a period of 5 years, 71 consecutive patients operated on for skull base pathologies with an important intraoperative dural defect repaired using autologous fat tissue as replacement material were reviewed. The graft, withdrawn from the abdomen or thigh, was flattened and applied to the defect. The clinical findings and outcomes were assessed.
   RESULTS: Main pathologies included schwannomas (45%) and meningiomas (35.21%), with no side predilection. Surgical approaches such as transcondylar fossa, suboccipital, and frontotemporal approaches were used. Dural defects were mainly located in the posterior (73.2%) and middle cranial fossae (25.4%). No harvesting site-related complication occurred. In 7 cases, transitory subcutaneous fluid collection spontaneously resorbing after 8 days to 2 months was observed. No external cerebrospinal fluid leakage, infection, or other complication was noted during the following period.
   CONCLUSIONS: Dural repair can be effectively and durably achieved using autologous fat graft as a dural substitute during skull base approaches, even in cases of extended defects. The observed characteristics of the fat graft along with the achieved outcome make it an ideal dural substitute.

AB BACKGROUND: Cerebral vasospasm remains a serious problem affecting morbidity and mortality in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) during neurosurgery. We aimed to demonstrate the role of the transient receptor potential channel and other channels for Ca2+ in the etiology of cerebral vasospasm using 2-aminoethyl diphenylborinate (2-APB) and the effective dose range of an unstudied pharmacological agent, which can limit vasospasm.
   METHODS: We performed an experimental study using 32 Sprague-Dawley rats divided into 4 groups: sham group (n = 8), SAH group (n = 8), 2-APB group (SAH rats intraperitoneally administered with 0.5 mg/kg 2-APB; n = 8), and 2-APB-2 group (SAH rats intraperitoneally administered with 2 mg/kg 2-APB; n = 8). The rats were sacrificed after 24 hours, and superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, malondialdehyde, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interleukin-1 beta in the brain tissue and serum were measured. The histopathological investigation of brain tissue included measurement of the luminal diameter and wall thickness of the basilar artery (BA), and apoptotic cells in the hippocampus were counted after caspase staining.
   RESULTS: Autologous arterial blood injection into the cisterna magna caused vasospasm in rats. 2-APB treatment increased the BA wall thickness and reduced the BA lumen diameter, inducing significant vascular changes. 2-APB also alleviated cell apoptosis at 24 hours after SAH.
   CONCLUSION: In experimental SAH in rats, 2-APB treatment increased the BA wall thickness and reduced the BA lumen diameter, inducing significant vascular changes. 2-APB also alleviated cell apoptosis at 24 hours after SAH.

AB OBJECTIVE: Spinal dural arteriovenous fistulas (SDAVFs) are rare vascular spinal malformations. According to the reported data, surgery seems to result in better occlusion rates than endovascular treatment. However, the post-treatment evolution of neurological symptoms stratified by the treatment remains unknown. The main objective of the present study was to compare the clinical outcomes for patients according to the treatment method.
   METHODS: The data from 63 patients with SDAVFs from 2000 to 2017 at 4 academic neurosurgical departments were retrospectively analyzed. Preoperative and postoperative examination neurological status was assessed using the Aminoff-Logue scale (ALS), which evaluates gait and micturition disturbances. Initial occlusion, late recurrence, and complications of the 2 techniques were also reviewed.
   RESULTS: Patients who had undergone surgery and embolization improved clinically on the ALS (P = 0.0009), and no significant differences were found between the 2 techniques. Subgroup analysis using the ALS showed that patients who had undergone surgery and embolization without late recurrence improved (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.0334, respectively) and that patients who had undergone surgery or embolization with late recurrence did not improve. The initial occlusion rate was in favor of surgery, with 91.3% versus 70% for endovascular treatment (P = 0.050). The late recurrence rate was higher for embolization (21.4% vs. 9.1% for surgery; P = 0.28).
   CONCLUSIONS: Surgery can be proposed as first-line treatment of SDAVFs after multidisciplinary discussion between neurosurgeons and neuroradiologists. The development of late recurrence negatively affects the neurological outcome of patients.

AB OBJECTIVE: Neurogenic drop foot is a common result of acquired damage of the central nervous system and can cause severe restriction of mobility. ActiGait, an implantable functional electrical stimulation device, restores ankle dorsiflexion by active peroneal nerve stimulation. The aim of our study was to evaluate its effect on foot contact pattern during normal walk.
   METHODS: Eight patients with drop foot who used ActiGait in everyday life performed a 20-meter comfortable walk test. Gait parameters were evaluated with an insole system (Medilogic). Percentage of biped stance in a double-step, effective foot length, width of gait, and overall plantar load were measured in comparison with and without activated drop foot stimulation.
   RESULTS: Effective foot length increased in all patients on average from 46.0% to 60.2% (P = 0.038). However, percentage of biped stance in a double-step showed no significant difference (31.2% vs. 27.8% on average, P = 0.063), nor did width of gait (2.6% vs. 2.4% on average, P = 0.73) and overall plantar load (3.51 N/cm(2)vs. 3.39 N/cm(2), P = 0.25).
   CONCLUSION: The ActiGait implantable drop foot stimulator significantly improves effective foot length during normal walk of patients with neurogenic drop foot. Further investigation is needed to confirm whether ActiGait has no effect on the other parameters or whether it facilitates permanent gait adaptations that persist without the activated device.

AB BACKGROUND: The LACE+ index (Length of stay, Acuity of admission, Charlson Comorbidity Index score, and Emergency department [ED] visits in the past 6 months) is a tool used to predict 30-day readmissions. We sought to examine this predictive tool in patients undergoing brain tumor surgery.
   METHODS: Admissions and readmissions for patients undergoing craniotomy for supratentorial neoplasm at a single multihospital academic medical center were analyzed. All brain tumor cases for which the patient was alive at 30 days after surgery were included (n = 352). Simple logistic regression analyses were used to assess the ability of the LACE+ index and subsequent single variables to accurately predict the outcome measures of 30-day readmission, reoperation, and ED visit. Analysis of the model's or variable's discrimination was determined by the receiver operating characteristic curve as represented by the C-statistic.
   RESULTS: The sample included admissions for craniotomy for supratentorial neoplasm (n = 352). Assessment of the LACE+ index demonstrates a 1.02x increased odds of 30-day readmission for every 1-unit increase in LACE+ score (P = 0.031, CI = 1.00-1.03). Despite this, analysis of the receiver operating characteristic curve indicates that LACE+ index has poor specificity in predicting 30-day readmission (C-statistic = 0.58). A 1-unit increase in LACE+ score also predicts a 0.98x reduction in odds of home discharge (P < 0.001, CI = 0.97-0.99, C-statistic = 0.70). But LAC+ index does not predict 30-day reoperation (P = 0.945) or 30-day ED visits (P = 0.218).
   CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study demonstrate that the LACE+ index is not yet suitable as a prediction model for 30-day readmission in a brain tumor population.

AB BACKGROUND: Resection and remission rates are low in pituitary adenomas that invade the cavernous sinus (CS) because of the complexity of the region. In this study, the authors describe the invasion patterns and surgical approaches for these corridors.
   METHODS: Endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery was performed in 1849 patients between August 1997 and 2017; 381 of these patients were included in the study because of the presence of CS invasion. CS invasion pathways and CS compartments were defined, and these patients were divided into 3 groups according to their invasion corridors. The cases were also categorized according to the Knosp classification.
   RESULTS: A total of 381 patients were included, 199 of whom were men. The mean follow-up duration was 34 months. In preoperative magnetic resonance imaging measurements, 2 of 381 patients had microadenoma, 350 of 381 had macroadenoma, and 29 of 381 had giant adenoma. When the early postoperative magnetic resonance images were compared with the preoperative images, 91 of 381 (23.9%) patients had subtotal tumor resection, 83 of 381 (21.8%) had near-total tumor resection, and 207 of 381 (54.3%) had gross total tumor resection. Considering the invasion classification with endoscopic confirmation, there were 168 of 381 (44.1%) cases of isolated medial corridor involvement, 74 of 381 (19.4%) cases of isolated lateral corridor involvement, and 139 of 381 (36.5%) cases of total involvement cases.
   CONCLUSIONS: Medial wall defect has no importance in the invasion. Similarly, seeing the existence of pitholes is not an invasion criterion. Pituitary adenomas invade 4 compartments: the superior, anteroinferior, posterior, and lateral compartments of the CS via 2 corridors. Increased experience, novel approaches, and endoscopic developments have contributed immensely to this field.

AB OBJECTIVE: We investigated the use of high-flow superficial temporal artery trunk-to-radial artery-to-middle cerebral artery (STAt-RA-MCA) bypass to prevent ischemic stroke in patients with symptomatic internal carotid artery occlusion (SICAO).
   METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the data from patients with SICAO who had undergone high-flow STAt-RA-MCA bypass in our center from October 2014 to November 2017. The incidence of ischemic stroke, changes in cerebral blood flow, characteristics of perioperative complications, and related factors determining the blood flow rate in the graft were analyzed.
   RESULTS: From October 2014 to November 2017, we treated 21 patients with SICAO using high-flow STAt-RA-MCA bypass. A total of 42 ischemic stroke events had been reported within 6 months before surgery. The ipsilateral/ contralateral mean transit time (I/C MTT) ratio before surgery was 1.24 +/- 0.10 (range, 1.14-1.51). During a median follow-up period of 692 days (range, 212-1114), 3 transient ischemic attacks occurred in 3 patients; 18 patients (85.7%) did not experience recurrent stroke. The patency rate of the bypass graft was 95.2% (20 of 21). The I/C MTT ratio was 1.06 +/- 0.11 on postoperative day 1 in all patients and was significantly different from the preoperative I/C MTT ratio P < 0.001). The surgical complication rate was 9.5% (2 of 21), and no reoperation was required.
   CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that high-flow STAt-RA-MCA bypass can effectively reduce the risk of stroke in patients with SICAO. Moreover, the surgical procedure is a highly safe procedure. Further randomized controlled studies are required to draw more precise conclusions.

AB BACKGROUND: Intracranial pseudoaneurysms (PSAs) are associated with high rupture and mortality rates and have traditionally been treated by parent vessel sacrifice. There has been recent interest in using flow-diverting devices for treatment of these complex lesions while preserving flow through the parent artery. The objective of this study is to examine the safety and efficacy of these devices in the treatment of intracranial PSA.
   METHODS: We performed a multi-institutional retrospective study of intracranial PSAs treated with the Pipeline Embolization Device (PED) between 2014 and 2017 at 7 institutions. Complications and clinical and radiographic outcomes were reviewed.
   RESULTS: A total of 19 patients underwent PED placement for intracranial PSA. Iatrogenic injury and trauma comprised most etiologies in our series. The mean pseudoaneurysm diameter was 8.8 mm, and 18 of 19 PSAs (95%) involved the internal carotid artery (ICA). Multiple PEDs were deployed in a telescoping fashion in 7 patients (37%). Of the 18 patients with follow up imaging, 14 (78%) achieved complete pseudoaneurysm obliteration and 2 achieved near-complete obliteration (11%). Two patients (11%) were found to have significant pseudoaneurysm progression on short-term follow-up and required ICA sacrifice. No patients experienced new neurologic deficits or deterioration secondary to PED placement. No patients experienced bleeding or rebleeding from PSA.
   CONCLUSIONS: In well-selected patients, the use of flow-diverting stents may be a feasible alternative to parent vessel sacrifice. Given the high morbidity and mortality associated with PSA, we recommend short-and long-term radiographic follow-up for patients treated with flow-diverting stents.

   MENINGIOMAS; EXPERIENCE; LIGATION; BRAIN
AB BACKGROUND: The unilateral interhemispheric approach for distal anterior cerebral artery aneurysms presents several risks, such as postoperative venous infarction due to occasional sacrifice of parasagittal bridging vein and postoperative frontal lobe damage due to retraction force. To overcome these risks, we used a bifrontal craniotomy with straight dural incision and cutting of the superior sagittal sinus.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 61 patients (42 unruptured and 19 ruptured A2 and A3 aneurysms) who under aneurysm clipping through bifrontal interhemispheric approach between March 2007 and December 2017. There were 35 A2 aneurysms and 27 A3 aneurysms, and mean size of aneurysms was 5.45 mm. The modified bifrontal interhemispheric approach involved 3 steps: bifrontal craniotomy of centrobasal portion of the frontal bone, ligation and division of anterior one third of the superior sagittal sinus, and approaching the aneurysm via the interhemispheric space. All patients underwent computed tomography on postoperative days 3 and 7 for evaluation of brain retraction damage or venous infarction.
   RESULTS: Among patients with ruptured aneurysms, 79% had a favorable outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale score 4 or 5) 6 months after primary subarachnoid hemorrhage; all patients with unruptured aneurysms had favorable outcomes. Surgical outcome was strongly related to preoperative neurologic Hunt and Hess grade. Three patients had poor outcomes due to poor Hunt and Hess grade on admission (grade 3 in 2 patients, grade 4 in 1 patient). Follow-up CT showed that venous infarction did not occur in any of the patients.
   CONCLUSIONS: Modified bifrontal interhemispheric approach may be a safe and effective method for treating A2 and A3 aneurysms with relatively good clinical outcome and no surgery-related complications.

AB OBJECTIVE: To analyze the correlation between C2 incidence (C2I) and cervical and thoracolumbar sagittal parameters and determine the effectiveness of C2I for evaluating global spinopelvic sagittal alignment.
   METHODS: Whole spine standing lateral radiographs of 226 patients (mean age, 47.8 +/- 11.3 years; 63% women) were analyzed. Spinopelvic parameters and incidence angles of inflection point were evaluated. The correlation between each parameter was analyzed using Pearson correlation coefficient and linear regression. Using C2I quartiles, 3 groups were compared to distinguish different alignment patterns by analysis of variance.
   RESULTS: C2I correlated significantly with C0-2 lordosis (CO2L), C2-7 lordosis (C27L), C0-7 lordosis , C2 slope (C2S), T1 slope-C27L C2-7 sagittal vertical axis, and chin brow vertical angle (CBVA) in cervical parameters (r = - 0.378, r = 0.533, r = 0.251, r = 0.688, r = 0.681, r = 0.278, and r = 0.351, respectively; P < 0.01) and with T1 incidence (T1I), pelvic incidence-lumbar lordosis mismatch, L1 incidence (L1I), pelvic tilt (PT), and pelvic incidence (PI) (r = 0.480, r = 0.516, r = 0.518, r = 0.635, and r = 0.392, respectively; P < 0.01) in thoracolumbar alignment parameters. C2I was estimated by the 2 following equations: C2I = 1.00C2S + 1.0PT and C2I = 0.98PI - 0.99LL + 0.98 thoracic kyphosis - 1.0C271 (R-2 = 0.97, P < 0.001, respectively), with an excellent coefficient of determination. PI, PT, L1I, T1I, and C2S were increased significantly between groups using C2I quartiles. In the high C2I group, C27L and C0-7 lordosis had less lordosis; however, C02L had more lordosis and C2-7 sagittal vertical axis and CBVA showed higher than low C2I group.
   CONCLUSIONS: C2I was significantly correlated with both cervical and thoracolumbar sagittal parameters, and different sagittal alignment patterns were presented regarding the amount of C2I. As the geometric summation from the pelvis to C2 vertebra, C2I would be a beneficial clue to connect correlation chains of spinal sagittal alignment.

AB OBJECTIVE: To compare circumferential minimally invasive (cMIS) versus open surgeries for mild-to-moderate adult spinal deformity (ASD) with regard to intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital lengths of stay (LOS).
   METHODS: A retrospective review of 2 multicenter ASD databases with 426 ASD (sagittal vertical axis <6 cm) surgery patients with 4 or more fusion levels and 2-year follow-up was conducted. ICU stay, LOS, and estimated blood loss (EBL) were compared between open and cMIS surgeries.
   RESULTS: Propensity matching resulted in 88 patients (44 cMIS, 44 open). cMIS were older (61 vs. 53 years, P = 0.005). Mean levels fused were 6.5 in cMIS and 7.1 in open (P = 0.368). Preoperative lordosis was higher in open than in cMIS (42.7 degrees vs. 40.9 degrees, P = 0.016), and preoperative visual analog score back pain was greater in open than in cMIS (7 vs. 6.2, P = 0.033). Preoperative and postoperative spinopelvic parameters and coronal Cobb angles were not different. EBL was 534 cc in cMIS and 1211 cc in open (P < 0.001). Transfusions were less in cMIS (27.3% vs. 70.5%, P < 0.001). ICU stay was 0.6 days for cMIS and days for open (P = 0.009). Hospital LOS was 7.9 days for cMIS versus 9.6 for open (P = 0.804).
   CONCLUSIONS: For patients with mild-to-moderate ASD, cMIS surgery had a significantly lower EBL and shorter ICU stay. Major and minor complication rates were lower in cMIS patients than open patients. Overall LOS was shorter in cMIS patients, but did not reach statistical significance.

AB OBJECTIVE: Imaging to visualize nerves around tumors preoperatively could help the surgeon to plan the surgery and excise the tumor with preservation or improvement in patients' quality of life. In the present prospective study, we attempted to correlate the preoperative cranial nerves (i.e., trigeminal, abducens, facial, and vestibulocochlear diffusion tensor tractography and anatomic magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] findings) with intraoperative findings during cerebellopontine angle (CPA) tumor surgery.
   METHODS: The 40 enrolled patients had CPA tumors (31 vestibular schwannomas, 5 epidermoid tumors, 2 meningiomas, 2 trigeminal schwannomas). All the patients were undergoing microsurgery for the first time. They underwent preoperative MRI for anatomic and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data. The imaging series were postprocessed, and 3-dimensional images were obtained. The location of the involved nerves around the tumors was recorded during surgery by the senior surgeon, who was kept unaware of the results of the fiber tracking, and a correlation was performed.
   RESULTS: We evaluated the correlation between the DTI and intraoperative findings for the nerve location in relation to the tumor in the CPA. The correlation between the DTI and intraoperative findings for the facial, trigeminal, and vestibulocochlear nerves was 85% (34 of 40), 85% (34 of 40), and 75% (12 of 16), respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: The modified technical parameters proposed could lead to better preservation of cranial nerve function, especially for patients with large tumors. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first systematic study of relevant cranial nerves in 40 patients with demonstration of the vestibulocochlear bundle by preoperative MRI in the most common CPA tumors using advanced MRI sequences such as diffusion tensor tractography and capturing the data in a multiplanar format.

AB BACKGROUND: Atlantoaxiai fusion often requires C2 nerve transection for complete C1 lateral mass exposure. Nerve transection is made ideally at the preganglionic segment proximal to the dorsal root ganglion to minimize the risk of postoperative dysesthesias. If the nerve is transected too proximally, cerebrospinal fluid leak may be encountered by violation of the dura and arachnoid where the sensory and motor nerve rootlets exit the subarachnoid space. In this study we aimed to quantify the length of the C2 nerve preganglionic segment using cadaveric specimens and develop a method for reliable intraoperative localization for sectioning during C1-2 arthrodesis.
   METHODS: Using microsurgical techniques, 16 C2 nerves from 8 frozen and injected cadaveric cervical spine specimens were dissected. Two key measurements were taken to establish a reliable method of preganglionic segment identification. The "sweet spot" for nerve transection was based on the approximate location of the midpoint of the preganglionic segment.
   RESULTS: The final determination of the ideal spot for C2 nerve transection using these calculations was 3 mm lateral to the medial border of the lateral mass.
   CONCLUSIONS: This anatomic study found remarkable consistency in the preganglionic segment length. The medial border of the lateral mass appeared to be a consistently reliable landmark for identification of the preganglionic segment of the C2 nerve root. By using relationships between known anatomic structures intraoperatively, safety of atlantoaxial fixation can be optimized to maximize complication avoidance and satisfactory patient outcomes.

ID CELL TRANSPLANTATION; STEM-CELLS; MICROTRANSPLANTATION; BRAIN
AB OBJECTIVE: This video article describes and illustrates the function and application of the intracerebral microinjection instrument (IMI). This newly developed technology allows delivery of therapeutic agents within the human brain in complex 3-dimensional arrays using a single pass or minimal overlying penetrations through brain tissue.
   METHODS: The IMI uses a delivery microcannula with a reduced diameter that minimizes local trauma and is capable of delivering precise volumes of therapeutic agents to discrete brain substructures. The IMI also permits simultaneous recording of neural activity during the delivery procedure, enabling extreme precision using electrophysiologic mapping. Surgical planning software designed specifically for the IMI enables strategic placement of multiple injections.
   RESULTS: This technology platform is presently being --A successfully to deliver therapeutic stem cells to restore function in stroke patients.
   CONCLUSIONS: Additional applications of the IMI include delivery of viral vectors for gene therapy, infusion of neurotrophic factors, targeted delivery of chemotherapeutic agents, and delivery of antiretroviral medications.

AB INTRODUCTION: Anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) aneurysms are rare, accounting for 0.2%-1.3% of all intracranial aneurysms. The standard treatment is often endovascular embolization or neck clipping; however, sacrifice of the parent vessel is sometimes necessary. Addition of revascularization procedures is a subject of controversy. The occipital artery (OA) has been used as a donor for bypass, but recently there has been a trend toward intracranial-intracranial approaches. The posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA)-AICA side-to-side bypass may serve as a safe alternative.
   OBJECTIVE: To characterize the PICA-AICA side-to-side bypass and the OA-AICA end-to-side bypass and review the literature relevant to AICA revascularization.
   METHODS: We performed a far-lateral approach on 12 cadaveric specimens and analyzed the regional anatomy. On this basis, we performed either an OA-AICA or a PICA-AICA bypass and took morphometric measurements relevant to the technique.
   RESULTS: PICA-AICA bypass was successful in 6/12 specimens. The length of the flocculopeduncular segment was 42.6 +/- 15.8 mm in the specimens in which the bypass was feasible and 26.2 +/- 7.2 mm in those in which the bypass was not feasible (P = 0.04). Mean distance between AICA and PICA was 5.3 +/- 4 mm in the specimens in which side-to-side bypass was feasible and 11.6 +/- 4.2 mm in the specimens in which it was not (P = 0.02). OA-AICA end-to-side bypass was feasible in all the specimens (75% in the flocculopeduncular segment; 25% in the cortical segment).
   CONCLUSIONS: This is the first cadaveric study analyzing the PICA-AICA side-to-side bypass for AICA revascularization. Our analyses provide evidence for the feasibility of this bypass and document the anatomic variations that may indicate its use.

AB BACKGROUND: Fait grafting has been described as an option to repair frontotemporal contour deformities (volumetric deficiency of bone and/or soft tissues) after neurosurgical/craniofacial surgical interventions. However, technical surgical descriptions have varied, with reports describing the bolus fat injection or the classical multi-layer injection, but with no detailed descriptions concerning how and where the fat should be grafted. The purpose of this study was to assess the frontotemporal symmetry outcomes after a single fat-grafting procedure for postoperative frontotemporal contour deformity reconstructions using the anatomical fat-grafting approach.
   METHODS: A prospective analysis was conducted of consecutive patients (n = 106) who underwent anatomical fat grafting (Coleman's structural fat grafting technique using anatomical facial subunit and fat compartment principles) to reconstruct frontotemporal contour deformities after neurosurgical/craniofacial surgical interventions. A subjective assessment by a panel of external surgical professionals and laypersons was obtained to grade the frontotemporal symmetry. Objective ultrasound symmetry assessment was blindly performed preoperatively and at 3 and 12-month follow-up.
   RESULTS: There were significant (all P < 0.05) post-operative subjective and objective frontotemporal symmetry enhancements (preoperative < postoperative) after anatomical fat grafting, with no differences (all P > 0.05) between the 3- and 12-month postoperative comparisons. Thirty-seven percent of patients required an additional fat grafting session for residual asymmetry after 12 months of follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients with frontotemporal contour deformities presented improved subjective and objective frontotemporal symmetry after an anatomical fat grafting session.

AB OBJECTIVE: Satellite sign (SS) and island sign (IS) are novel noncontrast computed tomography (CT) predictors of hematoma growth. The aim of this study was to compare diagnostic performance of IS and SS in predicting hematoma growth and functional outcome in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).
   METHODS: The study included patients with ICH who underwent baseline CT scan within 6 hours of symptom onset and follow-up CT scan within 36 hours after initial CT between July 2012 and April 2017. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of IS and SS in predicting hematoma growth and functional outcome were assessed. Accuracy of the 2 signs in predicting hematoma growth and functional outcome was analyzed using receiver operating characteristic analysis. Association between the presence of IS and SS and ICH growth was assessed using multivariate logistic regression.
   RESULTS: Of 307 patients with ICH, IS was observed in 46 patients (15.0%), and SS was observed in 151 patients (49.2%). Rates of hematoma growth were 40.4% in SS+ patients, 91.3% in IS+ patients, 18.4% in SS-IS- patients, 21.1% in SS+IS- patients, 100% in SS-IS+ patients, and 90.5% in SS+ IS+ patients. After adjusting for potential confounders, IS remained an independent predictor for hematoma growth and poor functional outcome. The area under the curve of IS was significantly larger than the area under the curve of SS in predicting hematoma growth (P = 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: IS seems to be an optimal shape irregularity imaging marker for predicting hematoma growth and functional outcome in patients with ICH.

AB BACKGROUND: The use of mechanical thrombectomy for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is rapidly increasing. However, there are limited data on the comparative effects of the various devices approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of AIS. We aimed to perform a network meta-analysis to assess the relative efficacy and safety of 4 thrombectomy devices.
   METHODS: We searched PubMed, the Cochrane Library Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Embase for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and parallel group observational studies that assessed thrombectomy devices in patients with AIS. Primary efficacy outcomes included functional independence (90-day modified Rankin Scale score) and recanalization rate (thrombolysis in cerebral infarction score). Safety outcomes included incidence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhages and 90-day mortality.
   RESULTS: Five RCTs and 5 observational studies, including 1659 participants, were included. According to GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations), most of the studies are of moderate quality of evidence. Compared with Penumbra, Solitaire and Trevo were associated with higher rates of functional independence (3.75 [1.44-7.66] and 4.68 [1.42-11.50], respectively). For revascularization, Solitaire and Trevo had higher rates of successful recanalization than Merci (2.99 [1.15-6.53] and 3.34 [1.20-8.01], respectively). In terms of safety outcomes (symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage and mortality), there was no significant difference between any comparators.
   CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that stent retriever devices were superior to nonestent retriever devices in functional outcomes and recanalization without significant increases in death or symptomatic hemorrhage. We found no evidence for a differential therapy effect by stent type. Further high-quality RCTs assessing efficacy difference between these 2 stent retrievers are justified.

AB BACKGROUND: Intracranial hemorrhage can be a devastating complication of endovascular thrombectomy (ET) after acute ischemic stroke increasing disability and mortality. Patients with low platelet count were excluded from major ET trials. This study explores the association between platelet count and intracranial hemorrhage after ET.
   METHODS: A retrospective review of patients undergoing ET for anterior circulation large vessel occlusions at a single comprehensive stroke center between January 2015 and February 2018 was performed. Demographic and clinical information including National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, intravenous tissue plasminogen activator administration, ASPECTS, platelet count, international normalized ratio, time from symptom onset to recanalization, and modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction score were analyzed. Radiological imaging and clinical course in the hospital was evaluated to identify parenchymal hemorrhage and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH). Univariable and multivariable analyses were conducted.
   RESULTS: A total of 555 patients underwent ET and 43% were male. The mean age and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score were 71 +/- 14 years and 17 +/- 6, respectively. Parenchymal hemorrhage-2 and sICH (European-Australian Cooperative Acute Stroke Study-III criteria) were noted in 9.7% and 5.8% patients, respectively. Rates of sICH in patients with platelet count <100,000 (n = 15), 100,000 to <150,000 (n = 59), and >= 150,000 (n = 481) were 6.7% (n = 1), 10.1% (n = 6), and 5.2% (n = 25), respectively (P = 0.25), and rates of modified Rankin Scale 0-2 at 90 days were 26.7%, 23.7%, and 36.4%, respectively (P = 0.12). Low ASPECTS was a significant predictor of sICH per European-Australian Cooperative Acute Stroke Study-III definition (P value = 0.046). Platelet count was not a predictor (P = 0.386) of sICH.
   CONCLUSIONS: Risk of sICH after ET is low and comparable in patients with low and normal platelet counts. Low platelets should not exclude patients from undergoing intra-arterial therapy.

AB OBJECTIVE: The far-lateral approach (FLA) remains a challenge for neurosurgeons due to the complex anatomy of this region, especially in patients with anatomical variations. There is therefore an urgent need for better quantitative knowledge of the microsurgical anatomy of the FLA.
   METHODS: The study was performed using the dried skulls and atlas vertebrae of 50 Chinese adults, in which significant clinical parameters were measured. We further used 12 cadaveric heads to simulate the FLA to explore the step-by-step anatomy entailed by this procedure, enabling us to obtain key images and related information.
   RESULTS: Limited to hypoglossal canal, the occipital condyle posterior was abraded by roughly 10 mm, which provided good exposure to the ventral front of the foramen magnum. When occipital artery exits the occipital groove, the mean diameter was 2.20 mm. The average occipital artery suboccipital segment length was 65.26 mm. The posterior spinal artery (PSA) and posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) generally originated from the fourth vertebral artery segment intradurally, and the mean distances from the PSA and PICA to the dural entry point of the vertebral artery were 2.62 mm and 8.71 mm, respectively. The incidence of PSA and PICA arising from the third vertebral artery segment was 16.67% and 4.17%, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: Understanding the important anatomic structures of the CVJ region and developing improved knowledge of the microsurgical anatomy of the FLA offer an opportunity to ensure safe exposure and treatment of lesions in the ventral and ventrolateral regions of the CVJ.

AB BACKGROUND: Intracerebral hemorrhage, seizures, neurologic deficits, and cognitive impairments due to brain AVM in childhood are incriminating for brain and executive function with sequelae for further social life. Long-term follow-up data on brain AVM in young patients are rare, making it difficult to compare and evaluate treatment risks and outcomes.
   METHODS: We studied young patients with brain AVM who were referred to our institution between 2005 and 2012 and for whom follow-up data were available. We stratified the patients into those with ruptured AVM (rAVM) and unruptured AVM (uAVM) and compared treated and nontreated patients. Differences in outcome and social participation were assessed.
   RESULTS: A total of 29 young patients with brain AVM, median age 16 years, were included in our study with complete follow-up data of over 5 years (mean, 6 years). In 18 (62.1%) patients rAVM and in 11 (37.9%) patients uAVM were found. Twenty (69%) patients received treatment (rAVM 70% vs. uAVM 30%). Among treatment methods, microsurgery was most frequently used (rAVM 33.3% vs. uAVM 36.4%). In rAVM, 16 of 18 (88.9%) patients returned to work or school, and in uAVM, 11 (100%) patients did so. Concerning cognitive problems, no statistically significant difference was found in the 2 groups comparing treated and nontreated patients (P> 0.05). A favorable outcome was achieved in 13 (72.2%) patients with rAVM and in 11 (100%) patients with uAVM.
   CONCLUSION: Favorable outcome was achieved in the majority of patients. The rate of neurologic improvement and participation in social life was very high in the 2 groups.

AB OBJECTIVE: In the past decade, prevalence of obesity in the United States have been soaring at a disparaging rate. Previous spine studies have associated obesity with inferior surgical outcomes, increased complication and 30-day readmission rates, and worsening patient-reported outcomes. However, there is a paucity of data identifying whether the impact of obesity is sustained in patients undergoing complex deformity correction involving 7 levels or greater. The aim of this study was to determine whether obesity impacts surgical outcomes, patient-reported pain scores, and 30-day readmission rates after complex spinal fusions >= 7 levels.
   METHODS: The medical records of 112 adult patients (>= 18 years old) with spine deformity undergoing elective, primary complex spinal fusion (>= 7 levels) for deformity correction at a major academic institution from 2010 to 2015 were reviewed. Preoperative body mass index greater than or equal to 30 kg/m(2) was classified as obese. Patient demographics, comorbidities, and intraoperative and postoperative complication rates were collected for each patient. Inpatient patient-reported pain scores and ambulatory status also were collected. The primary outcomes of this study were surgical outcomes, patient-reported pain scores, and 30-day readmission rates.
   RESULTS: Of the 112 patients, 33 (29.5%) were obese (obese: n = 33 vs. non-obese: n [79). Patient demographics and comorbidities were similar between both cohorts, including age, sex, diabetes, hypertension, and home narcotic use. The median number of fusion levels operated, length of surgery, estimated blood loss, transfusion, and complication rates were similar between both cohorts. Moreover, the postoperative complication profiles between the cohorts also were similar, with a comparable length of hospital stay (obese: 6.5 +/- 4.6 days vs. non-obese: 7.0 +/- 3.9 days, P = 0.5833) and 30-day readmission rates (obese: 12.1% vs. non-obese: 13.9%, P = 0.7984). Baseline (P = 0.6826), first (P = 0.9691), and last (P = 0.9583) postoperative patient-reported pain scores were similar between cohorts. Analogously, ambulatory status was similar between the cohorts, including days from operating room to ambulation (P = 0.3471) and number of steps on first (P = 0.9173) and last (P = 0.1634) ambulatory day before discharge.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that obesity does not significantly affect surgical outcomes, patient-reported pain scores, and 30-day readmission rates after complex spinal surgery requiring >= 7 levels of fusion. Further studies are necessary to corroborate our findings.

AB OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the tumor control and cranial nerve (CN) outcomes after adjuvant stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for petroclival, cavernous sinus, and cerebellopontine angle meningiomas.
   METHODS: From our prospectively maintained database of 2022 patients with meningioma who had undergone Leksell SRS during a 30-year interval, we found 43 patients with petroclival, 94 with cavernous sinus, and 13 patients with cerebellopontine angle meningiomas who had undergone adjuvant SRS after surgical resection of the meningioma. The patients included in the present report had had >= 1 CN deficit at the initial presentation and a minimum follow-up period of 12 months. The median age at SRS was 54 years (range, 22-81). SRS was performed for residual tumor in 104 patients (69%) and recurrent tumor in 46 patients (31%). The median tumor volume treated with SRS was 8.1 cm(3) (range, 0.3-42), and the median margin dose was 13 Gy (range, 10-20).
   RESULTS: Tumor control was achieved in 135 patients (90%) at a median follow-up point of 75 months. The progression-free survival rate after SRS was 99.5% at 1 year, 98% at 3 years, 95% at 5 years, and 90% at 10 years. Overall, 29 of the 150 patients (19%) reported improvement in CN function. Deterioration in CN function after SRS developed in 15 patients (10%). The rate of deterioration was 3.5% at 1 year, 5.5% at 3 years, and 7% at 5 years.
   CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant SRS provides effective tumor control and a low rate of new or worsening CN deficits.

AB OBJECTIVE: To study the prevalence of OTX1 and OTX2 gene expression in 60 medulloblastoma specimen samples and to establish correlations between gene expression and clinical and histopathological aspects.
   METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 60 patients with a diagnosis of medulloblastoma at the Clinicas Hospital of the School of Medicine, University of Sao Paulo, and the Cancer Hospital of Barretos. We created a database of the 60 patients containing information on the gene expression of OTX1 and OTX2 (obtained using realtime polymerase chain reaction) and clinical and epidemiological data. Statistical tests were performed to verify potential correlations of clinicopathological data and follow-up aspects with gene expression.
   RESULTS: The OTX1 gene was expressed in 52% of the study population. Expression varied with age (higher in adults), location (predominantly by hemisphere), and histological type (desmoplastic). The OTX2 gene was expressed in 62% of the study population. Expression varied with age (higher in younger age groups), location (predominantly vermis), and histological type (classic and anaplastic). A statistical correlation between OTX2 gene expression and the development of leptomeningeal metastases was observed.
   CONCLUSIONS: The relative expression of OTX1 and OTX2 was dependent on patient age, tumor location, and histological variant. In addition, OTX2 expression might be a predictive factor for leptomeningeal metastases of medulloblastoma. The OTX pathway should be consider as an important venue for medulloblastomas development.

AB BACKGROUND: The techniques for atlantoaxial arthrodesis have been modified over the years, and placing C1 lateral mass screws is a modern approach. C2 neuropathy is a complication of concern; however, sacrifice of the C2 nerve is an accepted and often favored adjunct. The impact of the technique for cutting the C2 nerve is not adequately addressed in the literature. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcomes from a series of roots sacrificed during C1-2 fusion with attention to the C2 transection method.
   METHODS: Clinical data were collected from trauma patients who underwent C1 screw fixation for atlantoaxial fusion. Chart review was performed and outcome assessed through telephone surveys to patients who were at least 6 months postoperative. Quality of life, C2 nerve function, neck pain, and head pain were assessed.
   RESULTS: Sixty-six roots were divided in 35 patients. There were no cases of occipital neuralgia at routine 3month follow-up. Delayed telephone surveys were completed in 17 patients and exposed 4 cases of severe head/neck pain but none consistent with occipital neuralgia.
   CONCLUSIONS: C2 neuralgia is rare when sharply dividing the C2 root with the aid of bipolar electrocautery at the midportion of the ganglion where it overlies the C1-2 joint. A literature review suggests the impact of the root sacrifice method is an underappreciated modifiable factor in outcome. In future reports, description of the root transection technique is imperative and trials comparing ganglionectomy versus transection proximal to the ganglion or through the ganglion should be considered.

AB BACKGROUND: Wide-necked intracranial aneurysms present unique treatment challenges in the setting of subarachnoid hemorrhage. New generations of endoluminal devices (stents) have expanded our ability to treat complex aneurysms. The PulseRider Aneurysm Neck Reconstruction Device (PulseRider [Cerenovus, Irvine, California, USA]) is new to the U. S. market after receiving Food and Drug Administration approval in June 2017. Official recommendation for use of the PulseRider is with dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). Its design has been hypothesized to carry a lower risk of thromboembolic complications in the circumstance that DAPT needs to be discontinued.
   METHODS: Between March and June 2018, we treated 4 cases of ruptured wide-necked basilar tip aneurysms at the University of Colorado Hospital, Aurora, Colorado, with PulseRider-assisted coil embolization. Imaging and chart reviews were performed retrospectively on each of these patients.
   RESULTS: All 4 aneurysms were successfully treated with PulseRider-assisted coil embolization. There were no periprocedural hemorrhages and no postprocedural reruptures. Two patients developed nonocclusive thrombi in the posterior cerebral arteries at the time of coiling, which was resolved with intra-arterial glycoprotein IIb/ IIIa receptor antagonists. Two patients developed external ventricular draineassociated hemorrhages, only one of which developed after the administration of DAPT. All patients were eventually discharged to home.
   CONCLUSIONS: The PulseRider device represents a novel design for stent-assisted coil embolization. We report a small but promising series of its successful use in the acute treatment of wide-necked, ruptured basilar artery aneurysms. Additional experience is needed to determine if this device has a place in our armamentarium for treatment of ruptured aneurysms.

   ASSOCIATION; TARGETS
AB OBJECTIVE: The present study was performed to investigate the prognostic role of the preoperative neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in elderly patients with high-grade glioma.
   METHODS: We collected the data from elderly patients (age >= 65 years) who had been diagnosed with high-grade glioma in our hospital from December 2014 to January 2018. The preoperative NLR was evaluated in univariate and multivariate models to examine their effect on overall survival (OS).
   RESULTS: The study included 135 elderly patients (World Health Organization grade III, n = 22; grade IV, n = 113) with a mean age 70.61 +/- 4.60 years. The mean NLR was 3.98 +/- 3.28. The optimal NLR cutoff for predicting OS was 3. Of the 135 patients, 65 (48.1%) had a baseline NLR of >= 3 and 70 (51.9%) a baseline NLR <3. For patients with an NLR of >= 3 and NLR <3, the mean OS was 9.6 months and 17.1 months, respectively. The results showed that age, gender, tumor location, preoperative Karnofsky performance scale score, extent of resection (EOR), and postoperative adjuvant therapy were not associated with the NLR. The tumor grade, neutrophil count, and lymphocyte count were significantly associated with the NLR (P < 0.001). On univariate analysis, tumor grade, preoperative Karnofsky performance scale score >= 80, EOR, frontal tumor, adjuvant radiotherapy plus temozolomide, NLR of >= 3, and lymphocyte count of >= 1.6 x 10(9)/L were significantly associated with OS. On multivariate analysis, tumor grade, EOR, adjuvant radiotherapy plus temozolomide, NLR of >= 3, and lymphocyte count of >= 1.6 x 10(9)/L were still associated with OS after excluded related parameters.
   CONCLUSIONS: A high NLR was an unfavorable predictor of prognosis for elderly patients with high-grade glioma.

AB OBJECTIVE: A prospective trial was conducted to investigate the platelet function and association between thrombelastographic (TEG) parameters and embolic or hemorrhagic complications in patients with intracranial aneurysm undergoing stent treatment.
   METHODS: Between September 2013 and June 2016, we prospectively recruited patients with intracranial aneurysm who were treated with stent-assisted coiling. TEG parameters were used to assess the platelet function before stenting procedures. The primary study end point was the onset of ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, or silent ischemic events in the territory of the stented artery within 6 months after the procedure. The secondary end point was assessed by bleeding events.
   RESULTS: Four hundred and thirty-one patients with 453 intracranial aneurysms were enrolled. A total of 519 neurovascular stents were implanted. During the follow-up, a total of 70 primary end points (16.2%) and 59 secondary end points (13.7%) were detected. Thromboembolic complications such as symptomatic and slient ischemic complications were more frequently observed in patients with large aneurysms (> 10 mm, P [0.01), lower adenosine diphosphate (ADP) inhibition rate (P < 0.0001), and higher ADPinduced platelet-fibrin clot strength (maximum amplitude of adenosine diphosphate [MA-ADP]) (P < 0.0001). Besides, based on multivariate analysis, a higher ADP inhibition ratio was identified as a significant independent predictor of subsequent bleeding events ( P < 0.0001). According to the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the safe range of the ADP inhibition ratio and MA-ADP of the TEG analysis were identified as 29.45%-55.4% and < 46.15, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: The ADP inhibition ratio and MA-ADP of TEG analysis were associated with subsequent cerebral ischemic events and intracranial or extracranial bleeding events in patients with intracranial aneurysm after stent treatment.

TI Harvey Cushing's Influence on Norman Dott's Work on Acromegaly:

   1900-c. 1960
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English

DE Harvey Cushing; Norman Dott; Pituitary adenoma; Trans-sphenoidal
ID SURGERY; HISTORY
AB OBJECTIVE: To review Dr. Harvey Cushing's influence on Mr. Norman Dott's work on acromegaly and other subjects surrounding the pituitary gland such as pituitary research, treatment modalities, and research dissemination. Dott was the first Professor of Neurosurgery in Scotland during 1947 and was considered a pioneer of the understanding and treatment modalities for pituitary disorders such as acromegaly. During 1923, he published an article regarding pituitary physiology that won him the award for the Rockefeller Fellowship Trust, to travel to Boston Massachusetts, giving him the opportunity to train under Cushing's supervision for the years of 1923-1924. However, similarities can be seen between Dott's physiology project that was completed before he ever met Cushing, as well as his treatment suggestions for acromegaly, after he had finished his training under Cushing's supervision.
   METHODS: This was a historical perspective based on literature review. We reviewed Norman Dott's archives held by University of Edinburgh Library or online sources and we compared these with the work Cushing had previously performed in a chronological fashion. Cushing's work on the pituitary gland and acromegaly can be largely found online, in biographical books, and in other secondary sources. The search included words such as "transsphenoidal surgery," "x-ray," "Harvey Cushing," "Norman Dott," "Acromegaly," "Annual Meetings," and "Pituitary physiology." We excluded any primary sources that were not published between 1900 and 1960 regarding either pituitary physiology or the treatments for acromegaly.
   CONCLUSIONS: Sir Norman Dott was the first Professor of Neurosurgery in Scotland during 1947 and is well known for his pioneering work on intracranial aneurysms. Although less well known for his contribution to pituitary pathologies, we would like to share his contribution in this regard and correlate it with Cushing's influence.

AB OBJECTIVE: To analyze the probable causes of failed craniovertebral junction stabilization procedures, and to evaluate the advantages of the Goel technique in revision surgery and the positive factors that lead to reduction of the instability and achieve ultimate arthrodesis.
   METHODS: During the period from January 2010 to June 2018, we treated 30 cases where previous attempt at craniovertebral stabilization with various fixation techniques had failed and the patients presented with progressively worsening neurologic deficits. All patients were re-operated by lateral mass fixation techniques described by the senior author. The technique involved opening of the atlantoaxial joint, denuding the articular cartilage, introduction of bone graft within the articular cavity, and plate and screw fixation. No bone decompression was done.
   RESULTS: Fixation of multiple subaxial spinal segments (n = 9), inclusion of occipital bone in the fixation construct (n = 21), and dependence on metal stabilization rather than bone fusion (n = 19) appear to be important causes of implant failure. All patients improved in clinical symptoms after revision surgery. Postoperative images of all patients demonstrated significant reduction of the atlantoaxial dislocation and craniovertebral junction realignment. During the average follow-up period of 32 months, all reoperated patients continued to show clinical recovery. No further surgery was necessary.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although relatively difficult, when indicated, reoperation and direct stabilization of the atlantoaxial joint can result in significant and enduring clinical recovery.

AB OBJECTIVES: The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) reflects the balance between innate and adaptive inflammatory responses. This study intended to evaluate parameters associated with admission high NLR and its impact on clinical outcome in patients with primary intraventricular hemorrhage (PIVH).
   METHODS: This study retrospectively analyzed consecutive patients with PIVH without a history of head trauma or parenchymal/subarachnoid hemorrhage on computed tomography scan between 2010 and 2016 in a single center. Clinical outcomes at discharge and 90 days were assessed with the modified Rankin Score (mRS) and dichotomized as good (mRS 0-2) and poor (mRS 3-6) outcomes. Associations were estimated using multivariable logistic regression.
   RESULTS: We had 171 patients with PIVH included in the present study. There were 94 male (55.0%) and 77 female (45.0%) patients, with an average age of 46.1 +/- 17.2 years. Multivariable logistic analyses revealed independent associations of high NLR (>= 8.25) with higher Graeb score, Moyamoya disease, higher admission blood glucose level, and lower platelet count. The patients with high NLR had poorer outcome at discharge and 90 days. After adjustment, the patients with high NLR tended to be associated with poor outcome both at discharge and 90 days. In addition, NLR exhibited a superior predictive power of pneumonia in PIVH than absolute neutrophil count and white blood cell count.
   CONCLUSIONS: NLR tended to be associated with 90-day clinical outcomes of patients with PIVH and exhibited independent predictive power for pneumonia in PIVH.

AB OBJECTIVES: To investigate the risk factors in the development of pneumonia and its impact on outcome after primary intraventricular hemorrhage (PIVH).
   METHODS: This is a single-center retrospective study including consecutive patients with PIVH admitted to West China Hospital from 2010 to 2016. Pneumonia was defined according to the modified Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria within 7 days after PIVH onset. Poor outcome (modified Rankin score >= 3) and mortality at discharge and at 90 days were analyzed.
   RESULTS: Among the included 174 patients, pneumonia occurred in 13 (7.5%) patients. Patients with pneumonia had lower Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score (P = 0.001) and greater Graeb score (P = 0.001) at admission, presented more often with acute hydrocephalus (P = 0.04) and greater rates with stroke history (P = 0.002), and harbored greater admission blood glucose (P = 0.01) and absolute neutrophil counts (P = 0.02). In a multivariable analysis, only GCS score and stroke history were independent predictors of pneumonia after PIVH. The patients with pneumonia had longer duration of hospital stay (P = 0.002) and poorer outcome (P = 0.02) at 90 days. However, after adjustment for confounders, pneumonia after PIVH was not an independent predictor of poor outcome at 90 days.
   CONCLUSIONS: GCS score and stroke history were independent predictors of pneumonia development after PIVH. Pneumonia after PIVH was associated with longer duration of hospital stay and poorer outcome at 90 days.

   EMBOLUS; SAFETY
AB BACKGROUND: Advances in acute and long-term post-stroke care have resulted in improved survival and functional outcomes for patients who have suffered large vessel ischemic strokes. For years, tissue plasminogen activator was the mainstay of treatment for acute stroke. Its use was previously limited to patients without known comorbid intracranial vascular pathology because of concern for bleeding risk. More recently, however, the use of tissue plasminogen activator in select patients with vascular anomalies has increased and is now largely thought to be safe. With the safety and efficacy of mechanical thrombectomy now proven for large vessel occlusions (LVOs), similar investigation is needed to assess procedural safety in patients with concomitant arteriovenous (AV) malformations or fistulae.
   METHODS: We reviewed patients treated for LVOs at our institution and those of our collaborators and identified 6 patients who were treated for LVO with either known or incidentally identified concomitant AV malformations or dural AV fistulae.
   RESULTS: We present a case series of 6 patients with nonaneurysmal intracranial vascular lesions who underwent mechanical thrombectomy for LVO without complications related to these lesions.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although limited by small size, our series adds to the literature evidence that mechanical thrombectomy for LVO can safely be performed with concomitant dural AV fistulae and AV malformations.

TI Surgical Practice in Traumatic Spinal Fracture Treatment with Regard to

AB OBJECTIVES: Spine surgeons at a Level 1 Trauma Center have observed a high incidence of spine and spinal cord injuries owing to falls from tree stands. These injuries have been retrospectively reviewed in the context of the Thoracolumbar Injury Classification and Severity (TLICS) and the Subaxial Cervical Injury Classification and Severity (SLICS) classification systems to assess inter-user reliability and validity. We hypothesize that the inter-rater reliability will be similar between neuroradiology and neurosurgery raters and validity of the scoring system will be maintained at our institution.
   METHODS: The University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics' trauma database was reviewed for tree stande related injuries from 1999 to 2013, with a focus on patients suffering from spine and spinal cord injuries. The TLICS and SLICS scores were then independently determined for these injuries by a neurosurgeon and a neuroradiologist.
   RESULTS: When cases were grouped by management recommendation (operative, equivocal, and nonoperative) reviewer agreement was 12/15 (80%) of SLICS and 38/52 (73%) of TLICS scores. Operative SLICS positive predictive value reached 100%, however, with a wide confidence interval. Conversely, the SLICS negative predictive value was poor at 54% e60%, with frequent operative treatment for patients assigned nonoperative scores. TLICS scores reached 77.8% and 93.3% positive predictive value per reviewer, whereas negative predictive values reached 93.9% and 89.2%, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: The TLICS and SLICS systems provide good-to-excellent inter-rater reliability. SLICS validity was poor, whereas TLICS was reasonable for nonoperative cases and moderate for operative cases. Systems such as the TLICS and the SLICS may be best applied in the educational setting to confirm the fracture morphology and presence or absence of ligamentous injury between surgeons and radiologists.

TI Cortical Venous Reddening Predicts Remote Cerebral Infarction Post

DT Article
DE Bypass surgery; Red vein; Selective neuronal loss
ID MISERY-PERFUSION; ISCHEMIC-STROKE; NEURONAL DAMAGE; SURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: The superficial temporal artery (STA)-middle cerebral artery (MCA) anastomosis (STA-MCA bypass) currently is performed to prevent atherosclerotic occlusive cerebrovascular disease. However, the benefits of the bypass surgery remain controversial. To ensure consistent surgical benefits, understanding the mechanisms of perioperative cerebral infarction (CI) is required. Moreover, appropriate patient selection procedures must be determined to decrease the rate of perioperative stroke. We retrospectively investigated patients who underwent bypass surgery at our institution and determined that the patients who presented with cortical venous reddening after anastomosis during the surgery developed perioperative CI.
   METHODS: A total of 45 consecutive patients who underwent bypass surgery were retrospectively investigated. Twenty-five of the 45 patients underwent bypass for atherosclerotic occlusion or stenosis of the internal carotid artery or middle cerebral artery. Preoperative iodine-123-N-isopropyl-iodoamphetamine single-photon emission computed tomography was performed with and without acetazolamide administration. Change in color of the cortical veins was observed on recorded surgical videos, and its correlation with perioperative CI was investigated.
   RESULTS: We experienced 2 cases of perioperative extensive CI at a region remote from the site of anastomosis. In both cases, retrospective investigation of surgical videos demonstrated reddening of cortical veins soon after the anastomosis procedure. Of all 45 patients, postoperative CI and venous reddening were observed in only these 2 cases.
   CONCLUSIONS: We determined that patients presenting with cortical venous reddening after anastomosis developed perioperative CI. Cortical venous reddening may be an important predictor for the occurrence of CI after STA-MCA bypass surgery for patients with atherosclerotic occlusive cerebrovascular disease.

AB OBJECTIVE: Generators implanted for deep brain stimulation must be replaced after several years. If a Kinetra generator is replaced by the Activa-PC, an adaptor will be required to attach it to the original extension cables. On the basis of our clinical impression that the battery life of the Active-PC generator was shorter when an adaptor was used, we performed this retrospective study.
   METHODS: We determined the battery lifetimes of deep brain stimulation generators that had been implanted in our department. The inclusion criterion was the initial implantation of a Kinetra generator that was later replaced by an Activa-PC with adaptor, which itself was subsequently also replaced. These patients were compared with an Activa-PC control group without an adaptor but identical with regard to number of battery exchanges, disease, and target.
   RESULTS: There were 28 patients in the study group and 14 in the control group. Battery lifetime of the Activa-PC with adaptor (32.4 +/- 7.7 months) was significantly shorter than that of the Kinetra (53.5 +/- 15.7 months, P = 0.000006). The battery life of Activa-PC without an adaptor (35.3 +/- 8.2 months) did not differ significantly from that of the Activa-PC with an adaptor (P = 0.333).
   CONCLUSIONS: The battery lifetime in a replacement Activa-PC is shorter than that in the original Kinetra generator. Adaptors have no significant effect on battery life. Patients should be informed that the battery in their new generator must be checked more frequently than before.

AB BACKGROUND: Corpus callosum (CC) infarction has been reported to be rare because of the rich blood supply in the CC. The pathophysiology of CC infarction associated with acute hydrocephalus is unknown. The aim of the present study was to clarify the characteristics and mechanism of CC infarction associated with acute noncommunicating hydrocephalus (ANCH).
   METHODS: We reviewed clinical the data from all patients who had undergone surgical intervention for ANCH at Chiba University Hospital from January 2008 to March 2018. Patients with vascular lesions, a history of hydrocephalus, and lacking magnetic resonance imaging studies were excluded. The clinical, surgical, and radiological parameters were obtained retrospectively for pathophysiological analysis.
   RESULTS: A total of 23 patients with ANCH who had undergone surgical intervention and had met the inclusion criteria were included in the present study. Of the 23 patients, 6 (23%) had developed CC infarction. All CC infarctions were located in the splenium. Although no clinical or surgical features were associated with splenial infarction, the radiological parameters of lateral ventricle enlargement and a narrower callosal angle at the posterior commissure and the foramen of Monro were significantly associated with splenial infarction.
   CONCLUSION: The present study has presented evidence that increased intraventricular pressure by ANCH applied transversely in the splenium will directly induce compression of the superior branch of the posterior callosal artery and pericallosal pial plexus, resulting in splenium-specific infarction in patients with ANCH.

   CLASSIFICATION; SYSTEM
AB BACKGROUND: Cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) severity and presence of symptoms are often difficult to predict based simply on clinical imaging alone. Similarly, improved machine learning techniques provide new tools with immense clinical potential.
   METHODS: A total of 14 patients with CSM and 14 controls underwent imaging of the cervical spine. Two different artificial neural network models were trained; 1) to predict CSM diagnosis; and 2) to predict CSM severity. Model 1 consisted of 6 inputs including 3 common imaging scales for the evaluation of cord compression, alongside 3 objective magnetic resonance imaging measurements. The outcome for model 1 was binary to predict CSM diagnosis. Model 2 consisted of 23 input variables derived from probabilistic volume mapping measurements of white matter tracts in the region of compression. The outcome of model 2 was linear, to predict the modified Japanese Orthopedic Association (mJOA) score.
   RESULTS: Model 1 was used in predicting CSM. The mean cross-validated accuracy of the trained model was 86.50% (95% confidence interval, 85.16%-87.83%) with a median accuracy of 90.00%. Area under the curve (AUC) was calculated for each repetition. Average AUC for each repetition was 0.947 with a median AUC of 1.0. Average sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 90.25%, 85.05%, 81.58%, and 91.94%, respectively. Model 2 was used in modeling mJOA. The mJOA model predicted scores, with a mean and median error of -0.29 mJOA points and -0.08 mJOA points, respectively, mean error per batch was 0.714 mJOA points.
   CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning provides a promising method for prediction, diagnosis, and even prognosis in patients with CSM.

AB BACKGROUND: Transvenous embolization (TVE) via occluded sinus is one option for the treatment of dural arteriovenous fistulas. Understanding of the anatomical characteristics of the occluded sinus is difficult. It is often hard to reach the shunt point because of some risk of vessel perforation.
   METHODS: We assessed usefulness of T1 Volumetric Isotropic TSE Acquisition (VISTA) Black Blood (BB) and 3D-T1 Fast Field Echo (FFE) for the evaluation and visualization of an occluded sinus. Evaluation of T1 VISTA BB and 3D-T1 FFE was performed preoperatively. TVE was performed via the occluded sinus while referring to the visualized reconstruction image.
   RESULTS: Fourteen cases of TVE were performed between 2009 and 2015. The entire occluded sinus, including both thrombus and blood flow, was seen as the high-intensity region on 3D FFE T1 gadlinium (Gd). On the other hand, thrombus was seen as the iso- or high-intensity region and blood flow as the low-intensity region on T1 VISTA BB. The maximum intensity projection reconstruction image of 3D FFE T1Gd could visualize the whole occluded sinus and was useful for microcatheter maneuver. Total shunt obliteration was achieved in 13 cases (92.8%) except for one.
   CONCLUSIONS: Magnetic resonance imaging evaluation of the occluded sinus using both T1 VISTA BB and 3D FFE T1Gd gives us valuable information of the occluded sinus regarding the development and the course of the occluded sinus, the length of the thrombotic occlusion, and leads to safer catheter maneuvers in TVE.

AB BACKGROUND: Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and carotid artery stenting (CAS) are well-established treatments that have been shown to decrease stroke recurrence in patients with underlying carotid artery disease. We assessed clinical outcome, safety, and restenosis rates for patients who underwent standardized CEA or CAS at our tertiary care center using patient selection criteria based on available scientific evidence.
   METHODS: Retrospective chart review of patients who underwent CEA or CAS between 2009 and 2016.
   RESULTS: In total, 314 cases (204 with CEA and 110 with CAS) were analyzed. Patients were predominantly white (84.4%), men (61.1%) with hypertension (86.9%) and hyperlipidemia (81.8%). Most patients (84.5%) had symptomatic carotid disease. No significant differences were observed in median postoperative National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and modified Rankin scale (mRS) scores based on pretreatment symptomatic status or treatment modality (CEA vs. CAS). Most patients (85.9%) had favorable outcomes (mRS score 0-2) at a median follow-up of 11.7 months (interquartile range, 1.8-28.8). The perioperative complication rate was low (3.2%), and permanent neurologic deficit was seen in only 3 patients (1%). Restenosis was found in 7.3%, without significant difference between CEA and CAS at last follow-up. Restenosis was asymptomatic in most patients.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our findings in a real-world predominantly symptomatic cohort demonstrate that favorable patient outcomes and low restenosis and complication rates can be achieved with both CEA and CAS by the utilization of a consistent institutional patient selection and treatment process.

AB BACKGROUND: Multimodal intraoperative neuro-monitoring (IONM) has been proposed as an effective way to reduce permanent neurologic injury during spinal deformity surgery. However, few studies have reported evoked potential changes at different surgical stages of thoracic posterior vertebral column resection (PVCR).
   METHODS: A total of 82 cases with severe thoracic deformity (Yang's A type) treated by PVCR in a single institution between January 2010 and March 2015 were reviewed. Multimodal IONM including somatosensory evoked potential, motor evoked potential, and descending neurogenic evoked potential was performed for real-time assessment of spinal cord function during surgery. The risk factors of neuromonitoring events at different surgical stages were documented and analyzed.
   RESULTS: Multimodal IONM was successfully performed in all 82 cases. Thirty-nine neuromonitoring events presented in 27 (32.9%) cases. Neurologic monitoring events were more likely to occur in patients with larger scoliosis and kyphosis, longer osteotomy closure distance, more Halo gravity traction, more screw insertion, and higher PVCR segments. The reasons for monitoring changes included 6 events during screw insertion, 20 during osteotomy, 9 during osteotomy gap closure, and 4 during deformity correction. New postoperative neurologic deficits were observed in 11 (13.4%) cases including 1 incomplete paraplegia, 8 transient cord deficits, and 2 nerve root injuries.
   CONCLUSIONS: Multimodal IONM can effectively identify neurologic deficits throughout surgery. Osteotomy and osteotomy gap closure are the surgical stages with the highest neurologic risks during PVCR procedures. It is imperative to improve dexterity since the majority of neuromonitoring events are caused by surgical techniques.

AB OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the influence of prophylactic anticonvulsive medication, above all levetiracetam monotherapy, in predicting the cognitive outcome of neurosurgical patients with post-traumatic brain injury, intracerebral hemorrhage, and encephalic tumors.
   METHODS: We examined data concerning 232 of 327 adult patients admitted to the Neurorehabilitation Department of the San Raffaele Hospital (Milan, Italy) after discharge from the Neurosurgery Department. Cognitive status was evaluated by means of the "Mini-Mental State" examination and the Functional Independence Measure at baseline and at the end of a rehabilitation care with an average duration of about four weeks.
   RESULTS: The vast majority of the patients were treated with levetiracetam. Our data showed a negative role of antiepileptic drugs on cognitive recovery in a cohort of neurosurgical patients.
   CONCLUSIONS: Knowing thoroughly the effects of anti-epileptic drugs in rehabilitation outcome is of fundamental importance. This study represents the only large series analyzing these aspects in the rehabilitation of neurosurgical patients. Antiepileptic drugs should be managed to ensure patients the best possible cognitive outcome. Further evidence from good-quality trials is required to assess the clinical effectiveness of prophylactic anticonvulsive medication in predicting the cognitive outcome of neurosurgical patients who are treated with rehabilitation.

AB BACKGROUND: The effect of HydroSoft coils on the prevention of recanalization and thrombosis after embolization is unclear. We herein report the results of the single-armed prospective Japanese HydroSoft Registry.
   METHODS: Aneurysms with a diameter of <10 mm that were treated with a >= 50% length of HydroSoft coils were registered. We evaluated the safety and recanalization rate and analyzed the factors related to their recanalization and thrombosis 1 year later.
   RESULTS: In total, 122 aneurysms were registered. Their mean maximum diameter and neck length were 6.4 and 3.9 mm, respectively. The mean length of the HydroSoft coils was 84.3%. No intracranial hemorrhage occurred, but 2 patients developed minor ischemic strokes. Angiographic examination immediately after the procedure showed complete obliteration, neck remnant (NR), and body filling (BF) in 20 (16.4%), 32 (26.2%), and 67 (54.9%) cases, respectively. One-year follow-up angiography showed complete obliteration, NR, and BF in 68 (55.7%), 15 (12.3%), and 15 (12.3%) cases, respectively, and 5 aneurysms (4.1%) were recanalized (4 and 1 with BF and NR as their initial angiographic result, respectively). Another 11 aneurysms still showed BF, although their thrombosis was promoted. No significant factors related to recanalization were identified. A high volume embolization ratio and small neck were significantly associated with thrombosis 1 year after embolization with HydroSoft coils.
   CONCLUSIONS: The safety and prevention of recanalization 1 year after the treatment appeared acceptable. The high volume embolization ratio associated with HydroSoft coils could induce progression of thrombosis for aneurysms characterized by NR and BF during the follow-up period.

AB BACKGROUND: Neurosurgery for lesions located the mesial frontoparietal region and cingulate gyrus may need significant brain retraction, which may cause neural injury. Therefore, the goal of this anatomic study was to evaluate a contralateral transfalcine approach to these regions.
   METHODS: Eight adult cadaver heads were used in this study. An 8 x 8 cm craniotomy was performed, and bilateral longitudinal incisions were made into the dura mater adjacent to the superior sagittal sinus. Measurements were then taken to see how much retraction was necessary for an ipsilateral approach to the mesial frontoparietal region down to the cingulate gyrus and compared with measurements using a contralateral transfalcine approach to this same region.
   RESULTS: Ipsilateral approaches required 1.5 to 3 cm of lateral retraction (40-50 degrees) from the midline, whereas contralateral transfalcine approaches required 0.5 to 1 cm of lateral retraction (10-20 degrees).
   CONCLUSION: In comparison with the traditional ipsilateral interhemispheric approach to lesions of the mesial frontoparietal region and cingulate gyrus, the contralateral transfalcine approach was found to necessitate less hemispheric retraction and provided a better working angle. Clinical validation of this technique is now necessary.

AB OBJECTIVE: There are few reports on the relationship between carotid artery stenting (CAS) and frailty. In this study, medium-term outcome after CAS in patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis was examined to see the effect of frailty itself.
   METHODS: A retrospective study was performed in 71 consecutive patients who were treated with CAS for asymptomatic lesions from January 2007 to June 2014. In this study, only patients without neurologic symptoms before treatment were included. Frailty was defined on the basis of the presence of >= 2 of the 5 items on the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) Index. The relationship of frailty with a composite endpoint of the incidence of stroke, disease requiring hospital admission, and death for 3 years after CAS was examined.
   RESULTS: There were 23 cases (average age 73.9 years, median CHS index 3) with frailty and 48 (average age 70.9 years, median CHS index 0) without frailty. There were no differences in comorbidities or CAS perioperative complications between these groups. However, there was a significantly higher incidence of the composite endpoint in patients with frailty (13/23 vs. 4/48, P < 0.001), and in multivariate analysis, frailty was strongly associated with this endpoint (odds ratio 28.24, 95% confidence interval 4.62-172.71).
   CONCLUSIONS: In CAS conducted for asymptomatic lesions, perioperative complications had no relationship with frailty. However, frailty is likely to be associated with lower activity of daily life in the medium term after CAS, and consideration of underlying diseases is required in patients with frailty.

ID HOSPITAL READMISSIONS; DEFORMITY; RESECTION; FUSION; LASSO
AB OBJECTIVE: A fair number of hospital admissions occur after 30 days; thus, the true readmission rate could have been underestimated. Therefore, we hypothesized that the 90-day readmission rate might better characterize the factors contributing to readmission for pediatric patients undergoing spinal tumor resection.
   METHODS: The Nationwide Readmissions Database was used to study the patient demographic data, comorbidities, admissions, hospital course, spinal tumor behavior (malignant vs. benign), complications, revisions, and 30-and 90-day readmissions.
   RESULTS: Of the 397 patients included in the 30-day cohort, 43 (10.8%) had been readmitted. In comparison, the 90-day readmission rate was significantly greater; 52 of 325 patients were readmitted (16.0%; P < 0.04). Patients aged 16-20 constituted the largest subgroup. However, the highest readmission rate was observed for patients aged <5 years (30-day, 21.7%; 90-day, 26.4%). Medicaid patients were more likely to be readmitted than were private insurance patients (30-day odds ratio [OR], 3.3 [P < 0.001]; 90-day OR, 2.29 [P < 0.02]). In both cohorts, patients with malignant tumors required readmission more often than did those with benign tumors (30-day OR, 2.78 [P < 0.02]; 90-day OR, 1.92 [P = 0.08]). In the 90-day cohort, the patients had been readmitted 26.4 days after discharge versus 10.6 days in the 30-day cohort. Within the 90-day cohort, 18.6% of the readmissions were tot spinal reoperation, 28.3% for chemotherapy or hematologic complications, and 25.6% for other central nervous system disorders. The median charges for each readmission were similar to$50,000 and similar to$40,000 for the 30- and 90-day cohorts, respectively. Medicaid insurance, malignant tumors, and younger age were significant predictors of readmission in the 90-day cohort.
   CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence and charges associated with unplanned hospital readmissions after spinal tumor resection were remarkably high. Younger age, Medicaid insurance, malignant tumors, and complications during the initial admission were significant predictors of 90-day readmission.

AB OBJECTIVE: Fracture of the odontoid process is a critical injury to diagnose and often treat. The aim of this anatomic study was to present a comprehensive understanding of this part of the C2 vertebra.
   METHODS: We used 20 C2 vertebrae. Samples underwent imaging (computed tomography [CT] with and without three-dimensional reconstruction, micro-CT, 1.5T magnetic resonance imaging) and sagittal and coronal sectioning using a bone saw. Sectioned specimens were imaged under a digital handheld microscope, and transillumination of the bone was used to highlight its internal trabecular pattern. Three samples underwent infusion of the odontoid process with a hardening substance and were then decalcified.
   RESULTS: Internal trabecular patterns of the odontoid process of all specimens were discernible. In sagittal and coronal sections, trabecular patterns were highlighted with transillumination, but the patterns were much clearer using the digital microscope. Magnetic resonance imaging and CT provided the least detail of the imaging methods, but the trabecular patterns could he identified. Three-dimensional reconstruction of CT data was the preferred imaging method over magnetic resonance imaging and CT without three-dimensional reconstruction. The most distinct trabecular and cortical patterns were seen using micro-CT. Osteoporosis was seen in 2 specimens (10%). Five specimens (25%) were found to have a subdental synchondrosis. For most specimens, the trabeculae were found throughout the odontoid process.
   CONCLUSIONS: Improved knowledge of the anatomy, structural composition, and variations within the C2 vertebra may allow for better treatment options and patient care.

AB BACKGROUND: Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) has demonstrated benefit in patients with acute ischemic stroke due to proximal large-vessel occlusion. However, it is unclear whether these results can be extrapolated to patients with an occlusion of the second segment (M2) of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). We sought to study outcomes in patients with M2 occlusion treated with MT and to better understand clinical predictors of these outcomes.
   METHODS: We performed a single-center retrospective analysis of consecutive patients with acute MCA M2 segment occlusion who underwent stent retriever MT. We correlated clinical and radiographic outcomes with demographic, clinical, and technical characteristics.
   RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients were included in the analysis (median admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS] score, 15 [12-19], mean age 74 [67-80] years, 48.6% women). Good clinical outcome at 3 months (modified Rankin Scale <= 2) was achieved in 48.6% of patients. Baseline NIHSS was a predictor of clinical outcomes, based on modified Rankin Scale distribution at 3 months after MT (P = 0.015, odds ratio 1.63, 95% confidence interval 1.01-2.43).
   CONCLUSIONS: The results of our single-institution experience suggest that MT-based endovascular therapy for M2 occlusions is safe and effective. Baseline NIHSS was a predictor of outcomes in patients treated with MT for M2 segment occlusion of the MCA.

AB BACKGROUND: Neurosurgery is a unique field, which would benefit greatly from increased global collaboration, furthering research efforts. ResearchGate is a social media platform geared toward scientists and researchers.
   OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the use of ResearchGate for neurosurgical research collaboration and compared the ResearchGate score with more classic bibliometrics. ResearchGate is a unifying social platform that can strengthen global research collaboration (e.g., data sharing) in the neurosurgery community.
   METHODS: Publicly available metrics on 3718 neurosurgery clinical faculty and residents in Canada and the United States were obtained from the American Association of Neurological Surgeons Web site. The following metrics were collected: program name, clinician name, sex, attending (yes or no), resident (yes or no), postgraduate year (if resident), and ResearchGate profile (yes or no). ResearchGate score and its components and h index excluding self-citations were collected. Fellows were not included.
   RESULTS: Of the 3718 total individuals included, 1338 (36.0%) were present on ResearchGate, comprising 181 women (13.5%) and 1157 men (86.5%). Women and men were present in similar proportions (33.8% of women and 36.3% of men) (chi(2) [1, N = 3718] = 126; P = 026). More faculty were present on ResearchGate than residents (62.4%) (chi(2) [1, N = 3718] = 11.42; P = 0.001). A strong positive monotonic correlation between h index and ResearchGate score was shown (r(s) [1292] = 0.93; P < 0.0005). More than 400 international departments were determined.
   CONCLUSIONS: ResearchGate may be a useful platform to increase neurosurgical networking and research collaboration. Its novel bibliometrics are strongly correlated with more classic platforms.

AB OBJECTIVE: Corkscrew (CS) electrodes are usually used for transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) in the intraoperative monitoring of motor evoked potentials (MEP). Direct cranial stimulation with peg-screw (PS) electrodes can elicit MEP. The present study investigated the difference in the initial threshold between PS and CS electrodes for intraoperative MEP monitoring.
   METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed TES-MEP monitoring for supratentorial surgery in 72 patients. Of these 72 patients, 44 were monitored with PS and CS electrodes (PS/CS group) and 28 were monitored with CS and CS electrodes (CS/CS group). TES was used to deliver electrical stimulation by a train of 4-pulse anodel constant current stimulation. The initial threshold in each electrode was checked and analyzed.
   RESULTS: In the PS/CS group, the initial threshold with the PS electrode was 38.3 +/- 15.1 mA (mean +/- standard deviation) on the affected side, and the initial threshold with the CS electrode was 51.4 +/- 13.9 mA on the unaffected side. The initial threshold with the PS electrode was significantly lower than that with the CS electrode (P = 0.0001). In the CS/CS group, the initial threshold was 56.2 +/- 16.5 mA on the affected side and 62.1 +/- 18.6 mA on the unaffected side, with no statistically significant difference (P = 0.23).
   CONCLUSION: The initial threshold to elicit MEP was significantly lower with the PS electrode than with the CS electrode. A PS electrode can be used as a feasible stimulation electrode for TES-MEP.

ID COHERENCE TOMOGRAPHY; PITUITARY-ADENOMA; RECOVERY; VISION; POTENTIALS;
   SYSTEM
AB BACKGROUND: Postoperative visual recovery is a major concern after transsphenoidal surgery. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) can visualize the anatomy of the retina, and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thinning reflects loss of optic nerve axons. Visual-evoked potential (VEP) is an electrophysiological response that confirms the nerve conductance. Therefore, these factors reflecting the optic nerve condition may be closely associated with the visual outcome after transsphenoidal surgery.
   METHODS: A total of 124 eyes in 62 patients with sellar tumor who underwent transsphenoidal surgery were included. The following variables were retrospectively analyzed: age, sex, tumor diameter, histology, symptom duration, history of rapid deterioration, optic disc atrophy on fundoscopy, peripapillary RNFL thickness on OCT, and latency and reproducibility of the VEP waveform.
   RESULTS: Four eyes were excluded for no visual disturbance in 3 and glaucoma aggravation in 1. Eighty-three eyes manifested visual improvement, 37 revealed no change, and none showed postoperative deterioration. Univariate analysis demonstrated that thick RNFL of the inferior and temporal quadrants, reproducible VEP waveform, short symptom duration, histologic diagnosis of pituitary adenoma, and small tumor diameter were associated with good visual recovery. Multivariate analysis showed RNFL thickness of the temporal quadrant had significant association with visual recovery (P = 0.03).
   CONCLUSIONS: OCT is a useful diagnostic modality to assess optic nerve condition, and RNFL thickness of the temporal quadrant is correlated with visual outcome after transsphenoidal surgery. Patients with severe visual disturbance may still achieve visual recovery, so surgery should be considered even if optic disc atrophy is evident.

AB BACKGROUND: Brain metastases (BMs) are classically well-circumscribed lesions. Still, the amount of edema in these neoplasms suggests either mechanisms of infiltration or defense. A better understanding of the mechanisms within the edema of BMs seems reasonable to preoperatively identify areas of potential infiltration and resect them. BMs represent tumors with high energy demand and cell turnover; therefore, they qualify for preoperative investigation with phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31PMRS), which reveals information about those characteristics.
   METHODS: Ten patients with BMs were included in this trial. All underwent preoperative standard magnetic resonance imaging with additional 31PMRS. In all patients, 1 voxel within the contrast-enhancing tumor (CE+), 1 voxel at the border (including CE+ areas and surrounding T2-hyperintensive [T2+] areas), and 1 distant voxel purely including T2+ areas were determined by a neuroradiologist and a neurosurgeon. A frameless stereotactic biopsy was performed after craniotomy. Subsequently, the metabolites of the 31PMRS were analyzed and compared with the histopathologic results.
   RESULTS: Ratios, reflecting resynthesis (CE+/border/T2+: 1.109 +/- 0.192/1.112 +/- 0.158/1.083 +/- 0.097), hydrolysis (0.303 +/- 0.089/0.360 +/- 0.122/0.321 +/- 0.089), energy demand (4.227 +/- 2.35/3.453 +/- 1.284/3.599 +/- 0.833), and membrane turnover (1.239 +/- 0.2611/3.453 +/- 1.284/3.599 +/- 0.283) were calculated and compared intraindividually with a voxel from the contralateral side (resynthesis/hydrolysis/energy demand/membrane turnover: 1.063 +/- 0.085/0.335 +/- 0.073/3.317 +/- 0.7573/0.784 +/- 0.186), respectively. Resynthesis showed a trend toward higher ratios in CE+ and border biopsies without reaching statistical significances. This trend was also seen concerning energy demand. Membrane turnover was significantly higher in CE+, border zone, and also in the T2+ areas compared with controls (P > 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: 31PMRS in BMs provides information on metabolic changes in tumor and surrounding edema. There is proof of enhanced metabolism in tissue without histologic tumor manifestation.

ID ENTRAPMENT NEUROPATHY; SUPERIOR
AB OBJECTIVE: The middle cluneal nerves (MCNs) are stated to arise from the sacral dorsal rami of S1 to S3 and supply the gluteal skin, but their detailed anatomy is unclear and often variably depicted and described. Therefore, the goal of this study was to revisit the anatomy of the MCNs and provide a clearer picture of their morphology.
   METHODS: Five fresh-frozen Caucasian cadavers (10 sides) (2 men and 3 women) were dissected for this study. The sacral dorsal rami from each posterior sacral foramen were identified and traced laterally to identify the MCNs. The contribution, pathway, and distribution of the MCNs were investigated.
   RESULTS: Each sacral dorsal ramus joined to form the posterior sacrococcygeal plexus. A total of 25 MCNs were identified. The MCNs were formed by the sacral dorsal rami of S1-2 in 48% (12/25), S1-3 in 4% (1/25), S1-4 in 20% (5/25), S2-3 in 8% (2/25), and S2-4 in 20% (5/25). The MCNs pierced the gluteus maximus by 2 different pathways and supplied the gluteal skin or the gluteus maximus muscle.
   CONCLUSIONS: We clarified the anatomy and variations of the MCNs and revisited its current nomenclature. Such knowledge might improve diagnoses and invasive procedure outcomes in patients with pathology in the region of the MCNs.

TI Predictors of Impaired Cerebral Perfusion After How Diversion Therapy
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Flow diversion therapy; Hyperperfusion; Hypoperfusion
ID SMOKING; STENTS
AB BACKGROUND: Flow-diverting stents (FDS) are relatively safe and highly efficacious in treating cerebral aneurysms; however, a small subset of patients experience devastating hemorrhagic complications owing to presumed alterations in local aneurysm and distal cerebral blood flow. The downstream effects of FDS on distal cerebral blood flow is not well understood, but isolated reports of hyperperfusion injury have been described in the literature. We investigate the incidence and clinical factors contributing to abnormal cerebral blood flow after FDS placement.
   METHODS: A retrospective analysis of patients undergoing FDS for elective aneurysm treatment between 2014-2017 was performed. Patients who underwent perfusion imaging within 24-hours posttreatment were included for further analysis. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess the impact of multiple variables on the postoperative perfusion changes.
   RESULTS: A total of 69 patients underwent FDS therapy to treat unruptured intracranial aneurysms. Thirteen patients (18.8%) developed abnormal perfusion changes. A significant difference of the median was found in aneurysm projection width, depth, neck width, calculated approximate volume, and size ratio between the hypoperfused, normal, and hyperperfusion cases. On multivariate analysis, history of smoking (P = 0.0117), and approximate calculated volume (P = 0.0145) were significant predictors of hyperperfusion identified on posttreatment imaging.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study yielded several novel findings. We demonstrate that cerebral blood flow alterations will occur in a significant subset of patients undergoing FDS treatment. We also provide new evidence that aneurysm volume and history of smoking may predict the developing of postoperative perfusion anomalies. Future studies are needed to evaluate the clinical ramifications of cerebral blood flow disruption in large prospective studies.

AB OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the characteristics of A1 aneurysms according to their locations and to compare their imaging appearances so as to identify factors associated with their rupture.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 31 patients harboring 32 A1 aneurysms diagnosed and treated between March 2009 and September 2018 at our institute.
   RESULTS: Thirteen (41.9%) of the patients had vascular abnormalities, and multiple aneurysms were found in 13 (41.9%) patients. A total of 16 (53.3%) aneurysms were located on the proximal A1 segment, whereas the middle segments were affected in 7 (23.3%) and the distal segments in 7 (23.3%). Altogether, 93.8% of proximal A1 aneurysms projected posteriorly, 85.7% of middle aneurysms projected superiorly, and 85.7% of distal aneurysms projected inferiorly (P = 0.000). Four (33.3%) of the 12 total ruptured aneurysms were located on the distal A1 segment. Nine (69.2%) ruptured aneurysms were elongated or irregular in shape (P = 0.004). The aspect and height-width ratios of the ruptured aneurysms were higher than those of the unruptured aneurysms (P = 0.001, P = 0.018, respectively).
   CONCLUSIONS: Most A1 aneurysms showed a directional predilection according to the location of the A1 segment. Additionally, A1 aneurysms with elongated or irregular shapes, high aspect or height-width ratios, and distal locations of the A1 segment showed high risks of rupture. Therefore, a thorough assessment of the characteristics of A1 aneurysms can enhance the selection of proper treatment strategies.

AB BACKGROUND: The combined transpetrosal approach is a complicated skull base surgery with a high degree of difficulty. Herein, we made a 3-dimensional (3D) printed petrous bone with color-coded anatomic sites and evaluated its usefulness as a model to practice drilling associated with combined transpetrosal surgery.
   METHODS: To design a 3D model of the petrous bone, we chose a representative epidermoid petroclival tumor case who underwent combined transpetrosal surgery at our hospital. A 3D image of the petrous bone embedded with color-coded anatomic sites, including cranial nerves, brainstem, and internal carotid and vertebrobasilar arteries, was created based on preoperative computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance, and digital subtraction angiography images and was then 3D printed. Thirteen neurosurgeons from our department evaluated the anatomic reproducibility and estimated distance between each anatomic site of the 3D image and model and the usefulness of the model for drilling practice.
   RESULTS: The anatomic reproducibility of both the 3D image and model was high, and the 3D model was considered good for drilling practice (P < 0.05). The error in the estimated distance between anatomic sites in the 3D model was significantly smaller than that of the 3D image (P< 0.0001).
   CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that our 3D printed model is very useful for practice with craniotomy and petrosectomy drilling, necessary in the combined transpetrosal approach.

TI Vascular Offenders in Trigeminal Neuralgia: A Unified Classification and
   Assessment of the Outcome of Microvascular Decompression
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Atypical pain; Microvascular decompression; Outcome; Primary trigeminal
   neuralgia; Unusual offenders
ID NEUROVASCULAR COMPRESSION; SURGERY; NERVE; RATES
AB BACKGROUND: Vascular loop compression remains the most accepted theory for trigeminal neuralgia (TN). Apart from the normal adjoining vascular loops, certain unusual vascular loops incriminated in TN such as vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia and pure venous compressions do not truly fit into the traditional classification. Moreover, vascular diseases such as cavernoma and aneurysms causing TN are considered as secondary TNs. There is a lack of unified classification for TN with underlying vascular offenders, otherwise amenable to microvascular decompression.
   METHODS: We classified vascular offenders in TN (n = 53) into the usual offenders such as superior cerebellar artery or anterior inferior cerebellar artery loop with (n = 4) or without (n = 34) superior petrosal vein loop (n = 38, group I). The unusual vascular offenders (n = 15, group II) comprised unusual arterial loops (n = 4, IIa), pure venous compressions (n = 8, IIb) and vascular diseases (n = 3, IIc). The clinical symptoms, pain severity scores, and surgical outcomes were compared.
   RESULTS: A right-sided preference and male predominance typified the unusual group. The incidence of atypical pain and sensory impairment was higher in group II. Group II also showed a less favorable immediate pain outcome, particularly the patients in group IIb. Group IIb also showed a higher incidence of postoperative hemorrhagic complications. However, long-term outcomes did not differ significantly.
   CONCLUSIONS: Unusual vascular offenders in TN do constitute a significant population. They differ from the usual group with respect to the type of pain, gender, and side of involvement and tend to have more complications with similar pain outcomes after microvascular decompression.

AB BACKGROUND: Primary melanocytic neoplasms (PMNs) are rare neoplasms, especially within the central nervous system. Meningeal melanocytomas, a subtype of PMN, are even rarer. Nevus of Ota results from the incomplete migration of melanocytes from the neural crest Synchronous nevus of Ota and meningeal melanocytoma are infrequently encountered in clinical practice.
   OBJECTIVE: To evaluate and elucidate 12 cases of synchronous meningeal melanocytoma and nevus of Ota, thereby improving the understanding of the relationship between these 2 diseases.
   METHODS: We reviewed cases and searched the English-language literature from the PubMed database and collected clinical parameters of 12 cases of synchronously occurring nevus of Ota and meningeal melanocytoma.
   RESULTS: Among the 12 cases, 90.90% and 91.66% of the lesion were located ipsilaterally and supratentorially, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicated a trend for both types of lesion to be located ipsilaterally and supratentorially. When a patient with nevus of Ota is found to harbor an intracranial neoplasm, the most likely diagnosis is PMN.

AB BACKGROUND: The number of patients with a history of clipping of recurrent aneurysms after coil embolization has increased. The aim of this article was to report the feasibility of CT angiography using a commercial metal artifact reduction algorithm (Smart Metal Artifact Reduction [MAR]) for patients who underwent clipping of recurrent aneurysms after coil embolization.
   METHODS: Six cases of clipping of recurrent aneurysms after coil embolization were examined with CT angiography using MAR between 2015 and 2018 at a single institution. Conventional CT angiography and three-dimensional digital subtraction angiography data were compared, and depiction of the status of treated aneurysms using MAR was estimated.
   RESULTS: Conventional CT angiography was unable to depict the status of treated aneurysms in the patients with a history of clipping of recurrent aneurysms after coil embolization because of metal artifacts. With MAR, metal artifacts were greatly reduced, and the status of treated aneurysms was able to be depicted, although depiction was inferior to three-dimensional digital subtraction angiography.
   CONCLUSIONS: For patients with a history of clipping of recurrent aneurysms after coil embolization, CT angiography using MAR is feasible, although further development of imaging techniques is needed.

AB BACKGROUND: Consistent data on head injury is lacking especially in the low-and middle-income countries. Our study tries to characterize patients with head injury at the emergency department of one of the few tertiary public hospitals giving neurosurgical care in the country.
   METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional study was performed from May 2015 to October 2015 in one of the neurosurgical teaching hospitals, Black Lion Specialized Hospital. All adult patients with head injury who visited the emergency department during the study period were included. Data on patients' sociodemographic, mechanism of trauma, clinical presentation, imaging findings, and presence of polytrauma were collected by a pretested questionnaire. The source of data was emergency department logbooks and patient charts.
   RESULTS: A total of 390 patients with head injury who visited the emergency department were included during the study period. There were 335 males (85.9%) and 55 females (14.1%) with the mean age (standard deviation) of 35.4 (15.6) years. Majority of patients came by taxi constituting 149 (38.2%) of all patients, whereas 147 patients (37.7%) used ambulance. Of 147 patients brought by ambulances, 133 (90.4%) were referred from other hospitals. The majority, 26 (45.6%), of patientswho came directly to the emergency department used taxis. It is shown that the mode of arrival and origin of arrival are significantly related, P = 0.000. Mortality of severe head injury at the emergency department was 50.8%.
   CONCLUSIONS: Prehospital care coverage was low and ambulances were used mainly for interhospital transfers. Mortality of severe head injury at the emergency department is high and significantly associated with preventable causes like vital sign derangement.

AB BACKGROUND: Carotid artery stenting (CAS) is an established treatment for carotid artery stenosis, typically in a semielective or elective setting. The growth of mechanical thrombectomy for acute stroke has led to an increased use of emergent carotid artery stenting (eCAS). This single-center retrospective case series evaluates the safety and efficacy of eCAS using a dual-layer micromesh nitinol stent to treat carotid artery stenosis in the acute stroke setting.
   METHODS: Ethics approval was granted by the institutional review board. Clinical data of all patients who underwent CAS using the Casper dual-layer micromesh nitinol stent system (MicroVention, Terumo, Tustin, California, USA) at a tertiary level 24-hour endovascular thrombectomy service over a 2-year period (June 2016-June 2018) were retrospectively obtained and reviewed.
   RESULTS: Twenty eCAS procedures were performed in 19 patients over the study period. Most patients had tandem lesions (12/20; 60%). Median National Institute of Health Stroke Scale score on admission was 17 (interquartile range 9-22). Stent deployment was technically successful in all patients. Recanalization rate was 95%. Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage occurred in 2 patients (10%), both resulting in death. No other procedure-related deaths occurred. Stent thrombosis occurred in 2 patients. One delayed embolic stroke occurred. No other stent-related complications occurred. Median National Institute of Health Stroke Scale score at 24 hours postprocedure was 3 (interquartile range 1-12). Six patients had a good clinical outcome (modified Rankin Scale score between 0 and 2) at 3- to 6-month follow-up (38%).
   CONCLUSIONS: eCAS using the Casper stenting system is effective and technically feasible in the acute stroke setting, although the ideal antiplatelet and anticoagulation regime is not clearly established.

AB OBJECTIVE: Pedicle screw instrumentation is widely used for spinal deformity correction and fusion in adolescents for idiopathic scoliosis. The goal is to achieve and sustain good alignment in all 3 planes. We compared 2 different cobalt-chromium (CoCr) rod designs with different stiffnesses with regard to the restoration of coronal and sagittal balance in adolescents operated on for idiopathic scoliosis.
   MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective comparative study was made of 90 consecutive adolescents, mean age (standard deviation) 15.6 years (2.1 years), with idiopathic scoliosis who underwent posterior spinal fusion by the use of bilateral segmental pedicle screw instrumentation (PSI) with 6.0 Co-Cr rods. Fifty-four adolescents (43 girls) were operated on by the use of circular rods and 36 (27 girls) by the use of sagittal reinforced rods, with a 2-year follow-up.
   RESULTS: Preoperative major coronal curves were similar and at 2 years: 11 degrees (5.0) and 17 degrees (7.2) with correction percentages of 78% (10) and 69% (12) in the circular and reinforced rod groups (P < 0.01). Thoracic kyphosis at 2 years measured 16 degrees (7) and 21 degrees (6) in the circular and reinforced rod groups (P < 0.01). The number of patients with hypokyphosis was lower in the reinforced rod group at 2 years (P = 0.02). In the reinforced rod group, there was a negative correlation between coronal correction and thoracic kyphosis (r = - 0.52, P < 0.01).
   CONCLUSIONS: Both circular and sagittal reinforced 6.0-mm CoCr rods provide adequate coronal correction for adolescents with idiopathic scoliosis. The use of sagittal reinforced rods provided better thoracic kyphosis restoration and a lower risk for postoperative hypokyphosis.

TI Does Putting Back Hyperostotic Bone Flap in Meningioma Surgery Cause
   Tumor Recurrence? An Observational Prospective Study
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Cranioplasty; Hyperostosis; Meningioma; Recurrence; Simpson
ID SIMPSON GRADE; UNITED-STATES; PRIMARY BRAIN; RESECTION; SYSTEM
AB BACKGROUND: Replacing the skull defect with synthetic materials for hyperostotic bone secondary to meningioma is recommended owing to the possibility of tumor invasion. In our institution, neurosurgeons have been putting back the refashioned hyperostotic bone flap after meningioma excision because of budget constraints. The aim of this study was to review the long-term meningioma recurrence rate in these patients.
   METHODS: This was a nonrandomized, prospective observational study conducted from September 2011 to January 2015 on patients with intracranial convexity and parasagittal meningiomas. Preoperative computed tomography brain scans were obtained in all patients to confirm bony hyperostosis. Intraoperatively, part of the hyperostotic bone was sent for histopathologic examination. The rest of the bone flap was refashioned by drilling off the hyperostotic part. The bone flap was put back over the craniotomy site after soaking in distilled water. All patients were followed up for tumor recurrence.
   RESULTS: The study included 34 patients with convexity or parasagittal meningioma World Health Organization grade I-II who underwent Simpson grade Ia and IIa excision. Median follow-up was 63.5 months (mean 64.9 +/- 9.4 months). The hyperostotic hone flap showed presence of tumor in 35% of patients. There were 2 patients with parasagittal meningiomas after Simpson grade IIa resections who developed tumor recurrences.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our study found that meningioma recurrence was unlikely when autologous cranioplasty was done with refashioned hyperostotic bone. This could be done in the same setting with meningioma excision. There was no recurrence in convexity meningiomas at mean 5-year follow-up.

AB OBJECTIVE: To explore the feasibility and effectiveness of C1 lateral mass fixation via the posterior arch using pedicle screws of 3.5-mm diameter in patients whose atlas in the vertebral artery groove (C1 pedicle) was <= 3.5 mm in height.
   METHODS: A total of 14 patients who underwent trans-posterior arch lateral mass screw fixation between 2014 and 2017 due to atlantoaxial instability were retrospectively studied. The height of the atlas pedicle was <= 3.5 mm on one or both sides. The position of the screw and damage of the screw trajectory were assessed using the postoperative 3-dimensional computed tomography. The patients were regularly followed up to observe the fracture union and bone graft fusion.
   RESULTS: In total, 27 atlas pedicle heights were <= 3.5 mm and 22 screws were successfully inserted without any nenrovascular complications. However, the pedicle wall was found to have a certain degree of damage with damaged superior/inferior wall in 4 of 6 pedicles respectively. Clinical symptoms were relieved to varying degrees, and patients demonstrated bony fusion during the postoperative follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: Pedicle screws of 3.5-mm diameter could be fixed with a high success rate using the viscoelasticity and expansivity of the bone tissue even if the atlas pedicles were <= 3.5 mm in height. Although the screws had a certain probability of breaking the superior/inferior wall, they provided sufficient stability and enabled fracture or bone graft healing. Extraverted atlas pedicle screws should be considered in some cases.

AB OBJECTIVE: Until now, there were few studies on the analysis of oblique lumbar interbody fusion (OLIF) and extreme lateral interbody fusion (XLIF) in the initial stage of learning curve. The purpose of this study was to find out the safety differences between the 2 minimally invasive fusion methods in the initial stage of learning curve and to provide reference for beginners.
   METHODS: We retrospectively collected the first 30 cases of lumbar degenerative disease with OLIF or XLIF in our center since June 2014. Patients were divided into group OLIF and group XLIF according to different operative methods. The clinical efficacy and complications of the 2 groups were compared. A P <0.05 was statistically significant.
   RESULTS: Group XLIF were aged 37-74 years (mean 58.4 years) and group OLIF were aged 39-71 years (mean 56.1 years). There were no significant differences between the 2 groups in age, sex, operation time, intraoperative bleeding volume, operation segment, and follow-up time. The incidence of complications in group XLIF was significantly lower than that in group OLIF (10% vs. 33.3%; P = 0.028).
   CONCLUSIONS: OLIF has a higher risk of neurovascular in the initial stage of learning. By contrast, the XLIF approach is simple and the incidence of complications is relatively low. Therefore, we believed that XLIF is more acceptable in the initial stage of anterolateral lumbar interbody fusion.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate effects of holmium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Ho:YAG) laser ablation on postoperative low back pain and improving functional status in patients with lumbar disc herniation undergoing transforaminal endoscopic lumbar discectomy (TELD).
   METHODS: The study enrolled 220 patients with lumbar disc herniation who underwent TELD or TELD with Ho:YAG laser from August 2015 to September 2016. Parameters including operative time, hospitalization, complications, and recurrence were recorded. Clinical outcomes were assessed according to visual analog scale for back pain and leg pain, Oswestry Disability Index for functional status, and modified MacNab criteria for patient satisfaction.
   RESULTS: Minimal 2-year follow-up was completed by 186 patients: 76 patients who underwent TELD and 110 patients who underwent TELD with Ho:YAG laser. In the group undergoing TELD, clinical outcomes of back pain and functional status exhibited a V-shaped upward trend after surgery; there were no statistically significant differences in visual analog scale for back pain and Oswestry Disability Index scores at final follow-up compared with preoperatively (P > 0.05). In the group undergoing TELD with Ho:YAG laser, postoperative visual analog scale for hack pain and Oswestry Disability Index scores significantly improved compared with preoperatively (P < 0.05) exhibiting relatively consistent improvement after surgery. The only laser-related complication was a burning sensation in the ipsilateral lower limb during the thermal procedure in 2 cases.
   CONCLUSIONS: Performing Ho:YAG laser ablation with TELD prolonged low back pain relief and improved functional outcome during 2-year follow-up compared with TELD alone in patients with symptomatic lumbar disc herniation.

AB OBJECTIVE: The use of the Pipeline embolization device (PED) for posterior circulation aneurysms is controversial. The aim of this study was to explore the safety and efficacy of PED for these aneurysms in a meta-analysis. Meta-regression was used to identify predictors for incomplete aneurysm occlusion and procedure-related complications.
   METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, and OVID data-bases were searched to identify all published references evaluating the treatment effect of PED for posterior circulation aneurysms. Only studies written in English that reported original data and included >10 cases were considered for inclusion. Patient demographics, aneurysm characteristics, angiographic outcomes, and clinical outcomes were extracted. A random-effects model was adopted to pool the obliteration rates and complication rates across selected studies. Finally, we conducted meta-regression analysis to identify predictors of angiographic outcomes.
   RESULTS: 12 studies including 358 patients with 365 aneurysms were included. The pooled complete aneurysm obliteration rate was 82% (95% confidence interval 73%-90%), and pooled procedure-related complication rate was 18% (95% confidence interval 14%-22%). Increasing age predicted incomplete obliteration of aneurysms after PED treatment in these patients (P = 0.01).
   CONCLUSIONS: PED is an alternative to treat intracranial aneurysms of the posterior circulation, achieving high complete occlusion rates, but it is less effective in elderly patients. The risk of procedure-related complications is not negligible. Further larger, long-term follow-up studies are needed before definitive conclusions can be drawn.

DT Article
DE Arachnid; Dura mater; Jugular foramen; Skull base
ID MICROSURGICAL ANATOMY; VEIN
AB OBJECTIVE: This 3-dimensional histologic study aimed to provide a precise description of the meningeal structures in the jugular foramen.
   METHODS: 22 posterior skull base tissue blocks containing the jugular foramen region were obtained from 11 human cadaveric heads. These blocks were plastinated and cut into serial sections. After staining, these sections were examined under an optical microscope and used to reconstruct a 3-dimensional visualization model.
   RESULTS: At the intracranial orifice of the jugular foramen, the meningeal dura formed 2 separate dural perforations: the glossopharyngeal meatus and the vagal meatus. The arachnoid extended into 2 dural meatuses and terminated at the inferior ganglion of the glossopharyngeal nerve in the glossopharyngeal meatus and the superior ganglion of the vagus nerve in the vagal meatus. At the intraforaminal part of the jugular foramen, the meningeal dura encased the glossopharyngeal nerve to form a dural sheath while encasing the vagus and accessory nerves to form a dural network. At the extracranial orifice of the jugular foramen, the dural wall of the jugular bulb extended downward to form a dense connective tissue sheath. The initial end of the internal jugular vein invaginated into this sheath and fused with the jugular bulb.
   CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge of the anatomy of the meningeal architecture of the jugular foramen can be helpful in avoiding surgical complications of the lower cranial nerves when this complex area is approached.

AB OBJECTIVE: This study explored the differences between the immune microenvironments of primary and recurrent craniopharyngiomas (CPs). In addition, we investigated the relationship between the immune microenvironment and clinical characteristics of CP.
   METHODS: We collected 52 specimens from 26 patients with CPs. For each patient, specimens for both primary and recurrent CPs were obtained. We performed an immunohistochemical analysis of these specimens to determine the distributions of M2 macrophages, CD8+ T cells, programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1), and Ki67.
   RESULTS: In recurrent CP specimens, the distributions of M2 macrophages, Ki67, and PD-L1 increased compared with primary CP specimens (P = 0.019, P = 0.0084, and P = 0.0319, respectively). Moreover, the distributions of M2 macrophages, CD8+ Tcells, and PD-L1 in papillary CPswere higher than those observed in adamantinomatous craniopharyngiomas (ACPs) (P = 0.0317, P = 0.0359, and P < 0.0001, respectively). In the adult ACP group, M2 macrophages, CD8+ Tcells, and PD-L1weremore abundant/expressed than in the child ACP group (P = 0.0159, P = 0.0215, and P < 0.0088, respectively). A positive correlation was found between M2 macrophages and CD8+ T cells (r = 0.4079; P = 0.0027). Correspondingly, M2 macrophages and CD8+ T cells were both positively correlated with PD-L1 (r = 0.4564; P = 0.0007 and r = 0.3987; P = 0.0034, respectively). The observed high expression of M2 macrophages in primary CPs suggests a shortened time for tumor recurrence (P = 0.0131).
   CONCLUSIONS: The microenvironment of recurrent CP varies from that of primary CP. The abundance of M2 macrophages in primary CP may indicate a risk of early recurrence. Therefore, it is recommended to increase the frequency of follow-up examinations in these patients.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and clinical results of full endoscopic debridement and drainage (FEDD) for high-risk patients with spondylodiscitis.
   METHODS: Fourteen patients who underwent FEDD at our institution between November 2015 and September 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. All patients had single-level infectious spondylodiscitis and were high- risk candidates for surgery. Their general condition was evaluated according to the American Society of Anesthesiologists grading system. The Charlson Comorbidity Index was used for comprehensive assessment of comorbidity status. Outcomes were evaluated by numeric rating scale (NRS) pain score, Oswestry Disability Index, modified Macnab criteria, and radiographic images at follow-up.
   RESULTS: All 14 patients experienced immediate relief of back pain after FEDD, with no procedure-related complications. The causative bacteria were identified in 10 of the 14 patients (71.5%). Half of the 14 patients had an American Society of Anesthesiologists score of >= 3. The average Charlson Comorbidity Index was 5.1 +/- 1.6 points. Compared with the preoperative NRS score of 8.2 +/- 0.9, the NRS scores at 1 week and 12 months after surgery were 3.4 +/- 1.1 and 1.4 +/- 1.2, respectively. A significant improvement in Oswestry Disability Index was observed after surgery (preoperative, 30.1 +/- 3.9; 12 months postoperatively, 17.6 +/- 6.2; P < 0.05). Satisfaction rate was 85.7% based on the Macnab criteria (excellent or good outcome). None of the patients developed any significant kyphotic deformity after FEDD.
   CONCLUSIONS: FEDD may be an effective alternative to extensive open surgery in patients with infectious spondylodiscitis, especially those who are high-risk candidates for surgery (elderly patients with multiple comorbidities and patients in poor general condition).

AB BACKGROUND: We sought to determine whether systemic inflammatory markers (SIMs) can be used to predict the pathological grade of meningioma before surgery.
   METHODS: Patients with histopathologically proven intracranial meningiomas who had undergone surgery from January 2014 to April 2018 were identified. The 14 most recent SIM levels measured before surgery were retrieved. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to determine the statistically significant differences between groups. Receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed, and the areas under the curve (AUC) were calculated to assess the diagnostic value of each biomarker. Predictive models built with biomarker pairs using logistic regression or support vector machine classifiers were used to assess their combined performance.
   RESULTS: A total of 672 patients with 575 and 97 low-grade and high-grade meningiomas, respectively, were investigated. Of the 14 SIMS, 7 differed significantly between the 2 meningioma groups. However, receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that none of these 7 SIMs alone could predict for the meningioma grade; the highest AUC was 0.61. Two biomarkers (erythrocyte and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio) were incorporated into the logistic regression model; the corresponding AUC was 0.64. Moreover, 21 biomarker pairs were used to train the support vector machine classifiers; the AUCs of 6 pairs were >0.55; the maximum AUC was 0.60.
   CONCLUSIONS: SIMs obtained from routine preoperative laboratory testing had a limited ability to differentiate low- and high-grade meningioma in our cohort of 672 patients. Further prospective, multicenter studies with larger sample sizes are warranted to confirm this finding.

   OUTCOMES
AB OBJECTIVE: Very small intracranial aneurysms (VSIAs) are challenging to treat because aneurysm tearing and clip slippage can occur during neurosurgical clipping. In this study, we introduce and share our experience with cotton-assisted clipping of VSIAs.
   METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the data of 20 patients with 24 VSIAs treated with cotton-assisted clipping between February 2008 and December 2014 in the Neurosurgery Departments of the First Affiliated Hospital, Soochow University and Taizhou People's Hospital. During surgery, 2 aneurysm necks were torn. To treat the tears, we wrapped rectangular cotton pads around the parental arteries at the site of rupture. The remaining 22 aneurysms were clipped after being wrapped in cotton pads.
   RESULTS: The 2 aneurysm ruptures were successfully repaired with cotton-assisted clipping. In the remaining 22 aneurysms, no cases of aneurysm clip slippage or aneurysm rupture occurred. Patients were followed up on average for 59.0 months (range, 30-113 months). Of the 20 patients, the 16 patients with preoperative Hunt-Hess grades of 1-3 recovered well after the surgery (Glasgow Outcome Scale [GOS] score, 5). Of the 4 patients with Hunt-Hess grades of 4-5, 3 had a good recovery (GOS scores, 4-5), and 1 patient died of heart disease 6 months after being discharged from the hospital; this patient had a GOS score of 4 at the time of discharge.
   CONCLUSIONS: Cotton-assisted clipping could prevent aneurysm clip slipping and aneurysm rupture and facilitate the repair of aneurysm neck tears. This technique is a useful alternative therapy for VSIAs.

AB BACKGROUND: There is limited information on the impact of smoking on postcraniotomy mortality. In this study we used the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) to examine this issue.
   METHODS: We identified 16,280 postcraniotomy patients in the ACS-NSQIP database. Indications for surgery were categorized by vascular, trauma, epilepsy, malignant tumor, and benign tumor. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to identify risk factors associated with mortality.
   RESULTS: In the ACS-NSQIP dataset, postcraniotomy mortality within 30 days of surgery was 5.03%. An area under the curve analysis indicated 30 pack-years as the optimal discriminating threshold for risk stratification in terms of 30-day postcraniotomy mortality. Using this threshold, multivariate analyses revealed 3 variables that were closely associated with 30-day post-craniotomy mortality: male gender (P = 0.002), indication for operation (P< 0.001), and a smoking history of >= 30 pack-years (P < 0.001). In subsequent stratified analyses, smoking-associated mortality risk was observed only in males (odds ratio of 2.33 comparing males with <= 30 and <30 pack-years of smoking history; 97.5% confidence interval 1.36-4.03). When the analysis was further stratified by surgical indications, the mortality association with smoking was found only in male patients who underwent craniotomy as treatment for neurovascular diseases (odds ratio 3.88, 97.5% confidence interval 1.39-11.65). Such an association was not seen in patients who underwent craniotomy for traumatic brain injury, malignant tumors, benign tumors, or epilepsy.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study identified >= 30 pack-years as a risk factor for male patients undergoing craniotomy as treatment for neurovascular diseases.

AB OBJECTIVE: Fourth ventricular meningiomas (FVMs) are extremely rare. Here, we report a series of 11 patients at a single institution. A comprehensive literature analysis is conducted.
   METHODS: Information about 11 patient was extracted from the patient data. Reports of cases in English were obtained from the literature. Including our 11 patients, 71 patients were analyzed in this study.
   RESULTS: The most common age of onset was from the third decade to sixth decade of life. The female/male ratio was about 1.16:1. The most frequent subtype of meningioma was fibrous meningioma. FVMs had specific imaging features, such as calcification (20%), peritumoral edema (30.3%), heterogeneous enhancement (22.5%), cystic formation (4.3%), and hydrocephalus (52.8%). The proportion of total tumor resection was about 94.9%, with 15.3% of postoperative complications. During follow-up, the recurrent rate of FVMs was about 6.8%. There was no significant difference in the analysis of correlation between hydrocephalus and the maximum diameter of tumors, correlation between hydrocephalus and the volume of tumor, or correlation between peritumoral edema and the volume of tumor, as well as correlation between heterogeneous enhancement and the grade of meningiomas.
   CONCLUSIONS: FVMs have their own characteristics in age of onset, gender ratio, histologic types, and imaging features. The recommended treatment is surgical treatment via the telovelar approach with suboccipital craniotomy/craniectomy. Adjuvant therapy is needed in some high-grade meningiomas and in patients undergoing partial resection. The prognosis is relatively good, with fewer postoperative complications and a higher rate of total resection.

AB OBJECTIVE: We retrospectively assessed the surgical outcomes of transitional meningioma (TM) in a relatively large series to evaluate the long-term outcomes and propose an appropriate treatment strategy for TM.
   METHODS: We included 298 patients who had undergone surgery from September 2011 to August 2013. The clinical characteristics, surgical record, and follow-up data for these patients were retrieved.
   RESULTS: The 298 enrolled patients included 213 women (71.5%). The mean and median age of the 298 patients was 50.7 +/- 0.6 years and 52.0 years (range, 6.0-74.0), respectively. Radiologically, 144 tumors (48.3%) were located in the skull base. Gross total resection (GTR) was achieved in 266 patients (89.3%); 7 patients (2.6%) received adjuvant radiotherapy. After a median follow-up of 61.8 months, 23 patients (8.6%) had developed recurrence and 2 patients (0.8%) had died. The results from univariate analysis indicated that GTR was associated with better progression-free survival (hazard ratio, 0.165; 95% confidence interval, 0.071-0.382; P < 0.001)1 Skull base tumors tended to predict for poor progression-free survival (hazard ratio, 2.169; 95% confidence interval, 0.919-5.118; P = 0.077). For the first tumor recurrence, 11 patients (47.8%) underwent gamma knife radiosurgery, and only 2 patients developed a second recurrence.
   CONCLUSION: The results from the present study have shown that GTR should be achieved during the first surgery for TM. Gamma knife radiosurgery might be an effective therapy for patients with tumor recurrence.

AB OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the reliability of clinical features, noninvasive transcranial Doppler-related pulsatility index (PI) calculation, and optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) measured by ultrasound (US) and initial computed tomography (CT) scan (Marshall CT scan classification) in predicting the occurrence of early (<24 hours) high intracranial pressure (EHICP) (>20 mm Hg) after severe traumatic brain injury (TBI).
   METHODS: We conducted an observational prospective study in a level 1 trauma center. Patients were measured simultaneously for PI and US ONSD in the triage zone. Patients were categorized into 2 groups: those who had EHICP after TBI (EHICP+) and those who did not (EHICP-).
   RESULTS: Fifty-four patients were included; 32 were categorized as EHICP+ and 22 as EHICP-. PI >1.4 did not correlate with EHICP+ patients (69% vs. 46%, P = 0.09). US ONSD measurement was higher in the EHICP+ group (6.25; range, 6-6.95 vs. 5.7; range, 5.2-6.4; P = 0.005). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for US ONSD as a predictor of developing EHICP was 0.73 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.59-0.86). CT ONSD measurement was higher in the EHICP+ group (6.71; range, 6.35-7.87 vs. 6.25; range, 5.8-6.93; P = 0.04). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for CT ONSD measurement as a predictor for EHICP+ was 0.67 (95% CI, 0.53-0.81). The diffuse injury III and IV categories in the Marshall CT scan classification were associated with the occurrence of EHICP (P = 0.004).
   CONCLUSIONS: None of the clinical features or noninvasive tools assessed in this study enabled clinicians to strictly ascertain EHICP. Further studies are needed to establish their potential role before intracranial pressure probe insertion.

AB BACKGROUND: w to precise mechanism of aneurysm wall enhancement (AWE) in ruptured intracranial anewrysms on magnetic resonance vessel wall imaging (VWI) remains unclear. We explored patterns of VWI findings and correlations with intraoperative or histopathologic aneurysm wall architecture.
   METHODS: Twenty-four patients were evaluated by VWI before microsurgical clipping or endovascular coiling. The patterns of AWE were categorized, and the contrast ratio of AWE area was measured relative to the pituitary stalk. A total of 13 aneurysms were microsurgically inspected of the aneurysm wall and 4 were available for histopathologic evaluation.
   RESULTS: AWE was identified in 20 of 24 ruptured aneurysms. Among these 20 aneurysms, AWE was focal in 15 and circumferential in 5. Focal AWE showed significantly higher contrast ratio than circumferential AWE (P = 0.002). Histopathologic studies suggested that focal AWE indicating contrast ratio over 0.1 could be associated with fresh intraluminal thrombus at the rupture site. On the contrary, circumferential AWE suggested potential wall thickening with abundant neovascularization and inflammatory cells.
   CONCLUSIONS: Two AWE patterns were seen in ruptured intracranial aneurysms. Focal AWE on magnetic resonance imaging might indicate the presence of intraluminal thrombus, and detection of this sign could be useful for identification of the rupture point before treatment.

AB OBJECTIVE: Moyamoya disease (MMD) is characterized by a progressive spontaneous occlusion of distal internal carotid arteries and its main branches. It is necessary to promptly diagnose and treat this condition, especially in children, because of the high risk of stroke and consequent severe disability. In this study, we examine the role of multiple burr-hole surgery (MBHS) in the treatment of pediatric patients with MMD and quasi-MMD and the role of perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the surgical indication and during follow-up.
   METHODS: We reviewed preoperative, early postoperative, and late postoperative MRI perfusion and digital subtraction angiography images together with clinical and surgical outcomes in 10 children with MMD treated by MBHS.
   RESULTS: Fourteen MBHS procedures (6 unilateral, 2 bilateral, and 2 single-setting bilateral) were performed in 10 children. Clinical and radiologic follow-up for all patients ranges from 16 months to 7 years. No ischemic events (transient ischemic attacks or stroke) occurred during the follow-up period. Postoperative digital subtraction angiography showed good revascularization around the burr-hole sites in all patients. The functional efficacy of the surgery was confirmed by dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion MRI studies in 8 patients.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our data underline the good rate of success of MBHS in pediatric MMD and quasi-MMD. This technique results in good collateral revascularization, improved cerebral perfusion and excellent short and long-term symptoms control, with low perioperative risk. Postoperative changes of perfusion parameters and ivy sign MRI finding seem to show a positive correlation and mainly occur in posterior middle cerebral artery territory.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Neovascularization (NV) is regarded to be one of the important features of vulnerable plaque. The purpose of this study was to evaluate associations between the presence of NV, detected using optical frequency domain imaging (OFDI), and ischemic events and the progress of carotid artery stenosis.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Carotid artery plaques were evaluated using an OFDI system before angioplasty. NV was defined as no-signal tubuloluminal structures recognized on at least 3 consecutive images. The total number of NVs was compared between symptomatic and asymptomatic plaques and between progressive and nonprogressive plaques. Carotid plaque was diagnosed as "progressive" when peak systolic velocity increased between serial carotid duplex scans.
   RESULTS: A total of 36 patients (17 symptomatic, 16 progressive) were included. The percentage of patients with smoking habits was significantly higher with progressive carotid plaque than with nonprogressive carotid plaque (P = 0.003). NV was detected in 34 patients (94%), and the total number of NVs was significantly higher with progressive carotid plaque (10.2 +/- 4.8 vs. 3.7 +/- 2.8; P < 0.0001). There was no relationship between the number of NVs and ischemic events (symptomatic 6.0 +/- 5.1 vs. asymptomatic 7.1 +/- 5.0; P = 0.47). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, the number of NVs was an independent predictor of progressive carotid plaque (odds ratio 1.64 per 1 increase [95% confidence interval 1.19-2.64]; P = 0.0005).
   CONCLUSIONS: NV was more frequently observed in progressive carotid plaques. Evaluation of NV using OFDI may be useful in predicting progressive carotid plaques.

AB BACKGROUND: Robotic technology is rapidly developing in the medical field, particularly contributing to support operative intervention using the da Vinci system during endoscopic surgery. Neuroendovascular intervention robot surgery is preferred when aiming to reduce radiation exposure among surgeons.
   METHODS: We developed a prototype of a support robot with 2 independent slaves manipulating both the microcatheter and microguidewire connected with the remote master driver with 2 joysticks. This design simulates usual catheterization with both hands. The slave manipulator has a sufficient output force >1 N to reproduce the exact master intervention without slip and delay. This machine has a unique function that indicates the reaction force of the resistance on wire stuck using the sensor system. We investigated the master-slave response, reliability of the force gauge, and degree of slippage of the slave motion on the table and checked the controllability, safety, and reproducibility of microcatheterization and insertion maneuver into the experimental aneurysm in the in vivo silicone vessel model.
   RESULTS: We realized the well master-slave response with a stable driving speed of the microguidewire at approximately 1 mm/s and with linear correlation between the output voltage and driving force. Also, we confirmed the well safety function to avoid the overloading to the vascular wall with the slippage of the slave roller on loading >1 N pushing force. Successful microcatheterization and insertion into the aneurysm model was performed in the wet vascular model corresponding to the 3-dimensional handling without excessive stress to the vascular or aneurysmal wall.
   CONCLUSIONS: Neuroendovascular intervention requires delicate power adjustment with fine finger control. Our support robot for neuroendovascular interventions demonstrated the accurate reproducibility of the operator's maneuver and safe operation in the vascular model using the sensor system. This system will realize the neurointervention without human operators in the AngioSuite and may facilitate telesurgery with remote control in the near future.

AB BACKGROUND: In the management of meningiomas invading the major venous sinuses, balance between tumor control and complication prevention is desirable. The aim of this study was to describe an institutional experience in management of meningiomas involving major venous sinuses.
   METHODS: A retrospective study was carried out over 18 years, between 1999 and 2017, in patients with meningiomas involving major venous sinuses. Clinical features, operative strategy, histology, postoperative complications, adjuvant therapy, and long-term follow-up were studied.
   RESULTS: The study included 84 patients. Neurologic deficits were seen in 26 (31%) patients at presentation. The recurrence rates in Simpson grade I, II, and III excision were 7.6%, 25%, and 29.4% at a mean follow-up of 45.4 months (range, 1-192 months). No intervention of the involved sinus was done in 64 (76%) cases, venotomy was done in 3 (3.5%) cases, sinus resection without graft was done in 14 (16.6%) cases, and sinus reconstruction with patch was done in 3 (3.5%) cases. There were 53 (67.0%) patients with World Health Organization grade I histology and 25 (31.6%) patients with World Health Organization grade II histology. Fifteen recurrences were treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery. In univariate analysis using Cox proportional hazards model, World Health Organization grade (P = 0.036, hazard ratio 2.90, 95% confidence interval = 1.07-7.87) and Simpson grade (P = 0.017, hazard ratio 2.90, 95% confidence interval [1.18-5.29) were found to be significant factors to predict tumor recurrence.
   CONCLUSIONS: Management of meningiomas involving major venous sinus with microsurgical techniques and adjuvant Gamma Knife radiosurgery achieves a good tumor control rate with an acceptable complication rate.

AB BACKGROUND: Prior retrospective and prospective studies suggest improved survival with the use of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and bevacizumab in the treatment of limited-volume glioblastoma (GBM) recurrences.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed our experience with gamma knife SRS in combination with bevacizumab for the treatment of focal GBM recurrence during 2009-2015. Outcomes include overall survival, progression free survival (PFS), and radiation-related adverse events. Kaplan-Meier methods and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were performed for survival analysis.
   RESULTS: Within a median of 13.7 months after diagnosis, a total of 45 patients with GBM underwent gamma knife SRS and bevacizumab treatment. Median age was 57 years (range: 20-78 years) and 63.3% were women. The median Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS) at recurrence was 80 (range: 40-100). Sixty-four percent of patients had single radiosurgery target (range: 1-4) and median target volume and margin dose were 2.2 cm(3) (range: 0.1-25.2 cm(3)) and 17.0 gray (Gy) (range: 13-24 Gy), respectively. Median PFS and overall survival were 9.3, 31.0 months following diagnosis, and 5.2, 13.3 months after SRS, respectively. Factors associated with poor outcomes were KPS <= 70, SRS dose <18 Gy, and use of <2 chemotherapy agents prior to SRS. No radiation-related adverse events occurred.
   CONCLUSIONS: SRS in combination with bevacizumab can be safely used to treat focal GBM recurrence. KPS, radiation dose, and multi-agent chemotherapy usage prior to SRS demonstrated significant impact on PFS. Bevacizumah may provide clinically relevant radioprotection.

AB BACKGROUND: Flow diverter stents are often used in the treatment of giant aneurysms at carotid arteries. Although these stents promise to decrease blood flow into the aneurysm sac, little is known about hemodynamics inside the aneurysm once the stent is planted into the aneurysm neck. To further explore this, computational fluid dynamics and Lagrangian coherent structure (LCS) techniques were used to evaluate the time evolution mechanism of stagnation regions inside an aneurysm. The purpose of this work is to provide a quantitative effectiveness comparison of 2 different flow diverter stents placed into the aneurysm neck based on their stagnation zone formations in the sac.
   METHODS: In numerical modeling, Womersley function, and fluidsolid interaction were defined as the 3 cardiac cycles for blood velocity and the aneurysm wall, respectively. Moreover, blood was accepted as a non-Newtonian fluid, and mean arterial blood pressure of the patient was entered into the computational domain to accurately mimic the hemodynamics inside the aneurysm sac accurately.
   RESULTS: The numerical analyses revealed that the use of a Fred-type stent in the aneurysm neck causes fluid flow zone formations yielding to sequenced stagnated regions. Time evolution of stagnation regions in an aneurysm sac was shown just after a flow diverter stent was employed at a patient's aneurysm neck. Furthermore, the stagnation field in the Fred stent-fitted aneurysm was nearly 4.8 times the stagnation area of the Surpass brand stent-attached aneurysm.
   CONCLUSIONS: Finite time Lyapunov exponent fields obtained from the LCS techniques demonstrated a good agreement with the patient's digital subtraction angiography images obtained just after treatment.

AB BACKGROUND: 5-Aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) induces the accumulation of a large amount of protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) in tumors, which has been used in the treatment of several cancers. 5-ALA is commonly used for fluorescence-guided tumor resection in clinical neurosurgery and for photodynamic therapy based on the generation of cytotoxic oxygen.
   OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to identify the mechanisms of 5-ALA-induced immune response in macrophages in malignant glioma.
   METHODS: Intracellular levels of 5-ALA-induced PpIX in C3H/HeN murine peritoneal macrophages were measured by the median fluorescence intensity using flow cytometry and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Macrophages were cultured in vitro with or without 0.5 mM 5-ALA, 0.1 tg/mL lipopolysaccharide, and 20% glioma-conditioned medium. Levels of immunosuppressive prostaglandin E-2 (PGE(2)), interleukin-10, and transforming growth factor beta were measured using enzyme immunoassay in the culture supernatant. In addition, macrophages and RSV-M mouse glioma cells were co-cultured in vitro with cell culture inserts with or without 5-ALA (0.1 and 0.5 mM) and lipopolysaccharide (0.1 mu g/mL).
   RESULTS: We found that 5-ALA-induced PpIX accumulated in macrophages and significantly suppressed PGE(2) production and expression of both cyclooxygenase-2 and microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1. 5-ALA treatment also suppressed PGE(2) production by glioma-conditioned medium. 5-ALA suppressed RSV-M glioma cell proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner.
   CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that 5-ALA suppressed PGE(2) production by macrophages via the down-regulation of cyclooxygenase-2 and microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 expression levels. This is a novel mechanism to induce effective immune response against glioma in macrophages.

ID CEREBELLAR HEMORRHAGE; MANAGEMENT; MORTALITY
AB BACKGROUND: Posterior fossa hemorrhage (PFH) of the cerebellum is managed by decompressive craniectomy when there is clinical deterioration. There is no current consensus on an objective imaging method to determine which patients need surgery before clinical deterioration. We developed an imaging scoring tool by assessing initial hemorrhage diameter and posterior fossa (PF) measurements to determine which patients will benefit from early surgical intervention.
   METHODS: For this case-control study, we reviewed the electronic medical record to identify adults who presented with PFH over a 10-year period at our institution. Chart review for clinical findings and inciting factors were documented. The average diameter of PFH and the surrogate PF volume on initial imaging studies were measured. These measurements were correlated with surgical intervention. A scoring tool was developed based on radiographic and clinical data.
   RESULTS: Fifty-one patients met the inclusion criteria. The average hemorrhage diameter and the surrogate PF volume measurements were statistically different between surgical and nonsurgical cases (P < 0.001 and P = 0.019, respectively). The scoring system was created by dividing average hemorrhage diameter by surrogate PF volume and multiplying by 1000. The median score of nonsurgical patients was 9.1, and the median score of surgical patients was 15.6.
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients presenting with PFH with smaller PF volumes may be more likely to require surgery as determined by clinical standards. The proposed scoring system based on simple measurements on initial computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging may help surgeons consider early surgical intervention in those patients with PFH with smaller PF volumes.

TI Minimally Invasive Aneurysm Clipping: The Extent of the Supraorbital
   Approach
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Aneurysm; Clipping; Supraorbital approach
AB BACKGROUND: The supraorbital keyhole craniotomy is a well-established minimally invasive approach for the treatment of intracranial aneurysms. However, the surgical range of exposure using this technique for treatment of intracranial aneurysms has not been studied.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the data of all clipped aneurysm cases using the supraorbital approach (SO) between 2006 and 2016 in our center. Most importantly, we determined the location of the treated aneurysms in the axial 2-dimensional plane, with the anterior clinoid process (ACP) as the point of reference: the ACP to aneurysm distance. Finally, we extracted data on patient age, aneurysm size, size of the craniotomy, length of hospital stay, and surgery-related complications.
   RESULTS: We included 142 patients for this series. A total of 170 aneurysms were clipped by means of the SO, and in 18 cases multiple aneurysms were treated during the same surgery. The mean aneurysm size was 7 mm (3.5-22 mm) and the mean craniotomy size was 28 mm (19-41 mm). The aneurysm location ranged from 14.4 mm medially to 35 mm laterally, measured with the ipsilateral ACP as the zero reference.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although the SO is conventionally used in the treatment of anterior circulation aneurysms, we were able to treat aneurysms over a range of 50 mm over the skull base. With its low complication risk, relatively short hospital stay, and excellent cosmetic results, SO remains a valuable treatment option for both young and aged patients.

AB BACKGROUND: Moyamoya syndrome (MMS), distinguished from definite moyamoya disease (MMD), is characterized by moyamoya vasculopathy thought to develop secondary to underlying conditions (e.g., hyperthyroidism). Recent studies have shown that a proportion of East Asian (EAS) patients with MMS possess the p.R4810K variant of RNF213 (rs112735431), the foremost susceptibility variant among EAS patients with MMD. We evaluated the association between hyperthyroidism-associated MMS (hMMS) and sequence variants in RNF213.
   METHODS: We performed next-generation sequencing of RNF213 in 15 patients with hMMS. Candidate coding variants for the association analysis were defined by allelic frequencies of <1%, based on the p.R4810K frequency in the Japanese population. The association with hMMS was tested using a collapsing method, and 260 unrelated EAS women from the 1000 Genomes Project served as population-based controls.
   RESULTS: All patients were female, reflecting female predominance in both moyamoya and hyperthyroid conditions. Five candidate missense variants in RNF213 were identified in 8 of 15 patients (53.3%): p.C118R, p.R4062Q, and p.R4810K as heterozygous; and p.A3468V and p.S3986N as compound heterozygous with p.R4810K. Among 260 EAS female controls, 36 (13.8%) had putatively functional variants. All identified variants were missense variants and were significantly overrepresented among patients compared with EAS controls (permuted P = 0.00010; odds ratio = 7.03; 95% confidence interval, 2.09-24.3).
   CONCLUSIONS: Rare and low-frequency missense variants in RNF213 confer susceptibility to both MMD and hMMS. This finding indicates that susceptibility variants in RNF213 may require additional clinical factors with an effect equivalent to hyperthyroidism in order to develop moyamoya vasculopathy.

ID NERVOUS-SYSTEM LYMPHOMA; MR SPECTROSCOPY; GLIOBLASTOMA-MULTIFORME;

AB BACKGROUND: Although the treatment strategies for malignant lymphomas and gliomas differ, it is usually difficult to preoperatively distinguish between them. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was recently reported to be useful for preoperative diagnoses; however, MRS data analysis using LCModel, which is a quantitative and objective method, was performed in only a few of the existing reports.
   METHODS: The clinical characteristics, conventional magnetic resonance imaging findings, and MRS parameters using LCModel were evaluated to identify the factors that can help distinguish between malignant lymphomas and enhanced gliomas.
   RESULTS: In total, 59 cases were evaluated, including 13 cases of malignant lymphoma, 1 case of pilocytic astrocytoma, 5 cases of grade II glioma, 5 cases of grade III glioma, and 35 cases of glioblastoma. There was no correlation between clinical characteristics (sex and age) and diagnosis. Neither T1- nor T2-weighted image was useful for differentiation between the 2 forms of tumors, but the apparent diffusion coefficient minimum value was useful for distinguishing malignant lymphomas from gliomas, with an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.852. MRS analysis using LCModel revealed differences in glutamate (Glu), N-acetylaspartate (NAA) + N-acetylaspartylglutamate NAAG), Glu + glutamine, and Lipid (Lip) 13a + Lip13b between malignant lymphomas and gliomas. The largest AUC was 0.904, which was obtained for the Glu level, followed by 0.883 and 0.866 for NAA + NAAG and Lip13a + Lip13b, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative analysis of proton-MRS using LCModel is considered to be a valuable method for distinguishing between gliomas and malignant lymphomas.

AB BACKGROUND: Diagnosis of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus is based in clinical data, radiologic variables, and invasive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing, such as the lumbar infusion test. Several neuroimaging findings are inconclusively related to improvement after CSF shunt surgery. CSF tests are invasive and have complications. The aim of this study was to select radiologic variables related to a positive lumbar infusion test so as to avoid this test in patients.
   METHODS: Patients with possible idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus were reviewed. The collected radiologic data were cingulate sulcus sign, disproportionately enlarged subarachnoid space, callosal angle, and width of temporal horns. Two groups were established: group 1, comprising patients with resistance to CSF outflow <12 mm Hg/ml/minute, and group 2, comprising patients with resistance to CSF outflow >12 mm Hg/ml/minute. Negative and positive predictive values were determined.
   RESULTS: The study included 43 patients in group 1 and 64 patients in group 2. Group 2 significantly showed more acute callosal angle with higher accuracy cutoff value of 90.6 degrees, lower width of temporal horns with higher accuracy cutoff value of 8 mm, and higher percentage of cingulate sulcus sign and disproportionately enlarged subarachnoid space. Matching the radiologic variables, positive predictive values were >80%; however, negative predictive values were low.
   CONCLUSIONS: Owing to high positive predictive values of matched radiological variables, the lumbar infusion test could be avoided in the diagnosis of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus. However, when 1 or 2 of the variables are negative, this invasive test should be performed.

AB OBJECTIVE: Although mannitol is used widely to facilitate brain retraction in cases of ruptured aneurysms, there is no consensus about the intraoperative administration of mannitol in the case of unruptured aneurysms. Accordingly, this study was conducted to identify an intraoperative mannitol administration strategy.
   METHODS: Mannitol was administered routinely to patients (n = 90) from January 2015 to April 2016 and not administered to patients (n = 97) from May 2016 to June 2017. The patient groups with and without mannitol administration were then compared based on the patient medical records, radiologic data, and digital recordings from an intraoperative microscope.
   RESULTS: The patient groups with and without mannitol administration were comparable regarding patient age, number of elderly patients, sex, and aneurysm locations. No between-group difference was identified in terms of the intradural procedural time, retraction-induced cortical injury, postoperative electrolyte imbalance, symptomatic infarction, and postoperative epidural hematomas. However, the patient group without mannitol administration showed a significantly lower incidence of chronic subdural hematomas (CSDHs) >50 ml (13.3% vs. 3.1%, P = 0.010). Moreover, a multivariate analysis revealed that an advanced age (P = 0.019), male sex (P <0.001), and mannitol administration (P = 0.040) were all statistically significant risk factors for a postoperative CSDH >50 mL following unruptured aneurysm surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: Withholding the administration of mannitol during a pterional or modified procedure for unruptured aneurysms was found to reduce the postoperative occurrence of a CSDH without increasing the operative difficulties or other postoperative complications.

AB BACKGROUND: Evidence continues to emerge regarding the inverse relationship between high neurointerventional case volume and complication rates, leading several medical/surgical societies to recommend minimum volumes for specific procedures. Recent data suggest few centers are meeting these requirements. We report a single center's neurointerventional complication rates with associated case volumes, along with a review of the literature.
   METHODS: A retrospective cohort review of all consecutive patients undergoing diagnostic catheter cerebral angiography and/or neurointerventional procedures between January 1, 2013, and March 1, 2018, was undertaken. No diagnostic or interventional procedures were excluded. All major and minor complications were recorded.
   RESULTS: A total of 1000 procedures (463 diagnostic cerebral angiograms and 537 neurointerventional procedures) were completed. Of the neurointerventional procedures, 216 (40%) were endovascular thrombectomy, 170 (32%) were aneurysmal embolization, and 48 (9%) were carotid stenting. The mean and median age was 60 years. There were 460 women and 540 men. The total number of major complications for diagnostic angiography, endovascular thrombectomy, ruptured aneurysm embolization, unruptured aneurysm embolization, and carotid artery stenting were 4 (0.9%), 4 (1.9%), 10 (11%), 4 (5.4%), and 3 (6.3%), respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: We provided a single-center experience of the relationship between neurointerventional procedural case volume and complication rates in the growth phase of our center's establishment. We demonstrated that as our center was being developed, specific procedural staffing measures allowed proficiency maintenance, acquisition of new techniques, and complication avoidance, whereas specific case volumes crossed the suggested thresholds as defined in the literature.

AB BACKGROUND: Postoperative C5 palsy affects 8% of patients undergoing posterior cervical decompression. It is associated with a period functional disability that may exceed 12 months and increase direct care costs > $2000.
   METHODS: All patients undergoing posterior cervical decompression at a single tertiary-care facility for degenerative conditions were evaluated for preoperative imaging, clinical presentation, surgical operation, and postoperative course. We sought to identify those variables predictive of postoperative C5 palsy.
   RESULTS: Of 221 included patients (mean age, 63 years; 54% male), 12.2% experienced C5 palsy. On univariate analysis, C5 palsy was associated with foraminal diameter (P = 0.0005), spinal cord cross-sectional area (P = 0.11), number of levels undergoing laminectomy (P = 0.14), and clinical presentation of dropping objects (P = 0.07), hand clumsiness (P = 0.13), or paresthesias in the upper extremities (P = 0.08). Foramina! diameter (odds ratio, 0.31 per mm increase; 95% confidence interval, 0.16-0.60; P < 0.001) and patient report of gait disturbance (odds ratio, 0.53; 95% confidence interval, 0.33-0.85; P = 0.008) were the only significant predictors on multivariate analysis. A foraminal diameter <2 mm had 2-fold greater odds of postoperative C5 palsy. A receiver operating curve for the multivariate logistic model had an associated C-statistic of 0.7818. The absolute error of this model was 9.3% on internal validation.
   CONCLUSIONS: Foraminal stenosis most strongly predicted postoperative C5 palsy. A proof-of-concept model incorporating foramen size, as well as clinical complaints of paresthesias, hand clumsiness, and gait abnormality, successfully predicts the occurrence of postoperative palsy with an overall accuracy of 78%.

   OUTCOMES
AB BACKGROUND: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak is a frustrating complication of skull base surgery. Published methodologies using national surgical databases to assess CSF leak have not accounted for variability between skull base operations.
   OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to attempt the development of a novel framework for adapting big data techniques to skull base surgery and assess the reliability of corresponding data manipulations.
   METHODS: A retrospective nested case-control analysis was performed using patients from the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) registry, 2012-2015. Current Procedural Terminology and International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes identified possible skull base operations, which were systematically grouped by anatomic location. Meningioma, schwannoma, pituitary adenoma, and trigeminal neuralgia (TN) were included.
   RESULTS: Of 2918 patients, 84 (2.9%) were readmitted/ reoperated on within 30 days for CSF leak. Operations involving the anterior fosse, both middle/posterior fosses in 1 approach, or the orbitocranial zygomatic approach were significantly associated with CSF leak, as were schwan-nomas and meningiomas in any location (8.5%, 3.1%, 10.2%, 4.1%, and 3.0%; all P< 0.0001). Multivariate analysis of only middle/posterior fossa lesions identified schwannoma (odds ratio [OR], 2.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-5.6; P = 0.008), TN (OR, 5.4; 95% CI, 2-14.7; P = 0.008), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR, 3.9; 95% CI, 1.1-14; P = 0.03), and increased operative time (OR, 4.0; 95% CI, 1.7-9.5; P = 0.009) as significant CSF leak risk factors.
   CONCLUSIONS: Based on NSQIP data analyzed using a rational skull base/anatomic framework, risk factors for postoperative CSF leak include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, operative time, anterior fossa meningioma, and middle/posterior fosse schwannoma or TN. Although databases such as NSQIP can be extensively manipulated to generate surrogate results that may provide limited insight, applications beyond their design should be approached carefully.

ID RADIATION-THERAPY; PRESERVATION; SURGERY; MANAGEMENT; RADIOTHERAPY
AB OBJECTIVE: Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) is an established treatment modality for vestibular schwannomas (VSs). The tumor control and hearing preservation rates suggest that GKRS is a good alternative treatment for small-and medium-size VS. Data are lacking from India regarding GKRS for VSs. Our aim was to find the hearing preservation and tumor control rates and the factors contributing to these.
   METHODS: In a retrospective 9-year study period, 87 patients had undergone GKRS for unilateral VS with Gardner-Robertson (GR) class I or II serviceable hearing. All 87 had been evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging and audiometry before GKRS and during follow-up to assess for the factors influencing tumor control and hearing preservation.
   RESULTS: Of the 87 patients, 77 with a minimum followup of 2 years and magnetic resonance imaging and audiometry evaluations available were included in the present study. The median follow-up period was 30 months. The tumor control rate and hearing preservation rate was 96.1% and 79.2%, respectively. Hearing preservation was not affected by the tumor volume. However, age > 40 years, pre-GKRS pure tone average < 30 decibels, speech discrimination score > 85%, pre-GKRS Gardner-Robertson grade I hearing, mean cochlear dose < 4 Gy, and pre-GKRS Ohata class of laterality C, D, E were significant on univariate analysis. The multivariate analysis revealed that age > 40 years (P = 0.017), pre-GKRS pure tone average < 30 decibels (P = 0.002), and Gardner-Robertson class I (P = 0.001) were significant factors. No patient developed cranial nerve dysfunction, hydrocephalus, or malignant degeneration.
   CONCLUSION: For most patients with small VSs, GKRS will be an effective alternative treatment to microsurgery with retained serviceable hearing and good tumor control.

AB BACKGOUND: Asymmetric cortical vessel sign (ACVS) on susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) indicates elevated concentration of deoxyhemoglobin and elevated oxygen extraction fraction in patients with cerebral ischemia. This study aimed to clarify whether ACVS is associated with impaired hemodynamics and hyperperfusion syndrome in patients with moyamoya disease (MMD).
   METHODS: Consecutive adult patients with MMD were enrolled. ACVS data on SWI and perfusion data using dynamic perfusion computed tomography were obtained and evaluated preoperatively and on postoperative days 2 and 180.
   RESULTS: A total of 24 patients with MMD were enrolled. Of 11 (45.83%) patients showing positive ACVS before surgery, 8 turned negative on postoperative day 2 and 9 showed absence of ACVS 180 days after surgery. Regions of interest showing positive ACVS had lower cerebral blood flow (CBF, P< 0.001), increased cerebral blood volume (P = 0.021), prolonged time to peak (P< 0.001), and mean transit time (P = 0.009). No patients with hemorrhagic symptoms showed positive ACVS(P = 0.041) and patients with positive ACVS showed more increase in CBF (P< 0.004).
   CONCLUSIONS: In patients with MMD, ACVS on SWI indicates severe impairment in hemodynamics and is associated with more increase in CBF after bypass surgery. Hence, ACVS on SWI might be considered as a neuroimaging marker for the evaluation of hemodynamics in patients with MMD.

AB OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated radiation exposure and operation time of percutaneous endoscopic lumbar discectomy (PELD) by using a fluoroscopy-based navigation system for access and localization.
   METHODS: Eighty-six PELDs performed by a single surgeon were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were separated into 2 groups: group A (using a three-dimensional [3D]-printed navigation instrument and fluoroscopy-based navigation system) and group B (with conventional fluoroscopy and standard instrumentation). The operation, fluoroscopy, and total access time were collected, as well as fluoroscopy and access times.
   RESULTS: The operative time for group A was 59 minutes (standard deviation [SD], 6 minutes) and 106 minutes (SD, 15 minutes) in group B (P < 0.001). In group A, fluoroscopy was used an average of 5 times (SD, 0.7) and 29 times (SD, 8) in group B (P < 0.001). The fluoroscopy time was 9 minutes (SD, 2 minutes) in group A and 40 minutes (SD, 8 minutes) in group B (P < 0.001). The number of access attempts was 1.3 (SD, 0.5) in group A and 8 (SD, 2 times) in group B (P < 0.001). The total access time was 11 minutes (SD, 2 minutes) in group A and 28 minutes (SD, 5 minutes) in group B (P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: PELD using the fluoroscopy-based navigation system showed lower operative, fluoroscopy, and access time compared with conventional techniques. In addition, fewer fluoroscopy images and access attempts were made in the navigation group. These data suggest that this novel technique reduces fluoroscopy and operation time and may reduce risks of repeated surgical access attempts.

DE Education; Neurosurgery; Sub-internship; Training camp
ID BOOT CAMP; MEDICAL-STUDENTS; SKILLS; RESIDENTS; SOCIETY
AB OBJECTIVE: Historically, medical student education in neurological surgery has generally limited student involvement to assisting in research projects with minimal formal clinical exposure before starting sub-internships and application for the neurosurgery match. Consequently, students have generally had little opportunity to acquire exposure to clinical neurosurgery and attain minimal proficiency. A medical student training camp was created to improve the preparation of medical students for the involvement in neurological surgery activities and sub-internships.
   METHODS: A 1-day course was held at Weill Cornell Medicine, which consisted of a series of morning lectures, an interactive resident lunch panel, and afternoon hands- on laboratory sessions. Students completed self-assessment questionnaires regarding their confidence in several areas of clinical neurosurgery before the start of the course and again at its end.
   RESULTS: A significant increase in self-assessed confidence was observed in all skill areas surveyed. Overall, rising fourth year students who were starting sub-internships in the subsequent weeks reported a substantial increase in their preparedness for the elective rotations in neurosurgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: The preparation of medical students for clinical neurosurgery can be improved. Single-day courses such as the described training camp are an effective method for improving knowledge and skill gaps in medical students entering neurosurgical careers. Initiatives should be developed, in addition to this annual program, to increase the clinical and research skills throughout medical student education.

AB OBJECTIVE: We sought to differentiate glioblastomas from solitary brain metastasis using arterial spin labeling perfusion (ASL)- and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)-derived metrics.
   METHODS: A prospective study was done on 36 patients with provisional diagnosis of glioblastomas versus brain metastasis who underwent ASL and DTI of the brain. The tumor blood flow (TBF) and DTI metrics (fractional anisotropy [FA] and mean diffusivity [MD]) of the enhancing tumoral and peritumoral parts were measured.
   RESULTS: There was a significant difference of TBF (P = 0. 001) and MD (P = 0.001) of the tumoral and peritumoral parts of glioblastoma and metastasis (P = 0.001). There was a significant difference of FA of peritumoral part (P = 0.001) and insignificant difference of tumoral part (P = 0.06) between glioblastomas and metastasis. The cutoff of TBF of tumoral and peritumoral parts used for differentiation were 29.7 and 17.8 (mL/100 g/minute) revealed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.943 and 0.937 with accuracy of 91.7% and 88.9%. The cutoff of MD of tumoral and peritumoral parts were 1.27 and 1.33 (10(-3) mm(2)/second) revealed AUC of 0.840 and 0.987 and accuracy of 83.3% and 91.7%, respectively. Combined TBF, MD, and FA of the peritumoral part revealed AUC of 0.984 and accuracy of 91.7%.
   CONCLUSIONS: A combination of ASL- and DTI-derived metrics of the peritumoral part can be used for differentiation of glioblastomas from solitary brain metastasis.

ID POLYGLYCOLIC ACID; RAT MODEL; REPAIR; INJURIES; REGENERATION; RECOVERY
AB OBJECTIVE: A single-institution case series is reported and a review of the literature on the outcomes of digital nerve gap reconstruction with the NeuraGen type 1 collagen nerve conduit (Integra Life Sciences, Plainsboro New Jersey, USA) and the Avance Nerve Graft (Axogen Inc., Alachua, Florida, USA) is presented.
   METHODS: Thirty-seven patients were included with a minimal follow-up of 12 months. Primary outcome was postoperative sensory recovery measured by static 2-point discrimination test or the Semmes-Weinstein monofilament test. Secondary outcome measurements were perioperative or postoperative complications. Final outcome data were stratified to grade results as excellent, good, or poor.
   RESULTS: The mean nerve gap length was 14 +/- 4.9 mm for the collagen conduits versus 18.4 +/- 9.3 for nerve allografts. After 12 months, outcomes were graded as excellent sensory recovery in 48% of the collagen conduit repairs and 39% of the nerve allografts (P = 0.608), good in 26% of the conduits and 55% of the allografts (P = 0.074), and poor in 26% of the conduits versus 6% of the allografts (P = 0.091). One neuroma and 1 infection were reported. Graft rejection or extrusion was not observed.
   CONCLUSIONS: Nerve conduits and processed nerve allografts offer convenient off-the-shelf options for digital nerve gap repair. Both techniques offer effective means of reconstructing a digital nerve gap <2.5 cm at a minimum of 12 months of follow-up. Future prospective randomized large sample size studies comparing nerve conduits with allografts are needed to perform subgroup analyses and to define their exact role in digital nerve injuries.

TI & para;Effect of Fetal Posterior Circulation on Efficacy of Flow
   Diversion for Treatment of Posterior Communicating Artery Aneurysms: A
   Multi-Institutional Study
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Circle of Willis; Flow diverter; Intracranial aneurysm
ID PIPELINE EMBOLIZATION; ORIGIN
AB BACKGROUND: Flow diversion (FD) has emerged as an effective treatment modality for aneurysms of the posterior communicating artery (PCOM). Whether or not a fetal posterior circulation (FPC) affects PCOM aneurysm occlusion rates after FD remains undetermined.
   METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study in which treatment outcomes for FD of PCOM aneurysms from multiple institutions were reviewed. The primary outcome of interest was complete aneurysm occlusion at last follow-up. The presence of a FPC, defined as a PCOM diameter larger than that of the P1 segment, was noted and its relationship to complete aneurysm occlusion was investigated using a Cox proportional hazards model.
   RESULTS: There were 49 patients with 49 PCOM aneurysms treated with FD who met inclusion criteria for analysis. A FPC was present in 16 patients (32.7%). Complete aneurysm occlusion was observed in 34 patients (69.4%). Complete occlusion was less common for patients with a FPC (43.7% vs. 81.8%; P = 0.007). For patients with and without a FPC, median time to occlusion was 51 and 6 months, respectively (P = 0.002). Using a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model, a FPC was associated with reduced odds of complete occlusion on last follow-up (risk ratio 0.35, 95% confidence interval 0.14-0.89; P = 0.029).
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate reduced efficacy of FD for the treatment of PCOM aneurysms associated with a FPC. These findings may influence treatment selection for aneurysms at this location.

TI Tailor-Made Branch Reconstruction by Intracranial to Intracranial Bypass
   During Clipping Surgery for Middle Cerebral Artery Aneurysms
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Cerebral aneurysm; Clipping; IC-IC bypass; Middle cerebral artery
AB BACKGROUND: In dipping surgery, it can be advantageous to dissect an adherent artery from the aneurysmal dome to achieve complete clipping. Bypass surgery can be useful to reconstruct an adherent artery when dissection of the artery is technically difficult or risky. We report the effectiveness of tailor-made intracranial (IC)-IC bypass to reconstruct an adherent artery in clipping surgery for middle cerebral artery (MCA) aneurysms.
   METHODS: A retrospective review of 384 consecutive patients who had presented with MCA aneurysms from 2008 to 2016 had identified 4 patients who had undergone an IC-IC bypass during clipping surgery for reconstruction of an adherent artery. We analyzed the preoperative radiological findings, methods of bypass surgery, surgical complications, and clinical outcomes in the present study.
   RESULTS: Preoperative angiography showed that the temporal cortical artery coursed along the aneurysmal dome in all cases. These cortical arteries exhibited tight adherence to the aneurysmal body intraoperatively, proving them to be difficult to dissect from the aneurysm. The adherent artery was injured during dissection in 2 cases. These arteries were reconstructed by IC-IC bypass, after which neck clipping was completed. The methods of IC-IC bypass included end-to-end anastomosis in 2 patients, end-to-side anastomosis in 1, and side-to-side anastomosis in 1 patient. Postoperative computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed neither hemorrhagic nor ischemic complications. The postoperative course was uneventful in all the patients.
   CONCLUSIONS: During clipping surgery for MCA aneurysms, tailor-made IC-IC bypass is one of the useful options to reconstruct tightly adherent branch arteries, especially when an external carotid artery graft has not been prepared in advance.

ID I MALFORMATION; FIXATION; IMPROVEMENT; PLATE
AB BACKGROUND: The outcome of neurophysiologic motor evoked potential (MEP) monitoring during surgery for Chiari formation by atlantoaxial fixation and without any bone or dural foramen magnum decompression is analyzed.
   METHODS: During the period August 2017 to October 2018, 20 patients having Chiari formation with or without syringomyelia were surgically treated by atlantoaxial fixation. Apart from other forms of monitoring, MEP monitoring formed the basis of study. MEP monitoring was done during various phases of surgery that included monitoring immediately after screw tightening for atlantoaxial fixation.
   RESULTS: It was observed that there was positive improvement in MEP in 100% of the patients when measured in the surgical stage immediately after the procedure of screw tightening for atlantoaxial fixation. The improvement in MEP correlated with parallel improvement in neurologic function.
   CONCLUSIONS: Improvement in MEP adds credence to the hypothesis that atlantoaxial instability forms the nodal point of pathogenesis of Chiari formation.

DT Article
DE Clipping; Coiling; Meta-analysis; Ruptured intracranial aneurysms
ID CEREBRAL ANEURYSMS; ENDOVASCULAR COILING; FOLLOW-UP
AB BACKGROUND: Hie treatment strategies of ruptured intracranial aneurysms (RIAs) include surgical clipping and endovascular coiling, and the efficacy and safety of clipping versus coiling are yet controversial.
   OBJECTIVE: To summarize the available randomized controlled trials to determine the optimal treatment method for patients with RIA.
   METHODS: PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were systematically searched for randomized controlled trials published up to September 5, 2017. The summary analysis was performed using a random-effects model. The primary outcomes included poor outcome, mortality, and rebleeding, whereas the secondary outcomes included complete occlusion, incomplete occlusion, severe disability, and vegetative state.
   RESULTS: We identified 5 trials with data collected from 2883 patients. The summary results indicated that surgical clipping in patients was associated with a high incidence of poor outcome (relative risk [RR], 1.34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.18-1.51; P < 0.001), whereas no significant effect was observed on mortality (RR, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.79-1.49; P = 0.608) and rebleeding (RR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.20-2.06; P = 0.460) compared with endovascular coiling. Furthermore, we noted that surgical clipping significantly increased the incidence of complete occlusion compared with endovascular coiling (RR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.09 1.55; P = 0.004). Conversely, surgical clipping was associated with a low incidence of incomplete occlusion (RR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.45-0.99; P = 0.044). No significant differences were noted between surgical clipping and endovascular coiling with respect to the outcomes of severe disability (RR, 1.39; 95% CI, 0.90-2.16; P = 0.140) and vegetative state (RR, 1.35; 95% CI, 0.84-2.17; P = 0.213).
   CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis provides moderate evidence that surgical clipping has few benefits than endovascular coiling for the treatment of RIA.

DT Article
DE Health expenditures; Medicare; Normal pressure hydrocephalus
ID SHUNT SURGERY; PREVALENCE; EPIDEMIOLOGY; MODELS; DEATH
AB BACKGROUND: Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is an underdiagnosed and undertreated condition affecting the elderly population and with costs associated with its surgical management reported to be less than those associated with conservative management.
   OBJECTIVE: To determine if the rate of diagnosis of NPH has improved over the last decade, the rate of treatment has increased, and if surgical treatment costs and socioeconomic factors related to receipt of treatment have changed over time compared with conservative therapy.
   METHODS: A retrospective study based on data from a nationally representative random sample of 2,378,637 Medicare beneficiaries (2006-2010) was performed. Shunt surgery, shunt revision, replacement, and removal were analyzed as independent variables.
   RESULTS: A total of 2321 patients with NPH were included, with 580 (24.99%) receiving a first shunt procedure. The adjusted effect of the procedure is that total 5-year expenditures are $11,676 more per patient (P < 0.001) than expenditures associated with nonsurgical management. Shunt revision ($22,715, P < 0.01) and/or replacement ($46,607, P< 0.001) add significantly to 5-year expenditures. Socioeconomic factors including African American race (P = 0.006); age 75-79 years (P = 0.024), 80-84 years (P< 0.001), and >= 85 years (P< 0.001); and Medicaid (P< 0.001) have significant negative associations with shunt surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: There was a 1.66-fold increase in the rate of diagnosis of NPH, from 0.12% in 1999 to 0.2% in 2008 The total costs per surgical patient rose by approximately 145% to 160% comparing 2001 and 2010. This increase was mainly due to hospital (by 167% to 168%) and home health costs (by 118% to 148%). Providing appropriate care across the socioeconomic spectrum warrants further study and requires identifying the factors that limit access to care.

AB BACKGROUND: Recently, interspinous stabilization with the interspinous process device (IPD) has become an alternative to treat lumbar spinal stenosis. The biomechanical influence of different design features of IPDs on intradiscal pressure (IDP) and facet joint force (FJF) has not been fully understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the biomechanical performance of different IPDs using finite element (FE) method.
   METHODS: A FE model of the L1 -5 segments was developed and validated. Four surgical FE models were constructed by inserting different implants at the L3-4 segment (Coflex-F, DIAM, Wallis, and pedicle screw system). The 4 motion modes were simulated.
   RESULTS: The IPDs decreased range of motion (ROM) at the surgical level substantially in flexion and extension, hut little influence was found in lateral bending and torsion. Compared with the DIAM and Wallis devices, the Coflex-F device showed advantages in stabilizing the surgical level, especially in flexion and extension, while it increased FJF at adjacent levels by 26%-27% in extension. Among the 3 IPDs, the DIAM device exhibited the most comparable ROM, IDP, and FJF at adjacent levels compared with the intact lumbar spine. The influence of the Wallis device was between that of the Coflex-F and DIAM devices.
   CONCLUSIONS: Compared with rigid fixation, the IPDs demonstrated less compensation at adjacent levels in terms of ROM, IDP, and FJF, which may lower the incidence of adjacent segment degeneration in the long term.

ID INJURY
AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate clinical outcomes of a case series of 18 patients who underwent fully endoscopic foraminotomy, laminectomy, and transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion combined with percutaneous screw fixation.
   METHODS: This was a retrospective case series of a single surgeon. Average age of patients was 66 years (range, 51-82 years). All patients had grade I or grade II spondylolisthesis and severe central canal stenosis. Patients underwent endoscopic transforaminal access through Kambin triangle for foraminotomy, discectomy, endplate preparation, and interbody fusion, which was followed by fully endoscopic unilateral laminectomy and bilateral decompression and percutaneous pedicle screw and connecting rod placement.
   RESULTS: All procedures were successful without conversion to open surgery. Mean operative time was 168 minutes, and average estimated blood loss was 36 mL. Mean length of hospital stay was 1.2 days. There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications. Comparison of preoperative and final clinical metrics demonstrated that average Oswestry Disability Index score improved from 48 +/- 14 (range, 37-61) to 13 +/- 11 (range, 0-27) (P < 0.001). Average visual analog scale back pain score improved from 8.1 +/- 2.0 (range, 6.8-10.0) to 1.8 +/- 0.9 (range, 0.0-3.5) (P < 0.001). Oswestry Disability Index and visual analog scale back pain scores at last follow-up showed 73% and 78% improvement, respectively, from the preoperative period. There were no cases of nonunion clinically or radiographically on final follow-up of >12 months.
   CONCLUSIONS: Fully endoscopic laminectomy and interbody fusion under conscious sedation is an effective treatment with minimal complications for patients with lumbar spondylolisthesis and severe spinal stenosis.

AB BACKGROUND: The treatment for patients with poor-grade aneurysms defined as World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies (WFNS) grade IV - V is still unclear and controversial. In this research, we compared the clinical efficacy and safety between clipping and coiling in the treatment of ruptured poor-grade anterior circulation aneurysms.
   METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of a hospital database. From January 2013 to May 2018, 94 patients who presented with poor-grade anterior circulation aneurysms were included. Preoperative baseline, post-procedure complications, and outcome (3-month and 6-month modified Rankin Scale scores) were analyzed. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify risk factors of short-term (in-hospital, 30-day) mortality.
   RESULTS: A total of 21 (22%) patients died during short-term follow-up; there was a greater short-term mortality in coiling group (38% vs. 15%, P = 0.015). The incidence of delayed cerebral ischemia and intracranial infection in the clipping group was significantly greater than the coiling group: (33% vs. 14%, P = 0.045) and (68% vs. 41%, P = 0.016). However, coiling group had a greater rate of shunt-dependent hydrocephalus (21% vs. 6%, P = 0.035). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed cerebral vasospasm (odds ratio [OR], 9.22; P < 0.01), admission WFNS grade V (OR, 15.43; P < 0.01), coiling (OR, 5.92; P = 0.013), and postoperative aneurysm rebleeding (OR, 40.04; P = 0.01) would influence the mortality.
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients with ruptured poor-grade anterior circulation aneurysms who undergo microsurgical clipping seem to have a lower short-term mortality. Cerebral vasospasm, WFNS grade V, and postoperative aneurysm rebleeding are associated with short-term mortality.

ID REAL-TIME SONOGRAPHY
AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility of transcranial sonography in patients harboring polymethylmethacrylate cranioplasties (PMMA-CP) and explore whether this material is a valid sonic window to explore intracerebral structures.
   METHODS: In 6 patients, we performed transcranial sonography (TCS), using the PMMA-CP as sonic window. To test the reliability of ultrasound images, we collected several quantitative and qualitative measurements of intracranial structures and compared these sonographic images with standard computed tomography (CT) scan images.
   RESULTS: We found that PMMA-CP is a very good sonic window and allowed us to obtain very good quality echographic images of intracranial structures, as shown by the comparison of measurements with CT scan, which were very reliable. The main drawback was related to the shape (i.e., the curvature) of the cranial flap, which hindered the ultrasound probe from correctly adhering to the scalp.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although limited by the restricted number of cases, this preliminary experience represents the first available data about the serial use of TCS using PMMA-CP as window. These results open the path to the routine use of TCS to longitudinally control patients already harboring PMMA-CP. More, we here discuss its potential role in globally reducing the number of follow-up CT and magnetic resonance imaging scans required in different type of patients and pathologies.

AB BACKGROUND: Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is a entity with a potentially fatal outcome. Patients who do not respond to standard medical therapy alone may benefit from endovascular treatment options. We evaluate the angiographic and clinical results of mechanical thrombectomy in patients with severe CVT.
   METHODS: Endovascular procedures were performed in patients with CVT in addition to standard anticoagulation therapy between 2011 and 2018. Clinical and radiologic parameters, procedure details, and angiographic and clinical outcomes were reviewed retrospectively.
   RESULTS: In total, 14 thrombectomy procedures were executed. Successful recanalization of the occluded sinus was achieved in 86% of cases (12/14); of those, 29% were recanalized completely. Procedural complications included perforation of the transverse sinus in 1 case (7%). Worsening of intracranial hemorrhage occurred in 14% (2/14) of cases. Favorable clinical outcome (modified Rankin Scale score 0-2) was achieved in 12 of 13 patients (92%).
   CONCLUSIONS: Transvenous mechanical thrombectomy is feasible, sate, and effective, leading to a high degree of successful recanalization rate of occluded dural sinus. It may be a salvage treatment for selected patients with severe CVT refractory to standard medical treatment.

AB OBJECTIVE: Developed countries have rapidly aging populations and the use of antithrombotic drugs is increasing. We investigated the effects of antithrombotic drugs and reversal of these drugs in patients with geriatric traumatic brain injury (TBI).
   METHODS: Age, sex, mechanism of injury, Glasgow Coma Scale on admission, head computed tomography findings, antithrombotic therapy, acute exacerbation, and outcomes at discharge were examined in 711 patients with geriatric TBI, complicated with traumatic intracranial hemorrhage using data from the Japan Neurotrauma Data Bank Project 2015 (JNTDB P2015). These items were compared between patients who did and did not receive antithrombotic therapy. We also conducted a questionnaire survey of reversal of antithrombotic therapy at hospitals participating in the JNTDB P2015. Acute exacerbation was compared in hospitals that did and did not regularly use reversal of this therapy.
   RESULTS: The major cause of injury was a fall. In head computed tomography, acute subdural hematoma was found in 65.7% of the subjects. Antithrombotic therapy was performed in 30.4% of subjects, and these subjects were significantly older than those who did not receive this therapy; many had a fall as the mechanism of injury, and the level of consciousness was significantly exacerbated with this therapy. In hospitals that performed regular reversal, late exacerbation of the level of consciousness was suppressed.
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients with geriatric TBI who are given antithrombotic drugs have a risk for late exacerbation, even if initially diagnosed with mild TBI. Therefore, there is a possibility that reversal of antithrombotic drugs is important to suppress the risk of deterioration of patients with TBI.

AB OBJECTIVE: This retrospective cohort study aimed to investigate the change of spinal cord displacements and the occurrence of C5 palsy between anterior controllable antedisplacement and fusion (ACAF) (group A) and single open-door laminoplasty (group L).
   METHODS: From January 2016 to December 2017, a total of 80 patients with cervical ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) were enrolled. All patients underwent computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. The types and extent of OPLL, spinal cord rotation, deviation angle, and distance between the vertebral arteries line and spinal cord (DVS) were measured. Patients with postoperative C5 palsy were recorded. Neurologic function was evaluated by Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score.
   RESULTS: Three days after surgery, patients in group A had better recovery (6.7 degrees +/- 2.4 degrees) of spinal cord rotation than group L (3.1 degrees +/- 0.8 degrees; P < 0.05). Deviation angle showed similar changes to spinal cord rotation. At the final follow-up, patients in group A had decreased DVS (11.0 +/- 0.7 mm), whereas patients in group L had increased DVS (15.1 +/- 0.8 mm) compared with preoperation (P < 0.05). Five patients (1 in group A and 4 in group 1) developed postoperative C5 palsy (P> 0.05). Patients in group A had a higher JOA score at the final follow-up than those in group L (P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: ACAF could achieve in situ decompression in terms of spinal cord rotation, deviation angle, and spinal cord shift with better clinical outcomes and relatively lower incidence of C5 palsy compared with single open-door laminoplasty.

   MANAGEMENT; REMOVAL; FAILURE; RISK
AB BACKGROUND: Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) is now widely used to manage ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) malfunctions, but outcome predictors are still debated. Different opinions exist about the prognostic factors, but shunt duration is generally considered unimportant although its influence remains poorly investigated.
   METHODS: A total of 139 patients undergoing EN for VPS malfunction were reviewed. Successful ETV was defined as shunt independence. There were 56 children and 83 adults; hydrocephalus had different causes. The mean VPS-ETV interval was 8.1 years.
   RESULTS: Ninety patients (64.7%) became shunt free. Children and adults achieved comparable success rates (64.3% and 65.1%, respectively). Age, gender, and cause of shunt malfunction were scarcely significant. The success rates were 86.8% (33/38 patients) in obstructive hydrocephalus (OH), 55.2% (36/67) in communicating hydrocephalus, and 58.8% (21/34) in myelomeningocele-related hydrocephalus, which was significant (P = 0.02). History of multiple revisions was a negative predictor (P < 0.001): success rate, 39% (16/48) versus 81.3% (74/91). Any individual time step increase reduced the odds of ETV success by 34% (P = 0.014). In OH, the results were good regardless of any other factor, including shunt duration. In communicating hydrocephalus, short VPS-ETV intervals correlated with better outcome (P = 0.021), although they were irrelevant in perinatal posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus. In myelomeningocele-related hydrocephalus, shunt duration had intermediate effects.
   CONCLUSIONS: EN is the first option for shunt malfunctions in OH and perinatal posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus, regardless of other factors. Conversely, in other types of hydrocephalus, the chances of shunt independence are lower and shunt duration and history of multiple shunt revisions are significant.

The report about the incidence of CK between patients with AIS and normal populations was little. Patients included in previous studies often required scoliosis surgery (Cobb angle >= 40 degrees), which does not represent all patients with MS. The aims of this study were to compare incidence of CK between patients with AIS (Cobb angle >10) and an age-matched normal population and to identify risk factors related to CK, especially coronal parameters that have rarely been studied in current literature.
   METHODS: Patients with MS (n = 112) and asymptomatic subjects from the general population (control group; = 40) were retrospectively analyzed. Radiographic parameters of coronal and sagittal plane were measured on full-length spine x-rays. Patients with MS were divided into 2 groups based on cervical lordosis angle: cervical lordosis and CK.
   RESULTS: CK was observed in 14 of 40 (35%) subjects in the control group and 68 of 112 (60.7%) patients with AIS. Several parameters were related to CK, including major curve, proximal thoracic, and main thoracic Cobb angle; proximal thoracic kyphosis angle; main thoracic kyphosis angle; T1 slope; sagittal vertical axis; vertical distance between C7 plumb line and center sacral vertical line; apical vertebral translation; T1 coronal tilt; and lumbar pelvic relationship. Logistic regression identified main thoracic Cobb angle, main thoracic kyphosis angle, sagittal vertical axis, lumbar pelvic relationship, and apical vertebral translation as independent risk factors of CK.
   CONCLUSIONS: Incidence of CK increases in patients with AIS relative to normal subjects. Coronal parameters of the spine could influence cervical sagittal alignment.

AB OBJECTIVE: Symptomatic metastatic spine disease (MSD), is a challenging disease involving 3%-20% of patients with bone metastases. Different surgical options are available and must be tailored to the general and neurologic conditions of the patients. Open kyphoplasty (OKP) refers to decompressive hemilaminectomy, associated with a contralateral percutaneous kyphoplasty, and in some cases, to a posterior stabilization. The aim of the study was to critically review our experience during the last decade with OKP in patients with cancer.
   METHODS: Fifty-three patients with cancer underwent OKP for symptomatic MSD. The Tokuhashi score and Spinal Instability Neoplastic Score were calculated for each patient. Length of hospital stay, perioperative complications, incidence of adjacent-level fractures, and median survival after surgery were evaluated. Karnofsky Performance Status, visual analog scale, and Dennis Pain Score were calculated preoperatively, postoperatively, and at last follow-up.
   RESULTS: Median Tokuhashi score and Spinal Instability Neoplastic Score were 10 and 10, respectively. The mean volume of filling material inserted was 3.6 mL. Median operative time was 180 minutes. Complications included 8 leakages (15%), 2 permanent motor deficits (3.8%), and 2 asymptomatic pulmonary embolisms (3.8%). Mean length of hospital stay was 7 days. A significant improvement was observed in Karnofsky Performance Status, visual analog scale score, and Dennis Pain Score (P < 0.0001). Median follow-up was 16 months and overall survival 22 months.
   CONCLUSIONS: OKP was an effective treatment of symptomatic MSDs in selected oncologic patients with low Tokuhashi scores. It relieved lateral epidural compressions, expanded indications of palliative surgery in patients who were not otherwise surgical candidates, and rapidly dealt with cement leakages.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate the mechanism of dexmede- which may provide new ways for clinical treatment of tomidine (Dex) in improving brain damage induced by cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury in rats.
   METHODS: Rats were randomly divided into a sham operation group, ischemia-reperfusion group, Dex group, piracetam group, and yohimbine + Dex group, with 12 rats per group. 2,3,5-Triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining was used to analyze cerebral infarct size. Hematoxylin-eosin staining and immunohistochemistry were used to observe brain damage caused by ischemia-reperfusion. Cognitive and memory functions was detected by Morris water maze test, and the expression of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) and phosphorylated cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element binding protein (CREB) were measured by Western blot.
   RESULTS: Cognitive dysfunction was improved in the Dex group and the piracetam group compared with the ischemia-reperfusion group. Compared with the ischemiareperfusion group, infarct size and neuronal cell death rates were decreased in the Dex group and the piracetam group. The expression of phosphorylated ERK1/2 and phosphorylated CREB in the Dex group was increased, whereas the expression of phosphorylated ERK1/2 and phosphorylated CREB in the yohimbine + Dex group was lower than in the Dex group (P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: Dex improved ischemic brain damage by promoting signal transduction of the ERK/CREB pathway, which may provide new ways for clinical treatment of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury.

AB OBJECTIVE: To describe the technique and initial experience of using a rotational 3-dimensional (3D) fluoroscopy system (O-arm; Medtronic) as intraoperative angiography (IA) in the surgery of cerebral aneurysms.
   METHODS: The 3D IA with O-arm (IAWOA) was performed in a consecutive cohort of patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms. Conventional microsurgical clipping was performed with the assistance of indocyanine green videoangiography. Then the O-arm chassis was brought in, the ipsilateral internal carotid artery was catheterized, and contrasted images were acquired. Resulting datasets were exported in Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine and processed using the Osirix software in an accessory computer. The 3D image reconstruction was evaluated intraoperatively to confirm aneurysm occlusion and parent vessel patency. Afterward, agreement among IAWOA, indocyanine green videoangiography, and standard postoperative angiography was analyzed.
   RESULTS: The initial pilot study was performed in 6 patients with 7 unruptured aneurysms. The aneurysm occlusion rate was 100%. The concordance of the IAWOA and the standard postoperative angiography was complete, both in terms of occlusion and parent vessel patency. No complications derived from the IAWOA were observed except in 1 patient, who presented a retroperitoneal hematoma without clinical consequences.
   CONCLUSIONS: The 3D rotational fluoroscopy (O-arm) device could be safely and effectively used as an IA system in selected patients. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study reporting its use as an IA device. This technique seems to offer excellent image quality that could be compared with that of the gold standard 3D digital subtraction angiography but with a lower cost and versatility of use for other subspecialties.

AB OBJECTIVE: The preservation of acceptable facial nerve (FN) function after surgery is the key concern for most patients with vestibular schwannomas (VS). To assess predictive factors of early postoperative and long-term FN function in patients harboring large VS operated with a FN-sparing technique.
   METHODS: Single-center retrospective cohort study with 169 consecutive large VS operated on between January 2003 and May 2015. Clinical, radiologic, and intraoperative factors were assessed according to FN function.
   RESULTS: At last follow-up examination, among the 145 patients without preoperative FN palsy, FN function was good (House-Brackmann [HB] grades I or II) in 84% and moderate (HB grade III) in 15% of patients. Only 1 patient presented with poor HB grade IV function. Multivariate logistic regression model showed the mean preoperative VS extrameatal diameter as being an independent predictor of an unfavorable initial FN outcome (odds ratio [OR], 1.062; P = 0.038). Surgical anatomic preservation of the cochlear nerve was associated with better FN outcomes (OR, 0.237; P = 0.012). A history of previous surgery seemed to be related to long-term impaired FN function (OR, 71.405; P = 0.042), as well as early postoperative FN function (OR, 19.068; P = 0.000). No correlation was found between a history of previous Gamma Knife surgery treatment (P = 0.225) or the extent of resection (P = 0.438) and impaired FN outcomes. History of previous surgery was identified as an unfavorable predictive recovery factor of impaired postoperative FN function (P = 0.034).
   CONCLUSIONS: As long as the extent of resection or additional Gamma Knife surgery have not been identified as predictive risk factors of postoperative FN palsy, we suggest that optimal resection is the main option for patients harboring large VS.

AB OBJECTIVE: Although canine stroke models have several intrinsic advantages, establishing consistent and reproducible territorial stroke in these models has been challenging because of the abundance of collateral circulation. We have described a skull-base surgical approach that yields reproducible stroke volumes.
   METHODS: Ten male beagles were studied. In all 10 dogs, a craniectomy was performed to expose the circle of Willis. Cerebral aneurysm clips were temporarily applied to the middle cerebral artery (MCA), anterior cerebral artery (ACA), posterior cerebral artery, and/or ophthalmic artery (OA) for 1 hour, followed by cauterization of the distal MCA pial collateral vessels. Indocyanine green angiography was performed to assess the local blood flow to the intended area of infarction. The dogs' neurologic examination was evaluated, and the stroke burden was quantified using magnetic resonance imaging.
   RESULTS: High mortality was observed after 1-hour clip occlusion of the posterior cerebral artery, MCA, ACA, and OA (n = 4). Without coagulation of the MCA collateral vessels, 1-hour occlusion of the MCA and/or ACA and OA yielded inconsistent stroke volumes (n = 2). In contrast, after coagulation of the distal MCA pial collateral vessels, 1-hour occlusion of the MCA, ACA, and OA yielded consistent territorial stroke volumes (n = 4; average stroke volume, 9.13 +/- 0.90 cm(3) ; no surgical mortalities), with reproducible neurologic deficits.
   CONCLUSION: Consistent stroke volumes can be achieved in male beagles using a skull base surgical approach with temporary occlusion of the MCA, ACA, and OA when combined with cauterization of the distal MCA pial collateral vessels.

AB OBJECTIVE: We tested the hypothesis that low hemoglobin levels are associated with acute seizures after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH).
   METHODS: Patients with ruptured intracranial aneurysms were enrolled in the observational cohort study that prospectively collected age, sex, symptom onset, history of diabetes and hypertension, history of coronary artery disease, temperature, Hunt-Hess grade, Fisher grade, aneurysm location, hemoglobin, hematocrit, serum potassium, sodium, calcium, phosphorus, iron, and modified Rankin Scale. Acute seizures were determined as seizures within 1 week after aSAH.
   RESULTS: We included 554 patients with requisite data for analysis in the prospective study. Incidence of acute seizures following aSAH was 3.61%. In the univariate analysis, significant differences were detected in admission Hunt-Hess grade, Fisher grade, hemoglobin, and serum iron between epilepsy and nonepilepsy groups. Furthermore, acute seizures were associated with higher modified Rankin Scale score and poor outcome (P = 0.004). Serum hemoglobin levels were 114.30 +/- 20.08 g/L in the epilepsy group, which were lower than those in the nonepilepsy group (128.64 +/- 17.94 mmol/L, P = 0.001). Serum iron levels were 8.89 +/- 5.03 g/L in the epilepsy group, which were also lower than those in the nonepilepsy group (13.71 +/- 6.70 mmol/L, P = 0.002). The hemoglobin level was positively correlated with serum iron on admission (p = 0.321, P = 0.000). In the multivariate logistic regression model, lower hemoglobin was considered as an independent risk factor of acute seizures (odds ratio 4.286, 95% confidence interval 1.492-12.315, P = 0.007). The optimal cutoff value for hemoglobin level as a predictor for acute epilepsy after aSAH was determined as 119 g/L in the receiver operating characteristic curve (sensitivity was 75.00%, and specificity was 69.48%).
   CONCLUSIONS: These data support the hypothesis that hemoglobin was inversely associated with acute seizures following aSAH.

AB OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the spinal cord injury range in patients with tethered cord syndrome (TCS) who had urinary incontinence.
   METHODS: We included 30 subjects in the present study, 15 with tethered cord syndrome and urinary incontinence and 15 normal volunteers. All 30 subjects underwent magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) were calculated from a region of interest). All the patients and volunteers were measured 4 segments above the conus medullaris.
   RESULTS: All the FA values and ADC values could be measured from the DTI scans in the normal volunteers and patients. The average ADC value was 1.244 +/- 0.061 in the control group and 1.052 +/- 0.045 in the TCS group. The difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). The average FA value was 0.866 +/- 0.030 in the control group and 1.079 +/- 0.049 in the TCS group, with a statistically significant difference (P < 0.05). The differences in the ADC values in each segment were statistically significant in the 2 groups, although only the difference in the FA value of the fourth segment above the conus medullaris was statistically significant in the 2 groups.
   CONCLUSION: DTI can detect the spinal cord damage range in patients with TCS. In the patients with urinary incontinence, the spinal cord damage was widespread, and the most severe lesion was at the fourth segment above the conus medullaris. This might indicate that decompression of the spinal cord should at least include the fourth segment above the conus medullaris.

ID SURGICAL-MANAGEMENT; ADULTS; MYELOMENINGOCELE; CHILDREN
AB OBJECTIVE: Tethered cord syndrome is a rare and intractable disease. The aim of this study was to investigate surgical outcome of homogeneous spinal-shortening axial decompression (HSAD) for tethered cord syndrome through a minimum 3-year follow-up.
   METHODS: Patients who underwent HSAD for tethered cord syndrome in our institution between May 2011 and July 2015 were included in this study. After a minimum 3-year follow-up, radiologic and clinical data were collected. Surgical outcome was evaluated with Japanese Orthopaedic Association, visual analog scale, International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire- Short Form, and Rintala scores and urodynamics.
   RESULTS: The study included 64 patients (28 men and 36 women) with a mean age of 35.7 +/- 18.1 years. Significant improvement of visual analog scale and Japanese Orthopaedic Association scores was noted postoperatively and at a minimum 3-year follow-up. At the final follow-up, Japanese Orthopaedic Association and visual analog scale scores in all patients were improved compared with preoperatively. The International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form score was decreased from 14.94 +/- 4.15 preoperatively to 7.63 +/- 4.40 at final follow-up (P < 0.01). Rintala score was improved from 5.26 +/- 3.45 preoperatively to 12.32 +/- 3.43 at final follow-up (P < 0.01). All urodynamic parameters improved compared with preoperatively.
   CONCLUSIONS: HSAD was effective and safe. The results were satisfactory with a minimum 3-year follow-up. HSAD could be an alternative surgical treatment of TCS.

   ANATOMY; FUSIFORM ANEURYSM; A1 SEGMENT
AB BACKGROUND: Proximal anterior cerebral artery (A1) aneurysms are difficult to clip because of their frequent proximity to perforators, location behind the parent artery, or adherence to surrounding structures.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed a consecutive series of patients with A1 aneurysms and report the clinical status, radiologic findings, treatment methods, and outcome.
   RESULTS: This series included 19 male and 12 female patients with a mean age of 50 years. The morphology of the A1 aneurysms was fusiform in 2 patients and saccular in the remaining 29 patients. Multiple aneurysms were presented in 9 patients (29.0%). On admission, 26 patients (83.9%) presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage, 3 of whom had an additional intracerebral hematoma. All surgeries were performed with a standard pteriomal craniotomy. The mean Glasgow Outcome Scale score at final follow-up was 4.8 (interquartile range, 5, 5), with 26 patients (83.9%) rated as 5. The mean follow-up time was 38.5 months (range, 12-60 months).
   CONCLUSIONS: A1 aneurysms are rare but have their own complex characteristics and are difficult to treat. Meticulous analysis of the relevant angiographs is needed for their diagnosis. An important consideration in surgery is the preservation of perforators and prevention of rupture. Wide opening of the sylvian fissure and temporary control of the parent artery can facilitate dissection of the A1 aneurysms dome. Multiple intraoperative monitoring methods, such as microvascular Doppler ultrasonography and somatosensory and motor evoked potential monitoring, can reduce the relevant complications of surgery.

AB OBJECTIVE: Occipitalization of the atlas (OA) often is associated with atlantoaxial dislocation and basilar invagination. The purpose of this study is to determine the biomechanical difference between normal and OA conditions in the craniovertebral junction and to further explore the rationale for development of atlantoaxial dislocation and basilar invagination using the finite element model (FEM).
   METHODS: A ligamentous, nonlinear, sliding-contact, 3-dimensional FEM of the occipitoatlantoaxial complex was generated. Validation of the model was accomplished by comparing kinematic predictions with experimental data. We defined the atlantooccipital joint as a tie contact to simulate the OA deformity. The range of motion and the value of the maximum Von Mises stress were compared between the intact and OA models.
   RESULTS: We found all of the predicted data in the intact FEM fell within 1 standard deviation of the cadaver data for all 6 loadings. The OA simulation significantly reduced the overall range of motion of the occipitoatlantoaxial complex at all loadings. The maximum Von Mises stress was predicted to increase at the transverse ligament and the superior articular facet of the axis for all the flexion, extension, lateral bending, and axial rotation loadings.
   CONCLUSIONS: The OA could result in hypermobility of the atlantoaxial segment and cause overstress in the transverse ligament and the lateral atlantoaxial joints. These changes explain the pathogenesis of atlantoaxial dislocation and basilar invagination associated with OA. Follow-up should be scheduled regularly due to the nature of the dynamic development of atlantoaxial dislocation and basilar invagination.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the early and midterm outcomes of surgical correction for severe dystrophic cervical kyphosis in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1) and analyze the pathomechanics and the influence on surgical efficacy of related systemic skeletal dystrophy.
   METHODS: Ten patients who underwent surgical correction for NF-1-related severe dystrophic cervical kyphosis were reviewed. Radiographic parameters, including local and global Cobb angle, sagittal vertical axis, and T-1 slope, were measured. The visual analog scale score, Japanese Orthopaedic Association score, Neck Disability Index, Patient Satisfaction Index, and complications were evaluated.
   RESULTS: The average follow-up was 50.6 months. The local and global Cobb angle improved from the preoperative average of 82.0 degrees and 54.9 degrees to an average of 35.6 degrees and 29.8 degrees, respectively, at the time of final follow-up. The C2-7 sagittal vertical axis averaged 5.8 mm before surgery and 8.9 mm at the final follow-up. The average T1 slope was -12.3 degrees before surgery and -1.6 degrees at the final follow-up. The visual analog scale score, Japanese Orthopaedic Association score, and Neck Disability Index improved significantly, and the overall satisfaction rate was 90.0%. One death and 4 instrumentation failures occurred, 3 patients showed progression of the kyphosis, and 2 fusion failures were observed.
   CONCLUSIONS: Surgical correction, specifically the combined anteroposterior procedure, is essential and effective for management of NF-1-related severe dystrophic cervical kyphosis. However, high incidences of instrumentation failure, kyphosis progression, and fusion failure were observed. NF-1-related continuous skeletal dystrophy caused by multiple metabolic factors remarkably affected the midterm outcomes. Early prevention and targeted pharmacotherapy may be necessary.

AB BACKGROUND: The lower dim (LC) is one of the most difficult areas to access in neurosurgery. Several microsurgical approaches to the LC have been reported, including the subtonsillar, far-lateral (FL), extreme-lateral (EL), and endoscopic far-medial (Endo-FM). However, no consensus has been reached regarding the optimal approach. We aimed to quantify and compare the surgical exposure and freedom (angle of attack) for various targets at the LC using these 4 surgical approaches.
   METHODS: The subtonsillar, FL, EL, and Endo-FM approaches were performed on 5 cadaveric specimens (total 10 sides). Surgical exposure and freedom were measured using the neuronavigation system.
   RESULTS: At the LC, the Endo-FM approach provided the greatest area of exposure (459.3 +/- 82.2 mm(2)). For surgical freedom, the EL approach provided the greatest angle of attack at the jugular foramen (98.1 degrees +/- 9.2 degrees) and hypoglossal canal (128.8 degrees +/- 26.1 degrees). The Endo-FM was the only approach that provided access to the midline of the LC in all specimens. However, the surgical freedom at the midline (20.9 degrees +/- 2.4 degrees at the level of the jugular foramen; 24.2 degrees +/- 2.9 degrees at the level of hypoglossal canal) was limited by its deep surgical corridor (104.3 +/- 11.2 mm) compared with the EL and FL approaches.
   CONCLUSION: The Endo-FM approach provided the greatest surgical freedom at the ventral aspect but the least freedom at the lateral aspect. The EL approach provided maximal values for most parameters among the open approaches; however, the craniotomy with the EL approach was the most complicated. Our quantitative results could guide neurosurgeons in preoperative planning for LC lesions, including awareness of the maximum exposure limits and the advantages and disadvantages of each surgical approach.

AB OBJECTIVE: To compare the treatment results between 1-level vertebral column decancellation (VCD) and pedicle subtraction osteotomy (PSO) for correcting severe kyphotic deformity in ankylosing spondylitis (AS). VCD and PSO have been used to correct AS-related kyphotic deformity, but the differences on correcting results between VCD and PSO are not clear.
   METHODS: Between 2013 and 2015, 57 patients underwent 1-level spinal osteotomy (VCD: n = 30; PSO: n = 27) for correcting kyphotic deformity. Sagittal parameters, fusion results, surgical information, and clinical outcomes were documented and compared. All data were obtained before and 1 week after surgery, 6 months after surgery, and at final follow-up (at least 2 years).
   RESULTS: VCD provided significantly greater osteotomy angle (50.8 degrees +/- 9.7 degrees ) than PSO (38.5 degrees +/- 6.1 degrees ). In the VCD group, the change of the anterior column was 5.0 +/- 1.3 mm, which was larger than the PSO group. The middle column was shortened by 9.9 +/- 2.0 mm and 19.1 +/- 3.3 mm in the VCD group and PSO group, respectively. There was no significant difference in operating time and blood loss between the 2 groups. All cases had solid fusion. Between the 2 groups, Scoliosis Research Society Outcomes Instrument-22 scores were similar at the final follow-up. No major acute complications occurred in both groups.
   CONCLUSIONS: VCD is a safe and effective method in treating rigid kyphotic deformity secondary to AS. VCD provides a larger correction angle in one segment and preserves more height of osteotomized vertebrae than PSO.

AB OBJECTIVE: To observe the efficacy of intravenous, topical, and combined application of tranexamic acid (TXA) in patients with thoracolumbar fracture fixed with percutaneous pedicle screw, and to identify the optimal application method of TXA.
   METHODS: A total of 181 patients with thoracolumbar fracture treated with percutaneous pedicle screw fixation were enrolled in this randomized controlled trial and were randomly classified into 3 groups, including group A (intravenous group), group B (topical group), and group C (combined group). The total blood loss (TBL), hidden blood loss (HBL), intraoperative blood loss (IBL), preoperative D-dimer, postoperative D-dimer, incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and incidence of other complications were compared and analyzed among the 3 groups.
   RESULTS: TBL, HBL, and IBL in the topical group 24 hours after operation were higher (P < 0.05) than those in the intravenous group and combined group, whereas the difference between the intravenous group and combined group was not statistically significant. Meanwhile, there was no statistically significant difference in operation time, preoperative D-dimer, and postoperative D-dimer among the 3 groups (P> 0.05), but D-dimer in all groups at 72 hours after surgery was higher than that before surgery. No DVT or other complication was observed in the patients.
   CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative intravenous drip of TXA can remarkably reduce intraoperative HBL and IBL in patients with thoracolumbar fracture fixed with percutaneous pedicle screw. Nonetheless, intraoperative topical application of TXA before wound closure is not recommended.

AB OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to report 4 cases diagnosed with trigeminal schwannomas (TS), among whom tumor in epidural space of middle fossa broke through dura mater into subdural space, and to analyze the potential reason for recurrence of TS in middle fossa after surgical removal by endoscopic endonasal approach (EEA) or interdural approach.
   METHODS: The information of 4 patients diagnosed with TS who were surgically treated was retrospectively analyzed and the selection of approaches, surgical strategies, and potential reason for recurrence after middle fossa TS removal by EEA and interdural approach were discussed.
   RESULTS: During last 10 years, 43 patients with TS received surgical treatment at Xuan Wu Hospital of Capital Medical University, among whom 1 patient with TS extending from middle fossa to infratemporal fossa was first treated by EEA, then the tumor recurred and the patient underwent a second operation via a frontotemporal subdural approach. During the second operation, we found part of tumor had broken through the dura mater into subdural space. Moreover, this phenomenon was detected in another 3 patients with middle-posterior fossa TS.
   CONCLUSIONS: TS in middle fossa has been widely believed to be totally located at epidural space, whereas we found that it could occasionally breach into subdural space and accept blood supply from the pial artery. We believe this could be the potential reason for recurrence after tumor resection by EEA and interdural approach.

AB OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare the efficacy and complications of lumboperitoneal (LP) and ven-triculoperitoneal (VP) shunt surgeries in patients with posthemorrhagic communicating hydrocephalus.
   METHODS: Retrospective analysis of the records of patients who were admitted to the Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital Affiliated to Tongji University between February 2012 and January 2018 was performed. The efficacy of the LP and VP shunt surgeries and their associated complications were compared. The evaluation of the efficacy of these surgeries involved both clinical and radiologic aspects. The evaluated complications included hemorrhage, infection, excessive drainage, seizure disorder, shunt obstruction, and migration. Revision and mortality were regarded as the consequence of complications and were collected.
   RESULTS: One-hundred and fifty-eight (115 males and 43 females) patients were treated with VP or LP shunt (102 vs. 56, respectively) for posthemorrhagic communicating hydrocephalus. The percentage of patients with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score between 3.00 and 12.00 was 79.11%. There was no significant difference in the observed clinical (P = 0.097) or radiologic (P = 0.360) improvements between the LP and VP shunt groups. The total rate of complications (P = 0.009) and hemorrhage (P = 0.03) were lower in the LP shunt group than in the VP shunt group.
   CONCLUSIONS: In the treatment of moderate and severe coma patients with posthemorrhagic communicating hydrocephalus, LP shunt surgery is equally as effective as the VP shunt surgery and is associated with fewer complications.

ID INTRACEREBRAL HEMORRHAGE; ELEVATED HEMOGLOBIN; PRESSURE; EDEMA
AB OBJECTIVE: Hypertensive cerebral hemorrhage leads to greater mortality and worse functional outcomes at high altitudes. Experimental studies have suggested that hemoglobin can lead to increased perihemorrhagic edema after intracerebral hemorrhage.
   METHODS: Patients were divided into a high-hemoglobin (H-H) group (>180 g/L) and a low-hemoglobin (L-H) group (<= 180 g/L). The distance from the cortex to the midline was used to indicate the degree of edema. At 1, 7, 14, and 21 days, the patients' status was scored using the Glasgow coma scale, and survival was plotted using Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Pearson correlation analysis showed that the difference between the postoperative and preoperative Glasgow coma scale score correlated with the hemoglobin concentration. The Glasgow outcome scale was used to assess neurological recovery after 6 months.
   RESULTS: On days 7, 14, and 21, the edema of the H-H group was significantly greater than that of the L-H group (P< 0.01 and P < 0.001, respectively). The edema of the H-H group peaked at 14 and 21 days, but that of the L-H group peaked at 7 days. The hemoglobin concentration and postoperative neurological recovery had a linear relationship in the H-H group. The L-H group had greater survival compared with the H-H group (P < 0.05). The L-H group had higher Glasgow outcome scale scores compared with the H-H group (P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSION: The hemoglobin concentration affects the mortality and morbidity from hypertensive cerebral hemorrhage in high-altitude regions, and a linear relationship exists between hemoglobin concentration and neurological recovery in the H-H group.

   Vascular anatomy
ID PREOPERATIVE EMBOLIZATION; TUMORS; DIAGNOSIS; SPINE
AB BACKGROUND: Preoperative endovascular embolization of atypical hemangiomas of the spine can reduce intraoperative blood loss. One frequent concern raised about embolizing these tumors is a possible association with arteries feeding the spinal cord, such as the artery of Adamkiewicz. This study aimed to elucidate a relationship between spinal levels affected by atypical spinal hemangiomas and radiculomedullary arteries.
   METHODS: This was a retrospective review of 8 patients undergoing preoperative embolization of atypical spinal hemangiomas. We evaluated 54 spinal levels by angiography during embolization procedures. Each spinal level was categorized on the basis of the presence or absence of tumor and radiculomedullary artery.
   RESULTS: Six of 15 (40%) affected levels had an associated radiculomedullary artery. Four of 39 (10.2%) unaffected levels had an associated cord feeding artery. The relative risk of affected spinal levels having an associated radiculomedullary artery was 3.9 (95% confidence interval 1.28-11.91). The attributable risk was 0.40 (95% CI 0.12-0.76). The chi-squared statistic was 6.35, with a P value of 0.01. Six of 8 patients (75%) had a radiculomedullary artery at a level of disease and embolization.
   CONCLUSIONS: In this study, spinal levels affected by atypical hemangiomas requiring surgery were associated with radiculomedullary arteries. When performing preoperative embolization, great care must be taken to identify and preserve arteries supplying the spinal cord.

ID OPERATIVE SKILLS; PERFORMANCE; PROFICIENCY; NEUROTOUCH; RESIDENTS
AB BACKGROUND: Adequate assessment and feedback remains a cornerstone of psychomotor skills acquisition, particularly within neurosurgery where the consequence of adverse operative events is significant. However, a critical appraisal of the reliability of visual rating scales in neurosurgery is lacking. Therefore, we sought to design a study to compare visual rating scales with simulated metrics in a neurosurgical virtual reality task.
   METHODS: Neurosurgical faculty rated anonymized participant video recordings of the removal of simulated brain tumors using a visual rating scale made up of seven composite elements. Scale reliability was evaluated using generalizability theory, and scale subcomponents were compared with simulated metrics using Pearson correlation analysis.
   RESULTS: Four staff neurosurgeons evaluated 16 medical student neurosurgery applicants. Overall scale reliability and internal consistency were 0.73 and 0.90, respectively. Reliability of 0.71 was achieved with two raters. Individual participants, raters, and scale items accounted for 27%, 11%, and 0.6% of the data variability. The hemostasis scale component related to the greatest number of simulated metrics, whereas respect for no-go zones and tissue was correlated with none. Metrics relating to instrument force and patient safety (brain volume removed and blood loss) were captured by the fewest number of rating scale components.
   CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study comparing participant's ratings with simulated performance. Given rating scales capture less well instrument force, quantity of brain volume removed, and blood loss, we suggest adopting a hybrid educational approach using visual rating scales in an operative environment, supplemented by simulated sessions to uncover potentially problematic surgical technique.

ID GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; GENETIC-VARIANTS; SUSCEPTIBILITY;

AB BACKGROUND: Previous studies showed that several variants located around the IRX family may have functional roles in the development of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). However, there was lack of knowledge concerning the target gene of the region on 5p13.3 and the role of IRX genes in the etiology of AIS. This study aimed to validate the relationship between the IRX family and AIS in a large-scale general population and to further investigate the target gene of the region, which was associated with AIS.
   METHODS: SNP rs12517904 and rs117273909 were gen-otyped in 1323 patients and 1670 age-matched healthy controls. Paraspinal muscle was collected from 70 AIS patients and 20 congenital scoliosis patients. Student's t-test was used to compare the IRX1 expression between AIS patients and controls. The 1-way analysis of variance test was used to compare the expression of the IRX genes among different genotypes.
   RESULTS: For rs12517904, patients were found to have a significantly higher frequency of allele T than the controls (37.6% vs. 34.7%, P = 0.02). Allele T can significantly add to the risk of AIS with an odds ratio of 1.14. AIS patients were found to have significantly lower IRX1 expression than the controls. Patients with genotype TT were found to have significantly lower IRX1 expression than those with genotype GG.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our large-scale case control study validated that the IRX1 gene could be the disease-associated gene of AIS. The variant rs12517904 of the IRX1 gene is functionally associated with the development of AIS in the Chinese population. The role of IRX1 in the onset of AIS is worthy of further investigation.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate the position of the aorta relative to the spine in patients with de novo lumbar scoliosis (DLS).
   METHODS: This study enrolled 142 patients with DLS, including 80 cases of left thoracolumbar/ lumbar scoliosis (left group) and 62 cases of right scoliosis (right group). In addition, 132 cases free of deformity were allocated to the control group. Parameters of the Cobb angle and apical vertebrae were measured by radiograph, whereas the left pedicle-vertebrae angle (alpha), rotation angle (gamma), and left pedicle-vertebrae distance (d) of T12-L4 were obtained by magnetic resonance imaging. Independent sample t test was performed to compare alpha, gamma, and d between the DLS and control groups, followed by a Pearson correlation analysis to study the correlation between Cobb angle and alpha, gamma, and d.
   RESULTS: No difference was found between the right group and control group (P [0.554). The value of mean d (4.62 +/- 0.57 cm) gradually increased from T12 to L4 in the left group and showed significant difference with the corresponding value in the control group (4.44 +/- 0.43 cm; P < 0.001). There was no significant difference between the right group and control group (P [0.762). The value of mean d (4.54 +/- 1.84 cm) showed no significant difference between the right group and control group (P [0.530). The correlation analysis showed a significant correlation between rotation angle g and Cobb angle (P < 0.001), but not in a and d with Cobb angle.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although the position of the aorta relative to the spine showed no significant difference between patients with DLS and normal subjects, great attention should still be paid to prevent DLS-induced aorta injury.

AB BACKGROUND: The relationship between noncontrast computed tomography (CT) markers, which predict the expansion of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) under conservative treatment, and postoperative rebleeding (PR) after treatment by directly removing the sICH is unknown. This study investigated the relationship between noncontrast CT markers and PR in patients with sICH treated by endoscopic surgery.
   METHODS: The study population included 92 patients with available data who underwent endoscopic surgery for sICH at our institution from January 2010 to September 2018. The correlations between PR and preoperative noncontrast CT markers, including the blend sign, hypodensities, black hole sign, heterogeneous density, and island signs, were retrospectively evaluated.
   RESULTS: In 5 of the 18 patients (27.8%) with the blend sign, PR developed, whereas only 5 of 74 patients (6.8%) without the blend sign developed PR. In the univariate regression analyses, manifestation of hydrocephalus (odds ratio [OR], 8.75; 95%) confidence interval [CI], 2.15-35.68; P = 0.002), presence of the blend sign (OR, 5.31; 95% CI, 1.34-20.97; P = 0.02), and insertion of external ventricular drainage (OR, 13.88; 95% CI, 3.22-59.77; P < 0.001) were significant risk factors. The other radiographic markers were not associated with PR. In a multivariate analysis, the presence of the blend sign (OR, 22.07; 95% CI, 2.18-773.60; P = 0.009) was the only independent predictor of PR.
   CONCLUSIONS: The blend sign is likely to he a strong predictor for PR in patients who undergo endoscopic surgery for sICH. To improve the prognosis of patients with sICH, further studies are needed to establish new treatment strategies and surgical procedures.

AB OBJECTIVE: Recently, full endoscopic transforaminal decompression surgery (FETDS) under local anesthesia has been used to treat symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis (SLSS) in selective patients. Considering the minimal injury associated with this technique, it has a potential advantage for geriatric patients. In addition, combining thorough preoperative assessments and preparations with this technique to achieve a safer and more effective outcome for geriatric patients with SLSS is necessary.
   METHODS: Between June 2015 and September 2016, after thorough preoperative assessments and preparations, 56 geriatric patients who underwent FETDS with a median 18 months follow-up were enrolled in this study. Clinical results were assessed using the Oswestry Disability Index, visual analog scale (VAS), and the modified Macnab criteria.
   RESULTS: The median duration of surgery was 75 minutes. The mean VAS score for preoperative leg pain was 6.54 +/- 0.66, which improved to 1.79 +/- 0.80, 1.50 +/- 0.79, 1.43 +/- 0.85, and 1.39 +/- 0.97 after surgery, at 3 months, at 6 months, and at the last follow-up, respectively. The mean VAS score for preoperative low back pain was 2.00 +/- 1.01, which changed to 2.09 +/- 0.79, 2.07 +/- 0.83, 2.09 +/- 0.92, and 2.23 +/- 0.76 at the same evaluation times, respectively. The mean preoperative Oswestry Disability Index was 69.30 +/- 6.07, which improved to 22.36 +/- 8.35, 22.32 +/- 8.47, 22.21 +/- 6.61, and 24.57 +/- 8.23, respectively. The modified Macnab criteria were consistent with excellent or good outcomes in 91.1% of patients. Three patients (5.4%) developed complications.
   CONCLUSIONS: FETDS was effective and safe in the treatment of SLSS in geriatric patients, with minimal physiologic impact, taking advantage of the current protocol of thorough assessments and appropriate preoperative preparation.

AB BACKGROUND: Accurate survival estimate is necessary when determining the most appropriate treatment modality for metastatic spinal tumor. The main purpose of this study was to identify the prognostic factors of spinal metastasis and establish a decision tree model.
   METHODS: A consecutive cohort of 507 patients from 3 institutional clinical centers who were treated for metastatic spinal tumor between 2005 and 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. In total, 70% of the participants were randomly selected as a "training sample." The prognostic effect of preoperative factors was evaluated using the "training sample," and a decision tree model was established. Then, the accuracy of the new model, as well as the Tokuhashi and Tomita score, was tested by the "test sample," which consisted of the remaining 30% of participants.
   RESULTS: A decision tree model was generated based on the significant factors with an order of descending importance on predicting the prognosis. According to the new model, patients were classified into 3 groups, mean survival times of less than 6 months, 6-12 months, and more than 12 months, who were indicated for conservative therapy/palliative operation, palliative operation, and invasive excision, respectively. The newly established model was confirmed to be of high accuracy in predicting overall survival, whereas the Tokuhashi and Tomita scores were of modest accuracy and consistency.
   CONCLUSIONS: A new decision tree model for prognosis prediction in spinal metastasis was established with a satisfactory accuracy and consistency. However, the Tokuhashi and Tomita systems were presented to be less correlated between the scores and actual survival.

AB OBJECTIVE: Designing surgical strategies for ossified lesions in the upper cervical spine is challenging owing to the complex anatomic structures. The present study aimed to clarify the prevalence of ossified lesions in the upper cervical spine in patients with ossification in the posterior longitudinal ligament and illustrate the clinical features, radiological findings, and surgical outcomes of this abnormality.
   METHODS: Demographic and clinical data were collected for all patients preoperatively and included age, gender, body mass index, alcohol and tobacco use, history of diabetes, visual analog score, and Japanese Orthopaedic Association score. The cervical angle, morphology of ossification in the posterior longitudinal ligament, K-line, occupation ratio, space available for the spinal cord, high-intensity zone, and compression ratio of the spinal cord were calculated. The operative approach, technique used, and complications were recorded.
   RESULTS: A total of 38 patients were enrolled. The upper cervical segment in 23 patients was not surgically addressed. In the group with the upper cervical segment addressed surgically, 10 patients were treated with C3-C6 open-door laminoplasty and C2 partial laminectomy, 1 with C1-C7 laminoplasty, 1 with C2-C7 laminoplasty, 2 with C3-C6 total and C2 partial laminectomy, and 1 with C1-C5 laminectomy and occipitocervical fusion.
   CONCLUSIONS: The development of ossified lesions in the upper cervical spine has a high incidence. Decompressive surgery for upper cervical spine segments should be recommended for patients with severe narrowing of the spinal canal and a high signal intensity that extends to the upper cervical segment of the spinal cord. We hope that the findings from the present study will aid in clinical decision-making and provide useful information that can be incorporated into future guidelines.

AB BACKGROUND: Chordomas are slow-growing but locally invasive tumors. The standard of care consists of surgical resection and radiotherapy (RT) when complete resection is not possible. The reported data has reached equivocal results regarding the effect of adding RT to increase patient survival. We investigated the effect of adjuvant RT on patient survival.
   METHODS: The National Cancer Database was queried for patients with a diagnosis of sacral and vertebral column chordoma from 2004 to 2010. The primary outcome was overall survival, which was assessed using Kaplan-Meier plots. Cox proportional hazards were performed to evaluate the effect of each treatment modality on survival after adjusting for an array of patient demographics, facility type, and tumor characteristics.
   RESULTS: The data from 282 patients with chordoma were analyzed; 209 patients (74.1%) had undergone gross total resection (GTR) alone. The median follow-up period for the GTR alone and GTR plus RT groups was 63.4 and 67.6 months, respectively. The mean survival was comparable between patients receiving GTR alone and those receiving adjuvant RT, for both sacral (7.7 and 6.9 years, respectively; P = 0.56) and vertebral chordoma (8.8 and 6.2 years, respectively; P = 0.59). Using Cox proportional hazards, we found that compared with GTR alone, GTR plus adjuvant RT did not add any significant survival benefit, for patients with either sacral chordoma (hazard ratio, 0.55; P = 0.43) or vertebral chordoma (hazard ratio, 7.29; P = 0.23).
   CONCLUSION: Using data from d urge national cancer registry, we found that the available evidence is not enough to suggest that the addition of RT offers a survival benefit for patients with sacral and spinal chordoma after GTR. Given the non-negligible complications associated with RT, the balance of benefits and risks must be considered during preoperative tailoring of the treatment decisions.

AB OBJECTIVE: We compared the efficacy of a closed suction irrigation system (CSIS) and negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) for deep surgical site infection (SSI) after lumbar surgery with instrumentation.
   METHODS: We included 31 patients (NPWT group, n =16; CSIS group, n = 15) with deep SS's after lumbar surgery with instrumentation from 2007 to 2017. The medical records were reviewed and patient characteristics, laboratory results, infection details, and treatment interventions were recorded. The Japanese Orthopaedic Association score and Oswestry disability index were used to assess pain and functional outcomes preoperatively and 3 and 12 months postoperatively. The cost of SSIs were compared between the NPWT and CSIS groups.
   RESULTS: No significant differences were found in the baseline characteristic data between the NPWT and CSIS groups. Implants were retained in all patients in the CSIS group, but required removal from 2 patients with late infections in the NPWT group. The average hospital stay was 36.8 +/- 10.5 days and 33.4 +/- 18.9 days in the NPWT and CSIS groups, respectively. The cost was greater in the NPWT group than in the CSIS group. Both NPWT and CSIS significantly reduced the Oswestry disability index and improved the Japanese Orthopaedic Association scores, but no significant difference was found between the 2 groups.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results have shown that both NPWT and CSIS are efficient techniques for the management of deep SSI after lumbar surgery with instrumentation. CSIS was more economical and the NPWT system was portable and easier for postoperative nursing care.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Serum hyperglycemia and hypophosphatemia have been reported to be common in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). This study aimed to explore whether admission serum glucose-phosphate ratio was associated with the severity and prognosis of aSAH.
   METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 198 patients with aSAH who were admitted within 24 hours of hemorrhage to a single academic hospital from June 2016 to September 2017. The following determinations were recorded: aSAH severity on admission, assessment by the World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies grading scale (WFNS), Fisher score defined according to the computed tomography results, and 3-month outcome assessed by the Glasgow Outcome Scale. A statistical analysis of the clinical and laboratory risk factors of poor outcome was conducted.
   RESULTS: Admission serum glucose-phosphate ratio was increased in a WFNS grade-dependent manner and was higher in patients who had a poor outcome than in those who had a good outcome 3 months after aSAH. Multiple binomial logistic regression analysis showed that serum glucose-phosphate ratio, along with age, WFNS grade, and intraventricular hemorrhage, was associated with 3-month poor outcome after aSAH when we controlled for Fisher score, acute hydrocephalus, delayed cerebral ischemia, symptomatic cerebral vasospasm, serum glucose and phosphate levels, and glucose-potassium ratio. Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that the area under the curve for glucose-phosphate ratio was significantly higher than age and intraventricular hemorrhage.
   CONCLUSIONS: The study shows that the glucose-phosphate ratio is a potential biomarker that can reflect disease severity and prognosis in aSAH patients.

AB OBJECTIVE: We aimed to compare the clinical efficacy of titanium mesh cage with that of allogeneic bone graft to reconstruct the anterior column through posterior approach for the surgical management of patients with thoracolumbar spinal tuberculosis with kyphosis.
   METHODS: From January 2011 to March 2013, 57 patients with single-segment or two-segments thoracolumbar spinal tuberculosis with kyphosis were treated by debridement, interbody graft, posterior instrumentation, and fusion via a posterior-only procedure. Twenty-four patients in group A were treated with allogeneic bone graft to reconstruct the anterior column, whereas 33 patients in group B were treated with titanium mesh cage. The clinical efficacy was evaluated by visual analog scale WAS), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), neurologic function recovery, kyphotic Cobb angle, and postoperative complications.
   RESULTS: The mean follow-up was 72.4 months. Neurologic function was significantly improved after surgery in all cases. There were significant differences of VAS, ESR, and CRP between preoperation and postoperation at the final follow-up, with no significant difference between the two groups. The kyphotic Cobb correction was significantly improved when compared with those in preoperation, but there was no significant difference between the two groups. One patient in group A with two segments involved experienced graft fracture. He had anterior bone graft with titanium mesh cage.
   CONCLUSIONS: Minimum 5-year follow-up outcomes showed that one-stage posterior focus debridement, interbody graft using titanium mesh cages, posterior instrumentation, and fusion is an effective treatment for patients with thoracolumbar spinal tuberculosis accompanied by kyphosis. It may obtain better clinical efficacy than allogeneic bone graft for treating two-segments thoracolumbar spinal tuberculosis.

AB OBJECTIVE: To provide a quantitative assessment of clinical outcomes of anterior cervical surgery for patients with Hirayama disease.
   METHODS: Nineteen patients undergoing anterior cervical surgery were retrospectively collected, and preoperative and postoperative clinical and radiographic data were compared.
   RESULTS: All patients had a mean follow-up time of 72.5 +/- 30.6 months. Tremor in 6 of 14 patients and cold paralysis in 8 patients were resolved after operation. Grip strength of upper extremities was significantly improved (preoperative 15.67 +/- 2.74 kg vs. postoperative 19.82 +/- 2.89 kg, P < 0.001). Postoperative cervical lordosis was significantly increased to 6.41 +/- 4.39 mm from 2.70 +/- 4.61 mm (P < 0.001). The overall range of cervical flexed motion was significantly decreased (preoperative 33.10 degrees +/- 10.60 degrees vs. postoperative 13.55 degrees +/- 6.69 degrees, P < 0.001), with segmental range of C5-6 (preoperative 12.52 degrees +/- 7.13 degrees vs. postoperative 7.04 degrees +/- 3.75 degrees, P = 0.002) and C6-7 (preoperative 9.01 degrees +/- 5.01 degrees vs. postoperative 5.73 degrees +/- 2.74 degrees, P = 0.014) contributing significantly to the improvement. Postoperative angle mobility of C3-4 to C6-7 was significantly decreased (P < 0.001). Postoperative neutral magnetic resonance imaging showed the transverse area of spinal cord of C6 (P = 0.016) and C7 (P = 0.021) was significantly increased.
   CONCLUSIONS: Anterior cervical surgery can provide clinical efficacy and imaging improvement, including reduced range of cervical flexed motion and angle mobility of lower cervical spine and increased cervical lordosis and spinal cord area.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate effects of using a large-sized coil first on embolizing cerebral aneurysms compared with conventional coils.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-six patients with 51 saccular intracranial aneurysms who underwent embolization with a large-sized coil first were enrolled as the large-sized coil group. There were 33 female and 13 male patients with a mean age of 56.9 +/- 8.8 years. The treatment modality was coiling alone in 30 aneurysms and stent-assisted coiling in 21. Meanwhile, 50 patients with 53 intracranial aneurysms who were treated with conventional-sized coils were selected as the control conventional-sized coil group, including 36 female and 14 male patients with a mean age of 54.6 +/- 5.8 years. The treatment modality was coiling alone in 29 aneurysms and stent-assisted coiling in 24 aneurysms. The occlusion rate, percent packing volume, total coil number and length, and follow-up occlusion rate were compared between the 2 groups.
   RESULTS: Significantly (P < 0.001) decreased percent packing volume (19.54% +/- 6.44% vs. 27.39% +/- 5.68%), decreased coil number (2.98 +/- 1.09 vs. 6.38 +/- 1.65), and length (26.20 +/- 26.57 vs. 44.35 +/- 35.88 cm) were achieved in the large versus the conventional coil group. At angiographic follow-up of 8 months, only 1 aneurysm (2.2%) recurred in the large coil group compared with 5 aneurysms recurrent (11.1%) in the conventional coil group.
   CONCLUSIONS: The use of a large-sized coil as the first one for embolizing cerebral aneurysms may be a better embolization strategy because it achieves similar initial occlusion rates, decreased packing density, decreased coil numbers and lengths, and reduced recurrence prevalence at follow-up.

AB OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a risk-scoring model for predicting recurrent hypertensive cerebral hemorrhage (RHCH) occurring within 1 year after initial hypertensive cerebral hemorrhage and to facilitate preemptive clinical intervention for the prevention of secondary hemorrhage.
   METHODS: Patient gender, age, blood pressure, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, location of cerebral hemorrhage, surgery, past medical history, blood biochemical parameters, and Glasgow Outcome Scale score were analyzed using logistic regression analysis to determine independent predictors of RHCH. A risk-scoring model was constructed by assigning coefficients to each predictor and validating it in another independent cohort. The accuracy of the model was then assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and the calibration ability of the model was assessed by the Hosmer-Lemeshow test.
   RESULTS: Of 520 patients in the derivation cohort, 38 developed RHCH within 1 year after discharge. Independent risk factors of RHCH were age > 60 years; stage 3 hypertension at admission; GCS score 9-12 (admission); GCS score 3-8 (discharge); history of cerebral ischemic stroke, smoking, alcoholism; and plasma homocysteine (Hcy) level >= 10 mu mol/L. The recurrence rates for the low-risk (0-13 points), intermediate-risk (14-26 points), and high-risk (27-39 points) groups were 1.73%, 6.11%, and 57.14%, respectively (P < 0.001). The corresponding rates in the validation cohort, of whom 10/ 107 (9.35%) developed RHCH, were 3.45%, 7.14%, and 71.43%, respectively (P < 0.001). The risk-scoring model showed good discrimination in both the derivation and validation cohorts, with an AUC of 0.802 versus 0.863. The model also showed good calibration ability (the Hosmer-Lemeshow P values of the two cohorts were 0.532 vs. 0.724).
   CONCLUSIONS: This model will help identify high- risk groups for RHCH in order to facilitate and improve preemptive clinical intervention.

DE Adult idiopathic scoliosis; Ponte osteotomy; Posterior spine surgery;
   Severe spine deformity; Vertebral column resection
AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of posterior multiple-level asymmetrical Ponte osteotomies for rigid adult idiopathic scoliosis.
   METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted for adult patients with rigid idiopathic scoliosis (flexibility of main curve <25%) who underwent one-stage multiple-level asymmetrical Ponte osteotomies with a minimum of 2-year follow-up between February 2009 and November 2015. The demographic data and surgical issues were collected, and the improvement of clinical function scores and radiologic parameters were obtained after surgery and during the follow-up to assess deformity correction, spinal balance, and clinical outcome.
   RESULTS: A total of 49 patients were included (10 male and 39 female) in this study, with an average age of 26.53 years old. The average follow-up was 28.37 +/- 6.98 months. All the cases presented a significant improvement of the main curve and focal kyphosis from 85.62 +/- 19.80 degrees to 36.19 +/- 16.74 degrees and 53.98 +/- 26.80 degrees to 30.88 +/- 18.69 degrees, with a mean correction rate of 57.73% and 41.23%. The postoperative coronal and sagittal parameters were all significantly improved, except coronal balance. The mean operative time and blood loss were 267.86 +/- 54.49 minutes and 838.78 +/- 538.93 mL. All the clinical function scores of patients were significantly improved at the final follow-up. Only one patient had a complication related to surgical incision, with no neurologic complications occurring.
   CONCLUSIONS: he surgical procedure of multiple-level asymmetrical Ponte osteotomy is a safe and effective technique, with reduced operation time, blood loss, and complications, and may offer an appropriate option to address the problems of rigid adult idiopathic scoliosis.

AB BACKGROUND: The effect of intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (iMRI) on tumor control during endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery (TSS) for nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas (NFPAs) has not yet been completely characterized. The present study assessed the effect of the iMRI findings on gross total resection (GTR) and progression-free survival at a mean follow-up of 62 +/- 9.4 months.
   METHODS: Retrospective analyses were performed on the data from 133 consecutive patients with NFPA who had undergone endoscopic TSS with iMRI using a 1.5T scanner.
   RESULTS: Compared with the first and final iMRI scans, the GTR rate increased from 42.9% to 63.9%. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that a lower GTR rate was associated with a higher Knosp score (odds ratio [OR], 3.612; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.568-8.321; P = 0.003), an increased tumor volume (OR, 0.926; 95% CI, 0.866-0.991; P = 0.025), and a history of surgery (OR, 0.376; 95% CI, 0.155-0.917; P = 0.031). During follow-up, 8 tumors (9.4%) recurred, and 29 remnants (60.4%) regenerated. The recurrence and regeneration rates were 0.019 and 0.121 patient/year, respectively. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that the tumor recurrence rates were lower for patients who had undergone GTR (P < 0.01) compared with those who had not. Univariate Cox regression analysis suggested that the presence of tumor remnants (hazard ratio, 1.546; 95% CI, 1.071-2.232; P = 0.02) was the influencing factor associated with tumor progression.
   CONCLUSIONS: High-field iMRI can increase the GTR rate in endoscopic TSS for NPFAs. The increased GTR rate was associated with longer progression-free survival. Cavernous sinus invasion, tumor size, and surgical history were important predictors of GTR in patients with NFPA.

AB OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the globus pallidus internus (GPi) in dopamine and dopamine transporter metabolism and to explore the regulatory role of DBS on dopaminergic neurons in Tourette syndrome by constructing an autoimmune model.
   METHODS: Serum with high concentrations of antinuclear antibodies or phosphate-buffered saline solution was injected into the striatum of rats by a stereotactic technique and micropump. Then, electrodes were planted in the rats' globus pallidus internus. Concentrations of dopamine and dopamine transporter in the striatum were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunohistochemistry, and Western blot analysis after 7 days of high-frequency stimulation (130 Hz).
   RESULTS: The tic behavior score of rats in the Tourette syndrome group was higher than that of rats in the control group (P< 0.01). After high-frequency stimulation, the scores of the Tourette syndrome model group and the control group significantly decreased. The concentration of dopamine in the Tourette syndrome model group and the control group also significantly decreased after electric stimulation (P< 0.05). In addition, immunohistochemical analysis and Western blot test results showed that dopamine transporter in the Tourette syndrome model nonstimulation group was lower than in the Tourette syndrome model stimulation group, and that dopamine transporter in the control nonstimulation group was lower than in the control stimulation group (P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study show that the mechanism of DBS of the GPi in the treatment of Tourette syndrome involved monoamine neurotransmitters, especially the dopamine system, that affected the metabolism and transport of corresponding neurotransmitters, playing an important role in regulating the concentration of synaptic neurotransmitters and changing the biologic activity of basal ganglia nerve circuits.

TI Combined Administration of Poly-ADP-Ribose Polymerase-1 and Caspase-3
   Inhibitors Alleviates Neuronal Apoptosis After Spinal Cord Injury in

AB BACKGROUND: Neuronal apoptosis plays a pivotal role in spinal cord injury (SCI)-induced secondary cellular events. Caspase-dependent and -independent pathways are involved in neuronal apoptosis. Caspase-3 is the final effector of caspase-dependent apoptosis, whereas polyADP-ribose polymerase-1 (PARP-1) and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) are key executors of caspase-independent apoptosis. However, it remains unclear whether simultaneous inhibition of the 2 apoptosis pathways will be more beneficial for neuronal survival. Therefore, this study investigated the ability of coadministration of the PARP-1 inhibitor 3-aminobenzamide (3-AB) and caspase-3 inhibitor z-DEVD-fmk to attenuate apoptosis in a rat SCI model.
   METHODS: The rats were subjected to moderate contusive SCI. Locomotor function was measured using the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan rating scales; neuronal apoptosis was detected using transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate-biotin nick end labeling; and immunohistochemistry and Western blotting were used to measure protein expression.
   RESULTS: We found the locomotor function of rats was weakened within 7 days post-SCI. At day 7 post-SCI, neuronal apoptosis dramatically increased and the expression of PARP-1, AIF, and cleaved caspase-3 was significantly upregulated. Further, Bcl-2 expression was significantly downregulated. The highest locomotor function recovery was recorded after the combined administration of 3-AB and z-DEVD-fmk for 7 days post-SCI when compared with 3-AB or z-DEVD-fmk administered alone. In addition, this combination therapy significantly reduced neuronal apoptosis by preventing upregulation of PARP-1 and AIF, inhibiting caspase-3 activation, and elevating Bcl-2 expression.
   CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that combination therapy is beneficial for neuronal function recovery in rats with SCI. The underlying mechanism may be associated with cosuppression of caspase-dependent and caspase-independent apoptosis pathways.

AB BACKGROUND: Hydrocephalus is a common complication following decompressive craniectomy. Ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) is required for some patients before receiving a cranioplasty (CP). The presence of a VPS is regarded as a risk factor for overall CP complications.
   METHODS: A retrospective survey was conducted on 176 patients with traumatic brain injury who underwent late (>3 months) titanium CP (Ti-CP) in our hospital from April 2014 to July 2018. Thirteen patients (7.4%) had preoperative VPS. Propensity score matching was performed for these 13 patients with a ratio of 1:5. A total of 78 patients were selected. Preoperative clinical parameters and postoperative complications were analyzed. The period of postoperative follow-up ranged from 3 to 63 months (mean 21.3 +/- 17.0 months).
   RESULTS: The overall complication rate was greater in the VPS group (P = 0.010). These patients were more likely to develop a sunken skin flap (P < 0.001). The rate of postoperative cerebral hemorrhage was greater in the VPS group. Logistic analysis showed that preoperative VPS was an independent risk factor for postoperative extradural collection (odds ratio 17.714, P < 0.001). VPS was not related to postoperative infection and seizure. Post-operative drainage duration longer than 2.5 days significantly increased the risk of postoperative infection (odds ratio 7.715, P = 0.023).
   CONCLUSIONS: The presence of a VPS significantly increased the risk of extradural collection in patients with traumatic brain injury who underwent late Ti-CP. It also was related to postoperative hemorrhage. The sunken skin flap in patients with VPS increased surgical difficulty and the likelihood of extradural accumulation. Preoperative VPS was not related to postoperative infection and seizure in Ti-CP.

AB OBJECTIVE: Lymphocytic hypophysitis (LYH) is a rare autoimmune inflammatory disease of the pituitary gland. In this study, we aim to characterize LYH at presentation and focus on the management and prognosis of LYH.
   METHODS: A retrospective study of patients with LYH was conducted between 2011 and 2018 at a single institute. The patients were included by pathologic conformation and strict exclusion criteria. Clinical profile, imaging, and management data were collected.
   RESULTS: Twenty patients with LYH (16 women and 4 men) were included. Ten patients were diagnosed histologically and the remaining 10 patients were confirmed clinically of exclusion criteria. The median age at diagnosis was 37 years (range, 16-58 years). Presenting symptoms were followed by polyuria/polydipsia (11, 55%), vision changes (10, 50%), headache (8, 40%), menstrual irregularities and amenorrhea (4, 20%), diplopia (1, 5%), or sexual dysfunction (1, 5%). Eight patients had partial anterior pituitary hormone dysfunction. The thyroidstimulating hormone axis was most involved. Ten patients received transsphenoidal surgery, 5 patients experienced steroid pulse therapy, and observation was performed on 5 patients. Only 5 patients (25%) showed improvement of anterior pituitary dysfunction after initial management. Recovery of diabetes insipidus occurred in 2 patients (18%). The overall recurrence rate was 22.2%.
   CONCLUSIONS: Nonoperative treatment is a better option for most patients with LYH because it is effective and noninvasive. Surgery is recommended for definitive diagnosis, severe or rapid progression of neurologic impairment, and glucocorticoid insensitivity. Periodic follow-up is mandatory in a patient's long-term management.

AB We demonstrate by means of a simple thought experiment on lipid films dispersed over an air-water interface that a core refractive index of the system approaches root 2, a very significant value for the lipid (DPPC or DPPE) monolayers. The thought experiment consists of balancing two principal types of acting pressures: the vertical and the horizontal/lateral ones, both taken at a thermodynamic equilibrium. The horizontal pressure of (modified) van der Waals type comes from the minimalistic application of the (movable) lateral barrier, as can be expected to occur in Langmuir experiments, provided that the application of pressure is very weak. On the other hand, after relaxing the system when the barrier goes back, one expects to arrive at another scenario. This is when the vertical pressure of the air-water quasi-planar system of hydrophobic propensity applies, provided that an idealized assumption of the equally distributed pressurizing energy is true. This is in accord with a Kubo evaluation for a certain number of charged point-like objects immersed in water spherical shells and surrounded by air for which the Kelvin (J.J. Thomson) law prevails. At the horizontal vs. vertical pressure conditions one may uncover, by employing simple analytic means the basic dielectric and optical properties of the domain-wise, pairwise-interaction involving lipid film. It turns out that a simple Gladstone-Dale scenario, pointing to splitting the core refractive index into root 2 approximate to 1 + 0.41 overwhelms, with the fractional value of ca. 0.41 attributed to a molecular contribution of the charged lipid-water (dipolar) local system, affecting the overall pressure-addressing scenario. (By the value of refractive index centering at one, the vacuum conditions are to be addressed.) One may argue, however, that the fractional part of the refractive index seems to be a bit outside the contemporary experimental reach. On the other hand, it can be rationalized by the Casimir critical soft-matter fluctuational effect.

AB Single-component white-light phosphors for UV-LED chip excitation have attracted increasing interests due to its good color stability and high color rendering index (CRI) values in solid-state lighting and display applications. However, most of such materials are prepared in harsh conditions, such as requiring extremely high temperature calcination (> 1000 degrees C) and reductive atmosphere generally. To deal with this problem, we herein put forward a novel way to prepare the single-component white-light materials using Eu3+, Tb3+, and DPA (DPA = 2,6-Pyridinedicarboxylic acid) co-doped Laponite (R) through environmentally friendly preparation method (in aqueous solution) under mild reaction conditions (low calcination temperature 550 degrees C and air atmosphere), which exhibits a highly pure white light with good color quality (0.33, 0.34), moderate correlated color temperature value (CCT, 5544 K) and high color-rendering index value (CRI, 93).

AB The photoelectric response spectra were studied in a LiGaO2 crystal. The obtained spectra were interpreted as the release and diffusion of charge carriers, as well as external photoemission of electrons. The charge carrier release starts from excitation with a photon with energy greater than the optical gap of the LiGaO2 crystal (similar to 6 eV). The efficiency of generation of charge carriers exponentially increases up to 8 eV with saturation beginning from 9 eV. The nature of the photoelectric response is attributed to the Dember effect corresponding to the higher mobility of electrons compared to holes. The low yield of the internal photoelectron in the range of the intrinsic absorption band at 6 eV is associated with its exciton nature. Above 9.5-10 eV, an additional response was revealed that was interpreted as external photoelectron emission with a threshold of about E-th = 10.1 +/- 0.2 eV. The relative emission yield of electrons increases as (h nu - E-th)(3), which corresponds to indirect transitions between the valence and conduction bands. The emission of photoelectrons for the direct band-to-band transitions increases linearly with the photon energy and the corresponding threshold is defined as 12.7 +/- 0.2 eV.

We investigate the effect of C doping on the stability and electronic properties of the oxygen vacancies and the Ce4+ in Lu2SiO5. Stability of the C atom at the O site and the interstitial site depends on the O chemical potential. The C defects have strong interaction with nearby oxygen vacancies and Ce4+. Importantly, C doping can tune the amount of the oxygen vacancies and Ce4+ in Lu2SiO5. C doping introduces defect bands in the band gap of Lu2SiO5 with the energies ranging from 0.13 eV to 2.1 eV above the valence band maximum.

AB Herein, we have discussed change in dielectric and optical properties due to dispersion of Strontium hardystonite (Sr-HT) in the pure nematic liquid crystal (LC). The two different (0.5% wt./wt. and 1.0% wt./wt.) concentration of Sr-HT are dispersed in the pure nematic LC. After the dispersion of Sr-HT we have observed faster response and lower threshold voltage in comparison to pure nematic LC. The higher value of dielectric anisotropy calculated from the dielectric measurement and it has been suggested that lower voltage is required for switching of nematic molecules. The faster response and low threshold voltage will be very beneficial for application point of view used in making flat panel displays and lower power consumption devices. The UV absorbance and optical transmittance is reduced for Sr-HT dispersed nematogen. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra suggested the shifting in emission peak for Sr-HT dispersed nematogen due to different molecular interaction taking place between nematic LC and Sr-HT molecules. In addition to this Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) for pure and Sr-HT dispersed nematogen has also been done.

AB A novel tricyclic heterocyclic compound, 5,5'-(furan-2,5-diyl)bis (1,3,4- thiadiazol-2-amine) (3), was easily synthesized, which has an excellent fluorescence performance and could be a chemical sensor of Pd2+ at a very broad pH range. Fluorescence titration shows that the detection limit of Pd2+ is up to 1.07 x 10(-9) M with a good accuracy. Density function theory (Guassian 09) indicates that the coordination of Pd2+ decreases the coplanarity and conjugation of compound 3, resulting in a fluorescence quenching. Generally, compound 3 could be practically applied in the convenient detection of Pd2+ with high sensitivity, excellent selectivity, good accuracy, and short response time. Compound 3 was characterized by NMR, MS, FT-IR, UV-Vis, H-1 NMR, C-13 NMR, and HRMS.

AB Four enantiopure imines in solid state with different functional groups added in the para-position of the aromatic ring in the chiral moiety were analysed. The molecular packing was investigated with the aim of correlating this fact with the surface morphology, structural and optical changes of these imines. By applying Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) the morphology showed dense plates and smooth surface. X-ray diffraction studies exhibited a Monoclinic -> Orthorhombic variation. The absorbance of these organic materials showed absorption bands associated with the pi ->pi(star) and n ->pi(star) electronic transitions located in the UV-region, typical of organic molecules. By applying the Tauc model, the band gap energy was quantified. An electronic transition located at similar to 2.5 eV and another well-defined band situated at similar to 3.3 eV can be observed. Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy performed at room temperature with the 450 nm laser line showed green, yellow and red emission bands located in the similar to 450-700 nm range of the Vis-region with different intensities. The experimental results indicated that the photoluminescence properties of the crystals strongly depend on molecular stacking in the crystal arrays and this optical behavior can be associated with different crystalline effects. The Raman spectra was examined to identify the vibrational modes in a qualitative way and the experimental results were confirmed with the reported values obtained through theoretical-experimental models.

AB Luminescent temperature sensors operated at wide temperature interval show promising technological potential. Here, the holmium and ytterbium co-doping of cubic phase Sc2O3:x%Ho3+/8%Yb3+ (x = 1.0-3.0) nanocrystals are synthesized by a facile coprecipitation annealing method. The strongest green and red up-conversion emission was obtained from Sc2O3:2%Ho3+/8%Yb3+ with 980 nm excitation. The temperature sensitivity steadily increases to 0.1285 K-1 at similar to 83 K during cooling. Accordingly, the ratio of green and red up-conversion emission increases from 0.966 to 3.469 when cooling from 483 K to 83 K. This is in accordance with the changing of cross-relaxation process at different temperatures. This work highlights the fascinating potential of lanthanide-loped Sc2O3 for highly sensitive wide temperature monitoring.

AB In this present work, influence of Eu3+ ions concentration in a novel alkaline earth oxyfluoro-borotellurite glasses were synthesized with the composition (40 - x)B2O3 + 20TeO(2) + 10BaO + 10BaF(2) + 10SrO + 10SrF(2) + xEu(2)O(3) (where x = 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2 and 3 in wt%) to explore the applications of laser and LEDs. Spectroscopic properties of the titled glasses have been examined through UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectra, fluorescence and decay measurements. The effective shift in the absorption band positions in the absorption spectra has been used as a tool to explore the bonding nature of Eu3+ ions with the host matrix and the obtained results suggests the presence of covalent nature of the Eu3+-ligand bonds in the glass network. Luminescence spectra of the present glasses have been characterized and the radiative properties of the emission bands were analyzed through Judd-Ofelt (JO) theory. The CIE 1931 color chromaticity diagram is used to discover the overall emission spectral features such as characteristic emission color, correlated color temperature and color purity of the prepared glasses. Luminescence decay curves of the present glasses exhibit single exponential profile for all the titled glasses and the experimental lifetime values were compared with the theoretical decay lifetime values obtained after analyzing the necessary curve fitting.

AB We investigated various characteristics of chlorinated indium tin oxide (Cl-ITO) for highly efficient organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs): the work function, surface morphology, wetting characteristic, and hole-injection property. Via the systematic analysis of Cl-ITO, we showed that the modification of ITO using the plasma treatment method has a simple process and offers higher stability than that achieved with a solution-based modification method. We fabricated Cl-ITO with a high work function of 6.04 eV, which is 1.04 eV higher than that of pristine ITO. We verified that Cl-2 plasma treatment does not affect the ITO surface morphology. The Cl halogenated surface showed a low surface polarity and influenced the growth of the organic material, especially for films as thin as similar to 4 nm. Therefore, we found when using ultra-thin film on Cl-ITO for design devices, the wetting characteristic of Cl-ITO should be considered. In addition, using tris-(4-carbazoyl-9-ylphenyl)-amine resulted in increased current and power efficiencies compared with those obtained using 4,4'-N,N'-dicarbazolebiphenyl. When a carrier-only device was used, the carrier-injection characteristics of Cl-ITO were higher than those of other well-known hole-injection materials. Furthermore, the Cl-ITO OLEDs showed higher stability than OLEDs with other hole-injection materials.

AB Self-assembly of metal oxide nanoparticles into two dimensional nanostructures has emerged as a promising strategy to fabricate efficient catalysts and photocatalysts for purification of water. Nanosheets of CuO were prepared using a simple wet chemical route using polyvinyl alcohol as a capping agent and investigated as catalysts for reducing 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) into 4-aminophenol (4-AP) and as photocatalysts for removal of methylene blue (MB) and methyl orange (MO) from water. Field emission scanning electron microscopy studies revealed nanosheets, which were found to be of monoclinic CuO from X-ray diffraction studies. The optical, catalytic and photocatalytic studies of the prepared CuO nanostructures were carried out by UV-visible absorption spectroscopy. The synthesized CuO nanosheets led to complete catalytic conversion of harmful 4-NP into very useful 4-AP by borohydride in just 5 min and photocatalytically degraded MB and MO in 160 and 180 min, respectively. The roles of active species in the photocatalytic process have been studied using different scavengers and the tentative mechanisms underlying the growth, photocatalytic and enhanced catalytic activities of CuO nanosheets were proposed.

AB Studies of nanocomposites produced by the association of quantum dots (QDs) and polymers, in general, use the nanocrystals as the energy's donor and the polymer's molecules as acceptors. The production of nanocomposites in which a water-soluble polymer is the energy donor species and the quantum dots the acceptors species is particularly difficult due to low luminescence quantum yield and low fluorescence lifetimes of these molecules when compared to the QDs. In this work, we associated colloidal CdTe QDs stabilized with thioglycolic acid (TGA) with water-soluble semiconductor luminescent polymer Poly{[2,5-bis(2-(N,N-diethylamino)ethoxy)-1,4-phenylene]-alt-1,4-phenylene} (PPE-DBE) to produce nanocomposites that favors the polymers as donors and QDs as acceptors. We characterized the composites by absorption, static fluorescence, and dynamic fluorescence. Our results showed the intensification of the QDs emission and its quantum yield on the nanocomposite and the decrease of the polymer lifetime. Thus, we verified the occurrence of energy transfer from the polymer to the quantum dots, especially for samples which the ratio of PPP-DBE monomers per number of QDs in solution is approximately 465, achieving an increase of 11.34% on the QDs' fluorescence quantum yield.

AB Li2Gd4(MoO4)(7): Eu3+/PMMA composite flakes (LGMP: Eu3+) have been obtained via embedding Eu3+-activated LGM polycrystalline precursor powders into polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA). The precursor powder with a size of similar to 7 mu m is confirmed to form the sea-island-like structure by SEM, which is helpful to the stability of the particle-polymer coexistence network in LGMP: Eu3+ flakes. Differential photon-generating behaviors are revealed under short-wave radiation and the effectiveness of PMMA is verified in reducing the mutual collision probability and avoiding the powder agglomeration. Although the LGMP: Eu3+ system has lower powder content in contrast to the pure precursor, its luminosity is still comparable to the pure one due to its favorable particle dispersibility. Efficient photon-conversion and intense red-emission indicate the organic-inorganic composite of PMMA loaded LGM: Eu3+ system is a potential candidate for solid-state lighting and color displays.

AB A series of D-pi-A type organic dyes with bulky triphenylmethyl moiety containing 2,6-bis-(4-substituted)styryl-4H-pyran-4-ylidene donor (D) fragments and different electron acceptors (A) were synthesized and investigated, mostly for potential applications in organic solid-state lasers as infra-red (IR) radiation amplification medium. Dye glass transition temperature is above 99 degrees C with thermal stability in the region from 173 degrees C to 326 degrees C which was slightly influenced by the electron acceptor fragment attached to the 4H-pyrane ring in 4-position. Introducing substituents in 4-position within one of the styryl-fragments with stronger electron withdrawing properties decreased ASE excitation threshold values (E-th) up to 180 mu J/cm(2) in dye spin-cast neat films and shifted photoluminescence and amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) processes into the infra-red (IR) region. Although more studies are required, some of the investigated non-symmetric bis-styryl-DWK-dyes show potential as a solution-processable gain medium for IR radiation amplification.

AB Spectroscopic ellipsometry is applied to investigate the effect of Cu/Zn disorder in a Cu2ZnSnSe4 crystal on the optical transitions. We observe that the degree of order has an impact not only on the first optical transition E-0 at the gamma point, which is the commonly discussed direct band gap in kesterites. It also varies the further optical transition E-1 away from the gamma point. While E-0 shows an increasing trend with higher degree of order, the transition E-1 shows an opposite behavior, indicating a fundamental impact of disorder on the shape of the electronic bands of kesterite material.

AB The thickness of interfacial layer of semitransparent nanostructured plasmonic copper thin films fabricated on the glass substrate via pulsed laser deposition, as a function of deposition time, using spectroscopic ellipsometry is reported. The top oxide layer was identified as Cu2O having the thickness in the range of 2.47 nm-3.29 nm. The phase of interfacial layer is found to be changing from cupric oxide to cuprous oxide with the increase in deposition time and the thickness was found to increase from 0.25 to 0.61 nm for the deposition time of 6-10 min respectively. Longitudinal and transverse SPR modes were identified from SE measurements and were found to be in agreement with that of measured directly via UV-Visible spectrometer. The band gap energy of the top Cu2O layer was observed to be similar to 2.02 eV.

AB Focused Ion Beam Scanning Electron Microscopy (FIB-SEM) is an imaging approach that enables analysis of the 3D architecture of cells and tissues at resolutions that are 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than that possible with light microscopy. The slow speeds of data collection and manual segmentation are two critical problems that limit the more extensive use of FIB-SEM technology. Here, we present an easily accessible robust method that enables rapid, large-scale acquisition of data from tissue specimens, combined with an approach for semi-automated data segmentation using the open-source machine learning Weka segmentation software, which dramatically increases the speed of image analysis. We demonstrate the feasibility of these methods through the 3D analysis of human muscle tissue by showing that our process results in an improvement in speed of up to three orders of magnitude as compared to manual approaches for data segmentation. All programs and scripts we use are open source and are immediately available for use by others.

ID ULTRASTRUCTURE; INCLUSIONS; PARTICLES; FISH
AB Guanine crystals are used by certain animals, including vertebrates, to produce structural colors or to enhance vision, because of their distinctive reflective properties. Here we use cryo-SEM, cryo-FIB SEM and Raman spectroscopic imaging to characterize crystalline inclusions in a single celled photosynthesizing marine dinoflagellate species. We demonstrate spectroscopically that these inclusions are blocky crystals of anhydrous guanine in the beta-polymorph. Two-dimensional cryo-SEM and three-dimensional cryo-FIB-SEM serial block face imaging show that the deposits of anhydrous guanine crystals are closely associated with the chloroplasts. We suggest that the crystalline deposits scatter light either to enhance light exploitation by the chloroplasts, or possibly for protection from UV radiation. This is consistent with the crystal locations within the cell, their shapes and their sizes. As the dinoflagellates are extremely abundant in the oceans and are a major group of photosynthesizing marine organisms, the presence of guanine crystals in this marine organism may have broad significance.

AB The birds and reptiles, collectively known as the sauropsids, can be subdivided phylogenetically into the archosaurs (birds, crocodiles), the testudines (turtles), the squamates (lizards, snakes) and the rhynchocephalia (tuatara). The structural framework of the epidermal appendages from the sauropsids, which include feathers, claws and scales, has previously been characterised by electron microscopy, infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction analyses, as well as by studies of the amino acid sequences of the constituent beta-keratin proteins (also referred to as the corneous beta-proteins). An important omission in this work, however, was the lack of sequence and structural data relating to the epidermal appendages of the rhynchocephalia (tuatara), one of the two branches of the lepidosaurs. Considerable effort has gone into sequencing the tuatara genome and while this is not yet complete, there are now sufficient sequence data for conclusions to be drawn on the similarity of the beta-keratins from the tuatara to those of other members of the sauropsids. These results, together with a comparison of the X-ray diffraction pattern of tuatara claw with those from seagull feather and goanna claw, confirm that there is a common structural plan in the beta-keratins of all of the sauropsids, and not just those that comprise the archosaurs (birds and crocodiles), the testudines (turtles) and the squamates (lizards and snakes).

The structural complexity of LRDs mainly depends on the catalytic activity of class I DTSs, which catalyze the formation of bicyclic to pentacyclic LRDs, using as a substrate the catalytic product of class II DTSs. To date, the structural and mechanistic details for the biosynthesis of bicyclic LRDs skeletons catalyzed by class I DTSs remain unclear. This work presents the first X-ray crystal structure of an (E)-biformene synthase, LrdC, from the soil bacterium Streptomyces sp. strain K155. LrdC was identified as a part of an LRD cluster of five genes and was found to be a class I DTS that catalyzes the Mg2+-dependent synthesis of bicyclic LRD (E)-biformene by the dephosphorylation and rearrangement of normal copalyl pyrophosphate (CPP). Structural analysis of LrdC coupled with docking studies suggests that Phe189 prevents cyclization beyond the bicyclic LRD product through a strong stabilization of the allylic carbocation intermediate, while Tyr317 functions as a general base catalyst to deprotonate the CPP substrate. Structural comparisons of LrdC with homology models of bacterial bicyclic LRD-forming enzymes (CldD, RmnD and SclSS), as well as with the crystallographic structure of bacterial tetracyclic LRD ent-kaurene synthase (BjKS), provide further structural insights into the biosynthesis of bacterial LRD natural products.

AB A new cryo-EM system has been investigated for single particle analysis of protein structures. The system provides parallel illumination of a highly-coherent 300 kV electron beam from a cold-field emission gun, and boosts image contrast with an in-column energy filter and a hole-free phase plate. It includes motorized cryo-sample loading and automated liquid-nitrogen filling for cooling multiple samples. In this study, we describe gun and electron beam characteristics, and demonstrate the suitability of this system for single particle reconstructions. The performance of the system is tested on two examples, a spherical virus and apoferritin. GUI programs have also been developed to control and monitor the system for correct illumination, imaging with less ellipticity and steady magnification, and timing of flashing and liquid-nitrogen filling. These programs are especially useful for efficient application of the system to single particle cryo-EM.

AB Recent advances in instrumentation and software for cryoEM have increased the applicability and utility of this method. High levels of automation and faster data acquisition rates require hard decisions to be made regarding data retention. Here we investigate the efficacy of data compression applied to aligned summed movie files. Surprisingly, these images can be compressed using a standard lossy method that reduces file storage by 90-95% and yet can still be processed to provide sub-2 angstrom reconstructed maps. We do not advocate this as an archival method, but it may provide a useful means for retaining images as an historical record, especially at large facilities.

AB Osteosarcoma is the most common primary bone cancer type in humans. It is predominantly found in young individuals, with a second peak later in life. The tumour is formed by malignant osteoblasts and consists of collagenous, sometimes also mineralized, bone matrix. While the morphology of osteosarcoma has been well studied, there is virtually no information about the nanostructure of the tumour and changes in mineralization on the nanoscale level. In the present paper, human bone tissue inside, next to and remote from a sclerosing osteosarcoma was studied with small angle x-ray scattering, x-ray diffraction and electron microscopy. Quantitative evaluation of nanostructure parameters was combined with high resolution, large area mapping to obtain microscopic images with nanostructure parameter contrast. It was found that the tumour regions were characterized by a notable reduction in mineral particle size, while the mineral content was even higher than that in normal bone. Furthermore, the normal preferential orientation of mineral particles along the longitudinal direction of corticalis or trabeculae was largely suppressed. Also the bone mineral crystal structure was affected: severe crystal lattice distortions were detected in mineralized tumour tissue pointing to a different ion substitution of hydroxyl apatite in tumorous tissue than in healthy tissue.

ID PROTEIN; FILAMENTS
AB Septins are GTP-binding proteins that will often spontaneously assemble into filaments. In some species, particularly budding yeast, it is well known that these are capable of associating with membranes in order to fulfill their cellular role as a component of the cytoskeleton. Different from other human septins, SEPT7 appears to be unique in that it is an essential component of all hetero-oligomeric complexes described to date. As a step towards understanding the molecular basis of filament assembly, here we present two high-resolution structures of the SEPT7 GTPase domain complexed with GDP. One of these reveals a previously unreported coordination for the magnesium ion involving four water molecules and only a tenuous connection to the protein. The higher resolution structures provide unambiguous insight into the interactions at the G-interface where a structural motif based on an antiparallel beta-bridge allows for the rationalization of why some septins show nucleotide-dependent beta-strand slippage and others do not.

AB For some Gram-positive genera and species, the long-extended and adhesive sortase-dependent pilus plays an essential role during host colonization, biofilm formation, and immune modulation. Lactobacillus rhounnosus GG is a gut-adapted commensal strain that harbors the operonic genes for the SpaCBA and SpaFED pili, both being comprised of three different protein subunits termed the backbone, tip, and basal pilins. Crystal structures of the backbone pilins (SpaA and SpaD) have recently been solved, and here we describe the high-resolution (1.5 angstrom) structural determination of the SpaE basal pilin. SpaE consists of two immunoglobulin-like CnaB domains, with each displaying a spontaneously formed internal isopeptide bond, though apparently slow forming in the N-terminal domain. Remarkably, SpaE contains an atypically lengthy unstructured C-terminal tail, along with an YPKN pilin motif peptide, which is normally reserved for backbone subunits. Based on our analysis of the crystal structure data, we provide a molecular model for the basal positioning of the SpaE pilin within the SpaFED pilus.

AB Phosphoketolases (PK) are TPP-dependent enzymes which play essential roles in carbohydrate metabolism of numerous bacteria. Depending on the substrate specificity PKs can be subdivided into xylulose 5-phosphate (X5P) specific PKs (XPKs) and PKs which accept both X5P and fructose 6-phosphate (F6P) (XFPKs). Despite their key metabolic importance, so far only the crystal structures of two XFPKs have been reported. There are no reported structures for any XPKs and for any complexes between PK and substrate. One of the major unknowns concerning PKs mechanism of action is related to the structural determinants of PKs substrate specificity for X5P or F6P. We report here the crystal structure of XPK from Lactococcus lactis (XPK-LO at 2.1 angstrom resolution. Using small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) we proved that XPK-Ll is a dieter in solution. Towards better understanding of PKs substrate specificity, we performed flexible docking of TPP-X5P and TPP-F6P on crystal structures of XPK-Ll, two XFPKs and transketolase (TK). Calculated structure-based binding energies consistently support XPK-Ll preference for X5P. Analysis of structural models thus obtained show that substrates adopt moderately different conformation in PKs active sites following distinct networks of polar interactions. Based on the here reported structure of XPK-Ll we propose the most probable amino acid residues involved in the catalytic steps of reaction mechanism. Altogether our results suggest that Pits substrate preference for X5P or F6P is the outcome of a fine balance between specific binding network and dissimilar catalytic residues depending on the enzyme (XPK or XFPK) - substrate (X5P or F6P) couples.

AB Objective: To determine whether the main reason for bedtime is associated with sleep and adaptive functioning in adolescents.
   Methods: Participants were 1374 adolescents (X age = 16.8 years, SD = 0.58; 33.6% male) from Helsinki, Finland. Adolescents completed a questionnaire battery including the Munich Chronotype Questionnaire, Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, Beck Depression Inventory, and items drawn from the School Sleep Habits Survey, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index.
   Results: On school nights, adolescents whose parents set their bedtime, and those who went to bed when they were tired went to bed earlier, obtained more sleep and had earlier midpoint of sleep than adolescents who went to bed when they have finished messaging/ socializing or when their television show had finished. Adolescents who went to bed when they had finished their homework had sleep that fell in between these groups. On weekends, adolescents whose parents set their bedtime went to bed earlier and had an earlier midpoint of sleep. However, there were no differences between groups in terms of sleep duration once the need to rise for school in the morning was removed. Adolescents who went to bed on school nights when they were tired or once their homework was finished had better adaptive functioning.
   Conclusions: These results provide support for two very different approaches to help optimize the sleep of adolescents: either by implementing parental regulation of bedtimes across adolescence, or by encouraging adolescents to use their bodily cues to indicate when it is time for bed, rather than relying on an external cue.

AB Background: Sleep-disordered breathing may precipitate angina pectoris (AP) in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether REM sleep is associated with the incidence of AP in different categories of apnea-hypopnea index (AHI).
   Methods: A total of 2710 participants from Sleep Heart Health Study (59.3% women; mean age 61.7 years), who had 6-8 h of sleep; experienced an almost 11-year follow-up period. Complete polysomnography data and medical records were available for all participants. Percentage of REM sleep time (REM%) was classified into grade 1 (< 20%), grade 2 (20e25%) and grade 3 (> 25%). Logistic regression analysis was used to characterize the independent association between REM sleep and prevalent AP in this multi-center community-based cohort study.
   Results: Patients with REM% of grade 3 had a higher incidence of AP than those with grade 1 and grade 2 (50.3% vs 42.4% vs 42.1%, respectively; p = 0.003). After adjusting for age, gender, race, AHI, marital status, education level, body mass index, sleep duration, arousal index, diabetes, hypertension and smoking status, multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that REM% > 25% was independently associated with the occurrence of AP (odds ratio = 1.500; 95% confidence interval = 1.188-1.894; p = 0.001).
   Conclusions: The percentage of REM sleep time may affect the incidence of AP irrespective of AHI level. Therefore, the relationship between sleep structure and cardiovascular disease merits further exploration. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: The clinical spectrum of restless legs syndrome (RLS) has not been described in a Chinese population. We aim to evaluate the detailed clinical profile in a cohort of unselected RLS patients in China.
   Methods: We enrolled RLS patients continuously according to the diagnostic criteria. Laboratory examinations were performed to exclude mimics and notable comorbidities.
   Results: A total of 359 patients with RLS were enrolled. RLS symptoms were mostly symmetrical (65.2%), and purely unilateral RLS was not common (5.6%); however, unilateral dominant RLS was relatively more common. Only 1.1% of RLS patients reported no unpleasant sensations in the legs. The largest proportion of RLS patients described their uncomfortable sensation as indescribable (43.5%) and reported soreness (40.4%). In all, 8.9% of RLS patients described their abnormal sensation as painful, and 34.5% of RLS patients reported their symptoms fluctuated with seasonal trends. This population had a higher likelihood of an RLS family history. RLS patients with summer exacerbation had a younger age at RLS onset and longer disease duration (p < 0.01). Iron deficiency without anemia was common in Chinese RLS patients. Early-onset RLS patients were more likely to have a positive family history (p < 0.01), more summer worsening of symptoms (p < 0.01) and more severely disturbed peripheral iron status (p < 0.01) when compared to late-onset RLS patients.
   Conclusion: The subjective description is somewhat different, with Chinese RLS patients reporting less pain and more soreness than patients from Western countries. Seasonal fluctuation and iron deficiency without anemia are frequently seen in Chinese RLS patients and predict some other features. Differentiating these various subtypes can facilitate optimal management. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Rationale: Sleep duration is critical to growth, learning, and immune function development in infancy. Strategies to ensure that national recommendations for sleep duration in infants are met require knowledge of perinatal factors that affect infant sleep.
   Objectives: To investigate the mechanistic pathways linking maternal education and infant sleep.
   Methods: An observational study was conducted on 619 infants whose mothers were enrolled at the Edmonton site of the CHILD birth cohort. Infant sleep duration at three months was assessed using the Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire. Maternal education was collected via maternal report. Prenatal and postnatal depression scores were obtained from the 20-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). Birth records and maternal report were the source of covariate measures. Mediation analysis (PROCESS v3.0) was used to examine the indirect effects of maternal education on infant sleep duration mediated through prenatal depression and birth mode.
   Measurements and main results: At three months of age, infants slept on average 14.1 h. Lower maternal education and prenatal depression were associated with significantly shorter infant sleep duration. Emergency cesarean section birth was associated with 1-hour shorter sleep duration at three months compared to vaginal birth [without intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis] (beta -0.99 h; 95% CI: -1.51, -0.48). Thirty percent of the effect of lower maternal education on infant total sleep duration was mediated sequentially through prenatal depression and birth mode (Total Indirect Effects: -0.12, 95% CI: -0.22, -0.03, p < 0.05).
   Conclusions: Prenatal depression and birth mode sequentially mediate the effect of maternal education on infant sleep duration. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective/Background: In the months after childbirth, women are vulnerable to sleep disturbances and sleep-related deficits in functioning, such as fatigue, daytime sleepiness, and attentional lapses. Currently there is limited evidence that these deficits are modifiable. Using both self-report and objective measures, this study examined changes in sleep-related daytime functioning among women attending a residential early parenting program for assistance with unsettled infant behavior and mild to moderate postpartum distress.
   Methods: Participants were 78 women (age M = 34.16, SD = 4.16 years) attending a five-day program with their infants (age M = 8.67, SD = 4.82 months). Sleep was assessed via self-report. Sleep-related daytime functioning was operationalized as fatigue, sleepiness, and sustained attention, and measured using validated questionnaires (all women) and the 10-min visual Psychomotor Vigilance Test (PVT; subgroup of 47 women). All measures were administered on both admission (baseline) and discharge.
   Results: On admission, participants reported elevated sleep disturbance (94%), fatigue (91%), as well as trait (54%) and state (67%) sleepiness. From admission to discharge, there were medium effect size reductions in fatigue and sleepiness, and large effect size improvements in sleep quality related domains such as increased sleep efficiency and reduced nighttime awakenings (all p < 0.001); changes in total sleep time were nonsignificant (p = 0.22). PVT reciprocal mean reaction times were also significantly faster (p = 0.001; medium effect size).
   Conclusions: This study demonstrated that among women attending a brief residential early parenting program, fatigue, daytime sleepiness, and objectively measured psychomotor vigilance can be improved. Implications for further research and potential treatments are discussed. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Sleep and circadian disruptions are frequently observed in patients across hospital wards. This is alarming, since impaired nocturnal sleep and disruption of a normal circadian rhythm can compromise health and disturb processes involved in recovery from illness (eg, immune functions). With this in mind, the present narrative review discusses how patient characteristics (sleep disorders, anxiety, stress, chronotype, and disease), hospital routines (pain management, timing of medication, nocturnal vital sign monitoring, and physical inactivity), and hospital environment (light and noise) may all contribute to sleep disturbances and circadian misalignment in patients. We also propose hospital-based strategies that may help reduce sleep and circadian disruptions in patients admitted to the hospital. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Objective/Background: The Clinical Global Impression scale (CGI) reflects the clinician's assessment of the disease impact on patient's global functioning. We assessed predictors of CGI scale rating in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).
   Patients/Methods: Consecutive patients with suspected OSA (n = 7581) were identified in the European Sleep Apnea Database (ESADA). Anthropometrics, comorbidities, apnea severity obtained by polygraphy or polysomnography, and daytime sleepiness [Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)] were assessed. The CGI 7-point scale was completed at the end of the diagnostic process (CGI-severity, ie, CGI-S) and, in a sub-population, at treatment follow-up (CGI-Improvement).
   Results: CGI-S was rated mild to moderate in 44% of patients. CGI rating at any given apnea intensity was worse in women than in men (p < 0.01). Patients undergoing polygraphy (n = 5075) were more frequently rated as severely ill compared to those studied with polysomnography (19.0% vs 13.0%, p < 0.001). In patients aged <= 65 years, CGI scoring was generally better than in the elderly despite a similar degree of OSA (eg, 'normal, not ill' 24.2% vs 15.3%, p < 0.01, respectively). Independent predictors of CGI rating included age, BMI, AHI, ESS, cardio-metabolic comorbidities, and diagnosis based on polygraphy. CGI-improvement rating (Beta = -0.406, p < 0.01) was superior to sleep apnea severity or ESS-score (Beta = 0.052 and -0.021, p = 0.154 and 0.538 respectively) at baseline for prediction of good CPAP compliance at follow-up.
   Conclusions: CGI rating is confounded by gender, age class and the type of sleep diagnostic method. As OSA phenotypes differ, CGI may contribute as a clinical tool to reflect the significance of clinical disease. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction: Most adults with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) report persistent sleep-wake disturbances. Whether these complaints are either associated with abnormal sleep-wake patterns or can be explained by TBI-related characteristics is unclear. The present study aimed at characterising the subjective and objective sleep-wake patterns in TBI adults by taking into consideration the influence of TBI severity, common comorbidities and psychoactive medication.
   Methods: Overall, 34 adults with moderate-severe TBI (one to four years post-injury) were compared to 34 controls. Sleepiness, fatigue, sleep quality, mood, and pain were assessed with questionnaires. A seven day sleep diary and actigraphy was used to document sleep and wake patterns.
   Results: Compared to controls, TBI participants reported more sleepiness and fatigue, as well as poorer sleep quality. On actigraphy, they had earlier bedtime and longer time spent in bed, but equivalent sleep efficiency during the nighttime episode compared to controls. TBI participants also took more naps and accumulated more time asleep over the 24 h period than controls. These group differences were accentuated when only TBI adults using psychoactive medication were included. More comorbidities, more severe injuries and longer hospital stay were positively correlated with fatigue, sleepiness and sleep duration.
   Conclusions: Our results showed that despite complaints regarding sleep and diurnal functioning, TBI survivors have very marginal changes in their objective sleep-wake schedules. Prolonged time spent in bed may reflect an attempt to increase their sleep duration in response to fatigue and sleepiness. TBI adults who use psychoactive medication are those with more evident changes in their sleep-wake schedules. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Indigenous populations continue to be among the world's most marginalized population groups. Studies in Indigenous populations from high income countries (including the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand) indicate increased risk of sleep disorders compared to non-Indigenous populations. Poor sleep, whether it be short sleep duration or fragmented sleep, is a well-established risk factor for cardio-metabolic diseases. Given the implications, targeted improvement of poor sleep may be beneficial for the health and well-being of Indigenous people. In this narrative review, we will: (1) discuss the effects of sleep on the cardio-metabolic processes; (2) examine sleep in Indigenous populations; (3) review the association between sleep and cardio-metabolic risk in Indigenous populations; and (4) review the potential role of sleep in cardiovascular disease risk detection and interventions to improve sleep and cardio-metabolic health in Indigenous people. In particular, this review highlights that the assessment of sleep quality and quantity may be a beneficial step toward identifying Indigenous people at risk of cardio-metabolic diseases and may represent a key intervention target to improve cardio-metabolic outcomes.

TI Sleep apnea screening is uncommon after stroke
SO SLEEP MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
DE Sleep apnea; Cerebrovascular disease/stroke
ID ISCHEMIC-STROKE; RISK; AMERICAN
AB Objective/Background: To assess (1) pre and post-stroke screening for sleep apnea (SA) within a population-based study without an academic medical center, and (2) ethnic differences in post-stroke sleep apnea screening among Mexican Americans (MAs) and non-Hispanic whites (NHWs).
   Patients/Methods: MAs and NHWs with stroke in the Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi project (2011-2015) were interviewed shortly after stroke about the pre-stroke period, and again at approximately 90 days after stroke in reference to the post-stroke period. Questions included whether any clinical provider directly asked about snoring or daytime sleepiness or had offered polysomnography. Logistic regression tested the association between these outcomes and ethnicity both unadjusted and adjusted for potential confounders.
   Results: Among 981 participants, 63% were MA. MAs in comparison to NHWs were younger, had a higher prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, and never smoking, a higher body mass index, and a lower prevalence of atrial fibrillation. Only 17% reported having been offered SA diagnostic testing pre-stroke, without a difference by ethnicity. In the post-stroke period, only 50 (5%) participants reported being directly queried about snoring; 86 (9%) reported being directly queried about sleepiness; and 55 (6%) reported having been offered polysomnography. No ethnic differences were found for these three outcomes, in unadjusted or adjusted analyses.
   Conclusions: Screening for classic symptoms of SA, and formal testing for SA, are rare within the first 90 days after stroke, for both MAs and NHWs. Provider education is needed to raise awareness that SA affects most patients after stroke and is associated with poor outcomes. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This study aimed to develop a novel patient-reported outcome (PRO) measure, the Nocturia Sleep Quality Scale (NSQS), for the assessment of the impact of nocturia (defined as >= 2 nocturnal voids/night) on sleep.
   Methods: Sleep-related concepts were identified through a targeted literature review, after which in-depth concept elicitation interviews with patients with a clinical diagnosis of nocturia were conducted. Draft items were generated to address concepts identified as important, meaningful, and relevant. Items were further refined through three iterative sets of cognitive debriefing interviews to optimize instructions, question wording, and response options. Two sleep research experts also provided input.
   Results: The literature review and data from 18 concept elicitation interviews provided the basis for a comprehensive set of concepts. Constant comparative analysis was used to identify themes and support item development. The draft questionnaire consisted of 14 items with item-specific response scales. Wording and scaling of the items was optimized based on feedback from the 22 cognitive debriefing interviews and expert input. The results confirmed the completeness and relevance of the NSQS, providing support for the content validity and ability of items to reflect patient perception of nocturiarelated sleep impacts.
   Conclusions: The 6-item NSQS assesses the impact of nocturia on sleep by evaluating nighttime awakenings, sleep quantity, and sleep quality. The NSQS is self-administered and is intended to assess change in nocturia's impact on sleep after treatment in a standardized manner. Psychometric evaluation is under way to describe key measurement properties. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background/objectives: Short sleep duration has been linked to maternal hyperglycaemia following a 1-h 50 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in observational studies conducted primarily in the USA. Our objective was to examine the relationship between objectively measured sleep duration and plasma glucose values following the 2-h 75 g OGTT routinely used in the UK amongst women with obesity.
   Methods: Sleep and OGTT data were available for 49 pregnant women who wore wrist actigraphs for at least two nights, and took a 2-h 75 g OGTT at the end of their second trimester. Multivariable regression was used to evaluate associations between sleep duration and OGTT results.
   Results: Higher 2-h plasma glucose values were significantly associated with shorter sleep duration and higher maternal age and BMI, with no association observed between wake after sleep onset (WASO) and 2-h plasma glucose values. No associations were observed between fasting plasma glucose values and any sleep parameters.
   Conclusions: We found that shorter sleep duration, as measured using actigraphy, is associated with higher 2-h plasma glucose values following a 2-h 75 g OGTT in the UK. These findings are in keeping with those observed elsewhere in the world, employing alternative OGTT protocols. Future studies should investigate sleep extension as a potential candidate for inclusion in future RCTs aiming to improve glucose tolerance and prevent GDM amongst those at risk.

AB Several monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) (omalizumab, mepolizumab, reslizumab, benralizumab, and dupilumab) are currently approved for the treatment of severe asthma. They have complex pharmacokinetic profiles. These profiles are unique in that they are dependent on their structure as well as can be markedly influenced by the biology of their target antigen, but their general behaviour can still be considered a class property, similar to their endogenous IgG counterpart. They cannot be administered by oral route, have a slow distribution into tissue, are metabolized to peptides and amino acids in several tissues but are protected from degradation by binding to protective receptors (the FcRn), which explains their long elimination half-lives. Their clearance is nonlinear because of the saturation of the target-mediated elimination. Also anti-drug antibody (ADA) response and off-target binding, as well as their glycosylation pattern, can influence the pharmacokinetics of mAbs.

AB Background: Quality of life (QoL) is an important outcome in the management of children with asthma. Mobile Health (m-Health) and Therapeutic Education Programs (TEPs) are increasingly recognized as essential components of pediatric asthma management to improve disease outcomes.
   Objective: To evaluate the effect of an education program (MyTherapeutic Education Program, MyTEP) that couples multidisciplinary TEP intervention with an m-Health Program (mHP) in improving QoL in asthmatic children.
   Methods: This single-center study employed a nonblinded randomized clinical trial design. Italian-speaking children (6-11 years) with mild-moderate asthma were eligible for participation. Participants were randomly paired 1: 1 with a control group that received mHP (smartphone app) or an intervention group that received MyTEP (TEP plus a smartphone app). Patients were followed up for 3 months. Descriptive statistics, Least Square (LS) mean change and Generalized Linear Mixed model were used for analysis.
   Results: Fifty patients were enrolled. The Pediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (PAQLQ) score improved in both MyTEP (p=0.014) and mHP (p=0.046) with the minimally clinically significant difference of >= 0.5 points reached in 23% of MyTEP and in 16% of mHP. Changes in PAQLQ scores were significantly greater in MyTEP than in mHP (LS mean difference: 0.269 p=0.05). PAQLQ score was: positively associated with MyTEP (p=0.023) and study time (p=0.002); and inversely associated with current passive smoke exposure (p=0.003).
   Conclusion: Despite the small sample size and short observation period, this study demonstrated that implementing a multidisciplinary TEP with an m-Health program results in gains in QoL of children with asthma.

AB Aim.: The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) with hypertension on telomerase activity, visfatin and adipsine concentration in the blood and vascular endothelial function assessed by ultrasound measured flow-mediated dilatation of the brachial artery (FMD).
   Material and methods: The study involved a group of 106 people (average age: 54.79 years). The determination of telomerase activity and blood visfatin and adipsine concentrations, brachial artery ultrasound examination with endothelium-dependent dilatation evaluation (FMD) and polysomnography were carried out.
   Results: Patients with hypertension without OSA were characterized by significantly greater FMD in comparison to patients with arterial hypertension and OSA (8.13 +/- 5.12 % vs. 6.82 +/- 5.36%; p < 0.05). Negative linear relationship between apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and FMD (r=-0.22, p < 0.05) has been demonstrated. Negative linear relationship between adipsine concentration in the blood and length of REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep (r=-0.21, p < 0.05) was found. Positive linear relationship between the concentration of visfatin in the blood and the length of REM sleep (r=0.22, p < 0.05) was also observed. Higher body mass index, higher total cholesterol, triglyceride and glucose levels have been shown to be independent predictors of higher AHI values, while greater telomerase activity, greater FMD and use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are independent predicators for lower AHI values.
   Conclusion: Higher values of AHI index in polysomnography in hypertensive patients can be related to lower telomerase activity in the blood and impaired function of vascular endothelial function assessed using ultrasound.

TI Subfreezing air as a cough trigger and multiple triggers are strongly
   associated with the presence of asthma in chronic cough
SO RESPIRATORY MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID VALIDITY; PATIENT
AB Background: Management of chronic cough relies on the recognition of cough background disorders. It is not known whether certain cough triggers are associated with specific background disorders.
   Methods: This was an e-mail study to public service employees of two towns in Finland. The questionnaire included twelve triggers. Current asthma was defined as doctor's diagnosis of asthma and current wheezing. Chronic rhinosinusitis was defined as either nasal blockage or nasal discharge and either facial pain/pressure or reduction/loss of smell for more than three months. Gastroesophageal reflux disease was defined as heartburn and/or regurgitation on at least one day a week during the last three months. Idiopathic cough was defined as absence of any of them.
   Results: There were 421 subjects with current cough that had lasted at least eight weeks. Subfreezing air as a cough trigger was associated with an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 7.27 (4.09-12.9), (p < 0.001), for current asthma. The number of cough triggers was largest in asthma, followed by chronic rhinosinusitis, gastro-esophageal reflux, and idiopathic cough (7.05 (6.14-7.96), 4.94 (4.35-5.54), 4.60 (3.77-5.43), and 3.44 (3.02-3.86), respectively, p < 0.001). Presence of five or more triggers was associated with an aOR of 7.49 (3.96-14.2), (p < 0.001) for current asthma. Absence of any cough triggers increased the probability of idiopathic cough (aOR 2.71 (1.54-4.77), p= 0.001).
   Conclusions: Subfreezing air as a cough trigger and multiple triggers are strongly associated with the presence of current asthma in chronic cough. Absence of any cough triggers increases the probability of idiopathic cough.

AB Background: Medication adherence is an important factor in the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, the rate of non-adherence to medications is high in COPD and is associated with worsened clinical outcomes and health-related quality of life for patients.
   Objectives: Our study aimed to evaluate the impact of a pharmaceutical care program led by pharmacists in the improvement of medication adherence and quality of life for COPD patients in Vietnam.
   Methods: A pre-and post-intervention study was conducted over 12 months. Pharmacists provided brief counselling which focused on the role of COPD medications and the importance of adherence. Morisky Medication Adherence Scale was used to evaluate patients' adherence. Quality of life was assessed using the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire and clinical outcomes were evaluated by symptom scores. These outcomes were reassessed at baseline (T0), after 3 months (T1), 6 months (T2) and 12 months (T3).
   Results: Study participants consisted of 211 COPD patients (mean age: 66.6 +/- 8.2 years). The percentage of patients with good adherence significantly increased from 37.4% to 53.2% (p < 0.001) after the program. Mean medication adherence scores improved from 6.7 (T0) to 7.4 (T2) and 7.4 (T3) (p < 0.001). EQ-5D-5L index values also increased from 0.47 (T0) to 0.59 (T3) (p < 0.001). There was no significant change in symptom scores across the duration of the study.
   Conclusions: Medication adherence and quality of life of COPD patients improved considerably after implementation of a pharmaceutical care program, thus supporting a vital role for pharmacists alongside physicians in the management of COPD.

ID TIOTROPIUM; COPD
AB Background: Prior replicate 12-week phase 3 trials demonstrated that once-daily doses of revefenacin inhalation solution at 88 mu g and 175 mu g produced significant bronchodilation over 24 h post dose in patients with moderate to very severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The objective was to characterize the safety profile of revefenacin 88 mu g and 175 mu g over 52 weeks of treatment.
   Methods: In this randomized, parallel-group, 52-week trial (NCT02518139), 1055 participants with moderate to very severe COPD received revefenacin 88 mu g or 175 mu g in a double-blind manner, or open-label active control tiotropium.
   Results: Treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) were comparable across all treatment groups (n [%] patients; revefenacin 88 mu g, 272 [74.7%]; 175 mu g, 242 [72.2%]; tiotropium, 275 [77.2%]). Numerically fewer COPD exacerbations (n [%] patients) were observed with revefenacin 175 mu g (73 [21.8%]) than with 88 mu g (107 [29.4%]) or tiotropium (100 [28.1%]). Serious AEs were comparable with revefenacin 88 mu g (58 [15.9%] and tiotropium (58 [16.3%]), but were lower with revefenacin 175 mu g (43 [12.8%]), and mortality was low. In patients using revefenacin 88 mu g or tiotropium with a concurrent long-acting beta-agonist (LABA) product, the incidence of AEs was slightly higher than without concurrent LABA. LABA did not affect the incidence of AEs for patients who received revefenacin 175 mu g.
   Conclusions: Revefenacin was generally well tolerated over 52 weeks of treatment, and had a safety profile that supports its use as a long-term once-daily bronchodilator for the nebulized treatment of COPD.

AB Background: Patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) demonstrate a range of lung function impairment. However, the efficacy of antifibrotics compared with placebo has not been assessed in patients with more advanced disease. This post-hoc analysis investigated the efficacy and safety of pirfenidone versus placebo in patients with IPF and more advanced lung function impairment, defined as percent predicted forced vital capacity (% FVC) < 50% and/or percent predicted carbon monoxide diffusing capacity<35%.
   Methods: Patients randomised to pirfenidone 2,403 mg/day or placebo in the ASCEND (NCT01366209) and CAPACITY (NCT00287716; NCT00287729) trials with more advanced baseline lung function impairment (pirfenidone, n= 90; placebo, n= 80) were included. Mortality, lung function, hospitalisation, exercise capacity and dyspnoea were investigated over 52 weeks.
   Results: At Week 52 versus placebo, pirfenidone was associated with significantly lower risks of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 0.28; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.09-0.86; p= 0.0180), >= 10% absolute % FVC decline or all-cause mortality (HR 0.40; 95% CI 0.23-0.69; p= 0.0006) and >= 10% absolute % FVC decline or respiratory-related hospitalisation or all-cause mortality (HR 0.46; 95% CI 0.28-0.76; p= 0.0018). At Week 52, median treatment differences favouring pirfenidone were 36.7m for 6-min walk distance and -8.0 points for the University of California-San Diego Shortness of Breath Questionnaire total score. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) led to discontinuation in 14.4% and 21.3% of patients with pirfenidone and placebo, respectively.
   Conclusion: Pirfenidone demonstrated clinically relevant benefits across multiple domains in patients with IPF and more advanced disease without an increased risk of discontinuation due to TEAEs.

AB Background: Cystic fibrosis affects 1/3200 Caucasians. This genetic disease disturbs the ion and water home-ostasis across epithelia, thus rendering mucus more viscous and harder to expel. Conventional treatments rely on the clapping method coupled with postural drainage. Despite the effectiveness of these procedures, they are invasive and enervating.
   Methods: Here we study a new mechano-acoustic treatment device to help patients expectorate excess mucus, the Frequencer (TM). We test both normal and pathological synthetic mucin solutions (1 % and 4 % by weight) in vitro. We varied the frequency applied (from 20 Hz to 60 Hz) as well as the amplitude (from 50 % to 100 % intensity). Moreover, we assessed the effect of NaCl on mucus rehydration.
   Results: A frequency of 40 Hz coupled with a 0.5 gL(-1) NaCl solution provokes partial mucus rehydration, regardless of the amplitude selected, as the work of adhesion measurements evidenced.
   Conclusions: Mechanical solicitation is fundamental to help patients affected by cystic fibrosis expectorate mucus. With an operating frequency of 20 Hz to 65 Hz, the Frequencer (TM) provides a gentler therapy than traditional methods (conventional chest physiotherapy). The Frequencer (TM) proved to be effective in the homogenization of synthetic mucin solutions in vitro in 20 min and elicited improved effectiveness in a mucin-rich environment.

AB Background: Beneficial effects from non-invasive ventilation (NIV) in acute COPD are well-established, but the impact of nebulization during NIV has not been well described.
   Aim: To compare pulmonary deposition and distribution across regions of interest with administration of radiolabeled aerosols generated by vibrating mesh nebulizers (VMN) and jet nebulizer (JN) during NIV.
   Methods: A crossover single dose study involving 9 stable subjects with moderate to severe COPD randomly allocated to receive aerosol administration by the VMN Aerogen and the MistyNeb jet nebulizer operating with oxygen at 8 lpm during NIV. Radiolabeled bronchodilators (fill volume of 3 mL: 0.5 mL salbutamol 2.5 mg + 0.125 mL ipratropium 0.25 mg and physiologic saline up to 3 mL) were delivered until sputtering during NIV (pressures of 12 cmH2O and 5 cmH2O - inspiratory and expiratory, respectively) using an oro-nasal facemask. Radioactivity counts were performed using a gamma camera and regions of interest (ROIs) were delimited. Aerosol mass balance based on counts from the lungs, upper airways, stomach, nebulizer, circuit, inspiratory and expiratory filters, and mask were determined and expressed as a percentage of the total.
   Results: Both inhaled and lung doses were greater with VMN (22.78 +/- 3.38% and 12.05 +/- 2.96%, respectively) than JN (12.51 +/- 6.31% and 3.14 +/- 1.71%; p=0.008). Residual drug volume was lower in VMN than in JN (3.08 +/- 1.3% versus 46.44 +/- 5.83%, p=0.001). Peripheral deposition of radioaerosol was significantly lower with JN than VMN.
   Conclusions: VMN deposited > 3 fold more radioaerosol into the lungs of moderate to severe COPD patients than JN during NIV.

AB Background: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterised by recurring exacerbations. We estimated the costs of healthcare resources for COPD management funded by the Italian National Healthcare Service (INHS) for one year.
   Methods: We examined the demographic, clinical, and economic variables at enrolment and follow-up visits (at 6 and 12 months) of COPD patients participating in the SAT study and referred to 20 Italian pulmonary centres with different institutional characteristics. Costs were expressed in Euro ((sic)) 2018. A random effects log-linear panel regression model was performed to predict the average cost per patient.
   Results: Most of the centres were public institutions (90%; public university hospital: 30%). The total average cost of COPD was (sic)2647.38/patient and ICS/LABA/LAMA therapy contributed the most ((sic)1541.45). The average cost was (sic)6206.19/patient for severe COPD (+139.67% vs the cost/patient with mild or moderate COPD). The regression model showed that, others things being equal, increases in the predicted average logged cost per patient were due to liquid oxygen therapy (+468.31%), three COPD exacerbations during the follow-up (+254.54%), and ICS/LABA or ICS/LABA/LAMA associated therapy (+59.26%). Moreover, a 1.19% increment was observed for each additional score of the CAT questionnaire. Conversely, a 36.52% reduction in the predicted average logged cost was reported for hospitals managed by local healthcare authorities.
   Conclusions: The health econometric approach is innovative in the management of COPD patients in Italy. The results of the random effects log-linear panel data regression model may help clinicians estimate INHS costs when managing COPD patients.

AB As many as 25% of all patients undergoing invasive pulmonary procedures are receiving at least one antiplatelet or anticoagulant agent. For those undergoing elective procedures, the decision-making process is uncomplicated and the procedure may be postponed until the antiplatelet or anticoagulant agent may be safely held. However, many invasive pulmonary procedures are semi-elective or emergent in nature in which case a risk-benefit calculation and discussion occur between the provider and patient or surrogate decision-maker. Therefore, it is critical for providers to have an awareness of the risk of bleeding complications with different pulmonary procedures on various antiplatelet and anticoagulant agents. This systematic review summarizes the bleeding complications associated with different pulmonary procedures in patients on various antiplatelet or anticoagulant agents in the literature and reveals a paucity of high-quality evidence across a wide spectrum of pulmonary procedures and antiplatelet or anticoagulant agents. The results of this review can help inform providers of the bleeding risk in these patients to aid in the shared decision-making process and risk vs benefit discussion.

AB Introduction: A proportion of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) have autoantibodies directed against intracellular targets. This study aimed to determine the relationship between serologic status, lung function decline and survival.
   Methods: IPF patients assessed for antinuclear antibody (ANA) and related antigen-specific serology detected by addressable laser bead immunoassay (ALBIA) were included. Demographics, serial pulmonary function tests and survival were compared between patients with and without autoantibodies. Linear mixed models were used to estimate changes in forced vital capacity (FVC) and diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) over time. Cox-proportional hazards models were used to compare survival, adjusted for a composite score including age, sex and baseline lung function.
   Results: Of 61 included patients, the mean baseline age was 70 years (SD = 9), 77% were male, and 87% were Caucasian. Either ANA or antigen-specific serology by ALBIA was positive in 25 (41%) during follow-up. ANA was detected in 23 (38%), and specific autoantibodies by ALBIA in 6 (10%). There was no difference in age, sex, race, smoking status, anti-fibrotic use or baseline FVC or DLCO in patients with and without autoantibodies. There was no association between autoantibody status and survival (HR = 1.18, 95% CI 0.61, 2.29), rate of decline in FVC or DLCO (difference in FVC = 4.2 mL/year, p = 0.82; difference in DLCO = 4.6* 10(-4) mL/min/mmHg/year, p= 0.20).
   Conclusion: These data suggest that autoantibodies are common in IPF and that patients with a subset of autoantibodies, but without features of autoimmunity, demonstrate similar disease behaviour to those without autoantibodies.

AB Mitochondrial homoplasmy is essential for normal development, as its heteroplasmy usually leads to abnormal or diseased phenotypes in mammals. So far, diverse mechanisms have been proposed to play roles in ensuring uniparental inheritance of mitochondria in many organisms. In recent years, hybrid yellow catfish from mating female yellow catfish (Pelteobagrus fulvidraco) with male darkbarbel catfish (Pelteobagrus vachelli) has been widely cultured in China due to its fast-growing. However, a high rate of abnormal and defective embryos was observed in the offsprings of hybrid yellow catfish. In this study, we systematically investigated the elimination process of paternal mitochondria] DNA (mtDNA) in yellow catfish and hybrid yellow catfish. The mtDNA contents significantly decreased in the isolated mature sperm compared with the semen. Different from the elimination of paternal mtDNA after fertilization in yellow catfish, paternal mtDNA was retained in the developmental embryos of hybrid yellow catfish as later as gastrula stage, indicating a delay of elimination for paternal mtDNA and mitochondrial heteroplasmy during embryogenesis in hybrid yellow catfish. Altogether, the present study suggests that mitochondrial heteroplasmy may affect embryonic development of hybrid progeny between catfish species.

AB Although exercise training (ET) with low to moderate intensity improves several physiological aspects of brain, the effects of high intensity interval training (HIIT) are less clear on brain plasticity and cytoplasmic transport. The present study examined the effects of HIIT on the gene and protein expressions of kinesin family member 5B (KIF5B) and Dynein in the Wistar male rat hippocampal tissue. Fourteen male Wistar rats were separated into 2 groups: (1) the training group (TG: n = 7) and (2) the control group (CG: n = 7). The exercise protocol was carried out on a rodent treadmill (5 days a week for 6 weeks). The protein contents of KIF5B and Dynein were determined by the immunohistochemical analysis. Moreover, the Real-Time polymerase chain reaction (Real Time PCR) procedure was done to measure the KIF5B mRNA and Dynein mRNA expressions. It was observed that HIIT resulted in a significant decrease in the gene expressions of KIF5B and Dynein (P = 0.001), and also the results showed that HIIT leads to a significant decrease in KIF5B (P = 0.001) and Dynein (P = 0.02) protein content of the hippocampal tissue in comparison with sedentary rats. Our findings demonstrated that HIIT is associated with the down-regulation of gene and protein levels of KIF5B and Dynein in the rat hippocampal tissue, although the underlying mechanisms have remained unknown. These changes suggest that HIIT may have negative effects on both the anterograde and retrograde cytoplasmic transports because the cytoplasmic transport is mediated by KIF5B and Dynein.

   Methods: Gene and protein expression levels of CCN2 were assessed using quantitative real-time PCR and western blot. Transfections and dual luciferase assays were performed to measure the effect of hyperosmolarity, tonicity enhancer binding protein (TonEBP) and Ca2+-calcineurin (Cn)-NFAT signaling on CCN2 promoter activity.
   Results: Cultured in hyperosmotic media, there was a significant decrease in the levels of CCN2 promoter activity, gene and protein expression in NP cells. The JASPAR database was used to analyze the construction of human CCN2 promoter, we found conserved TonE and NFAT binding sites. We then investigated whether TonEBP controlled CCN2 expression. Forced expression of TonEBP in NP cells showed that TonEBP negatively regulated CCN2 promoter activity, while suppression of TonEBP induced CCN2 promoter activity and expression. We then examined if Ca2+-Cn-NFAT signaling participated in the regulation of CCN2 expression. Co-expression of CCN2 reporter with individual NFAT1-4 expression plasmids and/or calcineurin A/B constructs suggested this signaling pathway played a role in the regulation of CCN2expression in NP cells.
   Conclusions: Results of these studies illustrated that the expression of CCN2 in NP cells was regulated by the NFAT family through a signaling pathway network involving both activator (Ca2+-Cn-NFAT signaling) and suppressor (Hyperosmolarity-TonEBP) molecules.

TI Molecular analysis of ampR and ampD to understand variability in
   inducible expression of "BlaB-like" cephalosporinase in Yersinia
   enterocolitica biotype 1A
SO GENE

DT Article

ID BETA-LACTAMASE; VIRULENCE
AB Yersinia enterocolitica strains produce two chromosomal beta-lactamases, BIaA - a constitutively produced penicillinase, and BlaB - an inducible "AmpC-type" cephalosporinase. As in other members of Enterobacteriaceae, expression of ampC in Y. enterocolitica is regulated by the genes - ampR and ampD. The ampR encodes a transcriptional regulator which represses the expression of ampC and, ampD encodes a cytoplasmic N-acetyl-anhydromuramyl-c-alanine amidase which participates in recycling of peptidoglycan. Exposure of bacteria to antibiotics like imipenem and cefoxitin results in generation and accumulation of large quantities of muropeptides in cytoplasm which is beyond the recycling capability of AmpD. These muropeptides bind to AmpR, converting it into an activator of ampC expression (ampC de-repression). Earlier studies from our laboratory indicated that instead of BlaB, Y. enterocolitica biotype 1A strains produced a "BlaB-like" enzyme which was non-heterogeneous and showed a differential expression when induced with imipenem. The detection of "BlaB-like" cephalosporinase which was also induced differentially in Y. enterocolitica biotype 1A strains presented an opportunity to discern newer mechanisms, if any, which may underlie inducible expression of "AmpC-type" cephalosporinases. Thus, the objective of the present study was to understand the role of ampR and ampD in regulating differential expression of "BlaB-like" cephalosporinases in biotype 1A strains. Analysis of promoters and amino acid sequences of AmpR revealed that these were conserved in all strains of biotype 1A. Analysis of AmpD amino acid sequences revealed that five variants of AmpD were present which did not contribute to hyper-inducible production of "BlaB-like" enzyme. In-silico prediction of the mRNA secondary structures of ampD revealed significant differences, which might have affected the rate of translation of ampD and accumulation of un-recycled muropeptides inside the cell leading to hyper production of "BlaB-like" cephalosporinases in some Y. enterocolitica biotype 1A strains. The findings provide newer insights to our understanding of the mechanisms underlying regulation of expression of "AmpC-type" beta-lactamases.

AB The microbial community mediated biogeochemical cycles play important role in global C-cycle and display a sensitive response to environmental changes. Limited information is available on microbial composition and functional diversity controlling biogeochemical cycles in the riverine environment. The Ganga River water and sediment samples were studied for environmental gene tags with reference to carbohydrate metabolism, photoheterotrophy and chemolithotrophy using high throughput shotgun metagenomic sequencing and functional annotation. The diversity of environmental gene tags specific microbial community was annotated against reference sequence database using Kaiju taxonomic classifier. The metagenomic analyses revealed that the river harbored a broad range of carbohydrate and energy metabolism genes. The in-depth investigation of metagenomic data revealed that the enzymes associated with reverse TCA cycle, Calvin-Benson cycle enzyme RuBisCO, starch and sucrose metabolism genes were highly abundant. The enzymes associated with sulfur metabolism such as EC:2.7.7.4 (sulfate to ammonium per sulfate), EC:1.8.1.2, EC:1.8.7.1 (sulfite to H2S) were prevalent in both the class of samples. The principal component analysis of the functional profiles revealed that the water and sediment samples were clustered distinctly suggesting that both the sites had variable abundance of functional genes and associated microbiota. The taxonomic classification showed abundance of Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes phyla. Also, the metagenomic study showed the presence of purple sulfur bacteria viz. Thiodictyon, Nitrosococcus and purple non-sulfur bacteria viz. Bradyrhozobium and Rhodobacter. The study demonstrates that the Ganga River microbiome has prevalence of functional genes involved in carbohydrate anabolism and catabolism, and CO2 fixation with great prospects in cellulose and sulfide degrading enzyme production and characterization.

AB Angiogenesis is recognized as a sign of cancer and facilitates cancer progression and metastasis. Suppression of angiogenesis is a desirable strategy for gastric cancer (GC) management. In this study, we showed a novel role of gastrin in angiogenesis of GC. We observed that treatment with gastrin 17 (G17) increased the proliferation of AGS cells and enhanced tube formation during normoxia and hypoxia. The expression level of VEGF were increased by G17 treatment as well. Experiments on the mechanism showed that G17 promoted HIF-1 alpha expression, which subsequently enhanced beta-catenin nuclear localization and activation of TCF3 and LEF1 and finally resulted in angiogenesis by upregulating VEGF. An in vivo experiment confirmed that G17 enhanced GC cell proliferation and angiogenesis in the resultant tumor. In conclusion, our findings indicate that gastrin promotes angiogenesis via activating HIF-1 alpha/beta-catenin/VEGF axis in GC.

AB Synthetic biology with genetically engineered (GE) cyanobacteria has the potential to produce valuable products such as biofuels. However, it is also essential to assess the potential risks of synthetic biology technology before it can be widely used. In order to address key concerns posed by the application of synthetic biology to microorganisms, studies were designed to monitor the horizontal transfer of engineered genes from GE cyanobacteria Thermosynechococcus elongatus BP1 to Escherichia coli through co-incubation. The results of these experiments demonstrated that the genetically engineered DNA construct containing alcohol producing genes and kanamycin resistance can be horizontally transferred from GE T. elongatus BP1 to wild-type E. coli following two days of liquid co-culturing. The rapid and facile transfer of foreign genes, which include antibiotic resistance, between bacterial communities signifies the need to continue to deepen our understanding of the process of horizontal gene transfer, chromosomal integration as well as further biosafety-oriented research efforts. In the era of synthetic biology, the natural microbial process for sharing genetic material will also significantly impact risk assessments, containment approaches and further policy development.

AB Mucopolysaccharidosis IVA (MPS IVA) is a lysosomal storage disease caused by biallelic mutations in GALNS gene and characterized by progressive skeletal deformities with short stature. The aim of this study was to evaluate the genotype, longitudinal height measurement and clinical features of MPS IVA patients. Thirty-two patients from 22 families were enrolled. The ages of patients at diagnosis ranged from two months to 18 years of age, and followed up for three to twenty years. They were classified as severe and attenuated form (intermediate and mild) according to their height measurements. The mean height standard deviation scores (SDS) for Turkish standards at 0-3, 5 and 10 years of ages were found to be -1.1, -4.2 and -7.3 respectively in patients with severe phenotype, while they were +0.4, -1.5 and -3 for intermediate phenotype. Patients with severe form reached a mean final height of -8.5 SDS, and mild phenotype -3.6 SDS. The most common initial and current symptoms in the patients with the severe phenotype were pectus carinatus and/or kyphosis deformities which occurred between 5 months and 3 years of age, and genu valgum deformity which developed after 3 years of age. However, kyphoscoliosis was the most common initial and current findings in the attenuated phenotype. Although, initial symptoms appeared in early childhood in the intermediate phenotype, similar to the severe phenotype, the clinical findings progressed slowly and genu valgum deformity did not develop. In patients with mild phenotype, the onset of symptoms was after 5 years of age. In conclusion, this study provides significant insights into the initial and follow-up clinical features and height values that contribute to the differential diagnosis of the severe and intermediate phenotypes in early childhood. Eleven mutations in GALNS gene in which one of them is novel (c.416G > A) were associated with the severe phenotype and three mutations (c.1038C > A, c.850T > G, c.752G > A) lead to the attenuated phenotype.

AB Aim: The purpose of the present study is to evaluate and understand the association of global and MTHFR gene specific methylation in preeclampsia and recurrent miscarriages in light of MTHFR C677T polymorphism.
   Methods: The subjects comprised of recurrent miscarriage cases, their gestation matched controls, preeclampsia cases and matched controls. A set of women at full term were also recruited. Fasting blood sample (similar to 5 ml) was drawn from all the participants followed by DNA extraction, global DNA methylation and MTHFR gene specific methylation. MTHFR C677T polymorphism was analysed by PCR followed by RFLP.
   Results higher: Global DNA methylation at maternal front (p = 0.04) and hypomethylation of MTHFR gene at fetal front (p = 0.001) might be a characteristic of preeclampsia. Recurrent miscarriage cases were having significantly (p = 0.002) hyper MTHFR gene specific methylation as compared to controls. Women carrying CT genotype were found to be having significantly (p = 0.001) higher global DNA methylation in PE cases and MTHFR gene specific methylation (p = 0.005) in RM cases. Intergenerational analysis revealed similar patterns of global DNA methylation and MTHFR gene specific methylation among both PE and RM cases at maternal and fetal fronts.
   Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of global DNA methylation in Preeclampsia and MTHFR gene specific methylation in recurrent miscarriages. MTHFR C677T gene polymorphism in association with global and gene specific methylation seem to play a pivotal role in PE and RM respectively.

AB MC4R gene is a hypothalamic satiety control mediator in which mutations cause a monogenic form of obesity. The aim of this study was to perform a genetic screening to identify variations in the entire region of MC4R gene. A total of 236 unrelated and severely obese patients (BMI >= 40 kg/m(2)) with Spanish ancestry and severe overweight familiar history have been enrolled into the study. Seven MC4R gene variants were identified in the heterozygous state in 21 patients. Coding variants p.Thr101Ile and p.Ala259Asp are new and variants p.Ser30Phe, p.Val103Ile and p.Ile251Leu were previously described. Two variants have been also observed in the promoter region of the MC4R gene; the c.-24G > A mutation, described for the first time, and the known c.-178A > C variant. Both in silico and family segregation analysis confirm the correlation between novel identified mutations in MC4R gene and obesity development. The correlation between the four variants (c.-24G > A, p.Thr101Ile, p.Ala259Asp and p.Ser30Phe) and the obesity phenotype, therefore, allows the conclusion that all of the four mutations cause a monogenic form of obesity.

AB Background: Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several genetic variants that influence the risk of dyslipidemia and coronary artery disease (CAD). In this study, we have examined the potential association of five SNPs variants related to lipid pathway, previously identified in GWAS studies (ZNF259 C > G, CETP I405VA/G, LPA C > T, LPLS447X and PSRC1 A > G) with CAD.
   Methods: Two hundred and ninety subjects including 194 patients with coronary artery disease and 96 controls were enrolled, followed by the analyses of anthropometric/biochemical parameters. Genotyping was carried out using Taq-Man real-time PCR based method. The association of the genetic polymorphisms with CAD was determined using univariate and multivariate analyses.
   Results: CAD patients had a higher (p < 0.05) fasting blood glucose (FBG), total cholesterol (TC), high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and waist circumference. Results showed that subjects with CETP rs5882 genetic variant, AA&AG genotypes, had a higher risk of developing Coronary artery disease [OR: 2.1, 95% CI (1.2-4.1), p value = 0.015]. Also subjects who carried the G allele of the ZNF259 polymorphism were at an increased the risk of developing CAD [OR 1.86, 95% CI: 1.06-3.25, p value = 0.029] and had an increased TC, LDL and TG levels (p < 0.05). Furthermore, no statistically significant association was found between genetic polymorphisms of PSRC1 A > G, LPL S447X and LPA C > T and CAD.
   Conclusion: We identified a relationship between a genetic variant in CETP and ZNF259 gene with CAD and CAD and lipid profile, respectively. Further investigation in a larger population may help to investigate the value of emerging marker as a risk stratification marker in CAD and its risk factors.

AB The purpose of this study is to profile the clinical and genetic features of Japanese Waardenburg syndrome (WS) patients and validate the W index. Sixteen Japanese WS families with congenital sensorineural hearing loss were included in the study. The inner canthal, interpupillary, and outer canthal distances (ICD, IPD, and OCD) were measured for all patients, and patients were screened for presence of PAX3, MITF, SOX10, and EDNRB mutations. The WS patients were clinically classified under the current W index as follows: 13 families with WS1, 2 families with WS2, and 1 family with WS4. In the 13 WS1 families, genetic tests found PAX3 mutations in 5 families, MITF mutations in 4 families, SOX1 0 mutations in 3 families, and EDNRB mutations in 1 family. 61% of clinically classified WS1 patients under the current W index conflicted with the genetic classification, which implies W index is not appropriate for Japanese population. Resetting the threshold of W index or novel index formulated with ethnicity matched samples is necessary for clinical classification which is consistent with genetic classification for WS patients with distinct ethnicity.

AB LncRNA CASC11 is a recently identified oncogenic IncRNA in colorectal cancer. This study aimed to investigate the role of IncRNA CASC11 in small cell lung cancer (SCLC). In the present study, expression levels of CASC11 and TGF-beta 1 were found to be positively and significantly correlated with the percentage of CDD133+ cells of SCLC cell lines. Plasma CASC11 and TGF-131 were upregulated and positively correlated in SCLC patients, but not in healthy controls. Upregulation of plasma CASC11 and TGF-beta 1 predicted poor survival of SCLC patients. Overexpression of CASC11 and TGF-beta 1 also resulted in the increased percentage of CDD133 + cells of SCLC cell lines, while TGF-beta inhibitor attenuated the effects of CASC11 overexpression. CASC11 overexpression mediated the upregulation of TGF-beta 1 in SCLC cells, while treatment with exogenous TGF-beta 1 showed no significant effect on CASC11. Therefore, lncRNA CASC11 promotes TGF-beta 1, increases cancer cell sternness and predicts postoperative survival in SCLC.

DE Asparagine synthetase deficiency; Microcephaly; ASNS gene; In silico
   characterization
AB In the current study, we report three cases of Asparagine Synthetase (ASNS) Deficiency from two consanguineous families. Family 1 had two early neonatal deaths due to a novel mutation in the ASNS gene c.788C > T (p.S263F) and both the children presented with microcephaly and one of them had severe intracranial haemorrhage. The proband from the second family was homozygous for c.146G > A (p.R49Q) and manifested myoclonic seizures, developmental delay, coarse hair and diffuse cortical atrophy. Molecular docking studies of both the mutations revealed alteration in the ligand binding site. Till date, 26 mutations were reported in ASNS gene in 29 affected children indicating high degree of genetic heterogeneity and high mortality. Although asparagine depletion is not of diagnostic utility, multiple linear regression model suggested that asparagine levels vary to the extent of 20.6% based on glutamine and aspartate levels and ASNS deficiency results in depletion of asparagine synthesis. ASNS deficiency should be suspected in any neonate with microcephaly and epileptic encephalopathy.

AB Lynch syndrome (LS) is a common cancer syndrome that is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Its pathogenesis is thought to be closely related to germline mutations of mismatch repair (MMR) genes such as the MLHI, MSH2, PMS2 and MSH6 genes. This study identifies a Chinese family with LS clinically diagnosed according to the Amsterdam II criteria. In these patients, immuno-histochemical staining showed negative MSH6 expressions but positive MLHJ, MSH2, and PMS2 expressions. In order to further explore the molecular biology of this LS family, we used targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) and Multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification (MLPA) to identify the mutation and verify the authenticity of the mutation in 15 family members. For NGS, two panels have been used, one is of MLHJ, MSH2, PMS2 and MSH6 genes, the other one is of 139 cancer genetic susceptibility genes. And for the large deletions/duplications can also be identified by NGS panel, an adjusted data analysis strategy of NGS has been used. As a result, we identified a novel heterozygous large deletion in MSH6 gene that was found to be co-segregated among affected family members. This deletion results in the loss of a 3246 bp-sized fragment in MSH6 gene exons 5-9 which represents the coding regions of the MSH6 ATPase domain. This novel mutation has yet to be documented in the International Society for Gastrointestinal Hereditary Tumours (InSiGHT) database. This mutation resulted in MSH6 protein losing gene mismatch repair function, and further caused the microsatellite instable. We speculate that this mutation may significantly impact MMR function through impaired ATP domain function. Theoretically, this proband would likely benefit from PD 1 immune check-point blockade therapy, but conversely, we observed that tumors appeared to rapidly progress after 4 sessions of anti-PD-1 treatment. Further studies to validate the effectiveness of anti-PD-1 treatments in carriers of this mutation are necessary.

ID HOMOZYGOUS MUTATION; PHARC SYNDROME; HEARING-LOSS; GENETICS; MODEL
AB Usher syndrome (USH) is a clinically common autosomal recessive disorder characterized by retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and sensorineural hearing loss with or without vestibular dysfunction. In this study, we identified a Hunan family of Chinese descent with two affected members clinically diagnosed with Usher syndrome type 3 (USH3) displaying hearing, visual acuity, and olfactory decline. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) identified a nonsense variant in ABHD12 gene that was confirmed to be segregated in this family by Sanger sequencing and exhibited a recessive inheritance pattern. In this family, two patients carried homozygous variant in the ABHD12 (NM_015600: c.249C > G). Mutation of ABHD12, an enzyme that hydrolyzes an endocannabinoid lipid transmitter, caused incomplete PHARC syndrome, as demonstrated in previous reports. Therefore, we also conducted a summary based on variants in ABHD12 in PHARC patients, and in PHARC patients showing that there was no obvious correlation between the genotype and phenotype. We believe that this should be considered during the differential diagnosis of USH. Our findings predicted the potential function of this gene in the development of hearing and vision loss, particularly with regard to impaired signal transmission, and identified a novel nonsense variant to expand the variant spectrum in ABHD12.

AB Cancer is caused by malfunctioning of genes that normally regulate cardinal processes including various nuclear functions, cell division and survival, cell surface to nucleus signaling cascades, etc. Cancer associated genes are often classified as oncogenes (OCGs) or tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) depending on whether they promote or suppress tumorigenesis, respectively. Such strict classification of cancer genes may however be an over-simplification. Several studies have highlighted a dual role for cancer genes, often impacting the same facet of tumorigenesis. Knowledge of a possible dichotomy of a cancer gene (particularly an OCG) is imperative when evaluating its possible utility as a therapeutic target. Though previous studies have extensively evaluated specific examples of cancer genes exhibiting a dual nature, efforts to unravel the molecular basis for such contrasting functions have been fewer. The current review is an attempt to delineate molecular events underlying the functional dichotomy of cancer genes at the DNA (mutations, gene fusions, etc.), RNA (alternative splicing, regulation through non-coding RNAs, etc.) and protein (isoforms, mis-localisation, post-translational modifications, proteolytic cleavage, etc.) levels.

AB To maintain normal function of cartilage tissue normally, the presence of a sufficient amount of type II collagen and aggrecan is essential, and their synthesis is tightly regulated. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms that control the expression of type II collagen and aggrecan would be useful for understanding gene expression changes in diseases such as osteoarthritis. Recently, we have identified two pairs of enhancer elements, termed El and E2 in the type II collagen gene and Ea and Eb in the aggrecan gene. However, their different mechanisms of action remained unclear. Thus, the central aim of this study was to clarify the different transcriptional regulation mediated through each enhancer element. To this end, we established different stable reporter cell lines that express a reporter gene under the control of different enhancer elements using a silent reporter system we previously constructed. Using these cell lines, we found that dexamethasone, forskolin, and trichostatin A affect the gene expression of type II collagen and aggrecan via different enhancer elements. Moreover, we clarified that El and E2 enhancer activities are regulated through distinct epigenetic modifications by histone deacetylase 10 and sirtuin 6.

AB Thyroid cancer is the most common type of endocrine tumor. The TNM classification remains a standard for treatment determination and predicting prognosis in thyroid cancer. The genes modules associated with the progression of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) were not clear. We applied a weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and differential expression analysis to systematically identified co-expressed gene modules and hub genes associated with PTC progression based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) PTC transcriptome sequencing data. An independent validation cohort, GSE27155, was used to evaluate the preservation of gene modules. We identified two co-expressed genes modules associated with progression of PTC. Enrichment analysis indicated that the two modules were enriched in angiogenesis and extracellular matrix organization. DCN, COL1A1, COL1A2, COL5A2 and COL3A1 were hub genes in the co-expressed network. We systematically identified co-expressed gene modules and hub genes associated with PTC progression for the first time, which provided insights into the mechanisms underlying PTC progression and some potential targets for the treatment of PTC.

AB Crude oil in unconventional shale systems, present as tight oil and shale oil, accumulates inside an oil kitchen in formations with coexistent sources and reservoirs. Organic matter present in oil shale is not yet mature and requires heating to convert it into crude oil. Oil exploration in shale systems involves the exploration of shale oil retained in source rocks and tight oil rich zones located near source rocks. Tight oil is a type of realistic unconventional oil resources in China. The marked increase in potential shale oil reserves, and exploration of these reserves, will result in a shale oil revolution similar to that experienced for shale gas. Based on a systematic comparison of geologic features of shale systems in the US and China, the geologic significance of the sweet spots in shale systems is proposed. This zone contains an abundance of unconventional oil in shale systems that can be explored and developed under current economic and technical conditions. The sweet spot zone refers to the zone in the tight oil rich zone which has industrial value within the scope of matured high-quality source rocks on the plane. The sweet spot interval refers to the high-productivity interval of tight oil which has industrial value through artificial stimulation. The main aim of oil exploration in shale formations is to identify the sweet spots. The distribution of the economic sweet spots in shale systems is evaluated by overlapping the geologic, engineering and economic sweet spots. Resource assessment techniques, the identification of logging data properties, high-resolution 3D seismic surveys, horizontal well production from well pads, and artificial reservoir development of sweet spots in oil-bearing shale formations can assist efficient development of oil. Globally, shale formations contain a significant volume of oil reserves. Currently, stimulated reservoir volume (SRV) techniques in horizontal wells in marine shale gas formations in the United States have average peak-productivity cycles of 10-15 years. To achieve commecial oil production in lacustrine shale systems in China, it is important to utilize large formation thicknesses and the high abundance of organic matter. In addition, the development of practical and economic techniques will result in an increase of productivity of tight oil and shale oil by 30-50 million tons, as well as the economic development of oil in lacustrine shale systems in China.

AB Lacustrine tight oil resources in China are significant exploration targets, similar to the marine tight oil resources in North America, while there are clear differences in terms of the forming environment, as well as reservoir properties of these two systems. In this study, the geological characteristics of lacustrine tight rocks are discussed, including the distribution, petrology, storage space, and movable fluid saturation. The tight rocks are consisted of tight sandstone, tight carbonate rock, tight peperite, and tight sedimentary tuff, in which inter-granular pores and dissolved pores with the dimensions of 30-900 nm are mainly dominated by the storage space. The oil saturation typically exceeds 50% and the oil mobility is basically controlled by pore-throats with diameter less than 1 mu m. These four types of reservoirs show different potentials for tight oil, in which tight sandstone plays in the Ordos Basin and the Songliao Basin are taken as the preferred targets into account for exploration and development. Although the distribution area, physical properties, and mobility of lacustrine tight oil in China are not as good as those of tight oil in North America, the lacustrine reservoirs are often stacked in multiple layers, resulting in a great thickness, and possess relatively high oil saturation, making them pro-ducible and commercially viable. Fluid properties are critical to effectively recovery of tight oil, and more comprehensive geological evaluation on fluid mobility should be undertaken.

AB Tight oil in China is mainly distributed in Mesozoic-Cenozoic continental petroliferous basins, either generally occurs in tight sandstone or tight carbonate reservoirs which are paragenetic to or in contact with lacustrine petroleum source rocks. By the end of 2016, the continental tight oil in China has established an annual production capacity of 1.55 million tons, and a cumulative oil production of 2.52 million tons. In 2016, the continental tight oil production in China was about 800,000 tons. By analyzing the characterization of the tight oil in Ordos Basin, Songliao Basin, Jungar Basin, the organic-rich shale in China were formed in multiple geological periods including the Permian, Triassic, Jurassic, Cretaceous, Neogene, and Paleogene, in freshwater, semi-saline to hyper-saline lacustrine depositional setting. They are generally tens of meters to several hundreds of meters thick, have total organic carbon (TOC) contents of 0.4-16%, and thermal maturity of 0.4-1.4%. Algal bloom as results of volcanism, low sedimentation rate, transgression, and stratification of water body are prominent factors controlling the formation of organic-rich shales. Tight oil reservoirs in China mainly include tight sandstone, tight carbonate rock, tight sedimentary tuff, etc., all of which are characterized by strong heterogeneity and poor petrophysical properties, with in situ porosity and permeability generally no more 12% and 1 x 10(-3) mu m(2) respectively. They are also characterized by tight pore-throat systems of nano- to micro-scales, with pore throat diameters in the range of 80-1800 nm, and complex pore structures. The producing reservoirs have pressure coefficients between 0.7 and 1.8, covering under-pressure to over-pressure. Crude oil properties vary greatly with densities ranging from 0.75 to 0.92 g/cm(3). It is believed that the abundance and effectiveness of hydrocarbon supply controls the formation of oil saturation, and tight oil "sweet spots" are generally in or near the areas with high hydrocarbon expulsion intensities. In addition, the quality of the source rock and the type of source reservoir control the distribution of the "sweet spots", and storage space and movable fluid guarantee the formation of the "sweet spot" area of high oil saturation. "Sweet spots" are often developed in local mini-structural highs under a broad and gentle-sloped background. Continental tight oil in China has estimated geological resource of 14.66 x 10(9) tons with a technically recoverable resource of 1.45 x 10(9) tons. Tight oil is mainly distributed in Ordos Basin, Songliao Basin, Bohai Bay Basin, Junggar Basin, and Qaidam Basin, within the Mesozoic and Cenozoic formations. Overall China has a relatively large tight oil reserve and good exploration prospect.

TI Assessment on tight oil resources in major basins in China

   Lacustrine tight oil; Genesis-Statistics Assessment Approach; Resource
   Richness Analogy Approach
AB Large-scale commercial development of shale gas and tight oil resources in North American and continuous discoveries of tight oil in China lead to the recognition of the importance of assessment on tight oil resources. Based on the characteristics of China's tight oil reservoirs and exploration status, this paper discusses a workflow focusing on in-place resource evaluation. In the workflow, a Resource-Richness Analogy Approach (RR-AA) is proposed for assessment of tight oil resources in less explored areas, a Genesis-Statistics Assessment Approach (GS-AA) for lacustrine tight oil resources with strong heterogeneity and regions where more delicate assessment is required, and an EUR Analogy Approach (EUR-AA) for assessment on recoverable tight oil by fully using available EUR data of production wells. After analyzing the geological characteristics of the formation of right oil in the Ordos, Bohai Bay, Songliao, Junggar, Sichuan and other major Basins, the distributions of essential parameters such as reservoir thickness, area and porosity have been defined, and the parameter evaluation criteria have been established. Finally, the tight oil resource potentials in the major basins in China have been evaluated using one of the three methods and the prospective areas of high resource abundance are outlined in each of basins. The results from this study show that China's tight oil resources have a large potential and good exploration future. The estimated in-place tight oil resources are 12.580 x 10(9) tons, mainly distributed in the Ordos, Songliao, Bohai Bay and Junggar Basins. 15 most favorable zones are proposed having in-place resources of 5.296 x 10(9) tons.

TI Characteristics of lacustrine dolomitic rock reservoir and accumulation

AB The Permian Fengcheng Formation in the western slope of the Mahu Sag, which is located in the Junggar Basin, NW China, has long been considered to be a high-quality source rock in this area. The lacustrine dolomitic rocks within the Fengcheng Formation has recently been reported to have a good tight oil potential as a special type of tight oil reservoir. However, the characteristics of the tight reservoir and tight oil accumulation, which are key factors for commercial development, are not well documented. We conducted a comprehensive reservoir characterization using petrological (core, thin section, scanning electron microscope, and nanoscale computed tomography) and geophysical (seismic and well logging) data. The Fengcheng Formation contains extensive dolomitic rocks deposited around the evaporite under a saline lacustrine environment accompanied by volcanic activities. The western slope of the Mahu Sag can be divided into two zones: the Wufeng Fault Zone and Fengnan Slope Zone. Dolomitic rock reservoirs and tight oil accumulation exist in both zones. Salt minerals, feldspar, calcite, and dolomite in the dolomitic rocks are susceptible to dissolution, and secondary intergranular or intragranular dissolution pores are the major reservoir spaces. Abundant nanoscale pores exist in the dolomitic rocks, but microscale pores, which dominate in volume, play a more important role. Brittle dolomitic rocks commonly develop fractures, but the Wufeng Fault Zone develops far more fault-related fractures than the Fengnan Slope Zone. The oil properties of the Wufeng Fault Zone and the Fengnan Slope Zone are also different. We propose that these two zones are two different types of tight oil accumulation plays: a fracture controlled accumulation play and a pore controlled accumulation play.

AB Fine-grained sedimentary rocks are well developed in a salinized lacustrine basin in the Junggar Basin, China. Understanding the sedimentary characteristics and process of these fine-grained sediments is essential to find the exploration target for tight oil. In this study, the sedimentary characteristics and forming mechanism of fine-grained sediments in the Permian Lucaogou Formation within the Jimsar Sag were investigated based on core and thin section observation, SEM combined with XRD and geochemical data, and eleven lithofacies were identified, including (1) brecciated dolomitic mudstone, (2) intraclastic conglomerate, (3) mixed siliciclastic and intraclastic grainstone, (4) dolomitic siltstone, (5) Carbonate packstone and grainstone, (6) dolomitic mudstone, (7) laminated algae-bearing tuffaceous mudstone, (8) massive tuffaceous mudstone, (9) turbidite dolomitic mudstone to siltstone, (10) pebbled sandstone, and (11) green mudstone and siltstone. The organic constituents in the fine-grained sedimentary rocks include sapropelic, exinite, vitrinite, inertinite and secondary macerals, which are dominated by unstructured algae and asphaltene. The fine-grained sedimentary rocks are characterized by high-frequency cycles composed of three successive facies associations: profundal, littoral-sublittoral and palustrine, which recorded distinct lacustrine expansion and contraction. Developed mud cracks, paleosols and vertical dissolution fractures in the fine-grained sedimentary rocks indicate that these facies recorded the depositional process in an ephemeral to perennial lake in an arid climate. Fluvio-deltaic and aeolian transport were main modes for transporting the siliciclastic component that ultimately accumulated in a subaqueous and subaerial environment. The dolomite in the littoral zone might develop with the evaporitic concentration of the lake water during the early diagenetic stage. The depositional processes in the profundal zone included suspension and turbidity currents. Multiphase volcanic activities affected the lithofacies and prompted the accumulation of organic matter. Understating the depositional process of the fine-grained sedimentary rocks in the Lucaogou Formation in the Jimsar Sag is helpful to understand the depositional environment in the salinized lacustrine basin in the Junggar Basin.

AB The middle Permian Lucaogou Formation (P(2)l) in the Jimusaer Sag of the southeastern Junggar Basin, NW China hosts China's first commercial tight (shale) oil production. Two tight-oil sweet spot intervals have been identified within the P(2)l formation. Coupled chemostratigraphic and sedimentary fades analysis reveals that the sweet spot intervals were deposited in deep-shallow saline lacustrine to nearshore environments under an overall dry climate setting. The sweet spot intervals in the P(2)l formation comprises several chemostratigraphically and lithologically distinct units deposited under the influence of subtle climatic and environmental changes that have previously not been recognized. A total of 11 depositional units have been identified within the two sweet spot intervals based on an Integrated Prediction Error Filter Analysis (INFEFA) of Gamma Ray logs and environmental parameters derived from chemostratigraphic data. The tight oil reservoir sweet spot intervals were found to be controlled by the spatial and temporal distribution of total organic carbon (TOC) and reservoir properties (e.g., porosity and permeability) and source-reservoir coupling. Two potential tight oil exploration plays are recognized, including those depositional units with porous reservoir beds interbedded with high-TOC source beds (a self-generation play), and those units with porous reservoir beds adjacent to high-TOC source beds (a near-source play).

AB The fact that high-quality lacustrine source rocks (generally shale and mudstone) control the formation and distribution of conventional and unconventional oil and gas reservoirs in lacustrine basins has been well-accepted in petroleum exploration and exploitation. Taking the Chang 7 lacustrine source rocks in the Ordos Basin as an example, several points having been reached are as follows. (1) The Chang 7 source rocks possess an excellent source rock potential, and the shales hold a better potential than the mudstones. (2) The paleoenvironments of the Chang 7 source rocks were sub-reducing to sub-oxidizing conditions and fresh- and brackish-water depositional environments with a maximum water depth of 150 m. The organic matter origins of the source rocks are mainly plankton, algae, bacteria and other aquatic microorganisms. (3) The beginning time of the oil generation of the Chang 7 source rocks is at 165 Ma, and the peak oil generation occurred during 115-95 Ma. The cumulative amounts of oil generation are up to 4711 x 10(3) t/km(2) and the ratios of peak generation amounts to cumulative generation amounts are > 50%. The beginning timing and peak generation timing of the shales are earlier than those of the mudstones, respectively, and the cumulative oil generation amount of the shales is higher than that of the mudstones, indicating a better oil generation potential of the shales. (4) Due to the more remained oil possessed in the shales, the hydrocarbon expulsion threshold of the Chang 7 shales (2560 m) is deeper than that of the Chang 7 mudstones (2080 m). (5) The occurrences of the Chang 8-6 tight oils are predominantly controlled by the outer boundary of the Chang 7 source rocks distribution, while the transition areas between thickness, TOC, and R 0 high value centers are the accumulation and enrichment zones. The Chang 7 shales controlled the occurrence of the Chang 8 tight oil reservoirs and the Chang 7 mudstones controlled the occurrence of the Chang 7 and Chang 6 tight oil reservoirs.

AB The Middle Permian Lucaogou Formation, in the southeastern part of the Junggar Basin in China, is a typical tight oil reservoir with low to medium porosity (average 11.2%) and ultra-low permeability (average 0.01 mD). Here, we investigate Lucaogu Formation reservoir diagenesis and its impact on reservoir quality to effectively explore, appraise, and develop this complex tight oil reservoir. Core and thin section analyses, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), electron probe analyses, fluid inclusions, isotopic analysis, pressure-controlled mercury injection, rate-controlled mercury injection, and micro-nanometer X-ray computer tomography (CT) imaging were performed on core samples from the Lucaogou tight reservoir. The sweet spots in the Lucaogu Formation are composed of siltstone, tuffaceous siltstone, and silty dolomite, which underwent two stages of carbonate cementation (primarily calcite, dolomite, and ankerite), clay mineral alteration and dissolution, and one stage of quartz cementation. The major authigenic mineral cements (derived from the original formation water, clay mineral alteration, dissolution of acid-soluble components, and the compaction and drainage of the interbedded mudstone) are also a probable source of ions. It is likely that oil emplacement occurred after quartz cementation and the first stage of carbonate cementation and feldspar dissolution, but before the second stage of calcite cementation and feldspar dissolution. Organic acids produced during hydrocarbon generation contributed to the dissolution of the feldspar and tuffaceous components, locally preventing a decrease in porosity by concurrent cementation and compaction. Carbonate cementation decreased the porosity and permeability of the silty dolomite substantially; in the siltstone, decreased permeability is largely attributed to cementation of clay minerals. The pore structure of the sweet spot is controlled not only by the various cementation events, but also by other geological factors, such as heterogeneous dissolution of the tuffaceous component.

AB Compared with the studies of nanoscale pores in shale, coal, and tight sandstone, studies associated with lacustrine tight carbonate nanoscale pores and their control mechanisms, particularly quantitative studies combining reservoir evaluation and geochemistry, remain scarce. To address this disparity, lacustrine tight carbonate samples collected from the Jurassic Da'anzhai Member in the central Sichuan Basin of China were quantitatively investigated.
   Similar to other unconventional reservoirs, lacustrine tight carbonate reservoirs contain well-developed intraparticle pores, interparticle pores, and micro-cracks with nanoscale storage spaces that dominate the full-scale reservoirs. The relatively small pores (3-5 nm) make a dominant contribution to the nanoscale storage space. Isotherms and hysteresis loops are Type II and Type H-3, respectively, indicating wedge-shaped pores. However, the hysteresis loops indicate more dead-end pores, larger pores, and more complex microstructures than those found in other unconventional reservoirs.
   The mineral in lacustrine carbonate provides a link between the reservoir and the formation environment. Strong paleo-weathering, low salinity, a humid (rainy) paleo-climate and poor hydrodynamic conditions are favorable to improve the storage spaces and terrestrial mineral contents but harmful to the formation of authigenic minerals. Terrestrial minerals, including primarily quartz, clay, and dolomite, have well-developed nanoscale pores and are positively correlated with the nanoscale storage space, whereas authigenic minerals, primarily calcite, have strong cementation and filling effects and are negatively correlated with the nanoscale storage space.

AB Oil accumulation, being difficult and complicated, is an important issue in petroleum exploration researches. Authigenic minerals, such as carbonate cements and chlorite, can in certain reservoirs alter the wettability of some pore spaces from water-wet to oil-wet. Generally, these oil-wet pore spaces are favorable for oil accumulation. The alteration of reservoir wettability induced by authigenic minerals and the impacts on oil accumulation in tight sandstone reservoirs were investigated using a suite of mineralogical and geochemical characterization techniques, including thin section observation, SEM-EDS, XRD, QEMSEM, CL, quantitative grain fluorescence (QGF), fluorescence spectral analysis, contact angle measurement and sealed coring oil saturation testing on the fourth member of the Lower Cretaceous Quantou Formation (K(1)q(4)) in the southern Songliao Basin, China. The study shows that the tight sandstone reservoirs are compositionally immature with detrital grains distributed homogeneously. Quartz, carbonates and clay minerals that show heterogeneous distribution characteristics are the major authigenic minerals in some parts of the intergranular pores. The detrital mineral assemblage suggests that the reservoir rocks at deposition and before diagenesis had characterized by strong water-wet properties. With the development of authigenic minerals, carbonate cements and authigenic chlorite tend to alter the wettability of some parts of the existing pore spaces from water-wet to oil-wet. In the K(1)q(4) sandstone reservoirs, oil prefers to accumulate in the cemented residual pore spaces around carbonate cements and chlorite. Reservoirs containing about 4-5% carbonate cements are suggested to be more preferable to oil accumulation. These reservoirs are mainly located between sandstone-mudstone interfaces and central parts of the sand bodies. Chlorites have mainly two effects: on one hand, chlorite alters the wettability of existing pore spaces and provides preferential accumulation sites for oil in the tight sandstone reservoirs, on the other hand it can reduce the adhesion of oil through forming "clay-oil flocs" and promote further migration. Consequently, the reservoirs with moderate amount of carbonate cements or chlorite always show relative high oil saturation in the K(1)q(4) tight sandstones.

AB The heterogeneous pore space of porous media strongly affects the storage and migration of oil and gas in the reservoir. To accurately reproduce complex pore structure validated with experiment data, a hybrid method which combines the CCSIM-TSS method (the cross correlation based simulation-three step sampling method) with the optimization method is proposed to reconstruct stochastically 3D models of the heterogeneous porous media based on 2D images and some constrain conditions. Moreover, the new system in the hybrid method is generated by exchanging the objective points and boundary points of pore and matrix based on two algorithms. Then the hybrid method are tested on the two typical samples (carbonate rock, tight sandstone samples with micro-nanopores). Quantitative comparison is made by computing various statistical and petrophysical properties for the reconstructed models, as well as the original samples. It was found that the hybrid method generates an ensemble of stochastic realization that honor the constrain conditions (permeability data, pore-size distributions and the connectivity). Generating realization of tight sandstones that match the experimental data based on 2D SEM image shows that this method may be then used for more accurate characterization of tight sandstones oil reservoir and analysis of their pore network.

AB Pore network modeling and physical experiments were employed to understand the migration and accumulation of tight oil in the Lucaogou Formation of the Jimsar Sag, Junggar Basin, China. The pore structure characteristics of tight rock samples were statistically analyzed, from which some representative network models were constructed. The estimated petrophysical properties of these networks, e.g., porosity, permeability, and pore/throat size distribution, agree well with those obtained from experiments, which justified the effectiveness of our models. The experiments and simulations of oil migration into tight rocks suggest that there are mainly two different types of accumulation patterns, i.e., rapid growth pattern and consistent growth pattern, which are characterized by S-shaped and modified S-shaped correlations of oil saturation and pressure gradient, respectively. Oil accumulation mainly occurs in the middle stage; however, the increment of oil saturation of consistent growth pattern is much slower than that of rapid growth pattern. The water-oil relative permeability curves, which describe the fluid transport capabilities during oil migration, were also computed from simulations. The effects of coordination number, aspect ratio, as well as clay volume were analyzed. Results show that a core sample having better connectivity and more homogeneous pores and throats facilitates the oil migration; however, a higher clay volume impedes oil accumulation and decreases the final oil saturation. This work not only provides a better understanding of tight oil accumulation mechanisms, but also supplies an alternative avenue to study multiphase flow in tight rocks.

AB Tight oil exploration and development in the Jimusar Sag of southeastern Junggar Basin of Northwest China has led to development of two reservoir segments in the Lucaogou Formation. The upper segment is mostly carbonate rocks, while the lower segment consists mainly of fine-grained clastic rocks. Both segments are mixed with clay, sand, and dolomite, which makes it difficult to identify the lithology and predict the porosity using a traditional seismic rock physics template (RPT). We analyzed the trends of ultrasonic P-wave impedance and Vp/Vs of laboratory data changing with lithology, porosity, and total organic carbon (TOC) content. Our data provide parametric sensitivity regarding porosity and TOC content by use of a bi-material-matrix-double-inclusion concentration model. We propose a modified RPT of P-wave impedance versus Vp/Vs with three end members (sandstone, dolostone, and mudstone) to predict porosity and lithology of reservoirs. We also present a new RPT of density versus Poisson ratio with the same three end members to predict TOC content and lithology of source rocks. These were validated by comparisons with laboratory measurements and log data. We inverted the porosity, TOC content, and thickness of the upper reservoir segment in the Lucaogou Formation of the J17 work area of Jimusar Sag by using the new RPT quantitative prediction method. The inversion results were identical to oil testing results, supporting the viability and effectiveness of the new RPTs.

AB Significant quantities of tight gas resources have been discovered in the Upper Paleozoic interval in the Ordos Basin, central China. The gas is believed to have been derived primarily from the Upper Paleozoic coal, mudstone and limestone source rocks. An integrated organic geochemistry and basin modeling approach was applied to quantitatively evaluate gas generation from the three types of source rocks. Source-specific gas generation kinetics were first established on the basis of sealed gold tube pyrolysis experiments. Gas generation was then modeled in 1D and 3D using the source-specific kinetics obtained. The results show that (1) near the depositional and thermal center (e.g., Well ZT-1), gas generation occurred much earlier and was greater than that of the Sh-360 well, which is away from the depositional and thermal center; (2) C-2-C-5 gases in the ZT-1 well underwent thermal cracking, while gases in the Sh-360 well did not experience any secondary thermal alteration; (3) hydrocarbon gases were mainly generated during the Early Cretaceous (135-96 Ma) and the Late Jurassic (161-135 Ma); (4) the cumulative amounts of gas generation from the coal, mudstone and limestone source rocks are 147.23 x 10(12), 57.85 x 10(12) and 12.73 x 10(12)m(3), respectively, with coal seams being a major contributor (about 67.6%) to the Upper Paleozoic gas system, followed by the mudstone (about 26.6%) and limestone (about 5.8%). By comparing with previous work and a default kinetics basin model, our source-specific kinetics basin model is more suitable for simulating gas generation in the Upper Paleozoic source rocks within the Ordos Basin.

AB Biogenic sulfide (BS) in anaerobic digesters was previously suggested to mitigate the potential impacts of metallic nanoparticles (M-NPs) on antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) propagation by sulfidation of the M-NPs. In this study, a new role of BS in regulating ARGs responses to M-NPs is reported. It was observed that CuO NPs at environmentally relevant level had no significant effects on the spread of ARGs. However, higher dosage (50 mg/gTSS) contributed to the propagation of ARGs, whose abundances would be effectively reduced by 74-115% if BS production was stimulated. Instead, introduction of EDTA, a metal ion chelator, resulted in much lower attenuation efficiencies (12-40%), indicating that restriction of the bioavailability of CuO NPs might not be the only reason for the buffering of ARG responses in the presence of BS. Further investigation showed that the presence of BS together with activation of key enzymes (O-acetyl serine sulfhydrylase and gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase) supplied and favored the biosynthesis and transformation of cysteine, which mitigated the oxidative stress induced by CuO NPs. Moreover, the amounts of cysteine and its metabolite glutathione in sludge were associated with the abundances of ARGs negatively, implying that in situ generated cysteine was the important ARGs regulator. Exploration of possible mechanisms revealed that the biosynthesized cysteine might limit gene transfer potential via mobile genetic elements, as cysteine restricted the abundances of intl 1, Tn916/1545 and ISCR 1. In addition, the cysteine remarkably alleviated the copper stress and copper resistance, which in turn blocked possible co-selection between copper and antibiotic resistance. This work provides new insight into attenuation of the bio-effects of NPs in digesters. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The widespread of water borne antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) represents a growing threat to the health of millions of people. Our study detected the relative abundances of 10 ARG subtypes in the Shanghai river network, where the major ARG components were strB, still, and ermB. These ARGs were significantly enriched by the combined sewage, tail water from urban wastewater treatment plant and runoff from agricultural areas, which reached the Suzhou (SZ), Dianpu (DP), and Huangpu (HP) River, respectively (one-way ANOVA, P < 0.01). The target ARGs were distributed in varying patterns across different rivers. bla(CTX-M) and bla(TEM) contributed to the increase of total ARGs in the rivers influenced by urban sources, particularly in the SZ River, whose distribution of ARGs was significantly related to that of the confluence of the whole river network (Mantel test, P < 0.01). The bacterial community was closely structured with ARGs and potential pathogenic bacteria's association with target ARGs became significant in downstream samples (Procrustes test, P = 0.03). Water near urban wastewater fallouts was observed to have the highest content of intl1 in the DP River, whose downstream samples' intl -ARG relationship fitted the same regression model as that of the network confluence (R = 0.84, P < 0.001). The amelioration of river water quality does not reduce ARGs, but may affect their distributional patterns in the river network in Shanghai. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Explosives used in mining operations release reactive nitrogen (N) that discharge into surrounding waters. Existing pond systems at mine sites could be used for N removal through denitrification and we investigated capacity in tailings and clarification pond sediments at an iron-ore mine site. Despite differences in microbial community structure in the two ponds, the potential denitrification rates were similar, although carbon limited. Therefore, a microcosm experiment in which we amended sediment from the clarification pond with acetate, cellulose or green algae as possible carbon sources was conducted during 10 weeks under denitrifying conditions. Algae and acetate treatments showed efficient nitrate removal and increased potential denitrification rates, whereas cellulose was not different from the control. Denitrifiers were overall more abundant than bacteria performing dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) or anaerobic ammonium oxidation, although DNRA bacteria increased in the algae treatment and this coincided with accumulation of ammonium. The algae addition also caused higher emissions of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). The bacterial community in this treatment had a large proportion of Bacteroidia, sulfate reducing taxa and bacteria known as fermenters. Functional gene abundances indicated an imbalance between organisms that produce N2O in relation to those that can reduce it, with the algae treatment showing the lowest relative capacity for N2O reduction. These findings show that pond sediments have the potential to contribute to mitigating nitrate levels in water from mining industry, but it is important to consider the type of carbon supply as it affects the community composition, which in turn can lead to unwanted processes and increased greenhouse gas emissions.

AB According to the Dutch Drinking Water Act of 2011, Dutch drinking water suppliers must conduct a Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (QMRA) for infection by the following index pathogens: enterovirus, Campylobacter, Cryptosporidium and Giardia at least once every four years in order to assess the microbial safety of drinking water. The health-based target for safe drinking water is set at less than one infection per 10 000 persons per year. At Evides Water Company, concern has arisen whether their drinking water treatment, mainly based on UV inactivation and chlorine dioxide, reduces levels of adenovirus (AdV) sufficiently. The main objective was, therefore, to conduct a QMRA for AdV. Estimates of the MV concentrations in source water were based on enumeration of total AdV by integrated cell culture PCR (iccPCR), most probable number PCR (mpnPCR) and quantitative PCR (qPCR), and on enumeration of AdV40/41 by mpnPCR and qPCR. AdV40/41 represents a large fraction of total AdV and only a small fraction of AdV is infectious (1/1700). By comparison of literature data and plant scale data, somatic coliphages appeared a good, conservative indicator for AdV disinfection by UV irradiation. Similarly, bacteriophage MS2 appeared to be a good, conservative indicator for disinfection by chlorine dioxide. Literature data on the efficiency of chlorine dioxide disinfection were fitted with the extended HOM model. Chlorine dioxide disinfection at low initial concentrations (0.05-0.1 mg/l) was found to be the major treatment step, providing sufficient treatment on its own for compliance with the health based target. UV disinfection of AdV at 40 mJ/cm(2) or 73 mJ/cm(2) was insufficient without chlorine dioxide disinfection. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Receiving water quality simulation in highly urbanised areas requires the integration of several processes occurring at different space-time scales. These integrated catchment models deliver results with a significant uncertainty level associated. Still, uncertainty analysis is seldom applied in practice and the relative contribution of the individual model elements is poorly understood. Often the available methods are applied to relatively small systems or individual sub-systems, due to limitations in organisational and computational resources. Consequently this work presents an uncertainty propagation and decomposition scheme of an integrated water quality modelling study for the evaluation of dissolved oxygen dynamics in a large-scale urbanised river catchment in the Netherlands. Forward propagation of the measured and elicited uncertainty input-parametric distributions was proposed and contrasted with monitoring data series. Prior ranges for river water quality-quantity parameters lead to high uncertainty in dissolved oxygen predictions, thus the need for formal calibration to adapt to the local dynamics is highlighted. After inferring the river process parameters with system measurements of flow and dissolved oxygen, combined sewer overflow pollution loads became the dominant uncertainty source along with rainfall variability. As a result, insights gained in this paper can help in planning and directing further monitoring and modelling efforts in the system. When comparing these modelling results to existing national guidelines it is shown that the commonly used concentration-duration-frequency tables should not be the only metric used to select mitigation alternatives and may need to be adapted in order to cope with uncertainties.

AB Differential UV absorbance (Delta A) is an important indicator that could allow operators and utility managers to routinely monitor disinfection by-product (DBP) concentrations, even in real-time applications, without the limitations of regulatory sampling and analyses. While determination coefficients between differential UV absorbance at a single wavelength (often 272 nm) and chlorination DBP concentrations are usually very high (R-2 > 0,90), the fitting parameters of these relationships vary from one water source to another, or vary within the same water source depending on the time of year. The objectives of this study are to apply multiple regression models to a rich database of Delta A and DBPs (trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAM)) that was generated from lab experiments using multiple waters with low bromide concentrations, in order to identify wavelengths that improve the applicability of DBP-Delta A relationships, as well as develop a widely applicable multi-wavelength DBP-Delta A relationship. The results show that using Delta A at two wavelengths, in addition to initial absorbance (A) at one wavelength, greatly improves the determination coefficients of the relationships, when compared with the best possible single-wavelength relationships. The significant predictors identified are A270, Delta A270 and Delta A425 for THMs; A255, Delta A255 and Delta A425 for DCAA; A250, Delta A250 and Delta A425 for TCAA; and A250, Delta A250 and Delta A425 for HAA6. This paper also discusses the applicability of the models developed for predicting DBPs in treatment plants and drinking water, as well as their limitations and the required future research to improve their performance.

AB Treated wastewater discharged into the environment acts as a disturbance of the natural microbial communities in terms of taxonomic composition and of functional gene pool, including antibiotic resistance genes. We tested whether stochastic and heterogeneous site-specific trajectories or generalities, potentially driven by deterministic processes, control the fate of allochthonous bacteria from anthropogenic sources and the persistence of their functional traits in freshwater. Finding generalities would allow the identification of wastewater treatments that could be effective in abating determinants of antibiotic resistance, We analysed the short-term response of native bacterial communities in waters exposed to the disturbance of wastewater at different dilutions, using a metagenomic approach that revealed both microbial community composition and the scope and abundance of the resistome that can pose indirect risks to human health. We found that the taxonomic composition of the communities after the disturbance was driven by case-specific stochastic processes, whereas the resistome had a deterministic trajectory, rapidly stabilising its functional traits with higher proportions of wastewater effluents, regardless of differences in taxonomic composition, richness of antibiotic resistance genes and of bacterial taxa, phenotypic features of the bacterial communities, and type of wastewater treatment. The observed deterministic proliferation of resistomes in freshwater bodies receiving wastewater effluents, suggests that this process may contribute to the global propagation of antibiotic resistance, and thus calls for new legislations promoting alternative tertiary treatments for the wastewater reuse, and targeting bacterial functional traits and not only bacterial abundances.

AB We have investigated the suitability of phosphate addition, in the form MH2PO4 (M = Na+, K+ or NH4+), for the selective removal of uranium from a complex waste effluent. The effluent in question is generated as part of a treatment strategy for a spent uranium catalyst, used in the production of acrylonitrile (Sohio process), which has been in temporary storage in Korea since 2004. Both pH (3.0-11.0) and phosphate dosages (0.25-10 mM) have been screened to identify the optimal conditions of 6.25 and 1 mM, respectively, for an initial uranium concentration of 0.16 mM. Precipitation kinetics have been investigated revealing the rapid removal of uranium from solution, with 30 min found to be optimal. The effluent was effectively decontaminated via Meta-ankoleite (K(UO2)(PO4)center dot 3H(2)O) formation to uranium levels below the Korean release limit of 1 ppm for uranium-bearing liquid wastes, with KH2PO4 addition being chosen for the real process. Final decontamination factors of the order of >= 8000 were readily achieved. Aluminium, calcium and iron containing coagulants were screened for the clean-up of the remaining supernatant, post-uranium removal, ensuring the final effluent meets the relevant release criteria (pH, total suspended solids, total phosphate and turbidity) for general, non-radioactive, effluents. A process scheme is presented and discussed for adaptation to similar uranium containing effluents. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study discovered a strong correlation between the autoinducer-2 (AI-2)-mediated quorum sensing (QS) with the performance of a submerged anaerobic membrane bioreactor during its recovery from a pentachlorophenol (PCP) shock: a decrease in AI-2 levels coincided with a reduction in volatile fatty acid concentrations, and corresponded significantly to a decrease in the relative abundance of Firmicutes, and to an increase in the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes and Synergistetes. Further batch experiments with the addition of an AI-2-regulating Escherichia coli mutant culture showed that a reduction in AI-2 levels resulted in the highest biogas production rate during a PCP shock. In contrast, an increase in AI-2 levels via addition of the E. coli wild type strain or an AI-2 precursor showed no obvious effects on biogas production. These results suggest that the AI-2 level in anaerobic sludge was governed primarily by Firmicutes, and the AI-2-mediated QS partially regulates the toxic shock response of anaerobic sludge via tuning the activities of Firmicutes and Synergistetes. A decrease in the AI-2 level might reduce aceto-genesis and favor hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis, thus resulting in less VFA accumulation and higher methane production during the PCP shock. This study is the first of this type that exploits the role of quorum sensing in the toxic shock response of anaerobic sludge: it demonstrates a novel approach to shortening the recovery period of anaerobic processes via manipulating the AI-2-mediated QS.

AB Industrial thiocyanate (SCN-) waste streams from gold mining and coal coking have polluted environments worldwide. Modern SCN- bioremediation involves use of complex engineered heterotrophic microbiomes; little attention has been given to the ability of a simple environmental autotrophic microbiome to biodegrade SDI-. Here we present results from a bioreactor experiment inoculated with SCN- -loaded mine tailings, incubated autotrophically, and subjected to a range of environmentally relevant conditions. Genome-resolved metagenomics revealed that SCN- hydrolase-encoding, sulphur oxidizing autotrophic bacteria mediated SCN- degradation. These microbes supported metabolically dependent non-SCN--degrading sulphur-oxidizing autotrophs and non-sulphur oxidizing heterotrophs, and "niche" microbiomes developed spatially (planktonic versus sessile) and temporally (across changing environmental parameters). Bioreactor microbiome structures changed significantly with increasing temperature, shifting from Thiobacilli to a novel SCN- hydrolase-encoding gammaproteobacteria. Transformation of carbonyl sulphide (COS), a key intermediate in global biogeochemical sulphur cycling, was mediated by plasmid-hosted CS2 and COS hydrolase genes associated with Thiobacillus, revealing a potential for horizontal transfer of this function. Our work shows that simple native autotrophic microbiomes from mine tailings can be employed for SCN- bioremediation, thus improving the recycling of ore processing waters and reducing the hydrological footprint of mining.

AB The export of organic carbon export by the rivers to the oceans either as particulate organic carbon (POC) or dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is very sensitive to climate change especially in permafrost affected catchments where soils are very rich in organic carbon. With global warming, organic carbon export in both forms is expected to increase in Arctic regions. It should affect contemporary biogeochemical cycles in rivers and oceans and therefore modify the whole food web. This study tries to understand complex processes involved in sediment, POC and DOC riverine transport in the Yenisei River basin and to quantify their respective fluxes at the river outlet. The SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) hydrological model is used in this study to simulate water and suspended sediment transfers in the largest Arctic river. POC and DOC export have been quantified with empirical models, adapted from literature for the study case. First, the hydrological model has been calibrated and validated at a daily time step for the 2003-2008 and the 2009-2016 periods respectively, and its output has been compared with field data for water and sediment fluxes. Based on conceptualization of transfer processes, calibration on climate and soil properties has been performed in order to correctly represent hydrology and sediment transfer in permafrost basins. Second, calibration of empirical models for DOC/POC transport have been performed by comparing their output with field data, available from 2003 to 2016. Our study reveals that SWAT is capable of correctly representing hydrology, sediment transfer, POC and DOC fluxes and their spatial distribution at a daily timescale, and outlines the links between these fluxes and permafrost features. Our simulation effort results in specific sediment, POC and DOC fluxes of 2.97 t km(-2) yr(-1), 0.13 t km(-2) yr(-1) and 1.14 t km(-2) yr(-1) for the period 2003-2016 which are in the range of previous estimates. About 60% of the total fluxes of sediment, DOC and POC to the Arctic Ocean are exported during the two months of the freshet. Spatial analysis show that permafrost-free areas have returned higher daily organic carbon export than permafrost affected zones, highlighting the thawing permafrost effect on carbon cycle in climate change feedback.

AB Increased loading of algal organic matter (AOM) during harmful algal blooms not only burdens water treatment processes but also challenges safe drinking water delivery. While organic constituents promote biofilm growth in drinking water distribution systems (DWDS), the effects of AOM on biofilm formation in DWDS are not well understood. Herein, three parallel biofilm reactors were used to assess and compare how treated AOM- and humic substance (HS)-impacted bulk water, and R2A medium (a control) affect biofilm development for 168 days. The 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis revealed that the bacterial communities in biofilms were clustered with the organic matter types in bulk water, where Family Comamonadaceae was the most dominant but showed different temporal dynamics depending on the organic matter characteristics in bulk water. Higher diversity was observed in the biofilms grown in AOM-impacted bulk water (BFAOM) than biofilms grown in HS -impacted (BFHS) and R2A-impacted bulk water (BFR2A) as the biofilms matured. In addition, some taxa (e.g., Rhodobacteraceae and Sphingomonadaceae) were enriched in BFAOM compared to BFHS and BFR2A. The biofilm image analysis results indicated that compared to BFHS, BFAOM and BFR2A had relatively thinner and heterogeneous physical structures with lower amounts of cell biomass, extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), and higher EPS protein/polysaccharide ratios. Overall, this study revealed how AOM- and HS-impacted bulk water shape the physiochemical and community structures of biofilms, which can provide insights into assessing biofilm-associated risks and optimizing disinfection practices for biofilm control in DWDS.

AB A trichloroethene (TCE)-dechlorinating community (CANAS) maintained in a completely mixed flow reactor was established from a semi-batch enrichment culture (ANAS) and was monitored for 400 days at a low solids retention time (SRT) under electron acceptor limitation. Around 85% of TCE supplied to CANAS (0.13 mmol d(-1)) was converted to ethene at a rate of 0.1 mmol d(-1), with detection of low production rates of vinyl chloride (6.8 x 10(-3) mmol d(-1)) and cis-dichloroethene (2.3 x 10(-3) mmol d(-1)). Two distinct Dehalococcoides mccartyi strains (ANAS1 and ANAS2) were stably maintained at 6.2 +/- 2.8 x 10(8) cells mL(-1) and 5.8 +/- 1.2 x 10(8) cells mL(-1), respectively. Electron balance analysis showed 107% electron recovery, in which 6.1% were involved in dechlorination. 16 S rRNA amplicon sequencing revealed a structural regime shift between ANAS and CANAS while maintaining robust TCE dechlorination due to similar relative abundances of D. mccartyi and functional redundancy among each functional guild supporting D. mccartyi activity. D. mccartyi transcriptomic analysis identified the genes encoding for ribosomal RNA and the reductive dehalogenases tceA and vcrA as the most expressed genes in CANAS, while hup and vhu were the most critical hydrogenases utilized by D. mccartyi in the community.

DT Editorial Material
DE Virtual water hypothesis; Economic theory of comparative advantage;
   Input-output model of inter-regional trade
AB The virtual water hypothesis offers the reasonable proposition that if water-abundant regions export water-intensive products to water-scarce regions, the latter could devote their scarce resources instead to uses yielding higher economic returns. Zhao et al. show that trade flows in China do not adhere to this hypothesis, use the economic theory of comparative advantage to explore why, and seek a solution where both the hypothesis and the theory are apparently satisfied. However, they have not fully utilized the power of the theory: this is made evident by the fact that their calculations quantify what they call "the comparative advantage of land, labor and water," as stated in the title of the article. This Comment describes the significance of comparative advantage for this inquiry and our comparable investigation for the regions of Mexico. It concludes with the case for a collaborative effort to situate such single-country studies in the context of a model of global comparative advantages. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The paper reports on the development of an advanced Lagrangian particle tracking model of sludge flocs that takes into account its nonspherical shape, the internal porosity and permeability, as well as the nonhomogenous mass distribution. The floc shapes, sizes and free settling velocities are determined based on the experimental measurement of settling sludge flocs originating from a wastewater treatment plant. Based on the floc shape characterization, a prolate axisymmetric ellipsoid is selected as the modelled sludge particle. In order to determine the main particle characteristics, e.g. the internal porosity, the density and the flow permeability, a Lagrangian particle tracking model is developed based on Brenner's drag model for a prolate axisymmetric ellipsoid and a buoyancy force model for a porous particle. The model is implemented for numerical simulations of the free settling process. The obtained floc characteristics are presented in the form of a two-part polynomial fitting curve, which can be used to model floc characteristics. The values of settling velocities of flocs computed by the model show very good agreement with experimental results. Futhermore, as the internal structure of a floc is seldom uniform, the nonhomogeneous mass distribution is considered, influencing the rotational and translational motions of the settling flocs. The nonhomogeneous mass distribution is introduced into the floc settling model. The parametric analyses of different barycentre offsets and shear rates are performed, and their influences on the free settling velocity are evaluated. The presented modelling approach can also be applied to flocculent settling of alum and other flocs in drinking water treatment plants. The developed Lagrangian model is suitable for use as a point source within the framework of Eulerian flow computations, and is solved as a two-phase flow model with a suitable Computational Fluid Dynamics code.

AB High concentration of Cu2+ in swine wastewater raises concerns about its potential adverse effects on nutrient removal by aquatic plants like duckweed. In this work, the effects of copper ions on nutrient removal and release of dissolved organic matter (DOM) were investigated in duckweed systems. Results showed that the removal performance of ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) and total phosphorus (TP) increased at 0.1-1.0 mg/L of Cu2+, while dropped at 2.0-5.0 mg/L of Cu2+. A novel kinetic model in which Cu2+ was taken into account was then developed which was used to optimize Cu2+ concentration at 0.96 mg/L for nutrient removal in duckweed systems. NADH, detected in DOM by the parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis, exhibited high capacities of binding copper ions, so it played an important role on the decrease of Cu2+ concentrations in duckweed systems. The principle component analysis (PCA) showed that the dominant DOM were lower molecular weight compounds at 1.0 mg/L of Cu2+ and higher molecular weight compounds at 2.0-5.0 mg/L of Cu2+. The bonds of C-H (humic-like), N=0 (NO3-) and Ar-H (tyrosine) in DOM were responsible for not only the fastest binding with Cu2+ from the result of the two-dimensional Fourier transform infrared correlation spectroscopy (2D-FTIR-CoS) but also the variations of DOM conformations at a critical concentration of 0.5 mg/L Cu2+ from the perturbation correlation moving window two-dimensional (PCMW2D) analysis. These findings lead to a better understanding on the environmental behaviors and mechanisms of Cu2+ in duckweed systems. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Desalination and water reuse are important means to resolve local water scarcity and security issues worldwide where membrane distillation (MD) may be part of a solution. Natural organic matter and in particular, humic acids (HA), are widely present in water supplies to be treated but exhibit little understood behavior to diffuse through MD membranes into permeate. In this work, air gap (AGMD) and water gap (WGMD) were utilized to study HA behavior in MD using seawater and synthetic water over a range of typical MD temperatures, flow rates and membrane types. HA diffusion was first shown with seawater feed then on synthetic solutions at all process conditions. While electrical conductivity rejection was always above than 99%, HA rejection showed values of 33% and 90% for AGMD and 68% and 93% for WGMD with seawater and synthetic water, respectively. Analytical techniques were used to perform a preliminary organic matter characterization in permeate, obtaining clear differences between the feed and permeate HA property. Compared to hydrophobic membranes, uniquely oleophobic membranes inhibit HA diffusion suggesting hydrophobic surface diffusion of HA through the membrane. HA flux as well as potential undesirable effects of the organic matter in permeate should be considered for MD applications. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Infections with Staphylococcus aureus are being spread through contact with the community environment, but the role of wastewater treatment plants in the transmission routes is not defined. This study investigated the prevalence, types, genetic elements, and potential for transmission of S. aureus by these engineered systems. Synchronized sampling events at two wastewater treatment plants were conducted with isolates of S. aureus obtained by a selective enrichment method using acriflavine that suppressed Staphylococcus epidermidis growth. DNA was extracted from a subset of the S. aureus isolates, checked by PCR to assure the absence of S. epidermidis, and sequenced to determine the multilocus sequence type, spa type, and carriage of the methicillin resistance and Panton-Valentine leukocidin genetic elements. Sequences were analyzed for single nucleotide polymorphism differences in pairwise comparison of isolates. There were two dominant S. aureus clonal complexes identified in the isolates, one commonly identified as hospital-related (CC5) and one community-related (CC8). Both types of isolates were found at both treatment facilities, even though only one facility had significant hospital sewage inputs. The presence of S. aureus persisted through treatment, with some isolates recovered from the final processes showing genetic diversity. The presence of the Panton-Valentine leukocidin genetic element was greater than the 1-5% expected from global reports. Our results suggest that treatment provides an opportunity for genetic shift, while the persistence and release of evolved strains of S. aureus may provide an environmentally relevant pathway to new hosts in the environment.

AB Gallium (Ga) is a critical element in developing renewable energy generation and energy efficient systems. The supply of Ga is at risk and needed recycling technologies for its availability in future. This study demonstrated the recovery of Ga3+ from low gallium concentrated wafer fabrication industry wastewaters using the siderophores desferrioxamine B (DFOB) and desferrioxamine E (DFOE). The complexation of Ga3+ by DFOB and DFOE was through hydroxamate group as demonstrated by infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance and density functional theory calculations. The high selectivity of DFOB/E towards Ga3+ was observed due to the formation of highly stable complex. Indeed, due to the formation of such high stability complex, the DFOB and DFOE were able to successfully complex 100% Ga in the two different process water from wafer fabrication industry. For the recovery of the siderophores, a high rate of decomplexation of Ga (>90%) was achieved upon addition of 6 times excess of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) at pH of 3.5. More than 95% of Ga-DFOB and Ga-DFOE complex were recovered with purity (% of Ga moles in comparison to total moles of metals) of 69.8 and 92.9%, respectively by application of a C18 reversed-phase chromatography column. This study, for the first time, demonstrated a technical solution to the recovery of Ga3+ from the low concentrated wastewater based on siderophores and reversed-phase chromatography. A German patent application had been filed for this technology. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this study, ultraviolet based advanced oxidation processes (UV-AOPs) including UV/persulfate (UV/PS), UV/chlorine, and UV/H2O2 were employed to alleviate ultrafiltration membrane fouling during the treatment of algae-laden water. The results show that UV/PS pretreatment exhibited the best performance on fouling control, followed by the UV/H2O2 pretreatment. The fouling mitigation performance improved with the increase of oxidant dose. However, UV/chlorine pretreatment aggravated membrane fouling, and the irreversible fouling resistance increased by five times compared with that of raw water. The dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the algae-laden solution was reduced after UV/PS pretreatment, while either UV/chlorine or UV/H2O2 pretreatment had little influence on the DOC of feed water, UV/PS and UV/H2O2 pretreatments were effective in the degradation of fluorescent compounds, thus reducing the deposition of organic matter on the membrane surface. Additionally, the decreased concentration of hydrophobic organics, algal cells, and debris in feed water after UV/PS pretreatment was also contributed to the fouling alleviation. The aggravated irreversible fouling after UV/chlorine pretreatment was probably ascribed to the increased accumulation of hydrophobic fractions in the membrane pores. Modeling result indicates that membrane fouling during the filtration of raw algae-laden water was dominated by intermediate blocking and cake filtration mechanisms. Both UV/PS and UV/H2O2 pre-treatments transformed the combined fouling mechanism into standard blocking, while UV/chlorine pretreatment aggravated the pore blocking in the initial filtration period.

TI Control wildfire-induced Microcystis aeruginosa blooms by copper

AB Elevated levels of nutrients due to wildfire ash input into stream waters will likely cause algal blooms. When source water is impeded by algae and requires immediate restoration, copper algaecides are usually applied. Previous studies indicate that Cu2+ can promote reactivity of dissolved organic matter in forming disinfection byproducts (DBPs). However, it is unclear that how DBP formation is changed after the treatment of post-fire algal bloom by copper algaecide. In this study Microcystis aeruginosa was cultured in the medium containing black and white ash water extracts (BE and WE) to study DBP concentrations before and after 4-days exposures to low and high copper sulfate (0.5 and 1.0 mg-Cu/L). Dissolved organic matter (DOM) was characterized by UV-VIS absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy and chlorination/chloramination-based DBP formation potential (FP) experiments. DOM concentrations and algal population in the treatments were lower than that in control, regardless of types of water extract. N-nitrosodimethylamine FP in the treatments were 4-6 times higher than the control (0.23-0.34 vs. 0.05-0.06 mu g/L), while haloacetonitrile FP revealed no significant difference (132-191 vs. 167-185 mu g/L). Trade-offs between reducing algal population and promoting DBP-FP were more pronounced for the solutions containing BE than WE. Low copper concentration was as effective as high concentration in inhibiting algal growth while minimizing promotion of DBP formation. The results can serve to support risk evaluations of algal population and DBP concentration when wildfire-induced algal bloom is left untreated and treated by copper algaecides.

AB The UV/persulfate process is an effective advanced oxidation process (AOP) for the abatement of a variety of micropollutants via producing sulfate radicals (SO4 center dot-). However, when this technology is used to reduce target pollutants, the precursors of disinfection byproducts (DBPs), such as natural organic matter (NOM) and organic nitrogen compounds, can be altered. This study systematically investigated the DBP formation from NOM and five model compounds after UV/H2O2 and UV/persulfate treatments followed with 24 h chlorination. Compared to chlorination alone, the yields of trichloromethane (TCM) and dichloroacetonitrile (DCAN) from NOM decreased by 50% and 54%, respectively, after UV/persulfate treatment followed with chlorination, whereas those of chloral hydrate (CH), 1,1,1-trichloropropanone (1,1,1-TCP) and trichloronitromethane (TCNM) increased by 217%, 136%, and 153%, respectively. The effect of UV/H2O2 treatment on DBP formation shared a similar trend to that of UV/persulfate treatment, but the DBP formation was higher from the former. As the UV/persulfate treatment time prolonged or the persulfate dosage increased, the formation of TCM and DCAN continuously decreased, while that of CH, 1,1,1-TCP and TCNM presented an increasing and then decreasing pattern. SO4 center dot- activated benzoic acid (BA) to form phenolic compounds that enhanced the formation of TCM and CH, while it deactivated resorcinol to decrease the formation of TCM. SO4 center dot- reacted with aliphatic amines such as methylamine (MA) and dimethylamine (DMA) to form nitro groups, which significantly increased the formation of TCNM in post chlorination, and the rate was determined to be higher than that of HO center dot. This study illuminated the diverse impacts of the structures of the precursors on DBP formation after UV/persulfate treatment, and DBP alteration depended on the reactivity between SO4 center dot- and specific precursor.

AB In this study, Fe-Zeolite-A as a phosphate adsorbent was synthesized by incorporating iron into the framework of Zeolite-A using ammonium iron citrate as the Fe(3+)source. The adsorption (in acidic condition) and desorption of phosphate (in alkaline condition) from an aqueous solution was repetitively performed for 18 times in batch test using Fe-Zeolite-A. The rate of adsorption and desorption of PO43- was much faster (consistently) than any of the reported study so far. The crystalline phase of pristine zeolite changed to amorphous after one adsorption phase and ultimately transformed into a highly amorphous phase after 18 adsorption/desorption cycles. It was due to the formation of more active sites on the surface of the zeolite by a release of atoms, breaking of bonds and deposition of metal and phosphate compounds on the surface (by rigorous acid/base treatment). Increase in active sites enhanced the sorption efficiency of Fe-Zeolite-A. With the help of microscopic and spectroscopic techniques, it was found that Fe3+, Al(3+)and Na+ metal ions of the Fe-Zeolite-A were involved in the adsorption/desorption of PO43-. Fe3+ ion exhibited ligand exchange mechanism by exchanging -OH ions with PO43-. Al(3+)and Na+ exhibited interactions like precipitation, hydrogen bonding, and diffusion respectively to adsorb PO43-. Fe3+ metal ion dominated over other metal ions by ligand exchange principle, making the sorption process a highly reversible one. The adsorbent showed quantitative adsorption/desorption capacity even after continuous 18 cycles indicating a higher level of reusability. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB A shortage of phosphate rock resources has led to a focus on the use of sewage sludge as a fertiliser. One factor preventing the unlimited application of sewage sludge in agriculture is the heavy metal content. This work looks at a process where weak acid leaching of sewage sludge would be coupled to ion exchange (IX) for heavy metal ion removal. IX offers an effective method for the recovery of these metals from a leachate. This study presents the pH performance of six selected IX resins in extracting Cu2+, Fe2+, Pb2+ and Zn2+ from acetic, lactic and citric acid media simulated weak acid leachate. Acetic acid media displayed limited suppression of metal extraction, whilst lactic and citric acid media rendered MTS9100 ineffective. Lactic acid media when combined with C107E resin allows for the targeted extraction of lead. Both MTS9570 and MTS9501 display high ferrous extraction in all media at all pH values, although citric acid hinders extraction by both resins at higher pH values. TP214 is selective for copper over all other metal ions in all weak acid media. MTS9301 is the most effective at extracting all metals from all media solutions, with separation of copper becoming more apparent when transitioning to citric acid. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Thermal disinfection is commonly used to prevent the proliferation of culturable Legionella in engineered water systems (EWS). In response to such stress, culturable Legionella populations can switch into a viable but nonculturable (VBNC) state. The importance of such VBNC Legionella cells is currently hotly debated. Here, we investigated the stress response patterns and transitions of the bacteria to the VBNC state at 55 degrees C, 60 degrees C and 70 degrees C on two L. pneumophila strains for >80 days using a combination of cell-based viability indicators. Complete loss of culturability at 55 degrees C, 60 degrees C and 70 degrees C occurred after 3-8 h, 60 min and <2 min, respectively. In contrast, L. pneumophila strains required 9 days at 55 degrees C, 8 h at 60 degrees C and 20 min at 70 degrees C to achieve a 2 log reduction in cells with intact membranes and high esterase activity; a 4 log reduction was achieved only after 150, 8-15 and 1-4 days, respectively. In parallel, the presence of diagnostic outer-membrane epitopes (OMEs) and changes in the infectivity patterns of the two strains towards amoebae and THP-1 cells were assessed. OMEs were more persistent than viability indicators, showing their potential as targets for VBNC Legionella detection. L. pneumophila strains infected amoebae and THP-1 cells for at least 85 days at 55 degrees C and 60 degrees C and for up to 8 days at 70 degrees C. However, they did so with reduced efficiency, requiring prolonged co-incubation times with the hosts and higher Legionella cell numbers in comparison to culturable cells. Consequently, infection of amoebae by thermally induced VBNC L. pneumophila with lowered virulence can be expected in EWS. Although the gold standard method cannot detect VBNC Legionella, it provides important information about the most virulent bacterial subpopulations. Our results indicate that a prolonged thermal regime >= 60 degrees C at the central parts of warm water systems is not only effective against culturable L. pneumophila but in the long run even against VBNC cells.

AB Fish kills are widespread visible events perceived by the civil society as a major cause for concern about water quality and ecosystem health. Investigations conducted so far have linked fish kills to multiple factors, but extensive studies examining quantitatively the likelihood of fish kills are missing. In the present study, factors related to fish kills in 67 Mediterranean reservoirs located in the Iberian Peninsula were investigated. Moreover, the variation in the likelihood of fish kills with the foreseen consequences of anthropogenically driven climate change upon temperature and precipitation was assessed. During the 23-year period studied (1995-2017) the number of fish kills per reservoir varied from 0 to 3 and happened mostly in Southern reservoirs and during the warmest months, particularly in June. Twelve explanatory variables showed significant differences between reservoirs with and without fish die-offs. Reservoir depth, surface area oxygen and chlorophyll a concentrations were the variables that, together, best discriminated between reservoirs with and without fish kills, explaining 67.2% of the total variation in the occurrence of fish die-offs. The variables retained in the mortality model explained unique parts of that variation, but a considerable amount of the explained variation was shared by all the variables. The number of fish kill events appears to be rising during the examined period and the projection made indicated an increase in the likelihood of fish kills towards the end of the 21st century, particularly for the RCP8.5 emission scenario, with the prevalence of fish kills reaching 0.865 in Southern reservoirs. In the future, oligotrophication is likely the only strategy to consistently reduce fish kills in Mediterranean reservoirs. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Pressure transients have been identified as one of the major contributing factors in many pipe failures in water distribution systems (WDSs). The behavior of these pressure transients is largely unknown and cannot be fully assessed by numerical simulation or modeling. This study investigates the behavior of pressure transients in WDSs as measured by high-frequency pressure sensors. A Time Series Data Mining (TSDM) approach is proposed to detect and cluster pressure transients to reveal recurrent and consistent patterns. The proposed technique, based on a modified two-sided cumulative sum (CUSUM) algorithm, is used to detect pressure transients. Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is adopted to measure the similarity between the detected pressure transients, and k-means clustering algorithm is used to discover the characteristic patterns. Several performance scores are suggested to evaluate the quality of the clustering results, including sum of squared error, Silhouette index, and Calinski-Harabaz index. Results demonstrate that the proposed approach is able to reveal consistent and unique patterns across multiple sensing locations. The proposed approach provides a fast and efficient way to discover the hidden information in WDSs by analyzing high-frequency pressure signals from distributed sensors. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB While some microbial eukaryotes can improve effluent quality in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), eukaryotic waterborne pathogens are a threat to public health. This study aimed to identify Eukarya, particularly faecal pathogens including Cryptosporidium, in different treatment stages (influent, intermediate and effluent) from four WWTPs in Western Australia (WA). Three WWTPs that utilise stabilisation ponds and one WWTP that uses activated sludge (oxidation ditch) treatment technologies were sampled. Eukaryotic 18S rRNA (18S) was targeted in the wastewater samples (n = 26) for next-generation sequencing (NGS), and a mammalian-blocking primer was used to reduce the amplification of mammalian DNA. Overall, bioinformatics analyses revealed 49 eukaryotic phyla in WWTP samples, and three of these phyla contained human intestinal parasites, which were primarily detected in the influent. These human intestinal parasites either had a low percent sequence composition or were not detected in the intermediate and effluent stages and included the amoebozoans Endolimax sp., Entamoeba sp. and Iodamoeba sp., the human pinworm Enterobius vermicularis (Nematoda), and Blastocystis sp. subtypes (Sarcomastigophora). Six Blastocystis subtypes and four Entamoeba species were identified by eukaryotic 18S NGS, however, Cryptosporidium sp. and Giardia sp. were not detected. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) also failed to detect Giardia, but Cryptosporidium-specific NGS detected Cryptosporidium in all WWTPs, and a total of nine species were identified, including five zoonotic pathogens. Although eukaryotic 18S NGS was able to identify some faecal pathogens, this study has demonstrated that more specific NGS approaches for pathogen detection are more sensitive and should be applied to future wastewater pathogen assessments.

AB Catalytic wet air oxidation (CWAO) is a clean process for the treatment of toxic and/or biorefractory contaminants while it is a challenge to perform the CWAO at room temperature. Herein, we report an electro-assisted CWAO (ECWAO) process using partially oxidized nickel (Ni@NiO) immobilized on a porous graphite felt (GF) as a catalytic anode. Such a process demonstrates extensive effectiveness and good stability in the deep oxidation of various organic pollutants including triclosan (TCS), bisphenol A, ciprofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole, congo red, crystal violent and rodamine B at room temperature. The typical pollutant TCS is rapidly degraded within 105 min with a mineralization efficiency of 86.0 +/- 1.4%, at specific energy consumption of 5.3 +/- 0.3 kW h kg-TOC-1. NiO is identified as the catalytically active site at which 02 is dissociated and electro-activated to oxidize the TCS at room temperature. The ECWAO process on the anodic Ni@NiO/GF presents a great potential as an environmental-friendly and energy saving process for treating high concentrations of refractory organic pollutants under ambient condition.

AB Water disinfection can result in the unintended formation of halogenated disinfection byproducts (DBPs), which have been the subject of intensive investigation over the past 40 years. Robust methods for evaluating and characterizing the formation of halogenated DBPs are prerequisites for ultimately controlling the formation of DBPs and ensuring quality and safe disinfected water. Only a fraction of the total organic halogen (TOX) formed during disinfection has been chemically identified or even well characterized by the classical (derivatization-)gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) method. Such a method may not be amenable to the detection of polar halogenated DBPs, which constitute a major portion of the TOX that is still unaccounted for. Accordingly, a novel precursor ion scan (PIS) method using (liquid chromatography/) electrospray ionization-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry was developed for the rapid selective detection of all polar halogenated DBPs-no matter whether the DBPs are known or unknown-in water. This article reviews recent literature on the application of the PIS method for evaluating the occurrence, formation and control of polar halogenated DBPs in disinfected waters. The challenges in developing the PIS method were briefly summarized. Application of the powerful method pinpointed >150 previously unknown DBPs and revealed the formation, speciation and transformation of halogenated DBPs in disinfected drinking water, wastewater effluents, and swimming pool water. For the same source water, positive correlations were found between the total ion intensity (111) levels in the PIS spectra of m/z 35/79/126.9 and the total organic chlorine/bromine/iodine levels in the disinfected water sample, and a disinfected sample with a higher TII level generally showed a higher toxic potency. Accordingly, the 111 value can be used as a surrogate to comparatively reflect the water quality and assess the efficiency of a DBP control approach. To achieve a more comprehensive and systematic understanding of the DBP compositions in different waters and thus better control the DBP formation and reduce their overall toxicity, topics for future-work were discussed.

AB In this paper, the removal of 2-benzylphenol (2-BP), phenol (Ph), chlorophene (CP), and 4-chlorophenol (4-CP) by Fe(VI) have been examined at pH 8.0. The second-order rate constant (k) for substrates degradation at a Fe(VI) concentration of 0.2 mM was in the order of k(CP) (353 M-1 s(-1))> k(4-CP) (131 M-1 s(-1))> k(2-BP) (102 M-1 s(-1)) > k(Ph) (40 M-1 s(-1)), indicating that the presence of chlorine and benzyl groups in benzene ring can enhance the reactivity of the phenolic compounds with Fe(VI). Reaction products were identified by a liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time-of-flight-mass spectrometry (LC-Q-TOF-MS), and four reaction mechanisms, including hydroxylation of benzene ring, cleavage of C-C bridge bond, substitution of chlorine atom by hydroxyl group, and the single-electron coupling mechanism were proposed for phenols degradation by Fe(VI). The extracted peak areas of the degradation products showed that the single-electron coupling reaction is the main degradation mechanism in Fe(VI) oxidation processes. In addition to direct attack by Fe(VI), hydroxyl radical, as detected by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra, also plays a role in phenols degradation. The center dot OH initiated reactions and single-electron coupling reactions were further explored by total charges distribution, transition state calculations and potential energy profiles. In addition, Fe(VI) could also work as a highly effective oxidant for substrates removal from real waters. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Efficient digestate dewatering is crucial to reduce the volume and transportation cost of solid residues from anaerobic digestion (AD) plants. Large variations in dewatered cake solids have been reported and predictive models are therefore important in design and operation of such plants. However, current predictive models lack validation across several digestion substrates, pre-treatments and full-scale plants. In this study, we showed that thermogravimetric analysis is a reliable prediction model for dewatered cake solids using digestates from 15 commercial full-scale plants. The tested digestates originated from different substrates, with and without the pre-AD thermal hydrolysis process (THP). Moreover, a novel combined physicochemical parameter (C/N.ash) characterizing different digestate blends was identified by multiplying the C/N ratio with ash content of the dried solids. Using samples from 22 full-scale wastewater, food waste and co-waste plants, a linear relationship was found between C/N.ash and predicted cake solids for digestates with and without pre-AD THP. Pre-AD THP improved predicted cake solids by increasing the amount of free water. However, solids characteristics like C/N ratio and ash content had a more profound influence on the predicted cake solids than pre-AD THP and type of dewatering device. Finally, C/N.ash was shown to have a linear relationship to cake solids and reported polymer dose from eight full-scale pre-AD THP plants. In conclusion, we identified the novel parameter C/N.ash which can be used to predict dewatered cake solids regardless of dewatering device and sludge origin. (C) 2019 The Authors.

AB Despite significant progress made in multiple aspects of capacitive deionization (CDI), a rational framework is in need for optimizing the design and operation of a large desalination system based on CDI. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework for guiding the design of a desalination plant based on CDI with ion exchange membranes (i.e. membrane CDI, or MCDI). This framework is established by identifying (1) the practical design constraints, (2) the inter-relationships between different design and operating parameters, (3) a set of independent variables, and (4) the key performance metrics. The proposed design framework reduces the degrees of freedom of the system and facilitates more focused and systematic analysis of the overall performance of an MCDI-based desalination plant. Careful analysis using the proposed design framework suggests the presence of an optimal tradeoff curve that comprises all the possible optima of design and operating conditions with which an MCDI-based desalination plant is the most cost-effective. We also show that the typical practice of using equal flowrates for charging and discharge yields very good performance compared to the optima, as long as water recovery is not too high. Finally, we also briefly explain the implication of this framework on cost-based optimization of the design and operation of an MCDI-based desalination plant. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Effective remediation of arsenic contaminated water remains a critical task from the environmental perspective, owing to the harmful effects of arsenic on human health and the environment. Recently, highly porous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with excellent chemical stability and abundant functional groups represent a significant new addition to the area of capturing aquatic arsenic pollutants. This review focuses on the development of MOF-based materials for the efficient removal of toxic arsenic species from aqueous solutions. Aspects related to the materials' characteristics, application performance and interaction mechanisms are systematically studied, referencing the macroscopic experimental behaviors and microscopic spectroscopy analyses. The properties of various MOF-based materials are assessed and compared with those of other conventionally used materials. At last, insights and perspectives are suggested in terms of future research directions and development challenges. Overall, this class of materials demonstrates a promising potential for aquatic arsenic removal, and with a proper up scaling development might it be used for practical applications in the near future.

AB Recently, the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) via plasmid-mediated conjugation has been reported to be facilitated by a series of contaminants. This has highlighted potential challenges to the effective control of this principal mode of horizontal transfer. In the present study, we found that low levels (<0.02 mgN/L) of free nitrous acid (FNA) remarkably inhibited (over 90%) the conjugative transfer of plasmid RP4, a model broad-host-range plasmid, between Escherichia coli. The antimicrobial role of FNA at the applied dosages was firstly ruled out, since no dramatic reductions in viabilities of donor or recipient were observed. Instead, FNA appeared to reduce the available intracellular free Mg2+, which was confirmed to be triggered by the liberation of intracellular Fe2+. These alterations in intracellular Mg2+ and Fe2+ concentrations were found to significantly limit the available energy for conjugative transfer through suppression of glycolysis by decreasing the activities of glycogen phosphorylase and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and also by diverting the glycolytic flux into the pentose phosphate pathway via activation of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase towards the generation of NADPH rather than ATP. Moreover, RP4-encoding genes responsible for DNA transfer and replication (traI, traJ and trfAp), coupling (traG) and mating pair formation (traF and trbBp) were all significantly down-regulated after FNA treatment, indicating that the transfer apparatus required for plasmid processing and delivery was deactivated. By validating the inhibitory effects of FNA on conjugation in real wastewater, this study highlights a promising method for controlling the dissemination of ARGs in systems such as wastewater treatment plants.

AB The adsorption of metals and other elements onto environmental plastics has been previously quantified and is known to be enhanced by surface-weathering and development of biofilms. However, further biofilm-adsorption characterisation is needed with respect to the fate of radionuclides. This study uses spectroscopy, microscopy and radiotracer methods to investigate the adsorption capacity of relatively strong and weak cations onto different microplastic sample types that were conditioned in freshwater, estuarine and marine conditions although marine data were limited. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy confirmed that surface oxidation chemistry changes induced by gamma irradiation were similar to those resulting from environmental exposures. Microscopy elemental mapping revealed patchy biofilm development, which contained Si, Al, and O, consistent with microbial-facilitated capture of clays. The plastics+biofilm of all sample types had measurable adsorption for Cs and Sr radiotracers, suggesting environmental plastics act broadly as a sink for the key pervasive environmental radionuclides of Cs-137 and Sr-90 associated with releases from nuclear activities. Adsorption onto high-density polyethylene plastic types was greater than that on polypropylene. However, in most cases, the adsorption rates of all types of plastic+biofilm were much lower than those of reference sediments and roughly consistent with their relative exchangeable surface areas.

AB A novel laboratory experiment of three chamber bioelectrochemical (surface water-sediment-groundwater, SSG) system was established in this study, which combined a sediment microbial fuel cell (SMFC) reactor and biofilm electrode reactor (BER) and was self-driven. Simulated groundwater was firstly used to explore the reaction mechanisms of this system. The simulated groundwater conditions were static and the surface water and the groundwater systems were isolated. The results showed that the SMFC continuously supplied a stable voltage of 622 mV +/- 20 mV, driving the BER and the related nitrate removal process. Compared to the control systems, the SSG system had higher nitrate removal with a denitrification rate of 3.87 mg N/(L.h). In addition, the sediment organic matter in the SMFC reactor decreased by 66.2%. Based on the electrochemical analysis and microbial community analysis, the SMFC reactor and BER worked synergistically to enhance the performance of both reactors in this system. The presence of microorganisms accelerated the electron transfer efficiency throughout the system, and the microcurrent helped a more fixed community structure to develop and stimulated the growth of denitrifying bacteria. The dominant genera detected in the mature biofilm samples were all microorganisms common in soil and groundwater, indicating that this system may be environmentally friendly. The nitrate removal efficiency for actual groundwater was higher than that for the simulated groundwater, indicating that the elements in the actual groundwater promote the nitrate removal efficiency. These results indicate that the SSG system has the potential for in-situ nitrate bioremediation, with minimal maintenance and health risk. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The removal of urea by persulfate with UV irradiation in an ultrapure water (UPW) production system was examined using a continuously operated column reactor. Urea is a substance that is not properly removed by the unit processes in UPW production systems. Based on our monitoring of urea concentration over 1 year of the operation of a UPW production facility, a relatively high concentration of urea was introduced between February and May in 2016 and the total organic carbon (TOC) concentration of the UPW was increased in that period. Approximately 50% of the urea in the raw water was removed by the UPW production process, for which double-pass reverse osmosis units were instrumental. The addition of persulfate to the TOC reduction UV unit in the UPW production process was examined to improve the efficiency of urea removal. As a result, supplying over 20 mu mol/L persulfate to the TOC reduction UV reactor improved the efficiency of urea removal from 9% to 90%. UV dose was an important factor of urea removal. In the ion analysis, nitrate and sulfate were detected in the effluent, and the ratio of produced nitrate to the removed urea was approximately 2. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study investigated the VUV/UV photodegradation of three iodinated disinfection byproducts (I-DBPs), namely, triiodomethane (TIM), diiodoacetamide (DIAcAm) and triiodoacetic acid (TIAA), based on a mini-fluidic VUV/UV photoreaction system (MVPS). The pseudo-first-order rate constants (k) of TIM, DIAcAm and TIAA under VUV/UV irradiation (1769, 1301 and 1174 m(2) einstein(-1), respectively) were higher than those under UV irradiation (1003, 832 and 766 m(2) einstein(-1), respectively). The enhancement of photodegradation could be attributed to the indirect HO center dot oxidation rather than the direct VUV photolysis. As a whole, compared with the indirect HO center dot oxidation, the direct UV photolysis had a relatively greater contribution to the degradation of the three I-DBPs, especially DIAcAm and TIAA (ca. 57% and 60%, respectively). The two electron-withdrawing groups in DIAcAm and TIM (i.e., acylamino and carboxyl) decreased the electron density of the C-I bonds, thus weakening the electrophilic attack of HO center dot. The iodine in the three I-DBPs was released to form I- and a small fraction (< 6%) of I- was oxidized to IO3-, indicating that HO center dot preferred to break the C-I bonds rather than oxidize I-. The direct UV photolysis proceeded via H2O-catalyzed deiodination reactions, while the indirect HO center dot oxidation proceeded via deiodination reactions along with HO center dot addition. The VUV/UV photodegradation of the three I-DBPs was more favored at an acidic pH but inhibited by the water matrix components (i.e., NOM, Cl- and alkalinity) to different extents.

AB Sewage sludge, the major by-product during the primary treatment and subsequent biotreatment of wastewater, is increasingly generated around the world. KMnO4-Fe(II) consists both oxidation properties of KMnO4 and flocculation ability by in-situ formed Fe(III) and is widely used in water treatment. In this study, KMnO4-Fe(II) was used as chemical conditioners to synchronously improve sludge dewatering performance and catalyze the biomass pyrolysis of waste activated sludge for preparing multi-functional material to remedy arsenic containing groundwater. The results showed that the sludge dewaterability was significantly improved due to the moderate pre-oxidation of extracellular polymeric substances by KMnO4, and then the sludge particles were re-flocculated by Fe(III) generated from KMnO4-Fe(II). The conditioned sludge cake was then utilized for preparing sludge-based carbon (Fe-Mn-SBC) which was systematically characterized. The surface area of Fe-Mn-SBC was characteristic of high surface area (100.08 m(2)/g) which had a great adsorption capacity on arsenic. Besides, Fe-Mn-SBC could effectively oxidize As(III) to As(V), and addition of low dose of H2O2 can further improve total arsenic removal due to catalytic peroxidation of Fe-Mn-SBC. Besides, it was found that the presence of humic acid could inhibit the hydroxy iron formation and compete for the active adsorption sites and then resulted in the decrease in arsenic removal, and the co-existing humic acid could also be removed by adsorption of Fe-Mn-SBC. This work proposed a novel sludge treatment process by combining enhanced sludge dewatering with catalytic pyrolysis for preparing multi-functional materials, and they are promising in treatment of water containing combined pollutants.

AB Sulfite has been widely employed as a key agent in many industrial processes, leading to a large amount of sulfite-laden wastes generated. Given its antimicrobial function and destructive ability on cell walls, detailed mechanisms for impacts of sulfite on waste activated sludge (WAS) and outcomes of methane production after the sulfite-pretreatment have not been clear so far. In this study, the feasibility of methane production from sulfite pretreated WAS was verified and investigated. Biochemical methane potential tests demonstrated that methane production from WAS after the pretreatment at 800 mg S/L of sulfite (a typical level in sulfite-laden wastes) increased by up to 25%. Kinetic analysis of the test results indicated that sulfite pretreatment increased the sludge hydrolysis rate (k(hyd)) by 1.71 times while the ultimate biochemical methane potential (B-u) by 1.20 times. Further study investigated the effects of sulfite on WAS from the macro-scale (i.e. sludge physicochemical properties) to the micro-scale (i.e. bacterial viability, microbial community). Sulfite concentrations of up to 800 mg S/L substantially enhanced WAS disintegration and solubilization, reducing the particle size by up to 39%, boosting substrate release by 87% and improving cell lysis by 43% through the direct destruction of gram-positive microorganisms (e.g., norank_p_Saccharibacteria) in WAS. Adverse impact on anaerobic digestion by introduction of sulfite was not observed in this study, though a long-term evaluation is needed in the future work. Based on the findings of the present study, sulfite-laden by-products or wastes from industrial processes may be co-treated with WAS when overall cost-effectiveness is concerned.

AB Local re-fusion of damaged sites on fused silica surface by using CO2 laser is an effective and commonly used method for mitigating their growth to resist subsequent UV laser irradiations. However, residual stress will be introduced in or around the mitigated sites during or after a rapid cooling process of a heated material, which is detrimental for the re-use of the fused silica element. Thus, controlling the temperature during the heating process is a critical issue. Unfortunately, the temperature and the corresponding stress evolution within irradiation time are still unclear at present. In this article, a thermo-mechanical model based on finite element was developed to investigate these issues, and experiments were performed to validate the simulated results. The surface morphology evolution of damaged sites during the re-fusion processes was elaborated. The residual stresses were quantified by using photoelastic technique and chemical etching methods, which were also compared with the simulated data. Results showed that the theoretical simulation data fits well with experimental results, which will provide a significant contribution on understanding the melting process and explaining the mitigation process of damaged sites irradiated by CO2 laser.

AB Tuning the enhanced optical and magnetic properties of rare earth doped glasses by embedding nanoparticles is a never-ending quest. Influences of heat treatment (annealing) in modifying the spectral features of melt-quench synthesized manganese oxide nanoparticles (Mn3O4 NPs) embedded Eu3+-doped borotellurite glasses are reported. The growth of NPs is tuned by varying the annealing time. TEM micrograph reveals the nucleation of heat treated Mn3O4 NPs and SAED manifest their growth along the (1 1 2) crystallographic planes having average size in the range of 5.2 to 21.4 nm. The SPR bands are evidenced in the range 350 to 700 nm that validates the growth of Mn3O4 NPs in the glass matrix. The luminescence spectra reveal four major emission peaks at 591, 614, 651 and 700 nm originating from F-7(1), F-7(2) F-7(3), and F-7(4) transitions levels, respectively. Intensity enhancement displayed by heat treated glass samples is attributed to the local field effect of Mn3O4 NPs while a quenching is due to the energy transfer from Eu3+ to Mn3O4 NPs. The intensity parameters related to the radiative transitions within 4f configuration of Eu3+ ions are determined and analyzed using Judd-Ofelt theory. The magnetization versus field (M-H) at 12 h of Mn3O4 NPs shows the highest saturation magnetization. The ESR spectrum exhibits resonance signals with effective isotropic g values at 1.9, 3.0 and 4.3 where g at 1.9 are attributed to Mn2+ centers in an octahedral asymmetry and g at 3.0 and 4.3 are attributed to the rhombic symmetry of the Mn2+ ions. Present glass compositions are established to be promising for the development of photonic devices.

AB A series of glass nanocomposite samples of the general composition formula xMoO(3)-(1-x) (0.5SeO(2)-0.5ZnO) for x = 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 have been prepared by solid-state reaction, i.e., slow cooling process. The structural characteristics have been explored by analyzing X-ray diffraction patterns, Fourier-transform infrared, and UV-Vis spectra. The superposition of different nanophases SeO2, SeO3, ZnO, MoO3, Zn (SeO3), Zn (SeO4), Zn (MoO4), Zn2Mo3O8 and ZnMo8O10 over the amorphous glassy matrices have been identified, and their crystallite sizes have been evaluated as well. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra reveal different types of bonding like Zn-O-Se type and stretching vibrations of MoO6 octahedral units. It is observed that with increasing MoO3 concentration, the estimated values of optical bandgap energy, Urbach energy, and average crystallite size reduce. The dependency of electrical conductivity on frequency and temperature have been analyzed using Almond-West formalism and Jonscher's universal power-law. The non-linear character of DC conductivity and different activation energies at low and high-temperature regions affirm that the present glassy systems exhibit semiconducting nature. Moreover, DC conduction process is due to small polaron hopping through localized or defect states. The decreasing trend of power-law exponent (s) with temperature rise reveals that AC conduction mechanism is consistent with the correlated barrier-hopping (CBH) model. The existing correlated barrier hopping model has been modified to attain reasonable values of fitting parameters and to obtain theoretical values of ideal thermodynamic glass transition temperature. The AC conductivity activation energy and free energy required for small polaron migration reduce with increasing conductivity. The scaling property emphasizes that conductivity relaxation process is subjected to the structure of the composition and does not depend on temperature.

AB The barrier properties of the technologically attractive amorphous silica films depend on their structural characteristics at the atomic level, which, in turn are strongly influenced by the deposition conditions. In this paper, we propose an investigation of the poorly investigated densification mechanism of amorphous SiO2 films processed by CVD from TEOS and O-2 between 400 and 550 degrees C. Based on literature survey and our original experimental results, we show that the densification process of these films, occurring with increasing the deposition temperature, is highlighted by a decrease of the water and silanol content, probed by transmission FTIR. We discuss the evolution of Si-O-Si related vibration signatures and we use the central force model to correlate the LO2 and LO3 shifts with the decrease of the Si-O-Si bond force constant, when the deposition temperature increases. Nuclear analysis reveals that films processed below 525 degrees C present hydrogen content between 5 +/- 0.3 and 7 +/- 0.3%at. Ellipsometry measurements attest that films processed at 550 degrees C are close to O/Si silica stoichiometry and hydrogen free. We show that application of the P-etch test results in particularly low erosion rate of 10 angstrom.s(-1) for dense films processed at 550 degrees C.

AB We report on design and fabrication of Ni2+-doped glass-ceramics from a low-alkali optical glass in Li2O-Na2O-Ga2O3-SiO2-GeO2 system by melting technique and subsequent thermally controlled nano-crystallization. The analysis of differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy reveals, for the first time, the real possibility of optimizing the integrated intensity of Ni2+ near-infrared emission through controlled pre-treatments at temperatures of nanophase nucleation, with the enhancement up to a factor of four with respect to gallium germanosilicate glass-ceramics obtained without pre-treatments. Importantly, the effects on the light emission are shown to be related to the influence of pre-treatment on size and size distribution of the gallium oxide nanocrystals which result from subsequent crystallization at higher temperature.

AB CaO-SiO2-Al2O3-MgO (CSAM) system is a fundamental and significant system in geology, metallurgy and the glass industry. Herein, we firstly investigated the roles of minor elements on the microstructures of this system. By Raman spectra and deconvolutions, we found that the presence of B2O3 induced an increase of the degree of polymerization (DOP) of the networks. On the contrary, the existence of Na2O, K2O and MnO had an opposite effect, i.e., the average number of bridging oxygen per Si atom decreased by 0.20, 0.07 and 0.11, respectively, with similar to 5 wt% of additions. Moreover, two particular minor elements, CaF2 and CaS, resulted in a decrease of the DOP. Furthermore, the macroproperties of this CSAM system with various minor elements were connected to the present microstructural analysis and thus the micro-macro relationship was deeply discussed, based on which we elucidated the clues for modifying this system in different levels using these minor elements.

AB Thin films of tellurite glasses are prepared using thermal evaporation method from the two bulk systems of glass 75TeO(2)-5 WO3-15Nb(2)O(5)-5NiO (TWNN5) and 78TeO(2)-5WO(3)-15Nb(2)O(5)-2NiO (TWNN2). The effect of annealing in temperature ranging from 200 to 400 degrees C on the optical and structural properties of the glassy systems in the form of thin films have been investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD), atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and UV-Vis-NIR Spectrometry techniques. The XRD pattern showed that at 400 degrees C, the annealed TWNN5 film were polycrystalline with four phases while the sample TWNN2 has only one crystalline phase (orthorhombic gamma-TeO2). The SEM and AFM images show the presence of different particle size of nanocrystals at 400 degrees C which confirmed via XRD pattern for annealed films. The EDX spectrum confirms the presence of Te, W, Nb, Ni and O elements in the prepared films. The transmittance, absorbance and reflectance of as-prepared and annealed thin films were measured spectrophotometry and from which optical, dielectric and dispersion energy parameters have been extracted. The direct energy band gap E-g of the film sample TWNN2 is increased from 2.92 to 3.92 eV with the annealing temperature. While E-g decreases from 2.92 to 2.21 eV with increasing NiO content from 2% to 5%. Tuning of structural and optical properties for TWNN thin films open the avenue towards to be a potential for optoelectronic applications.

AB Here, for the first time, europium was incorporated into the open-structure three-dimensional mesoporous siliceous material. Samples with different loadings of europium were synthesized through one-step hydrothermal treatment based on sol-gel technique. The prepared samples were characterized by different characterization techniques and the results showed the formation of isolated trivalent europium ions in silica matric at low loading samples. However, at high loading samples, nanoparticles of europium III oxide, with an average size of 5-10 nm size, were detected inside the pores of mesoporous silica matrix. The photoluminescence property of the prepared samples was investigated at two different excitation wavelengths of 393 nm and 466 nm. The maximum photoluminescence emission intensity peaks was observed at approximately 614 nm at the two-excitation wavelength. The intensity of emission peak for the 614 nm was also found to be enhanced with increasing the loading of europium ions, this signify that europium acts as a good luminescent activator for red phosphor.

AB A sodium borate glass containing both trivalent cerium oxide and tetravalent cerium oxide states nano particles of 2-5 nm in size was successfully prepared by doping the glass with varying amounts of cerium (IV) oxide with. X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurement was used to determine the coexistence of the multivalent state of cerium oxide in the borate glass. Significant changes in the trivalent and tetravalent cerium oxide concentrations were observed when the glass was melted using different melting parameters and different raw materials. Glass made with borax that contained of 0.05mols of CeO2 and melted at 1100 degrees C for 3 h had the highest concentration of trivalent cerium oxide. Transmission electron micrographs confirmed the release of trivalent Ce2O3 and tetravalent CeO2 nanoparticles from the glassy matrix. Fourier transform Infrared measurements suggest that the CeO2 in the glass acts as both a glass-former and glass modifier.

AB Glasses from the binary CdO-B2O3 system were prepared with extended invert compositions containing high CdO content (50-90 mol%) by melting followed by annealing technique. Combined optical and FTIR spectral measurements were carried out to find out the structural constitution of the studied invert glasses and their suitability in optical purposes. Optical spectral data reveal distinct UV absorption due to unavoidable trace iron impurities. FTIR spectra indicate the role of CdO to convert some BO3 to BO4 groups as many of alkali and alkaline earth oxides. The IR spectra reveal distinct vibrational peaks due to BO3 and BO4 units within their specific different wavenumbers. At high CdO, the IR spectra reveal the possible sharing of vibrational peaks due to Cd-O, Cd-O-B or CdO4 as evidenced by the reference IR for crystalline CdO. Thermal expansion and density measurements show some changes which can be related to suggested behavior of Cd2+ ions. With high percent, CdO is assumed to behave as modifier beside forming CdO4 groups. The change in the role of CdO is also assumed to explain the variations in both the density and thermal expansion data. Such observed changes in both the density and thermal expansion are quite different than the borate anomaly identified in the thermal expansion data of alkali borate glasses and are identified at high CdO content.

AB The effect of of V2O5 additions (up to 8 mol%) on the physical properties (e.g., density, glass transition temperature and refractive indices) and mechanical behaviors (e.g., hardness, fracture toughness, elastic modulus) of a soda-lime borosilicate glass with a composition of 60.2SiO(2)-16.0B(2)O(3)-12.6Na(2)O-3.8Al(2)O(3)-5.7CaO-1.7ZrO(2) (mol%) have been investigated systematically. It was found that introducing V2O5 decreases the glass transition temperature and hardness while increases the refractive index and crack initiation load. Composition-property relationships, especially on mechanical properties, were examined in order to provide insights for the development of new glass materials with outstanding mechanical properties. The results show that V2O5 can be a glass component for engineering and insuring high crack resistant glasses and glasses with long-term stability. Additionally, elastic properties as a function of temperature were studied using Brillouin light scattering and temperature-independent elastic moduli behaviors were observed.

AB Thermal stability and heat dissipation of color converter are the key roadblocks for high-power white light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and laser diodes (LDs). In this work, we fabricated an efficient and heat-conducting color converter based on phosphor-sapphire composite (PSC) for white LEDs/LDs, in which Y3Al5O12:Ce3+ or Y3Al5O12:Ce3+/CaAlSiN3:Eu2+ phosphor glass film was sintered on a sapphire substrate by using low-melting borosilicate glass. The Y3Al5O12:Ce3+ PSC-based white LEDs achieve a high luminous efficacy of 155 lm/W, and the Y3Al5O12:Ce3+/CaAlSiN3:Eu2+ PSC-based white LEDs exhibit a warm white light with a correlated color temperature of 3509 K and a color rendering index of 88.3. The chromaticity of PSC-based white LDs shifts from cool to warm white. Furthermore, the PSC achieves a high thermal conductivity of 20.8 W m(-1) K-1, which provides the effective heat transfer channels. The working temperature of PSC is reduced by 46 degrees C compared with that of phosphor-in-silicone.

AB This work was focused on the glass forming ability (GFA) of Zr48Cu36Al16-xAgx alloys (x = 0, 2, ... 16) examination using three different methods. Critical diameters were determined by both discrete (classic) and continuous (cone test) methods. Several commonly used GFA thermal indicators were investigated as well. Due to oxygen contamination strong influence on the GFA of Zr-based alloys, oxygen content was measured in each prepared alloy by inert gas fusion method. Additionally, the authors discussed the alloy composition influence on the critical diameters and their respective thermal indicators values. These values were compared and their correlation with critical diameters was evaluated in terms of R-2 correlation coefficient values. The best correlation was calculated for the theta indicator (R-2 = 0.979).

AB Sm3+ doped lithium zinc alumino borate glasses with composition 15ZnF(2)-12Li(2)CO(3)-10BaO-8Al(2)O(3) (55-x) B2O3-xSm(2)O(3) where x = 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7 and 1.1 mol% were prepared by conventional melt quenching technique Their optical, physical, structural, mechanical and luminescence properties are investigated. UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectra showed all possible transitions of samarium ion in this glass matrix. Band gap values for all the glass samples were above 3 eV confirming the insulating nature for the glass. Densities, assessed using the Archimedes rule, were observed to be increasing with increasing samarium concentration. Increase in molar volume with addition of samarium content indicated that the extension of glass network is on account of the increase of number of Non-Bridging Oxygens created by network modifier samarium ions. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) image showed a smooth surface for the synthezied glass. X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) technique was employed to verify the amorphous nature of the glasses. A Makishima and Mackenzie theoretical model gave acceptable approximation of elasticity constants viz. Young's modulus, shear modulus, bulk modulus and Poisson's ratio. The high Vickers hardness values evaluated with mechanical loads of 50, 100, 300, 500, 1000 g force, proved the stability of the glasses. Emission spectra showed a prominent transition (4)G(5/2) -> H-6(7/2) at 598 nm excited with H-6(5/2) -> P-4(3/2) transition at 401 nm. Luminescence quenching effect was observed beyond 0.3 mol% Sm2O3 addition. The chromaticity coordinates (x, y) clustered in the orange-red region, making these Sm3+ doped lithium zinc alumino borate glasses suitable candidate for applications in LEDs and solid-state lasers.

AB In this work, particular attention was paid to the structural characteristics of the amorphous phase in glass-ceramic glazes from the SiO2-Al2O3-CaO-MgO-Na2O-K2O-ZnO system. The study was carried out on model glasses whose chemical composition corresponds to the chemical composition of the vitreous phase of the glazes determined on the basis of electron probe micro-analyzer (EMPA). Structural investigations of the obtained model glasses were carried out using the mid-infrared (MIR) and solid-state magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS-NMR) spectroscopy. The solid-state MAS-NMR study carried out on Al-27 and Si-29 nuclei showed that all aluminum and silicon ions have tetrahedral coordination and thus form the glass network. The results of the Si-29 solid-state MAS-NMR measurements also showed that with the increase of ZnO content in the glass chemical composition, the number of Q(3) and Q(2) silicon-oxygen units increases at the expense of Q(4) (where n is the number of bridging oxygens), thus indicating an increase in the degree of depolymerization of the alumino-silico-oxygen network of studied of glasses. Analysis of the MIR spectra of the obtained glasses confirmed the conclusions from the solid-state MAS-NMR research, i.e. that Zn2+ ions cause depolymerization of the glass network of glazes. The weakening of the network of glasses resulted in lowering of the transformation and dilatometric softenings temperature. The tests carried out on model glasses allow drawing conclusions about the structure and properties of the vitreous phase of real glazes.

AB Classical molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations of glassy materials critically rely on the availability of accurate empirical forcefields. To this end, empirical forcefields must exhibit an optimal balance between accuracy and simplicity-wherein forcefields that are too simple (underfitted) may not offer accurate predictions, whereas those that are too complex (overfitted) may not provide a good transferability over various systems. However, the development of new forcefields that capture the essential features of glassy materials while retaining minimum complexity has largely remained intuition-based thus far. Here, we report a new forcefield parametrization method that is based on machine learning optimization. By taking the example of glassy silica, we show that this approach allows us to identify the optimal degree of forcefield complexity in a non-biased fashion. Our method could greatly accelerate the development of new accurate, yet transferable forcefields for the modeling of silicate glasses.

ID K+; DEPTH; KNO3
AB Commercial soda-lime silicate float glasses are chemically strengthened at 450 degrees C for 4 and 24 h in molten potassium nitrate containing small but controlled amount of NaNO3. The ion-exchange efficiency is determined from the measurement of surface compressive stress, potassium penetration and flexural strength. Chemical strengthening remains efficient also for NaNO3 additions up to 0.5 wt% (equivalent to similar to 1350 ppm Na) and the glass performance being identical to those obtained in pure KNO3, with no significative difference between "tin" and "air" side. For larger Na contamination residual stress and strength are reduced by an amount of about 25%.

AB The reaction behavior and dynamic fragmentation of ZrCuNiAl bulk metallic glass (BMG) subjected to high velocity impact was investigated. ZrCuNiAl BMG specimens were launched into a quasi-sealed chamber filled with air or argon (Ar) under various velocities. The results demonstrated that the ZrCuNiAl metallic glass generated debris after impact, the debris reacted with oxygen in the air atmosphere. The combustion of Zr and Cu and the combination reaction of aluminum and nickel released heat, which caused significant over-pressure inside the chamber. This reaction was related to the fragmentation and the critical fragment size for reaction was determined by scanning electron microscope (SEM) images; In Ar atmosphere, the cumulative mass of debris of ZrCuNiAl BMG was following a near power function distribution. A model was established by combining the dynamic fracture distribution with chemical reaction of ZrCuNiAl BMG, which can predict the quasi-pressure inside the chamber under a certain range of velocities with acceptable accuracy.

AB Two alkaline-borate glass systems of composition x Li2O center dot 0.2 Cr2O3 center dot (99.8-x) B2O3 (x = 20, 30 and 40 mol%) and y K2O center dot (20-y) Li2O center dot 0.2 Cr2O3 center dot 79.8 B2O3 (y = 5, 10, 15 and 20 mol%) were prepared by traditional melt-quenching technique. The tunability of their optical spectra, offered by different alkaline contents, allowed disentangling the absorption edge from the characteristic Cr6+ optical transitions. Specifically, the optical band gap is barely affected (3.55 +/- 0.15 eV), whilst Cr6+/Cr3+ optical transitions undergo subtle intensity variation with the alkaline content. With increasing the alkaline content, or type, the crystal field strength (10 Dq) is increased, Racah parameters are decreased, and the ligand environment facilitates the crossover from weak into strong ligand field regimes. Electron spin resonance spectroscopy confirmed the existence and quantified the percentage of both Cr6+ (through charge transfer into Cr5+ O-) and Cr3+ oxidation states. Finally, the number of non-bridging oxygen, obtained from Infrared spectroscopy, is increased noticeably for both type and percentage of alkaline, while BO4 structural units increase with Li content and are barely affected for K-doped system.

AB Due to the environmental and economic circumstances, the use of renewable-energy increases every year. The uncertainty, volatility, and difficulty of storing energy in the large scales are obstacles to the more penetration of renewable energies in the market. Energy storage systems can be used as a solution to store energy at a time when energy consumption is lower than the generated energy or at a time when more energy is generated compared to what is demanded. In this paper, a comparison study has been conducted on the three energy storage systems that proportionated for a typical wind power plant with the capacity of 109 MW. The energy storage systems which are investigated in the current study, include a compressed air energy storage, a liquid air energy storage, and a hydrogen energy storage. For this purpose, the power generated from the wind farm, for eight hours (at peak-off times) is considered as an input for the energy storage systems. To explore various factors such as the environmental impact, economic efficiency, sustainability and renewability, a new method based on emergy analysis is employed. The results showed that the transformity of electricity from hydrogen energy storage was much inferior to that of electricity from the compressed air energy storage and liquid air energy storage. This means that the above-mentioned system utilized the lowest emergy to produce a unit of electricity. Emergy yield ratio of hydrogen energy storage power was 1.98. In fact, it was lower than the emergy yield ratio of compressed air energy storage (2.62) and liquid air energy storage (2.92). This finding proved that liquid air energy storage was more efficient at utilizing local resources. Environmental load ratio of hydrogen energy storage (1.02) was much higher than those of compressed air energy storage (0.62) and liquid air energy storage (0.52). Liquid air energy storage had an emergy sustainability index of 5.6, which was preferable compared to two other cases. It also had better ecological performance and environmental sustainability.

AB A detailed steady-state equilibrium-based simulation model was developed in Aspen Plus to demonstrate the CO2-gasification process of cow manure-derived hydrochar. Simulation was performed at gasification temperature of 700-1000 degrees C and equivalence ratio of 0.1-0.6 for HTC treatment temperatures between 180 and 260 degrees C. Various simulation outputs including gas yield, syngas composition, lower heating value, CO/CO2 conversion efficiency, H-2/CO ratio, and cold gas efficiency were evaluated. Simulation results revealed that CO concentration was increased with gasification temperature while H-2 concentration was initially increased until 950 degrees C and decreased afterwards. H-2 concentration was also decreased with the increasing equivalence ratio. However, CO concentration increased initially but started to decrease after equivalence ratio of 0.3. Gasification temperature of 850 degrees C and equivalence ratio of 0.3 resulted in the maximum concentrations of both CO and H-2 and lower heating value. Replacing CO2 with air increased the lower heating value as the concentration of H-2 was increased compared to the concentration of CO.

AB Microwave carbonization induced by microwave absorber was investigated to convert rapeseed shell to bio-oils and bio-chars. The effects of microwave power, vacuum pressure and absorber (SiC) to biomass mass ratio on heating profile and bio-oil production were investigated. Response surface methodology based on BOX-BEHNKEN design was used to study the significance of process parameters on product yields. The conditions (600.00 W, 19.21 kPa and 0.51) for obtaining high-yield liquid products (42.74%) were more stringent; namely, lower process parameters (492.54 W, 16.44 kPa and 0.49) could acquire more organics (23.61%), in which microwave absorber played the most significant role. Furthermore, composite absorbers with different TiC to SiC mass ratios were introduced under the maximum organics production condition. With the increase of TiC to SiC ratio from 5% to 40%, the organic yield first increased and then decreased and the char production was just the opposite. The GC-MS and H-1/C-13 NMR analysis showed that the high-yield bio-oil retained more aliphatics from cellulose and hemicellulose and lowered the relative content of aromatics. The SEM and N-2 adsorption-desorption characterizations indicated that the char obtained using 20TS had an obvious porousness carbon-skeleton structure and the highest surface properties. Appropriate amount of TiC effectively regulated the temperature rise, which made rapeseed shell be preheated and carbonized modestly. Therefore, microwave-carbonization of rapeseed shell under vacuum environment by using 20TS as absorber is a promising and competitive approach for production of bio-oil with high yield, and by-product of bio-char also had higher availability value.

AB Climate change is one of the biggest challenges at the present time, and to tackle such issue, solar energy and efficient buildings, in general, can be used. The goal is to design and optimize photovoltaic based decentralized district heating system and later compare it-economically and technically-against three different optimized typologies of solar district heating system in Nordic conditions. The photovoltaic based decentralized system consists of one centralized low temperature tank charged by photovoltaic and air-water heat pumps and a borehole thermal energy storage, while the decentralized high temperature tank charged by an individual water water heat pump in each house. The centralized warm tank charges the borehole thermal energy storage. The other three systems are photovoltaic based centralized, roof-mounted solar thermal based centralized and roof mounted solar thermal based decentralized district heating systems. In solar thermal based systems, collectors are used to directly charge the short-term storage tanks instead of the photovoltaics/heat pump combination. The proposed system is simulated using TRNSYS software. Lastly, purchased electricity and life cycle costs of the system are minimized using multi-objective optimization and the genetic algorithm. The results indicated that the decentralized photovoltaic based system outdoes all the other systems in terms of techno-economic performance. The purchased electricity can be reduced by 22% while at the same time life cycle cost can be reduced up to 40%, compared to the worst optimized system (solar thermal based centralized system). Moreover, the decentralized photovoltaic based energy system has a payback period of 9-27 years, compared to the solar thermal based system and the conventional single building-heat pump system, i.e. around 17-58 years and 15 years, respectively. The highest renewable energy fraction for heating can be close to 99% for this system. The decentralization and electrical based district systems are better in terms of life cycle cost, payback period and in terms of technical performance, compared to traditional single house and solar thermal based district heating systems.

AB The thermal performances of proposed compression-absorption refrigeration assisted by a heat-driven turbine (CRHT) at low evaporating temperature were numerically investigated. According to the ideal isentropic process and the isentropic efficiency, the mathematical models of the micro tube and the compressors are built up. The CRHT system was modeled and simulated by considering the mass conservation, energy conservation, mechanical power conservation, and exergy generation equation of each component. For the case of basic design, the operating parameters, energy balance and the total thermal conductance of each component are calculated and analyzed. The effects of generation temperature, evaporating temperature of R134a, ammonia mass fraction of NH3/H2O, and compression ratios on thirteen key operating parameters were simulated and discussed. The COP of the CRHT system is compared with those of the two-stage absorption refrigeration system and the heat driven compression-absorption refrigeration system in literatures, which proves that the proposed CRHT system possesses the best thermal performance. The exergy losses of each component were calculated and compared. It is indicated that the heat transfer areas of components should be optimized appropriately.

AB Nowadays, technologies and methods for using solar energy are presented in a wide range of different systems by researchers. One of the solutions to improve the performance of solar systems, is the idea of making hybrid solar system, and extensive works have been done by many researchers. Photovoltaic (PV) panels are among the most popular systems to produce electricity from sunlight, while solar chimney is another method for utilizing the solar energy. In this paper, a new model of hybrid PV panels and solar chimneys has been designed, which uses the airflow created below the collector of solar chimney for cooling of the PV panels. The dissipated thermal energy of the PV panels is used for heating the air under the collector. In this modeling, two main factors as the location and width of the PV panels in the solar chimney were investigated. Modeling was performed for four different modes of combining the hybrid PV panels and solar chimney in three different widths of 70, 50, 30 cm for all four modes. The best result was obtained for the hybrid of PV panels and solar chimney for placing 50 cm wide PV s, instead of a transparent collector. In this case, the average PV panels temperature was 5 degrees C lower than the average PV panels temperature of the non-hybrid mode of solar chimney. This decrease in temperature would increase the efficiency of the PV panels by 1%. Furthermore, in this mode, the maximum flow velocity shows 0.2 m/s reduction in comparison to the transparent collector.

AB Coal gasification unit, one of the most important units of the coal to ethylene glycol (CtEG) process, determines the amount and composition of syngas and is crucial to the overall performance of the CtEG process. Thus, the effect of coal gasifiers on the thermodynamic and techno-economic performance of coal to ethylene glycol (CtEG) process is analyzed and compared in this study. A rigorous steady-state modeling and simulation of the CtEG process with three different gasifiers (GSP, Shell and Texaco) is firstly performed and validated with literature data. Then the CO2 emissions, thermodynamic and economic performance of three cases of CtEG process with GSP, Shell and Texaco are detailed analyzed and compared. Moreover, the sensitivity analysis of the effect of economic parameters on the production cost of the CtEG process with different gasifiers is investigated. Results show that the exergy efficiency of the Case GSP is the highest, 43.98%, followed by Case Shell, 41.61% and Case Texaco, 39.22%. The capital cost of Case Shell is the highest, 2904.38 $/t-EG, followed by Case GSP, 2642.08 $/t-EG, and Case Texaco 2418.75 $/t-EG. The total production cost of Case Texaco is highest, 717.25 $/t-EG, followed by Case Shell, 705.05 $/t-EG, and Case GSP, 666.09 $/t-EG. The internal rate of return of Case GSP, Shell and Texaco are 18.01%, 14.24% and 17.72%, respectively. The CO2 emissions of Case GSP is the largest, 3.27 t/t-EG, followed by Case Shell, 3.12 t/t-EG and Case Texaco 2.89 t/t-EG.

AB Non-thermal plasma (NTP) assisted direct conversion of biogas (CH4 and CO2) into valuable liquid chemicals rather than syngas is investigated. The conversion of CH4 and CO2 is 22.1% and 16.2%, respectively, when combining NTP and Pt/UZSM5 catalyst. Approximately 60% yield of liquid products (formaldehyde, methanol, ethanol, and acetone) with limited carbon deposition (5.1%) is achieved. Coke formation is significantly lower than that has been previously reported in the dry reforming of methane with carbon dioxide to liquid oxygenate chemicals. High ratio of weak acidic sites and Pt species over zeolite catalyst benefit the formation of liquid chemicals and coke reduction, which can be used for catalyst modification to enhance the liquid yield and control coke formation.

AB Uninterrupted access to electric power has become the basic need of today's world. Rural parts of many countries still do not have access to electricity or have electric power access to weak distribution grids with inadequate transmission and distribution system infrastructure. However, the countries where there is an abundance of solar radiation, a good potential of bio-degradable waste and average availability of wind source, access to electricity for those remote areas can be managed by distributed power generation. Considering the fact that the renewable energy sources (Solar, Wind etc.) are intermittent in nature, battery energy storage systems (BESS) and other reservoirs like biogas energy sources are the potential candidates to be integrated with the renewable sources to ensure continuous access to electricity and energy security. In this paper, a unique combination of Solar PV, Wind, Biomass and Vanadium Redox Flow Battery (VRFB) storage integrated hybrid Microgrid has been modeled and implemented practically for the first time. The capacity selection of different renewable sources for satisfying daily energy demand and their techno-commercial optimization has been performed through HOMER simulation. Further, the peak load shaving that is a limitation of HOMER model, has been established through PSCAD simulation by providing the real life data of different renewable sources, VRFB storage and the load profile as input to the model. The simulation model performances have been validated by a practical 10 kW(P) solar PV, 1 kW wind and 15 kVA Biogas generator integrated with 1 kW 6 h VRFB storage based Microgrid installed at India Institute of Engineering Science and Technology campus, India. In addition to these, zero loss of power supply probability (LPSP) has been ensured by implementing smart scheduling and controller considering the intermittency of the renewable sources. As a part of the financial analysis, project Investment on Return (IRR) and pay back has been calculated considering initial investment, operation and maintenance cost and revenue of generation.

AB A novel SOFC-HCCI engine hybrid power generation system fueled with alternative fuels is proposed and modeled in this paper. The steady-state modeling shows that it is feasible to use SOFC anode off-gas as the downstream HCCI engine fuel for additional power generation under certain fuel utilization and operating temperature. Through parametric and exergy analyses, it is found that the hybrid system without additional H-2 can achieve a net electrical efficiency of approximately 59% and an exergy efficiency of 57%, slightly higher than the SOFC-GT hybrid system. In this hybrid system, the components of HCCI engine and its exhaust gas dominate the exergy destruction, which contributes nearly 75% but has a relatively low contribution to the total power. Based on this, the methods of recycling exhaust gas waste heat to drive hydrogen desorption of metal hydride as H-2 addition for HCCI engine and H-2 recirculation for SOFC anode off-gas are suggested to significantly improve the system overall efficiency due to the consideration of thermal efficiency. The high overall efficiency up to 79.54% and fuel flexibility demonstrate that the novel hybrid system is a promising energy conversion system.

AB This paper mainly focuses on the optimization and design of cathode catalyst layer structure for low-Pt loading membrane assembly electrode. When Pt loading at cathode increased from 0.025 mg cm(-2) to 0.4 mg cm(-2), the apparent current density of electrode increases gradually, while the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) and the utilization rate of catalyst show a downward trend. As Pt loading at cathode keeps at 0.1 mg cm(-2), commercial Vulcan XC-72 carbon are doped into the conventional Pt/C catalyst layer to improve the utilization rate of the catalyst. The results show that the optimum doping carbon content leads to 2 times increase of the thickness of the cathode catalyst layer, and achieves a 32.93% increase of ECSA and better durability than that of conventional catalyst layer. Meanwhile, gas transport in the catalyst layer becomes more difficult with the increase of the amount of doping carbon. Based on this, a more stable Vulcan XC-72@PTFE particles are prepared and selected to construct internal gas transport channels under the same carbon content. The surface contact angle of the catalyst layer is obviously increased to 118.4 degrees. The hydrophobicity of the cathode catalyst layer is enhanced, and the oxygen gain voltage is significantly reduced. The peak power density of PEMFC reaches 539 mW cm(-2), which is 30.57% higher than that of one with a conventional catalyst layer structure. Therefore, this work provides a good way for the preparation of high-performance and durable cathode catalyst layer for low-Pt loading membrane assembly electrode.

AB The quest for a single universally applicable probability distribution for wind speed is reviewed and shown to be largely futile due to the "mixed" nature of wind climates. The physical justification, derivation and development of the OEN mixture model for the joint distribution of wind speed and direction is described. An automatic, unsupervised method for fitting wind observations is proposed, implemented as R scripts and applied to wind records from 128 WMO reporting stations, distributed globally and in every Koppen climate class to give global coverage. The effect of the standard 1 kn speed and 10 degrees direction reporting intervals on the rms error and the coefficient of determination, R-2, is assessed by bootstrapping and is used to set the target goodness-of-fit criteria. The OEN mixture model is shown to meet the target criteria at all 128 stations, demonstrating its global potential as a physically realistic model for joint and marginal wind speed and direction distributions. R scripts to reproduce the results and apply the method to other sites are freely available for download and use from the Mendeley archive.

AB This paper presents the development and experimental evaluation of a multivariable feedback controller for small-capacity ammonia-water absorption systems. Experiments were designed to identify the pairings between various controlled variables and the degrees of freedom available in the system. A small-scale experimental system was fabricated with access to all degrees of freedom in the system as tunable parameters. Transient analysis of variations in the degrees of freedom assisted in tuning the parameters of the control system to achieve fast, stable and repeatable performance. A methodology for controlling the cooling capacity of the system in response to changes in the load or operating conditions by adjusting the concentrated solution flow rate and the heat source temperature and mass flow rate is developed. In addition, the performances of the evaporator and the desorber are optimized by using flow control valves. Case studies using the developed controller demonstrated fast and stable performance of the system in achieving part-load performance as low as 50% of the baseline cooling capacity, and at off-design ambient temperature. Moreover, the system maintained high, near design COP (0.55-0.65) values during these test cases.

AB Thermoelectric devices are currently being used in the applications of cooling and generating electricity. This study mainly focuses on using these devices for both applications toward cooling down computer chips. An important aspect in designing the cooling system is to minimize the non-uniformity of the temperature distribution in the computer chip so as to reduce the thermal stresses in it. Another aspect in designing the cooling system is to minimize its power requirements. To investigate these two aspects, the temperatures of the cold chip areas can be allowed to increase, but not to exceed a certain temperature threshold, by installing Thermoelectric Generators (TEGs) on these areas that can harvest electrical power from the chip wasted heat. Thereafter, the chip hotspot areas can be cooled down by installing Thermoelectric Coolers (TECs) on these areas that can be powered by the harvested electrical power from the TEGs in order to maintain the temperatures of these hotspots to be less than or equal a certain temperature threshold. This cooling technique is called "sustainable self-cooling framework" for cooling chip hotspots. However, the question is: can the harvested electrical power by the TEGs be enough to power the TECs for cooling chip hotspots? In this study, a 3D model is developed to optimize the performance of both TEGs and TECs. Thereafter, this model is validated against experimental data of TEC and TEG. The results showed that the model predictions were in good agreements with the experimental data to within +/- 4%. Also, considerations are given in this study to optimize the performance of cascaded and non cascaded TEGs and TECs for future use them to develop sustainable self-cooling frameworks for cooling chip hotspots at different operating conditions. Finally, a case study is conducted in this paper for a sustainable self cooling framework in order to address the question above. The results showed that the self-cooling framework can successfully cool down the hotspot at an acceptable temperature with not only no need for additional electrical power requirements but also for reducing the non-uniformity in the chip temperature distribution.

AB Oxy-fuel combustion is the most promising carbon capture and storage technology, which eliminates carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere and also decreases nitrogen oxides emissions thereby lowering global warming potential. In order to implement oxy-fuel combustion technology in full scale power plants, its costs, mainly connected with the amount of pure oxygen produced, must be lowered. The main hypothesis is that it is possible to maintain similar velocity and heat transfer distribution while maintaining stable and efficient burner operation during both combustion technologies modifying burner aerodynamics. Excess oxygen is chosen as a representative parameter of burner's performance and investigation is carried out for four different oxy-fuel burner oxygen excess ratios (lambda: 0.8, 0.98, 1.07, and 1.24) together with reference air combustion case. This study suggests a workflow, based on semi-industrial experimental investigations and computational fluid dynamics model composed of advanced sub-models for different combustion phases for development of real scale dual mode coal swirl burners able for efficient operation during both combustion regimes. The results show that the temperature in near-burner zone and nitrogen oxides emissions increase, while carbon monoxide emissions decrease with the increase of burner oxygen excess ratio, and stable combustion with similar velocity and temperature distributions for both combustion modes is achieved for oxygen excess ratio of 1.07, with decrease in nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide emissions during oxy-fuel combustion. The performed study demonstrates that it is possible to choose the appropriate burner settings regarding nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide emissions and burner's ability to operate stably in both air and oxy-fuel combustion modes.

AB Geothermal heat pump has been widely recognized as one of the promising technologies for building applications because of its high energy efficiency and low operating expense, however the high capital investment and installation costs discourage building owners to choose such a system. The horizontal geothermal heat pump system with reduced cost is a viable option that would be utilized widely, the aim of this paper is to catalogue and critique a range of effective approaches for the horizontal geothermal heat pump systems in different regions based on techno-economic assessment data. A ground heat exchanger is a vital component of the horizontal geothermal heat pump. The state-of-the-art analytical and numerical models of the linear-loop, slinky-coil and spiral-coil ground heat exchangers are generalized, in addition to their advantages and disadvantages. A large number of economic evaluation methods for analysing the financial performance of the horizontal geothermal heat pump system are presented. At the end, the standpoints, recommendations and potential future study on the horizontal geothermal heat pump system are deliberated.

AB Solar photovoltaic plants are today a competitive alternative to power plants based on fossil fuels. Cost reduction in photovoltaics modules, scalability and ease of installation of these plants are enabling a rapid worldwide expansion of the technology. Nevertheless, dispatchability still remains as the major challenge to overcome due the intrinsic variability of solar energy. Most of the current solar photovoltaic facilities at large scale lack energy storage while those with storage systems rely on expensive batteries. Batteries are based on elements such as nickel, lithium or cadmium whose scarcity hinder their sustainability for storing energy in the large scale. This manuscript presents a novel concept to integrate thermochemical energy storage in photovoltaic plants. Furthermore, the concept is also directly adaptable to wind power plants to store surplus energy. The paper analyses the suitability of the Calcium-Looping process as thermochemical energy storage system in solar photovoltaics plants. The system works as follows: part of the power produced in the solar plant provides electricity to the grid while the rest is used to supply heat for calcination of calcium carbonate. After calcination, the products of the reaction - calcium oxide and carbon dioxide- are stored separately. When power production is required, the stored products are brought together in a carbonation reactor wherein the exothermic reaction releases energy for power production. The overall system is simulated to estimate the process behaviour and results show that storage efficiencies of similar to 40% can be achieved. Moreover, an economic analysis is developed to compare the proposed system with batteries. Due to the low price of natural calcium oxide precursors, such as limestone, and the expected longer lifetime of equipment as compared to batteries, the Calcium-Looping process can be considered as a potential alternative for improving dispatchability in solar photovoltaic plants.

AB In spite of valuable studies done so far on the field polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells, one substantial question has not been answered yet; optimization considering which combination of performance criteria brings the greatest benefits. Here, to address and uncover the issue, an approach is proposed and implemented for a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell as the case study. Different optimization scenarios, in each of which one possible combination of efficiency, power density, levelized cost, and size is considered as the objective functions, are defined and having obtained and compared optimized answers of different scenarios, the best of them is selected based on the four mentioned preference criteria for transportation and stationary applications. In addition, impacts of variation of capacity on the results of decision making and corresponding values of the four performance criteria are investigated. The results show that optimizations considering power density and levelized cost are equivalent. Moreover, despite what may seem at first, multi-objective optimization considering all performance criteria as the objective functions is not the best solution, and for both applications and all studied capacities range from 10 to 100 kW, multi-objective optimization based on either power density or levelized cost and size is taken into account as the best optimization strategy.

AB We present a numerical scheme for approximating the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations based on an auxiliary variable associated with the total system energy. By introducing a dynamic equation for the auxiliary variable and reformulating the Navier-Stokes equations into an equivalent system, the scheme satisfies a discrete energy stability property in terms of a modified energy and it allows for an efficient solution algorithm and implementation. Within each time step, the algorithm involves the computations of two pressure fields and two velocity fields by solving several de-coupled individual linear algebraic systems with constant coefficient matrices, together with the solution of a nonlinear algebraic equation about a scalar number involving a negligible cost. A number of numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and the performance of the presented algorithm. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A method is presented for constructing energy-conserving Galerkin approximations in the vertical coordinate of the full quasigeostrophic model with active surface buoyancy. The derivation generalizes the approach of Rocha et al.(2016) [1] to allow for general bases. Details are then presented for a specific set of bases: Legendre polynomials for potential vorticity and a recombined Legendre basis from Shen (1994) [2] for the streamfunction. The method is tested in the context of linear baroclinic instability calculations, where it is compared to the standard second-order finite-difference method and to a Chebyshev collocation method. The Galerkin scheme is quite accurate even for a small number of degrees of freedom N, and growth rates converge much more quickly with increasing N for the Galerkin scheme than for the finite-difference scheme. The Galerkin scheme is at least as accurate as finite differences and can in some cases achieve the same accuracy as the finite difference scheme with ten times fewer degrees of freedom. The energy-conserving Galerkin scheme is of comparable accuracy to the Chebyshev collocation scheme in most linear stability calculations, but not in the Eady problem where the Chebyshev scheme is significantly more accurate. Finally the three methods are compared in the context of a simplified version of the nonlinear equations: the two-surface model with zero potential vorticity. The Chebyshev scheme is the most accurate, followed by the Galerkin scheme and then the finite difference scheme. All three methods conserve energy with similar accuracy, despite not having any a priori guarantee of energy conservation for the Chebyshev scheme. Further nonlinear tests with non-zero potential vorticity to assess the merits of the methods will be performed in a future work. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we consider numerical approximations for a dendritic solidification phase field model with melt convection in the liquid phase, which is a highly nonlinear system that couples the anisotropic Allen-Cahn type equation, the heat equation, and the weighted Navier-Stokes equations together. We first reformulate the model into a form which is suitable for numerical approximations and establish the energy dissipative law. Then, we develop a linear, decoupled, and unconditionally energy stable numerical scheme by combining the modified projection scheme for the Navier-Stokes equations, the Invariant Energy Quadratization approach for the nonlinear anisotropic potential, and some subtle explicit-implicit treatments for nonlinear coupling terms. Stability analysis and various numerical simulations are presented. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Kinetic equations play a major rule in modeling large systems of interacting particles. Uncertainties may be due to various reasons, like lack of knowledge on the microscopic interaction details or incomplete informations at the boundaries. These uncertainties, however, contribute to the curse of dimensionality and the development of efficient numerical methods is a challenge. In this paper we consider the construction of novel multi-scale methods for such problems which, thanks to a control variate approach, are capable to reduce the variance of standard Monte Carlo techniques.

AB Computational costs of numerically solving multidimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) increase significantly when the spatial dimensions of the PDEs are high, due to large number of spatial grid points. For multidimensional reaction-diffusion equations, stiffness of the system provides additional challenges for achieving efficient numerical simulations. In this paper, we propose a class of Krylov implicit integration factor (IIF) discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods on sparse grids to solve reaction-diffusion equations on high spatial dimensions. The key ingredient of spatial DG discretization is the multiwavelet bases on nested sparse grids, which can significantly reduce the numbers of degrees of freedom. To deal with the stiffness of the DG spatial operator in discretizing reaction-diffusion equations, we apply the efficient IIF time discretization methods, which are a class of exponential integrators. Krylov subspace approximations are used to evaluate the large size matrix exponentials resulting from IIF schemes for solving PDEs on high spatial dimensions. Stability and error analysis for the semi-discrete scheme are performed. Numerical examples of both scalar equations and systems in two and three spatial dimensions are provided to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the methods. The stiffness of the reaction-diffusion equations is resolved well and large time step size computations are obtained. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper concerns the fast evaluation of the matvec g = Kf for K is an element of C-NxN, which is the discretization of an oscillatory integral transform g(x) = integral K(x, xi) f(xi)d xi with a kernel function K(x, xi) = alpha(x, xi)e(2 pi i Phi(x, xi)), where alpha(x, xi) is a smooth amplitude function, and Phi(x, xi) is a piecewise smooth phase function with O(1) discontinuous points in x and xi. A unified framework is proposed to compute Kf with O (N log N) time and memory complexity via the non-uniform fast Fourier transform (NUFFT) or the butterfly factorization (BF), together with an O (N) fast algorithm to determine whether NUFFT or BF is more suitable. This framework works for two cases: 1) explicit formulas for the amplitude and phase functions are known; 2) only indirect access of the amplitude and phase functions are available. Especially in the case of indirect access, our main contributions are: 1) an O (N log N) algorithm for recovering the amplitude and phase functions is proposed based on a new low-rank matrix recovery algorithm; 2) a new stable and nearly optimal BF with amplitude and phase functions in a form of a low-rank factorization (IBF-MAT(1)) is proposed to evaluate the matvec Kf. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB By introducing a scalar auxiliary variable (SAV), we propose a class of semi-implicit time-stepping, unconditionally energy stable numerical schemes for simulating wrinkling phenomena of an elastic thin films on a compliant substrate. These SAV schemes only need to solve, twice, a decoupled linear, fourth-order integro-differential equations with constant coefficients at each time step, and these linear equations can be efficiently implemented by using Fourier spectral method to discretize spatial derivatives. Numerical results have demonstrated that these SAV schemes (including first-order SAV/BDF1, second-order SAV/BDF2 and SAV/CN2) are highly efficient and accurate. Furthermore, many interesting wrinkling phenomena, such as pattern formations (e.g., stripes, checkerboards, labyrinths, herringbones) and pattern transitions under different loading processes, are investigated by using the proposed schemes.

AB We introduce in this paper an operator-adapted multiresolution analysis for finite-element differential forms. From a given continuous, linear, bijective, and self-adjoint positive-definite operator L, a hierarchy of basis functions and associated wavelets for discrete differential forms is constructed in a fine-to-coarse fashion and in quasilinear time. The resulting wavelets are L-orthogonal across all scales, and can be used to derive a Galerkin discretization of the operator such that its stiffness matrix becomes block-diagonal, with uniformly well-conditioned and sparse blocks. Because our approach applies to arbitrary differential p-forms, we can derive both scalar-valued and vector-valued wavelets block-diagonalizing a prescribed operator. We also discuss the generality of the construction by pointing out that it applies to various types of computational grids, offers arbitrary smoothness orders of basis functions and wavelets, and can accommodate linear differential constraints such as divergence-freeness. Finally, we demonstrate the benefits of the corresponding operator-adapted multiresolution decomposition for coarse-graining and model reduction of linear and non-linear partial differential equations.

AB This paper proposes a numerical algorithm to model multi-component real gas flows in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). The approach is based on the solution of the Euler equations for the mixtures which is coupled with the mass conservation equation for each component of fluid. This algorithm is based on the extension of Roe's scheme for real gases introduced in [21], which is robust, efficient and simpler than the other extensions. The Euler equations for the mixture are solved whereas fluid components are updated using a classical upwind approximation. As the solution evolves, the developed method preserves the positivity of the mass fractions of all components. The proposed technique does not directly involve the thermodynamics derivatives at the average state, which avoids assumptions and approximations in the calculation of these derivatives. The pressure oscillation problem appearing in the case of flow fields including material contact has been also discussed. The numerical experiments show the accuracy and robustness of the method in various cases. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Given the increasing number of proposals and definitions of operators in the scope of fractional calculus, it is important to introduce a systematic classification. Nonetheless, many of the definitions that emerged in the literature can not be considered as fractional derivatives. We analyze a list of expressions to have a general overview of the concept of fractional (integrals) derivatives. Moreover, some formulae that do not involve the term fractional, are also included due to their particular interest in the area. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, Runge-Kutta-Gegenbauer (RKG) stability polynomials of arbitrarily high order of accuracy are introduced in closed form. The stability domain of RKG polynomials extends in thereal direction with the square of polynomial degree, and in the imaginary direction as an increasing function of Gegenbauer parameter. Consequently, the polynomials are naturally suited to the construction of high order stabilized Runge-Kutta (SRK) explicit methods for systems of PDEs of mixed hyperbolic-parabolic type.
   We present SRK methods composed of Lordered forward Euler stages, with complexvalued stepsizes derived from the roots of RKG stability polynomials of degree L. Internal stability is maintained at large stage number through an ordering algorithm which limits internal amplification factors to 10L(2). Test results for mildly stiff nonlinear advectiondiffusion- reaction problems with moderate (less than or similar to 1) mesh Peclet numbers are provided at second, fourth, and sixth orders, with nonlinear reaction terms treated by complex splitting techniques above second order.

AB We propose an automatic algorithm for 3D inverse electromagnetic scattering based on the combination of topological derivatives and regularized Gauss-Newton iterations. The algorithm is adapted to decoding digital holograms. A hologram is a two-dimensional light interference pattern that encodes information about three-dimensional shapes and their optical properties. The formation of the hologram is modeled using Maxwell theory for light scattering by particles. We then seek shapes optimizing error functionals which measure the deviation from the recorded holograms. Their topological derivatives provide initial guesses of the objects. Next, we correct these predictions by regularized GaussNewton techniques devised to solve the inverse holography problem. In contrast to standard Gauss-Newton methods, in our implementation the number of objects can be automatically updated during the iterative procedure by new topological derivative computations. We show that the combined use of topological derivative based optimization and iteratively regularized Gauss-Newton methods produces fast and accurate descriptions of the geometry of objects formed by multiple components with nanoscale resolution, even for a small number of detectors and non convex components aligned in the incidence direction.

AB A novel adaptive mesh refinement method is proposed. The novelty of the method lies in using a dual data structure with two trees: A classical one for the computational cells and an extra one dedicated to computational cell faces. This new dual structure simplifies the algorithm, making the method easy to implement. It results in an efficient adaptive mesh refinement method that preserves an acceptable memory cost. This adaptive mesh refinement method is then applied to compressible multiphase flows in the framework of diffuse-interface methods. Efficiency of the method is demonstrated thanks to computational results for different applications: Transport, shock tube, surface-tension flow, cavitation and water-droplet atomization, in one and multi-dimensions. The test cases are performed with the open-source code ECOGEN and with quantitative comparisons regarding non-adaptive mesh refinement methods to analyze benefits. A discussion specific to parallel computing is also presented. (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

As a model for the nonlinear ultrasound propagation in thermoviscous fluids, we employ Westervelt's wave equation solved for the acoustic velocity potential. The angle of incidence of the wave is computed based on the information provided by the wave-field gradient which is readily available in the finite element framework. The absorbing boundary conditions are then updated with the angle values in real time. Numerical experiments illustrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method. (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

DT Article
DE Uncertainty quantification; Monte Carlo; Multifidelity; Global
   sensitivity analysis; Model reduction; Cardiac electrophysiology
AB Multifidelity Monte Carlo methods rely on a hierarchy of possibly less accurate but statistically correlated simplified or reduced models, in order to accelerate the estimation of statistics of high-fidelity models without compromising the accuracy of the estimates. This approach has recently gained widespread attention in uncertainty quantification [1]. This is partly due to the availability of optimal strategies for the estimation of the expectation of scalar quantities-of-interest [2]. In practice, the optimal strategy for the expectation is also used for the estimation of variance and sensitivity indices [3]. However, a general strategy is still lacking for vector-valued problems, nonlinearly statistically-dependent models, and estimators for which a closed-form expression of the error is unavailable. The focus of the present work is to generalize the standard multifidelity estimators to the above cases. The proposed generalized estimators lead to an optimization problem that can be solved analytically and whose coefficients can be estimated numerically with few runs of the high-and low-fidelity models. We analyze the performance of the proposed approach on a selected number of experiments, with a particular focus on cardiac electrophysiology, where a hierarchy of physics-based lowfidelity models is readily available.

AB We develop a finite volume method based on Crank-Nicolson time discretization for the two-dimensional nonsymmetric Riemann-Liouville space-fractional diffusion equation. Stability and convergence are then carefully discussed. We prove that the finite volume scheme is unconditionally stable and convergent with second-order accuracy in time and min{1 + alpha, 1 + beta} order in space with respect to a weighted discrete norm. Here 0 < alpha, beta < 1 are the space-fractional order indexes in xand ydirections, respectively. Furthermore, we rewrite the finite volume scheme into a matrix form and develop a matrix-free preconditioned fast Krylov subspace iterative method, which only requires storage of O(N) and computational cost of O(NlogN) per iteration without losing any accuracy compared to the direct Gaussian elimination method. Here Nis the total number of spatial unknowns. Consequently, the fast finite volume method is particularly suitable for large-scale modeling and simulation. Numerical experiments verify the theoretical results and show strong potential of the fast method. (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents an efficient parallel method for the deterministic solution of the 3D stationary Boltzmann transport equation applied to diffusive problems such as nuclear core criticality computations. Based on standard MultiGroup-Sn-DD discretization schemes, our approach combines a highly efficient nested parallelization strategy[1] with the PDSA parallel acceleration technique[2] applied for the first time to 3D transport problems. These two key ingredients enable us to solve extremely large neutronic problems involving up to 10(12) degrees of freedom in less than an hour using 64 super-computer nodes. (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB The accurate analysis of patient lung structure and morphology in a clinical setting is one of the significant challenges in pulmonary medicine. In recent years, computational modelling techniques have been shown to help improve understanding of function-form relationships within the lungs, and of the underlying sensitivities of pulmonary function test responses to pulmonary disease. A large array of literature has been dedicated to modelling airflow and gas transfer within the lungs, and within vasculature. However, little work exists connecting the two systems together, particularly in computationally tractable ways. Within this study we outline a numerical scheme for modelling gas transport throughout the airways, pulmonary arterial network, and across the alveolar-capillary membrane. Through careful scheme design, and the application of high-performance computing structures, we show how these models can remain tractable, even when simulating to quite fine resolution. Following model development and error analysis, we apply the model to the simulation of the multiple-breath washout, a common pulmonary function test, illustrating how the choice of tracer gas may affect clinical diagnosis measures.

AB In this paper, we propose a Multiscale Virtual Element Method (MsVEM) for elliptic problems in heterogeneous porous media. The use of very general coarse grids has advantages in subsurface simulations since they provide flexibility and can render more accurate coarse model. It is often necessary to use an irregular coarse grid when highly heterogeneous reservoirs are discretized via irregular anisotropic fine grids. The proposed MsVEM aims to build a coarse model on a flexible grid by integrating Generalized Multiscale Finite Element Method (GMsFEM) with Virtual Element Method (VEM). Because of the irregularity merit of VEM, MsVEM is desirable to simulate complex real-world problems. In the framework of MsVEM, both coarse grid and fine grid may consist of more general polygons. To build multiscale basis functions on coarse grid, a few local problems are solved on each coarse block to enrich multiscale information and get a snapshot space. To significantly reduce degree of freedoms of the coarse multiscale model, we construct a low dimensional multiscale basis space by using greedy selection procedure and penalized matrix decomposition. The greedy selection procedure is utilized to select optimal multiscale basis functions. The penalized matrix decomposition is employed to improve approximation accuracy and get the sparse basis functions. To show the efficiency and accuracy, we present a few numerical examples for flows in heterogeneous porous media. In particular, MsVEM is applied to the subsurface flow in high-contrast porous media and fractured media. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We propose an efficient, robust, Lagrangian (characteristic-based) transport solver for 1-D time-dependent thermal radiative transfer (TRT) applications within the context of a moment-accelerated (High-Order/Low-Order, HOLO) algorithm. This novel transport algorithm inherits the best features of both particle methods (e.g., time accuracy, phase-space adaptivity, positivity) and deterministic, grid-based methods (e.g., no stochastic noise). Particles are evolved by the method of characteristics, with a time-dependent weight that accounts for stiff absorption and reemission process self-consistently. As a result, this approach is able to obtain accurate results while employing large time steps and a moderate number of particles (compared to Implicit Monte Carlo). (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The method is benchmarked in situations with like-particles, D(d,n)(3) He, unlike-particles, D(t,n)(4) He, thermonuclear plasmas, beam-target fusion, and for large difference in macroparticle weights. Studies of the required number of macroparticles in thermonuclear plasmas show that 100-1000 macroparticles are required to achieve repeatability of yields around 10%, likewise 10(4)-10(5) for 1%, depending on the fusion interaction and ion temperature.

DE Adjoint equations; Acoustics; Wave propagation
AB Adjoint methods enable the accurate calculation of the sensitivities of a quantity of interest. The sensitivity is obtained by solving the adjoint system, which can be derived by continuous or discrete adjoint strategies. In acoustic wave propagation, continuous and discrete adjoint methods have been developed to compute the eigenvalue sensitivity to design parameters and passive devices (Aguilar et al., 2017, [1]). In this short communication, it is shown that the continuous and discrete adjoint characteristic decompositions, and Riemann invariants, are connected by a similarity transformation. The results are shown in the Laplace domain. The adjoint characteristic decomposition is applied to a one-dimensional acoustic resonator, which contains a monopole source of sound. The proposed framework provides the foundation to tackle larger acoustic networks with a discrete adjoint approach, opening up new possibilities for adjoint-based design of problems that can be solved by the method of characteristics.

AB We present a numerical scheme for a previously unexploited formulation of the equations for unsteady viscoelastic flow. The formulation aligns the polymer stress along particle paths/streamlines, utilising the characteristic curves associated with the hyperbolic part of the constitutive equations. We illustrate the approach for the Oldroyd-B model in the benchmark 4:1 contraction for moderate elasticity numbers. We show that the scheme is able to accurately capture the re-entrant corner singularity for the polymer stresses and the pressure, the latter variable being inaccurately determined by schemes using the traditional formulation in terms of Cartesian polymer stresses. A space-step restriction for stability is derived, which can be numerically limiting in certain recirculation regions. This contrasts with the equivalent space-step restriction for the formulation in Cartesian stresses, which is limiting in flow regions of high velocity gradients, for example, at sharp corners in contraction flows.

AB We present new methods to solve the Riemann problem both exactly and approximately for general equations of state (EoS) to facilitate realistic modeling and understanding of astrophysical flows. The existence and uniqueness of the new exact general EoS Riemann solution can be guaranteed if the EoS is monotone regardless of the physical validity of the EoS. We confirm that: (1) the solution of the new exact general EoS Riemann solver and the solution of the original exact Riemann solver match when calculating perfect gas Euler equations; (2) the solution of the new Harten-Lax-van Leer-Contact (HLLC) general EoS Riemann solver and the solution of the original HLLC Riemann solver match when working with perfect gas EoS; and (3) the solution of the new HLLC general EoS Riemann solver approaches the new exact solution. We solve the EoS with two methods, one is to interpolate 2D EoS tables by the bi-linear interpolation method, and the other is to analytically calculate thermodynamic variables at run-time. The interpolation method is more general as it can work with other monotone and realistic EoS while the analytic EoS solver introduced here works with a relatively idealized EoS. Numerical results confirm that the accuracy of the two EoS solvers is similar. We study the efficiency of these two methods with the HLLC general EoS Riemann solver and find that analytic EoS solver is faster in the test problems. However, we point out that a combination of the two EoS solvers may become favorable in some specific problems. Throughout this research, we assume local thermal equilibrium. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB In a recent paper, the authors proposed a general methodology for probabilistic learning on manifolds. The method was used to generate numerical samples that are statistically consistent with an existing dataset construed as a realization from a non-Gaussian random vector. The manifold structure is learned using diffusion manifolds and the statistical sample generation is accomplished using a projected Ito stochastic differential equation. This probabilistic learning approach has been extended to polynomial chaos representation of databases on manifolds and to probabilistic nonconvex constrained optimization with a fixed budget of function evaluations. The methodology introduces an isotropic-diffusion kernel with hyperparameter epsilon. Currently, epsilon is more or less arbitrarily chosen. In this paper, we propose a selection criterion for identifying an optimal value of epsilon, based on a maximum entropy argument. The result is a comprehensive, closed, probabilistic model for characterizing data sets with hidden constraints. This entropy argument ensures that out of all possible models, this is the one that is the most uncertain beyond any specified constraints, which is selected. Applications are presented for several databases. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper focuses on the use of a mesh-less numerical method to solve barotropic fluid flows: Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH). Such methods suffer from a severe lack of accuracy when evaluating state variables as the pressure field. SPH-ALE methods based on Riemann solvers significantly improve this evaluation but increase the scheme complexity and low-Mach issues are difficult to prevent. We propose an alternative scheme called gamma - SPH - ALE relying on the combination of the SPH-ALE formalism and a finite volume stabilizing low-Mach scheme. Applied to Monophasic Barotropic Euler Equations, its characteristics are detailed and evaluated through a nonlinear stability analysis highlighting CFL-like conditions on the scheme parameters. As far as we know, it is the first time such nonlinear analysis is performed on a SPH-ALE scheme. Finally, its implementation on several academic test cases reveals that the proposed scheme actually increases both stability and accuracy, in reduced computation time, with respect to SPH ALE Riemann Solvers.

ID PAIR-COPULA CONSTRUCTIONS; UNCERTAINTY; CONVERGENCE; SELECTION; MODEL
AB We present a regression technique for data-driven problems based on polynomial chaos expansion (PCE). PCE is a popular technique in the field of uncertainty quantification (UQ), where it is typically used to replace a runnable but expensive computational model subject to random inputs with an inexpensive-to-evaluate polynomial function. The metamodel obtained enables a reliable estimation of the statistics of the output, provided that a suitable probabilistic model of the input is available.
   Machine learning (ML) regression is a research field that focuses on providing purely data-driven input-output maps, with the focus on pointwise prediction accuracy. We show that a PCE metamodel purely trained on data can yield pointwise predictions whose accuracy is comparable to that of other ML regression models, such as neural networks and support vector machines. The comparisons are performed on benchmark datasets available from the literature. The methodology also enables the quantification of the output uncertainties, and is robust to noise. Furthermore, it enjoys additional desirable properties, such as good performance for small training sets and simplicity of construction, with only little parameter tuning required.

AB We review a scalable two-and three-dimensional computer code for low-temperature plasma simulations in multi-material complex geometries. Our approach is based on embedded boundary (EB) finite volume discretizations of the minimal fluid-plasma model on adaptive Cartesian grids, extended to also account for charging of insulating surfaces. We discuss the spatial and temporal discretization methods, and show that the resulting overall method is second order convergent, monotone, and conservative (for smooth solutions). Weak scalability with parallel efficiencies over 70% are demonstrated up to 8192 cores and more than one billion cells. We then demonstrate the use of adaptive mesh refinement in multiple two-and three-dimensional simulation examples at modest cores counts. The examples include two-dimensional simulations of surface streamers along insulators with surface roughness; fully three-dimensional simulations of filaments in experimentally realizable pin-plane geometries, and three-dimensional simulations of positive plasma discharges in multi-material complex geometries. The largest computational example uses up to 800 million mesh cells with billions of unknowns on 4096 computing cores. Our use of computer-aided design (CAD) and constructive solid geometry (CSG) combined with capabilities for parallel computing offers possibilities for performing three-dimensional transient plasma-fluid simulations, also in multi-material complex geometries at moderate pressures and comparatively large scale.

Our scheme combines a generic, high order quadrature method for singular kernels called Quadrature by Expansion (QBX) with a modified version of the Fast Multipole Method (FMM). Our scheme extends a recently developed formulation of the FMM for QBX in two dimensions, which, in that setting, achieves mathematically rigorous error and running time bounds. In addition to generalization to three dimensions, we highlight some algorithmic and mathematical opportunities for improved performance and stability. Lastly, we give numerical evidence supporting the accuracy, performance, and scalability ofthe algorithm through a series of experiments involving the Laplace and Helmholtz equations.

AB A sharp immersed boundary computational aeroacoustic simulation approach for openrotor direct noise predictions is presented. A specific feature of the finite-difference based immersed boundary method is that the stencil coefficients in the vicinity of the immersed boundary are determined in such a way that the stability of the numerical scheme is improved. The characteristics of this immersed boundary method are discussed for acoustic scattering and the treatment of moving boundaries, such as accounting for freshly cleared and dead cells, efficient geometry queries and efficient computation of irregular boundary stencils and point clouds in the vicinity of the immersed boundary. It is shown that the numerical error when considering moving boundary problems consistently scales with the order of accuracy of the boundary discretization. Finally, the method is applied to simulate the flow around a contra-rotating open rotor at take-off and cruise conditions where experimental data is available for comparison. Excellent agreement for the noise predictions of the contra-rotating open rotor system are obtained between the numerical simulations and the experimental noise measurement. (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB The paradox of openness describes the fundamental tension between knowledge sharing and knowledge protection in open innovation. While sharing is vital for value creation, protecting is critical for value appropriation. Prior research has examined this paradox of openness from the perspective of the seeking firm, focusing on the firm-level challenges of inbound open innovation. In this article, we complement that research by illuminating the tensions between sharing and protecting in individual-level outbound open innovation, where we argue that the paradox of openness is most prevalent, yet much less well understood. Drawing on the experience of individual participants, or solvers, in intermediated crowdsourcing contests, we analyze textual data from 2,149 answers to five open-ended narrative questions embedded in a large-scale solver survey, as well as 43 in-depth interviews of solvers. Our findings indicate that individual solvers face fundamental sharing-protecting tensions that carry considerable economic and psychological costs. We also document how solvers attempt to navigate the paradox of openness by employing three formal and four informal value appropriation practices. They build elaborate configurations of these practices, which they tailor to the idiosyncrasies of each contest. They also dynamically adjust these configurations over time, as the contest and the interaction with the seeker unfold. We end by outlining how these findings contribute to a more multifaceted conceptualization and a richer understanding of the paradox of openness.

AB The use of trademark data in innovation studies is still limited because as yet no guidelines exist to ascertain which trademarks relate to innovation. This paper proposes that a branding strategy approach may help to identify innovation related trademarks. Companies use distinctive branding strategies for innovation and these branding strategies have important consequences for the design of new trademarks and their application scope. Based on a sample of Benelux and Community trademarks, we find that trademarks for brand creation relate more often to product innovation. In addition, we find negative effects of a trademark's industry scope on its relatedness to product innovation, and of a trademark's geographic scope on its relatedness to service innovation. Our findings bear several key implications for further research towards identifying innovation-related trademarks from a branding strategy perspective.

AB In the past few decades, much research has documented the importance of users as sources of innovations. Over the last 10 years, Research Policy alone has published 56 research articles investigating this phenomenon. We ask to what degree the findings of users as innovators have been absorbed by decision-makers responsible for new product development (managers) and by those who shape the contextual conditions for innovation (policy makers and public administration). A realistic perception of the sources of innovation is important as it constitutes the basis for a rational allocation of resources and thus indirectly impacts the innovation performance of companies and societies at large.
   In a large-scale survey of n = 1500 decision-makers, we found support for a substantial underestimation of users as a source of innovation: While the true proportion of user innovation among the most valuable 1678 innovations in nine industries is 54.4% (as established in existing research articles), decision-makers estimate it to be 21.7%. A content analysis of transfer media (450 academic textbooks, popular innovation books, and business articles) underscores this theory-practice gap: Of 3469 text paragraphs dealing with the sources of innovation, only 2.7% mention users as innovators. We develop six propositions on the reasons for and consequences of this underestimation that may serve as a starting point for future research and practical consequences.

AB This paper explores the complex relationship between scientific novelty and technological impact. We measure novel science as publications which make new combinations of prior knowledge, as reflected in new combinations of journals in their references, and trace links between science and technology by scientific references in patent applications. We draw on all the Web of Science SCIE journal articles published in 2001 and all the patents in PATSTAT (October 2013 edition). We find that the small proportion of scientific publications which score on novelty, particularly the 1% highly novel scientific publications in their field, are significantly and sizably more likely to have direct technological impact than comparable non-novel publications. In addition to this superior likelihood of direct impact, novel science also has a higher probability for indirect technological impact, being more likely to be cited by other scientific publications which have technological impact. Among the set of scientific publications cited at least once by patents, there are no additional significant differences in the speed or the intensity of the technological impact between novel and non-novel scientific prior art, but the technological impact from novel science is significantly broader and reaching new technology fields previously not impacted by its scientific discipline. Novel science is also more likely to lead to patents which are themselves novel.

AB While the role played by the state in stimulating innovation in the private sector has been a prevalent interest in innovation research, studies analysing the impacts of public interventions have usually focused on individual policies, programs or projects. Public stimulation is hence often studied from a relatively restricted and temporarily confined perspective, leaving a macro-level and longer-term perspective unrecognized. This article provides further evidence on the matter by examining how many innovations in Finland and Sweden have been publicly stimulated through funding or research collaboration, over a period of more than four decades (1970-2013). Our main source is a new innovation database constructed following the Literature Based Innovation Output (LBIO) method, which gathers the most significant innovations of both countries for the study period, totalling approximately 4100 Swedish and 2600 Finnish innovations. Our results indicate that the public sector has played a very prominent role in stimulating private innovation in both countries, and with an increasing trend. This is especially true for Finland, where 35-55% of the innovations of the period have been stimulated by public funding and 25-65% by collaboration with public research. In Sweden, the share of publicly stimulated innovations has been somewhat lower and erratic, but has increased over time.

AB We employ finely geo-coded firm-level panel data to assess the long-standing question whether agglomeration economies derive from specialization (within-industry), diversity (between-industry) or overall density. Rather than treating the city as a single unit, we focus our analysis on how the inner industry structures of cities influence firm-level productivity. Our results illustrate the co-existence of several externalities that differ in their spatial distribution and attenuation within cities. First, we find robust positive effects of neighborhood-level specialization on TFP as well as a small effect of diversity at the same fine spatial level. These effects are highly localized and dissipate beyond the immediate within-city neighborhood level. Second, we also find that firms benefit from the overall density of the wider city. The results emphasize the relevance of "opening up" cities to study the workings of their inner organization and support the idea that location in a within-city industry cluster in a diversified and dense city boosts productivity.

AB Firms are encouraged to continually initiate innovation activities as part of their new product development processes and to be open to the use of external knowledge sources. Yet, many are abandoned. Openness to external knowledge sources and the experience of abandoning innovation activities are, therefore, becoming a part of an organization's reality and innovation strategy. In this paper, we aim to explore how the experience of having abandoned an innovation activity can affect innovation performance and the role two key dimensions of openness, external search breadth and formal innovation collaboration breadth, play. Using data from the UK Innovation Survey, we find that the experience of having abandoned an innovation activity leads to improved innovation performance and that this is negatively moderated by the two dimensions of openness. When external search breadth is high, i.e. when an organization engages with a higher number of different types of knowledge sources, the link between abandoning innovation activities and innovation performance weakens. Similarly, when formal innovation collaboration breadth is high, i.e. the breadth of a firm's formal collaboration relationships is high, the link between abandoning innovation activities and innovation performance also weakens. We conclude by discussing the theoretical and practical implications of our findings.

AB This paper concerns the emergence and diffusion of radical innovations in the context of sustainability transitions. We confront the typical understanding in the Strategic Niche Management framework with an in-depth longitudinal case study of French modem tramways (1971-2016), which represents a particular technology class: local infrastructure systems. The case confirms the relevance of existing SNM-concepts, but also points to three pattern deviations: 1) incumbent actors from neighbouring regimes can play a leading role in the development of radical alternatives, 2) the early formulation of highly specific visions can effectively guide search paths (as opposed to a usual prescription about more open-ended approaches to foster innovative variety creation), and 3) particularly influential projects (which we call 'landmark projects') can decisively accelerate innovation developments. Exploring a greater variety of diffusion and transition patterns (based on temporal interactions of causal mechanisms and varying roles played by different actors) is a fruitful way forward for sustainability transitions research.

AB Successfully developed academic inventions have the potential to spawn new technological domains, form the basis of thriving business ventures, and improve the well-being of society. However, evaluating whether an early-stage scientific invention truly has such potential is extremely difficult, and financially backing such inventions is highly risky. And yet, organizations and their evaluators still back some of these inventions with resources for further development. We investigate this puzzle to pinpoint how and why evaluators decide to offer resource commitments at early stages, despite the red flags raised using standard evaluation criteria. Many academic inventions need these initial resources to dispel concerns regarding their commercial feasibility, so evaluators need to take a leap of faith with their support to prematurely avoid eliminating high-potential opportunities. We tested our theory using text analysis on nearly 700 invention evaluation reports written by a university's technology transfer experts. Our results revealed that evaluators backed inventions based on their feasibility (overcoming doubt and assessing maturity) and desirability (background familiarity and scientific complexity). Using the context of the research laboratory, our study insights can be applied to many management situations in which early-stage opportunities are assessed for resource commitments under high uncertainty.

ID INNOVATION; PATENTS; ORGANIZATION; MARKETS
AB This paper examines the determinants of university exclusive versus non-exclusive licenses. We specifically focus on the effect of the characteristics of the licensed invention (i.e. stage of development, specificity and appropriability). We rely on a unique and original dataset of 91 inventions contained in 62 intellectual property licensing contracts executed in the period of 2005-2014 by two leading French research universities. We cannot find a significant relation between the characteristics of the invention and the degree of exclusivity. In particular, as opposed to theoretical predictions, embryonic inventions are not significantly linked to more exclusive licenses and generic inventions are not significantly linked to non-exclusive licenses. Furthermore, inventions that are both generic and embryonic are not significantly linked to exclusive licenses per field of use. These results, although still exploratory, contribute to feed the discussion about the performance of university-industry technology transfer since they suggest that performance might be improved by taking more into account the characteristics of the licensed invention.

AB Accelerating innovation in clean energy technologies is a policy priority for governments around the world aiming to mitigate climate change and to provide affordable energy. Most research has focused on the role of governments financing R&D and steering market demand, but there is a more limited understanding of the role of direct government interactions with startups across all sectors. We propose and evaluate the value-creation mechanisms of network resources from different types of partners for startups, highlighting the unique resources of government partners for cleantech startups. We develop and analyze a novel dataset of 657 U.S. cleantech startups and 2,015 alliances with governments, firms, research organizations, and not-for-profit organizations from 2008 to 2012 and analyze short-term firm outcomes from the different alliances. Our findings highlight the importance of governmental partners in technology development alliances to catalyze cleantech startup innovation (the patenting activity of cleantech startups increases by 73.7 percent with every additional governmental technology alliance when compared to those startups that did not engage in such alliances) and as quality signals to private sector investors for licensing alliances (private financing deals increase by 155 percent for every additional license from a government organization). Overall, these findings extend the alliance perspectives on innovation, contribute to the emerging research on entrepreneurial ecosystems, and underline the need to develop empirical evidence in different sectors.

AB Product innovation is widely thought to benefit from collaboration with both scientific and supply-chain partners. The combination of exploration and exploitation capacity, and of scientific and experience-based knowledge, are expected to yield multiplicative effects. However, the assumption that scientific and supply-chain collaboration are complementary and reinforce firm-level innovation has not been examined empirically. This paper tests this assumption on an unbalanced panel sample of 8337 firm observations in Norway, covering the period 2006-2010. The results of the econometric analysis go against the orthodoxy. They show that Norwegian firms do not benefit from doing "more of all" on their road to innovation. While individually both scientific and supply-chain collaboration improve the chances of firm-level innovation, there is a significant negative interaction between them. This implies that scientific and supply-chain collaboration, in contrast to what has been often highlighted, are substitutes rather than complements. The results are robust to the introduction of different controls and hold for all tested innovation outcomes: product innovation, new-to-market product innovation, and share of turnover from new products.

In particular, we demonstrate how multiple funding channels can be studied by bringing together two disparate datasets: UMETRICS, which is based on university payroll and financial records, and the Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED), which is one of the most important US survey datasets about the doctoral workforce. We show how it is possible to link data on research funding and the doctorally qualified workforce to describe how many individuals are supported in different disciplines and by different agencies. We outline the potential for more work as the UMETRICS data expands to incorporate more linkages and more access is provided.

AB In this work we exploit a long-in-time panel of Spanish manufacturing firms observed during the period 1990-2012 to examine the long-run contribution of innovation persistence to sales growth and market share dynamics. We examine two main research questions. First, do persistent innovators grow more than other firms? Second, do persistent innovators show more persistent growth patterns over time compared to other firms? We find negative answers to both questions: firms that persistently innovate over the first decade, do not grow more and do not display more persistent growth dynamics in the succeeding years, regardless of whether innovation persistence is defined in terms of R&D, patenting activity, or product or process innovation. These findings lend support to luck and random theories of firm growth, in turn challenging innovation persistence theories commonly suggesting that persistent innovators enjoy large and sustained comparative advantages.

AB There are many means by which editors can inappropriately manipulate journal impact factors, but questions remain as to whether these potentially inappropriate behaviors actually influence these scores to an empirically meaningful degree, and which academic disciplines are most culpable. In this manuscript, we propose a game-theoretic/information-asymmetry model that suggests manipulation is reinforced by a feedback loop that creates incentives for manipulation to spread and for disciplines to specialize in the type of manipulation used. We empirically investigate these hypotheses for four different manipulation strategies; coercive citation, self-serving review articles, editorials, and online queuing. Results show that all four of these techniques are effective, they inflate JIF scores and the h-index, and a significant part of that effect is due to inflated self-citations. We also find journals within disciplines tend to specialize in which technique they most frequently employ. Moreover, we show that disciplines are also interconnected, tied together by a journal cross-discipline content network and that disciplines that share more content also tend to rely more heavily on the same JIF influencing behaviors. Effective policy needs to change the editorial decision calculation by removing the benefits of manipulation; removing self-citations from journal metric calculations drastically reduces those benefits.

AB This paper analyses how differences in the industry composition of British local labour markets moderate the impact of foreign technological competition in manufacturing on domestic employment, both overall and across subsamples of workers with different skill levels (high, intermediate and low). To this scope, it exploits both variations across industries in the exposure to the introduction of new technologies, and information on how such industries are combined in shaping the industrial structure of each place. The analysis shows that places that specialise in industries undergoing substantial technological competition due to foreign innovation experience a reduction in total employment that is 4.5% larger than places less exposed based on their initial industry mix. This negative performance is mainly explained by a decrease in the employment opportunities for intermediate-skilled workers. Limited support is found for successful adaptation trajectories over time across British local labour markets.

AB We investigate the relationship between a firm's compensation structure and the extent to which its innovation is more exploration versus exploitation oriented. Specifically, we assess two aspects of a firm's compensation design horizontal dispersion within job levels and vertical tournament incentives between job levels. A six-year panel of compensation records of 671,028 employees working at 81 U.S.-based high technology firms between 1997 and 2002 are used to construct measures that characterize a firm's pay structure, which are linked to these firms' patents filed in the U.S. We find that firms with higher-powered tournament incentives in vertical compensation structure report higher fraction of innovation directed towards exploration. Horizontal pay dispersion, on the other hand, shows a negative relationship with the exploration in firms where R&D employees' age variance is low. In firms where R&D employees' age variance is high, the negative relationship between horizontal pay dispersion and exploration is muted.

AB Female researchers have lower probability than male researchers of being accepted into the largest national research support program in Uruguay. Age, scientific productivity, teaching activities and previous applications explains 5.2 percentage points of the 7.1 point gender acceptance probability gap. The remaining 1.9% can be attributed to gender discrimination. This phenomenon is stronger at the top 2 levels (out of 4) of the program evidencing glass ceilings. Results are robust to issues of simultaneity (research productivity affecting probability of being accepted and vice versa), joint determination and correlation of variables and productivity effects at early stages of career development. The paper tests four hypotheses that are likely to produce a glass ceiling in any R&D incentive schemes: male overrepresentation in the initial setup of the program, male overrepresentation on evaluation committees and two types of field-level effects (a pure composition effect without discrimination and differentiated discriminatory effects by fields). We show evidence of gender bias in the initial setup of the program and bias in the gender structure of committees. Nevertheless, these hypotheses have little quantitative power to explain the glass ceiling. The pure field composition effect is also not important. We find solid evidence of glass ceilings in the three areas where women are most active: health-related sciences, natural sciences and humanities. On the other hand, we find no such effects in social sciences, agricultural sciences or engineering.

Our study differentiates two types of team technology-related diversity technological dissimilarity and technological variety, and investigates their influences on the impact of an invention created by a team. Analyses of over half million U.S. utility patents in the 1991-2005 period invented by teams reveal that technological variety of team inventors has a positive effect on invention impact, and that technological dissimilarity between team inventors plays both positive and negative roles, eliciting an inverted U-shaped effect. In addition, we find that the positive effect of dissimilarity is significantly reduced after controlling for variety. Theoretical and practical implications of our findings are discussed.

AB Vietnam is an important case for studying the impact of foreign firms' backward linkages on local firms' productivity. As an emerging economy Vietnam became the second most popular FDI destination after China in Pacific Asia since 2014. Our empirical analysis for Vietnam as a whole demonstrates a significant difference in the productivity growth between domestic suppliers who have a direct linkage with foreign firms and non suppliers. This is also true for the Southeast Region (SE) with Ho-Chi-Minh City as economic center. However, in the Red River Delta (RRD), that difference is not statistically significant. Based on in-depth interviews with domestic suppliers, we reveal that in the RRD, effects of foreign firms on the productivity upgrading of domestic suppliers arc indirect and limited while internal factors like absorptive capacity are more important for the productivity growth. These regional differences can be traced back to different regional specializations which still persist from the pre-reform era.

AB This paper addresses the question of how firms accomplish the strategic task of adapting their entire set of IORs (interorganizational relationships) to changing environmental conditions. To study this, we move beyond the focus on collaboration with individual partners (the dyadic perspective) that has been the dominant emphasis in the literature until now. Instead, we view the firms' portfolios through the lens of the different modes of IOR engaged in (licensing agreements, non-equity alliances, venture capital investments, minority investments, joint ventures, and mergers & and acquisitions). We study the role of environmental change within the high-tech setting of the bio-pharmaceutical industry and distinguish between industry technological change and firm specific technological change. In doing so, we rely on prospect theory to theorize how firms' perceptions of environmental change in terms of a looming loss or a potential gain affect their risk-bearing, how this leads them to adjust their IOR portfolio diversity, and how these adjustments get implemented at the mode level. Whereas most of our hypotheses were confirmed by the study, a key unexpected finding was that firms respond to both types of technological change through stronger forms of adaptation than theoretically anticipated. Firms adapt to industry technological change through an increase in the diversity of their portfolio of IORs and by churning it up, which leads to a loosening of control at the individual mode level but greater adaptivity at the portfolio level. When facing firm-specific change instead, they adapt by reducing portfolio diversity, while cutting back on collaboration across five out of the six modes. Our findings both contribute to the literature on organizational adaptation, interfirm collaboration, and IOR portfolios and provide a greater behavioral understanding of network change.

AB Given a social network of users with non-uniform selection cost, and a fixed budget, which nodes should be chosen for initial activation to maximize the influence in the network, such that the total selection cost does not exceed the budget? This problem is known as the Budgeted Influence Maximization Problem or BIM Problem, in short. Though the problem appears to be realistic one, there are very few studies available in the literature. In this paper, we propose ComBIM, a community-based solution approach for solving the BIM problem. The proposed methodology has four steps: first, community detection to understand the inherent structure of the social network, second, budget distribution to divide the total budget among the communities based on the number of nodes and their selection costs, third, seed selection for influence maximization and finally, budget transfer, in which unutilized budget of one community is transferred to another community. We implement the proposed methodology with three publicly available social network datasets. We have compared the obtained results with that of other methodologies from the literature and observe that ComBIM can achieve the better influence spread, while taking reasonable time for seed set selection.

AB Offline writer independent (WI) signature verification is conceivably a challenging task in the domain of handwritten biometrics. This work addresses it by introducing a feature extraction scheme that relies on the detection of first order transitions between asymmetrical lattice arrangements of simple pixel structures. The experiments are conducted with a decision stumps committee, accompanied with boosting feature selection, by employing only unrelated or blind training and testing datasets, all derived from four widely used signature databases. In addition, a fifth signature dataset which contains disguised signatures, originating from a signature verification contest, is also used for testing purposes. The impact of the preprocessing stage per dataset is exploited by allowing various pruning levels of the raw binary signature. In addition to standard training protocols, we introduce the use of the applicability domain (AD) in WI signature verification and examine its effectiveness in providing reliable classifier predictions by quantifying subregions of the input distance space that have been sufficiently covered by training examples. The derived experimental results expressed by means of equal error rate, along with best average error rate, are considered to be very competitive to those provided from state of the art WI methods.

ID MICROARRAY DATA; SELECTION; VALIDATION
AB In unsupervised learning, the problem of finding the appropriate number of clusters-usually notated as k- is very challenging. Its importance lies in the fact that k is a vital hyperparameter for the most clustering algorithms. One algorithmic approach for tacking this problem is to apply a certain clustering algorithm with various cluster configurations and decide to use the one that maximizes a certain internal validity measure. This is a promising and computationally efficient approach since the independent runs are parallelizable. In this paper, we attempt to improve over this estimation approach by incorporating a consensus clustering approach into k estimating scheme. The weighted consensus clustering scheme employs four different indices namely Silhouette (SH), Calinski-Harabasz (CH), Davies-Bouldin (DB), and Consensus (CI) indices to estimate the correct number of cluster. Computational experiments in a dataset with clusters ranging from 2 to 7 show the profound advantages of weighted consensus clustering for correctly finding k in comparison to individual clustering method (e.g, k-means) and simple consensus clustering.

AB This paper addresses the mixed no-idle flowshop scheduling problem with sequence-dependent setup times and total flowtime minimisation. In the mixed no-idle flowshop problem, machines that allow idleness coexist with stages that require uninterrupted processing. We studied an extension of this problem, which considers sequence-dependent setup times in machines where idleness is allowed. We present a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model for the new problem. We also provide a method to evaluate the total flowtime of a permutation sequence. Furthermore, an acceleration method to calculate the total flowtime in an insertion neighbourhood is proposed. A new set of efficient heuristics were developed. In order to evaluate the proposed methods we adapted the best known heuristics available from related problems. The adapted heuristics, as well as the methods proposed here, were tested and compared through statistical and computational experimentation in an extensive benchmark with 4500 instances. We also compared the proposed heuristics with the optimal solutions found by the MILP formulation for small sized problems instances. The results demonstrate that the proposed heuristics perform extremely well in terms of solution quality and computational efficiency. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Pattern mining is an important data mining technology. The existing pattern mining algorithms mainly focus on discovery of ordinary patterns in databases, for example, frequent pattern mining finds patterns with high frequencies and utility pattern mining discovers patterns with high utilities. However, in many real-world applications, people are more interested in finding extraordinary patterns with low frequencies and high utilities or with high frequencies and low utilities. While mining ordinary patterns is computationally hard, it is even harder to mine extraordinary patterns. In particular, a two-phase approach that first generates and materializes candidates (high-frequency patterns or high-utility patterns) and then finds extraordinary patterns from the candidates, suffers from the scalability and efficiency bottlenecks.
   This paper proposes an efficient algorithm for mining extraordinary patterns. The novelty of our algorithm lies in newly proposed lower bounds both on frequencies and on utilities of patterns, new pruning strategies and new predicting strategies for dramatically reducing the search space, and a novel data structure for efficient computation. The proposed algorithm employs a single-phase approach without materializing candidates, and also adapts the upper bounds on supports and on utilities for pruning. Extensive experiments show that the new pruning and predicting strategies are effective, and the proposed algorithm is efficient and scalable. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In most of the consensus models for multi-attribute group decision making (MAGDM), the decision makers are required to provide evaluation information in given expression domains under the same evaluation attributes, which cannot well represent the heterogeneity of evaluation information and the differences of decision makers to meet the realistic requirements. In this work, we propose a consensus model for heterogeneous MAGDM with several attribute sets, in which each decision maker can independently choose evaluation attributes, set attribute weights, express evaluation information, and then decision makers can reach an agreement through a consensus reaching process. The key of the proposed model is to transform the individual heterogeneous evaluation attributes of each decision maker into corresponding two homogeneous evaluation attributes, i.e. the distance from the alternatives to the Positive Ideal Solution (PIS) and the distance from the alternatives to the Negative Ideal Solution (NIS). More specifically, every evaluation attribute of each decision maker is regarded as a small module. Then, the heterogeneous TOPSIS method is used to calculate the separation from NIS and proximity to PIS of alternatives in small modules and aggregate these distances under different attributes of the same alternative using attribute weights for each decision maker; then, consensus process and selection process are implemented via the new homogeneous evaluation attributes of alternatives for decision makers. Two case studies illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Smart cruise control (SCC) is one of the representative systems of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). Conventional SCC systems have a problem in that they cannot detect a cut-in vehicle in a short distance because the field of view (FOV) of their sensors for detecting vehicles ahead is limited. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a novel method using surround view monitoring (SVM) cameras which can observe the surroundings of a host vehicle without blind spots. To reduce the variation of projected appearance according to the relative position, this paper proposes to exploit multiple virtual camera images (rotational images). In each rotational image, vehicles are detected using a part-based method: tires are detected and then vehicles are detected by combining the tires. Detected tires in multiple rotational images are integrated and tracked in 3D space. Finally, the proposed method determines whether a vehicle has intruded into the cut-in zone based on the position and orientation of the vehicle. The proposed method succeeds to detect vehicle even by a simple method thanks to the rotational image even without any special HAW. The proposed method uses only the sensor adopted in mass-produced vehicles and it is very practical. Moreover, the method can estimate the surrounding vehicle position accurately enough to be used in the braking control system. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated with various driving situations, of which the total length is 447.8 min (43.5 min for the test track and 404.3 min for natural driving). Among 211 cut-in events, 208 events are correctly warned and only 3 false warnings occur. Although the proposed method simultaneously processes the rotational images generated from three SVM cameras (forward, left, and right), the average processing time per frame takes about 58 ms.

AB In a decision-making process, a decision maker is often able to express his/her preferences of importance of the evaluative criteria only linguistically. These linguistic terms can be expressed as triangular fuzzy numbers. To make a decision about the set of alternatives that are evaluated by differently important criteria, a method of decision-making theory can be applied. Many theories do not accept criteria importance in the format of fuzzy numbers, which means that fuzzy numbers must be transformed into criteria weights. For this purpose, not many methods are known. Based on a literature review, Lai and Hwang's optimization approach is selected because this method has least number of shortcomings. Therefore, this method is researched in more detail. The specified problems with the optimization model are eliminated by the proposed improvements and a new comprehensive fuzzy weights estimation method is introduced. Some proposals are explained through illustrative examples. Easy applicability of the proposed method is demonstrated on a real case of making a portfolio of open unit trusts. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Image segmentation is among the most important techniques in image processing, and many methods have been developed to perform this task. This paper presents a new multi-objective metaheuristic based on a multi-verse optimization algorithm to segment grayscale images via multi-level thresholding. The proposed approach involves finding an approximate Pareto-optimal set by maximizing the Kapur and Otsu objective functions. Both Kapur's and Otsu's methods are highly used for image segmentation performed by means of bi-level and multi-level thresholding. However, each of them has certain characteristics and limitations. Several metaheuristic approaches have been proposed in the literature to separately optimize these objective functions in terms of accuracy, whereas only a few multi-objective approaches have explored the benefits of the joint use of Kapur and Otsu's methods. However, the computational cost of Kapur and Otsu is high and their accuracy needs to be improved. The proposed method, called Multi-objective Multi-verse Optimization, avoids these limitations. It was tested using 11 natural grayscale images and its performance was compared against three of well-known multi-objective algorithms. The results were analyzed based on two sets of measures, one to assess the performance of the proposed method as a multi-objective algorithm, and the other to evaluate the accuracy of the segmented images. The results showed that the proposed method provides a better approximation to the optimal Pareto Front than the other algorithms in terms of hypervolume and spacing. Moreover, the quality of its segmented image is better than those of the other methods in terms of uniformity measures. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE Machine learning; Malware; Encrypted malware; Feature analysis
AB In recent years there has been a dramatic increase in the number of malware attacks that use encrypted HTTP traffic for self-propagation or communication. Antivirus software and firewalls typically will not have access to encryption keys, and therefore direct detection of malicious encrypted data is unlikely to succeed. However, previous work has shown that traffic analysis can provide indications of malicious intent, even in cases where the underlying data remains encrypted. In this paper, we apply three machine learning techniques to the problem of distinguishing malicious encrypted HTTP traffic from benign encrypted traffic and obtain results comparable to previous work. We then consider the problem of feature analysis in some detail. Previous work has often relied on human expertise to determine the most useful and informative features in this problem domain. We demonstrate that such feature-related information can be obtained directly from machine learning models themselves. We argue that such a machine learning based approach to feature analysis is preferable, as it is more reliable, and we can, for example, uncover relatively unintuitive interactions between features.

ID SOFTWARE DEFECT PREDICTION
AB Data mining techniques are intensively used to uncover relevant patterns in large volumes of complex data which are continuously extended with newly arrived data instances. Relational association rules (RARs), a data analysis and mining concept, have been introduced as an extension of classical association rules (ARs) for capturing various relationships between the attributes characterizing the data. Due to its NP-completeness, the problem of mining all the interesting RARs within a data set is computationally difficult. As the dimensionality of the data set to be mined increases, the classical algorithm Discovery of Relational Association Rules (DRAR) for RARs mining fails in providing the set of rules in reasonable time. This paper introduces a new approach named CRAR (Concurrent Relational Association Rule mining) which uses concurrency for the RARs discovery process and thus significantly reduces the mining time. The effectiveness of CRAR is empirically validated on nine open source data sets. The reduction in mining time when using CRAR against DRAR emphasizes that it can be successfully applied in various practical data mining scenarios. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A large amount of unstructured textual data about geoscience structures and minerals is buried in geoscience documents and is unused. Automatic keyphrase extraction provides opportunities to leverage this wealth of data for analysis and knowledge discovery. However, keyphrase extraction remains a complicated task, and the performance of state-of-the-art approaches is still low. Automatic discovery of high quality and meaningful keyphrases requires the application of useful knowledge and suitable techniques.
   Seeing both challenges and opportunities in the situation described above, this paper proposes an ontology and enhanced word embedding-based (OEWE) methodology for automatic keyphrase extraction from geoscience documents. We first develop a quantitative analysis for keyphrase extraction evaluation based on conditional probability and the naive Bayesian model, which is valuable when human-annotated keyphrases are not available. The domain ontology is then performed on a multiway tree to enrich the domain-specific knowledge on certain concepts and relationships in a domain. Simultaneously, word2vec, a model of a word distribution using deep learning, is updated by applying the geological ontology, and it links domain background information and identifies infrequent but representative keyphrases. We use two homemade geoscience datasets to evaluate the performance of OEWE. We compare our method with frequency, term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF), TextRank and rapid automatic keyword extraction (RAKE), finding that our method achieves average Fl scores of 30.1% and 40.7% on two manually annotated datasets.

AB One of the concepts that has gained important attention from economic and management-science research is that of the concept of returns to scale (RTS). There are several research papers on the behavior of the right and left RTS, as two specific directions of RTS, based on Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) models. However, the main weakness of most of these methods is that they are based on the defined parameters, which itself leads to a high sensitivity of the models to variations in the magnitudes of the parameters and, thus, unreliable results. In this paper, we specially address this issue and propose a simple procedure for detecting the right and left RTS classification with an important feature that is independent of any predetermined parameters. In addition to the type of RTS, we also suggest a method to determine the value of the right and left RTS corresponding to each of the efficient DMUs. Finally, the superiority of the proposed parameter-free procedure over a parameter-based methods is elaborated by a real case in the banking system. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB When investing in financial markets it is crucial to determine a trading signal that can provide the investor with the best entry and exit points of the financial market, however this is a difficult task and has become a very popular research topic in the financial area. This paper presents an expert system in the financial area that combines Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and a Multi-Objective Optimization Genetic Algorithm (MOO-GA) in order to achieve high returns with a low level of risk. PCA is used to reduce the dimensionality of the financial input data set and the DWT is used to perform a noise reduction to every feature. The resultant data set is then fed to an XGBoost binary classifier that has its hyperparameters optimized by a MOO-GA. The importance of the PCA is analyzed and the results obtained show that it greatly improves the performance of the system. In order to improve even more the results obtained in the system using PCA, the PCA and the DWT are then applied together in one system and the results obtained show that this system is capable of outperforming the Buy and Hold (B&H) strategy in three of the five analyzed financial markets, achieving an average rate of return of 49.26% in the portfolio, while the B&H achieves on average 32.41%.

AB Electric vehicles (EV) have received considerable attention in recent years due to their low operating cost, potential for energy sustainability, and zero tailpipe emissions. This study presents a novel two stage stochastic programming model integrating long- and short-term decisions to design and manage EV charging stations with renewable energy generation capability. The model captures the non-linear load congestion effect that increases exponentially as the electricity consumed by plugged-in EVs approaches the capacity of the charging station and linearizes it. The study proposes a hybrid decomposition algorithm that utilizes a Sample Average Approximation and an enhanced Progressive Hedging algorithm (PHA) inside a Constraint Generation algorithmic framework to efficiently solve the proposed optimization model. A case study based on Washington, D.C. is presented to visualize and validate the modeling results. Computational experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in solving the problem in a practical amount of time. Finding of the study include that incorporating the load congestion factor encourages the opening of large-sized charging stations, increases the number of stored batteries, and that higher congestion costs call for a decrease in the opening of new charging stations.

AB This study proposes an analysis framework for recommending untapped mergers and acquisitions (M&A) opportunities by combining principal component analysis (PCA) and collaborative filtering. The framework is particularly suitable for suggesting M&A targets that may possess the complementary knowledge resources for improving performance gains. In this study, PCA was firstly applied to reduce the dimensionality of original data and to identify key knowledge categories of firms. Based on these results, the potential knowledge requirements and priority areas of firm's knowledge base can be located. Collaborative filtering technique was then adopted to a firm's knowledge portfolio, which is represented as a set of SIC (standard industrial classification) codes, for making recommendations. The applicability of the framework was demonstrated using a case study approach based on the analysis of the biotechnology M&A market. The proposed framework would be a good complement to existing practice of identifying novel M&A opportunities and can create a basis for constructing a data-driven business intelligence system. From an expert and intelligent systems point of view, the study provides decision makers with a general and flexible modeling approach for assisting them in the formulation of M&A strategy. It enlarges the possibility of decomposing the problem into manageable units by automating the emulation of human decision making. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID FEATURE-SELECTION; GENETIC ALGORITHM
AB Metric learning, which aims to determine an appropriate distance function to measure the similarity and dissimilarity between data points accurately, is one of the most popular methods to enhance the performance of many machine learning methods such as K-means clustering and K nearest neighbor classifier algorithms. These algorithms may not perform well because of the use of normal Euclidean distance function that ignores any statistical regularities that might be estimated from a large training set of labeled examples. In many real-world applications, the Euclidean distance may not be fit to capture the intrinsic similarity and dissimilarity between the data points. Compared to existing metric learning algorithms, which use large amount of labeled data in the form of must-link (ML) and cannot-link constraints as side information where the granularity of true clustering is unknown, our proposed approach uses few labeled data in the form of relative-distance constraints such as equality constraints, C-eq, and inequality constraints, C-neq. For satisfying such constraints, we need to project the initial Euclidean distance matrix by using Bregman projection on the convex subset of constraints in such a way that all the constraints are satisfied. Since Bregman projection is not orthogonal, means while satisfying the current constraint previously satisfied constraints may get unsatisfied, we need to select a proper subset of constraints for learning better distance function. The multi-objective framework is utilized for selecting a good subset of constraints which can help in getting the proper labeling of the data set. The selected subset of constraints is used for adjusting the initial kernel-matrix. K-means clustering technique is applied to the adjusted kernel matrix to label the data set. In order to evaluate the quality of obtained labeling, different external and internal cluster validity indices are deployed. The values of these indices are simultaneously optimized using the search capability of MOO with the aim of selecting the appropriate subset of constraints. The proposed approach is evaluated on UCI Human Activity Recognition using Smartphone Dataset v1.0 along with nine other popular data sets. Results show that our approach outperforms the state of the art semi-supervised metric learning algorithms with respect to different internal and external cluster validity indices.

AB Identifying a group of influential nodes in social networks help us understand the hierarchical structure of the network and make a better control the spread of information. Moreover, it can offer guidance in avoiding the breakdown of the power system and the Internet, identifying drug targets and essential proteins. Undoubtedly, most of the influence measures suffer the low resolution. The same score corresponds to multiple nodes. What's worse is that the effect of overlapping between nodes is not fully considered. It causes resource waste in node selection. The purpose of this paper is to identify a set of distributed nodes with the strong propagation ability. Inspired by the interplay between the individuals and groups from sociological and complex networks, we propose a node ranking method based on the social conformity theory and community feature based on VoteRank. This proposed method calculates the node influence capability from two points of view, one is the individual, the other is the group. From the point of the individual, it quantifies the attractive power of the nodes with the feature of their neighbors based on the theory of conformity. It can distinguish the nodes with the same degree and similar structure. From the other point, it measures the initiating power with the scale of the community and the relative location of the node. Furthermore, a node selection strategy based on information coverage and community tightness is proposed to solve the problem of overlapping. Finally, node attractive power, initiating power and the node selection strategy are combined to improve VoteRank. The experimental results on real-world networks show the effectiveness of our methods. The results also explains that the enormous energy from the groups makes the node powerful.

   Electroencephalograms (EEG)
AB Electroencephalographic (EEG) signals have been widely used in medical applications, yet the use of EEG signals as user identification systems for healthcare and Internet of Things (loT) systems has only gained interests in the last few years. The advantages of EEG-based user identification systems lie in its dynamic property and uniqueness among different individuals. However, it is for this reason that manually designed features are not always adapted to the needs. Therefore, a novel approach based on 1D Convolutional Long Short-term Memory Neural Network (1D-Convolutional LSTM) for EEG-based user identification system is proposed in this paper. The performance of the proposed approach was validated with a public database consists of EEG data of 109 subjects. The experimental results showed that the proposed network has a very high averaged accuracy of 99.58%, when using only 16 channels of EEG signals, which outperforms the state-of-the-art EEG-based user identification methods. The combined use of CNNs and LSTMs in the proposed 1D-Convolutional LSTM can greatly improve the accuracy of user identification systems by utilizing the spatiotemporal features of the EEG signals with LSTM, and lowering cost of the systems by reducing the number of EEG electrodes used in the systems.

AB Increasing the rate of material identification, separation and recovery is a priority in resource management and recovery, and rapid, low cost imaging and interpretation is key. This study uses different combinations of cameras, illuminations and data augmentation techniques to create databases of images to train deep neural networks for the recognition of fibre materials. Using a limited set of 24 material samples sized 1200 cm(2), it compares the outcome of reducing them to 30 cm2. The best classification accuracies obtained range from 76.6% to 77.5% indicating it is possible to overcome problems such as limited available materials, time, or storage capabilities, by using a setup with 5 cameras, 5 lights and applying simple software image manipulation techniques. The same method can be used to create deep neural network training databases to recognise a wider range of materials typically found in solid waste streams, in real-time. Furthermore, it offers flexibility as the classification cameras could be deployed at different stages within solid waste processing plants, providing feedback for process control, with the potential of increasing plant efficiency and reducing costs.

AB Learning visual representations plays an important role in computer vision and machine learning applications. It facilitates a model to understand and perform high-level tasks intelligently. A common approach for learning visual representations is supervised one which requires a huge amount of human annotations to train the model. This paper presents a self-supervised approach which learns visual representations from input images without human annotations. We learn the correct arrangement of object proposals to represent an image using a convolutional neural network (CNN) without any manual annotations. We hypothesize that the network trained for solving this problem requires the embedding of semantic visual representations. Unlike existing approaches that use uniformly sampled patches, we relate object proposals that contain prominent objects and object parts. More specifically, we discover the representation that considers overlap, inclusion, and exclusion relationship of proposals as well as their relative position. This allows focusing on potential objects and parts rather than on clutter. We demonstrate that our model outperforms existing self-supervised learning methods and can be used as a generic feature extractor by applying it to object detection, classification, action recognition, image retrieval, and semantic matching tasks.
