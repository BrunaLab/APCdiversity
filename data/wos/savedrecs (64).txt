AB The aim of this study was to investigate application of fish protein hydrolysates (FPHs) as cryoprotectants for cod fish mince subjected to freeze-thaw abuse. Response surface methodology revealed little difference in cryoprotectant ability between FPHs produced from Pacific hake muscle within the range of conditions studied, namely Flavourzyme (R) enzyme/substrate ratio (E/S 1-4%), time (1-6 h) and pH (5-7). When added at 4% or higher concentrations, FPH minimized expressible moisture and cook loss, while maximizing salt extractable protein from freeze-thaw abused fish mince, providing similar or better cryoprotection compared to an 8% sucrose-sorbitol blend, and a stabilizing effect of FPH on myosin was observed by differential scanning calorimetry. Sensory evaluation showed that addition of 8% FPH in fish ball products increased the perception of fishiness, saltiness, bitterness and firmness while decreasing moistness. FPH could be a viable alternative to the sugar-based cryoprotectants currently used for frozen fish products. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Milk is the largest source of iodine in UK diets and earlier studies showed organic summer and winter milk to be significantly lower in iodine than conventional milk. One study also showed UHT milk to have lower iodine concentration. The study on winter and UHT milk was small and accordingly a new study is reported here involving conventional, organic and UHT semi-skimmed milk from four supermarkets over a six-month period in summer and winter in two regions of the UK. The results showed organic milk to be 44% lower in iodine than conventional milk (427 vs. 241 mu g/L, P < 0.001) and UHT milk was 27% lower in iodine than conventional milk (427 vs. 314 mu g/L, P < 0.001) although the differences tended to be less in the summer. The results indicate that replacement of conventional milk by organic or UHT milk will increase the risk of sub-optimal iodine status especially for pregnant/lactating women. (C) 2017 The Author(s).

AB This study evaluated the effects of electrolyzed oxidizing (EO) water treatment on the removal of pesticide residues (diazinon, cyprodinil and phosmet) from spinach, snap beans and grapes, and the effect on produce quality. High available chlorine content (ACC) and long treatment time of EO water resulted in high pesticide removals. Up to 59.2, 66.5 and 37.1% of diazinon; 43.8, 50.0 and 31.5% of cyprodinil; 85.7, 73.0 and 49.4% of phosmet; were removed from spinach, snap beans and grapes, respectively, after 15 min EO water treatment at 120 mg/l ACC. EO water was also more effective than electrolyzed reduced water, bleach, VegWash and DI water on pesticide removal. In addition, no significant colour or texture deterioration were found on produce samples treated with EO water. It was concluded, EO water can be very effective in pesticide residue removal from fresh produce without affecting the produce quality. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Peanut is a potent natural source of phytochemical compounds and is associated with human health. In the present study, we determined the biological activity and chemical constituents of peanuts germinated for 0-9 days. The ungerminated seed coat exhibited the highest antioxidant potential, phenolic compound content and anti-inflammatory activity. During the germination process, on the first germination day, root extract showed the highest antioxidant potential, phenolic compound content and anti-inflammatory activity. The kernel exhibited a low phenolic compound content and antioxidant activity at the early stage of germination and significantly increased after 9 days of germination. Resveratrol increased to 7.19 +/- 0.07 mu g/g dry weight on the second day of germination. LC-MS/MS showed a variety of phenolic compounds and stilbene derivatives in different parts of germinated peanut. These results suggest that the peanut sprout exerts high anti-inflammatory effects that may be related to the polyphenolic content and antioxidant properties. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Sudan I is a carcinogenic industrial azo-dye, forbidden for use in food. However, it has been detected in food on several occasions, such as in paprika, used in animal husbandry to enhance egg yolk colour. Therefore, an animal experiment was designed to simulate the transfer of Sudan I to eggs after its unintentional administration to laying hens. A group of laying hens (n = 18) received feed contaminated with Sudan I at the raising concentrations: 0.45 mg/kg, 4.97 mg/kg and 42.1 mg/kg. Residues of Sudan I were detected in egg yolks (0.29 +/- 0.03 mu g/kg, mean +/- SD) only after the administration of the feed contaminated with the dye at the highest concentration. The determined concentrations were much lower than expected based on the compound's lipophilicity. In conclusion, the transfer of Sudan I to eggs was limited and strongly dependent on its concentration in feed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, magnetic graphene/mesoporous silica composites with boronic acid-functionalized pore-walls were synthesized for the first time by a two-step post-graft method. The obtained nano-composites were proven to hold many attractive features such as large specific surface area, uniform mesopores, high magnetic responsibility, and boronic acid-functionalized inner pore-walls. Aminoglycoside residues in milk were extracted using MG@mSiO(2)-APB composites as restricted access matrix dispersive solid phase extraction adsorbents through the interaction between boronic acid groups and glucoside structures. Extraction conditions were optimized by studying the SPE parameters. Limits of detection of the method were as low as 5 ng mL(-1) for streptomycin) and 2 ng mL(-1) for dihydrostreptomycin. Finally, magnetic graphene/mesoporous silica composites with boronic acid-functionalized pore-walls were successfully applied to residue analysis in milk samples. Compared to the traditional extraction methods, using this nano-composites for aminoglycoside residues analysis in milk is more sensitive, effective and convenient. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Pentacyclic triterpenes are minor, but very relevant compounds found in virgin olive oil (VOO). A rapid and reliable LC-MS method for determining the triterpenic acids and dialcohols (after ultrasound assisted extraction) from VOO has been developed, giving an alternative to the widely used GC (FID/MS) methodologies. The analytical parameters of the proposed method were exhaustively checked, establishing limits of detection (from 1 to 95 mu g/l) and quantification, precision (RSD values for inter-day repeatability were found between 4.2 and 7.3% considering area values), trueness (within the range 92.7 and 100.5%) and evaluating possible matrix effect (which was no significant). The method was applied to the analysis of six triterpenic compounds in 11 monovarietal VOOs and the results compared with the quantitative GC-MS data. Moreover, the direct injection (after a simple dilution) of the samples into the LC-MS system was also tested, in an attempt to proffer an even simpler sample treatment. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The large variety of fish formats which are globally commercialized supports use of meta-evaluation studies to test discrimination power among molecular keys available for traceability of highly-degraded and/or chemically-modified DNA material. This paper shows that a combination of DNA identification methods validated for genus Merluccius allows 100% species assignment in hake products and offers higher diagnostic power (97% on products) than individual methods, i.e. Hake-ITS1-RFLP (89%) or Hake-Cytochrome b-RFLP (83%). A global 31% product mislabelling involved 15% of products affected by internal species substitution, as the main cause of mislabelling in ultrafrozen products, and another 16% affected by external species substitution with non-hake species, as the cause of mislabelling in processed and cooked hake-based products. The combination of both DNA keys minimizes the tool-associated rate of diagnostic failure, allowing decoupling of mislabelling categories and maximizing the quantitative adscription of products to species on any kind of hake-based products.

AB Unfertilized chicken eggs within 24 h of laying were chosen and stored at 25 degrees C and 45% humidity for 0, 20, and 40 days. The experimental group (EG) was the carbon dioxide-modified atmosphere packaging (CDMAP) group, whereas the control group (CG) contained eggs without special handling. Egg freshness indexes were measured. The proteome of the egg whites was determined by LC-MS/ MS using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ). A total of 87 proteins were detected. The results indicated that CDMAP can control the change in protein abundance. Using a correlation analysis between the protein abundance and freshness indexes of the EG, Beta-hexosaminidase, Trypsin inhibitor ClTI-1 and Apolipoprotein D were determined to be potential predictors of egg freshness. In comparing the proteomes of the EG and CG, it was concluded that CDMAP could affect the proteins related to egg vitelline membranes, eggshell matrix and metabolic intensity to maintain egg freshness.

AB The objectives of this study were to determine the long-term effects of agronomic application of olive mill wastewater (OMW) with rock phosphate (RP) in a field of olive trees, on olive fruits and oil quality. The results revealed that olive fruits of OMW-RP amended plants had higher contents of polyphenols and mannitol indicating that agronomic application of OMW with RP generated an oxidative stress. Land spreading of OMW with RP altered the relative proportions of individual sugars in leaves and fruits. Consequently, the oil content decreased significantly, and a marked decrease in the contents of carotenoids and chlorophylls was also observed. Changes also took place in the composition of fatty acids, particularly by the increase of linoleic acid and the decrease of oleic acid. Our results suggested that the use of OMW in combination with RP is expected to have a major negative impact on olive fruit and oil quality. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In an effort to increase the nutritional value of common gluten-free (GF) cereal-based foods, GF cookies using alfalfa seed flour (ASF), at different substitution levels to common rice flour (0% as control, 15%, 30% and 45% w/w), were produced. Crude protein, total dietary fibre, total polyunsaturated, total n-3 and n-6 fatty acid contents increased linearly (p < 0.05) by raising the substitution levels of rice with ASF. The hardness, the total phenolic content, the in vitro antioxidant capacity and the resistant starch increased linearly (p < 0.05), whereas the starch hydrolysis index decreased linearly (p < 0.05) by raising the substitution levels of rice flour with ASF. Despite the fact that ASF-substituted GF cookies had inferior sensory attributes compared to the control, the score given by the panellists remained at fairly good levels for all tested parameters, showing acceptability of the substituted GF cookies.

AB Dextrinization of starch using extrusion processing is crucial to the quality of direct expanded products. To determine the extent of dextrinization, flour samples were extracted from a twin-screw extruder that had been brought to a sudden stop and molecular weights were determined by intrinsic viscosity. The screw profile and moisture feed content had the most significant impact on molecular weight reduction, reducing intrinsic viscosity from 1.75 to 0.70 dL/g at the most. The breakdown, as shown by a reduction in intrinsic viscosity, had a strong negative correlation (r = -0.96) with specific mechanical energy. However, the extruder die did not have a measurable impact on the molecular weight reduction of waxy flour. Size exclusion chromatography confirmed intrinsic viscosity measurements were associated with reduction of the size of amylopectin molecules to approximately 1/10 the original molecular weight while native gliadin was nearly eliminated from the waxy flour following the extrusion treatments.

AB The effect of supercritical carbon dioxide technology (SCCD, 14, 16, and 18 MPa at 35 +/- 2 degrees C for 10 min) on whey-grape juice drink characteristics was investigated. Physicochemical characterization (pH, titratable acidity, total soluble solids), bioactive compounds (phenolic compounds, anthocyanin, DPPH and ACE activity) and the volatile compounds were performed. Absence of differences were found among treatments for pH, titratable acidity, soluble solids, total anthocyanin and DPPH activity (p-value > 0.05). A direct relationship between SCCD pressure and ACE inhibitory activity was observed, with 34.63, 38.75, and 44.31% (14, 16, and 18 MPa, respectively). Regards the volatile compounds, it was noted few differences except by the presence of ketones. The findings confirm the SCCD processing as a potential promising technology to the conventional thermal treatment. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Flavor release from food matrices depends on the partition of volatile flavor compounds between the food matrix and the vapor phase. Thus, we herein investigated the relationship between released flavor concentrations and three different partition coefficients, namely octanol-water, octanol-air, and water-air, which represented the oil, water, and air phases present in emulsions. Limonene, 2-methylpyrazine, nonanal, benzaldehyde, ethyl benzoate, a-terpineol, benzyl alcohol, and octanoic acid were employed. The released concentrations of these flavor compounds from oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions were measured under equilibrium using static headspace gas chromatography. The results indicated that water-air and octanol-air partition coefficients correlated with the logarithms of the released concentrations in the headspace for highly lipophilic flavor compounds. Moreover, the same tendency was observed over various oil volume ratios in the emulsions. Our findings therefore suggest that octanol-air and waterair partition coefficients can be used to predict the released concentration of lipophilic flavor compounds from O/W emulsions.

AB 2,3,5,6-Tetramethylpyrazine (TMP) is an important health functional composition in vinegars, but there are controversial viewpoints about its formation mechanism and scarce relevant records on TMP content enhancement in vinegar products. In this study, a simple and accurate solvent extraction coupled with GC-FID method was developed for the simultaneous determination of TMP and acetoin in vinegars and 137 worldwide samples were analyzed. Meanwhile, the ammonium contents of all the vinegar samples were determined using the salicylate method. By nonlinear surface fitting, the concentrations of TMP in vinegars were found to follow second-order polynomial models of acetoin and ammonium concentrations. By isotopic tracing using C-13 labelled acetoin and N-15 ammonium, acetoin and ammonium were deduced to be the precursors of TMP in vinegars. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Dextran or xanthan were used as model exocellular polysaccharides (EPS) to compare the extraction efficiency of EPS from skim milk acid gels using three different protocols. Extraction yields, residual protein concentrations and the macromolecular properties of extracted EPS were determined. For both model EPS, the highest extraction yield (similar to 80%) was obtained when samples were heated in acidic conditions at the first step of extraction (Protocol 1). Protocols that contained steps of acid/ethanol precipitation without heating (Protocols 2 and 3) show lower extraction yields (similar to 55%) but allow a better preservation of the EPS macromolecular properties. Changing the pH of acid gels up to 7 before extraction (Protocol 3) improved the extraction yield of anionic EPS without effect on the macromolecular properties of EPS. Protocol 1 was then applied for the quantification of EPS produced during the yogurt fermentation, while Protocol 3 was dedicated to their macromolecular characterization. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Magnesium may reduce carotenoid bioavailability by forming insoluble complexes with bile salts/fatty acids, inhibiting micelle formation. Here, we investigated whether altering bile/pancreatin concentration influenced potential negative effects of magnesium on carotenoid bioaccessibility. Spinach (4 g) was digested in vitro with added magnesium (0, 200, 400 mg/L) and canola oil/coffee creamer, at varying bile extract (1 or 8 mM) and pancreatin (100 or 990 mg/L) concentrations. Bioaccessibility was determined for beta-carotene, lutein, and total carotenoids via HPLC. Additionally, lipolysis, particle size, and zeta potential of the micellar fractions were investigated. Increasing magnesium concentrations negatively affected carotenoid bioaccessibility (p < 0.001), lipolysis, particle size and zeta potential. The impact of magnesium on carotenoid bioaccessibility was modulated mainly by bile concentration, with samples digested with 1 mM of bile being more susceptible to inhibitory effects of magnesium than those digested with 8 mM (p < 0.001). Thus, magnesium was found to potentially interfere with carotenoid bioaccessibility at various physiologically plausible conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Increasing demand for organic products and their premium prices make them an attractive target for fraudulent malpractices. In this study, a large-scale comparative metabolomics approach was applied to investigate the effect of the agronomic production system on the metabolite composition of carrots and to build statistical models for prediction purposes. Orthogonal projections to latent structures-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) was applied successfully to predict the origin of the agricultural system of the harvested carrots on the basis of features determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. When the training set used to build the OPLS-DA models contained samples representative of each harvest year, the models were able to classify unknown samples correctly (100% correct classification). If a harvest year was left out of the training sets and used for predictions, the correct classification rates achieved ranged from 76% to 100%. The results therefore highlight the potential of metabolomic fingerprinting for organic food authentication purposes. (C) 2017 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Stabilising phycocyanin by anionic micelles
SO FOOD CHEMISTRY
LA English
DT Article
DE Phycocyanin; Anionic micelles; Natural food colour; SDS
AB Phycocyanins are pigment-protein complexes with potential application as natural food colourants. The perceived colour of phycocyanins varies with pH, and a method to stabilise the colour over a broad range of pH values is requested by the food industry. In this work, the stabilising effect of sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) micelles on pH-induced colour variations of phycocyanin was examined. SDS was shown to stabilise the blue conformation of phycocyanin, preventing formation of the green conformation, which is prevalent at low pH. The studies indicated that the stabilising effect occurred through interaction or entrapment of the non-protonated, circular helical (blue) structure of phycocyanin and the anionic SDS micelles. The interaction prevented conversion into protonated, partially unfolded (green) phycocyanin species. This information opens for new possibilities to stabilise the blue conformation of phycocyanin and to apply the stabilised form in food products as a natural blue food colourant.

AB Changes in polycyclic (PAH) and oxygenated (OPAH) aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations in vegetable oils during storage for 270 days at 25 degrees C or 4 degrees C were investigated. The concentrations of OPAHs and PAHs increased with storage time. The increase in PAH concentration was mainly caused by light PAHs. Total PAH concentrations increased from 33.11-36.77 mu g/kg to 45.12-58.04 mu g/kg in 26 crude oil samples, while those in 26 refined oil samples increased from 16.52-20.02 mu g/kg to 25.73-40.01 mu g/kg. Acid value (AV) and peroxide value (POV) also showed an increase during the storage process from 0.08-0.92 mg/kg to 0.33-2.98 mg/kg, and from 0.08-0.12 mmol/kg to 0.33-3.45 mmol/kg in 52 tested oils, respectively. AV and POV were within the regulatory limits of China after storage for 270 days. However, concentrations of 16 PAHs in all tested oils exceeded 25 mu g/kg. The results indicated PAHs and OPAHs formation was better inhibited in oils stored at lower temperature. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This IL modified extraction fiber is capable of extracting target analytes directly from complicated tea water matrices with the addition of surfactant. A series of extraction conditions were investigated by one-factor-at-a-time approach and orthogonal test. After a series experiments, the optimum conditions were found to be 10% [HIMIM]NTf2 as coating solution, 2 min vortex time, 500 mu L acetonitrile as dispersive solvent and 2 min desorption time. Under the above conditions, the proposed technique was applied to detect fungicides from real tea water samples with satisfactory results. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Two fresh (fresh cubic pieces, fresh puree) and two dried (dried cubic pieces, dried powder) products were prepared from a homogenous mango fruit batch to obtain four samples differing in texture. The aromatic profiles were determined by SAFE extraction technique and GC-MS analysis. VOCs released during consumption were trapped by a retronasal aroma-trapping device (RATD) and analysed by GC-MS. Twenty-one terpenes and one ester were identified from the exhaled nose-space. They were amongst the major mango volatile compounds, 10 of which were already reported as being potential key flavour compounds in mango. The in vivo release of aroma compounds was affected by the matrix texture. The intact samples (fresh and dried cubic pieces) released significantly more aroma compounds than disintegrated samples (fresh puree, dried powder). The sensory descriptive analysis findings were in close agreement with the in vivo aroma release data regarding fresh products, in contrast to the dried products. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Quality of saffron, a valuable food additive, could considerably affect the consumers' health. In this work, a novel preprocessing strategy for image analysis of saffron thin layer chromatographic (TLC) patterns was introduced. This includes performing a series of image pre-processing techniques on TLC images such as compression, inversion, elimination of general baseline (using asymmetric least squares (AsLS)), removing spots shift and concavity (by correlation optimization warping (COW)), and finally conversion to RGB chromatograms. Subsequently, an unsupervised multivariate data analysis including principal component analysis (PCA) and k-means clustering was utilized to investigate the soil salinity effect, as a cultivation parameter, on saffron TLC patterns. This method was used as a rapid and simple technique to obtain the chemical fingerprints of saffron TLC images. Finally, the separated TLC spots were chemically identified using high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection (HPLC-DAD). Accordingly, the saffron quality from different areas of Iran was evaluated and classified. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To investigate the effects of seasonal variations and processing on cow milk fat, raw milk collected in six individual months and corresponding ultra high temperature (UHT) milk were analyzed. Similar seasonal variations in lipid classes and fatty acid composition were found in raw and UHT milk.
   Under commercial processing, lipid content was standardized to approximately 1.5% in UHT milk. Decreased diameter of fat droplets (around 1 mu m) and thinner globule membranes were observed, as revealed using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). The distribution of lipid classes was modified with a decreased proportion of triacylglycerol accompanied by the increase of phospholipids and free fatty acids. Saturated fatty acids C12:0 and C14:0, trans-fatty acids including conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), polyunsaturated fatty acids C18:2(n-6) and C18:3(n-3), showed increased proportions in UHT milk. These results provide an indication of the effect of UHT processing on milk lipid properties. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID LEAST-SQUARES REGRESSION
AB Near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy was evaluated as a rapid method for the determination of oleic, palmitic, linoleic and linolenic acids as well as omega-3, omega-6, and to predict polyunsaturated, monounsaturated and saturated fatty acids, together with triacylglycerides, diglycerides, free fatty acids and ergosterol in salmon oil. To do it, Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression models were applied to correlate NIR spectra with aforementioned fatty acids and lipid classes. Results obtained were validated in front of reference procedures based on high performance thin layer and gas chromatography. PLS-NIR has a good predictive capability with relative root mean square error of prediction (RRMSEP) values below or equal to 1.8% and provides rapid analysis without the use of any chemicals making it an environmentally friendly methodology.

AB The present work describes the encapsulation of probiotics using a by-product as wall material and a process feasible to be scaled-up: coacervation of soybean protein concentrate (SPC) by using calcium salts and spray-drying. SPC was extracted from soybean flour, produced during the processing of soybean milk, by alkaline extraction following isoelectric precipitation. Two probiotic strains were selected for encapsulation (Lactobacillus plantarum CECT 220 and Lactobacillus casei CECT 475) in order to evaluate the ability of SPC to encapsulate and protect bacteria from stress conditions. The viability of these encapsulated strains under in vitro gastrointestinal conditions and shelf-life during storage were compared with the most common forms commercialized nowadays. Results show that SPC is a feasible material for the development of probiotic microparticles with adequate physicochemical properties and enhanced significantly both probiotic viability and tolerance against simulated gastrointestinal fluids when compared to current available commercial forms.

AB This paper investigates the use of synchronous fluorescence, UV-Vis and near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy coupled with chemometric methods to discriminate samples of high-quality plum brandies (Slivovica) of different varietal origins (Prunus domestica L.). Synchronous fluorescence spectra (SFS) for wavelength differences in the range of 70-100 nm, NIR spectra in the wavenumber range of 4000-7500 cm (1) and UV-Vis spectra in the wavelength interval of 220-320 nm were compared. The best discrimination models were created by linear discriminant analysis based on principal component analysis applied to SFS recorded with wavelength difference either 80 nm or 100 nm, allowing the classification of plum brandy according to harvest time as early (summer) and late (autumn) plum varieties; the total correct classifications were 96% and 100% for the calibration and prediction steps, respectively.

AB A novel time-lapse synchrotron deep-UV microscopy methodology was developed that made use of the natural tryptophan fluorescence of proteins. It enabled the monitoring in situ of the microstructural changes of protein gels during simulated gastric digestion. Two dairy gels with an identical composition, but differing by the coagulation mode, were submitted to static in vitro gastric digestion. The kinetics of gel particle breakdown were quantified by image analysis and physico-chemical analyses of digesta. The results confirm the tendency of rennet gels, but not acid gels, to form compact protein aggregates under acidic conditions of the stomach. Consequently, the kinetics of proteolysis were much slower for the rennet gel, confirming the hypothesis of a reduced pepsin accessibility to its substrate. The particle shapes remained unchanged and the disintegration kinetics followed an exponential trend, suggesting that erosion was the predominant mechanism of the enzymatic breakdown of dairy gels in these experimental conditions.

AB Stable isotope ratios (C-13/C-12 and N-15/N-14) of South African lambs from different regions were measured by isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS). Homogenised and defatted meat of the Longissimus lumborum muscle was assessed. The Ruens and Hantam Karoo regions had the lowest (P <= 0.05) delta C-13 values related to the presence of C-3 plants (lucerne and Karoo bushes, respectively). The Northern Karoo, Namibia and Bushmanland had the highest delta C-13 values likely due to a high proportion of dietary C-4 grass species. The delta N-15 values were highest for Central Karoo, Semi-extensive, Namibia and Hantam Karoo, while Ruens and Feedlot had the lowest nitrogen isotope values (P <= 0.05). Classification of origin (Karoo vs. Non-Karoo) using discriminant analysis allowed 95% and 90% correct classification of the samples for the estimation model and validation models, respectively. The results confirm that IRMS provides sufficient discriminative power to classify lamb meat of varying origin. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB An investigation on the proteome of the sweet kernel of apricot, based on equalisation with combinatorial peptide ligand libraries (CPLLs), SDS-PAGE, nLC-ESI-MS/MS, and database search, permitted identifying 175 proteins. Gene ontology analysis indicated that their main molecular functions are in nucleotide binding (20.9%), hydrolase activities (10.6%), kinase activities (7%), and catalytic activity (5.6%). A proteinprotein association network analysis using STRING software permitted to build an interactomic map of all detected proteins, characterised by 34 interactions. In order to forecast the potential health benefits deriving from the consumption of these proteins, the two most abundant, i.e. Prunin 1 and 2, were enzymatically digested in silico predicting 10 and 14 peptides, respectively. Searching their sequences in the database BIOPEP, it was possible to suggest a variety of bioactivities, including dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) and angiotensin converting enzyme I (ACE) inhibition, glucose uptake stimulation and antioxidant properties.

AB The inhibition properties of a number of antioxidants against peroxidation, started by a 2,2'-azobis[2-(2-imidazolin-2-yl) propane] radical initiator, of linoleic acid in sodium dodecyl sulfate micelles, have been determined in terms of oxygen consumption by a Clark electrode in an oxygen-tight cell. For the 31 antioxidants investigated at variable concentrations, the experimental results well fit the kinetic equation for competitive reactions.
   The ratio between the initial rates, monitored in the absence and in the presence of antioxidants, depends linearly on their concentration. From the slopes of these straight lines, an absolute scale of inhibition properties of the lipid peroxidation can be devised. Furthermore, the little difference of the time of complete oxygen consumption on concentration of different antioxidants has been found, indicating a restricted difference towards chemical structure and stoichiometric ratio.
   Some considerations regarding the mechanisms of inhibition of the lipid peroxidation in micelles, in view of bibliographic data, have been made. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The physicochemical properties of gliadin upon mild thermal treatment were studied in terms of polymerization behavior, conformation and viscoelasticity. Gliadin samples were heated at 40, 60 and 90 degrees C for up to 20 min. Results showed that alpha-gliadin started to polymerize via disulfide (SS) bonds before gamma-gliadin at 90 degrees C, resulting in the extractability loss in aqueous ethanol. beta-Turn and specific beta-sheet structures were partially conversed to alpha-helices during thermal treatment. Rearrangement of noncovalent forces might contribute to viscosity loss of gliadin at 40 and 60 degrees C. However, the elevated elasticity at 90 degrees C was mainly due to gliadin polymerization while the viscosity variation was resulted from combined effects of non-covalent forces and covalent SS bonds. This study could offer insight into the variation of gliadin characteristics during the early baking process. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Studies on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) formation have focused on dynamic studies or research on cooking conditions of meat. This research aimed to elucidate the influence of heating conditions, existence of water, lipid precursors and antioxidants on the formation and inhibition of PAHs in meat model systems by using GC/MS analysis, while mechanisms were evaluated by electron spin resonance (ESR) studies. PAHs formation was more affected by change in temperature than of time. Also, existence of water and antioxidants was an important factor affecting the inhibition of PAHs. In all heated meat model systems the addition of lipid precursors led to significantly increased PAHs (p < 0.05). (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Color is an important characteristic determining the fruit value. Although ripe bananas usually have yellow peels, several banana cultivars have red peels. As details of the pigments in banana fruits are unknown, we investigated these pigments contents and compositions in the peel and pulp of red cultivar 'Hongjiaowang' and yellow cultivar 'Baxijiao' by UPLC-PDA-QTOF-MS and HPLC-PDA techniques. The 'Hongjiaowang' peel color was mainly determined by the presence of anthocyanin-containing epidermal cells. Rutinoside derivatives of cyanidin, peonidin, petunidin, and malvidin were unique to the red peel, and possibly responsible for the red color. 'Hongjiaowang' contained higher total content of carotenoids than 'Baxijiao' in both pulp and peel. Lutein, alpha-carotene, and beta-carotene were main carotenoids, which might play a more important role than flavonoids in producing the yellow banana color owing to the properties and distribution in the fruit. The information will help us understand a complete profile of pigments in banana. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Magnetically N-doped Carbon quantum dots has been synthesized via a simple chemical method and applied as a sorbent for the preconcentration and extraction of trace amounts of Pb2+ from water and vegetable samples followed by flame atomic absorption spectrometric detection. The nanoparticles were characterized by X-ray diffraction, UV-vis spectra, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, vibrating sample magnetometer analysis and transmission electron microscopy. A central-composite design was used to find the optimum conditions for the preconcentration procedure through response surface methodology. The effects of various parameters such as the pH value, adsorption time, amount of adsorbent, desorption conditions (type, concentration and volume of the eluent and desorption time), sample volume and interfering ions have been studied. Under the optimized conditions, the calibration graph was linear in the range of 0.3-300 mu g L-1 (R-2 = 9992). The detection limit and pre-concentration factor were found to be 0.082 mu g L-1 and 265, respectively. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A 9-week study was conducted to compare dietary corn starch (CS) or tapioca starch (TS), with or without being pre-gelatinized (PG), on the growth, feeding efficiencies, plasma and muscle biochemistry, intestinal short chain fatty acids (SCFA), and liver glycogen of triplicate groups of 20 red hybrid tilapia (Orecohromis sp.). Various pellet characteristics were evaluated, along with their surface and cross sectional microstructure. The PG diets had significantly higher water stability, bulk density, and protein solubility, along with a smoother surface. Tilapia fed the TS diet had lower growth than had all other tilapia, but were significantly improved when diet was pre-gelatinized. In the PG treatments, intestinal SCFA significantly decreased while plasma glucose, cholesterol and triglycerides, as well as liver glycogen, significantly increased. Fish fed the CS diet had significantly more long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid than had those fed by other treatments. Pre-gelatinization may improve fish productivity and offer greater flexibility during aquafeed production. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A series of pomegranate jams were prepared from a Tunisian ecotype (Tounsi) with different amounts of sugar (10, 20 and 30%) and low-methoxylated pectin (0.2, 0.7 and 1.2%). The most appreciated formulation was that contaning 30% sugars and 0.2% pectin. Then, commercial pectin was substituted by other gelling agents (pomegranate peel powders dried at 50 degrees C vs lyophilized, pectin and fibre extracted from pomegranate peel) for the preparation of pomegranate peel-based jams. The elaborated jams were evaluated for physichochemical, colour, texture and sensory characteristics. Results revealed that the jam (JPP2) elaborated with 0.2% pectin extracted from pomegranate peel exhibited similar overall acceptability to that prepared with commercial pectin. However, it was more acceptable than other pomegranate peel-based jams, which was related to a better appreciation of sweetness and colour. According to the colour and texture measurements, this sample (JPP2) was more reddish and less firm than other samples. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Hyperspectral imaging technology was used to investigate the effect of various peel colors on soluble solids content (SSC) prediction model and build a SSC model insensitive to the color distribution of apple peel. The SSC and peel pigments were measured, effective wavelengths (EWs) of SSC and pigments were selected from the acquired hyperspectral images of the intact and peeled apple samples, respectively. The effect of pigments on the SSC prediction was studied and optimal SSC EWs were selected from the peel-flesh layers spectra after removing the chlorophyll and anthocyanin EWs. Then, the optimal bi-layer model for SSC prediction was built based on the finally selected optimal SSC EWs. Results showed that the correlation coefficient of prediction, root mean square error of prediction and selected bands of the bi-layer model were 0.9560, 0.2528 and 41, respectively, which will be more acceptable for future online SSC prediction of various colors of apple.

AB A simple, green and effective extraction method, namely, pyridinium ionic liquid-(IL) based liquid-solid extraction (LSE), was first designed to extract the main inorganic and organic iodine compounds (I, monoiodo-tyrosine (MIT) and diiodo-tyrosine (DIT)). The optimal extraction conditions were as follows: ultrasonic intensity 100 W, IL ([EPy]Br) concentration 200 mM, extraction time 30 min, liquid/solid ratio 10 mL/g, and pH value 6.5. The morphologies of Laminaria were studied by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The recovery values of I, MIT and DIT from Laminaria were in the range of 88% to 94%, and limits of detection were in the range of 59.40 to 283.6 ng/g. The proposed method was applied to the extraction and determination of iodine compounds in three Laminaria. The results showed that IL-based LSE could be a promising method for rapid extraction of bioactive iodine from complex food matrices. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In the present study reverse-phase UHPLC-PDA technique was developed at 60 degrees C for simultaneous quantification of allyl, 3-butenyl, 4-(methylthio)butyl, benzyl and phenethyl isothiocyanates. The validation parameter showed a very good linearity, with a correlation coefficient of 1.00 for all detected standard analytes. Also, high precision and accuracy were observed with lowest obtained values of 1.39% and 99.1%, respectively. Different varieties of three plants, viz. Brassica rapa var. rapa L., Raphanus sativus L. var. oleiformis Pers. and Eruca sativa Mill., were analyzed with this method. After analysis, 4-(methylthio) butyl isothiocyanate was observed to be the major component in the varieties of arugula. Allyl, benzyl and phenethyl isothiocyanates were detected in turnip varieties and, in addition, 3-butenyl isothiocyanate was detected in radish varieties. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Phycocyanobilin (PCB) is a blue tetrapyrrole chromophore of C-phycocyanin, the main protein of the microalga Spirulina, with numerous proven health-related benefits. We examined binding of PCB to bovine serum albumin (BSA) and how it affects protein and ligand stability. Protein fluorescence quenching and microscale thermophoresis demonstrated high-affinity binding (K-a = 2 x 10(6) M-1). Spectroscopic titration with molecular docking analysis revealed two binding sites on BSA, at the inter-domain cleft and at subdomain IB, while CD spectroscopy indicated stereo-selective binding of the P conformer of the pigment to the protein. The PCB protein complex showed increased thermal stability. Although complex formation partly masked the antioxidant properties of PCB and BSA, a mutually protective effect against free radical-induced oxidation was found. BSA could be suitable for delivery of PCB as a food colorant or bioactive component. Our results also highlight subtle differences between PCB binding to bovine vs. human serum albumin.

AB Adzuki bean seed coats contain a variety of pigments with potential bioactivity, including polyphenols, such as proanthocyanidin. To clarify the structure of the pigments from adzuki bean seed coats, the MeOH extract of the seed coats and the extraction residue were subjected to various instrumental analyses and degradation by thiolysis. The MeOH extract was found to contain two types of polymeric red pigments. One of these pigments was assumed to be a simple proanthocyanidin, whereas the other was a complicated polyphenol produced by several modifications and conversions. Direct thiolysis of adzuki seed coat yielded three products as extension subunits. From their chemical structures, a glyoxylic acid-bridged catechin skeleton was suggested as a partial structure of adzuki pigments. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Lipid oxidation-a major cause of food product deterioration-necessitates the use of food additives to inhibit food oxidation. Ginger extract (GE) has been reported to possess antioxidant properties. However, components isolated from ginger have been rarely reported to inhibit fat oxidation. Herein, antioxidant properties of GE and four pure components derived from it (6-gingerol, 8-gingerol, 10-gingerol, and 6-shogaol) were examined and their properties were compared to those of butylated hydroxytoluene. GE and the constituent components exhibited antioxidant properties that might be attributed to their hydroxyl groups and suitable solubilizing side chains. 6-Shogaol and 10-gingerol exhibited higher activity at 60 degrees C than 6-gingerol and 8-gingerol. Low antioxidant activity was detected at high temperatures (120/180 degrees C). Overall, GE displayed the strongest dose-dependent antioxidant properties, especially at high temperatures, thereby demonstrating that GE can be employed as a natural antioxidant in lipid-containing processed foods.

DE Oxidation of proanthocyanidin; Red rice; Color-deepening effect
ID RICE; PROCYANIDINS; CONDENSATION
AB To elucidate the mechanism of the color-deepening phenomenon in aged red rice samples, a partial structure of proanthocyanidin, (+)-catechin-(4 -> 8)-dimer (1), was synthesized as a model compound and subjected to chemical oxidation. HPLC analysis of oxidized 1 revealed new peaks which were isolated; among these, four compounds (2-5) having formed intramolecular bonds between the D and B rings were determined. These compounds and their derivatives in red rice extracts were identified by multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry. The UV-Vis spectra of 1-5 were recorded to clarify the correlation between the color-deepening effect and their chemical structures. Hence, the spectral absorption maxima between 300 and 500 nm, corresponding to the oxidation products, increase. Therefore, the color-deepening phenomenon of red rice is thought to proceed via the formation of intramolecular bonds in proanthocyanidin by oxidation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The effect of 0.1-0.5% (w/w) sodium-alginate (SA) with three molecular-weights (2660, 3890 and 4640 kDa) on the water-holding capacity (WHC) of chicken-breast myosin gels was investigated. The results showed that 0.1-0.5% SA of three molecular-weights increased the WHC of myosin-SA gels, and the heavier SA induced a higher WHC. Electrostatic-interactions and hydrogen-bonding contributed to the intermolecular aggregation in the myosin-SA system and enhanced its intermolecular interactions by overcoming the steric hindrance effect of SA with heavier molecules. This aggregation induced the increased turbidity, transition temperature and the decreased surface hydrophobicity of myosin-SA solutions and the formation of an inhomogeneous network with large cavities for entrapping water. The combined effects of stronger intermolecular interactions and the network induced a higher WHC of the gel with heavier SA. It is interesting to understand the gelling mechanism for the protein-polysaccharide system and to efficiently select SA for developing low-fat meat products in industry. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The potentially probiotic strains were added to the mixture in the DVS process and applied for the production of ice cream which were then analyzed physicochemically and microbiologically. Results showed that addition of bacteria enriched with magnesium did not change chemical parameters of the ice cream and did not affect the freezing process, meltability, and hardness. No significant differences were noted in colour of the samples. The ice cream with addition of bacteria enriched with magnesium had higher adhesiveness. The results of viability determination showed that the total number of microorganisms in the ice cream was higher than in the starter cultures.

AB A rapid, simple, and reliable HPLC method was developed and validated to determine the presence of ferrocyanide ions (FeCNs) in food grade salts. An analytical column coupled with a guard column and mobile phase comprised of sodium perchlorate and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) were employed at a detection wavelength of 221 nm. Samples were dissolved in 0.02 M NaOH solution and filtered. For processed salts including herbs and spices, a C-18 cartridge was applied to minimize interference from salt matrices. The method validation was based on linearity, accuracy (recovery), precision, LOD, LOQ, and measurement uncertainty. This method exhibits good linearity from 0.1-10 mg/L (r(2) = 0.9999). The LOD and LOQ values were determined to be 0.02 and 0.07 mg/kg, respectively. The FeCN recoveries in six salt matrices ranged from 80.3-102.2% (RSD = 0.3-4.4%). These results indicate that the proposed method is suitable for FeCN ion determination in various food grade salts. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A sensitive quantitative screening of coumarin in 43 commercially available cinnamons and cinnamon-containing foods was developed via HPTLC. Complex samples like cinnamon, tea, breakfast cereals, milk rice, jam, cinnamon stars and buns were extracted with methanol only. Separation was performed on silica gel with a mixture of n-hexane, ethyl acetate and ammonia. The specific detection via derivatization with an ethanolic potassium hydroxide solution resulted in fluorescent coumarin zones, measured at 365/>400 nm after stabilization. Limits of detection and quantification were 200 and 400 pg/band, respectively. Over all different sample types, the contents ranged from 0.3 to 5129 mg/kg with a mean repeatability and mean intermediate precision of 4% each. HPTLC-MS of selected zones, eluted via the TLC-MS Interface into MS, confirmed the identity of coumarin. Effect-directed detection as bioanalytical tool for risk assessment showed coumarin to be active against Aliivibrio fischeri bacteria down to 100 ng/band. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Bovine serum albumin (BSA)-dextran conjugate was prepared with glycation. Self-assembly nanoparticles were synthesized with a green, and facile approach. The effects of dry-heating time on the fabrication and characteristics of BSA-dextran conjugate nanoparticles were examined. Stable nanoparticles (<200 nm) were formed after only 6 h dry-heating because enough dextran was grafted onto the BSA to provide significant steric hindrance. Particle size decreased with the increase of dry-heating time and the lowest particle size (51.2 nm) was obtained after 24 h dry-heating. The nanoparticles were stable in a wide pH range (pH 2.0-7.0). The particle size of nanoparticles increased to 115 nm after curcumin incorporation and was stable even after one-month storage. TEM results demonstrated that curcumin-loaded nanoparticles displayed a spherical structure and were homogeneously dispersed. Curcumin in BSA-dextran nanoparticle showed better stability, compared to free curcumin. In addition, BSA-dextran nanoparticles can improve the cellular antioxidant activity of curcumin in Caco-2 cells. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Fresh blueberries were pretreated by pulsed electric fields (PEF) or thermal pretreatment and then were subject to osmotic dehydration. The changes in contents of anthocyanins, predominantly phenolic acids and flavonols, total phenolics, polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity and antioxidant activity in the blueberry samples during pretreatment and osmotic dehydration were investigated. Biochemical degradation and physical migration of these nutritive compounds from fruits to osmotic solutions were observed during the pretreatments and osmotic dehydration. PEF pretreated samples had the least degradation loss but the most migration loss of these compounds compared to thermally pretreated and control samples. Higher rates of water loss and solid gain during osmotic dehydration were also obtained by PEF pretreatment, reducing the dehydration time from 130 to 48 h. PEF pretreated and dehydrated fruits showed superior appearance to thermally pretreated and control samples. Therefore, PEF pretreatment is a preferred technology that balances nutritive quality, appearance, and dehydration rate. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB To address the effect of absence of NaCl on myosin heavy chain polymerization during two-step surimi gelation (different setting temperatures/times -5 degrees C/24 h and 30 degrees C/30 min-followed by heating at 90 degrees C/30 min) were considered. In gel samples made without salt (Lot A), no myosin heavy chain (MHC) polymerization was observed, only aggregation, as indicated by the electrophoresis in polyacrylamide/agarose gel profile. Moreover, these gels were characterized by weakly stabilized protein networks as denoted by the dynamic oscillatory measurement and FTIR analysis, resulting in poor quality gels. On the other hand, in gels made with added salt, MHC polymerization occurred, as evidenced by the electrophoresis, and the gelation resulted in a well-stabilized protein network with good physicochemical properties.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the content of biogenic amines (BAs) in different types of sufu samples obtained from different producers, and the effect of ethanol in reducing BA levels during sufu ripening. The results showed that different manufacturing processes altered the distribution of BAs in commercial sufu. Putrescine, cadaverine, histamine, and tryptamine were the main and common BAs in red, white and grey sufu. The contents of putrescine, cadaverine, tryptamine, beta-phenylethylamine and tyramine in the grey sufu of all producer brands were significantly (p < 0.05) higher than those in the white and red sufu. The addition of ethanol to the dressing mixture had a significant influence in reducing the total content of BAs in laboratory-made sufu. The slight increase in polypeptide and amino nitrogen contents after the addition of ethanol indicated a reduction in the degradation of water soluble protein. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

ID DIETARY FIBER; CAPACITY; FOOD
AB The antioxidant capacity of food influences its shelf life and human health. To determine this parameter, the corresponding antioxidant species must first be extracted. Current methods don't adequately address this issue since they rely on extractions with organic solvents or on in vitro digestion without a subsequent fermentation. We present an improved protocol to determine the global antioxidant response of foods (GAR+) including both in vitro digestion and fermentation. All samples should be fermented with the same fresh faecal inoculum in order to decrease variability. In addition, the use of a pool of faeces from healthy donors is strongly recommended to improve repeatability. Although most antioxidant capacity is achieved after digestion, in some foods fermentation plays a role. Thus, the GAR+ method provides reliable values of the antioxidant capacity of foods that are closer to their in vivo activity by including the effects of gut microbiota over non-digested nutrients.

AB Many methods have been developed to measure the antioxidant capacity of foods under non physiological-relevant conditions. In this study, three methods (TEAC(OH), GEAC(RED) and TEAC(AAPH)) are developed to measure antioxidant capacity at physiological pH, using indigo carmine as a redox dye. TEAC(OH) and TEAC(AAPH) determine foodstuffs' scavenging capacity against hydroxyl (OH center dot) and AAPH(center dot) radicals, while the third method measures the global reducing capacity of the sample. The results obtained for commercial teas, commercial beverages containing tea as the main ingredient and different solid foods (spinach, onion, salami, etc.) were compared with well-established protocols. The new methods demonstrated good linearity-reproducibility, providing reliable data about the antioxidant capacity of foods under physiological-resembling conditions. The new methods were also useful for evaluating the antioxidant capacity of human plasma after acute intake of tea. The physiological-resembling conditions of these assays and the use of absorbance readings make them suitable for application by any laboratory. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Measles and Rubella Global Strategic Plan 2012-2020 midterm review

AB Key Highlights: 1. Measles eradication is the ultimate goal but it is premature to set a date for its accomplishment. Existing regional elimination goals should be vigorously pursued to enable setting a global target by 2020.
   2. The basic strategic app soaches articulated in the Global Measles and Rubella Strategic Plan 2012-2020 are valid to achieve the goals but have not been fully implemented (or not appropriately adapted to local situations).
   3. The report recommends a shift from primary reliance on supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) to assure two doses of measles-containing vaccine (MCV) are delivered to the target population to primary reliance on ongoing services to assure administration of two doses of MCV. Regular high quality SIAs will still be necessary while ongoing services are being strengthened.
   4. The report recommends a shift from primary reliance on coverage to measure progress to incorporating disease incidence as a major indicator.
   5. The report recommends that the measles/rubella vaccination program be considered an indicator for the quality of the overall immunization program and that measles/rubella incidence and measles and rubella vaccination coverage be considered as primary indicators of immunization program performance.
   6. Polio transition presents both risks and opportunities: risks should be minimized and opportunities maximized.
   7. A school entry immunization check could contribute significantly to strengthening overall immunization services with assurance that recommended doses of measles and rubella vaccines as well as other vaccines have been delivered and providing those vaccines at that time if the child is un- or under vaccinated.
   8. Program decisions should increasingly be based on good quality data and appropriate analysis.
   9. The incorporation of rubella vaccination into the immunization program needs to be accelerated it should be accorded equivalent emphasis as measles.
   10. Outbreak investigation and response are critical but the most important thing is to prevent outbreaks. (C) 2017 World Health Organization; licensee Elsevier Ltd.

   report: Background and summary

ID ELIMINATION
AB Measles, a vaccine-preventable illness, is one of the most infectious diseases known to man. In 2015, an estimated 134,200 measles deaths occurred globally. Rubella, also vaccine-preventable, is a concern because infection during pregnancy can result in congenital defects in the baby. More than 100,000 babies with congenital rubella syndrome were estimated to have been born globally in 2010. Eradication of both measles and rubella is considered to be feasible, beneficial, and more cost-effective than high-level control. All six World Health Organization (WHO) regions have measles elimination goals by 2020 and two have rubella elimination goals by that year. However, the World Health Assembly has not endorsed a global eradication goal for either disease. In 2012, the Measles and Rubella Initiative published a Global Measles and Rubella Strategic Plan, 2012-2020, referred to hereafter as the Plan, which aimed to achieve measles and rubella elimination in at least five WHO regions by end-2020 through the implementation of five core strategies, with progress evaluated against 2015 milestones. When, by end-2015, none of these milestones had been met, WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) recommended a mid-term review of the Plan to evaluate progress toward goals, assess the quality of strategy implementation, and formulate lessons learned. A five-member team reviewed documents and conducted interviews with stakeholders as the basis for the review's conclusions and recommendations. This team concluded that, although significant progress in measles elimination had been made, progress had slowed. It recommended that countries continue to work toward elimination goals with a focus on strengthening ongoing immunization systems. In addition, it concluded that the strategies articulated in the Plan were sound, however full implementation had been impeded by inadequate country ownership and global political will, reflected in inadequate resources. Detailed recommendations for each of the Plan's five strategies as well as the areas of polio transition, governance and resource mobilization are outlined.

AB Mitochondrial diabetes (MD) is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by a chronic hyperglycemia and is maternally transmitted. Syndromic MD is a subgroup of MD including diabetic microangiopathy and macroangiopathy, in addition to extrapancreatic disorder. MD is caused by genetic mutations and deletions affecting mitochondrial DNA. This mitochondrial damage initiates apoptosis. In this study, we hypothesized that functional polymorphisms in genes involved in apoptotic pathway could be associated with the development of apoptosis in MD disease and increased its risk. Detection of apoptosis was confirmed on muscle biopsies taken from MD patients using the TUNEL method and the Cytochrome c protein expression level. We genotyped then 11 published SNPs from intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathway and assessed the signification of these polymorphisms in 43 MD patients and 100 healthy controls. We found 10 selected polymorphisms (p53 (rs1042522 and rs17878362), BCL2 (rs2279115), BAX (rs1805419), BAK1 (rs210132 and rs2227925), CASP3 (rs1405937), CASP7 (rs2227310), CASP8 (rs1045485) and CASPIO (rs13006529)) with a potential apoptosis effect in MD patients compared to control population. Specifically, SNPs involved in the intrinsic pathway (p53, BCL2, BAK1 and CASP3) presented the highest risk of apoptosis. Our result proved that apoptosis initiated by mtDNA mutations, can be emphasized by a functional apoptotic polymorphisms associated with high expression of cytochrome c protein and more myofibers with apoptosis in syndromic MD subgroup compared with non-syndromic MD subgroup.

AB Plant Xrn4 is a cytoplasmic 5' to 3' exoribonuclease that is reported to play an antiviral role during viral infection as demonstrated by experiments using the Xrn4s of Nicotiana benthamiana and Arabidopsis thaliana. Meanwhile, little is known about the anti-viral activity of Xrn4 from other plants. Here, we cloned the cytoplasmic Xrn4 gene of Oryza sativa (OsXrn4), and demonstrated that its over-expression elevated the 5'-3' exoribonuclease activity in rice plants and conferred resistance to rice stripe virus, a negative-sense RNA virus causing serious losses in East Asia. The accumulation of viral RNAs was also decreased. Moreover, the ectopic expression of OsXrn4 in N. benthamiana also conferred plant resistance to tobacco mosaic virus infection. These results show that the monocotyledonous plant cytoplasmic Xrn4 also has an antiviral role and thus provides a strategy for producing transgenic plants resistant to viral infection.

AB Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have played crucial roles in various cancers, including nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). In our study, we focused on the biological function and clinical significance of lncRNA LINC00460 in NPC. It was indicated that LINC00460 was markedly increased in NPC tissues and cells compared to their corresponding controls. Silencing LINC00460 was able to suppress NPC cell growth in vitro while overexpressing LINC00460 reversed this process. Moreover, in vivo tumor xenografts were established using CNE-1/SUNE-1 cells to detect the function of LINC00460 in NSCLC tumorigenesis. Rescue assay was performed to further confirm that LINC00460 contributed to the progression of NPC through regulating miR-149-5p/IL6 signal pathway. In conclusion, we have uncovered that LINC00460 could be regarded as a novel prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in NPC diagnosis and treatment.

AB Insulin-like peptides (ILPs) sense and transduce nutritional information and are linked to female reproduction in many insect species. Our previous studies have shown that "Target of rapamycin" (TOR) pathway functions through juvenile hormone (JH) to regulate amino acids-mediated vitellogenesis in the brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens, one of the most destructive rice pests in Asia. Recent reports have demonstrated that DNA methyltransferases (Dnmts) are also involved in female reproduction of N. lugens. However, the roles of ILPs and Dnmts in the nutritional regulation of female reproduction have not been fully elucidated. ILPs and Dnmts are highly expressed in the adult females after a supplement of amino acids, indicating nutrition -stimulated expression patterns of these genes. RNA interference-mediated depletion of NIILP2 or NIILP4 dramatically decreased the expression levels of N1Druntl and N1Dnmt2 (tRNA methyltransferase), and resulted in severely impaired ovary growth as well as the substantial reduction of fecundity. Notably, NIILP2 or NIIIP4 knockdown led to reduced mRNA accumulation of S6 kinase (S6K), a downstream target of the nutritional TOR pathway, and decreased vitellogenin content in the fat body. Silencing NlDnmtl or N1Dnmt2 effectively suppressed ovary development and decreased female fecundity. However, NlDnmtl or N1Dnmt2 knockdown did not influence the expression of NIILP2 and N1ILP4. We infer that amino acids act on ILPs and Dnmts to regulate vitellogenesis and oocyte maturation in N. lugens.

AB As a family of transcription factors, DNA binding with one figure (Dof) proteins play important roles in various biological processes in plants. Here, a total of 60 putative apple (Malus domestica) Dof genes (MdDof) were identified and mapped to different chromosomes. Chromosomal distribution and synteny analysis indicated that the expansion of the MdDof genes came primarily from segmental and duplication events, and from whole genome duplication, which lead to more Dof members in apples than in other plants. All 60 MdDof genes were classified into thirteen groups, according to multiple sequence alignment and the phylogenetic tree constructed of Dof genes from apple, peach (Prunus persica), Arabidopsis and rice. Within each group, the members shared a similar exon/intron and motif compositions, although the sizes of the MdDof genes and encoding proteins were quite different. Several Dof genes from the apple and peach were identified to be homologues based on their close synteny relationship, which suggested that these genes bear similar functions. Half of the MdDof genes were randomly selected to determine their responses to different stresses. The majority of MdDof genes were quite sensitive to PEG, NaCI, cold and exogenous ABA treatment. Our results suggested that MdDof family members may play important roles in plant tolerance to abiotic stress.

AB A novel transglutaminase (MsTGase) from Mythimna separata larvae was separated and purified; its biochemical property and enzymatic catalytic activities were investigated. MsTGase was obtained chromatographically by the precipitation of Sephadex G-100 gel and DEAE-Cellulose-52 ion-exchange column with 48-fold purification and a reproducible yield of approximately 12%. Molecular weight of the MsTGase was 63.5 KDa and its N-terminal amino acid sequence was GKIEEG-LVI. Michaelis constant of the MsTGase for the substrate N-CBZ-GlnGly was 12.83 mM with a V-max of 7.99 U/mL. Optimum conditions for MsTGase activity were at 42 degrees C and pH7.5. The enzyme didn't possess metal ion at its catalytic active site; its activity could be significantly inhibited by Mg2+, but activated by Ca2+. Chlorpyrifos and spinosad showed a strong potential to increase MsTGase activity, supporting the view that MsTGase was a novel target. Moreover, the formation of intermolecular crosslinks of casein and bovine serum albumin polymerized by MsTGase in the presence of DTT was observed. These findings pave the way for future studies on the physiological role of MsTGase and the potential impact of its regulation on MsTGase-associated pest management.

AB Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are produced in microbes as a source of carbon and energy storage. They are biodegradable and have properties similar to synthetic plastics, which make them an interesting alternative to petroleum-based plastics. In this study, a refined method of recovering PHA from Cupriavidus necator biomass was proposed by incorporating the use of the yellow mealworm (the larval phase of the mealworm beetle, Tenebrio molitor) as partial purification machinery, followed by washing of the fecal pellets with distilled water and sodium hydroxide. The PHA contents of the cells used in this study were 55 wt% (produced from palm olein) and 60 wt% (produced from waste animal fats). The treatment of distilled water and NaOH further increased the purity of PHA to 94%. In parallel, analysis of the 16S rRNA metagenomic sequencing of the mealworm gut microbiome has revealed remarkable changes in the bacterial diversity, especially between the mealworms fed with cells produced from palm olein and waste animal fats. This biological recovery of PHA from cells is an attempt to move towards a green and sustainable process with the aim of reducing the use of harmful solvents and strong chemicals during polymer purification. The results obtained show that - purities of > 90%, without a reduction in the molecular weight, can be obtained through this integrative biological recovery approach. In addition, this study has successfully shown that the cells, regardless of their origins, were readily consumed by the mealworms, and there is a correlation between the feed type and the mealworm gut microbiome.

AB This paper examines a new dextransucrase (DS) purification process of the extracellular enzyme (EC 2.4.1.5) produced by Leuconostoc mesenteroides IBUN 91.2.98. The enzyme was purified using a methodology which combines the immobilization of the enzyme in the produced biopolymer dextran, followed by a concentration step by ultrafiltration, using a membrane with a pore size of 300 kDa and subsequent hydrolysis of dextran by action of a dextranase and finally enzyme purification by anion exchange chromatography. The obtained enzyme has a purification factor of 118 and a yield of 26% from the initial extract. The purified dextransucrase has a specific activity of 335.1 U/mg, electrophoretic analysis shows absence of subunits, and a molecular weight of 170.1 kDa, a Vmax of 28.1 U/ml and a Km of 48 mM. Optimal conditions of pH, temperature and substrate concentration were 5, 30 degrees C and 584 mM sucrose respectively in a ratio of 0.4 U/mole of substrate. The produced dextran has a molecular size of 800-1000 kDa. Both the hydrolytic and transference activity are inhibited by Fe+3 (96.5%) and Al+3 (99.1%), whereas Mg+2 and K produce activation of 36.7% and 27.2%, respectively.

AB A Cre-lox based auto-excision strategy has been adapted for barley, capable of cre and selectable marker gene (SMG) removal. The cold inducible wheat promoter called wcs120 was utilised for driving Cre expression. The binary vector was carrying the transgene (uidA) and a so called 'recombination cassette' flanked by the lox sequences. This part included both the recombinase gene and the SMG (bar) under the control of a constitutive promoter. T-0, T-1 and T-2 transgenic plants were subjected to low temperature (at 4 degrees C, 10 degrees C and 12 degrees C) at different developmental stages to induce recombination. The presence of uidA, cre, and bar genes and recombination footprints were studied by PCR and DNA sequencing, while cre transcription was followed by qRT-PCR. These analyses indicated that, cold treatment of the germinating seeds (4 degrees C for 3 days) followed by plant growing at higher temperature (24 degrees C) has been the most efficient (90-100%), and this treatment lead to heritable changes in the genome. Thermal separation of Cre accumulation (at low temperature) from Cre enzyme activity (at higher temperature) could have prevented the premature excision of its own encoding gene, and lead to high expression level thereby increasing recombination frequency.

AB Waste paper, a major fraction of municipal solid waste, has a potential to serve as renewable feedstock for the biorefineries of fuels, chemicals and materials due to rich in cellulose and abundant at low cost. This study evaluates the possibility of waste office paper (WOP) to serve as a potential feedstock for the biorefinery production of poly (3-hydroxybutyrate). In this study, the WOP was pretreated, enzymatically saccharified and the hydrolysate was used for PHB production. The hydrolysate mainly consists of glucose (22.70 g/L) and xylose (1.78 g/L) and the corresponding sugar yield was about 816 mg/g. Ammonium sulphate and C/N ratio 20 were identified as most favorable for high yield of PHB. The batch fermentation of Cupriavidus necator using the pretreated WOP hydrolysate resulted in cell biomass, PHB production and PHB content of 7.74 g/L, 4.45 g/L and 57.52%, respectively. The volumetric productivity and yield achieved were 0.061 g/L/h and 0.210 g/g sugar, respectively. The results suggested that WOP could be a potential alternative feedstock for the biorefinery production of bioplastics.

AB In order to improve TriAcylGycerol (TAG) lipids accumulation in the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica on glucose, double over-expression of the major acyl-CoA: diacylglycerol acyltransferase encoding gene (ylDGA2) and of the glycerol-phosphate dehydrogenase encoding gene (ylGPD1) was carried out. The genes were over-expressed in a strain impaired for the mobilization of the accumulated lipids, through the deletion of the genes encoding acylcoenzyme A oxidases (POX1-6 genes) and the deletion of the very efficient lipase attached to the lipid bodies, encoded by ylTGL4. This metabolic engineering strategy had the objective of pulling the C-flow into the TAG synthesis by increasing the availability of glycerol-3-phosphate and its binding to fatty acids for the TAG synthesis.
   This strain showed a strong improvement in production performances on glucose in terms of lipid content (increase from 18 to 55%), lipid yield (increase from 0,035 to 0.14 g g(-1)) and by-product formation (decrease in citric acid yield from 0.68 to 0.4 g g(-1)).
   For developing bioprocess for the production of triacylglycerol from renewable carbon sources as glucose it is of first importance to control the C/N ratio in order to avoid citric acid excretion during lipid accumulation. Our engineered strain showed a delay in the onset of citric acid excretion as suggested by the 15% modulation of the critical C/N ratio.

AB This study evaluates a biorefinery concept for producing poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) with the cyanobacterial strain Synechocystis salina. Due to this reason, pigment extraction and cell disruption were investigated as pretreatment steps for the harvested cyanobacterial biomass. The results demonstrated that at least pigment removal was necessary to obtain PHB with processable quality (weight average molecular weight: 569-988 kg mol(-1), melting temperature: 177-182 degrees C), which was comparable to heterotrophically produced PHB. The removed pigments could be utilised as additional by-products (chlorophylls 0.27-1.98 mg g(-1) TS, carotenoids 0.21-1.51 mg g(-1) TS, phycocyanin 0-127 mg g(-1) TS), whose concentration depended on the used nutrient source. Since the residual biomass still contained proteins (242 mg g(-1) TS), carbohydrates (6.1 mg g(-1) TS) and lipids (14 mg g(-1) TS), it could be used as animal feed or converted to biomethane (348 m(n)(3) t(-1) VS) and fertiliser. The obtained results indicate that the combination of photoautotrophic PHB production with pigment extraction and utilisation of residual biomass offer the highest potential, since it contributes to decrease the environmental footprint of the process and because biomass could be used in a cascading way and the nutrient cycle could be closed.

AB In the present study different actinomycete strains were collected and isolated from Algerian Sahara soil with the aim to select novel enzymes with promising features for biotechnological applications. The Ms1 strain was selected, amongst the others, for its capability to produce melanin in different solid media. Ms1 chromosomal DNA was sequenced and the strain assigned to Streptomyces cyaneofuscatus sp. A tyrosinase (MW similar to 30 kD) encoding sequence was identified and the corresponding enzyme was isolated and biochemically characterized. The tyrosinase showed the highest activity and stability at neutral and alkaline pH and it was able to oxidize LDOPA at T = 55 degrees C and pH 7. The enzyme showed variable stability in presence of various water-miscible organic solvents, while it was inactivated by reducing agents. The tyrosinase activity was unaffected by NaCl and enhanced by different cations. Furthermore, the enzyme showed a higher specificity for diphenols than monophenols showing a higher diphenolase than monophenolase activity. Finally, tyrosinase was stabilized by immobilization on nylon nanofiber membranes with a payload of 82% when 1% glutaraldeyde was used. Taken all together, these results show that the enzyme displays interesting properties for biotechnological purposes.

AB High levels of recombinant protein production in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells can be achieved by amplification of transgenes using the dihydrofolate reductase/methotrexate (DHFR/MTX) system. With the aim to identify predictive markers enabling the preselection of suitable high producing clones we investigated the impact of MTX-based gene amplification on two CHO cells lines producing different levels of a human monoclonal antibody by carrying out a comparative proteome analysis. The difference in antibody yield between the high and low producer was 15-fold before and 245-fold after MTX selection. Difference in-gel electrophoresis of samples from before and after MTX selection revealed 17 unique proteins that were differentially expressed between the high and low productivity lines. Of these, five proteins were differently expressed before MTX selection, representing potential markers for productivity prior to selection and for engineering processes to generate novel CHO cell line with the desirable high productivity phenotype. Fifteen proteins were differently expressed between high and low producer after MTX selection. We further found that MTX selection induced more changes in the proteome of the low producer compared to the high producer.

TI Impact of the cultivation strategy on resveratrol production from

ID SACCHAROMYCES-CEREVISIAE; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; MICROORGANISMS; STRAIN
AB The health benefits of polyphenols such as stilbenes and flavonoids for humans are increasingly attracting attention. Resveratrol is a well-characterized naturally-occurring stilbene and potent anti-oxidant, which is used as food supplement and cosmetic ingredient. Several microorganisms including Corynebacterium glutamicum were engineered for resveratrol production from glucose. Based on the cultivation of a resveratrol-producing C. glutamicum strain in shake flasks, different strategies for improving production under controlled conditions at bioreactor scale were tested. To this end, different cultivation parameters including substrate concentration and operation modes (batch and fed-batch) were evaluated. Whereas the highest biomass concentration was observed during fed-batch fermentation, the maximum resveratrol production was achieved in batch mode. The maximal titer obtained was 12 mg L-1 of resveratrol without the addition of the fatty acid synthase inhibitor cerulenin, which was previously shown to be crucial for production with C. glutamicum. The specific growth rate during production seems to have a significant effect in resveratrol production and apparently low specific growth rates may redirect the metabolic bottleneck from p-coumaric acid formation to malonyl-CoA or ATP availability. We also show that high oxygen concentrations in the bioreactor negatively affected the obtained resveratrol titers with C. glutamicum, which is most likely due to the strong tendency of resveratrol to oxidize or oligomerize. Thus, up-scaling of the resveratrol production process is technically challenging and individual process parameters have to be optimized cautiously.

AB Yarrowia lipolytica is a suitable microbial platform to convert low-value hydrophobic substrates into microbial oils and other important metabolites. In this work, this yeast species was used to simultaneously synthetize ex novo lipids and produce citric acid and lipase from animal fat (pork lard) adding higher value to the low-cost fatty substrate. The effect of pH, lard concentration, arabic gum concentration and oxygen mass transfer rate (OTR) on lipids accumulation on Y. lipolytica batch cultures was assessed by an experimental design based on Taguchi method. OTR was by far the most influential parameter in the range of 96 mg L-1 h(-1)-480 mg L-1 h(-1).
   A bio-modification of initial lipidic substrate was observed and, depending on the nutritional and operational conditions, specialty lipids with specific composition and high added-value were obtained. The unsaturated-tosaturated fatty acids ratio of these microbial lipids is higher than in initial substrate, which indicates that they are more suitable than animal fat for food additives. Moreover, the simultaneous induction of lipase and citric acid by Y. lipolytica growing in animal fat demonstrates that a biorefinery approach may be designed based on animal fat raw material.

AB A new gene engineering technology has recently made it through the media, not only because of its technical advantages, but also because it is in the focus of an epic patent battle between two academic institutions.
   The technology bears the cryptic name "CRISPR Cas9", and allows the manipulation of genes (so called "gene editing") with so far unseen simplicity and efficacy. Dana Carroll of the University of Utah said for this reason that CRISPR Cas9 has brought about the "democratization of gene targeting".
   However, due to legal battles and conflicting patent estates, third parties may find it difficult to decide where to acquire licenses. This article gives an overview.

AB Every biopharmaceutical production process aims for control strategies to achieve process robustness in order to ensure consistent product quality. Process variability can origin from process parameters, the biological nature as well as from high lot-to-lot variability of raw materials. In filamentous processes raw materials with very complex matrices, such as corn steep liquor (CSL), are used, which are especially challenging to characterize.
   In this study, CSL was characterized in detail for its ingredients presenting an overall composition of its matrix of 50 analyzed components (19 amino acids, 5 organic acids, 8 reducing sugars, 7 water-soluble vitamins and 11 trace elements/minerals) in order to facilitate analytical reduction to fingerprinting methods FT-MIR was evaluated as fast and non-destructive spectroscopic fingerprinting method for adequate assessment of CSL quality. Feasibility of this method was shown by the correlation of certain bands in the spectra to substance groups present in CSL, such as the Amide I and II band and amino acids, respectively. Additionally, applicability of FT-MIR could be shown for classification of different CSL lots differing in provider and corn quality as well as for predictability of process performance attributes. The latter was demonstrated on a fed-batch filamentous fungi process for the production of antibiotics. By multivariate data analysis, it could be shown that CSL quality assessment via FT-MIR can be used for the prediction of maximal biomass generated in the process, with a correlation coefficient R-2 of 0.964, as well as for the prediction of an unwanted impurity. The combination of a fast and easy method for CSL quality assessment and correlations of this quality with process performance attributes may facilitate the establishment of a risk-based acceptance criteria for raw material quality release of CSL. As CSL is a frequent used raw material, we believe that this method will also be useful for other processes and that CSL quality assessment is of high relevance in academia and industry.

AB The C-terminal domains of proteases play crucial roles in hydrolysis, substrate adsorption and targeted binding. Identifying and characterizing interactions between C-terminal domains and biomacromolecules can help to examine the diversity as well as the substrate-binding ability of C-terminal domains and to explore novel functions. The bacterial pre-peptidase C-terminal (PPC) domain is a typical C-terminal domain normally found at the C-terminus of bacterial secreted proteases. In this work, we successfully demonstrated that 8-anilino-naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid (ANS) could be used to rapidly determine the interactions between this C-terminal domain and biomacromolecules. The time-resolved ANS fluorescence of PPC and collagen interaction could be used for quantitative analysis of the collagen-binding capability based on the slope of the time-scanning curve. Using this method, we found that PPC domains had an obvious affinity to fibrillar proteins but had little or no capacity to bind polysaccharides or linear DNAs. Docking studies proved that collagen bound to the same hydrophobic site of PPC as the ANS probe, causing a decrease in the emission intensity. This method is simple and cost effective and provides an effective detection technique to analyze the interaction between this C-terminal domain and biomolecules.

AB Plant carnivory results from the adaptation of plants to their environment. The capture and digestion of preys, followed by their assimilation by the plant is a source of additional nutrients to overcome scarce nutrient in poor soils. Nepenthes are highly studied carnivorous plants and have developed a number of ecological traits which have attracted the attention of plant biologists.
   Multiple adaptive strategies developed by these plants make them a source of inspiration for many applications ranging from therapeutic treatments to biocontrol solution in agriculture. The outstanding tissue organization of the digestive pitcher can help to create new and original materials usable in everyday life.
   In this review article, we propose a state of the art of the latest studies carried out on these particular plants and we establish a list of potential tracks for their exploitation.

AB Here we report the complete genome of the new species Streptomyces formicae KY5 isolated from Tetraponera fungus growing ants. S. formicae was sequenced using the PacBio and 454 platforms to generate a single linear chromosome with terminal inverted repeats. Illumina MiSeq sequencing was used to correct base changes resulting from the high error rate associated with PacBio. The genome is 9.6 Mbps, has a GC content of 71.38% and contains 8162 protein coding sequences. Predictive analysis shows this strain encodes at least 45 gene clusters for the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, including a type 2 polyketide synthase encoding cluster for the antibacterial formicamycins. Streptomyces formicae KY5 is a new, taxonomically distinct Streptomyces species and this complete genome sequence provides an important marker in the genus of Streptomyces.

AB Clostridium beijerinckii is a predominant solventogenic clostridia with great attraction for renewable liquid biofuel and biochemical production. Metabolic engineering and synthetic biology can be employed to engineer the strain toward desirable phenotypes. However, current limited information such as promoter strength and gene regulation may hinder the efficient engineering of the strain. To investigate genetic information and complex cellular bioprocesses of C. beijerinckii, an in vivo fluorescence reporter system can be employed. In general, green fluorescence protein (GFP) and relative analogs have been widely used as real-time reporters. However, GFP-family proteins require molecular oxygen for fluorescence maturation. Considering the strict anaerobic growth requirement of the clostridia, an oxygen-independent fluorescence reporter such as a flavin mononucleotide-based fluorescent protein (FbFP) can be used as an alternative fluorescence reporter. In this study, we synthesized and expressed the codon-optimized FbFP gene for C. beijerinckii (CbFbFP) based on the nucleotide sequence of Bacillus subtilis YtvA variant EcFbFP in C. beijerinckii NCIMB 8052 wild-type. Protein expression and in vivo fluorescence of CbFbFP in C. beijeirnckii were confirmed under anaerobic growth conditions. Through fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), we isolated the bright cells from the heterogenous population of C. beijerinckii cells expressing CbFbFP. Several mutations were found in the isolated plasmid which may be responsible for the high-level expression of CbFbFP in C. beijerinckii. The mutant plasmid and CbFbFP reporter were further utilized for strain selection, real-time fluorescence measurement, population analysis, and metabolic engineering in this study.

   DATABASE
AB Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus are two evolutionary distant bacterial species that are frequently isolated from persistent infections such as chronic infectious wounds and severe lung infections in cystic fibrosis patients. To the best of our knowledge no comprehensive genome scale co-expression study has been already conducted on these two species and in most cases only the expression of very few genes has been the subject of investigation. In this study, in order to investigate the level of expressional conservation between these two species, using heterogeneous gene expression datasets the weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) approach was applied to study both single and cross species genome scale co-expression patterns of these two species. Single species co-expression network analysis revealed that in P. aeruginosa, genes involved in quorum sensing (QS), iron uptake, nitrate respiration and type III secretion systems and in S. aureus, genes associated with the regulation of carbon metabolism, fatty acid-phospholipids metabolism and proteolysis represent considerable co-expression across a variety of experimental conditions. Moreover, the comparison of gene co-expression networks between P. aeruginosa and S. aureus was led to the identification of four co-expressed gene modules in both species totally consisting of 318 genes. Several genes related to two component signal transduction systems, small colony variants (SCVs) morphotype and protein complexes were found in the detected modules. We believe that targeting the key players among the identified co-expressed orthologous genes will be a potential intervention strategy to control refractory co-infections caused by these two bacterial species.

AB We prepared to investigate the association of four well-defined polymorphisms in the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) gene with the changes of fasting blood soluble RAGE (sRAGE) and endogenous secretory RAGE (esRAGE) and the risk for impaired glucose metabolism (IGM) in 1704 patients with primary hypertension, aiming to infer possible causality between sRAGE/esRAGE and IGM. This was a hospital-based case-control study, including 848 patients coexisting with IGM (the case group) and 856 patients with normal glucose tolerance (the control group). Fasting blood sRAGE and esRAGE concentrations were measured in 300 cases and 300 controls. There were significant differences in the genotypes/alleles of T-429C (rs1800625) and T-374A (rs1800624) polymorphisms between the case and control groups after Bonferroni correction (P < 0.05/8). Adjusted estimates of above two polymorphisms for IGM risk were remarkably significant, especially under the recessive model (odd ratio [OR], 95% confidence interval [CI], P: 3.57, 1.95-5.18, 0.002 for T-429C and 3.49, 1.42-8.58, 0.007 for T-374A). Mean sRAGE and esRAGE concentrations were significantly higher in controls than in cases (P < 0.001). Participants with the rs1800625-429CC and-429TC genotypes had significantly lower sRAGE (417.3 and 473.6 vs. 502.3 pg/mL, P < 0.01) and esRAGE (230.1 and 298.0 vs. 340.4 pg/mL, P < 0.05) concentrations than those with the-429TT genotype in primary hypertensive patients with IGM. Further Mendelian randomization analysis revealed that per 100 pg/mL reduction in fasting blood sRAGE and esRAGE was causally associated with 2.40-fold (95% CI: 1.46-3.94) and 2.65-fold (95% CI: 1.24-5.13) increased IGM risk, respectively. Our findings collectively demonstrate that fasting blood sRAGE and esRAGE may be causally implicated in IGM in primary hypertensive patients.

AB Toll receptors are important pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) in shrimps, which play a vital role in defending against virus and bacterial challenge. In this paper, the characterization and functional analysis of a Toll9 receptor gene from Penaeus monodon was performed in HEK293T cells. Data showed that PmToll9 can activate the NF-kappa B promoter activities of TLR pathway, while ISRE and IFN-beta promoter cannot be activated obviously in HEK293T cells using dual-luciferase reporter system. The downstream immune factors of IL-8, I kappa Ba, and TRAF6 were activated by PmToll9 and IL-8 showed the most significant up-regulation in expression levels, indicating the activities of NF-KB can be mediated by PmToll9. Six LRRs-deletion mutants were constructed and results showed these mutants had obvious declines in luciferase activities, among which the mutant pCMV-DeLRR4 showed the most significant decline. qPCR data indicated LRRs-deletion mutants efficiently impaired the activities of the downstream immune factors IL-8, I kappa B-alpha, and TRAF6. It demonstrates that LRRs-deletion mutants could result in the weaken abilities of PmToll9 in signaling transduction. Overexpression of PmToll9-GFP fusion protein in Hela cells revealed the primary cellular localization of PmToll9 is in the cytoplasm.

AB In prokaryotic cells, the UvrB protein plays a central role in nucleotide excision repair, which is involved in the recognition of bulky DNA lesions generated by chemical or physical agents. The present investigation aimed to characterize the uvrB gene of Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis (CpuvrB) and evaluate its involvement in the DNA repair system of this pathogenic organism. In computational analysis, the alignment of the UvrB protein sequences of Escherichia colt, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Bacillus caldotenax and Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis showed high similarity and the catalytic amino acid residues and functional domains are preserved. A CpUvrB model was constructed by comparative modeling and presented structural similarity with the UvrB of E. coll. Moreover, in molecular docking analysis CpUvrB showed favorable interaction with EcUvrA and revealed a preserved ATP incorporation site. Heterologous functional complementation assays using E. colt uvrB-deficient cells exposed to UV irradiation showed that the CpUvrB protein contributed to an increased survival rate in relation to those in the absence of CpUvrB. Damaged oligonucleotides containing thymine dimer or 8-oxoguanine lesion were synthesized and incubated with CpUvrB protein, which was able to recognize and excise UV irradiation damage but not 8-oxoguanine. These results suggest that CpUvrB is involved in repairing lesions derived from UV light and encodes a protein orthologous to EcUvrB.

AB Hypoxia is one of the critical environmental stressors for fish in aquatic environments. Although accumulating evidences indicate that gene expression is regulated by hypoxia stress in fish, how genes undergoing differential gene expression and/or alternative splicing (AS) in response to hypoxia stress in heart are not well understood. Using RNA-seq, we surveyed and detected 289 differential expressed genes (DEG) and 103 genes that undergo differential usage of exons and splice junctions events (DUES) in heart of a hypoxia tolerant fish, Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus following 12 h hypoxic treatment. The spatio-temporal expression analysis validated the significant association of differential exon usages in two randomly selected DUES genes (fam162a and ndrg2) in 5 tissues (heart, liver, brain, gill and spleen) sampled at three time points (6 h, 12 h, and 24 h) under acute hypoxia treatment. Functional analysis significantly associated the differential expressed genes with the categories related to energy conservation, protein synthesis and immune response. Different enrichment categories were found between the DEG and DUES dataset. The Isomerase activity, Oxidoreductase activity, Glycolysis and Oxidative stress process were significantly enriched for the DEG gene dataset, but the Structural constituent of ribosome and Structural molecule activity, Ribosomal protein and RNA binding protein were significantly enriched only for the DUES genes. Our comparative transcriptomic analysis reveals abundant stress responsive genes and their differential regulation function in the heart tissues of Nile tilapia under acute hypoxia stress. Our findings will facilitate future investigation on transcriptome complexity and AS regulation during hypoxia stress in fish.

AB Objective: ACE I/D and MTHFR C677T gene polymorphisms can be seen as candidate genes for glioma on the basis of their biological functions and their involvement in different cancers. The aim of this study was to analyze potential association and overall survival between MTHFR C677T and ACE I/D polymorphism in glioma patients in our population.
   Materials and methods: We tested genotype distribution of 112 glioma patients against 141 cancer-free controls from the same region. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed to evaluate overall survival of patients for both genes.
   Results: No significant differences were found among MTHFR C677T wild type C and variant genotypes CT/TT with glioma patients. In ACE, the distribution of variant ID and DD was found to be significantly higher in glioma cases as compared to controls (p < 0.0001). ACE DD genotypes were highly presented in glioma cases 26.8% versus 10.6% in controls (p < 0.0001) and conferred 5-fold risk for predisposition in glioma cases. Per copy D allele frequency was found higher in cases than in controls (0.54 versus 0.25: p < 0.0001). Interestingly we found a significant overall survival (with log rank p < 0.01) in patients who presented with ACE DD genotypes had the least estimated overall survival of 13.4 months in comparison to 21. 7 and 17.6 months for ACE II and I/D genotypes respectively.
   Conclusion: We conclude ACE I/D polymorphism plays a vital role in predisposition of higher risk for glioma. We also suggest that ACE DD genotypes may act as an important predictive biomarker for overall survival of glioma patients.

AB Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is a member of the fibroblast growth factors family. It is a highly specific mitogenic factor for many cell types, as though it be involved in wound repair, angiogenesis, nerve nutrition and embryonic development etc. Oil bodies have been applied for medicine, foodstuff and industry field. The heterogonous proteins expressed in oil bodies have distinct advantages, such as less purification steps and low costs. In this study, bFGF was expressed in A. thaliana seeds using oleosin fusion technology. The pOTB-bFGF vector contained an oleosin-bFGF fusion gene and a glufosinate resistance gene for selection. Transgenic A. thaliana lines were obtained by the floral dip method and protein expression was identified by SDS-PAGE and western blotting in transgenic A. thaliana lines. Moreover, MTT assays showed that the oil bodies expressed oleosin-bFGF fusion protein had a remarkable proliferation effect on NIH/3T3 cells and animal experiments showed that it could effectively decrease wound size and accelerate granulation tissue maturation. In conclusion, this may be a better method of producing oleosin-bFGF fusion protein to meet the increasing demand in its pharmacological application.

AB Complexity in tissues affected by cancer arises from somatic mutations and epigenetic modifications in the genome. The mutation susceptible hotspots present within the genome indicate a non-random nature and/or a position specific selection of mutation. An association exists between the occurrence of mutations and epigenetic DNA methylation. This study is primarily aimed at determining mutation status, and identifying a signature for predicting mutation prone zones of tumor suppressor (TS) genes. Nearby sequences from the top five positions having a higher mutation frequency in each gene of 42 TS genes were selected from a cosmic database and were considered as mutation prone zones. The conserved motifs present in the mutation prone DNA fragments were identified. Molecular docking studies were done to determine putative interactions between the identified conserved motifs and enzyme methyltransferase DNMT1. Collective analysis of 42 TS genes found GC as the most commonly replaced and AT as the most commonly formed residues after mutation. Analysis of the top 5 mutated positions of each gene (210 DNA segments for 42 TS genes) identified that CG nucleotides of the amino acid codons (e.g., Arginine) are most susceptible to mutation, and found a consensus DNA "T/AGC/GAGGA/TG" sequence present in these mutation prone DNA segments. Similar to TS genes, analysis of 54 oncogenes not only found CG nucleotides of the amino acid Arg as the most susceptible to mutation, but also identified the presence of similar consensus DNA motifs in the mutation prone DNA fragments (270 DNA segments for 54 oncogenes) of oncogenes. Docking studies depicted that, upon binding of DNMT1 methylates to this consensus DNA motif (C residues of CpG islands), mutation was likely to occur. Thus, this study proposes that DNMT1 mediated methylation in chromosomal DNA may decrease if a foreign DNA segment containing this consensus sequence along with CG nucleotides is exogenously introduced to dividing cancer cells.

AB Severe oligozoospermia (SO) is a common disease resulting in male infertility; however, its pathophysiology remains unclear. Here, we report two brothers with SO. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) identified a hemizygous variant in HAUS7 (c.G386T:p.G129V), an X-linked gene. HAUS7 has been reported to play a role in the meiotic maturation and chromosome alignment of germ cells. The two patients inherited this variant from their mother, and this variant was considered to be a highly pathogenic mutation by in silico analysis. Moreover, in vitro fertilization (IVF)/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) was carried out in both the proband's wife and the brother's wife, but they failed to become pregnant after the embryo transfers. Therefore, this novel mutation in HAUS7 gene may be associated with severe oligozoospermia.

AB Follistatin (FST), a single-chain glycosylated protein, is expressed in various tissues. The essential biological function of FST is binding and neutralizing transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) superfamily, including activin, myostatin, and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP). Emerging evidence indicates that FST also serves as a stress responsive protein, which plays a protective role under a variety of stresses. In most cases, FST performs the protective function through its neutralization of TGF-beta superfamily. However, under certain circumstances, FST translocates into the nucleus to maintain cellular homeostasis independent of its extracellular antagonism activity. This review provides integrated insight into the most recent advances in understanding the role of FST under various stresses, and the clinical implications corresponding to these findings and discusses the mechanisms to be further studied.

AB Growth-regulating factors (GRFs) are plant-specific transcription factors that have important functions in regulating plant growth and development. GRF gene families have been described in several plant species, but a comprehensive analysis of the GRF gene family in tobacco has not yet been reported. In this study, we identified 25 NtabGRF genes in N. tabacum. The gene structures, motifs, and cis-acting regulatory elements of the NtabGRF genes were analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis divided the genes into six clusters. Additionally, highly conserved regions of microsynteny were identified in all of the sequenced tobacco species. Expression analysis showed that NtabGRF genes were highly expressed in actively growing tissues and responded to various hormone treatments. Our results provide foundational information about the GRF gene family in tobacco species, and open the door for future research on the functions of these genes.

AB Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) is a highly conserved pathway that repairs Double-Strand Breaks (DSBs) within DNA. Here we show that the deletion of yeast uncharacterized ORF HUR1, Hydroxyurea Resistancel affects the efficiency of NHEJ. Our findings are supported by Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI), genetic interaction and drug sensitivity analyses. To assess the activity of HURL in DSB repair, we deleted its non-overlapping region with PMR1, referred to as HURL A. We observed that similar to deletion of TPK1 and NEJ1, and unlike YKU70 (important for NHEJ of DNA with overhang and not blunt end), deletion of HUR1-A reduced the efficiency of NHEJ in both overhang and blunt end plasmid repair assays. Similarly, a chromosomal repair assay showed a reduction for repair efficiency when HUR1-A was deleted. In agreement with a functional connection for Hurlp with Tpklp and NEJ1p, double mutant strains Delta hur1-A/Delta tpk1, and Delta hurl-A/Delta nejl showed the samereduction in the efficiency of plasmid repair, compared to both single deletion strains. Also, using a Homologous Recombination (HR) specific plasmid-based DSB repair assay we observed that deletion of HUR1-A influenced the efficiency of HR repair, suggesting that HURL might also play additional roles in other DNA repair pathways.

AB Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are ubiquitous enzymes which play versatile functions including cellular detoxification and stress tolerance. In this study, a comprehensive genome-wide identification of GST gene family was carried out in potato (Solarium tuberosum L.). The result demonstrated the presence of at least 90 GST genes in potato which is greater than any other reported species. According to the phylogenetic analyses of Arabidopsis, rice and potato GST members, GSTs could be subdivided into ten different classes and each class is found to be highly conserved. The largest class of potato GST family is tau with 66 members, followed by phi and lambda. The chromosomal localization analysis revealed the highly uneven distribution of StGST genes across the potato genome. Transcript profiling of 55 StGST genes showed the tissue-specific expression for most of the members. Moreover, expression of StGST genes were mainly repressed in response to abiotic stresses, while largely induced in response to biotic and hormonal elicitations. Further analysis of StGST gene's promoter identified the presence of various stress responsive cis-regulatory elements. Moreover, one of the highly stress responsive StGST members, StGSTU46, showed strong affinity towards fiurazole with lowest binding energy of -7.6 kcal/mol that could be used as antidote to protect crop against herbicides. These findings will facilitate the further functional and evolutionary characterization of GST genes in potato.

AB Campylobacter jejuni (C. jejuni) is a major cause of bacterial food-borne illness in humans. It is considered a commensal organism of the chicken gut and infected chickens serve as a reservoir and shed bacteria throughout their lifespan. Contaminated poultry products are considered the major source of infection in humans. Therefore, to reduce the risk of human campylobacteriosis, it is essential to reduce the bacterial load in poultry products. The present study aimed to. evaluate the protective effects of soluble and PLGA-encapsulated oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) containing unmethylated CpG motifs (E-CpG ODN) as well as C. jejuni lysate as a multi-antigen vaccine against colonization with C. jejuni. The results revealed that oral administration of a low (5 mu g) or high (50 mu g) dose of CpG resulted in a significant reduction in cecal C. jejuni colonization by 1.23 and 1.32 log(10) (P < .05) in layer chickens, respectively, whereas E-CpG significantly reduced cecal C jejuni colonization by 1.89 and 1.46 log(10) in layer and broiler chickens at day 22 post-infection (slaughter age in broilers), respectively. Similar patterns were observed for C jejuni lysate; oral administration of C jejuni lysate reduced the intestinal burden of C jejuni in layer and broiler chickens by 2.24 and 2.14 log(10) at day 22 post-infection, respectively. Moreover, the combination of E-CpG and C jejuni lysate reduced bacterial counts in cecal contents by 2.42 log(10) at day 22 post infection in broiler chickens. Anti-C. jejuni IgG antibody (Ab) titers were significantly higher for broiler chickens receiving a low or high dose of E-CpG or a low dose of C. jejuni lysate than for chickens receiving the placebo. Furthermore, a positive correlation was observed between serum IgG Ab titers and cecal counts of C jejuni in these groups. These findings suggest that PLGA-encapsulated CpG or C jejuni lysate could be a promising strategy for control of C jejuni in chickens. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: If immune responses to vaccination differ between males and females, sex-specific vaccination schedules may be indicated. We systematically reanalysed childhood vaccination studies conducted in The Netherlands for sex-differences in IgG-responses. To assess the impact of potential sex-differences in IgG-responses, we explored sex-differences in vaccine failure/effectiveness and reactogenicity.
   Methods: Six studies with IgG-measurements for 1577 children following infant pneumococcal (PCV7/PCV10/PCV13) and/or DTaP-IPV-Hib(-HepB) vaccinations, or the pre-school DTaP-IPV booster were included. We performed one-stage individual participant data meta-analyses per time-point of the effect of sex on IgG levels against pneumococcal serotypes, diphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid, pertussis Ptx/FHA/Pm and Hib-PRP using linear mixed models. Using existing study data, we compared reactogenicity after PCV7/PCV10 and DTaP-IPV-Hib(-HepB) vaccination in girls and boys. Vaccine failure/effectiveness was compared between girls and boys for invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), invasive Hib disease and pertussis using notification data.
   Results: For pneumococcal vaccination, the geometric mean concentration ratio of IgG levels in girls versus boys pooled across serotypes was 1.15 (95%Cl 0.91-1.45) 1 month following the primary series, 1.16 (1.02-1.32) at age 8 months, 1.12 (1.02-1.23) pre-booster (age 11 months) and 0.99 (0.89-1.10) post booster (age 12 months). Diphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid, pertussis Ptx/FHA/Prn and Hib-PRP IgG levels did not differ between girls and boys, except for Hib post-booster (1.24; 95%Cl 1.01-1.52) and tetanus before pre-school booster (0.71; 0.53-0.95). We found no difference between boys and girls in reactogenicity at age 4 or 11 months or in vaccine failure/effectiveness for IPD, invasive Hib disease or pertussis.
   Conclusion: For most vaccine antigens investigated, there were no consistent differences in vaccine-induced IgG levels. Vaccine-induced pneumococcal IgG levels were slightly higher in girls, but only between the primary series and the 11-month booster. These results, along with similar reactogenicity and vaccine failure/effectiveness, support the uniform infant vaccination schedule in the Dutch national immunisation programme.

AB Background: In Quebec, 7-valent (PCV7), 10-valent (PCV10) and 13-valent (PCV13) pneumococcal conjugate vaccines were successively used for the immunization of children according to a 2+1 doses schedule. Objective: Our aim was to assess the impact of this program on the epidemiology of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in children and adults.
   Methods: Notification and laboratory surveillance data were analyzed and the immunization status of IPD cases in children was checked. Results: In children < 5 years, the IPD rate decreased from 69/100,000 in 2003 to 12/100,000 in 2016 (83% reduction). Following P0/7 introduction in 2004, there has been a rapid decline in PCV7-type IPD cases and 6A. 7F and 19A serotypes emerged but their incidence decreased following PCV10 introduction in 2009 and PCV13 in 2011, whereas decrease in serotype 3 IPD was modest. Non-PCV13 types increased and represented 79% of cases in 2016. The same pattern was seen in adults but replacement was complete and there was no decrease in overall IPD rate. In those 65 years and over, PCV13 serotypes represented 28% of cases in 2016 and 62% were serotypes included in the 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine. Out of 10 IPD cases caused by serotype 3 in children vaccinated with P0/13 in 2011-2016, 6 occurred more than one year following the booster dose, which suggests short-term protection. Out of 31 breakthrough 19A cases, 19 occurred in children aged between 8 and 14 months who had received the 2 primary PCV13 doses but not the toddler booster dose, which suggests a window of susceptibility in a 2+1 schedule.
   Conclusion: PCVs had a major impact on the IPD rate in children but not in adults. Among elderly adults, the proportion of cases caused by serotypes included in PCV13 is diminishing year after year but a majority of cases remains covered by the 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine. @ 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB New vaccines designed to prevent diseases endemic in low and middle -income countries (LMICs) are now being introduced without prior record of utilization in countries with robust pharmacovigilance systems. To address this deficit, our objective was to demonstrate feasibility of an international hospital based network for the assessment of potential epidemiological associations between serious and rare adverse events and vaccines in any setting. This was done through a proof-of-concept evaluation of the risk of immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and aseptic meningitis (AM) following administration of the first dose of measles-mumps-containing vaccines using the self-controlled risk interval method in the primary analysis. The World Health Organization (WHO) selected 26 sentinel sites (49 hospitals) distributed in 16 countries of the six WHO regions. Incidence rate ratios (IRR) of 5.0 (95% CI: 2.5-9.7) for ITP following first dose of measles-containing vaccinations, and of 10.9 (95% CI: 4.2-27.8) for AM following mumps-containing vaccinations were found. The strain-specific analyses showed significantly elevated ITP risk for measles vaccines containing Schwarz (IRR: 20.7; 95% CI: 2.7-157.6), Edmonston- Zagreb (IRR: 11.1; 95% CI: 1.4-90.3), and Enders'Edmonston (IRR: 8.5; 95% CI: 1.9-38.1) strains. A significantly elevated AM risk for vaccines containing the Leningrad-Zagreb mumps strain (IRR: 10.8; 95% CI: 1.3-87.4) was also found. This proof-of-concept study has shown, for the first time, that an international hospital-based network for the investigation of rare vaccine adverse events, using common standardized procedures and with high participation of LMICs, is feasible, can produce reliable results, and has the potential to characterize differences in risk between vaccine strains. The completion of this network by adding large reference hospitals, particularly from tropical countries, and the systematic WHO-led implementation of this approach, should permit the rapid post-marketing evaluation of safety signals for serious and rare adverse events for new and existing vaccines in all settings, including LMICs.

AB Timely and effective evaluation of vaccine safety signals for newly developed vaccines introduced in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) is essential. The study tested the development of a global network of hospital-based sentinel sites for vaccine safety signal verification and hypothesis testing. Twenty-six sentinel sites in sixteen countries across all WHO regions participated, and 65% of the sites were from LMIC. We describe the process for the establishment and operationalization of such a network and the lessons learned in conducting a multi-country collaborative initiative. 24 out of the 26 sites successfully contributed data for the global analysis using standardised tools and procedures. Our study successfully confirmed the well-known risk estimates for the outcomes of interest. The main challenges faced by investigators were lack of adequate information in the medical records for case ascertainment and classification, and access to immunization data. The results suggest that sentinel hospitals intending to participate in vaccine safety studies strengthen their systems for discharge diagnosis coding, medical records and linkage to vaccination data. Our study confirms that a multi-country hospital-based network initiative for vaccine safety monitoring is feasible and demonstrates the validity and utility of large collaborative international studies to monitor the safety of new vaccines introduced in LMICs.

AB New vaccines designed to prevent diseases endemic in low and middle-income countries are being introduced without prior utilization in countries with robust vaccine pharmacovigilance systems. Our aim was to build capacity for active surveillance of vaccine adverse events in the Americas. We describe the implementation of a proof-of-concept study for the feasibility of an international collaborative hospital-based active surveillance system for vaccine safety. The study was developed and implemented in 15 sentinel sites located in seven countries of the region of the Americas, under the umbrella of the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Vaccine Safety Initiative. The study evaluated the associations between measles-mumps-rubella vaccines and two well-recognized adverse events: Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and aseptic meningitis. The regional network contributed 63 confirmed ITP and 16 confirmed aseptic meningitis eligible cases to the global study, representing, respectively, 33% and 19% of the total cases. To ensure long-term sustainability and usefulness to investigate adverse events following new vaccine introductions in low and middle-income countries, the network needs to be strengthened with additional sites and integrated into national health systems.

AB Background: Helicobacter pylori, a gram-negative bacterium, is the causative agent of gastric disorders and gastric cancer in the human stomach. Vacuolating cytotoxin A (VacA) is among the multi-effect protein toxins released by H. pylori that enables its persistence in the human stomach.
   Methods: To evaluate the effect of anti-VacA egg yolk immunoglobulin (anti-VacA IgY) on H. pylori infection, a highly specific anti-VacA IgY was produced from egg yolks of hens immunized with a mixture of two purified recombinant VacAs. Female C57BL/6 mice were supplemented anti-VacA IgY daily with drinking water for 2 weeks before and 4 weeks after H. pylori ATCC 43504 inoculation. Anti-VacA IgY recognized both native and denatured structures of VacA by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunoblotting analyses, respectively.
   Results: Oral administration of anti-VacA IgYs significantly (p < .05) reduced the serum levels of anti-H. pylori antibodies compared to those in the H. pylori-infected, untreated group. The reduction in the immune response was accompanied by a significant (p < .05) decrease in eosinophilic infiltration of the stomach in anti-VacA IgY treated group compared to other groups. Concomitantly, H. pylori-induced histological changes and H. pylori antigen-positivity in gastric tissues were decreased significantly (p < .05) in anti-VacA IgY treated group similar to the control group.
   Conclusions: Oral administration of anti-VacA IgY is correlated with a protective effect against H. pylori colonization and induced histological changes in gastric tissues. Our experimental study has proved that it is expected to be a new drug candidate of Hp infection by further study. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   Methods: In phase A of the study, healthy children aged 12-22 months from ten European countries were randomized (3:3:1) and received either two doses of MMRV, or one dose of combined MMR and one dose of monovalent varicella vaccine (MMR+V), or two doses of the MMR vaccine (control), 42 days apart. Vaccine efficacy against all and against moderate or severe varicella (confirmed by detection of viral DNA or epidemiological link) was assessed from six weeks up to six years post-dose 2 for the MMRV and MMR+V groups, and was calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CI). The severity of varicella was calculated using the modified Vazquez scale (mild <= 7; moderately severe = 8-15; severe >= 16). Herpes zoster cases were also recorded.
   Results: 5289 children (MMRV = 2279, mean age = 14.2, standard deviation [SD] = 2.5; MMR+V = 2266, mean age = 14.2, SD = 2.4; MMR = 744, mean age = 14.2, SD = 2.5 months) were included in the efficacy cohort. 815 varicella cases were confirmed. Efficacy of two doses of MMRV against all and against moderate or severe varicella was 95.0% (95% CI: 93.6-96.2) and 99.0% (95% CI: 97.7-99.6), respectively. Efficacy of one dose of varicella vaccine against all and against moderate or severe varicella was 67.0% (95% CI: 61.8-71.4) and 90.3% (95% CI: 86.9-92.8), respectively. There were four confirmed herpes zoster cases (MMR+V = 2, MMR = 2), all were mild and three tested positive for the wild-type virus.
   Conclusions: Two doses of the MMRV vaccine and one dose of the varicella vaccine remain efficacious through six years post-vaccination. (C) 2017 GlaxoSmithKline SA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is an open access article under the CC BY license.

AB Objectives: In 2012, British Columbia (BC) became the first Canadian province to implement an influenza prevention policy requiring healthcare workers (HCW) to either be vaccinated annually against influenza or wear a mask in patient care areas during the influenza season. This study describes an evaluation of influenza policy implementation processes and identifies supports and challenges related to successful policy implementation at the level of healthcare facilities, during the second policy year (2013/14).
   Methods: Implementation leaders from 262 long-term care (LTC) and acute care facilities, mostly in three of BC's five regional Health Authorities, were invited to participate in an online survey following the 2013/14 influenza season. Descriptive quantitative and qualitative analyses identified common and effective strategies for improving vaccination coverage and policy compliance.
   Results: A total of 127 respondents completed the survey on behalf of 33 acute care and 99 LTC facilities, representing 36% of acute care and 27% of LTC facilities in BC. Respondents agreed that the policy was successfully implemented at 89% of facilities, and implementation was reported to be easy at 52% of facilities. The findings elaborate on communication and leadership strategies, campaign logistics and enforcement approaches involved in policy implementation.
   Conclusion: Implementation of a vaccinate-or-mask influenza policy is complex. This study provides insight for other jurisdictions considering implementing such a policy and offers practical recommendations for facilities and health authorities. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID INTRANASAL INOCULATION; GNOTOBIOTIC PIGLETS; INFECTION; PNEUMONIA
AB Lameness and polyserositis in pigs caused by Mycoplasma hyorhinis are generally treated with antibiotics and may require multiple doses. The costs of these antibiotics combined with economic losses from culling and reduced feed conversion due to lameness are hardships to the swine producer. In this study we have demonstrated efficacy of an inactivated M. hyorhinis vaccine administered to three-week old caesarian-derived colostrum-deprived piglets. Three doses of vaccine (high, medium, and low) were evaluated and compared to a placebo control. Mycoplasma hyorhinis challenge occurred three weeks after vaccination. Pigs were observed for lameness and respiratory distress for three weeks following challenge. Pigs were then euthanized and a gross pathological evaluation for polyserositis and arthritis was performed. A minimum immunizing dose of vaccine was defined as containing at least 7.41 x 10(7) CCU of M. hyorhinis per 2.0 mL dose as represented by the medium dose vaccine. This vaccine provided significant reductions in lameness and pericarditis with preventive fractions of 0.76 (95% CI [0.26, 0.92]) and 0.58 (95% CI [0.31, 0.74]), respectively, compared to the placebo control group. A significant increase in post-challenge weight gain (P <.0001) was also achieved with this vaccine, with an average daily gain (ADG) of 0.92 lbs/day compared to 0.57 lbs/day in the placebo group.

TI Cost-effectiveness of dengue vaccination in ten endemic countries
SO VACCINE
LA English
DT Article
ID CHILDREN; BURDEN; PROGRAMS
AB Following publication of results from two phase-3 clinical trials in 10 countries or territories, endemic countries began licensing the first dengue vaccine in 2015. Using a published mathematical model, we evaluated the cost-effectiveness of dengue vaccination in populations similar to those at the trial sites in those same Latin American and Asian countries. Our main scenarios (30-year horizon, 80% coverage) entailed 3-dose routine vaccinations costing US$20/dose beginning at age 9, potentially supplemented by catch-up programs of 4- or 8-year cohorts. We obtained illness costs per case, dengue mortality, vaccine wastage, and vaccine administration costs from the literature. We estimated that routine vaccination would reduce yearly direct and indirect illness cost per capita by 22% (from US$10.51 to US$8.17) in the Latin American countries and by 23% (from US$5.78 to US$4.44) in the Asian countries. Using a health system perspective, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) averaged US$4,216/disabilityadjusted life year (DALY) averted in the five Latin American countries (range: US$666/DALY in Puerto Rico to US$5,865/DALY in Mexico). In the five Asian countries, the ICER averaged US$3,751/DALY (range: US$1,935/DALY in Malaysia to US$5,101/DALY in the Philippines). From a health system perspective, the vaccine proved to be highly cost effective (ICER under one times the per capita GDP) in seven countries and cost effective (ICER 1-3 times the per capita GDP) in the remaining three countries. From a societal perspective, routine vaccination proved cost-saving in three countries. Including catch-up campaigns gave similar ICERs. Thus, this vaccine could have a favorable economic value in sites similar to those in the trials. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Anti-PD-1 therapy is a novel immune-checkpoint inhibition therapy with tremendous potential in treating refractory/relapsed cancers. The 20 year journey of human PD-1 research went through 3 phases: 1) discovering PD-1 gene structure and genomic organization, 2) understanding the mechanism of PD-1 mediated immune checkpoint regulatory effects in coordination with its ligands (PD-Ll and L2), 3) and translating our knowledge of PD-1 gene into a robust clinical anticancer approach by targeting the PD-1 immune-checkpoint pathway. The success of human PD-1 gene study reflects the advancement and trends of modern biomedical research from the laboratory to the bedside. However, our journey of understanding the PD-1 gene is not yet complete. Clinical investigation data show a high variety of response rates among different types of cancers to PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibition therapy, with a range of 18% to 87%. There is no reliable biomarker to predict an individual patient's response to PD-1 inhibitory immunotherapy. Patients can present with primary, adaptive, or even acquired resistance to PD-1 immune-checkpoint inhibition therapy. Furthermore, the emerging data demonstrates that certain patients experience hyperprogressive disease status after receiving PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibition therapy. In conclusion, PD-1 immune-checkpoint inhibition therapy has opened up a new venue of advanced cancer immunotherapy. Meanwhile, further efforts are still warranted in both basic scientific mechanism studies and clinical investigation using the principles of personalized and precision medicine.

AB The present study was conducted to clarify the involvement of the basement membrane (BM) in insect metamorphosis through analysis of the expression profile of two types of metalloproteinase (MMP and ADAMTS) genes in several organs, their ecdysone involvement, and the histological change of BM. BM was observed around wing sac and in the wing cavity and around fat bodies at the WO stage but disappeared after the W3 stage, and wing discs evaginated and fat body cells scattered after the W3 stage. The disappearance of the BM of midgut and silk glands was not observed after the W3 stage, but degenerated epithelium cells in the midgut and shrunken cells in the silk gland were observed after the W3 stage. BmMMP1 showed a peak at PO in the wing discs, fat bodies, midgut, and silk gland. BmMMP2 showed a broad peak around pupation in the wing discs, fat bodies, midgut, and silk gland. BmADAMTS-1 showed enhanced expression at W2 in the wing discs, fat bodies, midgut, and hemocyte, while BmADAMTS-L showed enhanced expression at W3 in the fat bodies, midgut, silk gland, and hemocyte. After pupation, they showed a different expression in different organs. All of four genes were induced by 20-hydroxyecdysone in wing discs in vitro. The present results suggested the involvement of MMPs and ADAMTS in the BM digestion and the morphogenesis of organs during Bombyx metamorphosis.

AB BCA2/RNF115/Rabring7 is a RING type E3 ubiquitin ligase that is overexpressed in human breast tumors and is important for regulating breast cancer cell migration. In the present investigation, feline BCA2 (fBCA2) was identified and characterized. Compared with its human counterpart, the fBCA2 cDNA was confirmed to be 918 base pairs in length showing 92.6% consensus and identity positions, encoding a protein of 305 amino acids with 96.7% consensus and 93.1% identity positions. The fBCA2 protein contains a RING domain at the C-terminus, which was found to be essential for its autoubiquitination.

Here, an alfalfa (Medicago sativa) transcriptome dataset was analyzed and three new RNA viruses were identified, which were named Medicago sativa alphapartitivirus 1 (MsAPV1), Medicago sativa deltapartitivirus 1 (MsDPV1), and Medicago sativa marafivirus 1 (MsMV1). The RNA-dependent RNA polymerases of MsAPV1, MsDPV1, and MsMV1 showed about 68%, 58%, and 46% amino acid sequence identity, respectively, with their closest virus species. Sequence similarity and phylogenetic analyses indicated that MsAPV1, MsDPV1, and MsMV1 were novel RNA virus species that belong to the genus Alphapartitivirus of the family Partitiviridae, the genus Deltapartitivirus of the family Partitiviridae, and the genus Marafivirus of the family Tymoviridae, respectively. The bioinformatics procedure applied in this study may facilitate the identification of novel RNA viruses from plant transcriptome data.

AB Vasa, an enzyme belonging to the helicase family, contributes to the regulation of reproductive system development in many species. Thus, we hypothesized that the Vasa3 gene may function in the reproductive system of the parasite Schistosoma japonicum (S. japonicum), which is a major causative agent of schistosomiasis. It is a severe disease globally affecting humans and animals. To test this hypothesis, we firstly conducted whole mount in situ hybridization analyses and found that the S. japonicum Vasa3 (SjVasa3) gene was expressed mainly in the reproductive organs. We then explored the reproductive functions of Vasa3 in S. japonicum using RNA interference (RNAi) techniques. Coupled schistosomes collected from mice 28 days post infection (dpi) were transfected three times with SjVasa3-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) and cultured in vitro for up to 10 days. As measured by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and Western blot analysis, levels of SjVasa3 mRNA and protein in Vasa siRNA treated worms were significantly reduced compared with untreated and scrambled siRNA treated worms. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) images showed markedly siRNA induced changes in the morphology of the reproductive organs, especially in the female ovary, vitellarium and the male testes. SjVasa3 gene silencing also significantly reduced egg production. These data demonstrate that SjVasa3 is essential in reproductive organ development and egg production in S. japonicum, and could be a potential target for developing novel compounds to treat schistosomiasis.

AB Considerable studies demonstrate that plant transcription factors (TFs) play key regulatory roles in abiotic/biotic stress conditions, such as drought and pathogen attack. However, there is no effort dedicated to curate experimentally validated stress-TF regulatory relationships from these individual reports into a central database, which put an obstacle in the exploration of stress-TF regulations in plants. To address this issue, we presented a literature-curated database 'Stress2TF' that currently documented 1533 regulatory relationships between 71 abiotic/biotic stresses and 558 TFs in 47 plant species. Each entry in Stress2TF contains detailed information about a stress-TF relationship such as plant name, stress name, TF and brief description of stress-TF relationship. Stress2TF provided a user-friendly interface for entry browse, search and download. In addition, a submission page and several useful tools (e.g., BLAST, network visualization) were integrated. Stress2TF may be a valuable resource for the research of stress-TF regulatory mechanisms in plants. Stress2TF is available at http://csgenomics.ahau.edu.cn/Stress2TF.

DE Ankylosing spondylitis; Protein-protein interaction network
AB Background: Ankylosing spondylitis, a systemic illness is a foundation of progressing joint swelling that for the most part influences the spine. However, it frequently causes aggravation in different joints far from the spine, and in addition organs, for example, the eyes, heart, lungs, and kidneys. It's an immune system ailment that may be activated by specific sorts of bacterial or viral diseases that initiate an invulnerable reaction that don't close off after the contamination is recuperated. The particular reason for ankylosing spondylitis is obscure, yet hereditary qualities assume a huge part in this condition. The rising apparatuses of network medicine offer a stage to investigate an unpredictable illness at framework level. In this study, we meant to recognize the key proteins and the biological regulator pathways including in AS and further investigating the molecular connectivity between these pathways by the topological examination of the Protein-protein communication (PPI) system.
   Results: The extended network including of 93 nodes and have 199 interactions respectively scanned from STRING database and some separated small networks. 24 proteins with high BC at the threshold of 0.01 and 55 proteins with large degree at the threshold of 1 have been identified. CD4 with highest BC and Closeness centrality located in the centre of the network. The backbone network derived from high BC proteins presents a clear and visual overview which shows all important regulatory pathways for AS and the crosstalk between them.
   Conclusion: The finding of this research suggests that AS variation is orchestrated by an integrated PPI network centered on CD4 out of 93 nodes.

AB The homeodomain-containing transcription factor Anf (also known as Rpx/Hesx1 in mammals) plays an important role during the forebrain development in vertebrates. Here we demonstrate the ability of the Xenopus laevis Anf, Xanf1/Hesx1, to directly bind SRY-related HMG-box-containing transcription factor SoxD/Sox15 and to cooperate with the latter during regulating of the expression of Xanf1/Hesx1 own gene:As we have shown by GST pull-down, EMSA and the luciferase reporter assays, Xanf1/Hesx1 and SoxD/Sox15 bind the Xanf1/Hesx1 promoter region counteracting the inhibitory effect of Xanf1/Hesx1 alone. This finding explains how Xanf1/Hesx1 could escape the repressive activity of its own protein during early patterning of the forebrain rudiment.

AB Cotton leaf curl Burewala virus (CLCuBV, genus Begomovirus) causes devastating cotton leaf curl disease. Among various known virus controlling strategies, RNAi-mediated one has shown potential to protect host crop plants. Micro(mi) RNAs, are the endogenous small RNAs and play a key role in plant development and stress resistance. In the present study we have identified cotton (Gossypium hirsutum)-encoded miRNAs targeting the CLCuBV. Based on threshold free energy and maximum complementarity scores of host miRNA-viral mRNA target pairs, a number of potential miRNAs were annotated. Among them, ghr-miR168 was selected as the most potent candidate, capable of targeting several vital genes namely Cl, C3, C4, VI and V2 of CLCuBV genome. In addition, ghr-miR395a and ghr-miR395d were observed to target the overlapping transcripts of Cl and C4 genes. We have verified the efficacy of these miRNA targets against CLCuBV following suppression of RNAi-mediated virus control through translational inhibition or cleavage of viral mRNA.

AB ATP6V1H encodes the subunit H of vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) and has been recently proved to regulate osteoclast function. The alternative splicing of ATP6V1H gene results in two isoforms, and it is not clear whether and how the two isoforms function differently. In this report, we used bioinformatics methods to compare the differences of two isoforms in different species. The distributions and amounts of two isoforms were analyzed in eleven kinds of mouse tissues and mouse osteoclasts using RT-PCR, Q-PCR, western blot and immunohistochemical staining methods, respectively. In order to observe the in vivo biological differences of two isoforms during development, the zebrafish mRNA of two wild type atp6vlh transcripts as well as their mutant forms were also injected into zebrafish embryos, respectively. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that two isoforms were quite different in many ways, especially in protein size, internal space, phosphorylation state and H-bond binding. The amounts of two transcripts and the ratio of long and short transcript varied a lot from tissue to tissue or cell to cell, and osteoclasts were the cells only expressing long isoform among the tissues or cells we detected. The in vivo selective expression of two subunit H splice variants showed their different effects on the craniofacial development of zebrafish. The short isoform reduced the size of zebrafish head and did not play a complete function compared with the long isoform. We propose that long isoform of subunit H is necessary for the normal craniofacial bone development and the lack of short transcript might be necessary for the normal osteoclastic function.

AB Due to the wide interaction between the respiratory and the circulatory systems, influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations are recommended in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. The review summarizes the results of recent studies and meta-analyses demonstrating that in this group of high-risk patients both vaccinations have potentially beneficial properties. However, in the era of Evidence Base Medicine, there is still a lack of randomized prospective clinical trials, especially those evaluating the effect of pneumococcal vaccination. As the burden of cardiovascular diseases represents various pathologies, it is important to point that the beneficial effect of vaccination is more pronounced in the atherosclerotic etiology, especially in patients after recent coronary events. This information contributes significantly to the appreciation of the role of the adaptive and innate immunity in atherosclerosis, which is now considered as immuno-inflammatory process driven by LDL-cholesterol intimal infiltration and macrophages activation. The mechanism of the cardioprotective effect of vaccination may not only be associated with the elimination of infections and their complications, but also related to the modification of the immuno-inflammatory model of atherosclerosis.

AB The immunomodulatory effects of probiotics may influence the response to vaccines. We systematically reviewed prospective randomised placebo-controlled studies in humans that have investigated the effect of probiotics on humoral vaccine responses.
   We found 26 studies, involving 3812 participants, investigating the effect of 40 different probiotic strains on the response to 17 different vaccines. A beneficial effect of probiotics was reported in about half of the studies. The evidence for a beneficial effect of probiotics on vaccine response was strongest for oral vaccinations and for parenteral influenza vaccination. However, there was substantial variation between studies in the choice of probiotic, strain, dose, viability, purity, and duration and timing of administration. The one study that investigated the effect of probiotic administration to mothers during pregnancy found lower vaccine responses in their infants.
   The studies in our review suggest that probiotics offer a relatively cheap intervention to improve vaccine efficacy and duration of protection. Future studies should focus on establishing optimal strains, doses and timing of administration in relation to vaccination. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Trichinellosis is a foodborne disease that remains a public health hazard and an economic problem in food safety. Vaccines against the parasite can be an effective way to control this disease; however, commercial vaccines against Trichinella infection are not yet available. Trichinella cathepsin B proteins appear to be promising targets for vaccine development. Here, we reported for the first time the characterization of a novel cDNA that encodes Trichinella spiralis (T. spiralis) cathepsin B-like protease 2 gene (TsCPB2). The recombinant mature TsCPB2 protein was successfully expressed in E. coli system and purified with Niaffinity chromatography. TsCPB2 expression was detected at all the developmental stages of T. spiralis and it was expressed as an excretory secretory protein of T. spiralis muscle larvae. Immunization with TsCPB2 antigen induced a combination of humoral and cellular immune responses, which manifested as a mixed Th1/Th2 response, as well as remarkably elevated IgE level. Moreover, vaccination of mice with TsCPB2 that were subsequently challenged with T. spiralis larvae resulted in a 52.3% (P < .001) reduction in worm burden and a 51.2% (P < .001) reduction in muscle larval burden. Our results suggest that TsCPB2 induces protective immunity in Trichinella-infected mice and might be a novel vaccine candidate against trichinellosis. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background/aims: A birth dose of hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG), in combination with hepatitis B vaccine (HepB), is recommended for infants born to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive mothers. However, the optimal dosage of HBIG remains to be resolved. This prospective cohort study aimed to compare the efficacy of two dosages of HBIG combined with HepB to prevent mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HBV.
   Methods: From 2009 to 2011, we prospectively enrolled mother-infant pairs with positive maternal HBsAg in China. Infants were assigned to receive one dose of 100 IU or 200 IU HBIG within 12 h of birth according to maternal numbering, followed by completion of the 3-dose 10 mu g HepB series. At 7 months, post-vaccination serologic testing (PVST) was performed in 545 and 632 infants in 100 IU and 200 IU HBIG groups, respectively, among whom, 451 and 529 were followed up to 12 months.
   Results: Maternal and birth characteristics were comparable between infants in 100 IU and 200 IU HBIG groups. At 7 months, the rates of perinatal infection were 1.5% (8/545) and 1.9% (12/632) in 100 IU and 200 IU HBIG groups, respectively (p = .568). One non-responder infant in 200 IU HBIG group became newly infected at 12 months. The antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) positive rates were 98.5% (529/537) and 98.2% (609/620) in 100 IU and 200 IU HBIG groups at 7 months, respectively (p = .704), and the corresponding figures were 98.2% (431/439) and 97.1% (496/511) at 12 months (p = .266). The anti-HBs geometric mean concentrations were comparable between two groups at 7 months (707.95 mIU/mL vs. 602.56 mIU/mL, p = .062) and 12 months (245.47 mIU/mL vs. 229.09 mIU/mL, p = .407).
   Conclusions: One birth dose of 100 IU HBIG, combined with the HepB series, might be enough for preventing MTCT of HBV in infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Obesity is a risk factor for increased morbidity and mortality associated with many vaccine preventable infectious diseases such as influenza. Moreover, higher volume of passive rabies immunoglobulin (RIG) due to weight based dosing might suppress vaccine-induced immune responses in obese patients. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of obesity on humoral immune responses to combined equine RIG and rabies vaccine treatment among patients with WHO category III exposure to a rabies suspected animal.
   Methods: A single centre, prospective, open-labelled study among WHO category III rabies exposed patients was conducted to compare serum rabies virus neutralizing antibody (RVNA) responses measured by rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test between obese (body mass index, BMI > 30 kg/m(2)) and control (BMI < 25 kg/m(2)) patients after combined immunization with equine rabies immunoglobulin and purified chick-embryo cell rabies vaccine for post exposure prophylaxis treatment.
   Results: Post-vaccination geometric mean titer (GMT) of RVNA concentrations between two groups at day 7 were 0.33 (95% CI: 0.23, 0.46) vs 0.39 (95% CI: 0.27, 0.55), 4.61 (95% CI: 3.20, 6.63) vs 3.78 (95% CI: 2.77, 5.16) at day 14, and 7.45 (95% CI: 5.86, 9.49) vs 5.93 (95%CI: 4.46-7.90) at day 28 for obese and control patients, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference of RVNA GMT between two groups. Seroconversion to at least adequate concentration (RVNA titer >0.5 IU/mL) rates were 34% at day 7 and 100% at days 14 and 28 in both groups. There were no immediate hypersensitivity reaction and no serious adverse events observed during the study period.
   Conclusions: There was no evidence of immunosuppression of antibodies' responses in obese patients. Combined ERIG and rabies virus vaccination for post exposure treatment is safe. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) genomic variability is a major challenge to the generation of a prophylactic vaccine. We have previously shown that HCV specific T-cell responses induced by a potent T-cell vaccine encoding a single strain subtype-1b immunogen target epitopes dominant in natural infection. However, corresponding viral regions are highly variable at a population level, with a reduction in T-cell reactivity to these variants. We therefore designed and manufactured second generation simian adenovirus vaccines encoding genomic segments, conserved between viral genotypes and assessed these for immunogenicity.
   Methods: We developed a computer algorithm to identify HCV genomic regions that were conserved between viral subtypes. Conserved segments below a pre-defined diversity threshold spanning the entire HCV genome were combined to create novel immunogens (1000-1500 amino-acids), covering variation in HCV subtypes 1a and 1b, genotypes 1 and 3, and genotypes 1-6 inclusive. Simian adenoviral vaccine vectors (ChAdOx) encoding HCV conserved immunogens Were constructed. Immunogenicity was evaluated in C57BL6 mice using panels of genotype-specific peptide pools in ex-vivo IFN-gamma ELISpot and intracellular cytokine assays.
   Results: ChAdOxl conserved segment HCV vaccines primed high-magnitude, broad, cross-reactive T-cell responses; the mean magnitude of total HCV specific T-cell responses was 1174 SFU/10(6) splenocytes for ChAdOxl-GT1-6 in C57BL6 mice targeting multiple genomic regions, with mean responses of 935,1474 and 1112 SFU/10(6) against genotype 1a, 1b and 3a peptide panels, respectively. Functional assays demonstrated IFNg and TNFa production by vaccine-induced CD4 and CD8 T-cells. In silico analysis shows that conserved immunogens contain multiple epitopes, with many described in natural HCV infection, predicting immunogenicity in humans.
   Conclusions: Simian adenoviral vectored vaccines encoding genetic segments that are conserved between all major HCV genotypes contain multiple T-cell epitopes and are highly immunogenic in pre-clinical models. These studies pave the way for the assessment of multi-genotypic HCV T-cell vaccines in humans. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Cholera is caused by toxigenic Vibrio cholerae. It is a significant health problem and an important cause of mortality of children in developing countries. Annually, about 5-7 million people are being infected worldwide, leading to death of 100,000 to 120,000. Immunization using the currently available cholera vaccines has been recommended by World Health Organization (WHO) in areas where cholera is endemic or at risk of outbreaks. Gram-negative bacteria secrete outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) that play important roles in virulence and host-pathogen interaction. The content of protein and lipid in OMVs are affected by purification methods and bacterial growth condition. OMVs released from V. cholerae are an appropriate candidate for vaccine development. The protection conferred by a new vaccine candidate prepared using different methods and in two different growth conditions with nanoparticles in an experimental model of cholera in mice was investigated. OMVs were encapsulated in chitosan-tripolyphosphate (TPP) nanoparticles prepared by an ionic gelation method and coated with Eudragit as an enteric polymer. OMVs loaded into nanoparticles (NP-OMVs) were homogeneous and spherical in shape, with a size of 417 nm. BALB/c mice (male, 20-24 g) were immunized via intraperitoneal (10 mu g) or oral route (50 mu g) with free or encapsulated OMVs. Seventy-eight days after first administration, serum of mice was infected with infection dose of V. cholerae (>= 10(7) CFU). The new vaccine was able to protect fully against infection when it was administered via mucosa. By intraperitoneal route, the unpolymerized OMVs increased the protection against these bacteria.

TI Diphtheria vaccine: WHO position paper, August 2017-Recommendations
SO VACCINE
LA English
DT Article
DE Diphtheria; Vaccines; Position paper; SAGE
AB This article presents the World Health Organization's (WHO) recommendations on the use of diphtheria vaccines excerpted from the Diphtheria vaccines: WHO position paper, August 2017, published in the Weekly Epidemiological Record (Diphtheria vaccine, 2017) [1]. This position paper replaces the 2006 WHO position paper on diphtheria vaccine (Diphtheria vaccine, 2006) [2].
   The position paper incorporates recent evidence on diphtheria and provides revised recommendations on the optimal number of doses and timing of diphtheria vaccination. In view of the widespread use of combination vaccines, it provides guidance on the alignment of vaccination schedules for different antigens included in routine childhood immunization programmes.
   Footnotes to this paper provide a number of core references including references to grading tables that assess the quality of the scientific evidence, and to the evidence-to-recommendation table. In accordance with its mandate to provide guidance to Member States on health policy matters, WHO issues a series of regularly updated position papers on vaccines and combinations of vaccines against diseases that have an international public health impact. These papers are concerned primarily with the use of vaccines in large-scale immunization programmes; they summarize essential background information on diseases and vaccines, and conclude with WHO's current position on the use of vaccines in the global context. Recommendations on the use of diphtheria vaccines were discussed by SAGE in April 2017; evidence presented at these meetings can be accessed at: www.whointfimmunization/sageimeetings/2017/april/presentations_background_docsien/.

AB Objectives: Health care providers (HCP) are at high risk of acquiring and transmitting pertussis to susceptible family members, co-workers, and patients. Public health authorities recommend administering a single dose of Tdap (tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis) vaccine to all adults, including HCP, to increase adult immunity to pertussis. We set a quality improvement goal to increase Tdap vaccination coverage among HCP who provided direct patient care at a children's hospital from 58% to 90% over 18 months.
   Design: A multidisciplinary working group comprised of Occupational Health Program (OHP) staff and representatives of various medical services drew from a variety of qualitative methods and previous studies of vaccination programs in the healthcare system to understand barriers to Tdap vaccination within the institution and to develop interventions to increase vaccination rates.
   Interventions: Interventions included changes to OHP processes, a general education campaign, improved access to vaccine, and personal engagement of HCP by task force members.
   Results: Overall vaccination rates increased to 90% over 15 months, a rate that has been sustained by systematically assessing new employees' vaccination status and vaccinating those without documentation of previous Tdap vaccination.
   Conclusions: Tdap vaccination coverage in our institution was significantly increased by an intensive, multipronged educational campaign, and by improving processes of screening and vaccination of HCP. The use of direct engagement of vaccine hesitant populations to increase vaccination rates warrants further study. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction: Duration of protection against pertussis is shorter in adolescents who have been immunized with acellular pertussis (aP) in infancy compared with adolescents who received whole-cell pertussis (wP) vaccines in infancy, which is related to immune responses elicited by these priming vaccines. To better understand differences in vaccine induced immunity, we determined pertussis, diphtheria, and tetanus (DTaP) vaccine antigen-specific IgG subclass responses in wP- and aP-primed children before and after two successive DTaP booster vaccinations.
   Methods: Blood samples were collected in a cross-sectional study from wP- or aP-primed children before and 1 month after the pre-school DTaP booster vaccination at age 4 years. Blood samples were collected from two different wP- and aP-primed groups of children before, 1 month and 1 year after an additional pre-adolescent Tdap booster at age 9 years. IgG subclass levels against the antigens included in the DTaP vaccine have been determined with fluorescent-bead-based multiplex immunoassays.
   Results: At 4 years of age, the IgG4 proportion and concentration for pertussis, diphtheria and tetanus vaccine antigens were significantly higher in aP-primed children compared with wP-primed children. IgG4 concentrations further increased upon the two successive booster vaccinations at 4 and 9 years of age in both wP- and aP-primed children, but remained significantly higher in aP-primed children.
   Conclusions: The pertussis vaccinations administered in the primary series at infancy determine the vaccine antigen-specific IgG subclass profiles, not only against the pertussis vaccine antigens, but also against the co-administered diphtheria and tetanus vaccine antigens. These profiles did not change after DTaP booster vaccinations later in childhood. The different immune response with high proportions of specific IgG4 in some aP-primed children may contribute to a reduced protection against pertussis.

AB The objective of the study was to compare responses of pigs vaccinated with a PRRS MLV vaccine against PRRSV-1 or PRRSV-2 with the responses of pigs vaccinated simultaneously with both vaccines. Furthermore, the efficacy of the two PRRSV MLV vaccination strategies was assessed following challenge. The experimental design included four groups of 4-weeks old SPF-pigs. On day 0 (DPV0), groups 1-3 (N = 18 per group) were vaccinated with modified live virus vaccines (MLV) containing PRRSV-1 virus (VAC-T1), PRRSV-2 virus (VAC-T2) or both (VAC-T1T2). One group was left unvaccinated (N = 12,). On DPV 62, the pigs from groups 1-4 were mingled in new groups and challenged (DPC 0) with PRRSV-1, subtype 1, PRRSV-1, subtype 2 or PRRSV-2. On DPC 13/14 all pigs were necropsied. Samples were collected after vaccination and challenge. PRRSV was detected in all vaccinated pigs and the majority of the pigs were positive until DPV 28, but few of the pigs were still viremic 62 days after vaccination. Virus was detected in nasal swabs until DPV 7-14. No overt clinical signs were observed after challenge. PRRSV-2 vaccination resulted in a clear reduction in viral load in serum after PRRSV-2 challenge, whereas there was limited effect on the viral load in serum following challenge with the PRRSV-1 strains. Vaccination against PRRSV-1 had less impact on viremia following challenge. The protective effects of simultaneous vaccination with PRRSV Type 1 and 2 MLV vaccines and single PRRS MLV vaccination were comparable. None of the vaccines decreased the viral load in the lungs at necropsy. In conclusion, simultaneous vaccination with MLV vaccines containing PRRSV-1 and PRRSV-2 elicited responses comparable to single vaccination and the commercial PRRSV vaccines protected only partially against challenge with heterologous strains. Thus, simultaneous administration of the two vaccines is an option in herds with both PRRSV types. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Measuring the cost of a pediatric vaccine administration in the UK
SO VACCINE
LA English
DT Article
DE Cost; Healthcare; Immunization; Vaccine administration; Time and motion
AB The administration of a vaccine dose involves a series of activities prior to and on the day of vaccine delivery. Total vaccination cost should include the cost of each activity, which is often not done or poorly reported.
   To calculate those costs a field study was performed in 6 United Kingdom (UK) sites (General Practitioner (GP) practices) during a 4-month period (April-June 2015). First, a workflow map of all the relevant vaccine-related activities per site was obtained through interviews. Second, time estimates for activities happening prior to the vaccination day were obtained through interviews and associated costs were calculated. A prospective, non-interventional study using Time & Motion (T&M) methodology was used to measure time for activities happening on the day of vaccination. Consumables, wastage, and guardian time were also collected. Third, the time for each task and for all tasks combined during the T&M study was analyzed using a random intercept model to account for site effect.
   Hundred and twenty-three T&M observations with approximately 20 per site were collected and were equally stratified by vaccination visit during the first year of a baby's life. Total cost per visit was 11.9 pound (site range: 8.6- pound 17.0) pound when supply cost and time for activities prior to the vaccination day were included. Time per dose administrated was 7.1 min (site range: 5.7-9.2) and the associated cost was 4.3 pound (site range: 3.1- pound 6.2) pound.
   The study demonstrates an accurate reflection of the time and cost involved in a vaccine dose administration in a pediatric setting in the UK. The amount measured is consistent with the current National Health Services fee schedule. (C) 2017 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Rotavirus is a highly contagious virus causing gastroenteritis, mostly in children under the age of 5. Since 2006, two vaccines are available in Germany. In 2013, these were included into the German national vaccination schedule. The aim of this intervention is to reduce the incidence and hospitalization among children under 5 years caused by rotavirus. The effectiveness of the intervention was analyzed in this study.
   Methods: National surveillance data of laboratory confirmed rotavirus infections among children under the age of 5 were analyzed using interrupted time-series analysis. Weekly incidence from 2011 to 2017 and monthly hospital discharge rates from 2005 to 2015 were analyzed using a segmented generalized linear model with Poisson distribution.
   Results: After adjusting for seasonal effects the incidence were approximately 22% (95% CI: 13.2-30.1) lower than expected following the intervention. The hospitalizations were approximately 27% (95% CI: 14.9-39.7) lower than expected following the intervention. The long-term effects of the intervention were nearly zero. The incidence changed in trend by -0.2% (95% CI: -0.1 to (-0.3)) and the hospitalizations by +0.2% (95% CI: 1.2-(-0.8)) following the intervention.
   Conclusion: After the inclusion of the vaccines into the national vaccination schedule significant immediate effects of this intervention were found. The weekly incidences and monthly hospitalization caused by the rotavirus were more than 20% lower than expected. The long-term effects of the intervention however were found to be nearly zero. This could be caused by a low vaccination rate in the German population. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Oral rotavirus vaccines have consistently proven to be less immunogenic among infants in developing countries. Discrepancies in the intestinal microbiota, including a greater burden of enteropathogens and an altered commensal community composition, may contribute to this trend by inhibiting the replication of vaccine viruses. To test this possibility, we performed a nested case-control study in Vellore, India, in which we compared the intestinal microbiota of infants who responded serologically or not after two doses of Rotarix delivered at 6 and 10 weeks of age as part of a clinical trial (CTRI/2012/05/002677). The prevalence of 40 bacterial, viral, and eukaryotic pathogen targets was assessed in pre-vaccination stool samples from 325 infants using singleplex real-time PCR on a Taqman array card (TAC). In a subset of 170 infants, we assessed bacterial microbiota composition by sequencing the 16S rRNA gene V4 region. Contrary to expectations, responders were more likely than non-responders to harbor >= 1 bacterial enteropathogen at dose I (26% [40/156] vs 13% [21/157] of infants with TAC results who completed the study per protocol; chi(2), P = .006), although this was not apparent at dose 2 (24% [38/158] vs 23% [36/158]; P = .790). Rotavirus shedding after dose 1 was negatively correlated with the replication of co-administered oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV). We observed no consistent differences in composition or diversity of the 16S bacterial microbiota according to serological response, although rotavirus shedding was associated with slightly more bacterial taxa pre-vaccination. Overall, our findings demonstrate an inhibitory effect of co-administered OPV on the first dose of Rotarix, consistent with previous studies, but in the context of OPV co-administration we did not find a strong association between other components of the intestinal microbiota at the time of vaccination and Rotarix immunogenicity.

AB Background: Strategies are needed to improve oral rotavirus vaccine (RV), which provides suboptimal protection in developing countries. Probiotics and zinc supplementation could improve RV immunogenicity by altering the intestinal microbiota and immune function.
   Methods: Infants 5 weeks old living in urban Vellore, India were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with a 4-arm factorial design to assess the effects of daily zinc (5 mg), probiotic (10(10) Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG) or placebo on the immunogenicity of two doses of RV (Rotarix (R), GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals) given at 6 and 10 weeks of age. Infants were eligible for participation if healthy, available for the study duration and without prior receipt of RV or oral poliovirus vaccine other than the birth dose. The primary outcome was seroconversion to rotavirus at 14 weeks of age based on detection of VP6-specific IgA at >= 20 U/ml in previously seronegative infants or a fourfold rise in concentration.
   Results: The study took place during July 2012 to February 2013. 620 infants were randomized equally between study arms and 551 (88.9%) completed per protocol. Seroconversion was recorded in 54/137 (39.4%), 42/136 (30.9%), 40/143 (28.0%), and 37/135 (27.4%) infants receiving (1) probiotic and zinc, (2) probiotic and placebo, (3) placebo and zinc, (4) two placebos. Seroconversion showed a modest improvement among infants receiving probiotic (difference between groups 1, 2 and 3, 4 was 7.5% (97.5% Confidence Interval (CI): -1.4%, 16.2%), p = 0.066) but not zinc (difference between groups 1, 3 and 2, 4 was 4.4% (97.5% CI: -4,4%, 13.2%), p = 0.272). 16 serious adverse events were recorded, none related to study interventions.
   Conclusions: Zinc or probiotic supplementation did not significantly improve the low immunogenicity of rotavirus vaccine given to infants in a poor urban community in India. A modest effect of combined supplementation deserves further investigation. (C) 2017 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Introduction: The Brazilian childhood National Immunization Program (NIP) introduced live and attenuated varicella vaccination in a single dose, combined as tetraviral vaccine, at 15 months of age in the whole country, during September to December of 2013. The aim of this study was to report trends in incidence of childhood hospital admissions related to varicella and zoster in Brazil from 2003 to 2016, including the first three years after vaccine introduction.
   Methods: The number and incidence of hospital admission in patients aged less than 20 years in Brazilian public health system with an admission diagnosis of varicella and zoster from 2003 to 2016 were analyzed and pre (2003-2013) and post-vaccination periods (2014-2016) were compared. The data were obtained from DATASUS, a Brazilian government's open-access public health database system, and analyzed adjusting for secular trend and seasonality if a statistically significant change was found.
   Results: During the study period, 69,791 admissions due to varicella and herpes zoster occurred in the children younger than 20 years. After adjusting for seasonality, the incidence of hospitalizations decreased from 27.33 to 14.33 per 100000 per year, which corresponds to a reduction of 47.6% (95% confidence interval 18.19-77.04%, p < 0.001) in the vaccinated age group (1-4 years) in 2014-2016 compared to pre-vaccination period. The changes were not significant in the unvaccinated age groups.
   Conclusion: The hospitalizations due to varicella and herpes zoster were decreased by half early after the introduction of a single dose of tetraviral vaccine in NIP in the vaccinated children. Further studies may assess duration and intensity of this effect, as well as the indirect effect in the unvaccinated age groups. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Rabies DNA vaccines based on full-length glycoprotein (G) induce virus neutralizing antibody (VNA) responses and protect against the virus challenge. Although conformational epitopes of G are the main target of VNAs, some studies have shown that a polypeptide linear epitope G5 is also able to induce VNAs. However, a G5 DNA vaccine has not been explored. While multiple doses of DNA vaccines are required in order to confer a protective immune response, this could be overcome by the inclusion of C3d-P28, a molecular adjuvant is know to improve the antibody response in several anti-viral vaccine models. To induce and enhance the immune response against rabies in mice, we evaluated two DNA vaccines based on the linear epitope G5 of Rabies Virus (RABV) glycoprotein (pVaxG5 vaccine) and another vaccine consisting of G5 fused to the molecular adjuvant C3d-P28 (pVaxF1 vaccine). VNA responses were measured in mice immunized with both vaccines. The VNA levels from the group immunized with pVaxG5 decreased gradually, while those from the group vaccinated with pVaxF1 remained high throughout the experimental study. After challenge with 22 LD50 of the Challenge Virus Strain (CVS), the survival rate of mice immunized with pVaxG5 and pVaxF1 was increased by 27% and 50% respectively, in comparison to the PBS group. Furthermore, the in vitro proliferation of anti-rabies specific spleen CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from mice immunized with pVaxF1 was observed. Collectively, these results suggest that the linear G5 epitope is a potential candidate vaccine. Furthermore, the addition of a C3d-P28 adjuvant contributed to enhanced protection, the sustained production of VNAs, and a specific T-cell proliferative response. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Clusters of anxiety-related adverse events following immunization (AEFI) have been observed in several countries and have disrupted country immunization programs. We conducted a systematic literature review to characterize these clusters, to generate prevention and management guidance for countries.
   Methods: We searched seven peer-reviewed databases for English language reports of anxiety-related AEFI clusters (>= 2 persons) with pre-specified keywords across 4 categories: symptom term, cluster term, vaccine term, and cluster AEFI phenomenon term/phrase. All relevant reports were included regardless of publication date, case-patient age, or vaccine. Two investigators independently reviewed abstracts and identified articles for full review. Data on epidemiologic/clinical information were extracted from full text review including setting, vaccine implicated, predominant case-patient symptoms, clinical management, community and media response, and outcome/impact on the vaccination program.
   Results: Of 1472 abstracts reviewed, we identified eight published clusters, from all six World Health Organization (WHO) regions except the African Region. Seven clusters occurred among children in school settings, and one was among adult military reservists. The size and nature of these clusters ranged from 7 patients in one school to 806 patients in multiple schools. Patients' symptoms included dizziness, headache, and fainting with rapid onset after vaccination. Implicated vaccines included tetanus (2), tetanus diphtheria (1), hepatitis B (1), oral cholera (1), human papillomavirus (1), and influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 (2). In each report, all affected individuals recovered rapidly; however, vaccination program disruption was noted in some instances, sometimes for up to one year.
   Conclusions: Anxiety-related AEFI clusters can be disruptive to vaccination programs, reducing public trust in immunizations and impacting vaccination coverage; response efforts to restore public confidence can be resource intensive. Health care providers should have training on recognition and clinical management of anxiety-related AEFI; public health authorities should have plans to prevent and effectively manage anxiety-related AEFI clusters. Prompt management of these occurrences can be even more important in an era of social media, in which information is rapidly spread. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Highly pathogenic avian influenza A (HPAI) viruses found in poultry and wild birds occasionally infect humans and can cause serious disease. In 2014, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) reviewed data from one licensed AS03-adjuvanted influenza A(H5N1) vaccine for consideration of use during inter-pandemic periods among persons with occupational exposure. To guide vaccine policy decisions, we conducted a survey of laboratory workers to assess demand for HPAI vaccination.
   Methods: We designed an anonymous web survey (Epilnfo 7.0) to collect information on demographics, type of work and time spent with HPAI viruses, and interest in HPAI vaccination. Eligible participants were identified from 42 entities registered with United States Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Select Agent program in 2016 and emailed electronic surveys. Personnel with Biosafety Level 3 enhanced (BSL-3E) laboratory access were surveyed. Descriptive analysis was performed.
   Results: Overall, 131 responses were received from 33 principal investigators, 26 research scientists, 24 technicians, 15 postdoctoral fellows, 6 students, and 27 others. The estimated response rate was 15% among the laboratory personnel of responding principal investigators. One hundred respondents reported working in a BSL-3E area where HPAI experiments occurred with a mean time of 5.1-11.7 h per week. Overall, 49% were interested in receiving an A(H5N1) vaccine. By role, interest was highest among students (80%) and among those who spent >50% of their time in a BSL-3E area (64%). Most (61%) of those who said they might be or were not interested in vaccine believed it would not provide additional protection to current safety practices.
   Conclusions: Half of responding laboratory workers was interested in receiving an influenza A(H5N1) vaccine. HPAI vaccination of laboratory workers at risk of occupational exposure could be used along with existing safety practices to protect this population. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

When teenagers enter college, there may be a shift in healthcare decision-making from parents and guardians to the students themselves. Little is known about factors influencing college students' healthcare decision-making processes.
   Study design: We evaluated HPV vaccine decision-making among 18-to-26-year-old college students through a self-administered, anonymous, cross-sectional survey. This survey was distributed to a sample of men and women in classroom settings at two universities. Categorical data comparisons were conducted using Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests. Multivariate Poisson regression was used to model initiation of HPV vaccine and compute prevalence ratios while controlling for key influential covariates at the 0.05 alpha level.
   Results: A total of 527 students participated (response proportion = 93.1%). Overall, 55.8% of participants received the HPV vaccine. Encouraging conversations with doctors and/or parents/guardians were identified as one of the most influential factors to increase vaccine uptake. Among students who received encouragement from both a doctor and parent, 95.8% received,the vaccine. Campaigns about cancer prevention were viewed as more influential than those that focus on preventing genital warts. Approximately one-third of students indicated they didn't know where to get the HPV vaccine. Women were more likely to report that their parents would not let them get the HPV vaccine compared to men (26.7% vs. 2.3%). The majority of students (77.3%) indicated their parents were sometimes, equally, or mostly involved in making decisions about receiving vaccines (other than flu).
   Conclusion: Students' decision-making is greatly influenced by their parents; therefore, interventions for this population should work to increase students' control over decision-making while also addressing parental concerns. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Saponin-based adjuvants are promising adjuvants that enhance both humoral and T-cell-mediated immunity. One of the most used natural products as vaccine adjuvants are Quillaja saponaria bark saponins and its fraction named Quil A (R). Despite that, its use has been restricted for human use due to safety issues. As an alternative, our group has been studying the congener species Quillaja brasiliensis saponins and its performance as vaccine adjuvants, which have shown to trigger humoral and cellular immune responses comparable to Quil A (R) but with milder side effects. Here, we studied a semi purified aqueous extract (AE) and a previously little characterized saponin-enriched fraction (QB-80) from Q brasiliensis as vaccine adjuvants and an inactivated virus (bovine viral diarrhea virus, BVDV) antigen co-formulated in experimental vaccines in mice model. For the first time, we show the spectra pattern of the Q, brasiliensis saponins by MALDI-TOF, a novel and cost-effective method that could be used to characterize different batches during saponins production. Both AE and QB-80 exhibited noteworthy chemical similarities to Quil A. In addition, the haemolytic activity and toxicity were assessed, showing that both AE and QB-80 were less toxic than Quil A. When subcutaneously inoculated in mice, both fractions promoted long-term strong antibody responses encompassing specific IgG1 and IgG2a, enhanced the avidity of IgG antibodies, induced a robust DTH reaction and significantly increased IFN-gamma production in T CD4(+) and T CD8(+) cells. Furthermore, we have proven herein that AE has the potential to promote dose sparing, substantially reducing the dose of antigen required for the BVDV vaccines and still eliciting a mixed Thl/Th2 strong immune response. Based on these results, and considering that AE is a raw extract, easier and cheaper to produce than commercially available saponins, this product can be considered as candidate to be escalated from experimental to industrial uses.

AB Background: In recent years, hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection has declined considerably in China, associated with wide deployment of HAV vaccines and improvement in socio-economic indicators. Towards the elimination of HA in the country, we assessed the duration and characteristics of immunity conferred by the widely used, locally manufactured HAV vaccine.
   Methods: This is a longitudinal cohort study that followed recipients of a live attenuated HAV vaccine 17 years after the initial administration. Blood samples were collected from participants pre- and two-week post-booster HAV vaccine dose. Serum anti-HAV antibody was measured by ELISA method. Memory B and T cells were determined by ELISPOT and Flow Cytometry assays, respectively.
   Results: A robust anamnestic response was observed two-week post-challenge. Both HAV-specific memory B cell and T cells remained, and responded quickly when re-encountering HAV. The magnitude of recall responses was present, regardless of the status of the serum anti-HAV antibody pre-booster.
   Conclusions: We demonstrated long-term immunity from the live attenuated HAV vaccine, including antibody persistence and immunological memory. Considering the conditions that make elimination of infectious diseases feasible, following polio, hepatitis A could be targeted for elimination in China. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, particularly in young children and older adults. Influenza is known to cause severe disease but the risk of developing LRTI following influenza virus infection in various populations has not been systematically reviewed. Such data are important for estimating the impact specific influenza vaccine programs would have on LRTI outcomes in a community. We sought to review the published literature to determine the risk of developing LRTI following an influenza virus infection in individuals of any age.
   Methods and findings: We conducted a systematic review to identify prospective studies that estimated the incidence of LRTI following laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infection. We searched PubMed, Medline, and Embase databases for relevant literature. We supplemented this search with a narrative review of influenza and LRTI. The systematic review identified two prospective studies that both followed children less than 5 years. We also identified one additional pediatric study from our narrative review meeting the study inclusion criteria. Finally, we summarized recent case-control studies on the etiology of pneumonia in both adults and children.
   Conclusions: There is a dearth of prospective studies evaluating the risk of developing LRTI following influenza virus infection. Determining the burden of severe LRTI that is attributable to influenza is necessary to estimate the benefits of influenza vaccine on this important public health outcome. Vaccine probe studies are an efficient way to evaluate these questions and should be encouraged going forward. (C) 2017 World Health Organization. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB A beta-1,3-D-glucan called Schizophyllan (SPG) can form a novel complex with homo oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) via the combination of hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions. Dectin-1 is a major receptor involved in the recognition of beta-1,3-D-glucans and expressed on antigen presenting cells (APCs) including macrophages, dendritic cells, monocytes, neutrophils, and a subset of T cells. Therefore, the SPG/ODN complex can be used as APCs cell-specific delivery of functional ODNs including unmethylated CpG sequences (CpG-ODNs). In fact, CpG-ODN/SPG complex induced high antibody titers when it was administered to cynomolgus monkeys as adjutant of influenza vaccine. These results indicate that SPG can be an excellent immunocyte-targeting drug delivery system. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In 2016, the Immunization Technical Advisory Group of the South-East Asia Region (SEAR) endorsed a regional goal to achieve <= 1% prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) among 5-year-old children by 2020. Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is largely preventable with a birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine (HepB-BD) followed by two to three additional doses. We reviewed the progress towards hepatitis B control through vaccination in SEAR during 1992-2015. We summarized hepatitis B vaccination data and reviewed the literature to determine the prevalence of chronic HBV infection pre- and post-vaccine introduction. We used a mathematical model to determine post-vaccine prevalence of HBsAg among 5 year olds in countries lacking national serosurvey data and estimated the impact of vaccination on disease burden. Regional coverage with three doses of hepatitis B vaccine (HepB3) increased from 56% in 2011 to 87% in 2015. By 2016, 7 of 11 countries had introduced universal HepB-BD. Regional HepB-BD coverage increased from 9% in 2011 to 34% in 2015. In 2015, estimated HBsAg among 5 year olds was 1.1% with variability among countries. Myanmar (3.8%), Timor-Leste (2.7%), Indonesia (1.8%), and India (1%) had the highest prevalence of HBsAg. During 1992-2015, vaccination prevented approximately 16 million chronic HBV infections and 2.6 million related deaths. In 2015, around 197,640 perinatal HBV infections occurred in SEAR with majority occurring in India (62%), Bangladesh (24%), and Myanmar (8%). Myanmar had the highest rate of perinatal chronic HBV infections at 16 per 1000 live births. Despite significant progress in the control of HBV, SEAR needs to secure political commitment for elimination and consider additional strategies, such as promoting health facility births, universal birth dose administration, developing strong coordination between health sectors, and using alternative vaccine delivery methods, to improve HepB-BD coverage and subsequently achieve HBV control and elimination.

AB Background: In Belgium, the infant pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) programme changed from PCV7 (2007-2011) to PCV13 (2011-2015) and to PCV10 (2015-2016). A 3-year nasopharyngeal carriage study was initiated during the programme switch in 2016. Main objective of the year 1 assessment was to obtain a baseline measurement of pneumococcal carriage prevalence, carriage density, serotype distribution and antibiotic resistance.
   Materials/methods: Two infant populations aged 6-30 months and without use of antibiotics in the seven days prior to sampling were approached: (1) attending one of 85 randomly selected day-care centres (DCC); (2) presenting with AOM at study-trained general practitioners and paediatricians. Demographic and clinical characteristics were documented and a single nasopharyngeal swab was taken. S. pneumoniae were cultured, screened for antibiotic resistance and serotyped, and quantitative Taqman real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) targeting LytA was performed.
   Results: Culture-based (DCC: 462/760; 60.8%- AOM: 27/39; 69.2%) and LytA-based (DCC: 603/753; 80.1% - AOM: 32/39; 82.1%) carriage prevalence was high. Average pneumococcal DNA load in LytA-positive day-care samples was 6.5 x 10(6) copies/mu l (95%Cl = 3.9-9.2 x 10(6), median = 3.5 x 10(5)); DNA load was positively associated with signs of common cold and negatively with previous antibiotic use. Culture based frequency of 13 pneumococcal vaccine (PCV) serotypes was 5.4% in DCC and 7.7% in AOM, with 19F and 14 being most frequent, and frequencies below 0.5% for serotypes 3, 6A, 19A in both populations. Predominant non-PCV serotypes were 23B and 23A in day-care and 11A in infants with AOM. In day-care, resistance to penicillin was rare (<0.5%) and absent against levofloxacin; 32.7% and 16.9% isolates were cotrimoxazole- and erythromycin-resistant respectively.
   Conclusion: Four years after PCV13 introduction in the vaccination programme, PCV13 serotype carriage was rare in infants throughout Belgium and penicillin resistance was rare. Continued surveillance in the context of a PCV programme switch is necessary. (C) 2017 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Objectives: The widespread availability and use of vaccines have tremendously reduced morbidity, mortality and health care costs associated with infectious diseases. However, parental beliefs about vaccination are one of the major factors in achieving high vaccination rates. Thus, this study aims to assess the perceptions and attitudes regarding routine childhood immunization among Saudi parents.
   Methods: A cross sectional study with a pre-tested 18-item questionnaire was conducted using 467 randomly selected parents from the Hail region of Saudi Arabia in the period between February 1st, 2016, and February 1st, 2017. The validated questionnaire consisted of three sections that collected information on participants' demographics, parents' awareness of vaccine benefits, and parents' practices regarding the immunization of their children.
   Results: Female and male parents comprised 54.5% (255) and 45.5% (212) of the sample, respectively, and the response and completion rates were 97%. The majority of the respondents had received a formal education (94.1%, 439), were gainfully employed (62.9%, 294) and had a regular monthly income (73.3%). The majority of the respondents were aware of childhood vaccinations (78.9%), completed vaccinations mandated for children up to 5 years (86.2%), encouraged other parents to do so (89.9%), and had easy acces to vaccines (90.5%). Sixty to ninety percent of the respondents were knowledgeable regarding the health benefits of vaccinations in children, even though 18.4% of their children had experienced vaccination related minor adverse effects during or after vaccination of which 23.2% required doctor's visits. Health care professionals were the most frequent source of parents' vaccine-related information (65.2%), and vaccination reminder services provided by the Ministry of Health (MOH) via mobile phones were cited by 57.5% of respondents.
   Conclusions: Confidence in and acceptance of childhood vaccinations, perceptions of vaccine-related health benefits and ease of access to immunizations appeared to be quite good among Saudi parents. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: Several outbreaks of serogroup B meningococcal disease have occurred among university students in recent years. In the setting of high coverage of the quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine and prior to widespread use of serogroup B meningococcal vaccines among adolescents, we conducted surveys to characterize the prevalence and molecular characteristics of meningococcal carriage among university students.
   Methods: Two cross-sectional oropharyngeal carriage surveys were conducted among undergraduates at a Rhode Island university. Isolates were characterized using slide agglutination, real-time polymerase chain reaction (rt-PCR), and whole genome sequencing. Adjusted prevalence ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using Poisson regression to determine risk factors for carriage.
   Results: A total of 1837 oropharyngeal specimens were obtained from 1478 unique participants. Overall carriage prevalence was 12.7-14.6% during the two survey rounds, with 1.8-2.6% for capsular genotype B, 0.9-1.0% for capsular genotypes C, W, or Y, and 9.9-10.8% for nongroupable strains by rt-PCR. Meningococcal carriage was associated with being male, smoking, party or club attendance, recent antibiotic use (inverse correlation), and recent respiratory infections.
   Conclusions: In this university setting, the majority of meningococcal carriage was due to nongroupable strains, followed by serogroup B. Further evaluation is needed to understand the dynamics of serogroup B carriage and disease among university students. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: India is responsible for 30% of the annual global cohort of unvaccinated children worldwide. Private practitioners provide an estimated 21% of vaccinations in urban centers of India, and are important partners in achieving high vaccination coverage.
   Methods: We used an in-person questionnaire and on-site observation to assess knowledge, attitudes, and practices of private immunization service providers regarding delivery of immunization services in the urban settings of Surat and Baroda, in Gujarat, India. We constructed a comprehensive sampling frame of all private physician providers of immunization services in Surat and Baroda cities, by consulting vaccine distributors, local branches of physician associations, and published lists of private medical practitioners. All providers were contacted and asked to participate in the study if they provided immunization services. Data were collected using an in-person structured questionnaire and directly observing practices; one provider in each practice setting was interviewed.
   Results: The response rate was 82% (121/147) in Surat, and 91% (137/151) in Baroda. Of 258 participants 195 (76%) were pediatricians, and 63 (24%) were general practitioners. Practices that were potential missed opportunities for vaccination (MOV) included not strictly following vaccination schedules if there were concerns about ability to pay (45% of practitioners), and not administering more than two injections in the same visit (60%). Only 22% of respondents used a vaccination register to record vaccine doses, and 31% reported vaccine doses administered to the government. Of 237 randomly selected vaccine vials, 18% had expired vaccine vial monitors.
   Conclusions: Quality of immunization services in Gujarat can be strengthened by providing training and support to private immunization service providers to reduce MOVs and improve quality and safety; other more context specific strategies that should be evaluated may involve giving feedback to providers on quality of services delivered and working through professional societies to adopt standards of practice.

AB Background: In this study, we examined the effectiveness of RV1 and RV5 vaccines during an outbreak of G8P[8] rotavirus group A strain (G8P[8]-RVA). These vaccines were originally designed to provide protection against severe diseases caused by common circulating strains, whereas G8P[81-RVA remains emerging strain and partially heterotypic to the vaccines. It is imperative to investigate vaccine effectiveness (VE) against G8P[8]-RVA because this strain appears to be predominant in recent years, particularly, in post-vaccine era.
   Methods: RVA infection and genotypes were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by sequence-based genotyping. VE was determined during an outbreak of G8P[8]-RVA in Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan, in February-July 2017, retrospectively, by comparing vaccination status of children suffering from acute gastroenteritis (AGE) between 'PCR-positive' and 'PCR-negative' cases using conditional logistic regression adjusted for age.
   Results: Among 80 AGE children, RVA was detected in 58 (73%), of which 53 (66%) was G8P[81-RVA. The clinical characteristics of G8P[8]-RVA and other RVA strains were identically severe. Notably, the attack rates of G8P[8]-RVA in vaccinated (61.1%) and unvaccinated (65.5%) children were almost similar. Indeed, no substantial effectiveness were found against G8P[8]-RVA (VE, 14% [95% CI: 140% to 70%]) or other RVA strains (VE, 58% [95% CI: 20% to 90%]) for mild infections. However, these vaccines remained strongly effective against moderate (VE, 75% [95% CI: 1% to 40%]) and severe (VE, 92% [95% CI: 60% to 98%]) RVA infections. The disease severity including Vesikari score, duration and frequency of diarrhea, and body temperature were significantly lower in vaccinated children.
   Conclusions: This study demonstrates the effectiveness of current RV vaccines against moderate and severe, but not against the mild infections during an outbreak caused by unusual G8P[8]-RVA, which was virtually not targeted in the vaccines. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   Objective: We characterized adverse events (AEs) after hepatitis B vaccination of pregnant women reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), a spontaneous reporting surveillance system.
   Methods: We searched VAERS for AEs reports involving pregnant women who received hepatitis B vaccine from January 1, 1990-June 30, 2016. All reports and available medical records were reviewed by physicians. Observed AEs were compared to expected AEs and known rates of pregnancy outcomes to assess for any unexpected safety concern.
   Results: We found 192 reports involving pregnant women following hepatitis B vaccination of which 110 (57.3%) described AEs; 12 (6.3%) were classified as serious; one newborn death was identified in a severely premature delivery, and there were no maternal deaths. Eighty-two (42.7%) reports did not describe any AEs. Among pregnancies for which gestational age was reported, most women were vaccinated during the first trimester, 86/115 (74.7%). Among reports describing an AE, the most common pregnancy-specific outcomes included spontaneous abortion in 23 reports, preterm delivery in 7 reports, and elective termination in 5 reports. The most common non-pregnancy specific outcomes were general disorders and administration site conditions, such as injection site and systemic reactions, in 21 reports. Among 22 reports describing an AE among infants born to women vaccinated during pregnancy, 5 described major birth defects each affecting different organ systems.
   Conclusion: Our analysis of VAERS reports involving hepatitis B vaccination during pregnancy did not identify any new or unexpected safety concerns. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Modified-live virus (MLV) vaccines are widely used to protect pigs against porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). However, current MLV vaccines do not confer adequate levels of heterologous protection, presumably due to the substantial genetic diversity of PRRSV isolates circulating in the field. To overcome this genetic variation challenge, we recently generated a synthetic PRRSV strain containing a consensus genomic sequence of PRRSV-2. We demonstrated that our synthetic PRRSV strain confers unprecedented levels of heterologous protection. However, the synthetic PRRSV strain at passage 1 (hereafter designated CON-P1) is highly virulent and therefore, is not suitable to be used as a vaccine in pigs. In the present study, we attenuated CON-P1 by continuously passaging the virus in MARC-145 cells, a non-natural host cell line. Using a young pig model, we demonstrated that the synthetic virus at passages 90 and 122 (designated as CON-P90 and CON-P122, respectively) were fully attenuated, as evidenced by the significantly reduced viral loads in serum and tissues and the absence of lung lesion in the infected pigs. Most importantly, CON-P90 confers similar levels of heterologous protection as its parental strain CON-P1. Taken together, the results indicate that CON-P90 is an excellent candidate for the formulation of next generation of PRRSV MLV vaccines with improved levels. of heterologous protection.

AB Caseous lymphadenitis (CIA) is a chronic disease responsible for significant economic losses in sheep and goat breeding worldwide. The treatment for this disease is not effective, and an intense vaccination schedule would be the best control strategy. In this study, we evaluated the associations of rCP09720 or rCP01850 proteins from Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis with recombinant exotoxin phospholipase D (rPLD) as subunit vaccines in mice. Four experimental groups (10 animals each) were immunized with a sterile 0.9% saline solution (G1), rPLD (G2), rPLD + rCP09720 (G3), and rPLD + rCP01850 (G4). The mice received two doses of each vaccine at a 21-day interval and were challenged 21 days after the last immunization. The animals were evaluated daily for 40 days after the challenge, and mortality rate was recorded. The total IgG production level increased significantly in the experimental groups on day 42 after the first vaccination. Similarly, higher levels of specific IgG2a were observed in experimental groups G2, G3, and G4 compared to the IgG1 levels on day 42. G4 showed a significant (p < .05) humoral response against both antigens of the antigenic formulations. The cellular immune response induced by immunization was characterized by a significant (p < .05) production of interferon-gamma compared to that in the control, while the concentrations of interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-12 were not significant in any group. A significant increase of tumor necrosis factor was observed only in G4. The survival rates after the challenge were 30% (rPLD), 40% (rPLD + rCP09720), and 50% (rPLD + rCP01850). Thus, the association of rCP01850 with rPLD resulted in the best protection against the challenge with C pseudotuberculosis and induced a more intense type 1 T-helper cell immune response.

AB The outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus in North American poultry during 2014 and 2015 demonstrated the devastating effects of the disease and highlighted the need for effective emergency vaccine prevention and control strategies targeted at currently circulating strains. This study evaluated the efficacy of experimental recombinant turkey herpesvirus vector vaccines with three different inserts targeting the hemagglutinin gene of an isolate from the recent North American influenza outbreak. White leghorn chickens were vaccinated at one day of age and challenged with A/Turkey/Minnesota/12582/2015 H5N2 at 4 weeks of age. Birds were analyzed for survival, viral shedding at two and four days after infection, and specific antibody prior to challenge and from surviving birds. The three experimental vaccines demonstrated 100%, 45% and 15% survival with the most effective vaccine significantly reducing oral and cloacal viral shedding compared to all other groups and generated specific antibody prior to challenge with highly pathogenic avian influenza virus. More studies are needed using diverse H5Nx highly pathogenic virus isolates to fully determine the breadth of coverage against possible exposure strains, as well as possible impact of maternally derived antibody on protection and vaccine efficacy.

AB Background: Influenza infection is a contagious disease and annual influenza vaccination is recommended to the patients with chronic diseases. Although diabetes is an indication for influenza vaccination, the global rate of influenza vaccination is insufficient. Therefore, our study aimed to elucidate influenza vaccination statuses among patients with diabetes and the related factors in Korea.
   Methods: A total of 32,268 subjects (4,540 with and 27,728 without diabetes) from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III-VI (2005-2015) were included. Socioeconomic factors and health-related factors were analyses for the relation of influenza vaccination by Student's t-test, the chi-squared test and a multivariate logistic regression analysis.
   Results: The influenza vaccination coverage rates were 50.0% in the diabetes mellitus (DM) group and 38.2% in the non-DM group. The trends in influenza vaccination rates during KNHANES III-VI were not significant in each group (P trend = 0.24 in the DM group, 0.30 in the non-DM group). Socioeconomic (older age, female sex, higher family income, and medical aid insurance) and health-related factors (lack of risky alcohol consumption, obesity, and recent health check-ups) were associated with influenza vaccination among patients with DM.
   Conclusions: The rate of influenza vaccination among patients with diabetes is insufficient in Korea. More efforts are needed to increase the influenza vaccination rates among vulnerable at-risk populations. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This observer-blind study (clinicaltrials.gov NCT01462357) compared the immunogenicity and safety of two doses (2D) of the HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine (2D of AS04-HPV-16/18) vs. two or three doses of the 4vHPV vaccine [2D or 3D of 4vHPV] in 1075 healthy girls aged 9-14 years. Girls were randomized (1:1:1) to receive 2D of AS04-HPV-16/18 at months (M) 0, 6 (N = 359), 2D of 4vHPV at MO, 6 (N = 358) or 3D of 4vHPV at MO, 2, 6 (N = 358). 351, 339 and 346 girls, respectively, returned for the concluding visit at M36. Superiority was demonstrated at M7 and M12; comparison of the immune response to both vaccine antigens was made between 2D of AS04-HPV-16/18 and 2D or 3D of 4vHPV at subsequent time points in the according-to-protocol immunogenicity cohort (ATP-I; N = 958 at M36) and the total vaccinated cohort (TVC: N = 1036 at M36). HPV-16/18-specific T-cell- and B-cell-mediated immune responses and safety were also investigated. At M36, anti-HPV-16/18 ELISA responses in the 2D AS04-HPV-16/18 group remained superior to those of the 2D and 3D 4vHPV groups. In the M36 TVC, geometric mean titers were 2.78-fold (HPV-16) and 6.84-fold (HPV-18) higher for 2D of AS04-HPV-16/18 vs. 2D of 4vHPV and 2.3-fold (HPV-16) and 4.14-fold (HPV-18) higher vs. 3D of 4vHPV. Results were confirmed by vaccine pseudovirion-based neutralisation assay. Numbers of circulating CD4(+) T cells and B cells appeared similar across groups. Safety was in line with the known safety profiles of both vaccines. In conclusion, superior HPV-16/18 antibody responses were elicited by 2D of the AS04-HPV-16/18 compared with 2D or 3D of the 4vHPV vaccine in girls aged 9-14 years. (C) 2017 GlaxoSmithKline SA.

AB Epidemiological indicators have shown the substantial impact of influenza B (Flu B) on the development of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) and on mortality rates. In Brazil, the trivalent vaccine, composed of only one Flu B lineage is available. We investigated Flu B infections in clinical samples collected by the epidemiological surveillance service of Parana State, Brazil, from 2013 to 2016. The Flu B lineages Yamagata- (B/Yam) and Victoria-like (B/Vic) were identified using the qRT-PCR assay, and notification forms were reviewed. Among 379 Flu B positive samples evaluated, 370 (98%) were characterized as B/Yam or B/Vic lineages. Both co-circulated with a frequency of 47% and 53%, respectively. B/Yam infected equally both genders, while B/Vic was more frequent in females (71%). The median age of patients infected by B/Vic (23y; 11-35) was lower than that of patients infected by B/Yam (32y; 12-50). Mismatch between the vaccine and the circulating strain was observed in the 2013 season, with a high number of SARI cases. B/Vic lineage was associated with a larger number of SARI cases (62%), while B/Yam with influenza-like illness (ILI) (61%). Differences were observed in the strains circulating in separate regions of Parana State. B/Vic was prevalent in the northwestern (67%) and B/Yam in the southeastern region (60%). The unpredictability of Flu B lineage circulation causes a substantial increase in severe disease during epidemics in a vaccine mismatch season. In addition, the differences in the epidemiological profile of the target population of Flu B infections in relation to other respiratory viruses, as well as among the B/Vic and B/Yam lineages may also be associated to an increase in disease burden. These findings have direct consequences on vaccination strategies. Therefore, further molecular epidemiology studies of Flu B in Brazil are required to corroborate these primary results.

AB Objectives: HPV vaccination at the recommended ages of 11-12 is highly effective yet has stalled well below the goal of 80% of the population. We evaluated a statewide practice-based communication intervention (tools: brochures, posters, online training for providers and resources for parents, video game for preteens) to persuade parents, preteens and providers to vaccinate against HPV. The 9-month intervention started May 1, 2015.
   Methods: We compared vaccine initiation and completion rates over three 9-month periods (baseline, intervention, post-intervention) between practices enrolled in the intervention and a comparable comparison group. All practices reported to the North Carolina Immunization Registry (NOR) and had at least 100 11- and 12-year-olds who had not completed the HPV vaccine series. Of 175 eligible practices, the 14 intervention practices included 19,398 individuals and the 161 comparison practices included 127,896 individuals. An extended Cox model was used to test the intervention effect.
   Results: The intervention had a significant effect on both initiation and completion during the intervention and post-intervention periods; the estimated hazard ratio (HR) for initiation was 1.17 (p=.004) during the intervention and 1.11 (p=.005) post-intervention. Likewise, completion during the intervention period was 17% higher in intervention practices, after controlling for baseline differences. This effect increased in the post-intervention period to 30% higher (p=.03).
   Conclusions: Individuals in the intervention practices were 17% more likely to initiate and complete HPV vaccination than in the comparison practices during the intervention period and the effect was sustained post-intervention. This intervention is promising for increasing rates of HPV vaccination at ages 11-12. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Cool water packs are a useful alternative to ice packs for preventing unintentional freezing of vaccines during outreach in some situations. Current guidelines recommend the use of a separate refrigerator for cooling water packs from ambient temperatures to prevent possible heat degradation of adjacent vaccine vials. To investigate whether this additional equipment is necessary, we measured the temperatures that vaccine vials were exposed to when warm water packs were placed next to vials in a refrigerator. We then calculated the effect of repeated vial exposure to those temperatures on vaccine vial monitor status to estimate the impact to the vaccine. Vials were tested in a variety of configurations, varying the number and locations of vials and water packs in the refrigerator. The calculated average percentage life lost during a month. of repeated warming, ranged from 20.0% to 30.3% for a category 2 (least stable) vaccine vial monitor and from 3.8% to 6.0% for a category 7 (moderate stability) vaccine vial monitor, compared to 17.0% for category 2 vaccine vial monitors and 3.1% for category 7 vaccine vial monitors at a constant 5 degrees C, The number of vials, number of water packs, and locations of each impacted vial warming and therefore percentage life lost, but the vaccine vial monitor category had a higher impact on the average percentage life lost than any of the other parameters. The results suggest that damage to vaccines from repeated warming over the course of a month is not certain and that cooling water packs in a refrigerator where vaccines are being stored may be a useful practice if safe procedures are established.

AB Background: Emerging evidence suggests that HPV infection is associated with negative pregnancy outcomes such as preterm birth (PTB), and pre-eclampsia, We aimed to determine if prior HPV vaccination reduced adverse pregnancy outcomes.
   Methods: A New Zealand population-based retrospective study linking first pregnancy outcome data (2008-2014 n = 35,646) with prior quadrivalent HPV vaccination status. Primary outcomes were likelihood (odds ratios, ORs) of PTB, pre-eclampsia, and stillbirth. Exposure groups were based on HPV vaccination. Adjusted ORs were calculated for each outcome, controlling for mother's age at delivery, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, health board region at time of delivery, and body mass index and smoking status at time of registration with maternity care provider.
   Results: Mother's mean age at delivery was 19 (SD 2.1) years. Of 34,994 the pregnancies included in the final study analyses 62.3% of women were unvaccinated, 11.0% vaccinated with one or two doses and 27.7% vaccinated with three doses prior to pregnancy. PTB (OR: 0.87; CI 0.78, 0.96)) was significantly lower for women who previously received the HPV vaccine. A dose response effect was found with each successive dose received decreasing the likelihood of PTB. No associations between the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups were shown for pre-eclampsia or stillbirth.
   Conclusions: Prior receipt of the quadrivalent HPV vaccine was associated with a significant reduction in PTB (13%); suggesting that HPV vaccination may be effective in reducing PTB. The potential global public health impact is considerable and there is urgency to undertake further research to replicate and explore these findings. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: In phase III trials, 2 doses of a herpes zoster (HZ) subunit vaccine (HZ/su; 50 mu g varicellazoster virus glycoprotein E [gE] and ASO1(B) Adjuvant System) administered 2-months apart in older adults (>= 50 and >= 70 years) demonstrated >90% efficacy in preventing HZ and had a clinically acceptable safety profile. Here we report immunogenicity, reactogenicity and safety following administration of 2 HZ/su doses at intervals longer than 2 months.
   Methods: In this Phase III, open-label trial conducted in the US and Estonia, 354 adults >= 50 years were randomized 1:1:1 to receive 2 HZ/su doses 2, 6, or 12 months apart. gE-specific humoral immune responses were evaluated at pre-vaccination, 1 and 12 months post -dose 2. Co-primary objectives were to compare immune responses to HZ/su 1 month post-dose 2 when given 6-months or 12-months apart to those administered 2-months apart. For each participant, safety information was collected from dose 1 to 12 months post -dose 2.
   Results: 346 participants completed the study and 343 were included in the according-to-protocol cohort for immunogenicity. One month post-dose 2, vaccine response rates were 96.5% (97.5% confidence interval [CI]: 90.4; 99.2) and 94.5% (97.5% CI: 87.6; 98.3) for the 0, 6- and 0, 12-month schedules, respectively, both schedules meeting the pre-defined criterion. Non-inferiority of anti-gE geometric mean concentrations was demonstrated for HZ/su administered on 0, 6-month compared to a 0, 2-month schedule; however, HZ/su administered on a 0, 12-month schedule did not meet the non-inferiority criterion. Injection site pain was the most commonly reported solicited adverse event (AE). 26 participants each reported at least 1 serious AE; none were assessed as related to vaccination.
   Conclusions: Immune responses to HZ/su administered at 0, 6-month were non-inferior to those elicited by a 0, 2-month schedule. HZ/su exhibited a clinically acceptable safety profile for all dosing intervals. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Clostridium botulinum readily persists in the soil and secretes life-threatening botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) that are categorized into serotypes A to H, of which, serotype A (BoNT/A) is the most commonly occurring in nature. An efficacious vaccine with high longevity against BoNT intoxication is urgent. Herein, we developed a dual-route vaccine administered over four consecutive weeks by mucosal and parenteral routes, consisting of the heavy chain (Hc) of BoNT/A targeting dendritic cell peptide (DCpep) expressed by Lactobacillus acidophilus as a secretory immunogenic protein. The administered dual-route vaccine elicited robust and long-lasting memory B cell responses comprising germinal center (GC) B cells and follicular T cells (Tfh) that fully protected mice from lethal oral BoNT/A fatal intoxication. Additionally, passively transferring neutralizing antibodies against BoNT/A into naive mice induced robust protection against BoNTIA lethal intoxication. Together, a targeted vaccine employing local and systemic administrative routes may represent a novel formulation eliciting protective B cell responses with remarkable longevity against threatening biologic agents such as BoNTs.

AB Introduction: Zika virus infection during pregnancy can cause significant infant morbidity. Little is known about pregnant women's attitudes regarding behavioral strategies and hypothetical vaccination to prevent Zika infections and sequelae.
   Methods: Pregnant women across the United States (N = 362) completed an online questionnaire regarding attitudes about Zika, including six behavioral prevention strategies (i.e., abstaining from sex, using condoms, not traveling to an area with Zika, their partner not traveling into an area with Zika, using mosquito repellant, wearing long pants and sleeves) and vaccination.
   Results: Most women (91%) were married living with the baby's father, 65% were non-Hispanic White, and 71% had been pregnant. Seventy-four percent were worried about Zika, while 30% thought they were knowledgeable about Zika. The mean knowledge score was 5.0 out of 8 (SD = 2.09), and the mean behavioral strategies score was 4.9 out of 12 (SD = 3.7) with a range of 0 (none would be hard to do) to 12 (all would be hard to do). In a multivariable model, having had a sexually transmitted infection, living/traveling in an area with Zika, and worrying about Zika were significantly related to reporting behavioral strategies as hard to do. Seventy-two percent would be willing to be vaccinated. In the multivariable model, living/traveling in an area with Zika, believing they knew a lot about Zika, worrying about Zika, and considering Zika vaccine development as important were significantly associated with willingness to get vaccinated.
   Conclusions: Pregnant women were worried about Zika, yet had gaps in their factual knowledge. Most women reported they would get vaccinated if a vaccine was available. Pregnant women who reported themselves as vulnerable (being worried, having lived in or traveled to a Zika area) were more likely to view behavioral strategies as hard to do and to accept vaccination.

AB Background: Measles supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) are vaccination campaigns that supplement routine vaccination programs with a recommended second dose opportunity to children of different ages regardless of their previous history of measles vaccination. They are conducted every 2-4 years and over a few weeks in many low- and middle-income countries. While SIAs have high vaccination coverage, it is unclear whether they reach the children who miss their routine measles vaccine dose. Determining who is reached by SIAs is vital to understanding their effectiveness, as well as measure progress towards measles control.
   Methods: We examined SIAs in low- and middle-income countries from 2000 to 2014 using data from the Demographic and Health Surveys. Conditional on a child's routine measles vaccination status, we examined whether children participated in the most recent measles SIA.
   Results: The average proportion of zero-dose children (no previous routine measles vaccination defined as no vaccination date before the SIA) reached by SIAs across 14 countries was 66%, ranging from 28% in Sao Tome and Principe to 91% in Nigeria. However, when also including all children with routine measles vaccination data, this proportion decreased to 12% and to 58% when imputing data for children with vaccination reported by the mother and vaccination marks on the vaccination card across countries. Overall, the proportions of zero-dose children reached by SIAs declined with increasing household wealth.
   Conclusions: Some countries appeared to reach a higher proportion of zero-dose children using SlAs than others, with proportions reached varying according to the definition of measles vaccination (e.g., vaccination dates on the vaccination card, vaccination marks on the vaccination card, and/or self-reported data). This suggests that some countries could improve their targeting of SIAs to children who miss other measles vaccine opportunities. Across all countries, SIAs played an important role in reaching children from poor households. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Objectives: Randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of ZOSTAVAX (TM) (ZV) administered concomitantly with quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV4) in adults >= 50 years of age (NCT02519855).
   Methods: Overall, 440 participants were randomized into the Concomitant Group (CG) and 442 into the Sequential Group (SG). The CG received ZV and IIV4 at separate injection sites on Day 1 and matching placebo at Week 4. The SG received placebo and IIV4 (2015-2016 influenza season) at separate injection sites on Day 1 and ZV at Week 4.
   Immunogenicity endpoints: Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) antibody geometric mean titer (GMT) and geometric mean fold-rise (GMFR) from baseline to 4 weeks postvaccination, measured by glycoprotein enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (gpELISA) and adjusted for age and prevaccination titer. Influenza strain-specific GMT at baseline and 4 weeks postvaccination was measured by hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay.
   Safety endpoints: Injection-site and systemic adverse experiences (AEs) within 28 days following any vaccination and serious AEs throughout the study.
   Results: The adjusted VZV antibody GMT ratio (CG/SG) was 0.87 (95%CI: 0.80, 0.95), meeting the prespecified noninferiority criterion. The VZV antibody GMFR in the CG was 1.9 (95%CI: 1.76, 2.05), meeting the acceptability criterion. Influenza antibody GMT ratios for A/H1N1, A/H3N2, B/Yamagata and B/Victoria were 1.02 (95%CI: 0.88, 1.18), 1.10 (95%CI: 0.94, 1.29), 1.00 (95%CI: 0.88, 1.14), and 0.99 (95%CI: 0.87, 1.13), respectively. The frequency of vaccine-related injection-site and systemic AEs was comparable between groups. No vaccine-related serious AE was observed.
   Conclusion: The concomitant administration of ZV and IIV4 to adults >= 50 years of age induced VZV-specific and influenza-specific antibody responses that were comparable to those following administration of either vaccine alone, and was generally well tolerated.

AB The aim of this study is to assess the accuracy of different probability functions for modeling wind speed distribution at four locations, distributed over Algeria, to minimize the uncertainly in wind resource estimates. Despite mixture models perform better results, their complexity induced us to use in this work eight distributions with a maximum of three parameters, namely Weibull, Gamma, Inverse Gaussian, Log Normal, Gumbel, GEV, Nakagami and Generalized Logistic distribution to model the wind speed, fitted with four parameter estimation methods. In addition to the methods of moments and the maximum likelihood which are commonly used, the power density method and the L-moments method are developed and utilized for the first time in wind resource assessment field, to estimate the parameters of most distributions used in this work. Moreover, two goodness-of-fit tests based on the coefficient of determination and the root mean square error, are conducted in order to select good fitting probability distribution functions. According to the coefficient of determination and the root mean square error, the GEV and Gamma are the most appropriate, compared to the others used distributions. Furthermore, the L-moments method is the most effective one, among the used parameter estimators, followed by the maximum likelihood method. On the other hand, in term of power density error, different results were found, where the Power Density Method gave the best results with the Gamma, Inverse Gaussian and Log Normal distributions. Otherwise, owing to the difference in the wind characteristics for each studied site, it can be stated that to minimize the uncertainty in wind resource estimates, it is important to determine the method that gives the best parameters for each distribution.

AB The present study intended to produce biodiesel as an efficient fuel from waste Phoenix dactylifera L. kernel oil in the presence of synthesized efficient heterogeneous metallic oxide catalyst (Mn@MgO-ZrO2). The performance of synthesized metallic oxide catalyst was evaluated based on biodiesel yield and the process has been optimized. The optimum biodiesel yield was 96.4%, when process temperature was 90 degrees C, catalyst loading 3 wt%, methanol to oil ratio 15:1 and reaction duration was 4h. The product biodiesel was characterized in order to evaluate its quality according to ASTM and EN standards. Thus, characterization of biodiesel revealed that it fulfills the standard ranges defined by ASTM and EN: its acid value was 0.11 mg KOH/g, density 881 kg/m(3), viscosity 3.85 mm(2)/s, flash point 142 degrees C and suitable low-temperature properties. It can thus be concluded that synthesized heterogeneous catalyst can be used efficiently for biodiesel production from waste Phoenix dactylifera L. kernel oil which satisfied the international standards defined by ASTM and EN.

AB Thermoacoustic engine, with the outstanding characteristics of high reliability and environmental benignity, is one of the most attractive and promising energy conversions to recover low-grade thermal energy. In this paper, a three-stage looped thermoacoustic electric generator, consisting of a three-stage looped thermoacoustic engine and a linear alternator, was proposed and built. To obtain a better coupling between the thermoacoustic engine and the linear alternator, the acoustic impedance of the linear alternator has been adjusted by modulating the external electric resistance/compliance and the frequency. The frequency was adjusted by adopting the He-Ar mixture. Additionally, the location and the length of compliance tube have been optimized to improve the acoustic field in the system. Upon optimization, a maximal thermal-to-electric efficiency of 1.51% can be achieved at the hot temperature of 120 degrees C with He-Ar mixture as the working fluid, in which the mole fraction of helium was 0.63. Furthermore, the system has also been tested in the hot temperature range of 90 degrees C-200 degrees C. Results show that the thermal-to-electric efficiency stabilizes at around 1.5% when hot temperature is in the range of 120 degrees C-170 degrees C.

AB To promote development of the unitized regenerative fuel cell, a new energy conversion-storage device, it is essential to look for a bifunctional catalyst with high efficiency and catalytic properties for oxygen evolution and reduction reactions. Herein, a novel PtRuIr electrocatalyst has been synthesized by a pulse electrodeposition method with selectively electrodepositing Ir on PtRu nanoclusters. The prepared catalysts were characterized by electrochemical analysis, scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectrometer. The experimental results show that the PtRuIr catalyst with 10 mol% of Ir exhibits significantiy higher oxygen evolution and reduction currents compared to the PtRu and the PtRuIr catalysts with other contents of Ir, which is also supported by the electrochemical impedance data. In addition, a single water electrolysis cell and a H-2/O(2)fuel cell were performed simultaneously to evaluate the oxygen evolution and reduction performances, respectively, of the novel catalyst. The optimized catalyst with 90 mol% PtRu and 10mol% Ir shows higher oxygen evolution reactivity current density and higher round-trip efficiency in the water electrolysis single cell, and in the meantime, it also exhibits higher oxygen reduction current density and higher power density in the fuel cell, compared to those of the PtRu catalyst.

AB The wind speed forecasting is an important technology for the management of the wind energy. In this study, a new hybrid framework using the WPD (Wavelet Packet Decomposition), the CEEMDAN (Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition) and the ANN (Artificial Neural Network) is proposed for wind speed multi-step forecasting. In the proposed framework, the WPD is employed to decompose the original wind speed series into a series of sub-layers, while the CEEMDAN is adopted to further decompose all the obtained sub-layers into a number of IMFs (Intrinsic Mode Functions). Finally, three types of ANN models, mcluding the BP (Back-propagation Neural Network) models, the RBF (Radial Basis Function Neural Network) models and the GRNN (General Regression Neural Network) models, are utilized.to complete the predicting computation for the decomposed wind speed series, respectively. To investigate the prediction performance of the presented framework, nine models are included in the comparisons as: the BP model, the WPD-BP model, the WPD-CEEMDAN-BP model, the RBF model, the WPD-RBF model, the WPD-CEEMDAN-RBF model, the GRNN model, the WPD-GRNN model and the WPD-CEEMDAN-GRNN model.

AB Thermoelectric cooler (TEC) is attractive for cooling electronic devices because of its light, compact size, quiet and vibration free characteristics. However, its cooling performance is restricted by the thermal resistance at TEC hot side. To improve the TEC cooling performance, a gravity-assisted heat pipe (GAHP) was proposed to attach on the TEC hot side. The cooling feasibility of the TEC system coupled with a GAHP was experimentally investigated in a climatic chamber, compared with a TEC system coupled with an air cooled-heat sink on its hot side. It was observed that the cooling capacity of TEC was improved by 64.8% using GAHP. A mathematical model was established to analyze the effect of refrigerant filling ratio, TEC hot side temperature and air flow rate. Optimal parameters of the proposed system were evaluated from the heat pipe perspective. Findings showed that the optimal refrigerant filling ratio was 134%, which resulted in the maximum heat transfer ability. Increasing air flow rate was able to improve the cooling capacity but with a limitation caused by the restriction of TEC.

AB In this study, the effects of sorbent addition for in-situ CO2 removal on hydrogen production by sorption-enhanced chemical looping steam reforming (SE-CLSR) of ethanol have been evaluated in an alternating fixed-bed reactor using a mixture of NiO/Al(2)O(3)oxygen carrier catalyst (OC) and CaO based sorbent at moderate operating conditions (T: 600 degrees C, P: 1.0 atm and S:C: 3.0). The experimental data were compared with chemical equilibrium analysis based on the minimization of Gibbs free energy. The results demonstrated that NiO component in the OC was first reduced by ethanol and the reduced OC was responsible of catalytic steam reforming and water gas shift (WGS) for hydrogen production. The CO2 produced was efficiently removed by CaO based sorbent, also resulting in the process intensification considerably. It appears that the superior molar ratio of sorbent to OC (Ca/Ni) is to be 2.0-3.0 and the highest hydrogen selectivity and feeding conversion were obtained at 3.0 of Ca/Ni ratio. Hydrogen production was inhibited using further high Ca/Ni ratio due to the OC particles were surrounded and diluted by sorbent. The exothermic reactions also provided the heat to raise the temperature of the reactor. In-situ CO2 removal by solid sorbent promotes ethanol dehydration and C-C carbon bonds cleavage, and thus, the hydrogen production route of conventional CLSR is changed. Continuous high-purity hydrogen production was achieved by integrating the oxidization, steam reforming, WGS, and in situ CO2 capture in an alternating fixed-bed reactor.

AB This article presents the energetic and exergetic performance of a novel waste heat recovery system for shipboard platform, while utilising the shipboard gas turbine exhaust for simultaneous production of power and cooling using supercritical and transcritical carbon dioxide, respectively. The mathematical model for the cooling and power bottoming cycles has been developed and the results obtained are found to be in good agreement with the already published work, available in the literature. It is also found that under the specified operating conditions, the proposed system has the potential to enhance the power output by about 18% besides, providing the cooling of about 892 TR having the COP of 2.75. Further, the overall energy efficiency of the shipboard system is found to be increased by more than 11% which is also a significant improvement over the conventional topping Brayton cycle already being Used for these applications. The results obtained in this cycle model will be useful to understand and to further improve the design and performance of CO2 based power and cooling cycles for future shipboard applications.

AB An investigation on non-premixed H-2/air combustion in a cylindrical micro combustor has been carried out. The effects of porous media and outer wall thickness on the combustion characteristics, flame location, thermal performance and energy conversion efficiency of the thermo photovoltaic (TPV) system were investigated. For the application of micro TPV system, a high and uniform outer wall temperature distribution is indispensable for the sustaining output, and the high energy efficiency is desirable. The results indicate that the setting of porous media or the increase of outer wall thickness can enhance the heat transfer in micro combustor and affects the flame stability, and the micro combustor with porous media and outer wall thickness b = 0.2 mm obtains the lowest flame location. They are also conducive to the improvement of outer wall temperature and energy efficiency, the outer wall temperature of the micro combustor with a thicker outer wall and porous media is relatively uniform and the energy conversion efficiency of micro TPV system is also improved, the micro combustor with b = 0.6 mm and porous media is more suitable for the application of micro TPV system. Additionally, the external thermal environment also can improve the outer wall temperature profile and the working performance of the micro combustor.

AB This paper deals with active cooling techniques for photovoltaic panels (PVs) where a detailed review was obtained as well as analysis by examining the findings of existing literature. Based on the obtained review, an elaboration of the main performance parameters was obtained for each specific considered coolant (air, water or nanofluids). It was found that the less investigated cooling techniques are the ones related to CPV (Concentrated Photovoltaic) systems and only a few studies exist with nanofluids as the considered coolant. The majority of tested active cooling options are based on water as the coolant and for PV/T (Photovoltaic/Thermal) configurations. The economic and environmental aspects of the active cooling techniques were not analysed in the majority of research studies thus there is an obvious gap in the existing literature. Therefore, the main outcomes of the herein obtained research are reflected through summarized analysis of all important aspects related to active cooling options for PV applications (performance, economic and environmental). According to the obtained results, the highest increase in PV panel performance is achieved by water base cooling techniques and they range from about 10% to 20% on average. To analyse economic and environmental aspects, a 30 kW PV system was studied as a case study. Regarding the economic aspect, the LCOE (Levelized Cost of Electricity) for the considered case study of a 30kW PV system ranged from 0.096 epsilon/kWh to 0.159 epsilon/kWh. For the given circumstances, it was found that the considered active based cooling options were not economically viable (it is crucial to ensure optimization for the specific liquid (water) based active cooling technique followed by "smart regulation" in order to provide a more reasonable LCOE). However, with the proper optimization of active cooling techniques, it is more than reasonable to expect an additional LCOE reduction as it could significantly reduce the operating cost. The environmental analysis (LCA) showed that out of all the herein evaluated cooling techniques, the air based cooling techniques are the most harmful to the environment which is primarily due to more intense global warming and environmental acidification effect. Other environmental impacts are approximately of the same magnitude for the specific analysed active cooling options.

AB Our motivation of this study is to provide a data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach for evaluating and decomposing the operation efficiency, moreover, computing the coordination efficiency of systems with complex internal structure. We consider a two-stage system composed of three sub-systems, where the first stage is comprised of two independent sub-systems in parallel and then linked to the second stage or the third sub-system in series. Additive and multiplicative DEA efficiency measures are proposed to be jointly applied to illustrate the efficiency formation mechanism of the parallel-series system. The definition of coordination efficiency is inspired by the "gap" between accomplished optimal efficiency and idealized maximal efficiency of relevant systems. This study contributes in creating novel means to consider the different structural characteristics in the efficiency assessment of complex network systems, and to measure the externalities in terms of efficiency within their interior. The proposed models are demonstrated by revisiting the case of Taiwanese non-life insurance companies studied by Kao and Hwang. Corresponding implications of the empirical application are also discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The purpose of this paper is to propose a three-dimensional fuzzy logic approach to evaluate the level of alignment between the knowledge an enterprise possesses and the knowledge management systems (KMSs) it adopts. The study also aims to propose the KMSs best suited to reducing misalignment and improving operational performance in terms of efficiency and effectiveness, analysing the level of alignment between an enterprise's knowledge and its KMSs from both the ontological and epistemological points of view. The authors have used the proposed methodology to develop a software-based Knowledge Management Decision Support System (KM-DSS), which was tested on a small and medium enterprise (SME) operating in the high-tech industry. The results highlight that the proposed DSS allows managers to evaluate knowledge management processes and identify which KMSs to adopt to improve alignment with the nature of the knowledge their enterprise possesses as well as to increase their level of efficiency and effectiveness.

AB With the increase of online customer opinions in specialised websites and social networks, automatic systems to help organise and classify customer reviews by domain-specific aspect categories and sentiment polarity are more needed than ever. Supervised approaches for Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis achieve good results for the domain and language they are trained on, but manually labelling data to train supervised systems for all domains and languages is very costly and time consuming. In this work, we describe W2VLDA, an almost unsupervised system based on topic modelling that, combined with some other unsupervised methods and a minimal configuration step, performs aspect category classification, aspect-term and opinion-word separation and sentiment polarity classification for any given domain and language. We evaluate its domain aspect and sentiment classification performance in the multilingual SemEval 2016 task 5 (ABSA) dataset. We show competitive results for several domains (hotels, restaurants, electronic devices) and languages (English, Spanish, French and Dutch). (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Due to the unprecedented speed and volume of generated raw data in most of applications, data stream mining has attracted a lot of attention recently. Methods for solving these problems should address challenges in this area such as infinite length, concept-drift, recurring concepts, and concept-evolution. Moreover, due to the speedy intrinsic of data streams, the time and space complexity of the methods are extremely important. This paper proposes a novel method based on multiple-kernels for classifying non-stationary data streams, which addresses the mentioned challenges with special attention to the space complexity. By learning multiple kernels and specifying the boundaries of classes in the feature (mapped) space of combined kernels, the required amount of memory will be decreased, These kernels will be updated regularly throughout the stream when the true labels of instances are received. Newly arrived instances will be classified with respect to their distance to boundaries of the previously known classes in the feature spaces. Due to the efficient memory usage, the computation time does not increase significantly through the stream. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method using a set of experiments conducted on both real and synthetic benchmark data sets. The experimental results show the superiority of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art methods in this area. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Data clustering is a very useful data mining technique to find groups of similar objects present in the dataset. Scalability to handle immense volumes, robustness to intrinsic outlier data and validity of clustering results are the main challenges of any data clustering approach. In order to address these challenges, a fuzzy weighted clustering approach which is comprehensibly parallel and distributed in every phase, is proposed in this research. Although the proposed method can be used for various data clustering purposes, it has been applied in gene expression clustering to reveal functional relationships of genes in a biological process. Conforming to MapReduce, the proposed method also presents a novel similarity measure which benefits from combining ordered weighted averaging and Spearman correlation coefficient. In the proposed method, density reachable genes were joined to establish subclusters. Afterwards, final cluster results were obtained by merging these subclusters. A voting system detects the best weights and consequently the most valid clusters among all possible results for each distinct dataset. The whole algorithm is implemented on a distributed processing platform and it is scalable to process any size of data stored in cloud infrastructures.
   Precision of resulting clusters were evaluated using some of the well-known cluster validity indexes in the literature. Also, the efficiency of the proposed method in scalability and robustness was compared with recently published similar researches. In all the mentioned comparisons, the proposed method outperformed recent works on the same datasets. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID SCHEME
AB This paper presents a new fragile watermarking method for digital audio authenticity for audio forensics purposes. The aim is to verify if an audio proof has been tampered and to locate the segments where the signal was modified. Our proposal is based on an embedding process of a text that is encoded through OVSF (Orthogonal Variable Spreading Factor) codes and spread into the entire signal using automatic adjustment. Several tests were performed in order to quantify the accuracy and the reliability of the tampering detection against four classical attacks (cropping, replacement, additive noise and amplitude reduction) by using kappa index, sensitivity and specificity. It was demonstrated that even if a small number of samples is modified, the system correctly labels the audio proof as manipulated, and locates both the start and end of the manipulation; the kappa index (reliability) is around 0.96, sensitivity is always 1, and specificity is around 0.995. The proposed algorithm could be used as a decision support tool for audio forensics verification purposes, that allows to identify if an audio proof has been modified, and the time segments in which it has been modified.

AB In this paper, a discrete Water Wave Optimization algorithm (DWWO) is proposed to solve the no-wait flowshop scheduling problem (NWFSP) with respect to the makespan criterion. Inspired by the shallow water wave theory, the original Water Wave Optimization (WWO) is constructed for global optimization problems with propagation, refraction and breaking operators. The operators to adapt to the combinatorial optimization problems are redefined. A dynamic iterated greedy algorithm with a changing removing size is employed as the propagation operator to enhance the exploration ability. In refraction operator, a crossover strategy is employed by DWWO to avoid the algorithm falling into local optima. To improve the exploitation ability of local search, an insertion-based local search scheme which is utilized as breaking operator, is applied to search for a better solution around the current optimal solution. A ruling out inferior solution operator is also introduced to improve the convergence speed. The global convergence performance of the DWWO is analyzed with the Markov model. In addition, the computational results based on well-known benchmarks and statistical performance comparisons are presented. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed DWWO algorithm for solving NWFSP. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Appropriately identifying outlier data is a critical requirement in the decision-making process of many expert and intelligent systems deployed in a variety of fields including finance, medicine, and defense. Classical outlier detection schemes typically rely on the assumption that normal/background data of interest are distributed according to an assumed statistical model and search for data that deviate from that assumption. However, it is frequently the case that performance is reduced because the underlying distribution does not follow the assumed model. Manifold learning techniques offer improved performance by learning better models of the background but can be too computationally expensive due to the need to calculate a distance measure between all data points. Here, we study a general framework that allows manifold learning techniques to be used for unsupervised anomaly detection by reducing computational expense via a uniform random sampling of a small fraction of the data. A background manifold is learned from the sample and then an out-of-sample extension is used to project unsampled data into the learned manifold space and construct an anomaly detection statistic based on the prediction error of the learned manifold. The method works well for unsupervised anomaly detection because, by definition, the ratio of anomalous to non-anomalous data points is small and the sampling will be dominated by background points. However, a variety of parameters that affect detection performance are introduced so we use here a low-dimensional toy problem to investigate their effect on the performance of four learning algorithm (kernel PCA, two versions of diffusion map, and the Parzen density estimator). We then apply the methods to the detection of watercraft in an ensemble of 22 infrared maritime scenes where we find kernel PCA to be superior and show that it outperforms a commonly employed baseline algorithm. The framework is not limited to the tested image processing example and can be used for any unsupervised anomaly detection task. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In today's world of digitization, the rise of the e-commerce business around the globe has brought a tremendous change not only in our purchasing habits, but also to the entire retail and logistics industry. Given the irregular e-commerce order arrival patterns, limited time for order processing in e-fulfilment centres, and the guaranteed delivery schedules offered by e-retailers, such as same-day or next-day delivery upon placing an order, logistics service providers (LSPs) must be extremely efficient in handling outsourced e-commerce logistics orders. Without re-engineering the order fulfilment processes, the LSPs are found to have difficulties in executing the order fulfilment process due to the tight handling requirements. This, in turn, delays the subsequent processes in the supply chain, such as last-mile delivery operations, consequently affecting customer satisfaction towards both the retailer and the LSP. In view of the need to improve the efficiency in handling e-commerce orders, this study aims at re-engineering the fulfilment process of e-commerce orders in distribution centres. The concept of warehouse postponement is embedded into a new cloud-based e-order fulfilment pre-processing system (CEPS), by incorporating the genetic algorithm (GA) approach for e-commerce order grouping decision support and a rule-based inference engine for generating operating guidelines and suggesting the use of appropriate handling equipment. Through a case study conducted in a logistics company, the CEPS provides order handling solutions for processing e-commerce logistics orders very efficiently, with a significant reduction in order processing time and traveling distance. In turn, improved operating efficiency in e-commerce order handling allows LSPs to better align strategically with online retailers, who provide customers with aggressive, guaranteed delivery dates.

AB Lane changing maneuver is one of the most important driving behaviors. Unreasonable lane changes can cause serious collisions and consequent traffic delays. High precision prediction of lane changing intent is helpful for improving driving safety. In this study, by fusing information from vehicle sensors, a lane changing predictor based on Adaptive Fuzzy Neural Network (AFFN) is proposed to predict steering angles. The prediction model includes two parts: fuzzy neural network based on Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy inference, in which an improved Least Squares Estimator (LSE) is adopt to optimize parameters; adaptive learning algorithm to update membership functions and rule base. Experiments are conducted in the driving simulator under scenarios with different speed levels of lead vehicle: 60 km/h, 80 km/h and 100 km/h. Prediction results show that the proposed method is able to accurately follow steering angle patterns. Furthermore, comparison of prediction performance with several machine learning methods further verifies the learning ability of the AFNN. Finally, a sensibility analysis indicates heading angles and acceleration of vehicle are also important factors for predicting lane changing behavior. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Novel advance driver assistance systems, such as emergency braking and adaptive cruise control require the most reliable detection algorithms. Furthermore, in the recent years, the use of computer vision approaches in these type of applications is becoming more frequent. However, when dealing with these technologies, reliability is a very important factor that still requires improvement. On this paper, it is presented a tracking algorithm which aims in improving the accuracy of these applications, based on computer vision and modern Probability Hypothesis Density (PHD) Filter technique. The tracking is performed on the features detected within the bounding box provided by a computer video based vehicle detection algorithm. The features tracked are combined in a last stage, providing accurate monocular camera tracking. Test provided, allowed to identify the best method for feature combination. Furthermore, it was proved that under the proper visibility conditions, the PHD filter design is able to improve current methods such as Unscented Kalman Filter. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB With the increasing number of surveillance cameras in both indoor and outdoor locations, there is a grown demand for an intelligent system that detects abnormal events. Although human action recognition is a highly reached topic in computer vision, abnormal behavior detection is lately attracting more research attention. Indeed, several systems are proposed in order to ensure human safety. In this paper, we are interested in the study of the two main steps composing a video surveillance system which are the behavior representation and the behavior modeling. Techniques related to feature extraction and description for behavior representation are reviewed. Classification methods and frameworks for behavior modeling are also provided. Moreover, available datasets and metrics for performance evaluation are presented. Finally, examples of existing video surveillance systems used in real world are described. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This is the first comprehensive report on fatty acids profile of fats & oil commonly consumed in India. Every variety of edible oil showed its own unique fatty acid profile with significant variation within each individual fatty acid. Pure safflower oil exhibited the highest total TPUFA (76.78%) while the highest TSFA was noticed for coconut oil (90.84%). High level of erucic acid in the range of 48.5 to 54.2% was observed in mustard oil.. Groundnut and rice bran oils showed TPUFA/TSFA ratio closer to WHO recommended value. Several vanaspati samples exhibited trans fatty acid beyond the permitted limit while trace amount of the same was also detected in ghee. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB AOAC 2011.25 method enables the quantification of most of the dietary fiber (DF) components according to the definition proposed by Codex Alimentarius. This study aimed to compare the DF content in fruits analyzed by the AOAC 2011.25 and AOAC 991.43 methods. Plums (Prunus salicina), atemoyas (Annona x atemoya), jackfruits (Artocarpus heterophyllus), and mature coconuts (Cocos nucifera) from different Brazilian regions (3 lots/fruit) were analyzed for DF, resistant starch, and fructans contents. The AOAC 2011.25 method was evaluated for precision, accuracy, and linearity in different food matrices and carbohydrate standards. The DF contents of plums, atemoyas, and jackfruits obtained by AOAC 2011.25 was higher than those obtained by AOAC 991.43 due to the presence of fructans. The DF content of mature coconuts obtained by the same methods did not present a significant difference. The AOAC 2011.25 method is recommended for fruits with considerable fructans content because it achieves more accurate values. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB For nearly 20 years, the National Food and Nutrient Analysis Program (NFNAP) has expanded and improved the quantity and quality of data in US Department of Agriculture's (USDA) food composition databases (FCDB) through the collection and analysis of nationally representative food samples. NFNAP employs statistically valid sampling plans, the Key Foods approach to identify and prioritize foods and nutrients, comprehensive quality control protocols, and analytical oversight to generate new and updated analytical data for food components. NFNAP has allowed the Nutrient Data Laboratory to keep up with the dynamic US food supply and emerging scientific research. Recently generated results for nationally representative food samples show marked changes compared to previous database values for selected nutrients. Monitoring changes in the composition of foods is critical in keeping FCDB up-to-date, so that they remain a vital tool in assessing the nutrient intake of national populations, as well as for providing dietary advice.

AB The composition of kiwifruit is important for understanding the nutritional value of kiwifruit for consumption. Our aim was to develop a reference nutritional composition profile for a gold-fleshed kiwifruit Zespri (R) SunGold Kiwifruit and a green-fleshed kiwifruit Zespri (R) Sweet Green Kiwifruit. Ten representative single-replicate (10 growers) samples, each containing 40 fruit, were prepared for both kiwifruit varieties. Samples were analysed for macronutrients, minerals, and vitamins. The analytical results reveal that the nutrient composition of SunGold and Sweet Green are largely similar to other commercially available kiwifruits. However, a key difference is the elevated levels of vitamin C in SunGold (161 mg/100 g edible flesh) and Sweet Green, (150 mg/100 g), compared to 85 mg/100 g commonly found for the green 'Hayward' variety. Levels of dietary fibre, potassium, vitamin E, and folate are similar to other commercial kiwifruit Zespri (R) Gold Kiwifruit ('Hort16A') and Green Kiwifruit ('Hayward'), confirming kiwifruit as a good source of these nutrients.

AB In the past decade, the 800 km elongated mud belt off Zhejiang-Fujian coast, East China Sea (ECS), has been extensively studied for understanding the source to sink processes on the East Asian continental margin in the context of the Asian monsoon. However, to better understand the sediment source and dispersal pattern, the existing mineralogical and geochemical data of adjacent river systems, including the Changjiang River (CJR) and local rivers in Zhejiang, Fujian and Taiwan, need to be systematically reviewed. Therefore, various indicators from published literatures for the provenance discrimination in the mud belt have been summarised in this article. The results show that high diversity of clay mineral assemblages in fluvial sediments being supplied into the mud belt, e.g., dominant illite and chlorite in the CJR, absence of smectite in Taiwan rivers, similar amounts of the four clay mineral species in Zhejiang rivers, and dominant kaolinite in Fujian rivers. On heavy mineralogy, the CJR is dominated by dolomite, hornblende, and flaky minerals; and among of them, dolomite is distinctive for the CJR. For geochemical approaches, elemental compositions, combined with strontium and neodymium isotopes, reflect strong provenance control. However, geochemical and mineralogical compositions are found to vary with grain size, and thus extra caution should be taken when using these parameters as provenance indicator to discriminate the marine sediments with variety of grain-size fractions. In addition, pyrrhotite, occurred in fluvial sediments from western Taiwan, has not been found in sediments derived from mainland China, indicating that magnetic parameters could be used to discriminate sediment provenance. The mud belt formed during sea-level highstand, when modern current system in the ECS has been established, resulting in sediments derived from the CJR have been transported southward since 8 ka. In addition, sediment provenances have not been constant since initiation of the mud belt in response to climatic and oceanographic changes during the Holocene, which has been documented by mineral and geochemical signals. Nevertheless significant studies have been carried out, to better understand the formation mechanism for the mud belt and its implications for environmental changes, further studies on sediment provenance throughout the Holocene, in situ observation, and sedimentation dynamical modelling are required.

AB High resolution paleomagnetic investigations were performed on a 50.08 m long sediment core (MD161/20) from Mahanadi basin, Bay of Bengal. Core yielded reliable paleomagnetic results for top 20 m below seafloor (mbsf) which spans about 80 ka. Based on the analysis of rock magnetic data, the core is subdivided into five distinct Zones: Zone 1 and Zone 2 cover top 20 mbsf and do not show any abrupt change in magnetic mineralogy, concentration and grain size. Zones 3 and 5 show significant reduction in chi(LF), chi(ARM) and SIRM due to dissolution of magnetic minerals. Zone 4 shows moderate values of chi(LF) and SIRM. The low value of Mum suggests that magnetic signal is mostly carried by magnetic grains in PSD/MD state. The paleomagnetic data for the top 20 mbsf show four prominent geomagnetic excursions at similar to 9 mbsf, similar to 13.5 to 15 mbsf, similar to 16.3 mbsf and similar to 18 to 18.2 mbsf. The age-depth relationship is established using stratigraphic correlation between well-dated sedimentary core NGHP-01-19B and the core MD161/20. The ages of the observed excursions correspond to similar to 18 to 20 ka, similar to 42 to 49 ka, similar to 54 to 57 ka and similar to 69 to 70 ka. The excursions at similar to 42 to 49 ka, similar to 54 to 57 ka, and similar to 67 to 70 ka is similar to the known excursions the Laschamp and the split Norwegian-Greenland Sea events (NGS-I and NGSII). The excursion at 18-20 ka is not observed globally and may be related to lithological/sedimentological changes occurring during last glacial maxima (LGM). The virtual geomagnetic path (VGP) of Laschamp excursion traces clockwise loop. All excursions identified in present study fall in the periods of relatively low paleointensity.

AB Natural hydrocarbon seepage is a widespread phenomenon in sedimentary basins, with important implications in petroleum exploration and emission of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. China has vast petroleum (oil and gas) bearing sedimentary basins, but hydrocarbon seepage has rarely been the object of systematic studies and measurements. Based on the available Chinese literature, we report a first inventory of 932 hydrocarbon seeps or seepage zones (710 onshore seeps and 222 offshore seeps), including 81 mud volcanoes, 449 oil seeps, 215 gas seeps, and 187 solid seeps (bitumen outcrops). The seeps are located within the main 20 Mesozoic-Cenozoic petroliferous sedimentary basins, especially along the marginal, regional and local faults. The type of manifestations (oil, gas or mud volcano) reflects the type and maturity of the subsurface petroleum system and the sedimentary conditions of the basin. Oil seeps are particularly abundant in the Junggar Basin. Gas seeps mostly developed in the Lunpola Basin, in smaller basins of the eastern Guizhou and Yunnan provinces, onshore Taiwan and in the offshore Yinggehai Basin. Mud volcanoes developed in basins (Junggar, Qaidam, Qiangtang, onshore and offshore Taiwan) that experienced rapid sedimentation, which induced gravitative instability of shales and diapirism. In comparison to available global onshore seep data-bases, China results to be the country with the highest number of seeps in the world. The massive gas seepage in China could represent a considerable natural source of methane to the atmosphere, and a key process that may drive future hydrocarbon exploration.

ID CLASSIFICATION; VALIDATION
AB We proposed an unsupervised hybrid method - Intelligent Word Embedding (IWE) that combines neural embedding method with a semantic dictionary mapping technique for creating a dense vector representation of unstructured radiology reports. We applied IWE to generate embedding of chest CT radiology reports from two healthcare organizations and utilized the vector representations to semi-automate report categorization based on clinically relevant categorization related to the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE). We benchmark the performance against a state-of-the-art rule-based tool, PeFinder and out-of-the-box word2vec. On the Stanford test set, the IWE model achieved average F1 score 0.97, whereas the PeFinder scored 0.9 and the original word2vec scored 0.94. On UPMC dataset, the IWE model's average F1 score was 0.94, when the PeFinder scored 0.92 and word2vec scored 0.85. The IWE model had lowest generalization error with highest F1 scores. Of particular interest, the IWE model (trained on the Stanford dataset) outperformed PeFinder on the UPMC dataset which was used originally to tailor the PeFinder model.

   REPRESENTATION
AB Introduction: Electronic audit and feedback (e-A&F) systems are used worldwide for care quality improvement. They measure health professionals' performance against clinical guidelines, and some systems suggest improvement actions. However, little is known about optimal interface designs for e-A&F, in particular how to present suggested actions for improvement. We developed a novel theory-informed system for primary care (the Performance Improvement plaN GeneratoR; PINGR) that covers the four principal interface components: clinical performance summaries; patient lists; detailed patient-level information; and suggested actions. As far as we are aware, this is the first report of an e-A&F system with all four interface components.
   Objectives: (1) Use a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods to evaluate the usability of PINGR with target end-users; (2) refine existing design recommendations for e-A&F systems; (3) determine the implications of these recommendations for patient safety.
   Methods: We recruited seven primary care physicians to perform seven tasks with PINGR, during which we measured on-screen behaviour and eye movements. Participants subsequently completed usability questionnaires, and were interviewed in-depth. Data were integrated to: gain a more complete understanding of usability issues; enhance and explain each other's findings; and triangulate results to increase validity.
   Results: Participants committed a median of 10 errors (range 8-21) when using PINGR's interface, and completed a median of five out of seven tasks (range 4-7). Errors violated six usability heuristics: clear response options; perceptual grouping and data relationships; representational formats; unambiguous description; visually distinct screens for confusable items; and workflow integration. Eye movement analysis revealed the integration of components largely supported effective user workflow, although the modular design of clinical performance summaries unnecessarily increased cognitive load. Interviews and questionnaires revealed PINGR is user-friendly, and that improved information prioritisation could further promote useful user action.
   Conclusions: Comparing our results with the wider usability literature we refine a previously published set of interface design recommendations for e-A&F. The implications for patient safety are significant regarding: user engagement; actionability; and information prioritisation. Our results also support adopting multi-method approaches in usability studies to maximise issue discovery and the credibility of findings.

AB Objective: To review published empirical literature on the use of smartphone-based passive sensing for health and wellbeing.
   Material and methods: A systematic review of the English language literature was performed following PRISMA guidelines. Papers indexed in computing, technology, and medical databases were included if they were empirical, focused on health and/or wellbeing, involved the collection of data via smartphones, and described the utilized technology as passive or requiring minimal user interaction.
   Results: Thirty-five papers were included in the review. Studies were performed around the world, with samples of up to 171 (median n = 15) representing individuals with bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, depression, older adults, and the general population. The majority of studies used the Android operating system and an array of smartphone sensors, most frequently capturing accelerometry, location, audio, and usage data. Captured data were usually sent to a remote server for processing but were shared with participants in only 40% of studies. Reported benefits of passive sensing included accurately detecting changes in status, behavior change through feedback, and increased accountability in participants. Studies reported facing technical, methodological, and privacy challenges.
   Discussion: Studies in the nascent area of smartphone-based passive sensing for health and wellbeing demonstrate promise and invite continued research and investment. Existing studies suffer from weaknesses in research design, lack of feedback and clinical integration, and inadequate attention to privacy issues. Key recommendations relate to developing passive sensing strategies matching the problem at hand, using personalized interventions, and addressing methodological and privacy challenges.
   Conclusion: As evolving passive sensing technology presents new possibilities for health and wellbeing, additional research must address methodological, clinical integration, and privacy issues. Doing so depends on interdisciplinary collaboration between informatics and clinical experts.

AB The main motivation with the present study is to achieve a provably stable high-order accurate finite difference discretisation of linear first-order hyperbolic problems on a staggered grid. The use of a staggered grid makes it non-trivial to discretise advective terms. To overcome this difficulty we discretise the advective terms using upwind Summation-By-Parts (SBP) operators, while the remaining terms are discretised using staggered SBP operators. The upwind and staggered SBP operators (for each order of accuracy) are compatible, here meaning that they are based on the same diagonal norms, allowing for energy estimates to be formulated. The boundary conditions are imposed using a penalty (SAT) technique, to guarantee linear stability. The resulting SBP-SAT approximations lead to fully explicit ODE systems. The accuracy and stability properties are demonstrated for linear hyperbolic problems in 1D, and for the 2D linearised Euler equations with constant background flow. The newly derived upwind and staggered SBP operators lead to significantly more accurate numerical approximations, compared with the exclusive usage of (previously derived) central-difference first derivative SBP operators.

ID DECOMPOSITION; EXPANSION; SIMULATION; TURBULENCE; CHANNEL; FLOW
AB A new semi-analytical approach is presented to solving the matrix eigenvalue problem or the integral equation in Karhunen-Loeve (K-L) representation of random data such as irregular ocean waves. Instead of direct numerical approach to this matrix eigenvalue problem, which may suffer from the computational inaccuracy for big data, a pair of integral and differential equations are considered, which are related to the so-called prolate spheroidal wave functions (PSWF). First, the PSWF is expressed as a summation of a small number of the analytical Legendre functions. After substituting them into the PSWF differential equation, a much smaller size matrix eigenvalue problem is obtained than the direct numerical K-L matrix eigenvalue problem. By solving this with a minimal numerical effort, the PSWF and the associated eigenvalue of the PSWF differential equation are obtained. Then, the eigenvalue of the PSWF integral equation is analytically expressed by the functional values of the PSWF and the eigenvalues obtained in the PSWF differential equation. Finally, the analytically expressed PSWFs and the eigenvalues in the PWSF integral equation are used to form the kernel matrix in the K-L integral equation for the representation of exemplary wave data such as ordinary irregular waves. It is found that, with the same accuracy, the required memory size of the present method is smaller than that of the direct numerical K-L representation and the computation time of the present method is shorter than that of the semi-analytical method based on the sinusoidal functions.

AB We present in this article a novel distributed Lagrange multiplier/fictitious domain (DLM/FD) method for simulating fluid-particle interaction in three-dimensional (3D) Stokes flow. The methodology is validated by comparing the numerical results for a neutrally buoyant particle, of either spherical or prolate shape, with the associated Jeffrey's solutions for a simple shear flow. The results concerning two balls, interacting under creeping flow conditions in a bounded shear flow, are consistent with those available in the literature. We will discuss also the interactions of two balls in a bounded shear flow, when these balls are very close initially. For a prolate ellipsoid rotating in a shear flow under the sole effect of the particle inertia, shear plane tumbling is stable, while log-rolling is unstable. For two prolate ellipsoids interacting in a bounded shear flow, the results are similar to those for two balls if the major axes are initially orthogonal to the shear plane (a result not at all surprising considering that the intersections of the ellipsoids with the shear pane are circular).

AB Many interesting astrophysical and atmospheric problems involve flows near the hydrostatic equilibrium state where the pressure gradient is balanced by the gravitational force. In this paper, we design high order well-balanced discontinuous Galerkin methods for the Euler equations with gravitation, which can preserve the discrete polytropic and isothermal hydrostatic balance states exactly. To achieve the well-balancedness, we propose to combine the numerical fluxes based on a generalized hydrostatic reconstruction, with an equilibrium state recovery technique and a novel source term approximation. Extensive one-and two-dimensional numerical examples are shown to demonstrate the performance of our well-balanced methods, and comparison with non-well-balanced results is included to illustrate the importance of maintaining the balance between pressure gradient and gravitational force numerically.

AB We present a mass-conservative full approximation storage (FAS) multigrid solver for cell-centered finite difference methods on block-structured, locally cartesian grids. The algorithm is essentially a standard adaptive FAS (AFAS) scheme, but with a simple modification that comes in the form of a mass-conservative correction to the coarse-level force. This correction is facilitated by the creation of a zombie variable, analogous to a ghost variable, but defined on the coarse grid and lying under the fine grid refinement patch. We show that a number of different types of fine-level ghost cell interpolation strategies could be used in our framework, including low-order linear interpolation. In our approach, the smoother, prolongation, and restriction operations need never be aware of the mass conservation conditions at the coarse-fine interface. To maintain global mass conservation, we need only modify the usual FAS algorithm by correcting the coarse-level force function at points adjacent to the coarse-fine interface. We demonstrate through simulations that the solver converges geometrically, at a rate that is h-independent, and we show the generality of the solver, applying it to several nonlinear, time-dependent, and multi-dimensional problems. In several tests, we show that second-order asymptotic (h -> 0) convergence is observed for the discretizations, provided that (1) at least linear interpolation of the ghost variables is employed, and (2) the mass conservation corrections are applied to the coarse-level force term.

AB Natural or planted vegetation at the edge of fields or adjacent to streams, also known as vegetative filter strips (VFS), are commonly used as an environmental mitigation practice for runoff pollution and agro-chemical spray drift. The VFS position in lowlands near water bodies often implies the presence of a seasonal shallow water table (WT). In spite of its potential importance, there is limited experimental work that systematically studies the effect of shallow WTs on VFS efficacy. Previous research recently coupled a new physically based algorithm describing infiltration into soils bounded by a water table into the VFS numerical overland flow and transport model, VFSMOD, to simulate VFS dynamics under shallow WT conditions. In this study, we tested the performance of the model against laboratory mesoscale data under controlled conditions. A laboratory soil box (1.0 m wide, 2.0 m long, and 0.7 m deep) was used to simulate a VFS and quantify the influence of shallow WTs on runoff. Experiments included planted Bermuda grass on repacked silt loam and sandy loam soils. A series of experiments were performed including a free drainage case (no WT) and a static shallow water table (0.3-0.4 m below ground surface). For each soil type, this research first calibrated VFSMOD to the observed outflow hydrograph for the free drainage experiments to parameterize the soil hydraulic and vegetation parameters, and then evaluated the model based on outflow hydrographs for the shallow WT experiments. This research used several statistical metrics and a new approach based on hypothesis testing of the Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (NSE) to evaluate model performance. The new VFSMOD routines successfully simulated the outflow hydrographs under both free drainage and shallow WT conditions. Statistical metrics considered the model performance valid with greater than 99.5% probability across all scenarios. This research also simulated the shallow water table experiments with both free drainage and various water table depths to quantify the effect of assuming the former boundary condition. For these two soil types, shallow WTs within 1.0-1.2 m below the soil surface influenced infiltration. Existing models will suggest a more protective vegetative filter strip than what actually exists if shallow water table conditions are not considered. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Uncertainty estimation of climate change impacts on hydrology has received much attention in the research community. The choice of a global climate model (GCM) is usually considered as the largest contributor to the uncertainty of climate change impacts. The temporal variation of GCM uncertainty needs to be investigated for making long-term decisions to deal with climate change. Accordingly, this study investigated the temporal variation (mainly long-term) of uncertainty related to the choice of a GCM in predicting climate change impacts on hydrology by using multi-GCMs over multiple continuous future periods. Specifically, twenty CMIP5 GCMs under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 emission scenarios were adapted to adequately represent this uncertainty envelope, fifty-one 30-year future periods moving from 2021 to 2100 with 1-year interval were produced to express the temporal variation. Future climatic and hydrological regimes over all future periods were compared to those in the reference period (1971-2000) using a set of metrics, including mean and extremes. The periodicity of climatic and hydrological changes and their uncertainty were analyzed using wavelet analysis, while the trend was analyzed using Mann Kendall trend test and regression analysis. The results showed that both future climate change (precipitation and temperature) and hydrological response predicted by the twenty GCMs were highly uncertain, and the uncertainty increased significantly over time. For example, the change of mean annual precipitation increased from 1.4% in 2021-2050 to 6.5% in 2071-2100 for RCP4.5 in terms of the median value of multi-models, but the projected uncertainty reached 21.7% in 2021-2050 and 25.1% in 20712100 for RCP4.5. The uncertainty under a high emission scenario (RCP8.5) was much larger than that under a relatively low emission scenario (RCP4.5). Almost all climatic and hydrological regimes and their uncertainty did not show significant periodicity at the P = .05 significance level, but their temporal variation could be well modeled by using the fourth-order polynomial. Overall, this study further emphasized the importance of using multiple GCMs for studying climate change impacts on hydrology. Furthermore, the temporal variation of uncertainty sourced from GCMs should be given more attention. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB C As the global demands for the use of freshwater resources continues to rise, it has become increasingly important to insure the sustainability of this resources. This is accomplished through the use of management strategies that often utilize monitoring and the use of hydrological models. However, monitoring at large scales is not feasible and therefore model applications are becoming challenging, especially when spatially distributed datasets, such as evapotranspiration, are needed to understand the model performances. Due to these limitations, most of the hydrological models are only calibrated for data obtained from site/point observations, such as streamflow. Therefore, the main focus of this paper is to examine whether the incorporation of remotely sensed and spatially distributed datasets can improve the overall performance of the model. In this study, actual evapotranspiration (ETa) data was obtained from the two different sets of satellite based remote sensing data. One dataset estimates ETa based on the Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop) model while the other one estimates ETa based on the Atmosphere Land Exchange Inverse (ALEXI) model. The hydrological model used in this study is the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), which was calibrated against spatially distributed ETa and single point stream flow records for the Honeyoey Creek-Pine Creek Watershed, located in Michigan, USA. Two different techniques, multi-variable and genetic algorithm, were used to calibrate the SWAT model. Using the aforementioned datasets, the performance of the hydrological model in estimating ETa was improved using both calibration techniques by achieving Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) values >0.5 (0.73-0.85), percent bias (PBIAS) values within +/- 25% (+/- 21.73%), and root mean squared error - observations standard deviation ratio (RSR) values <0.7 (0.39-0.52). However, the genetic algorithm technique was more effective with the ETa calibration while significantly reducing the model performance for estimating the streamflow (NSE: 0.32-0.52, PBIAS: +/- 32.73%, and RSR: 0.63-0.82). Meanwhile, using the multi-variable technique, the model performance for estimating the streamflow was maintained with a high level of accuracy (NSE: 0.59-0.61, PBIAS: 13.70%, and RSR: 0.63-0.64) while the evapotranspiration estimations were improved. Results from this assessment shows that incorporation of remotely sensed and spatially distributed data can improve the hydrological model performance if it is coupled with a right calibration technique.

AB The characteristic intermittency of rainfall includes temporary cessations (hiatuses), as well as periods of very low intensity within more intense events. To understand how these characteristics of rainfall affect overland flow production, rainfall simulations involving repeated cycles of on-off intermittency were carried out on dryland soils in arid western New South Wales, Australia. Periods of rain (10 mm/h) and no rain were applied in alternation with cycle times from 3 min to 25 min, in experiments lasting 1-1.5 h. Results showed that intermittency could delay the onset of runoff by more than 30 min, reduce the runoff ratio, reduce the peak runoff rate, and reduce the apparent event infiltration rate by 30-45%. When hiatuses in rainfall were longer than 15-20 min, runoff that had resulted from prior rain ceased completely before the recommencement of rain. Results demonstrate that if rainfall intermittency is not accounted for, estimates of infiltrability based on runoff plot data can be systematically in error. Despite the use of intermittent rain, the episodic occurrence of runoff could be predicted successfully by fitting multiple affine Horton infiltration equations, whose changing f(o) and K-t coefficients, but uniform values of f(c), reflected the redistribution of soil moisture and the change in the infiltrability f during hiatuses in rainfall. The value of f(c) varied little among the fitted equations, so constituting an affine set of relationships. This new approach provides an alternative to the use of steady-state methods that are common in rainfall simulation experiments and which typically yield only an estimate of f(c). The new field results confirm that intermittency affects infiltration and runoff depths and timing at plot scale and on intra-event time scales. Additional work on other soil types, and at other spatial and temporal scales, is needed to test the generality of these findings. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The self-organizing map (SOM) is implemented to investigate the interactive mechanism between surface water and groundwater over the river basin based on large high-dimensional data sets coupled with their occurrence times. We find that extracting the occurrence time from each 30-day moving average data set in the clustered neurons of the SOM is a crucial step to learn the spatio-temporal interaction between surface water and groundwater. We design 2-D Topological Bubble Map to summarize all the groundwater values of four aquifers in a neuron, which can visibly explore the major features of the groundwater in the vertical direction. The constructed SOM topological maps nicely display that: (1) the groundwater movement, in general, extends from the eastern area to the western, where groundwater in the eastern area can be easily recharged from precipitation in wet seasons and discharged into streams during dry seasons due to the high permeability in this area; (2) the water movements in the four aquifers of the study area are quite different, and the seasonal variations of groundwater in the second and third aquifers are larger than those of the others; and (3) the spatial distribution and seasonal variations of groundwater and surface water are comprehensively linked together over the constructed maps to present groundwater characteristics and the interrelation between groundwater and surface water. The proposed modeling methodology not only can classify the large complex high-dimensional data sets into visible topological maps to effectively facilitate the quantitative status of regional groundwater resources but can also provide useful elaboration for future groundwater management.

AB Streamflow discharge is a fundamental dataset required to effectively manage water and land resources. However, developing robust stage - discharge relationships called rating curves, from which streamflow discharge is derived, is time consuming and costly, particularly in remote areas and especially at high stage levels. As a result stage - discharge relationships are often heavily extrapolated. Hydrodynamic (HD) models are physically based models used to simulate the flow of water along river channels and over adjacent floodplains. In this paper we demonstrate a method by which a HD model can be used to generate a 'synthetic' stage - discharge relationship at high stages. The method uses a both-side Box-Cox transformation to calibrate the synthetic rating curve such that the regression residuals are as close to the normal distribution as possible. By doing this both-side transformation, the statistical uncertainty in the synthetically derived stage - discharge relationship can be calculated. This enables people trying to make decisions to determine whether the uncertainty in the synthetically generated rating curve at high stage levels is acceptable for their decision. The proposed method is demonstrated in two streamflow gauging stations in north Queensland, Australia. Crown Copyright (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The thermal regime of rivers plays an important role in the overall health and composition of aquatic ecosystems, and together with flow, is recognised as one of the most influential abiotic drivers of aquatic ecosystem processes affecting species distribution. Changes in thermal conditions in aquatic systems are driven by on-going human-induced climate change, hydrological, regional and structural factors. Here, we quantified the impact of instream impoundments on the natural longitudinal connectivity and estimated thermal vulnerability of catchments based on the functional relationship between changing temperature and the profile gradient of rivers in the eastern portion of South Africa. We identified catchments that are most vulnerable to thermal stress based on cold-water adapted species' tolerance to thermal changes. More than half of all studied catchments include rivers that are relatively intact longitudinally, with notable exceptions being rivers in the central portion of the study area. Thermal condition of high elevation sites is more heavily impacted by impoundments and consequently thermal vulnerability of these sites are higher. Blephariceridae and Notonemouridae, the most thermophobic families, are likely to become locally threatened or extinct, in the absence of connectivity. The quantification of stream connectivity and vulnerability of organisms to thermal changes in river systems are important decision making tools for effective adaptive and holistic conservation planning strategies.

AB Climate change is expected to alter hydrological and biogeochemical processes in high-latitude inland waters. A critical question for understanding contemporary and future responses to environmental change is how the spatio-temporal dynamics of runoff generation processes will be affected. We sampled stable water isotopes in soils, lakes and rivers on an unprecedented spatio-temporal scale along a 1700 km transect over three years in the Western Siberia Lowlands. Our findings suggest that snowmelt mixes with, and displaces, large volumes of water stored in the organic soils and lakes to generate runoff during the thaw season. Furthermore, we saw a persistent hydrological connection between water bodies and the landscape across permafrost regions. Our findings help to bridge the understanding between small and large scale hydrological studies in high-latitude systems. These isotope data provide a means to conceptualise hydrological connectivity in permafrost and wetland influenced regions, which is needed for an improved understanding of future biogeochemical changes.

AB Plant roots activity affect the exchanges of mass and energy between the soil and atmosphere. However, it is challenging to monitor the activity of the root-zone because roots are not visible from the soil surface, and root systems undergo spatial and temporal variations in response to internal and external conditions. Therefore, measurements of the activity of root systems are interesting to ecohydrologists in general, and are especially important for specific applications, such as irrigation water management. This study demonstrates the use of small scale three-dimensional (3-D) electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) to monitor the root-zone of orange trees irrigated by two different regimes: (i) full rate, in which 100% of the crop evapotranspiration (ETc) is provided; and (ii) partial root-zone drying (PRD), in which 50% of ETc is supplied to alternate sides of the tree. We performed time-lapse 3-D ERT measurements on these trees from 5 June to 24 September 2015, and compared the long-term and short-term changes before, during, and after irrigation events. Given the small changes in soil temperature and pore water electrical conductivity, we interpreted changes of soil electrical resistivity from 3-D ERT data as proxies for changes in soil water content. The ERT results are consistent with measurements of transpiration flux and soil temperature. The changes in electrical resistivity obtained from ERT measurements in this case study indicate that root water uptake (RWU) processes occur at the 0.1 m scale, and highlight the impact of different irrigation schemes.

AB River basin aquifers are common sites for drinking water wells as bank filtration can be a cost effective pretreatment technology. A groundwater vulnerability to pollution depends on a groundwater mean residence time and on a relative contribution of river water versus local precipitation to groundwater. Environmental isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen (delta O-18 and delta H-2), tritium (H-3) and concentrations of nitrate (NO3-) were used to investigate hydrological pathways, mean residence time and interactions between surface water and groundwater in the Ljubljansko polje aquifer system in Slovenia. (delta O-18 and delta H-2 values indicate a spatial variability of the influence of individual groundwater sources inside the aquifer - local precipitation and the Sava River water. Fractions of river water in groundwater depend on the depth of perforated screens in the pumping wells and their distance from the Sava River. It was estimated that groundwater at wells Klece 11, Hrastje 3, and Hrastje 8 is mostly composed of recently infiltrated local precipitation, while the Sava River is the dominant source of groundwater at the well jarski prod 1. Groundwater at wells Klece 8, Klece 12, and jarski prod 3 contains on average between 41% and 48% of the Sava River water. The H-3 and H-3/He-3 methods indicate short mean residence time of groundwater present at jarski prod (2-7 years) and Hrastje (7-8 years). A small fraction (<10%) of old groundwater is present at Klece. Furthermore, infiltration of local precipitation influenced the levels of NO3- at Hrastje. These data extend our understanding of groundwater flow in the Ljubljansko polje aquifer system, interactions between the Sava River water/local precipitation and groundwater, and the utility of isotope tracers in evaluating the spatial distribution of groundwater vulnerability to pollution.

AB Combined sewer overflow causes severe water pollution, urban flooding and reduced treatment plant efficiency. Understanding the behavior of CSO structures is vital for urban flooding prevention and overflow control. Neural networks have been extensively applied in water resource related fields. In this study, we collect data from an Internet of Things monitoring CSO structure and build different neural network models for simulating and predicting the water level of the CSO structure. Through a comparison of four different neural networks, namely multilayer perceptron (MLP), wavelet neural network (WNN), long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU), the LSTM and GRU present superior capabilities for multi-step-ahead time series prediction. Furthermore, GRU achieves prediction performances similar to LSTM with a quicker learning curve. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The impacts of precipitation and temperature on soil erosion are pronounced in mid-high latitude areas, which lead to seasonal variations in soil erosion. Determining the critical erosion periods and the reasons behind the increased erosion loads are essential for soil management decisions. Hence, integrated approaches combining experiments and modelling based on field investigations were applied to investigate watershed soil erosion characteristics and the dynamics of water movement through soils. Longterm and continuous data for surface runoff and soil erosion variation characteristics of uplands in a watershed were observed via five simulations by the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). In addition, laboratory experiments were performed to quantify the actual soil infiltrabilities in snowmelt seasons (thawed treatment) and rainy seasons (non-frozen treatment). The results showed that over the course of a year, average surface runoff and soil erosion reached peak values of 31.38 mm and 1.46 t ha(-1) a-1, respectively, in the month of April. They also ranked high in July and August, falling in the ranges of 23.73 mm to 24.91 mm and 0.55 t ha(-1) a(-1) to 0.59 t ha(-1) a(-1), respectively. With the infiltration time extended, thawed soils showed lower infiltrabilities than non-frozen soils, and the differences in soil infiltration amounts between these two were considerable. These results highlighted that soil erosion was very closely and positively correlated with surface runoff. Soil loss was higher in snowmelt periods than in rainy periods due to the higher surface runoff in early spring, and the decreased soil infiltrability in snowmelt periods contributed much to this higher surface runoff. These findings are helpful for identification of critical soil erosion periods when making soil management before critical months, especially those before snowmelt periods. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Precipitation is one of the most critical inputs for models used to improve understanding of hydrological processes. In high mountain areas, it is challenging to generate a reliable precipitation data set capturing the spatial and temporal heterogeneity due to the harsh climate, extreme terrain and the lack of observations. This study conducts intensive observation of precipitation in the Mabengnong catchment in the southeast of the Tibetan Plateau during July to August 2013. Because precipitation is greatly influenced by altitude, the observed data are used to characterize the precipitation gradient (PG) and hourly distribution (HD), showing that the average PG is 0.10, 0.28 and 0.26 mm/d/100 m and the average duration is around 0.1, 0.8 and 5.2 h for trace, light and moderate rain, respectively. A distributed biosphere hydrological model based on water and energy budgets with improved physical process for snow (WEB-DHMS) is applied to simulate the hydrological processes with gridded precipitation data derived from a lower altitude meteorological station and the PG and HD characterized for the study area. The observed runoff, MODIS/Terra snow cover area (SCA) data, and MODIS/Terra land surface temperature (LST) data are used for model calibration and validation. Runoff, SCA and LST simulations all show reasonable results. Sensitivity analyses illustrate that runoff is largely underestimated without considering PG, indicating that short-term intensive precipitation observation has the potential to greatly improve hydrological modelling of poorly gauged high mountain catchments.

AB An integrated simulation-optimization (ISO) approach is developed for assessing climate change impacts on water resources. In the ISO, uncertainties presented as both interval numbers and probability distributions can be reflected. Moreover, ISO permits in-depth analyses of various policy scenarios that are associated with different levels of economic consequences when the promised water-allocation targets are violated. A snowmelt-precipitation-driven watershed (Kaidu watershed) in northwest China is selected as the study case for demonstrating the applicability of the proposed method. Results of meteorological projections disclose that the incremental trend of temperature (e.g., minimum and maximum values) and precipitation exist. Results also reveal that (i) the system uncertainties would significantly affect water resources allocation pattern (including target and shortage); (ii) water shortage would be enhanced from 2016 to 2070; and (iii) the more the inflow amount decreases, the higher estimated water shortage rates are. The ISO method is useful for evaluating climate change impacts within a watershed system with complicated uncertainties and helping identify appropriate water resources management strategies hedging against drought.

AB Limestone massifs with a high density of dolines form important karst aquifers in most of the Alps, often with groundwater circulating through deep karst conduits and water coming out of closely spaced springs with flow rates of over some cubic meters per second. Although several hydrogeological studies and tracing experiments were carried out in many of these carbonate mountains in the past, the hydrbgeology of most of these karst aquifers is still poorly known.
   Geological, hydrodynamic and hydrochemical investigations have been carried out in one of the most representative of these areas (Cansiglio-Monte Cavallo, NE Italy) since spring 2015, in order to enhance the knowledge on this important type of aquifer system. Additionally, a cave-to-spring multitracer test was carried out in late spring 2016 by using three different fluorescent tracers. This hydrogeological study allowed: 1) gathering new detailed information on the geological and tectonic structure of such alpine karst plateau; 2) defining discharge rates of the three main springs (Gorgazzo, Santissima, and Molinetto) by constructing rating curves; 3) understanding the discharging behavior of the system with respect to different recharge conditions; 4) better defining the recharge areas of the three springs.
   The three nearby springs (the spring front stretches over 5 km), that drain the investigated karst aquifer system, show different behaviors with respect to changing discharge conditions, demonstrating this aquifer to be divided in partially independent drainage systems under low-flow conditions, when their chemistry is clearly differentiated. Under high-flow conditions, waters discharging at all springs show more similar geochemical characteristics. The combination of geochemistry, hydrodynamic monitoring and dye tracing tests has shown that the three springs have different recharge areas. The study points out that even closely spaced karst springs, that apparently drain the same karst mountain, can have different behaviors, and thus distinctive reactions toward polluting events, a characteristic to be taken into account for their management.

AB Quantifying precipitation (P) partition into evapotranspiration (E) and runoff (Q) is of great importance for global and regional water availability assessment. Budyko framework serves as a powerful tool to make simple and transparent estimation for the partition, using a single parameter, to characterize the shape of the Budyko curve for a "specific basin", where the single parameter reflects the overall effect by not only climatic seasonality, catchment characteristics (e.g., soil, topography and vegetation) but also agricultural activities (e.g., cultivation and irrigation). At the regional scale, these influencing factors are interconnected, and the interactions between them can also affect the single parameter of Budyko-type equations' estimating. Here we employ the multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) model to estimate the Budyko curve shape parameter (n in the Choudhury's equation, one form of the Budyko framework) of the selected 96 catchments across China using a data set of long-term averages for climatic seasonality, catchment characteristics and agricultural activities. Results show average storm depth (ASD), vegetation coverage (M), and seasonality index of precipitation (SI) are three statistically significant factors affecting the Budyko parameter. More importantly, four pairs of interactions are recognized by the MARS model as: The interaction between CA (percentage of cultivated land area to total catchment area) and ASD shows that the cultivation can weaken the reducing effect of high ASD (>46.78 mm) on the Budyko parameter estimating. Drought (represented by the value of Palmer drought severity index <-0.74) and uneven distribution of annual rainfall (represented by the value of coefficient of variation of precipitation > 0.23) tend to enhance the Budyko parameter reduction by large SI (>0.797). Low vegetation coverage (34.56%) is likely to intensify the rising effect on evapotranspiration ratio by IA (percentage of irrigation area to total catchment area). The Budyko n values estimated by the MARS model reproduce the calculated ones by the observation well for the selected 96 catchments (with R = 0.817, MAE = 4.09). Compared to the multiple stepwise regression model estimating the parameter n taken the influencing factors as independent inputs, the MARS model enhances the capability of the Budyko framework for assessing water availability at regional scale using readily available data.

AB The objective of this study is to comprehensively evaluate the new Ensemble Multi-Satellite Precipitation Dataset using the Dynamic Bayesian Model Averaging scheme (EMSPD-DBMA) at daily and 0.25 degrees scales from 2001 to 2015 over the Tibetan Plateau (TP). Error analysis against gauge observations revealed that EMSPD-DBMA captured the spatiotemporal pattern of daily precipitation with an acceptable Correlation Coefficient (CC) of 0.53 and a Relative Bias (RB) of -8.28%. Moreover, EMSPD-DBMA outperformed IMERG and GSMaP-MVK in almost all metrics in the summers of 2014 and 2015, with the lowest RB and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values of -2.88% and 8.01 mm/d, respectively. It also better reproduced the Probability Density Function (PDF) in terms of daily rainfall amount and estimated moderate and heavy rainfall better than both IMERG and GSMaP-MVK. Further, hydrological evaluation with the Coupled Routing and Excess STorage (CREST) model in the Upper Yangtze River region indicated that the EMSPD-DBMA forced simulation showed satisfying hydrological performance in terms of streamflow prediction, with Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of Efficiency (NSE) values of 0.82 and 0.58, compared to gauge forced simulation (0.88 and 0.60) at the calibration and validation periods, respectively. EMSPD-DBMA also performed a greater fitness for peak flow simulation than a new Multi-Source Weighted-Ensemble Precipitation Version 2 (MSWEP V2) product, indicating a promising prospect of hydrological utility for the ensemble satellite precipitation data. This study belongs to early comprehensive evaluation of the blended multi-satellite precipitation data across the TP, which would be significant for improving the DBMA algorithm in regions with complex terrain.

AB Human activities and climate change have altered the spatial and temporal distribution of water availability which is a principal prerequisite for allocation of different water resources. In order to quantify the impacts of climate change and human activities on water availability and optimal allocation of water resources, hydrological models and optimal water resource allocation models should be integrated. Given that increasing human water demand and varying water availability conditions necessitate adaptation measures, we propose a framework to assess the effects of these measures on optimal allocation of water resources. The proposed model and framework were applied to a case study of the middle and lower reaches of the Hanjiang River Basin in China. Two representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios (RCP2.6 and RCP4.5) were employed to project future climate, and the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrological model was used to simulate the variability of flows under historical (1956-2011) and future (2012-2099) conditions. The water availability determined by simulating flow with the VIC hydrological model was used to establish the optimal water resources allocation model. The allocation results were derived under an extremely dry year (with an annual average water flow frequency of 95%), a very dry year (with an annual average water flow frequency of 90%), a dry year (with an annual average water flow frequency of 75%), and a normal year (with an annual average water flow frequency of 50%) during historical and future periods. The results show that the total available water resources in the study area and the inflow of the Danjiangkou Reservoir will increase in the future. However, the uneven distribution of water availability will cause water shortage problems, especially in the boundary areas. The effects of adaptation measures, including water saving, and dynamic control of flood limiting water levels (FLWLs) for reservoir operation, were assessed and implemented to alleviate water shortages. The negative impacts from the South-to-North Water Transfer Project (Middle Route) in the mid-lower reaches of the Hanjiang River Basin can be avoided through the dynamic control of FLWLs in Danjiangkou Reservoir, under the historical and future RCP2.6 and RCP4.5 scenarios. However, the effects of adaptation measures are limited due to their own constraints, such as the characteristics of the reservoirs influencing the FLWLs. The utilization of storm water appears necessary to meet future water demand. Overall, the results indicate that the framework for assessing the effects of adaptation measures on water resources allocation might aid water resources management, not only in the study area but also in other places where water availability conditions vary due to climate change and human activities.

AB In landscapes with low residence times (e.g., rivers and reservoirs), baseflow nutrient concentration dynamics during sensitive timeframes can contribute to deleterious environmental conditions downstream. This study assessed upland and in-stream controls on baseflow nutrient concentrations in a low-gradient, tile-drained agroecosystem watershed. We conducted time-series analysis using Empirical mode decomposition of seven decade-long nutrient concentration time-series in the agricultural Upper Big Walnut Creek watershed (Ohio, USA). Four tributaries of varying drainage areas and three main-stem sites were monitored, and nutrient grab samples were collected weekly from 2006 to 2016 and analyzed for dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP), nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP). Statistically significant seasonal fluctuations were compared with seasonality of baseflow, watershed characteristics (e.g., tile-drain density), and in-stream water quality parameters (pH, DO, temperature). Findings point to statistically significant seasonality of all parameters with peak P concentrations in summer and peak N in late winter-early spring. Results suggest that upland processes exert strong control on DRP concentrations in the winter and spring months, while coupled upland and in-stream conditions control watershed baseflow DRP concentrations during summer and early fall. Conversely, upland flow sources driving streamflow exert strong control on baseflow NO3-N, and in stream attenuation through transient and permanent pathways impacts the magnitude of removal. Regarding TN and TP, we found that TN was governed by NO3-N, while TP was governed by DRP in summer and fluvial erosion of P-rich benthic sediments during higher baseflow conditions. Findings of the study highlight the importance of coupled in-stream and upland management for mitigating eutrophic conditions during environmentally sensitive timeframes. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Following the launch of the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Core Observatory, two advanced high resolution multi-satellite precipitation products namely, Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) and Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP) version 6 are released. A critical evaluation of these newly released precipitation data sets is very important for both the end users and data developers. This study provides a comprehensive assessment of IMERG research product and GSMaP estimates over India at a daily scale for the southwest monsoon season (June to September 2014). The GPM-based precipitation products are inter-compared with widely used TRMM Multi satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA), and gauge-based observations over India. Results show that the IMERG estimates represent the mean monsoon rainfall and its variability more realistically than the gauge-adjusted TMPA and GSMaP data. However, GSMaP has relatively smaller root-mean-square error than IMERG and TMPA, especially over the low mean rainfall regimes and along the west coast of India. An entropy-based approach is employed to evaluate the distributions of the selected precipitation products. The results indicate that the distribution of precipitation in IMERG and GSMaP has been improved markedly, especially for low precipitation rates. IMERG shows a clear improvement in missed and false precipitation bias over India. However, all the three satellite-based rainfall estimates show exceptionally smaller correlation coefficient, larger RMSE, larger negative total bias and hit bias over the northeast India where precipitation is dominated by orographic effects. Similarly, the three satellite-based estimates show larger false precipitation over the southeast peninsular India which is a rain-shadow region. The categorical verification confirms that these satellite-based rainfall estimates have difficulties in detection of rain over the southeast peninsula and northeast India. These preliminary results need to be confirmed in other monsoon seasons in future studies when the fully GPM-based IMERG retrospectively processed data prior to 2014 are available.

AB Scenario-neutral approaches are being used increasingly for climate impact assessments, as they allow water resource system performance to be evaluated independently of climate change projections. An important element of these approaches is the generation of perturbed series of hydrometeorological variables that form the inputs to hydrologic and water resource assessment models, with most scenario-neutral studies to-date considering only shifts in the average and a limited number of other statistics of each climate variable. In this study, a stochastic generation approach is used to perturb not only the average of the relevant hydrometeorological variables, but also attributes such as the intermittency and extremes. An optimization-based inverse approach is developed to obtain hydrometeorological time series with uniform coverage across the possible ranges of rainfall attributes (referred to as the 'exposure space'). The approach is demonstrated on a widely used rainfall generator, WGEN, for a case study at Adelaide, Australia, and is shown to be capable of producing evenly-distributed samples over the exposure space. The inverse approach expands the applicability of the scenario-neutral approach in evaluating a water resource system's sensitivity to a wider range of plausible climate change scenarios.

AB Extreme rainfall is quantified in engineering practice using Intensity-Duration-Frequency curves (IDF) that are traditionally derived from rain-gauges and more recently also from remote sensing instruments, such as weather radars. These instruments measure rainfall at different spatial scales: rain-gauge samples rainfall at the point scale while weather radar averages precipitation on a relatively large area, generally around 1 km(2). As such, a radar derived IDF curve is representative of the mean areal rainfall over a given radar pixel and neglects the within-pixel rainfall variability. In this study, we quantify subpixel variability of extreme rainfall by using a novel space-time rainfall generator (STREAP model) that downscales in space the rainfall within a given radar pixel. The study was conducted using a unique radar data record (23 years) and a very dense rain-gauge network in the Eastern Mediterranean area (northern Israel). Radar-1DF curves, together with an ensemble of point-based IDF curves representing the radar subpixel extreme rainfall variability, were developed fitting Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distributions to annual rainfall maxima. It was found that the mean areal extreme rainfall derived from the radar underestimate most of the extreme values computed for point locations within the radar pixel (on average, similar to 70%). The subpixel variability of rainfall extreme was found to increase with longer return periods and shorter durations (e.g. from a maximum variability of 10% for a return period of 2 years and a duration of 4 h to 30% for 50 years return period and 20 min duration). For the longer return periods, a considerable enhancement of extreme rainfall variability was found when stochastic (natural) climate variability was taken into account. Bounding the range of the subpixel extreme rainfall derived from radar-IDF can be of major importance for different applications that require very local estimates of rainfall extremes.

AB Flooding induced by heavy precipitation is one of the most severe natural hazards in alpine catchments. To accurately predict such events, accurate and representative precipitation data are required. Estimating catchment precipitation is, however, difficult due to its high spatial, and, in the mountains, elevation dependent variability. These inaccuracies, together with runoff model limitations, translate into uncertainty in runoff estimates. Thus, in this study, we investigate the value of three precipitation datasets, commonly used in hydrological studies, i.e., station network precipitation (SNP), interpolated grid precipitation (IGP) and radar-based precipitation (RBP), for flood predictions in an alpine catchment. To quantify their effects on runoff simulations, we perform a Bayesian uncertainty analysis with an improved description of model systematic errors. By using periods of different lengths for model calibration, we explore the information content of these three datasets for runoff predictions. Our results from an alpine catchment showed that using SNP resulted in the largest predictive uncertainty and the lowest model performance evaluated by the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency. This performance improved from 0.674 to 0.774 with IGP, and to 0.829 with RBP. The latter two datasets were also much more informative than SNP, as half as many calibration data points were required to obtain a good model performance. Thus, our results show that the various types of precipitation data differ in their value for flood predictions in an alpine catchment and indicate RBP as the most useful dataset.

AB The classification of rainfall fields has mainly focused on the split between convective and stratiform rainfall fields. In the present case study, the wavelet-based scattering transform is used to classify rainfall events observed by a weather radar. This very recent method has, to the best of the authors' knowledge, not yet been applied for such a purpose. This method considers the spatial properties of rainfall radar images. This case study regroups 34 rainfall periods recorded over the Nantes region (western France) during 23 days in both 2009 and 2012. These periods display different characteristics in terms of duration and type of rainfall field. A reference configuration of the scattering transform has been evaluated and compared to various configurations in order to approximate the application conditions most appropriate to this case study. This evaluation is performed-by a leave-one-out cross validation. A global accuracy of 93.5 6 of well classified images is obtained in the reference conditions which is an encouraging result. The temporal sampling of the rainfall fields is an important aspect of the classification process. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The goal of this study is the evaluation of the skill of five state-of-the-art numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems [European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), UK Met Office (UKMO), National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), China Meteorological Administration (CMA), and Canadian Meteorological Center (CMC)] in forecasting rainfall from North Atlantic tropical cyclones (TCs). Analyses focus on 15 North Atlantic TCs that made landfall along the U.S. coast over the 2007-2012 period. As reference data we use gridded rainfall provided by the Climate Prediction Center (CPC). We consider forecast lead-times up to five days. To benchmark the skill of these models, we consider rainfall estimates from one radar-based (Stage IV) and four satellite-based [Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission - Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA, both real-time and research version); Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN); the CPC MORPHing Technique (CMORPH)] rainfall products. Daily and storm total rainfall fields from each of these remote sensing products are compared to the reference data to obtain information about the range of errors we can expect from "observational data." The skill of the NWP models is quantified: (1) by visual examination of the distribution of the errors in storm total rainfall for the different lead-times, and numerical examination of the first three moments of the error distribution; (2) relative to climatology at the daily scale. Considering these skill metrics, we conclude that the NWP models can provide skillful forecasts of TC rainfall with lead-times up to 48 h, without a consistently best or worst NWP model.

AB This study proposes a wavelet-based multi-resolution modeling approach for statistical downscaling of GCM variables to mean monthly precipitation for five locations at Krishna Basin, India. Climatic dataset from NCEP is used for training the proposed models (Jan.'69 to Dec.'94) and are applied to corresponding CanCM4 GCM variables to simulate precipitation for the validation (Jan.'95-Dec.'05) and forecast (Jan.' 06 Dec.'35) periods. The observed precipitation data is obtained from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) gridded precipitation product at 0.25 degree spatial resolution. This paper proposes a novel Multi-Scale Wavelet Entropy (MWE) based approach for clustering climatic variables into suitable clusters using k-means methodology. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to obtain the representative Principal Components (PC) explaining 90-95% variance for each cluster. A multi-resolution non-linear approach combining Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Second Order Volterra (SoV) is used to model the representative PCs to obtain the downscaled precipitation for each downscaling location (W-P-SoV model). The results establish that wavelet-based multi-resolution SoV models perform significantly better compared to the traditional Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) based frameworks. It is observed that the proposed MWE-based clustering and subsequent PCA, helps reduce the dimensionality of the input climatic variables, while capturing more variability compared to stand-alone k-means (no MWE). The proposed models perform better in estimating the number of precipitation events during the non-monsoon periods whereas the models with clustering without MWE over-estimate the rainfall during the dry season.

AB Understanding the relationships between extreme daily and sub-daily rainfall events and their governing factors is important in order to analyse the properties of extreme rainfall events in a changing climate. Atmospheric temperature is one of the dominant climate variables which has a strong relationship with extreme rainfall events. In this study, a temperature-rainfall binning technique is used to evaluate the dependency of extreme rainfall on daily maximum temperature. The Clausius-Clapeyron (C-C) relation was found to describe the relationship between daily maximum temperature and a range of rainfall durations from 6 min up to 24 h for seven Australian weather stations, the stations being located in Adelaide, Brisbane, Canberra, Darwin, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney. The analysis shows that the rainfall-temperature scaling varies with location, temperature and rainfall duration. The Darwin Airport station shows a negative scaling relationship, while the other six stations show a positive relationship. To identify the trend in scaling relationship over time the same analysis is conducted using data covering 10 year periods. Results indicate that the dependency of extreme rainfall on temperature also varies with the analysis period. Further, this dependency shows an increasing trend for more extreme short duration rainfall and a decreasing trend for average long duration rainfall events at most stations. Seasonal variations of the scale changing trends were analysed by categorizing the summer and autumn seasons in one group and the winter and spring seasons in another group. Most of 99th percentile of 6 min, 1 h and 24 h rain durations at Perth, Melbourne and Sydney stations show increasing trend for both groups while Adelaide and Darwin show decreasing trend. Furthermore, majority of scaling trend of 50th percentile are decreasing for both groups. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study presents a three-step validation technique to compare the performance of the Canadian Precipitation Analysis (CaPA) product relative to actual observation as a hydrologic forcing in regional watershed simulation. CaPA is an interpolated (6 h or 24 h accumulation) reanalysis precipitation product in near real time covering all of North America. The analysis procedure involves point-to-point (P2P) and map-to-map (M2M) comparisons, followed by proxy validation using an operational version of the WATFLOOD (TM) hydrologic model from 2002 to 2005 in the Lake Winnipeg Basin (LWB), Canada. The P2P technique using a Bayesian change point analysis shows that CaPA corresponds with actual observations (Canadian daily climate data, CDCD), on both an annual and seasonal basis. CaPA has the same spatial pattern, dependency and autocorrelation properties as CDCD pixel by pixel (M2M). When used as hydrologic forcing in WATFLOOD (TM), results indicate that CaPA is a reliable product for water resource modeling and predictions, but that the quality of CaPA data varies annually and seasonally, as does the quality of observations. CaPA proved most beneficial as a hydrologic forcing during winter seasons where observation quality is the lowest. Reanalysis products, such as CaPA, can be a reliable option in sparse network areas, and is beneficial for regional governments when the cost of new weather stations is prohibitive.

AB The recent technological advances in electron microscopes, detectors, as well as image processing and reconstruction software have brought single particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) into prominence for determining structures of bio-molecules at near atomic resolution. This has been particularly true for virus capsids, ribosomes, and other large assemblies, which have been the ideal specimens for structural studies by cryo-EM approaches. An analysis of time series metadata of virus structures on the methods of structure determination, resolution of the structures, and size of the virus particles revealed a rapid increase in the virus structures determined by cryo-EM at near atomic resolution since 2010. In addition, the data highlight the median resolution (similar to 3.0 angstrom) and size (similar to 310.0 angstrom in diameter) of the virus particles determined by X-ray crystallography while no such limits exist for cryo-EM structures, which have a median diameter of 508 angstrom. Notably, cryo-EM virus structures in the last four years have a median resolution of 3.9 angstrom. Taken together with minimal sample requirements, not needing diffraction quality crystals, and being able to achieve similar resolutions of the crystal structures makes cryo-EM the method of choice for current and future virus capsid structure determinations.

AB Laying hens develop a type of osteoporosis that arises from a loss of structural bone, resulting in high incidence of fractures. In this study, a comparison of bone material properties was made for lines of hens created by divergent selection to have high and low bone strength and housed in either individual cages, with restricted mobility, or in an aviary system, with opportunity for increased mobility. Improvement of bone biomechanics in the high line hens and in aviary housing was mainly due to increased bone mass, thicker cortical bone and more medullary bone. However, bone material properties such as cortical and medullary bone mineral composition and crystallinity as well as collagen maturity did not differ between lines. However, bone material properties of birds from the different type of housing were markedly different. The cortical bone in aviary birds had a lower degree of mineralization and bone mineral was less mature and less organized than in caged birds. These differences can be explained by increased bone turnover rates due to the higher physical activity of aviary birds that stimulates bone formation and bone remodeling. Multivariate statistical analyses shows that both cortical and medullary bone contribute to breaking strengthThe cortical thickness was the single most important contributor while its degree of mineralization and porosity had a smaller contribution. Bone properties had poorer correlations with mechanical properties in cage birds than in aviary birds presumably due to the greater number of structural defects of cortical bone in cage birds.

AB Cryo-correlative light and electron microscopy (cryo-CLEM) offers a unique way to analyze the high-resolution structural information of cryo-vitrified specimen by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) with the guide of the search for unique events by cryo-fluorescence microscopy (cryo-FM). To achieve cryo-FM, a trade-off must be made between the temperature and performance of objective lens. The temperature of specimen should be kept below devitrification while the distance between the objective lens and specimen should be short enough for high resolution imaging. Although special objective lens was designed in many current cryo-FM approaches, the unavoided frosting and ice contamination are still affecting the efficiency of cryo-CLEM. In addition, the correlation accuracy between cryo-FM and cryo-EM would be reduced during the current specimen transfer procedure. Here, we report an improved cryo-CLEM technique thigh-vacuum optical platform for cryo-CLEM, HOPE) based on a high-vacuum optical stage and a commercial cryo-EM holder. The HOPE stage comprises of a special adapter to suit the cryo-EM holder and a high-vacuum chamber with an anti-contamination system. It provides a clean and enduring environment for cryo specimen, while the normal dry objective lens in room temperature can be used via the optical windows. The 'touch-free' specimen transfer via cryo-EM holder allows least specimen deformation and thus maximizes the correlation accuracy between cryo-FM and cryo-EM. Besides, we developed a software to perform semi-automatic cryo-EM acquisition of the target region localized by cryo-FM. Our work provides a new solution for cryo-CLEM and can be adapted for different commercial fluorescence microscope and electron microscope.

AB The single crystalline alpha-Fe2O3 nanorhombohedrons are synthesized by a facile solvothermal method followed with a subsequent annealing process. As-fabricated alpha-Fe2O3 nanorhombohedrons based sensor exhibits ultrafast response and recovery time (< 1 s/< 1 s), excellent selectivity and high response towards trimethylamine (TMA). Excellent gas sensing properties can be attributed to cooperative effect of unique nanorhombohedrons structure and rapid electron exchange between Fe3+ and Fe2+ ions. In addition, a possible growth mechanism is proposed. The excellent sensing properties and facile synthesis method make as-prepared alpha-Fe2O3 nanorhombohedrons a promising candidate for TMA detecting application. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Bismuth tungstate/lotus fiber composite membrane (Bi2WO6/LF) were prepared. The composite membranes were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectrum (EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The photocatalytic activity of Bi2WO6/LF under visible light irradiation was investigated. The result shows that photocatalytic activity of the Bi2WO6/LF increase with the rise of Bi2WO6 content in the composite membrane. Bi2WO6/LF with 1% Bi2WO6 possesses excellent photocatalytic activity for methylene blue and degradation efficiency of methylene blue reach 94% after irradiation for 270 min. Bi2WO6/LF could be potentially applied in sewage disposal and environmental remediation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, Cu2ZnSn(Se,S)(4) (CZTSSe) thin films were deposited by using ammonium polysulfoselenide-based ink through ultrasonic spray pyrolysis (USP) process. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) reveals that deposition and pre-annealing with appropriate temperature were necessary to be implemented to evaporate the excess S and retain the Se for the precursor thin films. The CZTSSe thin films were obtained by annealing in nitrogen atmosphere without extra Se source. X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) detection and band gap estimation indicate that the ratios of S/(S + Se) for the prepared films can be modulated by adjusting the Se concentration of the ink. As the Se concentration of the adopted ink increased from 0.025 to 0.125 M, the ratios of S/(S + Se) for the prepared films decreased from 0.88 to 0.39, and the band gap shrunk from 1.43 to 1.16 eV.

AB A novel route to prepare Al2O3 hollow microspheres with a diameter of about 6 mu m is presented by the way of using CaMg(CO3)(2) microspheres as the recyclable sacrifice-template and aqueous solution of Mg (NO3)(2) and Ca(NO3)(2) as dispersant. The dispersant can not only control the reaction rate of ion-exchange to synthesize Al2O3 hollow microspheres, but also act as a reactant to recycle the templates. Moreover, the as-obtained Al2O3 hollow microspheres possessed a surface area of 214.8 m(2) g(-1) and a pore volume of 0.9117 cm(3) g(-1), which are higher than many reported porous Al2O3 materials. These advantages make this route economical and efficient to prepare Al2O3 hollow microspheres, and promising in large-scale preparation of other metal oxides hollow structures.

AB This work presents the light transmission through a collection of solid cellular polymers based on poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) with cells sizes covering the micro and nano-scale. The obtained results showed that the behavior of light transmission when cell size is in the nano-scale is opposite to the one shown by microcellular foams or the one predicted by theoretical models of light scattering (LS). In fact, the expected trend is that a reduction of cell size increases the opacity of the samples. However, for nanocellular polymers based on amorphous polymers reducing the cell size increases the light transmission. Therefore, this result indicates that a further reduction of the cell size could result in cellular polymers optically semi-transparent. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this paper, we have applied a triple laser scanning strategy, which incorporates a first laser scan to heat the substrate, a second laser scan to produce amorphous coating, followed immediately by a third laser scan to in-situ release the thermal stress formed within the amorphous coating, to prevent the generation of crack during the laser cladding of an Fe37.5Cr27.5C12B13Mo10 amorphous coating. The microstructure and wear resistance of the crack-free Fe-based amorphous coating were also examined. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The Cu2Se film was constructed by novel nanowire networks with length up to 50 mm. The obtained product was characterized by XRD, SEM, HRTEM, Raman, and XPS techniques, revealing that Cu2Se nanowire possessed single-crystal structures. The shape of Cu2Se film changed from nanowire networks to perfect microflowers as the amount of CTAB increased. Such Cu2Se film may have great potential applications in biomedical engineering, sensors, and catalysis. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Magnetic Fe2C nanorods were successfully synthesized by the carbonization of iron-based metal-organic framework (MOF) template and examined as photocatalyst for water oxidation reaction. An apparent turnover frequency (TOF) of 2.73 x 10(-3) s(-1) and oxygen yield of 20.64% were obtained with Fe2C in an alkalescent aqueous solution. The rod-like Fe2C materials is convenient to recovery and recycling of the catalyst for water oxidation. The surface conditions of the Fe2C also remain unchanged after the photocatalytic reaction, as confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Our work demonstrates that Fe2C as efficient WOCs is a promising candidate for water oxidation. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Here, we reported the synthesis of bilayered BiFeO3/CoFe2O4 nano-hollow spheres (NHSs) by depositing a BiFeO3 (BFO) layer of thickness similar to 20 nm on CoFe2O4 (CFO) nano-hollow spheres surface of diameter similar to 250 nm and investigated their electric, magnetic and magnetoelectric properties in view of their applications in electronic and magnetic devices. The nano-composites exhibit better properties compared to their individual counterpart. The maximum polarization in CFO/BFO NHSs is found to be 2.1 mu C/cm(2) at a frequency 50 Hz. Magnetic measurements show the saturation magnetization to be 30.1 emu/g with high value of remnant magnetization (17.9 emu/g), and coercivity (1320 Oe). Its magnetoelectric coefficient, alpha(ME) at 1 kHz is estimated to be similar to 8.6 mV/cm Oe. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB In this work, we systematically investigated the hardness, electrical resistance and thermal stability of nanocrystalline NbMoTaW high entropy alloy films with thickness varying from about 100 to 2000 nm. The nanocrystalline high entropy alloy film exhibited the peak hardness (similar to 16.0 GPa), strong size-independent electrical resistance (similar to 170 mu Omega.cm) as well as stabilized single phase body-centered cubic (BCC) structure even after exposed to vacuum annealing at 800 degrees C for 2 h. In the meantime, we provide reasonable insights into understanding behaviors above. With superior mechanical and electrical properties as well as good thermal stability, this kind of refractory nanocrystalline HEAFs will find extensive potential applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Nanostructure Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) thin films were synthesized by Successive Ionic Layer Adsorption and Reaction (SILAR) method. The as-grown CZTS thin films have shown amorphous structure but after sulfurization at 450 degrees C temperature, CZTS thin films showed kesterite crystalline structure. The crystallite size of annealed CZTS thin films is to be similar to 18 nm and kesterite structure was confirmed by XRD pattern and Raman spectra show pure CZTS peaks at 337 cm(-1) and 368 cm(-1). The FE-SEM images indicate the presence of small agglomerated grains & visible white pores of as grown and annealed samples. The direct band gap energy of CZTS thin films was decreased after annealing under sulfur atmosphere. CZTS thin films have suitable absorber material for solar cells confirmed by structural, optical and morphological properties. CdS quantum dot has been used as a window layer to deposit on Indium doped tin oxide (ITO) & Fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates for measured power conversion efficiency of CZTS material confirmed by J-V characteristics.

AB Cu2O coated meshes with "coral reef-like" micro/nanostructures have been successfully fabricated via a facile spray-and-dry method, without using low surface energy materials. The obtained Cu2O coated superhydrophobic surface, which is similar to the "lotus leaf" structure, had a contact angle of 159.6 degrees and a sliding angle of 1 degrees. Based on the design of a miniature apparatus, the superhydrophobic mesh can separate different kinds of oils regardless of the light oil or heavy oil in the mixture with excellent separation efficiency. It is expected that this convenient technique may open a novel approach in future development of superhydrophobic coating technology. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DT Article
DE Thermal stability; Nanocrystalline; Magnesium; Mechanical alloying
AB Nanocrystalline metals are often strong but with a low thermal stability. In this study, a bulk nanocrystalline Mg-1.5at% Ti alloy with a high thermal stability is successfully fabricated by mechanical alloying and subsequent high-temperature/high-pressure consolidation. The rapid grain growth of nanocrystalline Mg and Mg-1.5at% Ti alloy starts at similar to 100 degrees C (0.40 T-m) and 450 degrees C (0.78 T-m), respectively. The high thermal stability of nanocrystalline Mg-1.5at% Ti alloy can be attributed to the segregation of Ti atoms at grain boundaries.

ID NANOINDENTATION BEHAVIOR; ALLOY; DEFORMATION; CU
AB In this study, Mg single crystals (99.99% purity) were subjected to focused ion beam (FIB) bombardment perpendicular and parallel to the c-axis of the hexagonal close packed (HCP) lattice respectively. The research results indicate that the {10 - 12} twin nucleation induced by FIB micro-stress in magnesium single crystal is dependent on the applied ion current and the crystal orientation. The incident Ga+ ions dose increases with ion current, which would enhance the FIB loading micro-stress. And when the FIB incident direction is parallel to the close-packed (0001) plane, there would be more ion-atom interactions during FIB bombardment. Both processing mechanisms could lead to larger precipitate-matrix misfit area and further microstructure damage, which might eventually facilitate {10 - 12} twin nucleation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3 (NBT) and Na0.5Bi0.49Er0.01TiO3 (Er3+: NBT) single crystals with size of Phi 12 x 50 mm(2) were grown by the melt-Bridgman method. The dielectric permittivities of NBT and Er3+: NBT are 770 and 700 at 10 kHz, respectively. Meanwhile, the dielectric losses are 4.7% and 4.4%, respectively. The Er3+ dopant only leads to the slight decreasing of dielectric permittivity, dielectric loss and transmittance of NBT crystal. The cut-off edges of both NBT and Er3+: NBT are located at 410 nm. Curie temperatures of NBT and Er3+: NBT are located at 336 degrees C and 312 degrees C, respectively. Er3+: NBT crystal presents extremely bright upconversation emission (lambda(em) = 548 nm) under 980 nm near-infrared excitation. NBT single crystal as host shows an apparent advantage on the up-conversion emission properties, which can be potentially used as a multifunctional device by integrating its up-conversion and piezoelectric properties.

AB Novel co-crystal microwires based on phenothiazine (PTZ) and tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) have been fabricated using a facile solution method and fully characterized. The microwires had well-defined shapes, smooth surfaces and high crystalline. Moreover, the co-crystal microwires exhibited a significant absorption at wavelengths between 900 and 2400 nm owing to the charge-transfer interaction between PTZ and TCNQ. The prototype field-effect transistor with the bottom-gate was directly constructed, exhibiting typical ambipolar charge transport characteristics. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Iron powder (IP) was modified by silane coupling agent to form coupling agent funtionalized iron powder (CIP). Then surfactant polyvinylpyrrolidone was adsorbed onto the surface of CIP. Finally, the aniline was polymerized onto CIP surface. Polyaniline (PANI) shell was formed on metal iron surface and it was verified by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterization. The PANI-CIP core-shell nanoparticles were used as fillers within poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF) to prepare the (PANI-CIP)-PVDF dielectric composites. The dielectric constant of (PANI-CIP)-PVDF was obviously larger than that of IP-PVDF composite. 20%-(PANI-CIP)-PVDF showed high dielectric constant of 72.35 at 0.1 Hz, which was almost 3.5 times larger than that of 20%- IP-PVDF.

AB Generally, metallic alloys adaptive to selective laser melting (SLM) need to meet three basic physical properties, i.e. relatively high laser absorptivity, relatively low thermal conductivity, and especially non-containing low boiling point volatile elements. In this work, high-strength Cu-12.5Zn-2.9Si silicon brass, which does not meet these three requirements, was manufactured by SLM from gas-atomized powder. Interestingly, the SLM-manufactured silicon brass has high relative density (98.8%) thereby exhibiting higher strength than that for cast counterpart. Accordingly, this work substantiates, for the first time, the feasibility by SLM to manufacture high-strength metallic alloys with special physical properties. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB The poor dispersion of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in a copper matrix and the weak interfacial bonding between CNTs and the Cu matrix critically hinders the engineering applications of their composites. Herein, we obtained a well-dispersed and tight interfacial bonding between CNTs and Cu matrix in the Cu/CNTs composites fabricated via spark plasma sintering and subsequently hot rolling. Microstructural characterization shows that the small grain size of Cu matrix, the uniform dispersion of CNTs, and the good wettability and interfacial bonding between the CNTs and Cu significantly improved the mechanical properties of the Cu/CNTs composite. This work provides an innovative fabrication process for the development of high performance Cu/CNTs composites with excellent interfacial bonding strength. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Highly dispersed alpha-Al2O3 microplatelets of various sizes and aspect ratios were prepared by additive-assisted molten salt synthesis. The effects of SiO2 and SiO2 + CaO additions on phase formation and morphology development of alpha-Al2O3 particles were investigated. Introducing additives are very effective in controlling alpha-Al2O3 morphology. SiO2 additive significantly enhances shape anisotropy of alpha-Al2O3 platelets, where a particle aspect ratio similar to 23.8 was achieved, about 2.7-6.0 times higher than those of the platelets prepared without additives. When using SiO2 + CaO mixture, low concentration additive facilitates the growth of large platelets (similar to 9.8 mu m), while increasing its content dramatically reduces the platelet size to similar to 3.7 mu m. These findings provide a new insight for the design and synthesis of novel advanced anisotropic microcrystals with improved quality. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A simple one-step method to encapsulate Ni (II) into the pore channels of AlPO-5 molecule sieve was developed by using nickel-amine complexes as templating agent for synthesis of Ni(deta)(2)-AlPO-5. The Ni (II) occluded in the pores can be directly reduced by reducing gases in situ generated from the decomposition of nickel-amine complexes in AlPO-5 during heat treatment. The resulted catalyst has ultrasmall Ni clusters highly dispersed into the pore channels, showing a high selectivity for 1,2-propanediol in the hydrogenolysis of glycerol. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Poly(N-hydroxymethyl acrylamide) was grafted from loofah fibers by surface-initiated activators generated by electron transfer for atom transfer radical polymerization (AGET ATRP) for synergic adsorption of Cd2+ and acid blue 25 (AB25). The adsorption behaviors towards Cd2+ and AB25 in respective single and binary systems were investigated by batch technique. The adsorption capacity of AB25 decreased when the solution pH increased from 1 to 6, but the adsorption capacity of Cd2+ increased with the pH value. In the binary mixture of Cd2+ and AB25, the presence of AB25 significantly enhanced the adsorption capacity of Cd2+, while the adsorption amount of AB25 was not affected by the presence of Cd2+. The functionalized loofah fibers exhibited good reusability and was qualified for practical application. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In situ synthesized WC reinforced iron based composites were prepared on a surface of 45# steel by means of spark plasma sintering and casting. The miscrostructure of this material were investigated with the help of SEM, XRD and microhardness. Results showed that the WC particles were uniformly distributed in the iron matrix on the surface of cast steel. The volume fraction and the mean grain size of WC particles in the composite layer were similar to 28% and 12 mu m, respectively. A perfect metallurgical bonding between the surface composite layer and substrate was generated. From the surface of sample to that of 45# steel (matrix), the hardness decrease gradually. The microhardness of composite layer is about 2.4 times higher than that of 45# steel. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Hindered phenol functionalized graphene oxide (HPFGO) was prepared by grafting 2,6-Di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxymethyl phenol (DBHMP) onto graphene oxide (GO) using isophorone diisocyanate as bridging agent. FT-IR, XPS, XRD and TGA results confirmed the chemical structure of HPFGO. By latex-mixing method, HPFGO was uniformly dispersed in natural rubber (NR) matrix and obviously enhanced the thermal stability. Importantly, HPFGO significantly improved the thermo-oxidative aging resistance of NR vulcanizate, which was attributed to not only the synergistic antioxidative effect between hindered phenol and urethane groups, but also the barrier role of HPFGO sheets to oxygen.

SO MATERIALS LETTERS
LA English
DT Article
DE Structural; Negative Poisson's ratio; Simulation and modelling; Elastic
   properties
AB The microstructure of wood is highly anisotropic, which suggests that this material could exhibit unusual elastic properties. A few studies have suggested the possibility of auxeticity, or negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) in some wood samples. In order to conclusively confirm that wood does show NPR, we have used a combination of geometric modelling, finite element analysis (FEA) and off-axis compression testing. The geometric model indicates that idealised thin-walled wood cell structures should generate NPR of -1, FEA suggests that more realistic cell arrays can attain NPR, to -0.27, and compression tests show that some NPR - to -0.74 - remains in real wood samples. These results could help design "engineeredwood" laminates products with tailored elastic properties. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In order to prepare Polyethersulfone (PES) melt-spun fibers, epoxy (EP) oligomer was adopted as a novel plasticizer. The plasticization of EP on PES was investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and rheological techniques. The results revealed that the glass transition temperature (T-g), the complex viscosity (eta*), and melt processing temperature (T-mp) of PES/EP blends decreased significantly with the increase of EP content. FTIR spectroscopy and rheological behavior demonstrated no signs of crosslinking reactions occurring between PES and EP molecules. Finally, PES melt-spun fibers were successfully obtained by using EP as a plasticizer, showing the highest tensile strength at 2.71 cN/dtex. The morphologies of the fibers observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) presented smooth and uniform surface, and compact fracture. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Carbonate is recently studied as anode material for lithium ion battery due to its relatively high capacity compared to relative oxides. In order to improve the time-efficiency of synthesis, an ultrafast solvothermal process assisted with microwave is carried out to obtain well-constructed Mn0.8Co0.2CO3/graphene composite as anode material for lithium ion batteries. The as-prepared Mn0.8Co0.2CO3/graphene composite with a graphene amount of 17.5 wt% exhibits a morphology of cubic particles in graphene without any impurity. Mn0.8Co0.2CO3/graphene delivers high initial charge capacities of 1033 mAh g(-1). And after 120 cycles, charge/discharge capacities of 737/735 mAh g(-1) are maintained at 0.2 A g(-1). Even at 2 A g(-1), the composite can still deliver high charge/discharge capacities of 500/501 mAh g(-1). It is promising to obtain carbonate/graphene anode materials rapidly through such ultrafast solvothermal process assisted by microwave for application. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A novel microwave dielectric ceramic LiNb0.6Ti0.5O3 (LNT) with Ca substitutions LiNb0.6Ti(0.5-x)Ca1.231xO3 was synthesized by solid-state method. It was found that with Ca substitutions, the temperature coefficient of resonant frequency tau(f) could be adjusted to zero, due to the appearance of the second phase Ca5Nb4Ti3O21. The tau(f) of the Ca5Nb4Ti3O21 phase is -144.3 ppm/degrees C through the simulation and numerical value calculation. Furthermore, the LiNb0.6Ti(0.5-x)Ca1.231xO3 ceramic shows a higher dielectric constant epsilon(r) and a denser microstructure. The LiNb0.6Ti(0.5-x)Ca1.231xO3 ceramic with x = 0.03 sintered at 1100 degrees C for 2 h shows excellent microwave dielectric properties: epsilon(r) = 76.89, Q x f = 4064 GHz, tau(f) = 0.25 ppm/degrees C.

AB A novel yolk-shell structure consisting of an intermetallic Sn-Co core, a carbon shell and void space between the core and shell has been designed and successfully synthesized. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements indicate that the core is SnCo alloy and the shell is amorphous. The yolk-shell structure is observed by scanning electron microscope (SEM). For comparison, carbon encapsulated pure Sn, which also possesses a yolk-shell structure, has been synthesized as well. Electrochemical characterizations reveal that the SnCo@C sample has significantly improved electrochemical reversibility, cycling stability and rate capability than Sn@C. The cobalt in the SnCo alloy is proved to play a critical role of conductive stable matrix to stabilize Sn during sodiation/desodiation process and facilitate the diffusion kinetics of sodium.

Morphological analysis reveals the noodle, seed and particle like structure of GZO for GaN, sapphire and Si substrates respectively with average grain size ranging from 5 to 20 nm. An effective mass model (EM-Model) for particle in a cylindrical wave function of e-h pair was correlated with experimental results. The reduction in FWHM value (from 31 nm to 13 nm) of NBE (near-band-edge) emission peak and enhanced NBE intensity have been achieved with small grain size. Blue shift in optical band gap is explained in term of grain radius by EM-model. Improved optical and structural properties were found in relation with quantum confinement effect. The current study states that grain size plays vital role in order to tailor optical properties of GZO thin films. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Near-infrared luminescence of a novel polymer composite system: PMMA doped with Bi2ZnOB2O6:Nd3+ microparticles, is reported for the first time. Luminescence properties of Bi2ZnOB2O6:Nd3+/PMMA were analyzed on the basis on excitation and emission spectra as well as fluorescence decay profiles. Excitation spectra monitored at 1062 nm (F-4(3/2) -> I-4(11/2)) indicate numerous bands related to the optical transition of Nd3+ ions: from the I-4(9/2) ground state to the n D-4(3/2), P-2(1/2), K-2(15/2), (4)G(7/2) + (4)G(9/2), K-2(13/2), (4)G(5/2) + (2)G(7/2), H-2(11/2), F-4(9/2), F-4(7/2) + S-4(3/2), F-4(5/2) + H-2(9/2), F-4(3/2) excited states. Many of them may be utilized to excite near-infrared emission of Ni3+ ions. In particular, distinctive Nd3+ emissions of the F-4(3/2) -> I-4(9/2) and F-4(3/2) -> I-4(11/2) transitions were detected, under excitation at 514 nm. The fluorescence decay profiles monitored at 1062 nm, excited at 514 nm, show relatively long emission lifetime of the F-4(3/2) -> I-4(11/2) transition equal to 85 mu s. Raman spectroscopy was used to determine vibrational properties and homogeneity of Bi2ZnOB2O6:Nd3+/PMMA composites. The obtained results suggest that Bi2ZnOB2O6:Nd3+/PMMA composite may be applied as an effective source of near-infrared emission in a new integrated optoelectronic devices. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB A method to grow single crystal (SC) yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG) fibers with varied rare-earth ion dopant concentration has been proposed. Crystalline holmium aluminum garnet (HoAG), prepared via sol-gel process, was dip-coated on to previously grown SC YAG fibers. The HoAG coated SC YAG fiber preforms were re-grown to a smaller diameter using the laser heated pedestal growth (LHPG) technique. The final dopant concentration of the re-grown SC fiber was varied by changing the number of HoAG coatings on the preform. 120 mu m diameter SC Ho:YAG fibers with four different dopant concentrations were grown. Lasing was demonstrated at 2.09 gm for these fibers. A maximum of 58.5% optical-to-optical slope efficiency was obtained. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Single crystal needle-like diamonds shaped as rectangular pyramids were produced by combination of chemical vapor deposition and selective oxidation with dimensions and geometrical characteristics depending on the deposition process parameters. Photoluminescence spectra and their dependencies on wavelength of excitation radiation reveal presence of nitrogen- and silicon-vacancy color centers in the diamond crystallites. Photoluminescence spectra, intensity mapping, and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy indicate that silicon-vacancy centers are concentrated at the crystallites apex while nitrogen vacancy centers are distributed over the whole crystallite. Dependence of the photoluminescence on excitation radiation intensity demonstrates saturation and allows estimation of the color centers density. The combination of structural parameters, geometry and photoluminescent characteristics are prospective for advantageous applications of these diamond crystallites in quantum information processing and optical sensing.

AB GaN nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized by carbothermal reduction combined with nitridation, using Ga2O3 powder and graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) as precursors. Characterization of the NPs was performed by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and room-temperature photoluminescence measurements. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was also performed to detect the chemical states of the different species. A universal yellow luminescence (YL) band was observed from complexes of Ga vacancies with 0 anti-sites and of 0 anti-sites with C. Further increments in the C content were observed with continued growth and induced an additional blue luminescence (BL) band. Tuning of the YL and BL bands resulted in white-light emission under certain experimental conditions, thus offering a new way of employing GaN nanophosphors for solid-state white lighting. Calculations of the correlated color temperature and color-quality scale parameters confirmed the utility of the experimental process for different applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Upconversion luminescence characteristic about YNbO4 powder material doped with Ho3+ and Yb3+ ions is reported. Ho3+/Yb3+ co-doped YNbO4 powder material is prepared through solid-state reaction, absorption spectrum of prepared sample is measured and spectral characteristic is calculated through Judd -Ofelt (J-O) theory. Emission spectrum of prepared sample excited under 980 nm laser diode (LD) is obtained, and results indicate that there are three groups of upconversion emission peaks located at 540 nm and 548 nm, 642 nm and 663 nm, 758 nm, respectively, which correspond to level transitions from F-5(4) to I-5(8), from F-5(5) to I-5(7) ensity and working current of exciting LD is done, and the fitting results prove that this up-conversion luminescence are all two-photon absorption procedure.

AB The use of amorphous, SiO2-TiO2 nanolayered coatings has been proposed recently for the mirrors of 3rd-generation interferometric detectors of gravitational waves, to be operated at low temperature. Coatings with a high number of low-high index sub-units pairs with nanoscale thickness were found to preserve the amorphous structure for high annealing temperatures, a key factor to improve the mechanical quality of the mirrors. The optimization of mirror designs based on such coatings requires a detailed knowledge of the optical properties of sub-units at the nm-thick scale. To this aim we have performed a Spectroscopic Ellipsometry (SE) study of amorphous SiO2-TiO2 nanolayered films deposited on Si wafers by Ion Beam Sputtering (IBS). We have analyzed films that are composed of 5 and 19 nanolayers (NL5 and NL19 samples) and have total Optical thickness nominally equivalent to a quarter of wavelength,at 1064 nm. A set of reference optical properties for the constituent materials was obtained by the analysis of thicker SiO2 and TiO2 homogeneous films (similar to 120 nm) deposited by the same IBS facility. By flanking SE with ancillary techniques, such as TEM and AFM, we built optical models that allowed us to retrieve the broad-band (250-1700 nm) optical properties of the nanolayers in the NL5 and NL19 composite films. In the models which provided the best agreement between simulation and data, the thickness of each sub-unit was fitted within rather narrow bounds determined by the analysis of TEM measurements on witness samples. Regarding the NL5 sample, with thickness of 19.9 nm and 27.1 nm for SiO2 and TiO2 sub-units, respectively, the optical properties presented limited variations with respect to the thin film counterparts. For the NL19 sample, which is composed of ultrathin sub-units (4.4 nm and 8.4 nm for SiO2 and TiO2, respectively) we observed a significant decrease of the IR refraction index for both types of subunits; this points to a lesser mass density with respect to the thin film reference. The results are discussed in the light of the existing literature on nanofilms of amorphous oxides. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Several different quantities of Ce/TiO2 materials were synthesized in the same condition by a wet method. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) were fabricated by using porous Ce/TiO2 film electrodes derived from P25 nanoparticles. Various techniques such as X-ray diffraction, Scanning electron microscope and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller are used to characterize the products. The short-circuit current density and photo-electric conversion efficiency reach optimum values: 13.87 mA cm(-2) and 7.00% respectively when the amount of Ce(NO3)(3)center dot 6H(2)O is 0.050 g/1 g P25, which may be attributed to better transportation of electrons and more adsorption of dyes and sunlight.

AB This paper reports structural and luminescence properties of Eu-doped CaAl2O4 produced by an alternative sol-gel method using coconut water. Results of differential thermal analysis (DTA), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) allowed us to identify the best synthesis conditions for sample preparation. Simultaneous measurements of X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray excited optical luminescence (XEOL) were also performed in the X-ray energy range of the Eu L-III edge. Results from photoluminescence (PL) showed only the characteristic Eu3+ emission. However, radio luminescence emission spectra from Eu-doped CaAl2O4 shows a process of conversion of Eu3+ to Eu2+, which is induced by X-ray irradiation and is dependent on the radiation dose energy. X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) measurements corroborate Eu reduction due to irradiation, showing that only the Eu3+ ion is present in stable form in the CaAl2O4. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Neodymium doped lithium lead alumino borate glasses were synthesized with the molar composition 10Li(2)O-10PbO-(10-x) Al2O3-70B(2)O(3)-x Nd2O3 (where, x = 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 mol %) via conventional melt quenching technique to understand their lasing potentialities using the absorption, emission and photoluminescence decay spectral measurements. The oscillator strengths measured from the absorption spectra were used to estimate the Judd-Ofelt intensity parameters using least square fitting procedure. The emission spectra recorded for the as-prepared glasses under investigation exhibit two emission transitions F-4(3/2) -> I-4(11/2) (1063 nm) and F-4(3/2) -> I-4(9/2) (1350 nm) for which radiative parameters have been evaluated. The emission intensity increases with increase in Nd3+ ion concentration up to I mol % and beyond concentration quenching took place. The decay profile shows single exponential nature for lower Nd3+ ion concentration and non-exponential for higher concentration. To elucidate the nature of energy transfer process, the non-exponential decay curves were well fitted to Inokuti-Hirayama model. The relatively higher values of emission cross-sections, branching ratios and quantum efficiency values obtained for 1.0 mol% of Nd3+ ions in LiPbAIB glass suggests it's aptness in generating lasing action at 1063 nm in NIR region.

AB Excitation-wavelength-dependent blue-greenish fluorescent carbon quantum dots (CQDs) with graphite structure were synthesized by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. In comparison with those synthesized by hydrothermal method (named H-CQDs), C-CQDs have less hydrophilic terminal groups, showing good solubility in common organic solvents. Furthermore, these synthesized C-CQDs show a low LUMO energy level (LUMO = -3.84 eV), which is close to that of phenyl-C-61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM, LUMO = -4.01 eV), the most widely used electron acceptor in polymer solar cells. Photoluminescence quenching of the poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl):C-CQDs blended film (P3HT:C-CQDs) indicated that a photo-induced charge transfer between P3HT and C-CQDs occurs in such a composite film. Bulk heterojunction solar cells using C-CQDs as electron acceptors or doping materials were fabricated and tested. High fill factors were achieved for these C-CQDs based polymer solar cells, demonstrating that CQDs synthesized by CVD could be alternative to the fullerene derivatives for applying in polymer solar cells.

AB A comparative study of radiation damage caused by the irradiation of oxygen-free calcium fluoride single crystals with similar to GeV Xe-132 or Bi-209 heavy ions, 100-keV light hydrogen ions (protons) or X-rays at room temperature has been performed. Optical absorption in a wide spectral region from NIR to VUV (1.5 -10.5 eV), its dependence on stepwise preheating of the irradiated CaF2 crystals to a certain temperature as well as thermally stimulated luminescence accompanying the main annealing stages have been analyzed. It is shown that in addition to different F-type aggregates, Ca colloids and trifluorine quasi molecules, complex and temperature stable structural defects responsible for VUV absorption (in particular, the 9.8 eV band) are induced in CaF2 only after irradiation with swift heavy ions. The origin and tentative creation mechanisms of such defects as well as the features of the used irradiation types are considered. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The light conversion efficiency of traditional a-Si thin-film solar cells is limited by their low optical thicknesses, especially in the NIR. A possible approach to increase the light-trapping efficiency over the entire solar spectral range is to design solar-cell architectures which rely on the optical properties of plasmonic nanocomposite materials. We demonstrate that it is possible to have a controlled Gold nanoparticle optical absorption by varying the thickness of a covering a-Si thin-film. For thick a-Si films the Gold nanoparticle plasmon resonance vanishes likely due to the formation of a silicide. Optical absorption measurements as well as finite difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations were employed to determine the a-Si thickness-dependent optical absorption properties, which demonstrated a significantly increased optical absorption in a-Si.

AB In this paper we precisely determine laser-induced refractive index profiles created in cyclic olefin copolymer Topas 6017 employing a sophisticated phase shifting Mach-Zehnder interferometry approach. Beyond the usual one-dimensional modification depth measurement we highlight that for straight waveguide structures also a two-dimensional refractive index distribution can be directly obtained providing full information of a waveguide's exact cross section and its gradient refractive index contrast. Deployed as direct data input in optical waveguide simulation, the evaluated 2D refractive index profiles permit a detailed calculation of the waveguides' actual mode profiles. Furthermore, conventional one-dimensional interferometric measurements for refractive index depth profiles with varying total imposed laser fluence of a 248 nm KrF excimer laser are included to investigate the effect on refractive index modification depth. Maximum surface refractive index increase turns out to attain up to 1.86.10(-3) enabling laser-written optical waveguide channels. Additionally, a comprehensive optical material characterization in terms of dispersion, thermo-optic coefficient and absorption measurement of unmodified and UV-modified Topas 6017 is carried out.

AB The effects of gamma-irradiation are studied on the morphology and structural properties of ZnO nanowire with various diameters. The ZnO nanowires are grown using Zn thin films at various initial thicknesses including 125, 250 and 500 nm in air ambient. The results illustrate dramatic effects of Gamma-irradiation on the deformation of ZnO nanowires. Thus, radiation induce ripple ZnO surfaces instead ZnO nanowires. Gamma-irradiation has also been effective on the optical and crystalline properties of the nanowires. X-ray diffraction attests that size of the ZnO nano-structures has changed and (100) crystalline direction related to Zn metal has been created after irradiation. UV Visible spectra display two areas for transmittance of irradiated ZnO nanowires, one in the Visible-light and the other in IR sub-region. In the Visible-light area, the layer gets thicker from 125 to 500 nm; the difference between the layer transmittance spectra is reduced before and after gamma irradiation. In the IR-light region, with increasing of ZnO initial thickness, the difference between the layer transmittance spectra is increased before and after gamma irradiation. The photoluminescence spectroscopy displays that intensity of green yellow band improves in compared to near-band-edge emission due to formation of Zn metal and oxygen vacancies after gamma irradiation.

AB Development of visible-light-excited lanthanide (III) complex-based luminescent probes is highly appealing due to their superiority of less damage to the living biosystems over the conventional UV-light-excited ones. In this work, a visible-light-excited europium (III) complex-based luminescent probe, BPED-BHHCT-Eu3+-BPT, has been designed and synthesized by conjugating the Cu2+-binding N,N-bis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethanediamine (BPED) to a tetradentate beta-diketone ligand 4,4'bis(1",1",1",2",2",3",3"-heptafluoro-4",6"-hexanedione-6"-yl)chlorosulfo-o-terphenyl (BHHCT) and coordinating with a coligand 2-(N,N-diethylanilin-4-y1)-4,6-bis(pyrazol-1-y1)-1,3,5-triazine) (BPT) for the time-gated luminescence detection of Cu2+ ions and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in living cells. BPED-BHHCT-Eu3+-BPT exhibited a sharp excitation peak at 407 nm and a wide excitation window extending to beyond 460 nm. Upon its reaction with Cu2+ ions, the luminescence of BPED-BHHCT-Eu3+-BPT was efficiently quenched, which could be reversibly restored by the addition of H2S due to the strong affinity between Cu2+ ions and H2S. The "on-off-on" type luminescence behavior of BPED-BHHCT-Eu3+-BPT towards Cu2+ ions and H2S enabled the sensing of the two species with high sensitivity and selectivity. The performances of BPED-BHHCT-Eu3+-BPT for visualizing intracellular Cu2+ ions and H2S were investigated, and the results have demonstrated the practical applicability of the probe for molecular imaging of cells.

AB A series of red-emitting phosphors Ca3Sr3(VO4)(4):0.05Eu(3+); Ca3Sr3(VO4)(4):0.05Eu(3+), xSm(3+); and Ca3Sr3(VO4)(4):0.05Eu(3+), 0.05Sm(3+), yM(+) (M = Li, Na, and K) were fabricated with the combustion method. The microstructure and photoluminescence properties of the phosphors were investigated via X-ray powder diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and photoluminescence spectroscopy. The obtained results revealed that all samples perfectly matched the rhombohedral structure with Ric space group. The results showed that the luminescence properties of Eu3+ ions could evidently be improved by co doping with Sm3+ ions. When the doping mole fraction of Sm3+ ions was 5%, the relative luminous intensity at 619 nm was maximal under an excitation of 464 nm. Moreover, incorporation of charge compensators (i.e., Li+, Na+, and K+) could improve both the luminescence intensity and thermal stability of phosphors under an excitation of 464 nm and this paper discusses and interprets the underlying reason. The optimal concentration of the charge compensator M+ (M = Li, Na, and K) was 5%. In particular, the Lit-doped sample exhibited significantly enhanced emission intensity and thermal stability under an excitation wavelength of 464 nm and its emission intensity was approximately 1.9-fold of that of Ca3Sr3(VO4)(4):0.05Eu(3+), 0.05Sm(3+). Furthermore, the CIE chromaticity coordinate of Ca3Sr3(VO4)(4):0.05Eu(3+), 0.05Sm(3+), 0.05Lit phosphor was found to be closer to the standard red-emitting point (x = 0.67, y = 0.33) compared to Ca3Sr3(VO4)(4):0.05Eu(3+), 0.05Sm(3+). The luminescence performance of Ca3Sr3(VO4)(4):Eu3+, Sm3+, Li+ upon excitation with blue light radiation makes this a potential red emitting phosphor for application in blue-based white light emitting diodes.

AB We synthesized pure and Eu3+ doped Al6Ge2O13 samples by an easy and low-cost sol-gel route using the GeO2, Al(NO3)(3) center dot 9H(2)O and Eu(NO3)(3)center dot 6H(2)O as precursors, tetramethylammonium hydroxide and ethanol as solvents. The Al6Ge2O13 crystalline phase possesses orthorhombic structure and is a potential host for rare earth ions, especially due to high aluminum concentration. Homogeneous and transparent cols and gels were obtained. The samples containing 1 mol% of Eu3+ were heat -treated at 1000 degrees C to eliminate organic compounds, providing high optical quality and structural purity. All materials were characterized by thermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, high resolution transmission electron microscopy, selected area electron diffraction, diffuse reflectance spectra in the ultraviolet-visible-near-infrared regions and photoluminescence measurements. High purity of Eu3+ doped Al6Ge2O13 orthorhombic phase and well crystallized grain dimensions of around 100 nm was obtained with high red photoluminescence emission. The decay lifetime of D-5(0) level from Eu3+ (the emission at 612 nm) was determined, being between 0.97 and 2.12 ms, and an average quantum efficiency of 54% was determined (considering the average experimental lifetime of 1.77 ms). Moreover, it was calculated and analyzed some parameters ofJudd-Ofelt theory applied to Eu3+ emissions from Al6Ge2O13 host. The results show that Eu3+ doped Al6Ge2O13 crystalline compounds have large potential to be used in displays and LED devices. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The influence of annealing temperature on the transmission spectra of photonic crystals composed of polystyrene and silicon dioxide microspheres was studied. It was found that annealing of photonic crystals based on polystyrene and silica leads to a shift in the photonic band gap to the short-wavelength region. Based on the results of optical studies, the dependences of the structural parameters of the obtained opal-like crystals on annealing temperature were obtained. In the case of polystyrene photonic crystals, the displacement of the photonic band gap is observed in a narrow temperature range above the glass transition temperature. For SiO2 photonic crystals, it was found that the process of microspheres sintering is complex and involves three stages of structural modification. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, an efficient method based on biotin-labeled aptamer and streptavidin-conjugated fluorescence -magnetic silica nanoprobes (FITC@Fe3O4@SiNPs-SA) has been established for human breast carcinoma MCF-7 cells synchronous labeling and separation. Carboxyl-modified fluorescence-magnetic silica nanoparticles (FITC@Fe3O4@SiNPs-COOH) were first synthesized using the Stober method. Streptavidin (SA) was then conjugated to the surface of FITC@Fe3O4@SiNPs-COOH. The MCF-7 cell suspension was incubated with biotin-labeled MUC-1 aptamer. After centrifugation and washing, the cells were then treated with FITC@Fe3O4@SiNPs-SA. Afterwards, the mixtures were separated by a magnet. The cell probe conjugates were then imaged using fluorescent microscopy. The results show that the MUC-1 aptamer could recognize and bind to the targeted cells with high affinity and specificity, indicating the prepared FITC@v@SiNPs-SA with great photostability and superparamagnetism could be applied effectively in labeling and separation for MCF-7 cell in suspension synchronously. In addition, the feasibility of MCF-7 cells detection in peripheral blood was assessed. The results indicate that the method above is also applicable for cancer cells synchronous labeling and separation in complex biological system. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In recent years, nanowires have been shown to exhibit high photosensitivities, and, therefore are of interest in a variety of optoelectronic applications, for example, colour-sensitive photodetectors. In this study, we fabricated two-terminal PbS, In2S3, CdS and ZnSe single-nanowire photoresistor devices and tested applicability of these materials under the same conditions for colour-sensitive (405 nm, 532 nm and 660 nm) light detection. Nanowires were grown via atmospheric pressure chemical vapour transport method, their structure and morphology were characterized by scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and optical properties were investigated with photoluminescence (PL) measurements. Single-nanowire photoresistors were fabricated via in situ nanomanipulations inside SEM, using focused ion beam (FIB) cutting and electron-beam-assisted platinum welding; their current-voltage characteristics and photoresponse values were measured. Applicability of the tested nanowire materials for colour-sensitive light detection is discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In recent times, there have been rapid advances in the solid-state laser lighting technology. Due to the large amounts of heat accumulated from the high flux laser radiation, color conversion materials used in solid-state laser lighting devices should possess high durability, high thermal conductivity, and low thermal quenching. The aim of this study is to develop a thermally robust SiO2-YAG:Ce composite thick film (CTF) for high-power solid-state laser lighting applications. Commercial colloidal silica which was used as the source of SiO2, played the roles of an adhesive, a filler, and a protecting agent. Compared to the YAG:Ce powder, the CIF exhibits remarkable thermal stability (11.3% intensity drop at 200 degrees C) and durability (4.5% intensity drop after 1000 h, at 85 degrees C and 85% humidity). Furthermore, the effects of the substrate material and the thickness of the CTF on the laser lighting performance were investigated in terms of their thermal quenching and luminescence saturation behaviors, respectively. The CTF with a thickness of 50 mu m on a sapphire substrate does not show luminescence saturation, despite a high-power density of incident radiation i.e. 20 W/mm(2). These results demonstrate the potential applicability of the CTF in solid-state laser lighting devices. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Black phosphorus (BP) nanostructures enable a new strategy to tune the electronic and optical properties of this atomically thin material. In this paper we show, via density functional theory calculations, the possibility to modify the optical properties of BP quantum dots via covalent functionalization. The quantum dot selected in this study has chemical formula P24H12 and has been covalent functionalized with one or more benzene rings or anthracene. The effect of functionalization is highlighted in the absorption spectra, where a red shift of the absorption is noticeable. The shift can be ascribed to an electron delocalization in the black phosphorus/organic molecule nanostructure. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We report synthesis, characterizations, structure-property relationships, and third-order nonlinear optical studies for two new chalcone derivatives, (2E)-1-(anthracen-9-yl)-3-(4-bromophenyl)prop-2-en-1-one (Br-ANC) and (2E)-1-(anthracen-9-yl)-3-(4-chlorophenyl)prop-2-en-1-one (CI-ANC). These derivatives were crystallized in the centrosymmetric monoclinic P2(1)/c crystal structure. The intermolecular interactions of both the crystals were visualized by Hirshfeld surface analyses (HSA). The crystals are thermally stable up to their melting points (180.82 and 191.16 degrees C for Cl-ANC and Br-ANC, respectively). The geometry optimizations, FT-IR spectra, H-1 and C-13 NMR spectra, electronic absorption spectra, electronic transitions, and HOMO-LUMO energy gaps were studied by Density Functional Theory (DFT) at B3LYP/6-311-FG(d, p) level. The theoretical results provide excellent agreement with experimental findings. The electric dipole moments, static polarizabilities, molecular electrostatic potentials (MEP) and global chemical reactivity descriptors (GCRD) were also theoretically computed. The materials exhibited good nonlinear absorption (NLA), nonlinear refraction (NLR) and optical limiting (OL) behavior under diode-pumped solid-state (DPSS) continuous wave (CW) laser excitation (532 nm and 200 mW). The NLO parameters such as NLA coefficient ((beta similar to 10(-5) cmW(-1)), NLR index (n(2)similar to 10(-10) cm(2) W-1) and third-order NLO susceptibilities (chi(3)similar to 10(-7) esu) were measured. Further, we estimated one-photon and two-photon figures of merit, which satisfy the demands (W > 1 and T < 1) for all-optical switching. Thus, the present chalcone derivatives with anthracene moiety are potential materials for OL and optical switching applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Effect of Al/Ga substitution on the structural and luminescence

AB As candidates for display and lighting materials, a series of gallium-substituted cerium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Y-3(GaxAl1-x)(5)O-12: Ce3+) phosphors were synthesized by high temperature solid-state reaction. The phases, morphology, luminescence spectra and thermal stability of the phosphors were investigated. The volatilization of Ga2O3 induces the constituents out of stoichiometric ratio and different impurities in the system. The excitation and emission spectra occur red shift (339 nm - 351 nm) and blue shift (465 nm - 437 nm), and blue shift (541 nm - 517 nm), respectively. The spectra have no further blue shift and the luminescence intensity decrease with x over 0.4. Combining crystal structure with PL spectrum, the distortion of dodecahedron and crystal field splitting of 5d level of Ce3+ are influenced by Ga3+ in octahedral coordination polyhedron rather than tetrahedron. The crystalline perfection and Ga3+ occupying the tetrahedron induce less garnet phase formation, more impurities and the 5d level located in the conductive bands, thus accounting for the x = 0.4 turning points of the PL and PLE intensity. Based on the thermal quenching and CIE, the Y-3(GaxAl1-x)(5)O-12: Ce3+ (0.06) phosphors have great potential for use on the w-LED. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS), as one type of third-order nonlinear optics effect, is extensively exploited and rapidly developed in the field of lasers and optoelectronics. A large number of theoretical and experimental studies on SBS have been carried out in the past decades. Especially, the exploration of new SBS materials and new types of SBS modulation methods have been engaged simultaneously, as the properties of different materials have great influence on the SBS performance such as generation threshold, Brillouin amplification efficiency, frequency shift, breakdown threshold, etc. This article provides a comprehensive review of the characteristics of different types of SBS materials, SBS applications, experimental design methods, as well as the parameter optimization method, which is expected to provide reference and guidance to SBS related experiments.

AB In this work the effects of laser radiation and annealing process on the change of the optical properties of gold doped borosilicate glass are presented. The glass is fabricated by conventional melt quenching method as samples with three different concentrations of gold are produced. The laser irradiation is performed by a Nd:YAG system that generates nanosecond pulses at wavelengths of 1064, 532, 355, and 266 nm. The optical properties of the glass samples are studied on the basis of their transmission spectra in the UV-near IR spectral range. The results indicate that irradiation at wavelength of 266 nm induces color changes assigned to formation of defects (color centers). Annealing of the samples results in formation of red colored zones which positions correspond to the irradiated ones. The optical properties and TEM observation indicate that this effect is related to formation of gold nanoparticles. The optical spectra of the areas irradiated by laser pulses and annealed are studied for different processing parameters pulse number, laser fluence, annealing temperature, annealing time, and the gold concentration in the glass. Processing parameters that ensure efficient tuning of the optical spectra are defined. The presented study can be a basis for a method for surface modification of glass samples that can lead to formation of nanoparticle composed layer with tunable optical properties for applications as novel optical elements.

AB A series of conducting copolymers based on methoxybenzene and thiophene are prepared via direct anodic oxidation of the mixtures of methoxybenzene and thiophene in boron trifluoride diethyl etherate (BFEE). Feed ratio of methoxybenzene/thiophene plays great effect on the electrochromic performance of the copolymers, which can exhibit multicolor and tunable electrochromism. The copolymer prepared with methoxybenzene/thiophene feed ratio of 1/8 exhibits excellent electrochromic properties which presents golden color, yellow green, green blue and dark blue under various applied potentials. The optical contrast and response time (monitored at the absorption peak of 474 nm) are 15.1% and 0.6s, respectively. The corresponding coloration efficiency is calculated as 307 cm(2)/C. In addition, the copolymer shows decent optical stability which only loses optical contrast of 1.4% at 474 nm after 200steps. All of these indicate that high-performance electrochromic materials can be prepared via simply commercial available monomers such as thiophene and methoxybenzene. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB 5 at%Yb:Sc2O3 transparent ceramics were fabricated by the co-precipitation and vacuum sintering method. NH4HCO3 and (NH4)(2)SO4 were used as precipitant and dispersing agent in the precipitation process, respectively. The influence of ammonium hydrogen carbonate to metal ions molar ratio (R value) on the morphology, agglomeration of resultant powders and the optical quality of transparent ceramics was investigated systematically. It was found that all the calcined powders synthesized with different R values exhibited same phase. The morphology of the precursors and calcined powders was investigated by FESEM, and the results show that the R value has a significant influence on the morphology of 5 at% Yb:Sc2O3 precursors and calcined powders. The precursors and resultant powders exhibit a severe agglomeration with R = 4.4 and 4.8. Using these powders as starting materials, 5 at%Yb:Sc2O3 transparent ceramics were successfully fabricated by vacuum sintering at 1850 degrees C for 10 h. There is only little difference in optical transmittances of 5 at%Yb:Sc2O3 ceramics with R value within the 3.2-4.0 range. The ceramic sample with R = 4.0 possesses the best optical quality with the in-line transmittance of 71.9% at the wavelength of 1100 nm. The microstructures of the 5 at%Yb:Sc2O3 transparent ceramics with different R values were also investigated. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Quinoline and its derivatives have a wide range of biological and pharmacological activities. Quinoline ring is used to design functional materials (quinoline derivatives) for OLEDs and field-induce electrooptics. It possesses antibacterial, antifungal, antimalarial, cardiotonic, anthelmintic, anti-inflammatory, anticonvulsant and analgesic activity. Here, we have examined photoexcitation dynamics of 6-hydroxyquinoline (6-HQ) doped in polymer films of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and cellulose acetate (CA) at atmospheric conditions. The absorption maximum of 6-HQ in polymer films was observed at 333 +/- 1 nm, whereas fluorescence (FL) maximum fell in the range of 365-371 nm. In PVA film, in addition to the typical FL, a band maximum at 432 nm appeared as a result of an excited-state intermolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) reaction facilitated in the hydrogen-bonded complex formed in the ground state between 6-HQ:PVA. The multi-exponential decay behavior of 6-HQ in all the three polymer films indicates a nanoscale heterogeneity of the polymer environments. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Carbon quantum dots (CQDs) was successfully functionalized with Mal-PEG-NHS linked RGERPPR. They exhibit double functions of both tissue imaging and targeting to brain gliomas. The mean size of the functionalized CQDs about 9.0 +/- 2.0 nm. The maximum absorption wavelength of the functionalized CQDs appear at 230 nm. The peak of the fluorescence spectra for the functionalized CQDs is at 460 nm, red shifted by 20 nm comparing with the unmodified CQDs. This may be due to the increased particle size. The functionalized CQDs were successfully applied to imaging and targeting gliomas. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We herein employ nonlinear laser imaging microscopy to explicitly study the dynamics of second harmonic generation (SHG) in silver iodide phosphate glasses. While glasses of this family have gained extensive scientific attention over the years due to their superior conducting properties, considerably less attention has been paid to their unique nonlinear optical characteristics. In the present study, firstly, it is demonstrated that SHG signal intensity is enhanced upon increasing silver content due to the random formation of silver microstructures within the glass network. Secondly, the SHG temperature dynamics were explored near the glass transition temperature (T-g) regime, where significant glass relaxation phenomena occur. It is found that heating towards the T-g improves the SHG efficiency, whereas above T-g, the capacity of glasses to generate second harmonic radiation is drastically suppressed. The novel findings of this work are considered important in terms of the potential employment of these glasses for the realization of advanced photonic applications like optical -switches and wavelength conversion devices.

AB Tb3+-doped Lu2O3 nanophosphors were prepared via simple sol-gel method, at different pH value of solution (2, 5, 8 and 11), using diethanolamine (DEA) as polymerization agent. The nanopowder samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission-scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman spectroscopy, room temperature steady and time resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy. The structural analysis reveals that all samples mainely crystallized in the cubic bixbyite structure with 1a3 space group. Also, it was found that the pH value of solution strongly influences the crystallite size, the vibrational frequency modes and the surface morphology of Lu2O3:Tb3+ nanocrystals. All samples show blue-greenish emissions, corresponding to D-5(4) -> F-7(J) (J = 3, 4, 5 and 6) intraconfigurationnelles transitions. The intense green emission peak situated at 542 nm is assigned to D-5(4) -> F-7(5) transition. The 4f(8) -> 4f(7)5d(1) spin-allowed and forbidden transitions, the charge transfer band (CTB) O2- -> Tb3+ and the host absorption bands were observed and their dependence on pH value is discussed.

AB The low temperature spectroscopic properties of Bi3+ impurities in the double perovskite, La2MgTiO6, is examined in this work. The luminescence is interpreted on the basis of localized Bi3+ P-3(0,1) -> S-1(0) transition. Band structure calculations reveal that the bottom of the conduction band is composed of Ti4+ 3d orbitals. In La2MgTiO6, the Bi3+ P-3(0,1) states fall below the Ti4+ 3d(0) conduction band which permits the first observation of luminescence from the localized Bi3+ P-3(0,1) excited state in a titanate host lattice.

AB We theoretically investigated the effects of the impurity position, in-plane electric field, intensity and polarization of the probe and control lasers on the electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) in GaAs/GaAIAs disc shaped quantum ring. Our study reveals that, depending on the impurity position, the quantum system presents two specific configurations for the EIT occurrence even in the absence of the external electric field, i.e. ladder-configuration or V-configuration, and changes the configuration from ladder to V for specific electric field values. The polarization of the probe and control lasers plays a crucial role in obtaining a good transparency. The electric field controls the red-shift (blue-shift) of the transparency window and modifies its width. The system exhibits birefringence for the probe light in a limited interval of electric field values. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The color-tunable upconversion (UC) emission and optical temperature sensing behavior was observed from the Er-Yb codoped Gd2TiO5 (GTO) phosphors synthesized by the simple sol-gel method. By control of the Yb3+ concentration, the phosphors are capable of generating color tunable UC luminescence from yellowish green to yellow, then to orange. The tunable emission is due to the energy back transfer from Er+3 to Yb3+ and the cross relaxation between the two neighboring Er3+ ions. The temperature dependence of the fluorescence intensity ratios (FIR) of two green UC emissions in Gd2TiO5:Yb3+/Er3+ phosphors with different Yb3+ doping concentration have been studied in the range of 298-573 K under 980 nm laser diode excitation and the maximum sensitivities were approximately 40.76 x 10(-4) K-1 at 565 K. The above results suggest that the as-prepared Gd2TiO5:Yb3+/Er3+ phosphors have great potential for the applications of lightings and optical temperature sensors. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB The nonlinear optical and the upconversion luminescence (UCL) properties of CsPbX3 (X = Br or its binary mixtures with CI, I) quantum dots (QDs) are investigated by femtosecond open-aperture (OA) Z-scan and time-resolved luminescence techniques in nonresonant spectral region. The OA Z-scan results show that CsPbX3 QDs have strong reverse saturable absorption (RSA), which is ascribed to two-photon absorption. Partially changing halide composition from Cl to Br, to I, two-photon absorption cross sections become larger at the same laser excitation intensity. The composition-tunable nonlinear absorption should be attributed to the gradual decrease of the lowest direct band gaps with the halide substitute. Moreover, the strong UCL can be observed under near infrared femtosecond laser excitation. Halide composition-tunable UCL dynamics of CsPbX3 QDs is analyzed by use of two-exponential fitting with deconvolution. When CsPbX3 QDs have similar sizes (10-13 nm), with partially changing halide composition from Cl to Br, to I, the average UCL lifetime becomes longer due to the variation of Kane energy. Our findings suggest all-inorganic perovskite QDs can be used as excellent gain medium for high-performance frequency-upconversion lasers and provide reference to engineer such QDs toward practical optoelectronic applications.

AB Trichloroethylene (TCE) is a chlorinated solvent that has been used widely around the world in the twentieth century for metal degreasing and dry cleaning. Although TCE displays general toxicity and is classified as a human carcinogen, the association between TCE exposure and respiratory disorders are conflicting. In this review we aimed to systematically evaluate the current evidence for the respiratory effects of TCE exposure and the implications for the practicing clinician.
   There is limited evidence of an increased risk of lung cancer associated with TCE exposure based on animal and human data. However, the effect of other chlorinated solvents and mixed solvent exposure should be further investigated. Limited data are available to support an association between TCE exposure and respiratory tract disorders such as asthma, chronic bronchitis, or rhinitis. The most consistent data is the association of TCE with autoimmune and vascular diseases such as systemic sclerosis and pulmonary veno-occlusive disease.
   Although recent data are reassuring regarding the absence of an increased lung cancer risk with TCE exposure, clinicians should be aware of other potential respiratory effects of TCE. In particular, occupational exposure to TCE has been linked to less common conditions such as systemic sclerosis and pulmonary veno-occlusive disease.

AB Introduction: Respiratory muscle dysfunction, being a common cause of weaning failure, is strongly associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation (MV) and prolonged stay in intensive care units. Inspiratory muscle training (IMT) has been described as an important contributor to the treatment of respiratory muscle dysfunction in critically ill patients. Its effectiveness is however yet controversial.
   Objective: To discuss evidence for assessment of readiness and the effectiveness of interventions for liberation from MV, with special attention to the role of IMT.
   Methods: PubMed, LILACS, PEDro and Web of Science were searched for papers of assessment and treatment of patients who failed liberation from MV after at least one attempt published in English or Portuguese until June 2016.
   Results: Weaning predictors are related to weaning success (86%-100% for sensitivity and 7%-69% for specificity) and work of breathing (73%-100% for sensitivity and 56%-100% for specificity). Spontaneous breathing trials (SBT), noninvasive MV and early mobilization have been reported to improve weaning outcomes. Two modalities of IMT were identified in five selected studies: 1) adjustment of ventilator trigger sensitivity 2) inspiratory threshold loading. Both IMT training modalities promoted significant increases in respiratory muscle strength. IMT with threshold loading showed positive effect on endurance compared to control.
   Conclusion: Methods to indentify respiratory muscle weakness in critically ill patients are feasible and described as indexes that show good accuracy. Individualized and supervised rehabilitation programs including IMT, SBT, noninvasive MV and early mobilization should be encouraged in patients with inspiratory muscle weakness.

AB Background: To analyse the relationship between symptoms at different times during the 24-hour day and outcomes in COPD.
   Methods: Observational cross-sectional study in a patients from 7 Latin American countries. The frequency of symptoms in the morning, at night and during the day was explored by means of standardised and validated questionnaires, and the relationship between symptoms and exacerbations and quality of life were investigated.
   Results: 734 patients (59.6% male, mean age 69.5 years, mean FEV1 50% predicted normal) were recruited. The most frequent symptoms during the day were dyspnea (75% of patients, of which 94% mild-moderate) and cough (72.2%, of which 93.4% mild-moderate). Highly symptomatic patients had a greater impairment in FEV1, more exacerbations and worse scores in COPD assessment test (CAT) and Body Mass Index, Obstruction, Dyspnoea and Exacerbations (BODEx) index (all p < 0.001). Morning symptoms were more frequent than night-time symptoms, particularly cough and dyspnoea (morning: 50.1% and 45.7%; night-time: 33.2% and 24.4%, respectively), and mostly rated as mild or moderate. Patients with morning or night-time symptoms presented with worse severity of daytime symptoms. There was a strong correlation between intensity of daytime with morning or night-time symptoms, as well as with CAT score (r = 0.715; p < 0.001), but a weak correlation with FEV1 (r = -0.205; p < 0.001).
   Conclusion: Morning symptoms were more frequent than night-time symptoms, and having either morning and/or night-time symptoms was associated with worse severity of daytime symptoms. Increased symptoms were strongly associated with worse quality of life and more frequent exacerbations, but weakly associated with airflow limitation.

AB Introduction: The COPD classification proposed by the Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease was recently revised, and the A to D grouping is now based on symptoms and exacerbations only. Potential associations with comorbidities have not been assessed so far. Thus the aim of the present study was to determine the relationship between the revised (2017) GOLD groups A-D and major comorbidities.
   Methods: We used baseline data from the COPD cohort COSYCONET. Comorbidities were identified from patient self-reports and disease-specific medication: gastrointestinal disorders, asthma, sleep apnea, hyperuricemia, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, osteoporosis, mental disorders, heart failure, hypertension, coronary artery disease. The A-D groups were based on either the COPD Assessment Test or the modified Medical Research Council scale. Exacerbations were also categorized as per GOLD recommendations.
   Results: Data from 2228 patients were analyzed. Using GOLD group A as a reference, group D was associated with nearly all comorbidities, followed by group B and C. When groups A-D were dichotomized as AC vs. BD (symptoms) and AB vs. CD (exacerbations), all comorbidities correlated with symptoms and/or exacerbations. This was true for both mMRC- and CAT-based categorizations.
   Conclusions: These findings suggest that the recently modified GOLD categorization is clinically relevant beyond being purely an assessment of symptoms and exacerbations. As the A-D groups correlated with the risk of important comorbidities, with some differences in terms of the correlation with symptoms and exacerbations, the findings underline the importance of identifying comorbidities in COPD, particularly in non-responders to therapy who have high symptoms and/or exacerbation rates.

AB Background: Omalizumab, a humanized anti-IgE monoclonal antibody, is the first molecularly targeted drug for severe asthmatics. However, responses to omalizumab vary widely among patients.
   Objectives: This study aimed to assess the potential of baseline serum cytokine levels as predictors of responsiveness to omalizumab.
   Methods: Thirty-one patients with severe, persistent asthma were enrolled in this study and administered omalizumab for at least 1 year. Response to omalizumab was assessed based on the physician's global evaluation of treatment effectiveness (GETE) at 48 weeks of treatment. Blood samples were collected at baseline and 16 and 32 weeks after starting omalizumab and measured for 30 cytokines by Luminex 200 and ELISA. Exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) levels, peripheral blood eosinophil counts, pre-bronchodilator pulmonary functions and Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire scores were determined at baseline and 16, 32 and 48 weeks after starting omalizumab. The numbers of clinically significant asthma exacerbations in the previous year and during 48 weeks of treatment with omalizumab were assessed.
   Results: GETE assessment showed 19 responders (61.3%) and 12 non-responders (38.7%). Responders showed significantly higher levels of CXCL10 and IL-12 at baseline compared to non-responders (CXCL10: responders, 1530.0 +/- 315.2 pg/ml vs. non-responders, 1066.0 +/- 396.8 pg/ml, P = 0.001; IL-12: responders, 60.2 +/- 39.2 pg/ml vs. non-responders, 32.2 +/- 26.3 pg/ml, P = 0.04). ROC curves to distinguish responders from non-responders using the baseline serum CXCL10 level showed a good AUC of 0.83. At 32 weeks of omalizumab therapy, serum CXCL10 tended to be increased (1350 +/- 412.3 pg/ml at baseline vs. 1529 +/- 637.6 pg/ml at 32 weeks, P = 0.16) and serum IL-12 tended to be decreased (49.4 +/- 37.0 pg/ml at baseline vs. 43.9 +/- 30.9 pg/ml at 32 weeks, P = 0.05). On the other hand, serum IL-5 and PDGF were significantly decreased (IL-5: 54.2 +/- 13.8 pg/ml at baseline vs. 49.1 +/- 12.5 pg/ml at 32 weeks, P = 0.008; PDGFZ 4821 +/- 2458 pg/ml at baseline vs. 4219 +/- 1951 pg/ml at 32 weeks, P = 0.048).
   Conclusions: High baseline serum CXCL10 and IL-12 levels may be useful in predicting a good omalizumab response in severe asthmatics.

AB Objective: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) patients compared to controls have been found to have abnormal patterns in the default mode network (DMN) in the morning when symptom threshold is the highest and symptoms are least likely to occur. If these morning abnormalities in DMN are pertinent to disease expression, then similar or further detectable differences may be expected on a nighttime assessment when RLS symptom threshold is at its lowest. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the potential neural mechanisms underlying the circadian aspect of RLS symptom expression by assessing diurnal changes in DMN.
   Methods: Fifteen drug-naive subjects with idiopathic RLS and 15 age-and gender-matched healthy subjects had fMRI scans in the morning and evening. The DMN patterns were compared both for differences between morning and evening and between RLS and controls.
   Results: RLS patients compared to the healthy controls showed significant differences in morning and evening DMN. In particular, RLS patients showed consistent increased connectivity in the parietal lobule in both the morning and evening. In contrast, connectivity in the thalamus was increased in the morning and reduced in the evening. In addition, there were negative correlations between thalamic connectivity and the Korean versions of the international RLS scale and the quality-of-life subscore.
   Conclusions: The results indicated diurnal disturbances of the DMN in RLS subjects are consistent with both the circadian rhythm and severity of RLS. The circadian expression of RLS may relate to changes in arousal cortical-activation thresholds occurring with diurnal changes in the thalamic circuits of the DMN. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Objective/background: This study investigated the addition of a real-time feedback patient engagement tool on positive airway pressure (PAP) adherence when added to a proactive telemedicine strategy.
   Patients/methods: Data from a German healthcare provider (ResMed Healthcare Germany) were retrospectively analyzed. Patients who first started PAP therapy between 1 September 2009 and 30 April 2014, and were managed using telemedicine (AirView (TM); proactive care) or telemedicine thorn patient engagement tool (AirView (TM) + myAir (TM); patient engagement) were eligible. Patient demographics, therapy start date, sleep-disordered breathing indices, device usage hours, and therapy termination rate were obtained and compared between the two groups.
   Results: The first 500 patients managed by telemedicine-guided care and a patient engagement tool were matched with 500 patients managed by telemedicine-guided care only. The proportion of nights with device usage >= 4 h was 77 +/- 25% in the patient engagement group versus 63 +/- 32% in the proactive care group (p < 0.001). Therapy termination occurred less often in the patient engagement group (p < 0.001). The apnea-hypopnea index was similar in the two groups, but leak was significantly lower in the patient engagement versus proactive care group (2.7 +/- 4.0 vs 4.1 +/- 5.3 L/min; p < 0.001).
   Conclusions: Addition of a patient engagement tool to telemonitoring-guided proactive care was associated with higher device usage and lower leak. This suggests that addition of an engagement tool may help improve PAP therapy adherence and reduce mask leak. (c) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Scorpionism is a relevant public health problem in several countries in tropical and subtropical regions. In Brazil, Tityus serrulatus sting can induce acute lung injury in part as a consequence of inflammation. Despite the occurrence of other scorpions of Tityus genus in Brazilian scorpiofauna, the knowledge regarding pulmonary alterations is related to T. serrulatus venom (Tsv). Here we studied, comparatively, the pathophysiological changes in the rat airways envenomed by Tsv or T. bahiensis venom (Tbv), since both scorpions are involved in human accidents but with severe envenomations occurring when victims are stung by T. serrulatus. After intravenous injection of the venoms (200 mu g/kg), both were able to induce Evans blue extravasation (in 30 min) into airways and increased protein extravasation into lungs at 4 and 24 h, but the magnitude of such events was higher in Tsv group. Hemorrhage (in 60 min) in the lungs was higher in Tbv group, while IL-1 beta (at 1 h) and IL-6 (at 1 and 4 h) in lung homogenates were detected only in Tsv group. Four and 24 h after envenomation, myeloperoxidase activity in lung was equally augmented in the envenomed groups, as well as an increased in polymorphonuclear cell numbers in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. At 4 h blood leukogram showed increased leukocyte values with the highest neutrophilia in Tsv group. The numbers of leukocytes and neutrophils remained higher than control at 24 h in Tsv and Tbv groups, and it was accompanied by lympho (envenomed groups) and monocytosis (Tsv group). In conclusion, although Tbv was capable of inducing acute lung injury and blood leukocyte mobilization, most of the evaluated parameters were more affected by the Tsv. These results could help to explain the pathophysiology of the scorpionism and the clinical data arguing toward the greatest severity associated with T. serrulatus stings. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Microcystins (MCs) are serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitors synthesized by several members of the phylum Cyanobacteria. Mining the draft genome sequence of the nostocalean MC-producing Fischerella sp. strain CENA161 led to the identification of three contigs containing mcy genes. Subsequent PCR and Sanger sequencing allowed the assembling of its complete biosynthetic mcy gene cluster with 55,016 bases in length. The cluster encoding ten genes (mcyA-J) with a central bidirectional promoter was organized in a similar manner as found in other genera of nostocalean cyanobacteria. However, the nucleotide sequence of the mcy gene cluster of Fischerella sp. CENA161 showed significant differences from all the other MC-producing cyanobacterial genera, sharing only 85.2 to 74.1% identities. Potential MC variants produced by Fischerella sp. CENA161 were predicted by the analysis of the adenylation domain binding pockets and further investigated by LC-MS/MS analysis. To our knowledge, this study presents the first complete mcy cluster characterization from a strain of the genus Fischerella, providing new insight into the distribution and evolution of MCs in the phylum Cyanobacteria.

AB Previous studies have shown that the photodegradation of some pollutants, induced by the excited triplet states of chromophoric dissolved organic matter ((CDOM)-C-3*), can be inhibited by back-reduction processes carried out by phenolic antioxidants occurring in dissolved organic matter (DOM). Here, for the first time to our knowledge, we included such an inhibition effect into a photochemical model and applied the model predictions to sulfadiazine (SDZ), a sulfonamide antibiotic that occurs in surface waters in two forms, neutral HSDZ and anionic SDZ(-) (pK(a) = 6.5). The input parameters of the photochemical model were obtained by means of dedicated experiments, which showed that the inhibition effect was more marked for SDZ(-) than for HSDZ. Compared to the behavior of 2,4,6-trimethylphenol, which does not undergo antioxidant inhibition when irradiated in natural water samples, the back reduction effect on the degradation of SDZ was proportional to the electron-donating capacity of the DOM. According to the model results, direct photolysis and center dot OH reaction would account for the majority of both HSDZ and SDZ- photodegradation in waters having low dissolved organic carbon (DOC < 1 mgC L-1). With higher DOC values (>3-4 mgC L-1) and despite the back-reduction processes, the (CDOM)-C-3* reactions are expected to account for the majority of HSDZ phototransformation. In the case of SDZ- at high DOC, most of the photodegradation would be accounted for by direct photolysis. The relative importance of the triplet-sensitized phototransformation of both SDZ(-) and (most importantly) HSDZ is expected to increase with increasing DOC, even in the presence of back reduction. An increase in water pH, favoring the occurrence of SDZ-with respect to HSDZ, would enhance direct photolysis at the expense of triplet sensitization. SDZ should be fairly photolabile under summertime sunlight, with predicted half-lives ranging from a few days to a couple of months depending on water conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper deals with the photochemical fate of two representative carbapenem antibiotics, namely imipenem and meropenem, in aqueous solutions under solar radiation. The analytical method employed for the determination of the target compounds in various aqueous matrices, such as ultrapure water, municipal wastewater treatment plant effluents, and river water, at environmentally relevant concentrations, was liquid chromatography coupled with hybrid triple quadrupole-linear ion trap-mass spectrometry. The absorption spectra of both compounds were measured in aqueous solutions at pH values from 6 to 8, and both compounds showed a rather strong absorption band centered at about 300 nm, while their molar absorption coefficient was in the order from 9 x 10(3)-10(4) L mol(-1) cm(-1). The kinetics of the photochemical degradation of the target compounds was studied in aqueous solutions under natural solar radiation in a solar reactor with compound parabolic collectors. It was found that the photochemical degradation of both compounds at environmentally relevant concentrations follows first order kinetics and the quantum yield was in the order of 10(-3) mol einsten(-1). Several parameters were studied, such as solution pH, the presence of nitrate ions and humic acids, and the effect of water matrix. In all cases, it was found that the presence of various organic and inorganic constituents in the aqueous matrices do not contribute significantly, either positively or negatively, to the photochemical degradation of both compounds under natural solar radiation. In a final set of photolysis experiments, the effect of the level of irradiance was studied under simulated solar radiation and it was found that the quantum yield for the direct photodegradation of both compounds remained practically constant by changing the incident solar irradiance from 28 to 50 W m(-2).

AB The electrochemical degradation of tetracaine hydrochloride has been studied in urban wastewater. Treatments in simulated matrix with similar ionic composition as well as in 0.050 M Na2SO4 were comparatively performed. The cell contained an air-diffusion cathode for H2O2 electrogeneration and an anode selected among active Pt, IrO2-based and RuO2-based materials and non-active boron-doped diamond (BDD). Electrochemical oxidation with electrogenerated H2O2 (EO-H2O2), electro-Fenton (EF) and photoelectro-Fenton (PEF) were comparatively assessed at pH 3.0 and constant current density. The pharmaceutical and its byproducts were oxidized by center dot OH formed from water oxidation at the anode surface and in the bulk from Fenton's reaction, which occurred upon addition of 0.50 mM Fe2+ in all media, along with active chlorine originated from the anodic oxidation of Cl- contained in the simulated matrix and urban wastewater. The PEF process was the most powerful treatment regardless of the electrolyte composition, owing to the additional photolysis of intermediates by UVA radiation. The use of BDD led to greater mineralization compared to other anodes, being feasible the total removal of all organics from urban wastewater by PEE at long electrolysis time. Chlorinated products were largely recalcitrant when Pt, IrO2-based or RuO2-based anodes were used, whereas they were effectively destroyed by BDD(center dot OH). Tetracaine decay always obeyed a pseudo-first-order kinetics, being slightly faster with the RuO2-based anode in Cl- media because of the higher amounts of active chlorine produced. Total nitrogen and concentrations of NH4+, NO3-, ClO3-, Clog and active chlorine were determined to clarify the behavior of the different electrodes in PEF. Eight intermediates were identified by GC-MS and fumaric and oxalic acids were quantified as final carboxylic acids by ion-exclusion HPLC, allowing the proposal of a plausible reaction sequence for tetracaine mineralization by PEF in Cl--containing medium.

AB Arsenic is a carcinogenic element that exists primarily as arsenate [As(V)] and arsenite [As(III)] in the nature environment, with As(III) being more toxic and mobile of the two species. In addition, ferrihydrite, which is widely distributed in soils and aquatic environments, can catalyze the oxidation of Mn(II) and accelerate the formation of high-valence Mn, which can significantly influence the speciation, toxicity, and mobility of As when these species co-exist. In this context, we herein explored the mechanism of As(III) oxidation in the presence of ferrihydrite and Mn(II) using a kinetic approach combined with multiple spectroscopic techniques, including X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy, in situ horizontal 'attenuated total-reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and in situ quick scanning X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Our results indicate that efficient As(III) oxidation by dissolved O-2 occurs on the surface of ferrihydrite in the presence of aqueous Mn(II). Compared with As(III) oxidation in the presence of ferrihydrite and Mn oxides (i.e., Mn oxides/hydroxides), the degree of As(III) oxidation in the ferrihydrite-Mn(II) system was significantly higher, and the majority of generated As(V) was adsorbed on the mineral (i.e., ferrihydrite) surface. Furthermore, As(III) oxidation was enhanced upon increasing both the molar ratio of Mn(II)/As(III) and the solution pH. The greater As(III) oxidation by O-2 in the ferrihydrite-Mn(II) system was mainly attributed to the formation of a strong oxidant of the instantaneous intermediate Mn(III) species via Mn(II) oxidation under catalysis by the ferrihydrite surface. Moreover, As(III) oxidation occurred mainly on the ferrihydrite surface and was accompanied by the regeneration of Mn(II), thereby rendering it recyclable. These results therefore provide new insights into the mechanism of As(III) oxidation on the surfaces of Fe oxides (i.e., Fe oxides/hydroxides) in the presence of aqueous Mn(II) as well as the new details regarding the electron transfer mechanisms between the As(III)-Mn(II, III)-O-2 species at the ferrihydrite surface, and could lead to novel approaches for As(III) contaminant remediation in the environment.

AB The increasing occurrence of tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) in the environment is raising questions about its potential environmental health impacts as it has been shown to cause various deleterious effects in humans. The fact that the highest concentrations of TBBPA have been reported in wastewater sludge is concerning as effluent discharge and biosolids land application are likely a route by which TBBPA can be further disbursed to the environment. Our objectives in this study were to evaluate the effect of biochar (BC) and activated carbon (AC) in promOting the biodegradation of TBBPA, and characterize the response of anaerobic sludge microbial communities following amendments. Both carbonaceous amendments were found to promote the reductive debromination of TBBPA. Nearly complete transformation of TBBPA to BPA was observed in the amended reactors similar to 20 days earlier than in the control reactors. In particular, the transformation of diBBPA to monoBBPA, which appears to be the rate limiting step, was accelerated in the presence of either amendment. Overall, microbial taxa responding to the amendments, i.e., 'sensitive responders', represented a small proportion of the community (i.e., 7.2%), and responded positively. However, although both amendments had a similar effect on TBBPA degradation, the taxonomic profile of the sensitive responders differed greatly from one amendment to the other. BC had a taxonomically broader and slightly more pronounced effect than AC. This work suggests that BC and AC show great potential to promote the biodegradation of TBBPA in anaerobic sludge, and their integration into wastewater treatment processes may be helpful for removing TBBPA and possibly other emerging hydrophobic contaminants.

AB This study investigated the impact of coagulation-flocculation treatment on metal form and bioavailability in municipal wastewater. Real humus effluent samples were separated into particulate, colloidal and truly dissolved fractions before and after treatment with either ferric chloride (FeCl3) or the biopolymer Floculan. Results revealed that both reagents effectively (>48%) eliminated Cu, Pb and Zn from the particulate fraction and removed Cu and Zn from the colloidal fraction in conjunction with colloidal organic carbon (COC). Although organics in the truly dissolved fraction were resistant to removal, Floculan reduced Cu in this fraction by 72% owing to the complexation of free Cu ions to phenol and amino groups along the polymeric chains, revealing an additional removal pathway. In fact, COC removed in the CF process by Floculan was replaced with truly dissolved compounds, input as a result of this reagents organic composition. Floculan, therefore, reduced the soluble concentration of Cu and Zn without changing the DOC concentration, thus reducing the bioavailability of these metals in treated effluent. FeCl3 did not reduce the bioavailability of target metals, thus did not deliver any environmental benefit. This work provides important information for the selection and development of high performance coagulants to improve metal removal. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Western Mountain Aquifer (Yarkon-Taninim) of Israel is one of the country's major water resources and partially flows through a karst system. During late winter 2013, maintenance actions were performed on a central sewage pipe that caused sewage to leak into the creek located in the study area. Carbamazepine (CBZ) was used as an indicator for the presence of sewage in the groundwater. The research goal was to develop a mathematical model for quantifying flow and contaminant transport processes in the karst/fractured-porous unsaturated zone and groundwater system. The model was used to simulate CBZ transport during and after an observed sewage leakage event. A quasi-3D dual permeability numerical model represents the 'vadose zone aquifer' system, by a series of 10 vertical flow and transport equations solved in a variably-saturated zone and by 3D-saturated flow and transport equation in groundwater. The results of simulation showed that after the leakage stopped, significant amounts of CBZ were retained in the porous matrix of the unsaturated zone below the creek. Water redistribution and slow recharge during the dry summer season contributed to a continuous supply of CBZ to the groundwater in the vicinity of the creek and hundreds of meters downstream.

AB This study evaluates various options for full-scale modular configuration of forward osmosis (FO) process for osmotic dilution of seawater using wastewater for simultaneous desalination and water reuse through FO-reverse osmosis (RO) hybrid system. Empirical relationship obtained from one FO membrane element operation was used to simulate the operational performances of different FO module configurations. The main limiting criteria for module operation is to always maintain the feed pressure higher than the draw pressure throughout the housing module for safe operation without affecting membrane integrity. Experimental studies under the conditions tested in this study show that a single membrane housing cannot accommodate more than four elements as the draw pressure exceeds the feed pressure. This then indicates that a single stage housing with eight elements is not likely to be practical for safe FO operation. Hence, six different FO modular configurations were proposed and simulated. A two-stage FO configuration with multiple housings (in parallel) in the second stage using same or larger spacer thickness reduces draw pressure build-up as the draw flow rates are reduced to half in the second stage thereby allowing more than four elements in the second stage housing. The loss of feed pressure (pressure drop) and osmotic driving force in the second stage are compensated by operating under the pressure assisted osmosis (PAO) mode, which helps enhance permeate flux and maintains positive pressure differences between the feed and draw chamber. The PAO energy penalty is compensated by enhanced permeate throughput, reduced membrane area, and plant footprint. The contribution of FO/PAO to total energy consumption was not significant compared to post RO desalination (90%) indicating that the proposed two-stage FO modular configuration is one way of making the FO full-scale operation practical for FO-RO hybrid system.

AB The performance of a biomass adapted to Oncological Ward Wastewater (OWW) in a membrane bioreactor (MBR) was compared with that of a municipal WWTP, on the removal of pharmaceutical molecules and more specifically on their overall resistance and purifying ability in the presence of pharmaceutical cocktails. Sorption and biotransformation mechanisms on two antineoplastics, one antibiotic and a painkiller were evaluated. Sludge acclimated to OWW allowed for a 34% increase in the removal rate and in the minimum inhibition concentration. The percentage of the amounts of specific pharmaceutical compounds removed by biotransformation or by sorption were measured. These results are positive, as they show that the observed removal of pharmaceutical molecules by biomass acclimated to OWW can mostly be attributed to developed biotransformation, unlike the biomass from the municipal WWTP for which sorption is sometimes the only removal mechanism. The biotransformation kinetic and the solid-water distribution coefficients in this study show good agreement with literature data, even for much higher pharmaceutical concentrations in OWW.

AB Temperature change and eutrophication are known to affect phytoplankton communities, but relatively little is known about the effects of interactions between simultaneous changes of temperature and nutrient loading in coastal ecosystems. Here we show that such interaction is key in driving diatomdinoflagellate dynamics in the East China Sea. Diatoms and dinoflagellates responded differently to temperature, nutrient concentrations and ratios, and their interactions. Diatoms preferred lower temperature and higher nutrient concentrations, while dinoflagellates were less sensitive to temperature and nutrient concentrations, but tended to prevail at low phosphorus and high N:P ratio conditions. These different traits of diatoms and dinoflagellates resulted in the fact that both the effect of warming resulting in nutrients decline as a consequence of increasing stratification and the effect of increasing terrestrial nutrient input as a result of eutrophication might promote dinoflagellates over diatoms. We predict that conservative forecasts of environmental change by the year 2100 are likely to result in the decrease of diatoms in 60% and the increase of dinoflagellates in 70% of the surface water of the East China Sea, and project that mean diatoms should decrease by 19% while mean dinoflagellates should increase by 60% in the surface water of the coastal East China Sea. This analysis is based on a series of statistical niche models of the consequences of multiple environmental changes on diatom and dinoflagellate biomass in the East China Sea based on 2815 samples randomly collected from 23 cruises spanning 14 years (2002-2015). Our findings reveal that dinoflagellate blooms will be more frequent and intense, which will affect coastal ecosystem functioning. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Desalinated domestic wastewater is an indispensable water resource in arid regions; however, its recovery can be limited by calcium phosphate scaling and fouling of the membrane. Here we investigated calcium phosphate mineralization on oligoamide surfaces that mimics reverse osmosis (RO) and nano filtration (NF) membrane surfaces. We used a solution that simulates desalination of secondary treated domestic wastewater effluents for calcium phosphate mineralization experiments with oligoamide-coated gold surfaces. Attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and energy dispersive spectrometry showed that calcium phosphate and carbonate precipitated on RO mimetic surfaces. The rate of precipitation on oligoamide sensors was monitored by a quartz crystal microbalance, showing that scaling was more intense on the RO than the NF mimetic surface and that excessive carboxyl functional groups on both surfaces promoted scaling. Filtration experiments of similar solutions with commercial membranes showed that scaling was more intense on the RO membranes than on the NF membranes, which supported the results obtained with the oligoamide model surfaces. The results of this study can be implemented in developing RO and NF membranes to prevent calcium phosphate scaling and consequently lower water-treatment costs of domestic wastewater treatment.

AB To establish the association between microbial indicators and the presence of foodborne pathogens in irrigation water, Escherichia coli was enumerated using two quantification methods (plate counts and PMA-qPCR) and presence/absence of pathogenic microorganisms, including five strains from the Shiga toxigenic E. coli (0157:H7, 026, 0103, 0111 and 0145) and Salmonella spp. were evaluated. The results confirmed that surface water can be considered a microbial hazard when used for irrigation. The levels of viable E. coli were very similar to those of cultivable E. coli, except for irrigation water obtained from water reservoirs. Comparison between the E. coli counts in samples positive and negative for the presence of pathogenic bacteria for the evaluated water sources identified E. coli level of 2.35 log cfu/100 mL as a cut-off able to correctly predict positive and negative samples with 93% sensitivity and 66% specificity, respectively. Thus, for the samples with levels of E. coli under 2.35 log cfu/100 mL (e.g., 2.24 log cfu/100 mL) there was a 90% probability that the samples were not contaminated with pathogenic microorganism in locations with similar prevalence. E. coli levels in irrigation water were affected by the ambient temperature confirming that water source and climate conditions should be taken into account by growers when designing a sampling program and the frequency of the monitoring to make a better and more efficient use of their resources.

AB Biodegradable organic matter (BOM), found in all surface waters, is a challenge for drinking water utilities because it can lead to distribution system bio-regrowth, react to form disinfection by-products, or be a specific compound of concern: A critical review of BOM (occurrence and oxidant effects) and rapid-rate biofiltration performance (preozonation, backwashing with an oxidant, empty bed contact time (EBCT) and temperature) was carried out. An extensive literature data analysis (n = 100) found total organic carbon (TOC) in nonozonated water is comprised of 20% (median) biodegradable organic carbon (BDOC) and 3% (median) assimilable organic carbon (AOC). For ozonated waters (n = 103), these values increased to 30% (median) BDOC and 9% (median) AOC. For all operation conditions (n = 117), biofilters (12 min average EBCT) removed 12% (median) of the influent TOC with higher removals for ozonated waters, 15% (median), compared to nonozonated waters, 10% (median). As temperature increased from <= 10 degrees C to >= 20 degrees C, TOC removal increased from 10% to 17% (median). This review demonstrates biofiltration can be an efficient treatment technology to remove a portion of the BOM from the filter influent and should be optimized to achieve maximum removal.

AB Dairy cattle treated wastewaters are potential resources for production of microalgae biofuels. A study was conducted to evaluate the capability of Arthrospira platensis cultivated in dairy farm wastewater for biodiesel production. The biomass of Arthrospira platensis was found to be 4.98 g L-1 and produced 30.23 wt% lipids to dry biomass cultivated in wastewater which was found nitrogen stressed in photo bioreactor. The extracted lipid displayed a suitable fatty acid profile for biodiesel, although the content of linolenic acid was found a little higher than the standard EN14214. It was found that nitrogen stressed medium increase the total lipid content but temperature and intensities of light were the most important factors to control the quantity of linolenic acid and hence the quality of biodiesel, while the optimum CO2 helped to achieve maximum biomass and triacylglycerols. The Arthrospira platensis offer a good option for the treatment of wastewater before final discharge. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Microorganisms inhabiting filtration media of a drinking water treatment plant can be beneficial, because they metabolize biodegradable organic matter from source waters and those formed during disinfection processes, leading to the production of biologically stable drinking water. However, which microbial consortia colonize filters and what metabolic capacity they possess remain to be investigated. To gain insights into these issues, we performed metagenome sequencing and analysis of microbial communities in three different filters of a full-scale drinking water treatment plant (DWTP). Filter communities were sampled from a rapid sand filter (RSF), granular activated carbon filter (GAC), and slow sand filter (SSF), and from the Schmutzdecke (SCM, a biologically active scum layer accumulated on top of SSF), respectively. Analysis of community phylogenetic structure revealed that the filter bacterial communities significantly differed from those in the source water and final effluent communities, respectively. Network analysis identified a filter-specific colonization pattern of bacterial groups. Bradyrhizobiaceae were abundant in GAC, whereas Nitrospira were enriched in the sand-associated filters (RSF, SCM, and SSF). The GAC community was enriched with functions associated with aromatics degradation, many of which were encoded by Rhizobiales (similar to 30% of the total GAC community). Predicting minimum generation time (MGT) of prokaryotic communities suggested that the GAC community potentially select fast-growers (<15 h of MGT) among the four filter communities, consistent with the highest dissolved organic matter removal rate by GAC. Our findings provide new insights into the community phylogenetic structure, colonization pattern, and metabolic capacity that potentially contributes to organic matter removal achieved in the biofiltration stages of the full-scale DWTP.

AB Understanding pathogen risks is a critically important consideration in the design of water treatment, particularly for potable reuse projects. As an extension to our published microbial risk assessment methodology to estimate infection risks associated with Direct Potable Reuse (DPR) treatment train unit process combinations, herein, we (1) provide an updated compilation of pathogen density data in raw wastewater and dose-response models; (2) conduct a series of sensitivity analyses to consider potential risk implications using updated data; (3) evaluate the risks associated with log credit allocations in the United States; and (4) identify reference pathogen reductions needed to consistently meet currently applied benchmark risk levels. Sensitivity analyses illustrated changes in cumulative annual risks estimates, the significance of which depends on the pathogen group driving the risk for a given treatment train. For example, updates to norovirus (NoV) raw wastewater values and use of a NoV dose-response approach, capturing the full range of uncertainty, increased risks associated with one of the treatment trains evaluated, but not the other. Additionally, compared to traditional log-credit allocation approaches, our results indicate that the risk methodology provides more nuanced information about how consistently public health benchmarks are achieved. Our results indicate that viruses need to be reduced by 14 logs or more to consistently achieve currently applied benchmark levels of protection associated with DPR. The refined methodology, updated model inputs, and log credit allocation comparisons will be useful to regulators considering DPR projects and design engineers as they consider which unit treatment processes should be employed for particular projects.

AB It is commonly accepted that high salt concentrations negatively affect microbial activity in biological wastewater treatment reactors such as upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactors. Microbial aggregation in such reactors is equally important. It is well documented that anaerobic granules, when exposed to high salinity become weak and disintegrate, causing wash-out, operational problems and decreasing process performance. In this research, the possibility of microbial granule formation from dispersed biomass was investigated at salinity levels of 5 and 20 g Na+/L. High removal efficiencies of soluble influent organics were achieved at both salinity levels and this was accompanied by fast and robust formation of microbial granules. The process was found to be stable for the entire operational period of 217 days. As far as we know this is the first time it has been demonstrated that stable granule formation is possible at a salinity level as high as 20 g Na+/L. Methanosaeta was identified as the dominant methanogen at both salinity levels. Streptococcus spp. and bacteria belonging to the family Lachnospiraceae were identified as the dominant microbial population at 5 and 20 and g Na+/L, respectively. (C) 2017 The Authors.

ID WASTE-WATER; TREATMENT-PLANT; STATE
AB Ready access to comprehensive influent information can help water reclamation plant (WRP) operators implement better real-time process controls, provide operational reliability and reduce energy consumption. The five-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), a critical parameter for WRP process control, is expensive and difficult to measure using hard-sensors. An alternative approach based on a soft sensor methodology shows promise, but can be problematic when used to predict high BOD5 values. Underestimating high BOD5 concentrations for process control could result in an insufficient amount of aeration, increasing the risk of an effluent violation. To address this issue, we tested a hierarchical hybrid soft-sensor approach involving multiple linear regression, artificial neural networks (ANN), and compromise programming. While this hybrid approach results in a slight decrease in overall prediction accuracy relative to the approach based on ANN only, the underestimation percentage is substantially lower (37% vs. 61%) for predictions of carbonaceous BOD5 (CBOD5) concentrations higher than the long-term average value. The hybrid approach is also flexible and can be adjusted depending on the relative importance between energy savings and managing the risk of an effluent violation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Capacitive deionization (CDI) is considered to be one of the most promising technologies for the desalination of brackish water with low to medium salinity. In practical applications, Faradaic redox reactions occurring in CDI may have both negative and positive effects on CDI performance. In this review, we present an overview of the types and mechanisms of Faradaic reactions in CDI systems including anodic oxidation of carbon electrodes, cathodic reduction of oxygen and Faradaic ion storage and identify their apparent negative and positive effects on water desalination. A variety of strategies including development of novel electrode materials and use of alternative configurations and/or operational modes are proposed for the purpose of mitigation or elimination of the deterioration of electrodes and the formation of byproducts caused by undesired side Faradaic reactions. It is also recognized that Faradaic reactions facilitate a variety of exciting new applications including i) the incorporation of intercalation electrodes to enhance water desalination or to selectively separate certain ions through reversible Faradaic reactions and ii) the use of particular anodic oxidation and cathodic reduction reactions to realize functions such as water disinfection and contaminant removal.

AB The efforts for implementing the anammox process at mainstream conditions with high nitrogen removal rates have gained much attention in the race for achieving an energy-positive urban wastewater treatment plant. Here, the successful and stable long-term operation of an Upflow Anammox Sludge Bed (UAnSB) reactor treating a low-strength synthetic influent amended with ammonium and nitrite for 420 days, and a nitrite-amended pre-treated real urban wastewater for 110 days at temperatures as low as 11 degrees C is presented. The short and long-term effects of temperature on anammox activity were assessed when the synthetic influent was treated, and the UAnSB reactor was demonstrated to be a robust reactor to confront low temperatures, typically found at mainstream conditions. In fact, a nitrogen loading rate as high as 1.8 +/- 0.1 g N L-1 d(-1) with 82 +/- 4% of nitrogen removal was achieved at 11 degrees C treating the low strength synthetic influent. Furthermore, the effect of treating a nitrite-amended pre-treated real urban wastewater at 11 degrees C at long-term in the UAnSB reactor was evaluated, and a stable operation was achieved with a high average nitrogen removal rate (1.2 +/- 0.5 g N L-1 d(-1)). The relative abundance of anammox bacteria was maintained higher than 70% according to fluorescence in situ hybridization during the whole operation, being Candidatus Brocadia anammoxidans the predominant microbial species. The presence of heterotrophs in the sludge bed was surmised through heterotrophic batch tests, but anammox activity was demonstrated to be higher than heterotrophic activity, even when the synthetic influent was replaced by the nitrite-amended pre-treated real wastewater. The feasibility of operating an enriched anammox reactor at high nitrogen removal rate at long-term at mainstream conditions was demonstrated in this study. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Cyanobacteria blooming is a serious environmental issue throughout the world. Removal of cyanobacterial cells from surface water with controlled release of cyanobacterial organic matter (COM), especially toxic microcystins (MCs), would potentially reduce the processing burden in follow-up water treatment. Coagulation is a key technique in water treatment. Herein, the potential application of a novel titanium xerogel coagulant (TXC) was evaluated for the treatment of cyanobacteria-laden water in terms of cyanobacteria removal efficiency, variation of cell viability, the release and evolution of COM in the floc accumulation and storage process. Under acidic to neutral conditions, TXC showed a higher removal efficiency of approximately 99% for cyanobacteria and a lower residual Ti concentration than the widely used commercial polyferric sulfate (PFS) and polyaluminum chloride (PAC). Another advantage of TXC was the reduced MCs concentration caused by the released acetylacetone (AcAc) from the hydrolysis of TXC. Under solar irradiation, AcAc degraded the extracellular MCs from an initial concentration of 40 pg/L to a residual concentration of 7 mu g/L during a 16-day floc storage process. The low residual Ti concentration (< 0.04 mg/L) and the efficient removal of COM/MCs following TXC coagulation reduced the toxicity to photobacteria. The results demonstrate that TXC is a promising dual-effect coagulant for treatment of cyanobacteria-laden water. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Chlorinated ethenes (CEs) are legacy contaminants whose chemical footprint is expected to persist in aquifers around the world for many decades to come. These organohalides have been reported in river systems with concerning prevalence and are thought to be significant chemical stressors in urban water ecosystems. The aquifer-river interface (known as the hyporheic zone) is a critical pathway for CE discharge to surface water bodies in groundwater basefiow. This pore water system may represent a natural bioreactor where anoxic and oxic biotransformation process act in synergy to reduce or even eliminate contaminant fluxes to surface water. Here, we critically review current process understanding of anaerobic CE respiration in the competitive framework of hyporheic zone biogeochemical cycling fuelled by in-situ fermentation of natural organic matter. We conceptualise anoxic-oxic interface development for metabolic and co-metabolic mineralisation by a range of aerobic bacteria with a focus on vinyl chloride degradation pathways. The superimposition of microbial metabolic processes occurring in sediment biofilms and bulk solute transport delivering reactants produces a scale dependence in contaminant transformation rates. Process interpretation is often confounded by the natural geological heterogeneity typical of most riverbed environments. We discuss insights from recent field experience of CE plumes discharging to surface water and present a range of practical monitoring technologies which address this inherent complexity at different spatial scales. Future research must address key dynamics which link supply of limiting reactants, residence times and microbial ecophysiology to better understand the natural attenuation capacity of hyporheic systems.

AB The combination of persulfates (peroxydisulfate (PDS) and peroxymonosulfate (PMS)) and electrolysis using boron-doped diamond (BDD) anode is a promising green advanced oxidation process. In comparison with electrolysis alone, electrochemical activation of persulfates at BDD anode considerably enhanced the degradation of carbamazepine (CBZ). The experimental results indicate that the surface adsorbed hydroxyl radical (HO.) played the dominant role. The generally proposed nonradical oxidation mechanism ignored hydroxyl radical (HO.) oxidation because low concentration of radical scavenger (<10 M methanol or 5 M tertbutanol) could not effectively scavenge the surface-adsorbed HO'. The quasi steady-state concentration of HO center dot was estimated to be about 5.0-9.1 x 10(-12) M for electrolysis with BDD anode, and it was increased to 1.1-1.6 x 10(-11) M and 3.2-5.0 x 10(-11) M for addition of 5 mM PDS and PMS, respectively. The results of cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronoamperometry as well as evolution of dissolved oxygen (DO) reveal that the electrochemically activated persulfates molecule (PDS*/PMS*) promoted the production of HO center dot via water dissociation at BDD anode and enhanced the direct electron transfer (DET) reaction, which otherwise inhibited the oxygen evolution side reaction. Therefore, higher current efficiency was achieved in electrochemical activation of persulfates process compared with electrolysis process. Additionally, the transformation products of CBZ were also investigated and their formation pathways were proposed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The ability of anammox bacteria to utilize organic matter has drawn extensive attention. However, the metabolic discrepancies between autotrophic and mixotrophic anammox consortia need to be further explored. Here, microbial transcript and metabolomic analysis were conducted for the samples harvested in the reactors and batch assays to investigate the phenotype discrepancies and intrinsic causes in autotrophic and mixotrophic anammox consortia. Results showed that metabolically active community structures did not show significant difference between autotrophic and mixotrophic anammox consortia (C/N = 0.3). Changes in the metabolic state were the main cause for those discrepancies in virtue of the added acetate oxidized via the acetyl-CoA pathway by mixotrophic anammox bacteria. At C/N ratio of 0.3, anammox activity was obviously promoted compared to that in the autotrophic condition, due to higher levels of NADH and NAD+, as well as ATP consumption. Mixotrophic anammox consortia were found to yield more biomass, resulting from enhanced purine, pyrimidine, and putrescine synthetic pathways for regulating bacterial growth. Up-regulated amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism pathways participating in regulating more extracellular polysaccharides secreted by mixotrophic anammox consortia. In adverse environment with higher COD concentration, more extracellular proteins were produced by anammox consortia to protect themselves and amino acids also accumulated in the cell. This study provides useful information to catch the optimal metabolism way of anammox consortia and accelerate anammox bacterial cultivation or reactor startup for wastewater treatment.

TI Impacts from urban water systems on receiving waters How to account for
   severe wet-weather events in LCA?

AB Sewage systems are a vital part of the urban infrastructure in most cities. They provide drainage, which protects public health, prevents the flooding of property and protects the water environment around urban areas. On some occasions sewers will overflow into the water environment during heavy rain potentially causing unacceptable impacts from releases of untreated sewage into the environment. In typical Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) studies of urban wastewater systems (UWS), average dry-weather conditions are modelled while wet-weather flows from UWS, presenting a high temporal variability, are not currently accounted for. In this context, the loads from several storm events could be important contributors to the impact categories freshwater eutrophication and ecotoxicity. In this study we investigated the contributions of these wet-weather-induced discharges relative to average dry-weather conditions in the life cycle inventory for UWS. In collaboration with the Paris public sanitation service (SIAAP) and Observatory of Urban Pollutants (OPUR) program researchers, this work aimed at identifying and comparing contributing flows from the UWS in the Paris area by a selection of routine wastewater parameters and priority pollutants. This collected data is organized according to archetypal weather days during a reference year. Then, for each archetypal weather day and its associated flows to the receiving river waters (Seine), the parameters of pollutant loads (statistical distribution of concentrations and volumes) were determined. The resulting inventory flows (i.e. the potential loads from the UWS) were used as LCA input data to assess the associated impacts. This allowed investigating the relative importance of episodic wet-weather versus "continuous" dry-weather loads with a probabilistic approach to account for pollutant variability within the urban flows. The analysis at the scale of one year showed that storm events are significant contributors to the impacts of freshwater eutrophication and ecotoxicity compared to those arising from treated effluents. At the rain event scale the wet-weather contributions to these impacts are even more significant, accounting for example for up to 62% of the total impact on freshwater ecotoxicity. This also allowed investigating and discussing the ecotoxicity contribution of each class of pollutants among the broad range of inventoried substances. Finally, with such significant contributions of pollutant loads and associated impacts from wet-weather events, further research is required to better include temporally-differentiated emissions when evaluating eutrophication and ecotoxicity. This will provide a better understanding of how the performance of an UWS system affects the receiving environment for given local weather conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB BACKGROUND: Tumors invading both the anterior skull base and the sinonasal area have traditionally been accessed via largely invasive open craniofacial approaches. Minimally invasive extended endoscopic endonasal approaches have recently become increasingly available but have anatomical limitations and require incremental experience and thus high patient volume. Our objective was to assess the applicability of a novel combination of the minimally invasive supraciliary incision and the limited maxillofacial osteotomy as a combined surgical approach for large tumors invading both the anterior skull base and the sinonasal area.
   METHODS: The well-established technique of supraciliary incision with a 2.5 x 3.0-cm craniotomy was combined for the first time with limited facial translocation approach.
   RESULTS: This series involves 11 cases (female/male ratio 4: 7; ranging in age from 6 to 61 years). Intracranial tumor propagation with intranasal and ethmoidal extension was detected in all patients. The pathologic diagnoses included adenocarcinomas, esthesioneuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, sinonasal papilloma, meningioma, and neurofibroma. The postoperative approach-related mortality rate was zero. No case of cerebrospinal fluid leak was detected. The 3-year survival rate was 70%.
   CONCLUSIONS: The limited transfacial approach in combination with a supraciliary extension is associated with minimal mortality and morbidity and facilitates gross total tumor removal. We highly recommend this approach for the surgical treatment of large tumors invading both the anterior skull base and the sinonasal area, especially for those being out of indication for extended endoscopic endonasal surgery.

AB BACKGROUND: In skull base tumors involving the cavernous sinus, indications for aggressive resection are sparse and must be carefully examined because of their invasiveness. With careful evaluation, techniques including internal carotid artery sacrifice with or without extracranial-intracranial bypass may still be an option in some cases. Moreover, previous surgery with the sacrifice of potential donor vessels requires adjusting the revascularization strategy. We describe an occipital artery-middle cerebral artery bypass before skull base tumor resection.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 47-year-old woman with a recurrent cavernous sinus meningioma was referred to our department. Because of tumor recurrence after radiotherapy and its rapid progression, radical resection, including part of the cavernous sinus, was planned. A balloon test occlusion was performed and showed good tolerance. An endovascular internal carotid artery occlusion was performed. The patient eventually experienced motor deficits and aphasia after surgery. Therefore, bypass surgery using an occipital arteryemiddle cerebral artery anastomosis was performed. The patient showed no exacerbation of symptoms after bypass surgery and subsequently underwent tumor resection.
   CONCLUSIONS: The reliability of balloon test occlusion in the management of giant aneurysms may not be similarly applicable to skull base tumors. If hypoperfusion symptoms occur after occlusion of the internal carotid artery, a surgical revascularization procedure should be considered because of the risk of ischemic stroke following tumor resection. For patients whose superficial temporal artery is not available, the occipital artery can be a valuable alternative donor for low-flow bypass.

AB OBJECTIVE: Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by bilateral vestibular schwannomas (VSs). NF2-associated VSs (NF2-VSs) are routinely treated with microsurgery; however, stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) has emerged as an effective alternative in recent decades. To elucidate the role of SRS in NF2-VSs, a systematic review of the literature was conducted to compare outcomes of SRS versus surgery.
   METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, and Cochrane databases were queried using relevant search terms. Retrospective studies investigating outcomes of NF2-VS patients treated with either SRS or surgery were included. Single-patient case reports were excluded. Outcome measures between the SRS and surgery groups were compared using chi(2) 2-sample tests for equality of proportions on the pooled patient data.
   RESULTS: A total of 974 patients (485 SRS, 489 surgery) were identified. The mean 5-year local control rate for SRS was 75.1%, and the mean recurrence rate for surgery was 8.1%. The mean hearing and facial nerve preservation rates were 40.1% and 92.3%, respectively, for SRS and 52.0% and 75.7%, respectively, for surgery. Rates of hearing preservation were higher after surgery than after SRS (P = 0.006), whereas rates of facial nerve preservation were higher after SRS than after surgery (P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: SRS appears to be a safe and effective alternative to surgery for NF2-VS. Although rates of hearing preservation were higher in the surgery cohorts, SRS demonstrated high rates of local control and significantly lower facial nerve complications. Certain patients may therefore benefit more from SRS than surgery.

AB BACKGROUND: Stereoelectroencephalograpy (SEEG) is a diagnostic method involving 3-dimensional exploration of brain structures using depth electrodes for locating epileptogenic foci in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. A variety of frame-based, frameless, and robotic stereotactic systems have been designed for the accurate placement of depth electrodes.
   OBJECTIVES: Using the FHC microTargeting platform as a model, we introduce a fully customized design that has all the constructive elements positioned by a computer algorithm, according to the planned trajectories, anchoring points, and anatomic constraints. All the constructive elements form a single-body fixture, which allows for the efficient implantation of multiple depth electrodes following trajectories having a wide range of orientations. We aim at evaluating the safety and accuracy of this stereotactic system in a clinical setting.
   METHODS: A total of 173 depth electrodes were implanted in 21 patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. Matlab and DEETO software packages were used to post-operatively evaluate the targeting accuracy. Automatic detection of electrode locations eliminated any subjectivity in calculating the targeting errors.
   RESULTS: As a result of using custom geometry of the stereotactic platform, the new design is optimized for each patient and streamlines the surgical procedures. The most important results characterizing the platform's accuracy are the values of 1.22 mm for the median lateral target point localization error and 1.17 mm for the median lateral entry point localization error.
   CONCLUSIONS: The patient-customized platforms are comparable in terms of safety, accuracy, and simplicity of use to the existing robotic devices for implantation of depth electrodes in patients undergoing SEEG investigations.

DE Pneumocephalus
AB A 53-year-old man was admitted to our hospital following a traffic accident. He had been riding a bicycle and was knocked down by a motorcycle, injuring the right side of his forehead. Upon arrival at our department, he was conscious and we found no cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea or otorrhea. His Glasgow Coma Scale score was 15.
   Neurologic examination was normal, except for reduced vision in his right eye. Head computed tomography showed extensive pneumocephalus involving the cisterna ambiens, prepontine and suprasellar cisterns, and temporal, frontal, parietal, and occipital lobes.
   A right frontal skull fracture was evident. The patient was treated conservatively, with bed rest with the head of the bed elevated at 30 degrees. The patient was instructed to avoid any movements that might increase intracranial pressure, and he was placed on conventional concentration oxygen therapy of about 40%. Repeat computed tomography 9 hours later showed partial absorption of the pneumocephalus, which was almost completely absorbed 4 days later. He recovered well and was discharged after 7 days. At the 1-month follow-up, the patient was well, although the reduced vision in his right eye persisted.

AB OBJECTIVE: Natalizumab, a selective adhesion molecule inhibitor binding to an alpha-4 subunit of integrin, has emerged to be an effective immunomodulator, especially in the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and Crohn disease. Recent reports documenting the development of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) as a result of its administration have been concerning, and they trigger a debate about a possible causal association. In our report, we provide a comprehensive review of the literature on lymphoma development after natalizumab use, and we report an additional case of PCNSL development in a young woman who received natalizumab for her Crohn disease.
   METHODS: A systematic (qualitative) review of literature on lymphoma development after natalizumab therapy was performed by use of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Data on patient characteristics, indication for drug therapy, dosages, radiologic findings, potential risk factors for PCNSL, and tumor markers were synthesized. Additionally, we present the findings from the case of a young woman who received natalizumab therapy (4 doses, 300 mg each) for Crohn disease and in whom PCNSL developed.
   RESULTS: Overall, 8 reports including our index case document lymphoma development after natalizumab use. Our case finding revisits the debate suggesting a remote possibility of association that warrants further evaluation and validation.
   CONCLUSIONS: Evidence documenting a causal association of natalizumab and PCNSL is weak. Considering the potential benefits of using natalizumab for current indications, we recommend vigilant monitoring of patients receiving the drug for PCNSL outlook.

TI Suturing and Dural Wrapping for a Blood Blister-Like Aneurysm on the

ID CLINICAL ANALYSIS; OUTCOMES; STENTS; WALL
AB BACKGROUND: Internal carotid artery (ICA) reconstruction is still the most effective treatment for a blood blister-like aneurysm (BBA) on the supraclinoid segment of the ICA, and clipping after wrapping has the most precise effects. However, the materials used are most often artificial. This study examined the use of autologous dura to replace the artificial materials used for wrapping after suturing a BBA.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 38-year-old man was hospitalized for subarachnoid hemorrhage. Computed tomography angiography of the head and digital subtraction angiography showed a BBA on the dorsal supraclinoid segment of the ICA. A right frontotemporal craniotomy with extradural resection of the anterior clinoid was adopted. The aneurysm was trapped with temporary clips and was found to be derived from dissection of the ICA. The separated adventitia and vascular wall were sutured to reconstruct the vascular wall first, and then the dura was cut and shaped to wrap the supraclinoid segment of the ICA. The dura was sutured onto the ICA wall to prevent dislocation. A 6-month follow-up digital subtraction angiography review showed that the supraclinoid segment of the ICA was well reconstructed, the vascular cavity exhibited slight stenosis, and BBA did not recur. Postoperative follow-up magnetic resonance imaging showed satisfying images.
   CONCLUSIONS: The method we adopted is new and showed satisfactory curative results, suggesting that ICA suturing with dura mater wrapping may become a method for the treatment of a BBA on the supraclinoid segment. The dura could potentially replace the artificial materials used for wrapping the ICA.

   INJURY
AB BACKGROUND: Current guidelines for the management of hyponatremia in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) are not based on a systematic assessment of the literature. We evaluated published studies on the efficacy and safety of current preventative and treatment strategies for hyponatremia in patients with SAH.
   METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, MEDLINE, and PubMed for relevant studies. Primary outcomes of interest included neurologic functional outcomes, symptomatic vasospasm, and others. Secondary outcomes included measures of sodium and volume status.
   RESULTS: We included 5 out of 117 identified studies: 1 before-and-after observational trial (using fludrocortisone) and 4 randomized controlled trials (2 using fludrocortisone; 2 using hydrocortisone). All 5 trials had a high risk of bias in at least 1 domain. We could not perform a meta-analysis of functional outcomes; however, individual studies did not demonstrate statistically significant differences. Mineralocorticoid use did not statistically significantly reduce the incidence of symptomatic vasospasm (relative risk, 0.60; 95% confidence interval, 0.35-1.03; I-2 = 0%). The studies did not report other primary outcomes. In the 4 RCTs, mineralocorticoid use reduced natriuresis and volume contraction.
   CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence does not demonstrate a benefit of preventative treatment with mineralocorticoids in clinically important outcomes, although a difference cannot be ruled out due to imprecision. Larger welldesigned trials are needed to establish the impact of mineralocorticoids and fluid and sodium supplementation strategies on clinically relevant outcomes in the prevention and treatment of hyponatremia in patients with SAH.

   SURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: Intracisternal papaverine (iPPV) is a vasodilator used for prophylaxis of intraoperative vasospasm during aneurysmal clipping. Postoperative side effects of iPPV include transient cranial nerve palsies, most commonly mydriasis owing to oculomotor nerve involvement, with rapid resolution.
   METHODS: We critically reviewed current literature on the adverse effects of iPPV in aneurysmal surgery with a focus on oculomotor nerve involvement. We also present the index case of prolonged bilateral mydriasis secondary to iPPV irrigation toxicity and its putative underlying mechanism.
   RESULTS: Papaverine toxicity occurs in the setting of its antimuscarinic action and blood-cerebrospinal fluid and blood-brain barrier compromise owing to acute subarachnoid hemorrhage and direct effect of papaverine. Our patient also experienced severe vasospasm and a minor stroke, both contributing to further blood-brain barrier disruption, and relatively acidic pH of the subarachnoid hemorrhage milieu.
   CONCLUSIONS: We propose that these factors perpetuate phase dynamics of papaverine crystals and facilitate a sustained slow release of papaverine within the cisternal system. Were it indicated, 0.3% iPPV would reasonably diminish the risk for neurotoxicity.

AB OBJECTIVE: Currently, there are a lack of reviews assessing the complete range of prognostic factors in skull base chordoma (SBC). This study aimed to systematically review the published literature on prognostic factors in SBC and establish pooled hazard ratios (HRs) of such factors.
   METHODS: MEDLINE and Embase searches (inception to April 4, 2017) were conducted. Two reviewers independently selected papers involving SBC prognostic factors, and studied them for methodologic quality and valuable factors. Pooled HRs and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. The main end points determined were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).
   RESULTS: Twenty-two studies with 1754 subjects were included in this systematic review. However, only 18 of the studies provided sufficient data for quantitative synthesis. Preoperative visual deficit (pooled HR, 2.77; 95% CI, 1.57-4.89 for PFS), older patient age (pooled HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.1-1.05 for PFS; pooled HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.2-1.04 for OS), and nontotal or intralesional tumor resection (pooled HR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.54-2.62 for PFS; pooled HR, 5.16; 95% CI, 2.27-11.70 for OS) were negative predictors of survival outcomes. However, adjunctive radiotherapy (pooled HR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.16-0.56) and chondroid chordoma type (pooled HR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.36-0.69) portended a favorable PFS. In addition, several prognostic biomarkers were promising.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that several clinicopathologic or molecular parameters are associated with survival up to tumor progression or mortality in SBC patients. However, further methodologically high-quality reports are still required to clarify the effects of these factors.

AB The purpose of this historical review is to summarize the work of Paul of Aegina, especially his contribution to the treatment of neurosurgical disorders and trauma. Paul performed trephinations for head injuries in the tradition of the Egyptian and the Greek schools of medicine. However, he was an innovator in the treatment of several spine injuries, as his choice to perform laminectomies and his description of them as safe and successful is unprecedented in the history of the recorded medicine and surgery. Our search of the literature shows that Paul was the first to include in his practice such a surgical technique, and, in this way, he is an innovator, since Hippocrates described the results of spine surgery as disastrous for the patient. Thus, he may be considered the historic father of spine surgery for his pioneering surgical innovations. This shows clearly that innovation in science and medicine was significantly increased through the rise of Islam and the Arabic conquest of the Middle East. The so-called "Dark Ages" were not so dark after all.

AB BACKGROUND: Craniosynostosis is a complex disease once it involves deep anatomic perception, and a minor mistake during surgery can be fatal. The objective of this report is to present novel 3-dimensional-printed polyamide craniosynostosis models that can improve the understanding and treatment complex pathologies.
   METHODS: The software InVesalius was used for segmentation of the anatomy image (from 3 patients between 6 and 9 months old). Afterward, the file was transferred to a 3-dimensional printing system and, with the use of an infrared laser, slices of powder PA 2200 were consecutively added to build a polyamide model of cranial bone.
   RESULTS: The 3 craniosynostosis models allowed fronto-orbital advancement, Pi procedure, and posterior distraction in the operating room environment. All aspects of the craniofacial anatomy could be shown on the models, as well as the most common craniosynostosis pathologic variations (sphenoid wing elevation, shallow orbits, jugular foramen stenosis). Another advantage of our model is its low cost, about 100 U.S. dollars or even less when several models are produced.
   CONCLUSIONS: Simulation is becoming an essential part of medical education for surgical training and for improving surgical safety with adequate planning. This new polyamide craniosynostosis model allowed the surgeons to have realistic tactile feedback on manipulating a child's bone and permitted execution of the main procedures for anatomic correction. It is a low-cost model. Therefore our model is an excellent option for training purposes and is potentially a new important tool to improve the quality of the management of patients with craniosynostosis.

AB BACKGROUND: Currently, the mainstay treatment of dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF) involves endovascular approaches, especially for high-grade lesions. Transarterial embolization with preservation of venous sinuses has become the preferred approach due to the development of newer liquid embolic agents. For further precision during embolization, the use of temporary balloon occlusion to protect the patency of dural sinuses from the embolic agent's migration has been described.
   METHODS: A 64-year-old man presented with bilateral pulsatile tinnitus and visual decline. A diagnostic cerebral angiogram demonstrated a complex bilateral Borden type II and Cognard type IIB DAVF. Treatment was carried out endovascularly under general anesthesia in a staged fashion. In the first stage, the balloon was inflated during embolization to protect the right transverse sigmoid venous sinus system and torcula. In the second stage, the balloon was again inflated to protect the left transverse sigmoid venous sinus system and torcula during embolization. Complete obliteration of the left DAVF was achieved, and patency of the left transverse and sigmoid sinuses was preserved. Patency of the right transverse and sigmoid sinus was also conserved post procedure.
   RESULTS: The patient was treated successfully with transarterial Onyx embolization with transvenous balloon protection of the sinus.
   CONCLUSIONS: This case is the first reported use of the Copernic RC balloon in the United States under the compassionate use guidelines of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The use of this balloon is becoming a useful treatment alternative in selected cases of DAVFs as it improves the safety and efficacy of transarterial embolization as evidenced in this case.

AB OBJECTIVE: Spaceflight and the associated gravitational fluctuations may impact various components of the central nervous system. These include changes in intracranial pressure, the spine, and neurocognitive performance. The implications of altered astronaut performance on critical spaceflight missions are potentially significant. The current body of research on this important topic is extremely limited, and a comprehensive review has not been published. Herein, the authors address this notable gap, as well as the role of the neurosurgeon in optimizing potential diagnostic and therapeutic modalities.
   METHODS: A literature search was conducted using the PubMed, EMBASE, and Google Scholar databases, with no time constraints. Significant manuscripts on physiologic changes associated with spaceflight and microgravity were identified and reviewed. Manifestations were separated into 1 of 3 general categories, including changes in intracranial pressure, the spine, and neurocognitive performance.
   RESULTS: A comprehensive literature review yielded 27 studies with direct relevance to the impact of microgravity and spaceflight on nervous system physiology. This included 7 studies related to intracranial pressure fluctuations, 17 related to changes in the spinal column, and 3 related to neurocognitive change.
   CONCLUSIONS: The microgravity environment encountered during spaceflight impacts intracranial physiology. This includes changes in intracranial pressure, the spinal column, and neurocognitive performance. Herein, we present a systematic review of the published literature on this issue. Neurosurgeons should have a key role in the continued study of this important topic, contributing to both diagnostic and therapeutic understanding.

ID CENTRAL VENOUS CATHETERS; HYDROCEPHALUS; TIP
AB BACKGROUND: Ventriculoatrial (VA) shunt is a routine technique for the treatment of hydrocephalus. The correct position at the superior vena cava-right atrium junction is generally assessed by radiography. We present the first experience of an alternative, nonradiographic technique to assess the distal end of the VA shunts through an electrocardiographic (EKG) method. The technique has developed from the large experience of central venous catheters (CVC) worldwide; the EKG-guided method is a common and validated alternative to standard radiologic control of the location of the tip of any CVC.
   METHODS: Five consecutive patients underwent VA shunt with venous catheter positioned with the EKG-guided technique. The position of the catheter tip was verified by standard chest radiography.
   RESULTS: Four men and 1 woman (mean age, 45.4 years) underwent VA shunt for hydrocephalus with the EKG-guided technique. The side of internal jugular vein puncture was the right side in 4 cases and the left side in 1 case. As confirmed by radiography, all VA shunt tips were located within the correct range. There was no radiologic evidence of procedure-related complication or catheters that had to be replaced.
   CONCLUSIONS: The EKG-guided technique for VA shunts is as accurate as fluoroscopy, but simpler, more readily available, less expensive, safer, and more cost effective. It reduces the need of radiography and radiologic exposition for both patients and operators. The EKG method may be a valid and cost-effective alternative to standard radiologic control in VA shunts, as for any central venous access device, and could become the preferential method for confirming tip position during VA shunt surgery.

   DIAGNOSIS; ADMISSION
AB INTRODUCTION: Prediction of vasospasm after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) remains imperfect and currently relies on clinical and radiographic characteristics. Whether early hemodynamic changes may refine risk stratification for delayed vasospasm (DV) after aSAH was analyzed.
   METHODS: Patients with aSAH (n = 53) and a control group with unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIA) (n = 12) with initial color-coding angiography at admission were included in this study (n = 65). Clinical and radiologic data were collected, and uni-and multivariate analysis was used to correlate the occurrence of DV (manifesting clinically or detected with transcranial Doppler or angiography) with hemodynamic features of the initial angiography including Tmax and mean transit times (MTTs).
   RESULTS: In the aSAH patient cohort, 37 of 53 patients with aSAH (70%) developed DV. After we controlled for the effects of age, Hunt and Hess grade, and modified Fisher grade, patients with DV had a shorter mean region of interest peak time (Tmax) of the anterior cerebral artery A2 segment (P = 0.036) and the middle cerebral artery M1 (P = 0.045) and M3 (P = 0.013) segments. Mean MTTs between internal carotid artery to middle cerebral artery M3 segment (P = 0.026) was also significantly shorter in patients with DV when compared with controls.
   CONCLUSIONS: Tmax and MTT on angiography within 48 hours of aneurysm rupture before treatment provide an early quantitative assessment in patients with aSAH and in this small study were predictive for the development of subsequent symptomatic DV. Early identification of patients with aSAH at greatest risk of DV may ameliorate clinical outcome through timely, selective implementation of aggressive prophylactic therapy to prevent the effects of DV.

AB BACKGROUND: The incidence of venous thromboembolism (VT) in neurosurgical practice is astonishingly high, representing a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Prophylaxis strategies include elastic stockings, low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), and intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) devices.
   OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety and efficacy of 2 different VT prophylaxis protocols implemented in a European neurosurgical center.
   METHODS: All patients admitted for neurosurgical intervention between 2012 and 2016 were stratified as low, moderate, and high risk of VT and received a combination of elastic stockings and LMWH. The protocol was modified in 2014 with the inclusion of perioperative IPC devices for all patients and only in the high-risk group also postoperatively.
   RESULTS: At time of post-hoc analysis, data obtained from patients included in this study before 2014 (Protocol A, 3169 patients) were compared with those obtained after the introduction of IPC (Protocol B, 3818 patients). Among patients assigned to protocol A, 73 (2.3%) developed deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) and 28 (0.9%) developed pulmonary embolism (PE), 9 of which were fatal (0.3%). Among patients assigned to protocol B, 32 developed DVT (0.8%) and 7 (0.18%) developed PE, with 2 eventually resulting in the death of the patient. A post-hoc analysis confirmed that the use of preoperative LMWH was not associated with a statistically significant greater risk of postoperative bleeding.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study, despite its limitations of the nonrandomized design, seems to suggest that perioperative IPC devices are a non-negligible support in the prophylaxis of clinically symptomatic DVT and PE.

AB OBJECTIVE: The most common birth-associated head injuries during vaginal delivery are cephalhematomas and subgaleal hematomas. Cranial injuries are rarely encountered. The neonate cranium is soft and pliable, and greenstick skull fractures (GSFs) are expected to be more frequent than linear or depressed fractures, but they are extremely difficult to detect with simple skull radiography. As a result, no reports have been issued on this topic to date. Recent reports suggest that technological advances in 3-dimensional (3D) computed tomography (CT) have successfully enhanced the diagnostic accuracy for cranial fractures. The authors researched the types and characteristics of GSFs and the diagnostic accuracy of 3D CT for cranial fractures in neonates.
   METHODS: The simple skull radiographs and 3D CT images of 101 neonates were retrospectively evaluated and compared with respect to diagnosis of cranial fractures, and skull GSFs were classified on the basis of 3D CT findings into 5 types depending on multiplicity and location.
   RESULTS: 3D CT detected 88 cases of cranial fractures, that is, 89 GSFs, 4 combined GSFs and linear fractures, and 3 combined GSFs and depressed fractures. The diagnostic rate of 3DCT was 91% and this was significantly higher than the 13% rate of simple skull radiographs (P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: GSFs rather than linear fractures were found to account for most cranial injuries among neonates. The diagnostic accuracy of 3D CT was considerably superior than simple skull radiography, but the high radiation exposure levels of 3D CT warrant the need for development of a modality with lower radiation exposure.

AB BACKGROUND: The age of closure of skull base synchondroses has never been analyzed in a homogenous population of children with Crouzon syndrome.
   METHODS: A retrospective case-control study was performed on 30 Crouzon children (17 male, 13 female) aged 1 month to 12.48 years with Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor type 2 mutation. Eleven synchondroses were analyzed on millimetric computed tomodensitometric slices before surgery. Syndromic patients were compared with a series of 235 healthy children previously published.
   RESULTS: Synchondrosis closure follows a global pattern that occurs earlier in Crouzon syndrome than in controls (P <= 0.002). Synchondrosis fusion starts at 10 months of age with posterior intraoccipital synchondroses and lambdoid sutures, followed by occipitomastoid synchondroses between 1.85 (right) and 2.27 years (left) and anterior intraoccipital synchondroses at approximately 2.80 years. Time to complete fusion varies considerably according to the synchondroses. Spheno-occipital and petro-occipital synchondroses fuse last, at approximately 3 years old.
   CONCLUSIONS: In children with Crouzon syndrome, synchondrosis closure occurs prematurely, with a time course specific to each synchondrosis.

   PREDICTORS; PAINDETECT; MANAGEMENT; EFFICACY; LEVEL
AB BACKGROUND: Lumbar sympathetic neurolysis (LSN) is a treatment option for complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). We examined whether LSN-related temperature changes are associated with clinical outcome and investigated relationships between the outcome of LSN and clinical variables in patients with CRPS-I.
   METHODS: We included 95 patients with CRPS-I affecting a single lower extremity, by the Budapest criteria, and who underwent LSN after successful lumbar sympathetic blocks, in this retrospective study. Fluoroscopy-guided LSN was conducted with 1.5 mL of 99% alcohol at L2 and L3 vertebral levels. Positive outcome was defined as a reduction of >= 50% on a numeric rating scale pain score at 6 months after LSN. The relationship between successful outcome and clinical variables was analyzed.
   RESULTS: Positive LSN outcome occurred in 49.5% of patients, and it was suggested that Sympathetically maintained pain may accompany CRPS-I in 28% of patients. The overall temperature in the affected limb was increased after LSN, without contralateral limb temperature changes, but did not differ significantly between the positive and negative outcome groups (P = 0.590). Temperature after LSN in warm-type CRPS was reduced in the affected limb, without contralateral limb temperature changes. The absolute temperature change was significantly greater in cold-type than in warm-type CRPS (P = 0.026). In multivariate analysis, a short duration of pain and concurrent cold intolerance were significant factors predicting a positive outcome after LSN.
   CONCLUSIONS: LSN may be effective in some patients with CRPS, irrespective of temperature changes and temperature asymmetry pattern. A short duration of pain and concurrent cold intolerance significantly predict successful LSN.

TI Effect of Tranexamic Acid on Prevention of Hemorrhagic Mass Growth in
   Patients with Traumatic Brain Injury
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Intracranial hemorrhage; Tranexamic acid; Traumatic brain injury
ID HEAD-INJURY
AB BACKGROUND: Intracranial hemorrhage is a common complication of traumatic brain injury (TBI). The purpose of this study is evaluation of the effect of tranexamic acid (TXA) on hemorrhagic mass growth in TBI patients.
   PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this randomized, doubleblind clinical trial, 149 patients with TBI and any kind of blood on their computed tomography scan enrolled in the study and were randomly allocated to receive TXA or placebo. After 24 hours, computed tomography scan was repeated for assessing the changes in hemorrhage, new bleeding, and mass effects of blood on brain tissue. The primary outcome was growth of the hemorrhagic lesion. Data were analyzed by SPSS software using Fisher exact, chi-square, and Mann-Whitney U tests, as well as linear and logistic regression models.
   FINDINGS: The incidence of hemorrhagic lesion growth was 20.5% in the TXA group and 22.7% in the placebo group. The difference was not significant (P = 0.87, RR = 0.89). The mean (standard deviation) of hemorrhagic lesion growth was 9.4 (15.3) in the TXA group and 10.2 (10.1) in the placebo group without significant difference (P =d 0.27). The frequency of deaths (2.7% vs. 4%), adverse outcome at discharge (10.8% vs. 17.3%), and 3 months later (6.8% vs. 14.7%) in the TXA group were lower than the placebo, but the difference was not statistically significant. No side effect was observed with the administration of TXA.
   CONCLUSION: Administration of a short dose of TXA does not lead to significant prevention of growth of posttraumatic hemorrhagic lesion or improvement of clinical outcomes.

AB BACKGROUND: Recent studies have shown higher accuracy rates of image-guided pedicle screw placement compared to freehand (FH) placement. However, data focusing on the impact of spinal navigation on the rate of revision surgeries caused by misplaced pedicle screws (PS) are scarce.
   OBJECTIVE: This study is aimed at identifying the rate of revision surgeries for misplaced PS comparing three-dimensional (3D) fluoroscopy navigation (3DFL) with FH PS placement.
   METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted of 2232 patients (mean age, 65.3 +/- 13.5 years) with 13,703 implanted PS who underwent instrumentation of the thoracolumbar spine between 2007 and 2015. Group 1 received surgery with use of 3DFL (January 2011 to December 2015), group 2 received surgery in the FH technique (April 2007 to December 2015). Because the use of 3DFL was initiated in January 2011, the examined period for 3DFL-navigated surgeries is shorter. Patients routinely received postoperative computed tomography scans and/or intraoperative control 3D scans.
   RESULTS: There was an overall rate of revision surgeries for malpositioned PS of 2.9%. In the 3DFL group, the rate of secondary revision surgeries was significantly lower with 1.35% (15/1112 patients) compared to 4.38% (49/1120 patients) in the FH group, respectively (odds ratio, 3.35; P < 0.01).
   Of all PS in the 3DFL group (30/7548 PS), 0.40% needed revision surgery (P < 0.01) compared to 1.14% in the FH group (70/6155 PS).
   CONCLUSIONS: We were able to show that the use of 3DFL-navigated PS placement significantly reduces the rate of revision surgeries after posterior spinal instrumentation compared to freehand PS placement.

AB INTRODUCTION: Standalone cages have gained popularity because of their ease of implantation, reduced operating time, and lower profile compared with traditional plate and cage systems. The aim of this study was to compare the risk of chronic dysphagia between those who undergwent anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) with traditional plating techniques and those who underwent standalone procedures.
   MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between 2014 and 2015, we identified 377 consecutive patients who met the study criteria (standalone, n = 211; plate-cage, n = 166). Patient-specific characteristics and surgical characteristics were collected preoperatively. In addition, the Dysphagia Disability Index (DDI) was collected 2 years postoperatively by telephone interview.
   RESULTS: Among the patients who underwent a standalone procedure, 84% (n = 177) were available for their 2-year follow-up visit in comparison with 75% (n= 124) for plate-cage procedures. There was no statistically significant difference in postoperative DDI scores between the 2 groups, controlling for prior surgery and smoking. However, the strongest risk factors for higher DDI scores were prior cervical surgery (mean 6.0 points higher) and smoking (mean 6.2 points higher). Twenty-seven patients (8.9%) experienced chronic dysphagia. The risk was higher in the plate-cage group (n = 15, 12.1%) than in the standalone group (n = 12, 6.7%), but this difference did not reach statistical significance.
   CONCLUSION: Despite similar mean DDI scores, patients who undergo anterior cervical discectomy with a plate-cage may be at a higher risk for chronic dysphagia than are those with a standalone approach, but further studies with larger sample sizes are necessary to establish this relationship with greater confidence.

AB OBJECTIVE: The best technique for the first attempt at mechanical thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke is a still matter of debate. In this study, we evaluate the efficacy of a stent-retrieving into an aspiration catheter with proximal balloon (ASAP) technique that uses a series of thrombus extraction by withdrawing the stent retriever into the aspiration catheter and continuous aspiration from the aspiration catheter at the first attempt.
   METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 42 consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke caused by occlusions in the anterior circulation who were treated with the ASAP technique at our institution. Preoperative patient characteristic, including age, thrombus location, Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score, National Institutions of Health Stroke Scale, and time from onset to puncture; postoperative Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction score; modified Rankin Scale score after 3 months; time from puncture to recanalization; the number of passes to achieve recanalization; and procedural complications, including intracranial hemorrhage, embolization to new territory, and distal embolization, were assessed.
   RESULTS: A Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction score of 2B or 3 was achieved in 40/42 patients (95.2%). Average time from puncture to the final recanalization was 21.5 minutes. Recanalization was achieved in a single attempt in 31 patients (77.5%). Embolization to new territory was observed in only 2 patients (4.8%); no patient developed distal embolization or intracranial hemorrhage including asymptomatic subarachnoid hemorrhage. Thirty-two patients (76.2%) achieved modified Rankin Scale scores of 0-2 at 3 months postoperatively.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our ASAP technique showed fast recanalization, minimal complications, and good clinical outcomes in this case series.

AB BACKGROUND: Hydrocephalus is a frequently encountered complication in the context of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). Here, we performed an external validation of the recently proposed post-subarachnoid shunt scoring (PS3) system, which aims to stratify patients presenting with aSAH based on their relative risk of requiring ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt insertion.
   METHODS: A retrospective review of all patients presenting with aSAH to our institution between July 2007 and December 2016, who underwent computed tomography imaging at the time of hospital admission, was performed.
   RESULTS: A total of 242 patients (66.1% women) with aSAH were included in the analysis with a mean age of 55.6 years. Sixty-four (26.4%) patients had a Hunt and Hess grade of 4 or 5 on admission. An external ventricular drain (EVD) was placed in 130 (53.7%) patients during the hospital admission. EVD placement was found to correlate with an increased rate of VP shunt placement (P < 0.001), and a trend toward an association between a high Hunt and Hess grade and VP shunt placement was observed (P = 0.05). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the PS3 system was found to be 0.845. The system reliably predicted shunt-dependent chronic hydrocephalus in our patient cohort (odds ratio, 3.36; 95% confidence interval, 2.31e4.89; P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: Data from this study validated the previously proposed PS3 system, which was found to more accurately predict shunt-dependent chronic hydrocephalus in patients with aSAH compared with other such systems in the neurosurgical literature, such as the chronic hydrocephalus ensuing from SAH score, Barrow Neurological Institute, and shunt dependency in aSAH systems.

AB BACKGROUND: Efforts to address resident errors and to enhance patient safety have included systemic reforms, such as the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education's (ACGME's) mandated duty-hour restrictions, and specialty-specific initiatives such as the neurosurgery Milestone Project. However, there is currently little data describing the basis for these errors or outlining trends in neurosurgical resident error.
   METHODS: An online questionnaire was distributed to program directors of 108 U.S. neurosurgery residency training programs to assess the frequency, most common forms and causes of resident error, the resulting patient outcomes, and the steps taken by residency programs to address these errors.
   RESULTS: Thirty-one (28.7%) responses were received. Procedural/surgical error was the most commonly observed type of error. Transient injury and no injury to the patient were perceived to be the 2 most frequent outcomes. Inexperience or resident mistake despite adequate training were cited as the most common causes of error. Twenty-three (74.2%) respondents stated that a lower post graduate year level correlated with an increased incidence of errors. There was a trend toward an association between an increased number of residents within a program and the number of errors attributable to a lack of supervision (r = 0.36; P = 0.06). Most (93.5%) program directors do not believe that mandated duty-hour restrictions reduce error frequency.
   CONCLUSIONS: Program directors believe that procedural error is the most commonly observed form of error, with post graduate year level believed to be an important predictor of error frequency. The perceived utility of systemic reforms that aim to reduce the incidence of resident error remains unclear.

AB OBJECTIVE: The minimum and essential thalamic areas for reducing tremor were investigated in cases treated by superselective thalamotomy in the most lateral part of the ventralis intermedius nucleus (mlp-VIM).
   METHODS: Stereotactic superselective VIM thalamotomy with depth microrecording was performed in 21 patients with essential tremor (ET) and 15 patients with tremor-dominant Parkinson disease (PD). A very small and narrow (axial plane) therapeutic lesion was formed as a square on the sagittal plane and inverse V on the axial plane in the mlp-VIM, which covered the kinesthetic response area topographically related to tremor. Patients with ET were followed up for 4.7 +/- 3.0 years and patients with PD for 7.9 +/- 3.9 years.
   RESULTS: Almost complete tremor control was achieved in all patients immediately after surgery and continued for up to 8 years. A few adverse events were recognized but disappeared within 1 month without 1 patient with thalamic hemorrhage. The medial border of the therapeutic lesion was significantly more lateral in both patients with ET and patients with PD than the calculated standard target point and was in patients with PD than in patients with ET. The mean width was only about 2.4 mm. The individual differences of the adequate location of the therapeutic lesion were significantly greater in the ET than in the PD group.
   CONCLUSIONS: The important area for reducing tremor was small and narrow and was located in the mlp-VIM, where the proprioceptive ascending signals from the tremor-dominant body part are conducted. Superselective thalamotomy in the mlp-VIM was safe and effective for the long-term in patients with ET and PD.

ID SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE; CLINICAL-FEATURES; DIAGNOSIS; JAPAN; CHINA
AB BACKGROUND: The prevalence of aneurysm formation in adults with moyamoya disease (MMD) is approximately 14%, and it represents a major potential hemorrhagic risk. We aimed to study the characteristics of intracranial aneurysms occurring in patients with MMD. We retrospectively reviewed our 10-year experience of patients with intracranial aneurysms and a diagnosis of MMD at our hospital.
   METHODS: Imaging studies and clinical records of 211 patients who were admitted to our hospital between January 2007 and December 2016 and were diagnosed with MMD were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were divided into 2 groups: 1) MMD without intracranial aneurysms and 2) MMD with intracranial aneurysms. The 2 groups were compared using statistical analysis. Angio-graphic findings and clinical features of MMD-associated aneurysms were reviewed.
   RESULTS: There were significant differences between the 2 groups, including age and clinical presentation. Among all enrolled patients (N = 132), 11 aneurysms were discovered in 11 patients. Prevalence of intracranial aneurysms in patients with MMD was 8.3%, and the rupture rate of these aneurysms was 63.6%. We classified the 10 MMD-associated aneurysms (excluding 1 incidentally found paraclinoid aneurysm) as follows: 4 dissecting aneurysms or pseudoaneurysms and 6 hemodynamic true aneurysms.
   CONCLUSIONS: MMD-associated intracranial aneurysms frequently occur in patients presenting with hemorrhagic MMD and are associated with an extremely high rate of rupture. Long-standing hemodynamic stress as well as pathologic and anatomic factors might contribute to the formation of an aneurysm.

AB OBJECTIVE: The outcomes of recent endoscopic surgery of nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas (NFPAs) are controversial when compared with traditional microscopic surgery. We aimed to assess the outcomes of endoscopic transsphenoidal surgeries performed by 1 surgeon with 7 years of experience and elucidate the predictive factors for surgical outcomes for NFPAs.
   METHODS: We included 331 patients (155 men and 176 women) with clinical NFPAs who underwent transsphenoidal surgery because of visual symptoms by a single surgeon in Seoul National University Hospital from March 2010 to May 2016. We assessed the tumor removal rate, hormonal outcomes, visual outcomes, and complications.
   RESULTS: The gross total resection rate of endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery for NFPAs by a single surgeon was 74.9%. Cavernous sinus invasion, a high Knosp grade, large tumor size, previous surgery, and lack of surgical experience in the neurosurgeon elevated the risk for residual tumors. Visual deficits were improved in 73.4% of the patients, which was associated with tumor size, preoperative visual impairment score, previous radiation, and surgical experience. Hormonal status was improved in 15.4% and aggravated in 32.9% after surgery. There were no predictors for hormonal recovery. Transient diabetes insipidus (DI) was the most common complication (9.1%), and among these patients, 3.0% had persistent DI.
   CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery by a well-experienced surgeon was an effective and safe treatment for NFPAs, but the hormonal outcomes were not changed compared with previous reports of microscopic surgery. Large tumor size and cavernous sinus invasion were still the barriers for achieving total resection.

AB OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to report 2-year follow-up outcomes of posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) with cortical bone trajectory-pedicle screw (CS), in terms of fusion rates, clinical outcomes, surgical outcomes, and complications, and to compare these outcomes with outcomes for PLIF with conventional pedicle screw (PS).
   METHODS: We enrolled 79 patients and randomly assigned them to 2 groups (group A with PS, 39 patients; group B with CS, 40 patients), and finally 37 and 35 in group A and B were analyzed in the study. The primary outcome measure was the fusion rate, evaluated by dynamic radiographs and computed tomography scans. Secondary outcome measures included 1) patient satisfaction; 2) clinical outcomes measured with pain intensity using a visual analog scale, the Oswestry Disability Index, and 12-Item Short Form Health Survey; 3) radiologic outcomes; and 4) complications.
   RESULTS: At 2-year follow-up, the fusion rate was comparable between the PS and CS groups (35 of 37 patients in the PS group; 32 of 35 patients in the CS group; P > 0.99). The patient satisfaction rate at the 1-month follow-up was significantly greater in the CS group than in the PS group (P = 0.03); however, there was no significant difference between the groups at the 1-year and 2-year follow-ups. Clinical outcomes, radiologic outcomes, and related complications revealed no significant differences in both groups within 2 years postoperatively.
   CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that CS in single-level PLIF may be an alternative to PS.

AB OBJECTIVE: Metabolic exhaustion in ischemic tissue is the basis for a detrimental cascade of cell damage. In the acute stage of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), a sequence of global and focal ischemia occurs, threatening brain tissue to undergo ischemic damage. This study was conducted to investigate whether early therapy with moderate hypothermia can offer neuroprotection after experimental SAH.
   METHODS: Twenty male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to SAH and treated by active cooling (34 degrees C) or served as controls by continuous maintenance of normothermia (37.0 degrees C). Mean arterial blood pressure, intracranial pressure, and local cerebral blood flow over both hemispheres were continuously measured. Neurologic assessment was performed 24 hours later. Hippocampal damage was assessed by hematoxylin-eosin and caspase-3 staining.
   RESULTS: By a slight increase of mean arterial blood pressure in the cooling phase and a significant reduction of intracranial pressure, hypothermia improved cerebral perfusion pressure in the first 60 minutes after SAH. Accordingly, a trend to increased cerebral blood flow was observed during this period. The rate of injured neurons was significantly reduced in hypothermia-treated animals compared with normothermic controls.
   CONCLUSIONS: The results of this series cannot finally answer whether this form of treatment permanently attenuates or only delays ischemic damage. In the latter case, slowing down metabolic exhaustion by hypothermia may still be a valuable treatment during this state of ischemic brain damage and prolong the therapeutic window for possible causal treatments of the acute perfusion deficit. Therefore, it may be useful as a first-tier therapy in suspected SAH.

AB BACKGROUND: Intradural spinal tumors are rare and can be classified into extramedullary or intramedullary. They commonly present with symptoms such as intractable back pain or neurologic deficits. We retrospectively reviewed 91 cases of intradural spinal tumors that underwent surgery in our institution from 2011 to 2016 and assessed their clinical outcomes. The majority of intradural tumors were extramedullary (89%), and the most common pathology was schwannoma (38.5%) followed by meningioma (29.7%). Comparing extramedullary versus intramedullary tumors, both groups experienced similar improvement in neurologic status post surgery (92.6% vs. 90%, P = 0.77). We achieved gross total resection in the majority of patients with both extramedullary and intramedullary tumors (65.4% vs. 70%, P = 0.91). Patients younger than 65 years (odds ratio [OR] 4.40, confidence interval [CI] 0.72-26.9, P = 0.11) and those who had complete resection of tumor (OR 2.92, CI 0.61-14.0, P = 0.18) were associated with higher odds of improved clinical outcomes, but the results were not statistically significant. The use of intraoperative neurophysiologic monitoring was not associated with improved neurologic outcomes compared with cases where it was not used (OR 0.56, CI 0.10-3.05, P = 0.50).

AB BACKGROUND: Blood-blister aneurysms (BBAs) of the internal carotid artery (ICA) are challenging lesions with high morbidity and mortality. Both surgical and endovascular approaches have been used to treat BBAs; however, little is known about their safety and efficacy.
   OBJECTIVE: To review our experience with the treatment of BBAs and explore the optimal treatment strategy.
   METHODS: A total of 83 patients with BBAs were reviewed retrospectively. The characteristics of the patients and the aneurysms, treatment results, and follow-up outcomes were analyzed.
   RESULTS: The cohort comprised 52 females and 31 males with a mean age of 46.6 years; 33 patients were assigned to the microsurgical therapy. Subsequently, 27/33 patients underwent surgical clipping, 4/33 underwent trapping without bypass, 2/33 underwent wrapping, and 50 patients underwent endovascular therapy, including stent-assisted coiling (49 patients) and coiling (1 patient). Intraoperative rupture occurred in 14 and 4 patients in the microsurgical and endovascular groups, respectively. Ischemic events occurred in 16 and 8 patients in the microsurgical and endovascular groups, respectively. At 1-year follow-up, a favorable clinical outcome was achieved in 18 (54.5%) and 38 (76.0%) patients in the microsurgical and endovascular groups, respectively. The multivariate regression model showed that the treatment strategies, Fisher grade, and vasospasm contributed significantly to the prediction of outcome for 1 year.
   CONCLUSIONS: BBAs are challenging vascular lesions with poor prognosis. Endovascular treatment may be more effective and safer with better outcomes than surgical approaches.

AB BACKGROUND: Degree of resection and visual outcome are the main concerns in the surgical resection of tuberculum sellae meningioma (TSM). In addition to the transcranial approach (TCA), the endoscopic endonasal approach (EEA) has been used increasingly. However, the controversy regarding the optimal surgical approach is not clearly resolved.
   METHODS: We compared the surgical outcomes of each approach for TSMs from 44 patients receiving EEA and 40 patients receiving TCA in 2 institutions between 2004 and 2015. We analyzed the surgical outcomes and affecting factors for the relapse of tumor and visual outcome.
   RESULTS: Gross total resection rates and relapse-free survival were not different between the 2 groups; however, the locations of residual or recurred tumor definitely differed. All recurrences in the TCA group were in the sella turcica, whereas residual tumors in EEA group were mainly located at lateral or superior to the clinoid process. The complete or partial improvement rate of visual function in the EEA group was 97.7%, but 9 patients (23.7%) in the TCA group experienced visual deterioration after surgery. EEA and younger age (< 55 years) were associated with favorable visual outcome. Cerebrospinal fluid leakage occurred in only one case in the EEA group.
   CONCLUSIONS: Surgical approaches do not affect the gross total resection rates, but the locations of residual tumor or recurrence differ according to surgical approaches. EEA is superior to TCA in visual outcome. At least in pure TSMs, the trend seems to be shifting in favor of EEA, considering the huge difference in visual outcome.

AB BACKGROUND: Recurrent symptoms of sciatica after previous surgical intervention is a relatively common and troublesome clinical problem. Percutaneous endoscopic lumbar decompression has been proved to be an effective method for recurrent lumbar disc herniation. However, the prognostic factors and outcomes of percutaneous endoscopic lumbar reoperation (PELR) for recurrent sciatica symptoms were still unknown. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the outcomes and prognostic factors of patients who underwent PELR for recurrent sciatica symptoms.
   METHODS: From 2009 to 2015, 94 patients who underwent PELR for recurrent sciatica symptoms were enrolled. The primary surgeries include transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (n = 16), microendoscopic discectomy (n = 31), percutaneous endoscopic lumbar decompression (PELD, n = 17), and open discectomy (n = 30). The mean follow-up period was 36 months, and 86 (91.5%) patients had obtained at least 24 months' follow-up.
   RESULTS: Of the 94 patients with adequate follow-up, 51 (54.3%) exhibited excellent improvement, 23 (24.5%) had good improvement, and 7 (7.4%) had fair improvement according to modified Macnab criteria. The average re-recurrence rate was 9.6%, with no difference among the different primary surgery groups (PELD, 3/17; microendoscopic discectomy, 2/31; open discectomy, 3/30; transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion, 1/16). There was a trend toward greater rates of symptom recurrence in the primary group of PELD who underwent percutaneous endoscopic lumbar reoperation compared with other groups, but this did not reach statistical significance (P > 0.05). Multivariate analysis suggested that age, body mass index, and surgeon level was independent prognostic factors. Obesity (hazard ratio 13.98, 95% confidence interval 3.394-57.57; P < 0.001) was the risk factor affecting re-recurrence according to logistic regression analysis.
   CONCLUSIONS: PELR is a safe and effective treatment for recurrent sciatica symptoms regardless of different primary operation type. Obesity, inferior surgeon level, and patient age older than 40 years were associated with a worse prognosis. Obesity was also a strong and independent predictor of re-recurrence sciatica symptoms after percutaneous endoscopic lumbar decompression.

AB BACKGROUND: Arachnoid cyst (AC)-associated chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) differs significantly from its counterparts without AC in epidemiologic, demographic, and clinical characteristics, as well as in management and prognosis. This study was conducted to further examine the epidemiologic, demographic, and clinical characteristics; diagnosis; treatment; and prognosis of AC-associated CSDH.
   METHODS: This was a retrospective study of the medical records at the neurosurgical departments of 2 institutions along with a systematic PubMed search for relevant studies published in English or Chinese.
   RESULTS: A total of 182 patients (148 males; 81.3%) were evaluated, including 14 cases in our present series. The patients ranged in age from 1 to 80 years (mean age, 24.41 +/- 13.69 years). Among the 175 patients with adequate pre-hospital history information, 119 (68%) had a history of recent head trauma or sport-related injury. AC locations included the middle fossa and sylvian fissure in 162 cases (89.0%), cerebral convexity in 17 cases (9.3%), posterior fossa in 2 cases (1.1%), and interhemispheric fissure in 1 case (0.5%). Among the 161 patients with specific data on outcomes, 159 (98.8%) had favorable recovery, 1 patient had an evident neurologic deficit, and 1 patient died from cardiac arrest.
   CONCLUSIONS: CSDH is a rare complication in patients with intracranial AC. Male children, juveniles, and young adults with recent head trauma or sport-related injury are most commonly inflicted. Burr hole drainage is the first-choice surgical procedure in symptomatic patients and is still effective in some recurrent cases. Fenestration or resection of the AC membrane is not a requisite in patients with previous asymptomatic AC.

ID REMOVAL; MENINGIOMAS; RETRACTOR; SURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: Multiple surgical modalities have been developedl and applied for surgical excision of spinal dumbbell tumors. The microscopic minimally invasive keyhole technique has not yet been well characterized for this purpose. We report our experience with 1-stage surgical resection of both intraforaminal and extraforaminal/paraspinal components of spinal dumbbell tumors using the microsurgical keyhole technique.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 12 cases of spinal dumbbell tumors treated via 1-stage surgical resection by the same senior spinal surgeon from January 2013 to April 2017. All patients were treated surgically using the microsurgical keyhole technique through a tubular retractor. Demographic data, perioperative variables, and associated complications were recorded. The clinical outcomes were evaluated at the last follow-up using a visual analog scale and the American Spinal Injury Association scale.
   RESULTS: Mean duration of surgical resection was 184.58 minutes, and mean estimated total blood loss was 208.33 mL. The mean hospitalization time was 9.17 days. Postoperatively, 11 patients (91.67%) who originally presented with pain had a significantly lower visual analog scale score, indicating a reduction in their pain intensity. All patients demonstrated neurologic stability or improvement by 1-3 grades: 16.67% remained stable, 41.67% improved by 1 grade, 33.33% improved by 2 grades, and 8.33% improved by 3 grades.
   CONCLUSIONS: The microscopic minimally invasive keyhole technique can be used successfully for resection of spinal dumbbell tumors. Further comparative studies are warranted to demonstrate the benefits of the microsurgical keyhole technique compared with traditional open procedures for surgical resection of spinal dumbbell tumors.

AB Objective: The traditional fee-for-service approach to healthcare can lead to the management of a patient's conditions in a siloed manner, inducing various negative consequences. It has been recognized that a bundled approach to healthcare-one that manages a collection of health conditions together-may enable greater efficacy and cost savings. However, it is not always evident which sets of conditions should be managed in a bundled manner. In this study, we investigate if a data-driven approach can automatically learn potential bundles.
   Methods: We designed a framework to infer health condition collections (HCCs) based on the similarity of their clinical workflows, according to electronic medical record (EMR) utilization. We evaluated the framework with data from over 16,500 inpatient stays from Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago, Illinois. The plausibility of the inferred HCCs for bundled care was assessed through an online survey of a panel of five experts, whose responses were analyzed via an analysis of variance (ANOVA) at a 95% confidence level. We further assessed the face validity of the HCCs using evidence in the published literature.
   Results: The framework inferred four HCCs, indicative of (1) fetal abnormalities, (2) late pregnancies, (3) prostate problems, and (4) chronic diseases, with congestive heart failure featuring prominently. Each HCC was substantiated with evidence in the literature and was deemed plausible for bundled care by the experts at a statistically significant level.
   Conclusions: The findings suggest that an automated EMR data-driven framework conducted can provide a basis for discovering bundled care opportunities. Still, translating such findings into actual care management will require further refinement, implementation, and evaluation.

AB Introduction: Electronic medical records are increasingly common in medical practice. The secondary use of medical records has become increasingly important. It relies on the ability to retrieve the complete information about desired patient populations. Flow to effectively and accurately retrieve relevant medical records from large- scale medical big data is becoming a big challenge. Therefore, we propose an efficient and robust framework based on cloud for large-scale Traditional Chinese Medical Records (TCMRs) retrieval.
   Methods: We propose a parallel index building method and build a distributed search cluster, the former is used to improve the performance of index building, and the latter is used to provide high concurrent online TCMRs retrieval. Then, a real-time multi-indexing model is proposed to ensure the latest relevant TCMRs are indexed and retrieved in real-time, and a semantics-based query expansion method and a multi-factor ranking model are proposed to improve retrieval quality. Third, we implement a template-based visualization method for displaying medical reports.
   Results: The proposed parallel indexing method and distributed search cluster can improve the performance of index building and provide high concurrent online TCMRs retrieval. The multi-indexing model can ensure the latest relevant TCMRs are indexed and retrieved in real-time. The semantics expansion method and the multi factor ranking model can enhance retrieval quality. The template-based visualization method can enhance the availability and universality, where the medical reports are displayed via friendly web interface.
   Conclusions: In conclusion, compared with the current medical record retrieval systems, our system provides some advantages that are useful in improving the secondary use of large-scale traditional Chinese medical records in cloud environment. The proposed system is more easily integrated with existing clinical systems and be used in various scenarios.

AB Background: With the rapid adoption of electronic health records (EHRs), it is desirable to harvest information and knowledge from EHRs to support automated systems at the point of care and to enable secondary use of EHRs for clinical and translational research. One critical component used to facilitate the secondary use of EHR data is the information extraction (IE) task, which automatically extracts and encodes clinical information from text.
   Objectives: In this literature review, we present a review of recent published research on clinical information extraction (IE) applications.
   Methods: A literature search was conducted for articles published from January 2009 to September 2016 based on Ovid MEDLINE In-Process Sr Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, and ACM Digital Library.
   Results: A total of 1917 publications were identified for title and abstract screening. Of these publications, 263 articles were selected and discussed in this review in terms of publication venues and data sources, clinical IE tools, methods, and applications in the areas of disease- and drug-related studies, and clinical workflow optimizations.
   Conclusions: Clinical IE has been used for a wide range of applications, however, there is a considerable gap between clinical studies using EHR data and studies using clinical IE. This study enabled us to gain a more concrete understanding of the gap and to provide potential solutions to bridge this gap.

AB Though the genetic etiology of autism is complex, our understanding can be improved by identifying genes and gene-gene interactions that contribute to the development of specific autism subtypes. Identifying such gene groupings will allow individuals to be diagnosed and treated according to their precise characteristics. To this end, we developed a method to associate gene combinations with groups with shared autism traits, targeting genetic elements that distinguish patient populations with opposing phenotypes. Our computational method prioritizes genetic variants for genome-wide association, then utilizes Frequent Pattern Mining to highlight potential interactions between variants. We introduce a novel genotype assessment metric, the Unique Inherited Combination support, which accounts for inheritance patterns observed in the nuclear family while estimating the impact of genetic variation on phenotype manifestation at the individual level. High-contrast variant combinations are tested for significant subgroup associations. We apply this method by contrasting autism subgroups defined by severe or mild manifestations of a phenotype. Significant associations connected 286 genes to the subgroups, including 193 novel autism candidates. 71 pairs of genes have joint associations with subgroups, presenting opportunities to investigate interacting functions. This study analyzed 12 autism subgroups, but our informatics method can explore other meaningful divisions of autism patients, and can further be applied to reveal precise genetic associations within other phenotypically heterogeneous disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease.

AB Nowadays, digital medical imaging in healthcare has become a fundamental tool for medical diagnosis. This growth has been accompanied by the development of technologies and standards, such as the DICOM standard and PACS. This environment led to the creation of collaborative projects where there is a need to share medical data between different institutions for research and educational purposes. In this context, it is necessary to maintain patient data privacy and provide an easy and secure mechanism for authorized personnel access. This paper presents a solution that fully de-identifies standard medical imaging objects, including metadata and pixel data, providing at the same time a reversible de-identifier mechanism that retains search capabilities from the original data. The last feature is important in some scenarios, for instance, in collaborative platforms where data is anonymized when shared with the community but searchable for data custodians or authorized entities. The solution was integrated into an open source PACS archive and validated in a multidisciplinary collaborative scenario.

AB We describe the development and design of a smartphone app-based system to create inpatient progress notes using voice, commercial automatic speech recognition software, with text processing to recognize spoken voice commands and format the note, and integration with a commercial EHR. This new system fits hospital rounding workflow and was used to support a randomized clinical trial testing whether use of voice to create notes improves timeliness of note availability, note quality, and physician satisfaction with the note creation process. The system was used to create 709 notes which were placed in the corresponding patient's EHR record. The median time from pressing the Send button to appearance of the formatted note in the Inbox was 8.8 min. It was generally very reliable, accepted by physician users, and secure. This approach provides an alternative to use of keyboard and templates to create progress notes and may appeal to physicians who prefer voice to typing.

DE Temporal data analysis; CUR matrix factorization; Dimension reduction;
   Electrocardiogram
ID ECG; CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHMS; MODEL
AB In this paper, we use the CUR matrix factorization as a means of dimension reduction to identify important subsequences in electrocardiogram (ECG) time series. As opposed to other factorizations typically used in dimension reduction that characterize data in terms of abstract representatives (for example, an orthogonal basis), the CUR factorization describes the data in terms of actual instances within the original data set. Therefore, the CUR characterization can be directly related back to the clinical setting. We apply CUR to a synthetic ECG data set as well as to data from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia, MGH-MF, and Incart databases using the discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM) and an incremental QR factorization. In doing so, we demonstrate that CUR is able to identify beat morphologies that are representative of the data set, including rare-occurring beat events, providing a robust summarization of the ECG data. We also see that using CUR-selected beats to label the remaining unselected beats via 1-nearest neighbor classification produces results comparable to those presented in other works. While the electrocardiogram is of particular interest here, this work demonstrates the utility of CUR in detecting representative subsequences in quasiperiodic physiological time series.

DE Natural language processing; Semantic similarity and relatedness;
   Distributional similarity
AB This paper presents a comparison between several multi-word term aggregation methods of distributional context vectors applied to the task of semantic similarity and relatedness in the biomedical domain. We compare the multi-word term aggregation methods of summation of component word vectors, mean of component word vectors, direct construction of compound term vectors using the compoundify tool, and direct construction of concept vectors using the MetaMap tool. Dimensionality reduction is critical when constructing high quality distributional context vectors, so these baseline co-occurrence vectors are compared against dimensionality reduced vectors created using singular value decomposition (SVD), and word2vec word embeddings using continuous bag of words (CBOW), and skip-gram models. We also find optimal vector dimensionalities for the vectors produced by these techniques. Our results show that none of the tested multi-word term aggregation methods is statistically significantly better than any other. This allows flexibility when choosing a multi-word term aggregation method, and means expensive corpora preprocessing may be avoided. Results are shown with several standard evaluation datasets, and state of the results are achieved.

   monitoring

DE Patient monitoring; Drug labelling; Interface terminology;
   Immunotherapy; Drug-related side effects and adverse reactions
ID SYSTEMS
AB Introduction: Immunotherapy is effective for treating cancer, but it is also associated with a wide spectrum of adverse events. In order to detect them early, the patients need to be monitored at home, between the therapy administrations, e.g., by asking them to report outcomes, usually including symptoms and quality of life measures. For the collected data to be reusable, the symptoms need to be in a standardized form. The aim of this study is to explore the standardization of the information contained in the patient information leaflets (PILs) of immunotherapy drugs, by creating an interface terminology of immunotherapy-related adverse events, which should support a consistent collection of symptoms from the patients.
   Methods: PILs contain a significant amount of information in free text, but they mix patient-reportable and clinically assessable events. We extracted a list of patient-reportable adverse events, mapped them to reference terminologies and compared the mapping results to choose the best-performing reference terminology.
   Results: The PILs standardization led to the extraction of 151 symptoms and 424 terms, including both preferred terms and synonyms in English and Italian. Among the reference terminologies we considered, SNOMED CT allowed us to map all concepts and became, hence, the main reference terminology for the resulting interface terminology. A preliminary validation on the PIL of a new immunotherapy drug showed that our interface terminology already contained all the mentioned symptoms.
   Conclusion: PILs provide a valuable source for determining adverse events. The resulting interface terminology includes Italian and English terms for patient-reportable adverse events for five immunotherapy drugs representative of their category. Further work will be undertaken to evaluate the usability of the interface terminology and the patients' experience and satisfaction with the proposed terms, made available for example through'an app, as well as its effectiveness on data quality and quality of care.

AB Background: Various criteria have been used so far for the diagnosis of malnutrition or sarcopenia in patients suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
   Objective: To determine the prevalence of malnutrition and sarcopenia in COPD, as defined by international diagnostic criteria, and determine their relationships with raw BIA variables.
   Methods: Two-hundred and sixty-three COPD patients (185 males and 78 females) underwent both clinical examination and respiratory, anthropometric, bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA raw variables: phase angle and impedance ratio), handgrip strength (HGS), 4 m gait speed and biochemical measurements. Malnutrition and sarcopenia were diagnosed based on European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) criteria and European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP) criteria, respectively.
   Results: The overall prevalence of malnutrition and sarcopenia was 19.8% and 24.0% respectively, increasing with disease severity. The prevalence of sarcopenia was significantly higher in patients with malnutrition (71.2% vs 12.3%; p < 0.001), especially in those with systemic inflammation (cachectic patients) (85.7% vs 61.3%; p < 0.001). Malnourished patients with sarcopenia had a significant reduction in BMI, fat-free mass and HGS compared to non-sarcopenic patients. Finally, impedance ratio significantly increased and phase angle decreased in patients with severe sarcopenia and in cachectic patients.
   Conclusion: A relatively high prevalence of malnutrition and sarcopenia was found in COPD patients applying international standard criteria, with some discrepancy between the two diagnoses. In addition, clear-cut changes in raw BIA variables were observed in malnourished patients with systemic inflammation and sarcopenic patients.

AB Background: Everolimus (ERL), a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, has been used for the management of several advanced cancers. ERL frequently causes lung injury, although the clinical and radiographic features have not been clarified. The aim of this study was to assess the clinical features of ERL-induced lung injury and determine the associated risk factors.
   Methods: This single-center, retrospective study included 45 patients (29 men, 16 women; age, 12-78 years) who had received ERL at our hospital between August 2010 and March 2016. Drug-induced lung injury (DILI) was diagnosed using the Japanese Respiratory Society criteria. We obtained information regarding the clinical course, symptoms, clinical findings, blood test findings, and chest computed tomography findings from the patients' medical records. Risk factors for DILI onset were investigated using the Wilcoxon rank sum test.
   Results: Fifteen patients (33%) were diagnosed with DILI. The median time from ERL administration to DILI onset was 64 days. High Serum Krebs von den Lungen-6 (KL-6) levels and a low estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) before ERL administration were found to be significant risk factors for DILI. KL-6 and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were significantly elevated at the onset of DILI. All 15 patients recovered; 11 were without steroids.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that patients with high KL-6 levels and a low eGFR at baseline are at increased risk of ERL-induced lung injury. In addition, KL-6 and LDH may be useful biomarkers of ERL-induced lung injury.

AB Background and objectives: As for all tests, the diagnostic performances of Xpert MTB/RIF might be different in settings with different tuberculosis prevalence. Aim of the study is to evaluate the performances of Xpert MTB/RIF to diagnose tuberculosis in Brazil, where 407 culture-confirmed tuberculosis patients were retrospectively enrolled in Rio Grande do Sul, between 2015 and 2016.
   Methods: Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of the test were calculated and a logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the role played by explanatory variables in the occurrence of true positive and negative diagnostic results.
   Results: Sensitivity of Xpert MTB/RIF was 100.0%, specificity 92.8%; positive and negative predictive values were 71.4% and 100.0%, respectively. In the HIV- infected sub-group specificity was 59.3%. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, true positivity was associated with increasing age (1.0; p-value: 0.02) while true positivity and negativity were negatively associated with alcohol abuse.
   Conclusions: Xpert is sensitive and specific in the Brasilian settings.

AB Technologies for long-term delivery of aerosol medications in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease have improved over the past 2 decades with advancements in our understanding of the physical chemistry of aerosol formulations, device engineering, aerosol physics, and pulmonary biology. However, substantial challenges remainwhen a patient is required to use multiple inhaler types, multiple medications, and/or combinations of medications. Combining multiple drugs into a single inhaler while retaining appropriate dosing of the individual agents in the combination may enhance patient adherence to therapy and reduce device errors that occur when patients are using multiple inhalers. Pressurized metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) devices are widely used by patients for acute symptom relief as well as maintenance treatment, so the pMDI may be a suitable option with which to explore medication combinations. However, optimizing drug formulation remains a key challenge for pMDI delivery systems. This article introduces a new pMDI formulation approach: co-suspension delivery technology, which uses drug crystals with porous, low-density phospholipid particles engineered to deliver combinations of drugs to the airways with accurate and consistent dosing via pMDIs, independent of medication types and combinations. We describe the key characteristics of pMDIs, and discuss the rationale for the co-suspension delivery technology platform based on the limitations associated with traditional formulations. Finally, we discuss the clinical implications of co-suspension delivery technology for developing combination drug therapies administered by pMDIs. (c) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Objective: To compare the presence and extent of several high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) observations in different subtypes of rheumatoid arthritis-related interstitial lung disease (RA-ILD) and to examine associations between radiological findings, hospitalization, age, RA duration, pulmonary function tests (PFT) and survival.
   Materials and methods: HRCTs from 60 RA-ILD patients were independently evaluated and re-categorized into usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), organizing pneumonia (OP), diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and unclassified subtypes by two radiologists. The presence and extent, which was reported using a semi-quantitative scoring system, of e.g. reticulation, ground-glass opacity, honeycombing, emphysema, traction bronchiectasis and architectural distortion were further evaluated and compared between the subtypes. Associations between radiological findings and survival were identified with the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox's univariate model. The correlations between radiological findings, hospitalization, age, pack years, RA duration and PFT were calculated using Spearman's correlation coefficient.
   Results: The extents of reticulation (HR 1.144, p=0.041), traction bronchiectasis (HR 1.184, p=0.030), architectural distortion (HR 1.094, p=0.044) and the presence of pleural fluid (HR 14.969, p < 0.001) were associated with decreased survival. A negative correlation was observed between ground-glass opacity (GGO) and the duration of RA (r=-0.308, p=0.023). The extents of honeycombing (r=0.266, p=0.046), traction bronchiectasis (r=0.333, p=0.012) and architectural distortion (r=0.353, p=0.007) correlated with hospitalizations due to respiratory reasons.
   Conclusions: Many radiological findings associate with the course of the disease of RA-ILD and could potentially be useful when planning the RA treatment or evaluating the risk of death in these patients.

AB Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma (MPM) is currently an incurable cancer with a typical survival of 1 year from the time of diagnosis. The recent genomic and transcriptomic characterization of MPM presents new opportunities and challenges for MPM researchers. Recent advances in clinical and laboratory diagnostics, and proposals for an updated, data-driven, staging system, also present new challenges for clinicians and hospital services involved in MPM care. The aim of this review is first to introduce the reader to the topic of MPM, a disease that is causally linked to prior, typically occupational, exposure to asbestos fibres. Secondly, we will discuss MPM from the clinical and laboratory perspectives, including reviews of current and evolving therapies and our present understanding of the molecular basis of the disease. Finally, we will attempt to identify critical knowledge gaps that currently prevent more effective treatment, including the challenges involved in early detection and chemoprophylaxis.

AB Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a clinical syndrome that is subdivided into five groups per the World Health Organization (WHO) classification, based largely on hemodynamic and pathophysiologic criteria. WHO Group 1 PH, termed pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), is a clinically progressive disease that can eventually lead to right heart failure and death, and it is hemodynamically characterized by pre-capillary PH and increased pulmonary vascular resistance in the absence of elevated left ventricular filling pressures. PAH can be idiopathic, heritable, or associated with a variety of conditions. Connective tissue diseases make up the largest portion of these associated conditions, most commonly systemic sclerosis (SSc), followed by mixed connective tissue disease and systemic lupus erythematous. These etiologies (namely SSc and Lupus) have been grouped together as connective tissue disease-associated PAH, however emerging evidence suggests they differ in pathogenesis, clinical course, prognosis, and treatment response. This review highlights the differences between SSc-PAH and Lupus-PAH. After introducing the diagnosis, screening, and pathobiology of PAH, we discuss connective tissue disease-associated PAH as a group, and then explore SSc-PAH and SLE-PAH separately, comparing these 2 PAH etiologies.

Despite the improvements in disease-targeted therapies, PAH remains incurable and with a high mortality rate, requiring effective therapeutic strategies. Exercise training is an important adjunct non-pharmacological treatment for patients with left heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Although exercise training was discouraged in PAH because of safety concerns, recent studies support that supervised exercise training is safe and beneficial in patients with stable PAH. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these improvements are still poorly understood. This review summarizes and integrates the emerging clinical and experimental studies describing the molecular alterations related with exercise training in PAH.

AB Background and objective: Nosocomial infections following influenza are important causes of death, requiring early implementation of preventive measures, but predictors for nosocomial infection in the early stage remained undetermined. We aimed to determine risk factors that can help clinicians identify patients with high risk of nosocomial infection following influenza on admission.
   Method: Using a database prospectively collected through a Chinese national network for hospitalised severe influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 patients, we compared the characteristics on admission between patients with and without nosocomial infection.
   Result: A total of 2146 patients were enrolled in the final analysis with a median age of 36.0 years, male patients comprising 50.2% of the sample and 232 (10.8%) patients complicated with nosocomial infection. Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Staphylococcus aureus were the leading pathogens, and invasive fungal infection was found in 30 cases (12.9%). The in-hospital mortality was much higher in patients with nosocomial infection than those without (45.7% vs 11.8%, P < 0.001). Need for mechanical ventilation (OR: 3.336; 95% CI 2.362-4.712), sepsis (OR: 2.125; 95% CI 1.236-3.651), ICU admission on first day (OR: 2.074; 95% CI 1.425-3.019), lymphocytopenia (OR: 1.906; 95% CI 1.361-2.671), age > 65 years (OR: 1.83; 95% CI 1.04-3.21) and anaemia (OR: 1.39; 95% CI 1.39-2.79) were independently associated with nosocomial infection.
   Conclusion: Need for mechanical ventilation, sepsis, ICU admission on first day, lymphocytopenia, older age and anaemia were independent risk factors that can help clinicians identify severe influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 patients at high risk of nosocomial infection.

AB Background: Salivary contamination decreases the yield of identifying potential airway bacterial and fungal pathogens in routine cultures of spontaneous or induced sputum during exacerbations of airway diseases. We investigated the utility of selecting out the squamous cells from sputum using inverted microscopy.
   Methods: Sputum was obtained from fifty subjects, then divided to facilitate parallel processing of paired samples for gram-stain and semi-quantitative cultures, and quantitative cytometry.
   Results: Selective processing under inverted microscopy allowed for fewer sample rejections (2% vs. 24%) and greater culture positivity (58% vs. 24%) compared with routine practices, with significant yield of fungal organisms. While known pathogens were associated with intense sputum neutrophilia, organisms that were not routinely considered as airway pathogens were also associated with modest neutrophilia indicating that they are capable of inducing a clinically relevant cellular response.
   Conclusion: Sputum selection under inverted microscopy improves the detection of bacterial pathogens during infective exacerbations. The methods to assign pathogenicity to microbes in the airway needs to be re-visited by assessing the cellular responses that they evoke in the airways.

AB Introduction: Hemodialysis (HD) patients have altered pulmonary function and this is associated with impaired endothelial function and cardiovascular events. Respiratory muscle training (RMT) has the potential to improve cardiovascular outcomes in patients undergoing maintenance HD. Here, we evaluated the effects of RMT on endothelium/glycocalyx, oxidative stress biomarkers and pulmonary function test in HD patients.
   Methods: This is a randomized controlled clinical trial including 41 patients undergoing thrice-weekly maintenance HD. Patients were randomly assigned at a 2: 1 ratio to receive or not RMT during HD sessions for 8 weeks. Main outcomes were changes in levels of the biomarkers related to endothelium activation (vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, VCAM-1, and intercellular adhesion molecule 1, ICAM-1), glycocalyx derangement (syndecan-1), aberrant angiogenesis (angiopoietin-2) and oxidative stress (malondialdehyde) compared to baseline. Also, maximal inspiratory/expiratory pressure (MIP, MEP), Forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) were evaluated. Other outcomes included changes in functional capacity and pulmonary function test. We also performed a post-hoc analysis of plasma endothelin-1 levels.
   Results: Of 56 randomly assigned patients, 41 were included in the primary final analyses. RMT increased all pulmonary function parameters evaluated and significantly reduced plasma syndecan-1 levels at 8 weeks compared to placebo (between-group difference:-84.5; 95% CI, -148.1 to -20.9). Also, there was a reduction in plasma levels of angiopoietin-2 (between-group difference: -0.48; 95% CI, -1.03 to -0.097). Moreover, there was a significant reduction in mean blood pressure at rest (between-group difference: -12.2; 95% CI, -17.8 to -6.6) associated with a reduction in endothelin-1 levels (between-group difference: -0.164; 95% CI, -0.293 to -0.034). There was no difference regarding biomarkers of endothelial activation or oxidative stress.
   Conclusion: A short-term RMT program ameliorate FVC, FEV1 and reduces syndecan-1 and angiopoietin-2 biomarker levels. Finally, better blood pressure control was attained during training and it was associated with a reduction in endothelin-1 levels.

AB Background and objective: Bronchiectasis has been associated with increased risks of cardiovascular disease, in which early-stage endothelial dysfunction might have played pivotal roles. We aimed to investigate endothelial function in bronchiectasis patients, by measuring flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) and carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) as compared with control subjects, and to elucidate the impact of different risk factors on subclinical atherosclerosis.
   Methods: The study included 80 bronchiectasis patients and 80 age-and sex-matched healthy subjects. Vascular endothelial function was evaluated with FMD in the brachial artery in response to reactive hyperemia, and CIMT was measured with high-resolution ultrasonography. Disease severity was evaluated with Bronchiectasis Severity Index and FACED scores. Demographic, disease duration, radiology, spirometry, sputum bacteriology and systemic inflammatory indices were also assessed.
   Results: FMD was significantly lower in bronchiectasis patients than in control subjects (8.92 +/- 2.70% vs. 11.17 +/- 3.44%, P < 0.001). FMD significantly correlated with Bronchiectasis Severity Index (rho = -0.60, P < 0.001) and FACED score (rho = -0.39, P < 0.001). In multivariate regression analysis, age, body-mass index, Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization and high-resolution computed tomography scores were independent factors influencing on the FMD in bronchiectasis patients, even after adjustment for other clinical variables. No significant difference in CIMT was detected between bronchiectasis patients and healthy subjects (P > 0.05).
   Conclusions: Compared with healthy subjects, bronchiectasis patients have greater risks of endothelial dysfunction which is independent of previously well-studied risk factors, calling for the vigilance to screen early for vascular changes to minimize the future risks of cardiovascular events.

AB Background: Identifying asthma patients suitable for biologic therapy includes the assessment of blood biomarkers (IgE and eosinophils (EOS)). How they relate to each other is unclear.
   Methods: This retrospective, database study used routinely collected clinical data to identify and evaluate an asthma cohort (classification code for asthma; >= 18 years; >= 1 prescription for asthma; >= 1 estimation of serum IgE, in 2 years prior to index date). Distribution into high and low IgE and EOS groups (IgE cut-point:> or <= 75 kU/L; EOS cut point:> or <= 400 mu/L), and characteristics by group are described.
   Findings: In patients with severe asthma (British Thoracic Society Step (BTS) > 4; N = 884), using maximum recorded IgE/EOS, 33% had high IgE/high EOS, 28% low IgE/low EOS and approximately a fifth each had high IgE/low EOS or low IgE/high EOS. Proportions were similar when EOS values measured 2 or 4 weeks before an exacerbation were excluded. Using EOS/IgE 'same day' measurements (N = 578) only identified half of the high EOS group. Patients in high IgE groups were more likely to be younger males without comorbid COPD; those in high EOS groups were more likely to be on BTS treatment Step 5 vs 4. The low IgE/low EOS group had the lowest incidence of asthma-related hospital attendances, the highest incidence was observed in the high EOS groups.
   Conclusion: Maximum available EOS measurement irrespective of exacerbations may be relevant when considering therapy. These data showed low IgE/Low EOS to be more benign and high EOS groups at increased risk of frequent, severe exacerbations.

AB Background: Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF) is the most frequent form of heart failure in ambulatory patients with new-onset symptoms. We previously showed that lung function abnormalities are highly prevalent in HFPEF patients. In this observational, longitudinal study, we tested the hypothesis that the presence of airflow limitation and/or arterial hypoxemia predicts mortality and/or cardiovascular hospitalizations during follow-up in HFPEF outpatients.
   Materials and methods: HFPEF was diagnosed following the international recommendations. Forced spirometry and arterial blood gases were measured at recruitment according to international recommendations. The primary endpoint of the study was all-cause mortality and the secondary one was any cardiovascular hospitalization.
   Results: We included in the analysis all consecutive outpatients newly diagnosed of HFPEF in our clinic between April 2009 and January 2013 (n = 71). Patients were prospectively followed up for a mean of 4 years (range 10 months to 5.8 years). All-cause mortality was 18.3%. It was higher in patients with airflow limitation (30%) than those with normal spirometry (10%) or other spirometric defects (19%) (p = 0.036). The presence of arterial hypoxemia did not predict mortality (p = 0.179) but was significantly related to cardiovascular hospitalizations during follow-up (p = 0.038).
   Conclusions: The presence of airflow limitation or arterial hypoxemia identify a group of patients with HFPEF at higher risk of death or cardiovascular hospitalizations, respectively. Given that both airflow limitation and arterial hypoxemia are treatable, we propose that lung function should be routinely evaluated in the outpatient management of HFPEF patients.

AB Background: There are no validated patient diaries for evaluating respiratory symptoms in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).
   Purpose: To evaluate the performance properties of the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) Evaluating Respiratory Symptoms (TM) (E-RS (TM): COPD) measure in patients with IPF.
   Methods: Concept elicitation and cognitive interviews were conducted with IPF patients to evaluate content validity, including comprehensiveness, relevance, and interpretability of E-RS (TM) items in this patient population. Secondary analyses of IPF clinical study data were performed to evaluate the scoring structure of the tool. With modifications, reliability, validity, and responsiveness of the instrument (E-RS (TM) : IPF) were evaluated.
   Results: Qualitative interviews (n = 30) were conducted. During the elicitation interviews (n = 20), concept saturation for IPF respiratory symptoms was achieved; all respiratory symptoms covered by the E-RS (TM) were endorsed by >= 30% of the sample. During cognitive interviews (n = 10), all participants found the items interpretable and relevant. Factor analyses conducted via secondary analysis of IPF clinical study data identified no total score and four symptom scales: Chest, Breathlessness, Cough, and Sputum. Reliability of each scale was high (internal consistency [alpha]> 0.85); 2-day reproducibility (ICC > 0.88). Validity was supported through significant (P < 0.0001) relationships with the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), the University of California, San Diego Shortness of Breath Questionnaire (UCSD-SOBQ), and other variables. The scales were responsive to change when evaluated using SGRQ Symptoms, UCSD-SOBQ, and Patient Global Impression of Change as anchors (P < 0.01 to P < 0.0001).
   Conclusion: The E-RS (TM) : IPF is a valid, reliable, and responsive tool for evaluating respiratory symptoms in patients with IPF.

ID MODEL
AB New 3D technologies are rapidly entering into the surgical landscape, including in interventional pulmonology. The transition of 2D restricted data into a physical model of pathological airways by three-dimensional printing (3DP) allows rapid prototyping and fabrication of complex and patient-specific shapes and can thus help the physician to plan and guide complex procedures. Furthermore, computer-assisted designed (CAD) patient-specific devices have already helped surgeons overcome several therapeutic impasses and are likely to rapidly cover a wider range of situations. We report herein with a special focus on our clinical experience: i) how additive manufacturing is progressively integrated into the management of complex central airways diseases; ii) the appealing future directions of these new technologies, including the potential of the emerging technique of bioprinting; iii) the main pitfalls that could delay its introduction into routine care.

TI Efficacy and safety of lebrikizumab in adult patients with
   mild-to-moderate asthma not receiving inhaled corticosteroids
SO RESPIRATORY MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
DE Mild; Moderate; Asthma; Lebrikizumab
ID DOUBLE-BLIND; UNCONTROLLED ASTHMA; PERSISTENT ASTHMA; ORAL MONTELUKAST;
   PLACEBO
AB Background: Asthma is a heterogeneous and complex disease in both its clinical course and response to treatment. IL-13 is central to Type 2 inflammation and contributes to many features of asthma. In a previous Phase 2 study, lebrikizumab, an anti-IL-13 monoclonal antibody, did not significantly improve FEV1 in mild-to-moderate asthma patients not receiving ICS therapy. This Phase 3 study was designed to further assess the efficacy and safety of lebrikizumab in adult patients with mild-to-moderate asthma treated with daily short-acting beta(2)-agonist therapy alone.
   Methods: Adult patients with mild-to-moderate asthma were randomised to receive lebrikizumab 125 mg subcutaneously (SC), placebo SC, or montelukast 10 mg orally for 12 weeks, with an 8-week follow-up period. The primary efficacy endpoint was absolute change in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 from baseline at Week 12.
   Findings: A total of 310 patients were randomised and dosed in the study. The mean absolute change in FEV1 from baseline at Week 12 was higher in the lebrikizumab-treated arm compared with placebo (150 mL versus 67 mL); however, this improvement did not achieve statistical significance (overall adjusted difference of 83 mL [95% CI: -3, 170]; p=.06). Montelukast did not improve FEV1 as compared with placebo. Lebrikizumab was generally safe and well tolerated during the study.
   Interpretation: Lebrikizumab did not significantly improve FEV1 in mild-to-moderate asthma patients at a dose expected to inhibit the IL-13 pathway. Inhibiting IL-13 in this patient population was not sufficient to improve lung function. These data support the findings of a previous trial of lebrikizumab in patients not receiving ICS.

AB Background: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), especially obstructive sleep apnea disorder (OSA), is thought to mainly affect men over the age of 40. Following findings that Asian people are more likely to experience severe OSA, regardless of obesity, we investigated the prevalence of SDB and OSA in a larger sample and in more younger age groups than those described in previous reports.
   Methods: Between 2011 and 2016, 487 medical students (358 males, mean age 24.8 +/- 1.9 years; 129 females: mean age 23.8 +/- 1.6 years) underwent an out-of-center sleep test using a type-3 portable monitor. The results were analyzed visually.
   Results: The mean +/- standard deviation of the respiratory event index (REI: events/hour of monitoring) was 5.4 +/- 6.7 (6.7 +/- 7.5 in male participants, 2.6 +/- 2.1 in female participants). There were 170 participants (36.6%) with an REI >= 5, including 158 male participants (46.9%) and 12 female participants (9.1%). SDB or undefined OSA with low REI (15 > REI >= 5) was observed in 141 participants (30.4%), defined OSA with moderate REI (30 > REI >= 15) in 19 participants (4.1%), and defined OSA with high REI (REI >= 30) in 10 participants (2.2%). Among the male students, 129 had low REI (38.3%), 19 had moderate REI (5.6%), and 10 had high REI (3.0%). All female participants with OSA events (9.4%) had a low REI.
   Conclusions: The prevalence of OSA in Japanese young adults, especially males under 30 years old, is similar or even higher than that in older age groups described previously. Thus, an aggressive sleep study for SDB might be necessary for the younger generation in the Asian population. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   HEPATITIS; APNEA; IRON; IMPAIRMENT; PREVALENCE; DISORDERS; MOVEMENTS
AB Background: Questionnaires indicate that patients with liver disease have disturbed sleep. However, polysomnographic studies to quantify sleep architecture and sleep disorders in this population are lacking. The current study compared polysomnographic findings of two groups of patients with clinically stable but severe end-stage pathology of the liver and heart.
   Methods: This was a prospective study of consecutive patients with end-stage liver disease or severe heart failure (HF).
   Measurements and results: Patients underwent full-night, attended polysomnography along with a number of laboratory tests. Polysomnograms were scored blindly. Compared to HF patients, patients with cirrhosis suffered from severe periodic limb movements during sleep (PLMS), with an index of 39/hour associated with excessive arousals. In patients with cirrhosis, serum iron and ferritin levels were either at the upper normal limit or elevated. There were significant correlations between severity of PLMS versus blood levels of bilirubin (r = 0.73, p = 0.004) and ammonia (r = 0.74, p = 0.017).
   Conclusions: This was the first polysomnographic study of patients with stable cirrhosis demonstrating severely disturbed sleep infrastructure and presence of excessive PLMS with arousals. The patho-biochemical mechanisms of these findings remain to be established. Independent of the mechanisms, these polysomnographic findings confirmed the subjective reports of poor sleep by patients with cirrhosis. Further, a subset of patients with cirrhosis acquired a syndrome similar to idiopathic Parkinson's disease, which per se was frequently associated with PLMS; the current results were consistent with this notion. Future studies are needed to determine if PLMS of cirrhosis is an early indication of incident Parkinsonian syndrome. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Brain iron deficiency has been implicated in the pathophysiology of RLS, and current RLS treatment guidelines recommend iron treatment when peripheral iron levels are low. In order to assess the evidence on the oral and intravenous (IV) iron treatment of RLS and periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD) in adults and children, the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group (IRLSSG) formed a task force to review these studies and provide evidence-based and consensus guidelines for the iron treatment of RLS in adults, and RLS and PLMD in children.
   Methods: A literature search was performed to identify papers appearing in MEDLINE from its inception to July 2016. The following inclusion criteria were used: human research on the treatment of RLS or periodic limb movements (PLM) with iron, sample size of at least five, and published in English. Two task force members independently evaluated each paper and classified the quality of evidence provided.
   Results: A total of 299 papers were identified, of these 31 papers met the inclusion criteria. Four studies in adults were given a Class I rating (one for IV iron sucrose, and three for IV ferric carboxymaltose); only Class IV studies have evaluated iron treatment in children. Ferric carboxymaltose (1000 mg) is effective for treating moderate to severe RLS in those with serum ferritin <300 mg/l and could be used as first-line treatment for RLS in adults. Oral iron (65 mg elemental iron) is possibly effective for treating RLS in those with serum ferritin similar to 75 mu g/l. There is insufficient evidence to make conclusions on the efficacy of oral iron or IV iron in children.
   Conclusions: Consensus recommendations based on clinical practice are presented, including when to use oral iron or IV iron, and recommendations on repeated iron treatments. New iron treatment algorithms, based on evidence and consensus opinion have been developed. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Objective: Periodic limb movements during sleep (PLMS) are prevalent in the general population, but their impact on sleep and association with cardiometabolic disorders are a matter of debate.
   Methods: Data from 2162 participants (51.2% women, mean age 58.4 +/- 11.1 years) of the population-based HypnoLaus study (Lausanne, Switzerland) were collected. Subjective sleep complaints and habits were assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). Participants underwent a full polysomnography (PSG) at home and were evaluated for the presence of hypertension, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome.
   Results: Participants with a PLMS index (PLMSI) > 15/h (28.6% of the sample) had longer subjective sleep latency (18.6 +/- 17.2 vs. 16.1 +/- 14.3 min, p = 0.014) and duration (7.1 +/- 1.2 vs. 6.9 +/- 1.1 h, p < 0.001) than participants with PLMSI <= 15/h. At the PSG, they spent more time in stage N2 sleep (49.0 +/- 11.2 vs. 45.5 +/- 9.8%, p < 0.001), less in stage N3 (17.6 +/- 8.2 vs. 20.6 +/- 8.4%, p < 0.001) and in REM sleep (20.3 +/- 6.4 vs. 22.4 +/- 6.0%, p < 0.001), and exhibited longer REM latency (104.2 +/- 70.2 vs. 91.7 +/- 58.6 min, p < 0.001) and higher arousal index (26.5 +/- 12.3 vs. 19.2 +/- 9.7 n/h, p < 0.001). Participants with a PLMSI > 15/h had a lower ESS scores and higher prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. Multivariate analysis adjusting for confounding factors confirmed the independent association of PLMSI > 15/h with subjective sleep latency and duration, and with objective sleep structure disturbances. However, the associations with sleepiness and cardiovascular risk factors disappeared.
   Conclusions: In our large middle-age European population-based sample, PLMSI > 15/h was associated with subjective and objective sleep disturbances but not with sleepiness, hypertension, diabetes, or metabolic syndrome. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID SCALE
AB Establishment of a consistent bedtime routine is often recommended to families with young children with sleep difficulties. However, there are limited studies assessing specific bedtime routines in the treatment of infant and toddler sleep disturbances. Thus, the purpose of this study was to examine the impact of a massage-based bedtime routine on infant sleep, maternal sleep, and maternal mood. A total of 123 mothers and their 3- to 18-month-old infant were randomly assigned to a routine (one-week baseline of usual bedtime routine, two-weeks intervention) or control group (three-weeks of their usual bedtime routine). All mothers completed the Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire (BISQ) on a weekly basis and measures of maternal sleep and mood (eg, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale). This bedtime routine resulted in improvements in child and mother night wakings, maternal perceptions of child sleep and mood (ie, sleep problem, bedtime ease, and morning mood), and improvements in maternal sleep quality. No comparative changes were seen in the control group. Notably, other than number of night wakings for both the child and the mother, there were no changes in other sleep patterns including sleep onset latency, duration of night wakings, longest stretch of sleep, or sleep duration. This study supports recommending a massage-based routine in those families, with the codicil that improvements in maternal perceptions and maternal sleep will be noted, with few improvements in sleep itself other than night wakings.

AB Background: Up to 50% of overweight/obese children have obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) compared to up to 6% of normal weight children. We compared cardiovascular variables between normal weight and overweight/obese children with and without OSA, and controls.
   Methods: Seventy-four referred children and 24 normal weight non-snoring controls (8-18 years) were recruited. Referred children were grouped according to their obstructive apnea hypopnea index (OAHI): OSA (>1 event/h) or primary snoring (PS <= 1 event/h) and whether they were normal weight (BMI z-score <1.04) or overweight/obese (BMI z-score >= 1.04). Wake blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), and pulse transit time (PTT, an inverse continuous surrogate measure of blood pressure) during sleep were recorded.
   Results: Wake BP was higher in the overweight/obese OSA group than in the control, normal weight PS, and overweight/obese PS groups (p < 0.05 for all). During sleep, BP, and HR were elevated in the overweight/obese OSA group compared to those in non-snoring controls (p < 0.05). More children who were overweight/obese had reduced BP and HR dipping from wake to sleep than normal weight children. The BMI z-score predicted HR and PTT when asleep and both age and BMI z-score predicted BP when awake.
   Conclusion: This study showed that BMI has both combined and independent effects on BP and HR in children with OSA. We have previously shown that treatment of OSA reduces BP and suggest that treatment of OSA in the growing number of overweight/obese children may improve cardiovascular outcomes.

AB Objective: The Japanese Sleep Questionnaire for Elementary Schoolers (JSQ-ES) was developed to measure the sleep habits and disturbances of Japanese children. The current study aimed to present psychometric properties and describe the score distribution of the JSQ-ES. In addition, it examined correlations between the sleep and daytime behavior of school-aged children.
   Method: Guardians of 4369 elementary school children and 100 children diagnosed with sleep disorders in two clinics completed the JSQ-ES.
   Results: Exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis suggested a nine-factor structure. The JSQ-ES internal consistency was 0.876 and 0.907 for the community and clinical groups, respectively. Score distribution differences were observed between the two groups. A cut-off point of 80 was identified for the total JSQ-ES score.
   Conclusions: Exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis suggested a nine-factor structure: (1) restless legs syndrome; (2) sleep-disordered breathing; (3) morning symptoms; (4) nighttime awakenings; (5) insomnia; (6) excessive daytime sleepiness; (7) daytime behavior; (8) sleep habits; and (9) irregular/delayed sleep phase. The study verified that the JSQ-ES is a valid and reliable instrument with which to evaluate Japanese sleep habits using a large population-based sample. The JSQ-ES may be useful in both clinical and academic settings. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: In older adults, both short and long sleep duration are associated with lower cognitive function, suggesting an inverted U-shaped association between sleep duration and cognitive outcomes. This study examined whether sleep duration is associated with (changes in) cognitive function in a middle-aged population.
   Methods: In the Doetinchem Cohort Study, the cognitive function of 2970 men and women aged 41-75 years at baseline (1995-2007) was examined 2-3 times, with 5-year time intervals. Global cognitive function and the domains memory, information processing speed, and cognitive flexibility were assessed. In multivariable linear regression models, (change in) self-reported sleep duration was studied in association with the level and change in cognitive function. In a subsample of the population (n = 2587), the association of sleep duration and feeling rested with cognitive function was studied.
   Results: Sleep duration of 9 h and more was statistically significantly associated with lower global cognitive function (p < 0.01), memory (p = 0.02), and flexibility (p = 0.03), compared to a sleep duration of 7 or 8 h. Among adults feeling frequently not well rested, both short and long sleep duration were associated with a lower speed of cognitive function. An inverted U-shaped association between sleep duration and cognitive function was observed for speed, flexibility, and global cognitive function. Sleep duration was not associated with change in cognitive function.
   Conclusions: Middle-age adults with long sleep duration had a lower cognitive function. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Background: Insomnia symptoms are highly prevalent among patients with psychiatric disorders, and this mandates the need to identify the best self-administered sleep measure to screen for clinical insomnia among them.
   Methods: A total of 400 psychiatric outpatients completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Flinders Fatigue Scale, Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire, and Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep Scale in a cross-sectional study. The sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive values of these six sleep scales were assessed and compared in relation to both ICD-10 and DSM-5 insomnia disorder status established using the interviewer-administered Brief Insomnia Questionnaire.
   Results: Receiver operator characteristic curves with the area under the curve (AUC) revealed the ISI to be the most accurate measure to discriminate cases and non-cases on both ICD-10 (AUC = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.84-0.92) and DSM-5 (AUC = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.78-0.86) criteria with "good" accuracy. The cut-off scores of >14 and >11 for the ISI provided optimal sensitivity and specificity for the detection of ICD-10 and DSM-5 insomnia, respectively.
   Discussion: With the new calling from DSM-5 to treat sleep symptoms in the presence of a co-existing mental condition, early detection of psychiatric patients with clinically significantly insomnia using a simple but accurate self-report sleep measure becomes important. Our study suggests that the ISI could be used as a potential screening tool for comorbid insomnia disorder in patients with mental disorders. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Nasal pillows (P) can be an alternative to the standard nasal masks (N), although there are no data about their long-term efficacy. This study aimed to assess long-term effectiveness and adherence to CPAP therapy delivered with nasal pillows in obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) patients.
   Methods: A retrospective observational design involving a series of consecutive CPAP-naive patients affected by OSAS. After an initial mask fitting session all patients were allowed to choose the type of nasal interface (N or P) they preferred. Outcomes were assessed 5 days after CPAP titration, and after 2 and 12 months. Patients were offered the option of switching to an alternative mask if needed.
   Results: Data from 144 patients were analyzed. Subjects were predominantly male (76%), middle aged (58.14 +/- 12.86), moderately obese (body mass index: 33.89 +/- 7.56), and affected by severe OSAS (apnea-hypopnea index: 47.60 +/- 21.31). A total of 102 patients (70.8%) chose P, and 42 (29.2%) chose N. Clinical and polygraphic features, and CPAP pressure levels were similar in P and N groups, both at baseline and at 12 months. A good adherence to treatment was observed in both groups (P, 5.5 +/- 1.8 h; N, 5.3 +/- 1.5 h). Seventy-six patients (53%) reported at least one side effect during the whole study period, without statistically significant between-group differences. Nostril pain was the most frequent side effect in P.
   Conclusions: Nasal pillows showed equal long-term effectiveness and objective adherence as standard nasal masks. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To compile an objective accurate description of the motor patterns of adult arousal disorders (ADs).
   Methods: We reviewed 59 nocturnal video-polysomnographic (VPSG) recordings of 30 adult patients (> 15 years) with a history of sleepwalking (SW). We scrutinized the semeiology of all 184 episodes recorded, classifying them into three groups according to three semeiological motor patterns characterized by increasing intensity and complexity: simple arousal movements (pattern I), characterized by head flexion/extension, head flexion/extension and limb movement or head flexion/extension and partial trunk flexion/extension; rising arousal movements (pattern II), characterized by a complete trunk flexion with patient sitting up in bed; and complex arousal with ambulatory movements (pattern III) characterized by SW. The VPSG recordings were compared to those of 10 healthy controls.
   Results: AD patients presented with 169 pattern I, 37 pattern II, and nine pattern III episodes. Pattern I developed into pattern II in 17 cases and into pattern II followed by pattern III in five patients. Pattern II developed into pattern III in four patients. Onset was abrupt in 55% of the episodes. Episodes lasted a mean (+/- standard deviation) of 33 +/- 35 s. Movements tended to halt temporarily during 72% of the episodes. We recorded 248 movements during sleep in the healthy controls, none of whom presented with AD patterns.
   Conclusion: We identified three specific motor patterns in AD patients not previously reported and not observed in healthy controls. Identification of these patterns could be important for diagnosis and serve as the basis for a new definition of AD in adults. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, we systematically studied the spectroscopic characteristics of Yb3+ doped germanate, phosphate, silicate, and tellurite glasses. The emission peak beyond 976 nm showed irregular shift from 1001 nm to 1023 nm when Yb3+ in different glass matrices. It was associated with the Stark splitting of F-2(7/2) and the emission intensities ratio between the transition from the lowest Stark splitting energy level of F-2(5/2) to the Stark splitting energy levels of F-2(7/2), e to b and that of e to d. Larger Stark splitting of F-2(7/2) results in the red-shift of the near infrared emission band at room temperature and larger ratio results in the blue-shift of emission band. The fluorescence lifetimes of Yb3+ doped germanate, phosphate, silicate, and tellurite glasses were measured to be 0.94, 0.82, 1.51, and 0.66 ms, respectively. The fluorescence lifetime was associated with the reabsorption of Yb3+, which larger absorption cross section at the emission band results in larger reabsorption, then leads to the shorter near infrared fluorescence lifetime.

AB In this paper, ytterbium doped strontium fluoride (Yb: SrF2) nanoparticles were synthesized by direct precipitation method. High-speed centrifugation was used to separate high sintering activity of nano powders from powders with hard aggregated and large size. Using powders at different parts of the centrifugal tube as starting powders, Yb: SrF2 transparent ceramics was fabricated by hot pressed (HP) method for the first time. Effects of morphology and particle size on the sinterability of Yb: SrF2 nanopowders were investigated. The transmittance reached 77% at the wavelength of 1200 nm and pores stilled remained in the ceramics. The spectroscopic and thermal properties of Yb: SrF2 transparent ceramics were also investigated. This paper provides an effective way to obtain well dispersed and high sinterability nanoparticles for SrF2 ceramics sintering. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Solid-state laser gain media based on the garnet structure with two spatially distinct but optically contiguous regions have been fabricated. Transparent gain media comprised of a central core of Y2.97Nd0.03Al5.00O12.00 (Nd:YAG) and an undoped cladding region of Y(3)AI(5)O(12) (YAG) were fabricated by direct ink write and transparent ceramic processing. Direct ink write (DIW) was employed to form the green body, offering a general route to preparing functionally structured solid-state laser gain media. Fully-dense transparent optical ceramics in a "top hat" geometry with YAG/Nd:YAG have been fabricated by DIW methods with optical scatter at 1064 nm of <3%/cm. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Nonlinear optical (NLO) polymer is a promising material for active waveguide devices that can provide large bandwidth and high-speed response time. However, the performance of the active devices is not only related to the waveguide materials, but also related to the waveguide and electrode structures. In this paper, a high-speed Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) type of electro-optic (EO) switch based on NLO polymer-clad waveguide was fabricated. The quasi-in-plane coplanar waveguide electrodes were also introduced to enhance the poling and modulating efficiency. The characteristic parameters of the waveguide and electrode were carefully designed and simulated. The switches were fabricated by the conventional micro-fabrication process. Under 1550-nm operating wavelength, a typical fabricated switch showed a low insertion loss of 10.2 dB, and the switching rise time and fall time were 55.58 and 57.98 ns, respectively. The proposed waveguide and electrode structures could be developed into other active EO devices and also used as the component in the polymer-based large-scale photonic integrated circuit.

AB The present article discusses the optical and structural properties of Tb and Dy co-doped Bi2SiO5 nanophosphors which were synthesized by Co-precipitation method. The synthesized sample contains plate-like morphology of uniform thickness similar to 200 nm. Prepared samples were found of average crystallite size similar to 20 nm, which yield bright yellow dominating white emission and green emission, in Dy: Bi2SiO5 and Tb: Bi2SiO5 nanophosphor, respectively under LW-light excitation. We have reported one-way efficient energy transfer from Dy to Tb ion, which facilitates precise colour tuning ability. The energy transfer phenomenon was well explored using, photoexcitation, photoluminescence and time-resolved luminescence techniques. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Nb/Yb co-doped RbTiOPO4 (RTP) crystals were successfully grown by a top-seeded solution growth method from two different kinds of flux systems. 5%Nb/3%Yb: RTP crystal with more transparency was obtained from the mixed solvent containing MoO3. The chemical composition was analyzed by Electron Probe Microanalyzer (EPMA), and the result indicated that co-doping of Nb and Yb into RTP can greatly increase the concentration of Yb in RTP crystal. The addition of MoO3 into self-flux system can improve the quality of as-grown crystals, but it is not helpful to introduce Yb into crystal. The electronic structures of Nb/Yb: RTP crystals were analyzed using X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS). The results show that the binding energy difference between O 1s and P 2p levels (Delta BE (O-P)) increases firstly with the increase of Yb content, and then decreases with Nb content increasing, which is associated with the covalency change of O-P bonds in crystals. However, the doping has little influence on the chemical bond properties of O-Ti. The FL spectra of Nb/Yb: RbTiOPO4 crystals were also analyzed, and five emission peaks characteristic of Yb3+ ions were observed. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Thin films of copper zinc tin sulfide (CZTS), a quaternary semiconductor, was deposited onto well cleaned soda lime glass substrates using binary sulfur based sputtering targets - copper sulfide (CuS), zinc sulfide (ZnS), and tin sulfide (SnS) by RF Magnetron Sputtering at 300 degrees C. The stacking order of ZnS/CuS/SnS was used to deposit CZTS thin films. The composition of CZTS thin films were confirmed using X Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and the atomic ratio of the individual elements were quantitatively estimated. X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies were used to understand the CZTS phase formation and the presence of CZTS kesterite phase along <112> direction was detected with the secondary phase of SnS and ZnS. XRD results were validated with Raman results were the presence of CZTS and SnS was corroborated. The optical properties of CZTS thin films were studied using UV Vis NIR spectrophotometer where the optical band gap was 1.46 eV and as well as other optical parameters such as interference and optical band gap were ascertained and the results are discussed.

AB Peacock tail feathers exhibit diverse striking brilliancy, as the cortex in different colored barbules of the feathers contains a 2-D photonic-crystal structure. The mechanochromic response of the 2-D photonic structure in peacock feather barbules is measured for the first time, by combining an in-situ stretching device and a reflectivity measurement system. The reflectance spectra of the barbule specimen blueshifts own to stretching along its longitudinal direction. A high strain sensitivity of 5.3 nm/% is obtained for green barbules. It could be of great help in bionic design of strain sensors using 2D photonic crystal structures. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB With the aim to enhance the upconversion luminescence (UCL) intensity, much attention was paid to reduce the energy-back transfer from Er3+ ions to Nd3+ ions by constructing various kinds of multilayer upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs). However, the energy-back transfer was difficult to be completely eliminated. Also, the thick shell of multilayer UCNPs is not favourable for effective Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) in photodynamic therapy (PDT) system. Herein, an effective and facile method was applied to prepare UCNPs by optimizing the composition to largely enhance the red emission (at 660 nm) for efficient generation of singlet oxygen (102). In detail, the concentrations of Nd3+ ions and Yb3+ ions doped in the sensitizing shell were systematically researched to balance the energy back transfer and the light harvest ability. The optimal emission and a relatively high Red/Green (RAG) ratio of NaYF4:Yb,Er,Nd@NaYF4:Yb0.1Nd0.2 UCNPswere obtained simultaneously. Furthermore, the emission under 980 nm excitation demonstrated the energy back-transfer from Er3+ to Yb3+ ions was also notable which was largely ignored previously. Then, UCNPs were encapsulated into mesoporous silica shell, and the photosensitizer Chlorin e6 (Ce6) was covalently conjugated to form a non-leaking nanoplatform. The efficiency of O-1(2) generation obviously increased with the enhanced emission of UCNPs. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB An optical spectroscopy analysis of TeO-GeO2-ZnO glass co-activating Sm3+/Tb3+ ions was carried out through Raman, photoluminescence spectra and decay time profiles as a function of Sm3+ concentration. According to the estimated CIE1931 chromaticity coordinates, the color of the emission can be adjusted from the yellow light region (0.4883, 0.4774), towards the reddish light region (0.5194,0.4144) by increasing the Sm3+ content from 1, 3, 5% mol, co-doped with 1% mol Tb3+ under co-excitation of Sm3+ and Tb3+ at 378 nm. The color temperatures are in the range of 1379-2804 K. Such photoluminescence is generated by the (4)G (5/2) -> H-4 (5/2), H-4 (7/2), H-4(9/2) emissions of Sm3+ in addition to the D-5(4) -> F-7(6,5,4,3) emissions of Tb3+; the single doped Sm3+ glass displayed an intense orange light. Meanwhile, co-doped Sm3+/Tb3+ glasses excited at 378 nm showed a significant reduction in Tb3+ emission, with a simultaneous increment in the reddish-orange emission of Sm3+, due to a non-radiative resonant energy transfer from Tb3+ to Sm3+. Decay time profile analysis of the Tb3+ emission as function of Sm3+ ion content suggests that an electric dipole dipole interaction into Tb3+ Sm3+ clusters might dominate in the energy transfer process, with an efficiency and probability of 0.22, 0.27, 038 and 122.8, 327.6, 522.7, respectively.

AB Studying the impact of radiations on doped silica glasses is essential for several technological applications. Herein, bulk silica glasses, activated with various concentrations of luminescent monovalent copper (Cu+), have been prepared using the sol-gel technique. Thereafter, these glasses were subjected to X- or gamma-rays irradiation at 1 MGy(SiO2) accumulated dose. The effect of these ionizing radiations on the optical properties of these glasses, as a function of the Cu-doping content, were investigated using optical absorption and photoluminescence spectroscopies. Before any irradiation, the glass with the lowest copper concentration exhibits blue and green luminescence bands under UV excitation, suggesting that Cu+ ions occupy both cubic and tetragonal symmetry sites. However, at higher Cu-doping level, only the green emission band exists. Moreover, we showed that the hydroxyl content decreases with increasing copper doping concentration. Both X and gamma radiation exposures induced visible absorption due to HC1 color centers in the highly Cu-doped glasses. In the case of the lower Cu-doped glass, the Cu+ sites with a cubic symmetry are transformed into sites with tetragonal symmetry. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The crystal structure of the films was characterized by X-ray diffractometer. The results show that the correlation coefficient between the refractive index and the grain size is more than 90%.

AB Glasses of the TeO2-WO3-Yb2O3 system are synthesized for wide range of Yb3+ concentrations of up to 6.0 x 10(21) ions/cm(3). The spectral-luminescent properties of lightly doped samples are investigated at room temperature and at the boiling point of liquid nitrogen. The energies of the Stark levels of the ground and excited states of Yb3+ ions incorporated into tungsten tellurite glass are determined by analyzing the low-temperature spectra. The absorption, emission, and gain cross section spectra are obtained. The excess of the measured fluorescence decay time over the radiative lifetime similar to 0.3 ms derived from the absorption spectra is attributed to the reabsorption effect in bulk samples. Measurements of lightly doped glass powder in the immersion liquid are made to reduce the effect of reabsorption. The fluorescence decay time of the powder is very close to the calculated radiative lifetime. Compared with phosphate, silicate, and other Yb3+-doped glasses, the tungsten tellurite glass has a promising potential as a gain medium for lasers and amplifiers. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

DE Porous silicon; Photonic crystals; Lattice dynamic effect; Limit in
   optical properties
AB Finite differential time domain (FDTD) tools were applied to simulate the optical properties characteristics' through square and triangular lattices of porous silicon (pSi) photonic crystals (PhCs); which consisted of periodical patterns of circular air holes built into the pSi material. This was used to investigate the influence of porosity and lattice dynamic on the reflection, transmission and absorption characteristics through unit cell pSi PhC in the visible wavelength domain (400 nm 700 nm). The numerical simulation was achieved using FDTD Lumerical solutions with periodic boundary conditions (PBC) and perfectly matched layers (PML) as the appropriate boundary conditions. The results revealed that the limitation of optical properties is dependent on porosity and the lattice dynamic in pSi PhC. This was presented by the trend; the higher the reflection the higher the porosity and a decrease in porosity led to an increase in absorption in both lattice considerations. It was discovered that attaining optimum properties for triangular lattice will entail considering porosities less than 50% and hole radius r to the lattice constant a ratio (r/a) above 0.3 for the absorption characteristic and below 0.3 for the transmission characteristic. Triangular lattice can be adapted to improve the optical pattern through the PhC. In addition, the optimisation of these properties through pSi PhCs was achieved by controlling porosity and the ratio r/a. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A new reverse microemulsion system is proposed for the first time to synthesize NaYF4:Yb,Er nano crystals, which demonstrated high upconversion emission in 550 and 662 nm at 980 nm diode laser excitation. The reverse microemulsion (mu Es) system is comprised of CTAB and oleic acid as surfactant and 1-butanol co-surfactant and isooctane oil phase. The surfactant to water ratio is able to tune the microemulsion droplet size from 14 to 220 nm, which eventually controls the crystallinity and particulate morphology of NaYF4:Yb,Er. Also, the microemulsion precursor and calcination temperature plays certain role in transforming the cubic NaYF4:Yb,Er to highly luminescent hexagonal crystal structured upconversion material. Single phase hexagonal NaYF4:YbEr nanorod prepared by water-in-oil reverse microemulsion (mu Es) gives intense red upconversion emission. Both nanosphere and nanorod shaped NaYF4:Yb,Er was obtained, but nanorod morphology resulted an enhanced upconversion luminescence. The structural, morphological, thermal and optical luminescence properties of the NaYF4:Yb,Er nano particles are discussed in detail by employing powder X-ray diffraction, dynamic light scattering, high resolution electron microscopy, TGA-DTA, UV-DRS, FFIR and photoluminescence spectroscopy. Intense upconversion emission achieved in the microemulsion synthesized NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ nanocrystal can make it as useful optical phosphor for solar cell applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this work, we have investigated the effect of electric field and impurity position on nonlinear optical rectification of a double cone like quantum dot in the effective mass approximation and by using compact density-matrix formalism. We have calculated the energy levels and wave functions using finite element method (FEM) in the presence of impurity and influence of electric field. The results show that: (i) the binding energy changes with the impurity position and it is changed by the applied electric field, (ii) nonlinear optical rectification peak position of this system present the blue or red shift due to the applied electric field and changing the impurity position. (iii) for low electric field, impurity position plays an important role in electronic and optical properties, but for larger electric field, impurity position role becomes non-significant. (iv) the optical rectification changes due to the impurity position and the electric field are considerable. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The cylindrical structure, its diameter and alignment layers influence the orientations of cubic BP domains and affect their growth. A homogeneous BP structure was obtained in a cylindrical tube by changing the temperature and by using external electric field.

AB This paper investigates the electrical properties of electron reflector layer to survey materials as an electron reflector (ER) for chalcopyrite CuInGaSe solar cells. The purpose is optimizing the conduction band and valence-band offsets at ER layer/CIGS junction that can effectively reduce the electron recombination near the back contact. In this work, an initial device model based on an experimental solar cell is established, then the properties of a solar cell with electron reflector layer are physically analyzed. The electron reflector layer numerically applied to baseline model of thin-film CIGS cell fabricated by ZSW (efficiency = 203%). The improvement of efficiency is achievable by electron reflector layer materials with Eg > 1.3 eV and -0.3 < Delta chi < 0.7, depends on bandgap. Our simulations examine various electron reflector layer materials and conclude the most suitable electron reflector layer for this real CIGS solar cells. ZnSnP2, CdSiAS(2), GaAs, CdTe, Cu2ZnSnS4, InP, CuO, Pb10Ag3Sb11S28, Culn(5)S(8), SnS, PbCuSbS3, Cu3AsS4 as well as CuIn1-xGaxSe (x > 0.5) are efficient electron reflector layer materials, so the potential improvement in efficiency obtained relative gain of 5%.

AB Blue light converted light-emitting diodes is of great significance as a candidate for next generation lighting. In this work, the WO3:Eu3+ inverse opal photonic crystals were prepared and their luminescence properties were studied. The results demonstrated that the main excitation peak of WO3:Eu3+ inverse opals were located at 465 nm. The red luminescence peak at the 613 nm was observed in the WO3:Eu3+ inverse opal upon 465 nm excitation, exhibiting better red color purity. The influence of photonic band gap on the photoluminescence of WO3:Eu3+ inverse opal was obtained. When the red luminescence peak is in the regions of the photonic band gap and the edge of the band-gap, the red luminescence suppression and enhancement was observed respectively. The WO3:Eu3+ inverse opals may be a promising candidate for the blue light converted LEDs. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Liquid crystal (LC) alignment on inorganic films has been found to be affected by surface modification via ion-beam irradiation. In this study, ZnO films treated by rubbing with a velvet cloth were shown to be capable of aligning LC molecules in the direction of the rubbing. Uniform and homogeneous LC alignment was achieved on the rubbed ZnO films. By analysing the optical axes before and after the rubbing treatment, we confirmed an increase in the anisotropy of the ZnO films; this optical anisotropy contributed to the uniform orientation of LC molecules. Further, the electro-optical characteristics of the twisted nematic cells based on ZnO films were superior to those based on conventional polyimide layers. Our results indicate that the rubbing approach could be applied in the fabrication of high-performance LC displays. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We report the fabrication and characterization of double line waveguides directly written in tellurite and germanate glasses using a femtosecond laser delivering 30 mu J, 80 fs pulses at 4 kHz repetition rate. The double line waveguides produced presented internal losses inferior to 2.0 dB/cm. The output mode profile and the M-2 measurements indicate multimodal guiding behavior. A better beam quality for the GeO2 - Pbo waveguide was observed when compared with TeO2 - ZnO glass. Raman spectroscopy of the waveguides showed structural modification of the glassy network and indicates that a negative refractive index modification occurs at the focus of the laser beam, therefore allowing for light guiding in between two closely spaced laser written lines. The refractive index change at 632 nm is around 10(-4), and the structural changes in the laser focal region of the writing, evaluated by Raman spectroscopy, corroborated our findings that these materials are potential candidates for optical waveguides and passive components. To the best of our knowledge, the two double line configuration demonstrated in the present work was not reported before for germanate or tellurite glasses. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB The Dy3+/Yb3+ co-doped germanate glasses with good thermal stability have been prepared by the conventional melt quenching method. The J-O intensity parameters and radiative properties such as spontaneous transition probilities (A(rad)), fluorescence branching ratios (beta) and radiative lifetimes (tau(rad)) were investigated according to the absorption spectrum based on Judd-Ofelt theory. An intense emission ;around similar to 3 mu m with the FWHM reaching to 322 nm was obtained in present glasses excited by 980 nm LD. The high spontaneous transition probability (63.94 s(-1)), large emission cross section (6.0 x 10(-21) cm(2)) and superior gain performance corresponding to the Dy3+: 6H(13/2) -> 6H(15/2) transition were obtained. Moreover, the energy transfer mechanism was analyzed qualitatively, and it was found that the energy transfer from Yb3+ : F-2(5/2) to Dy3+: H-6(5/2) level could be quite efficient. Hence, the results indicated that the prepared Dy3+/Yb3+ co-doped germanate glass could be a potential candidate for similar to 3 mu m mid-infrared solid state lasers. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

It could be found that the variation of the absorption coefficient is approximately from 8.95 cm(-1) to 26.02 cm(-1) in the frequency range of 0.2 THz to 1 THz, and the tuning range is about 3.32 cm(-1) at 0.6 THz which almost reaches up to nearly 23.32%. The micromechanism of these results was attributed to the excited free carriers by the external optical pump intensity. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The organometallic crystal of Dichlorobis(DL-valine)zinc(II) was grown by solution growth method. The computed structural geometry, vibrational wavenumbers and UV visible spectra were compared with experimental results. Hirshfeld surface map was used to locate electron density and the fingerprint plots percentages are responsible for the stabilization of intermolecular interactions in molecular crystal. The second-order hyperpolarizability value of the molecule was also calculated at density functional theory method. The surface resistance and third-order nonlinear optical property of the crystal were studied by laser induced surface damage threshold and Z-scan techniques, respectively using Nd:YAG laser with wavelength 532 nm. The open aperture result exhibits the reverse saturation absorption, which indicate that this material has potential candidate for optical limiting and optoelectronic applications.

AB In this work, we employ various experimental techniques to illustrate the effects of nanostructuring on improvement of the luminescence properties of the polycrystalline SrS co-activated by cerium and samarium dopants (SrS:Ce,Sm). The nano and microstructure SrS:Ce,Sm powders were synthesized by the co-precipitation and solid state diffusion methods, respectively, followed by the spark plasma sintering (SPS) process to density powders into pellet shape. It is observed that the photo-luminescence (PL), radio-luminescence (RL), and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) emission intensity of the nano structure samples are significantly improved with respect to the microstructure samples. Moreover, by using an accurate photomultiplier tube, we measured the CW-OSL decay curves of the samples to demonstrate much higher and faster sensitivity of the nanostructure SrS:Ce,Sm for in-flight and online OSL radiation dosimetry. The obtained absorption and emission spectra are used for phenomenology of the electronic band structure of the SrS:Ce,Sm micro and nano-phosphors inside the band gap. The proposed phenomenological electronic structures are then used to clarify the role of Ce3+ and Sm3+ localized energy levels in the luminescence properties of the nano and microstructure samples. It is argued that electronic transitions from the T-2(2g), state of Ce3+ and the (4)G(5/2) state of Sm3+ have strong contribution to the PL and RL emission spectra, while in the OSL mechanism, the Sm3+ (4)G(5/2) state is mainly responsible for electrons trapping.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy are techniques used to characterize the crystal structure and compositional purity of stannite Cu2FeSnS4 nanoparticles. The detailed analysis of the experimental spectra has allowed us to determine the frequency and symmetry assignment of the main and weaker peaks. The milling time influence on synthesis stannite Cu2FeSnS4 from elemental precursors Cu, Fe, Sn and S is observed. Among the peaks that are characteristic for the stannite Cu2FeSnS4, we registered the modes of binary phases of FeS and SnS. The total disappearance of the binary phases of FeS and SnS is observed when the milling time is longer than 90 min. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Three dimensional chiral metamaterials, have unique helical shaped morphologies and periodically varying permittivity, possess inherent fascinatingly chiroptical activity in developing potential photonic applications. Herein, we demonstrate a systemic simulations of optical activity in chiral sculptured thin films (CSTFs) made of ZrO2. In particular, a circular dichroism (CD) and linear dichroism (LD) are scrutinized for the proposed ZrO2 CSTFs. From the calculated differential absorption, LD and CD spectrum is computed using linear and circular polarized light beams respectively. The signated mode of different peaks for LD and CD is observed at different sweep angles with a large LD effect. Moreover, the CD diminishes at large sweep angle. This finding strongly indicates high potential of our proposed helical ZrO2 nanostructures as a perfect polarization converter. Simultaneously, optical remittance of different helical nanostructures are also compared. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Using the combination of atomic-force microscopy (AFM), SHG confocal microscopy (SHGCM) and selective chemical etching we investigated domain patterns written on the non-polar surfaces of LiNbO3 crystals by electron-beam of SEM. The SHG intensity along the domain axis I-2 omega(z) is nonmonotonic and discontinuous. It has been shown experimentally that in agreement with the approach proposed recently, the coordinate dependences Iao(z) are related to variations of the domain thickness T-d. Assuming the wedge-like shape of domains, supported by the chemical etching data, a general expression for I-2 omega(z) is proposed taking into account both the domain depth Td in the irradiation point and the domain length L-d along the polar axis. This permits to calculate the period of I-2 omega(z) oscillations for different irradiation conditions, since T-d and L-d are determined by the accelerating voltage U of SEM and irradiation time t(p), respectively.

AB Luminescence characteristics of Ce3+ - doped Gd3GaxAl5-xO12 single crystals with different Ga contents (x = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) are studied in the 9-500 K temperature range. The spectra of the afterglow, photoluminescence, radioluminescence, and thermally stimulated luminescence (TSL) of each crystal coincide. The increase of the Ga content results in the high-energy shift of the spectra while the radioluminescence intensity at 9 K remains practically constant up to x = 4. No Ce3+ emission is observed in case of x = 5. The total TSL intensity drastically increases, reaches the maximum value around x = 2-3, and then decreases due to the thermal quenching of the Ce3+ emission. The TSL glow curve maxima are gradually shifting to lower temperatures, and the dependence of the maxima positions and the corresponding trap depths on the Ga content is close to linear. However, the activation energy of the TSL peaks creation under irradiation of the crystals in the 4f - 5d(1) absorption band of Ce3+ decreases drastically with the increasing Ga content (especially in the range of x = 1-2), and this dependence is found to be strongly nonlinear. Possible reasons of the nonlinearity are discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Eu3+-doped Sr2CaMoO6 phosphors have a broad excitation band at around 350-425 nm, which meets the demand of Near-ultraviolet (NUV, 365-410 nm) absorption when applied in NUV-excitable phosphor-converted white light emitting diodes (WLEDs). The luminescence thermal quenching effects of Eu3+ ions at A/B sites (612 nm/593 nm) in Sr2CaMoO6 might be distinct with resultant emission colour variation, which is less studied but of significance for a scientific perspective. This research investigates on the temperature-dependent luminescence and decay curves of the nominal Sr1.9Li0.05Eu0.05CaMoO6 and Sr2Ca0.9Li0.05Eu0.05MoO6 phosphors. Results indicate that the luminescence of B-site Eu3+ ions is quenched more easily than that of A-site Eu3+ ions, directly evidenced by the fast and slow decay components in the decay curves. A distortion of B-site octahedron with elevating temperature and strong coupling with phonons may be partially responsible for the relatively poor thermal quenching behaviors of B-site Eu3+ ions. The research gives perspective on the thermal quenching of emissive lanthanide ions at different sites in phosphors. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The Ho3+-doped ZrO2 ceramics exhibited varying fluorescence color tones depending on the excitation wavelength used. The different color tones match the fluorescence spectrum characteristics at each excitation wavelength. Our results demonstrate that Ho-3+-doped ZrO2 ceramics can discriminate between UV light, specifically the third, fourth, and fifth harmonics of a Nd:YAG laser.

These nanoparticles have an average size of 25 nm and 23 nm when the target is ablated for 20 and 30 min, respectively. The synthesized silicon nanoparticles are crystalline in nature and have cubic structure with 3.0 A interplanar distance. The effects of laser ablation time on the yield of synthesized nanoparticles in the solution are investigated and it is observed that the optimum ablation time of 20 min is required for the efficient synthesis of silicon nanoparticles while operating at an input pulse energy of 90 mJ.

AB Nd3+-doped lanthanum lead boro-tellurite glass samples were prepared by conventional melt quenching method and their structural, thermal, fluorescence, and decay times of the glasses were investigated. Prepared glass samples exhibits amorphous nature and shows good thermal stability in the temperature range of 100-800 degrees C. Judd-Ofelt (JO) analysis was carried out and the intensity parameters (Omega(lambda = 2, 4, 6)) also spontaneous radiative probability and stimulated-.emission cross-sections were estimated. The magnitude of Omega(lambda) confirms the covalency nature. The near infrared emission spectra were measured by 808 nm excitation in which the emission intensity is found to be high at 1060 nm for the F-4(3/2) -> F-4(11/2) transition. The stimulated cross section, effective band width and branching ratios are found to be 8.910 x 10(-20) cm(2), 21.57 nm and 53.72 % respectively, for F-4(3/2) -> F-4(11/2) transition. The derived gain bandwidth, figure of merit, threshold and saturation intensity found to be comparable to some of the glass systems. Furthermore, the time decay rate found to decrease from 100 its to 27 mu s when the concentration increased from 0.1 to 3.0 mol% of Nd3+ ions and also all follow the single exponential behaviour which is attributed to the self quenching effect due to the cross-relaxation channels.

AB In the current study, Era(3+)-doped fluorotellurite glasses modified by GaF3 have been developed. High thermal stability and relatively low phonon energy are confirmed by differential thermal analysis and Raman spectroscopy, respectively. Upon 980 nm excitation, intense luminescence emission around 2.71 mu m from the Er-(3+):I-4(11/2) -> I-4(13/2) transition is observed in the glass. Based on the Judd-Ofelt theory, intensity parameters and radiative properties are determined from the absorption and emission spectra. The proposed glass possesses high thermal stability (T-g of similar to 360 degrees C) and a large stimulated emission cross section, sigma(em), at 2.71 mu m (1.617 x 10(-20) cm(2)). The results indicate that it can be potentially applied in high-power mid-infrared fiber lasers. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study investigated both numerically and experimentally one-dimensional photonic crystals with periodic structures composed of Ge and ZnS. Numerical simulations indicated that the refractive index, physical thickness, reference wavelength, and periodicity have a great effect on the position and width of the photonic band gap. We fabricated three different thicknesses of structures within the range of 3 -5 mu m, with average reflectance values of 89.1%, 94.9%, and 87.9%; the corresponding emissivity values were 0.096, 0.079, and 0.143, respectively. The results indicated that the high reflectance or transmittance at any required wave band could be achieved by selecting suitable materials and structures. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Rigid pyrazino-phenanthroline based donor-pi-acceptor-pi-auxiliary acceptor type compounds have been studied for their linear and non-linear optical properties. The non-linear optical (NLO) behavior of these dyes was studied by calculating the values of static alpha, beta and gamma using solvatochromic as well as computational methods. The results obtained by solvatochromic method are correlated theoretically with Density Functional Theory (DFT) using B3LYP/6-31G (d), CAM B3LYP/6-31 G(d), B3LYP/6-31++ g(d,P) and CAM B3LYP/6-31++ g(d,P) methods. The results reveal that, among all four computational methods CAM-B3LYP/6-31++ g(d,P) performs well for the calculation of linear polarizability (alpha) and first order hyperpolarizability (beta), while CAM-B3LYP/6-31 g(d,P) for the calculation of second order hyperpolarizability (gamma). Overall TPA depends on the molecular structure variation with increase in complexity and molecular weight, which implies that both the number of branches and the size of pi-framework are important factors for the molecular TPA in this chromophoric system. Generalized Mulliken-Hush (GMH) analysis is performed to study the effective charge transfer from donor to acceptor. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Zinc oxide (ZnO) hybridized with graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) composite was prepared via one step calcination method and well characterized using various physiochemical techniques. The prepared composite exhibits excellent photocatalytic activity and stability for decolorization of methylene blue (MB) dye solution under visible light irradiation. Effect of various rate determining parameters such as catalyst loading, initial dye concentration and pH on the decolorization of MB has been analyzed. The optimum conditions for efficient color removal were found to be 7, 10 ppm and 2 g/L for pH, dye concentration and catalyst dosage respectively. The intermediate compounds formed during the decolorization process were evaluated by GCMS spectra. It was inferred that the ZnO/g-C3N4 (98.83%) composite exhibits highest decolorization efficiency as compare with pure g-C3N4 (35.21%). Such enhancement of photocataytic activity is mainly attributed to the efficient separation of photo induced electron hole pairs via Z-scheme model composed of ZnO and g-C3N4. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Ce3+ or Yb3+ singly doped LaBO3 and Ce3+-Yb3+ co-doped LaBO3 were prepared by conventional solid state reactions at 1100 degrees C and their photoluminescence (PL) properties were investigated. The emission spectrum of LaBO3:Ce3+,Yb3+ contains both the Ce3+ ultraviolet (UV) emissions (355 nm and 380 nm) and the Yb3+ near infrared (NIR) emission (975 nm) when excited by the UV light at 270 nm. By using the data of the Ce3+ decay curves and the PL intensities of both Ce3+ and Yb3+, the energy transfer efficiency (n) from Ce3+ to Yb3+, the actual energy transfer efficiency (At) and the quantum efficiency (Q) of the Yb3+ emission were calculated. In the Ce3+ Yb3+ co-doped LaBO3, Ce3+ can transfer its absorbed energy to Yb3+ efficiently (n can be over 60%), and Yb3+ shows the Q value over 50% when it accepts the energy from Ce3+, which results in the low AE value 30%. The energy transfer process from Ce3+ to Yb3+ may be understood by the charge transfer mechanism: Ce3+ + Yb3+ Ce4+ + Yb2+. Particularly the Ce3+ Yb3+ co-doped LaBO3 phosphor gives the emissions mainly in the UV range and the NIR range with a portion of visible emissions in eye-insensitive range. This unique property may be suitable for applications in anti-counterfeiting techniques and public security affairs. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper reports the luminescence properties of nanosized SrAl2O4:Eu2+ (1%) phosphors. The samples were prepared by combustion method at 600 degrees C, followed by annealing of the resultant combustion ash at 1000 degrees C in a reductive (Ar + H-2) atmosphere. X-ray diffraction (XRD), photo luminescence (PL) and cathodoluminescence (CL) analysis and thermal stimulated luminescence (TSL) method were applied to characterize the phosphor. For the first time a peak at 375 nm was observed in CL spectra of SrA1204:Eu2+ (1%) nanophosphors. Luminescence excitation spectra analysis have shown that this peak is related to crystal defects. Also in TSL curve one strong peak was observed in the region above room temperature (T = 325 K), which is attributed to lattice defects, namely oxygen vacancies. A green LED was fabricated by the combination of the SrAl2O4:Eu2+ (1%) nanosized phosphor and a 365 nm UV InGaN chip. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The new lanthanide coordination compounds of general formula [LnL(3)Q], where Ln = Eu, Gd, Tb; L = dimethyl-N-trichloroacetylamidophosphate and Q = 2-(1,3,4-oxadiazole-2-yl)pyridine, have been synthesized and isolated in crystalline state with the purpose of finding new interesting optical materials. X-ray data reveal that complexes have molecular structure with numerous Van-der-Vaals contacts between molecules. All the ligands are coordinated in bidentate chelate manner, coordination polyhedron was interpreted as distored square antiprism (CN 8). The obtained complexes were investigated by means of IR, absorption and luminescence spectroscopy as well and thermal gravimetric analysis. It was found that complex [TbL(3)Q] is resistant to temperature of 200 degrees C. The Eu3+ and Tb3+ complexes exhibit bright metal-centered emission with decay time 1.65 and 1.74 ms respectively. Intrinsic quantum yield for [EuL(3)Q] equals 85% that is one of the highest values, known to date for CAPh based europium complexes. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Mn2+/Yb3+ co-doped oxyfluoride glasses were facilely synthesized in the SiO2 Al2O3 Na2O CaF2 system. Partial crystallization processed during the preparation of the glasses, by which small amounts of CaF2 nano-crystals were formed. Under ultraviolet and blue (370-500 nm) light excitation, an efficient down-conversion involving the emission of near-infrared is realized in the Mn2+/Yb3+ co-doped oxyfluoride glasses. The near-infrared emission peaks mainly at 976 nm and secondarily at 1020 nm, which is a comfortable match with the band gap of c-Si. The variation in visible and near-infrared spectra and the decay curves of Mn2+:T-4(1) -> (6)A(1) emission have been investigated to verify the possible energy transfer from Mn2+ ions to Yb3+ ions. On analyzing the energy transfer processes theoretically and experimentally, we propose that quantum cutting and down-shifting processes may occur simultaneously in the samples. We suggest that the Mn2+-Yb3+ co-doped materials can provide a novel direction to realize UV Vis to NIR down-conversion for Si solar cells. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, kesterite films have been prepared by sulfurization of co-electrodeposited Cu-Zn-Sn (CZT) precursor using Na2SO4 as a complexing agent. The structural, morphological, optical and electrical properties of the films have been investigated in details. Adherent layers and pure kesterite phase were obtained. XRD analysis revealed the formation of a tetragonal crystal structure CZTS phase with majors and intense peaks (112), (200), (220), (312) plans. Raman analysis, using different wavelengths laser, confirmed the presence of a pure kesterite phase with minor trace of secondary phases in depth layer. SEM analyses show uniform and compact surface morphology with well definite boundary submicron particles. The absorption coefficient is higher than 1 x 10(4) cm(-1) in the visible region. Electrical measurements, performed in the temperature range of 300 K-100 K, confirmed the p-type conductivity with high free carrier concentrations. For temperatures higher than 200 K, the conductivity is ensured by the emission of free carriers above the potential barriers at the grain boundaries with activation energy close to 51 meV. For temperatures between 200 and 160 K, conduction is provided by nearest neighboring jumps (NNH) mechanism. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Polymer solar cells were fabricated with solution-processed transition metal oxides, MoO3 and V2O5 as anode buffer layers (ABLs). The optimized device with V2O5 ABL exhibited considerably higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) compared to the devices based on MoO3 and poly(3,4ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) ABLs. The space charge limited current measurements and impedance spectroscopy results of hole-only devices revealed that V2O5 provided a very low charge transfer resistance and high hole mobility, facilitating efficient hole transfer from the active layer to the ITO anode. More importantly, incorporation of V2O5 as ABL resulted in substantial improvement in device stability compared to MoO3 and PEDOT:PSS based devices. Unencapsulated PEDOT:PSS-based devices stored at a relative humidity of 45% have shown complete failure within 96 h. Whereas, MoO3 and V2O5 based devices stored in similar conditions retained 22% and 80% of their initial PCEs after 96 h. Significantly higher stability of the V2O5-based device is ascribed to the reduction in degradation of the anode/active layer interface, as evident from the electrical measurements.

AB We have developed an assistant dopant system in phosphorescent OLEDs. The system is consisted of a conventional host material 4,4'-Bis(carbazol-9-yl)biphenyl (CBP), a thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) 2,4,5,6-tetrakis(carbazol-9-yl)-1,3-dicyanobenzene (4CzIPN) and a red phosphor Bis[2-(4-n-hexylphenyl)quinoline](acetylacetonate)iridium(III) (Hex-Ir(phq)(2)(acac)), it has achieved maximum current efficiency and external quantum efficiency of 21.52 cd/A and 9.22%, respectively. The intrinsic mechanism and energy transfer process in the system have been discussed in detail. Moreover, a satisfactory critical current density Jo of 106.1 mA/cm(2) has been obtained when the assistant dopant concentration ascends to a suitable level, which indicated low efficiency roll-off of the device. By investigating the exciton generation mechanism and the transient electroluminescence (EL), the main cause of the improvement has been revealed. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The high-purity Ge-26-As17Se25Te32 glass sample was prepared by chemical distillation purification method. This glass is characterized by high value of glass transition temperature (263 degrees C), high optical transparency in the spectral range of 2-10 mu m, and low content of residual impurities. The Ge(26)AS(17)Se(25)Te(32) glass rods were drawn into single-index fibers using the "rod" method and the single crucible technique. The optical losses in the 400 mu m diameter fiber, fabricated by the "rod" method, were within 0.3-1 dB/m in the spectral range 5.2-9.3 gm. The minimum optical losses in the 320 mu m diameter fiber, fabricated by the "crucible" technique, were 1.6-1.7 dB/m in the spectral range 6-8.5 mu m. Using these Ge26As77Se25Te32 glass fibers as a sensor, the aqueous solutions of acetone (0-20 mol.%) and ethanol (0-90 mol.%) were analyzed by fiber evanescent wave spectroscopy. Peculiarities in the change of the integrated intensity and spectral position of absorption bands of these organic substances in dependence on the analyte composition and the length of the sensitive zone were established.

AB This paper presents the design, fabrication and investigation of a quadruple-resonant terahertz meta material that comprises two different Electric-inductance capacitance (ELC) resonators in a vertical configuration. Owing to asymmetric electric field coupling between the two resonators, the combined structure exhibits better performance in terms of transmission minima and bandwidths than the individual particles. The distributions of the surface current and electric field reveal quasi-quadrupole resonance, electric dipolar resonance and coupling between these resonances at different resonant frequencies. Moreover, the resonant frequencies are tunable by adjusting the corresponding geometrical parameters. Above all, the excellent performance of the proposed structure makes it promising for application in multiband terahertz devices. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We report on studies from an experimental and theoretical viewpoint of the electronic structure of mercury digallium selenide, HgGa2Se4, a very promising optoelectronic material. In particular, the method of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to evaluate binding energies of the constituent element core electrons and the shape of the valence band for pristine and Ar+-ion bombarded surfaces of HgGa2Se4 single crystal. First principles band-structure calculations were performed in the present work using the augmented plane wave + local orbitals (APW+lo). These calculations indicate that the Se 4p states are the main contributors at the top and in the upper portion of the valence band with slightly smaller contributions of the Ga 4p states in the upper portion of the band as well. Further, the central portion of the valence band is determined mainly by contributions of the Ga 4s states, and the Hg 5d states are the principal contributors to the bottom of the valence band. These theoretical data are in fair agreement when matching on a common energy scale of the X-ray emission bands giving information on the energy distribution of the Se 4p and Ga 4p states and the XPS valence-band spectrum of the HgGa2Se4 crystal. The principal optical constants are elucidated from the OFT calculations. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, the synthesis and the characterization of new deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) based compounds containing [2.2]paracyclophane moiety are reported. The DNA molecule was functionalized with hexadecyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTMA), [2.2]paracyclophane-4-methoxy-5-formyl [A] and [2.2] paracyclophane-4-hydroxy-5-formyl [B], respectively. These compounds were used for obtaining good optical quality thin films by spin coating method. The absorption and emission spectra of studied solutions and thin films showed that the new obtained materials are of good optical properties. The third order nonlinear optical (NLO) properties of thin films were characterized by the optical third-harmonic generation technique at 1064.2 nm fundamental wavelength. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The T-4(2) - (4)A(2) and E-2 - (4)A(2) fluorescence spectra with a dominant anti-Stokes component were observed. Though no optical refrigeration was detected in the presented experiments, the spectroscopic results suggest that electron-phonon bands of Cr3+ ions are of interest for further investigations from the point of view of achieving optical refrigeration.

AB Laser materials are very important for fabricating laser devices. In this paper, a new type of graphene oxide-like with hydroxyl groups (GOLH) was synthesized for developing pulse laser devices. GOLH was characterized by fourier transform infrared, X-ray diffraction, elemental analysis, scanning electron microscopy, Raman spectra and dynamic light scattering. Experimental results showed that GOLH contained mainly one kind of substituent, hydroxyl group. Average size of GOLH was about 1.5 mu m. Its optoelectronic properties were studied by a Q-switched pulse laser. Experimental results suggested that GOLH would be employed as a saturable absorber. A Q-switched pulse laser with the GOLH materials exhibited stable signal intensity and narrow pulse duration, 0.8 mu s. Therefore, GOLH would be potential pulse laser materials.

AB In this paper, we propose a rigorous configuration of graphene coated surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor with Tungsten Disulfide (WS2) for sensing DNA hybridization. The present configuration is consisted of prism (SF10 glass), Gold (Au), WS2- graphene and sensing medium. We perform the performance parameters of the proposed sensor in terms of sensitivity, detection accuracy and quality factor. Here we report a dramatic enhancement of the overall performance. Addition of graphene layers increase the sensitivity but decrease the other performance parameters. To increase the all performance parameters we add WS2 between metal and graphene layer. Furthermore in this paper, the thickness effect of Gold (Au) is also analyzed. Numerical analysis shows that the variation of SPR angle for mismatched DNA strands is quiet negligible whereas that for complementary DNA strands is considerably countable. Therefore, the proposed biosensor opens a new window towards detection for biomolecular interactions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Laser induced wavefront distortion is critical for designing and evaluation of optical components for high-power laser and can affect performance and stability of optical systems. The analysis of this effect involves a complex thermoelastic problem only solved in simplified conditions such as the plane-stress or plane-strain configurations. For more realistic descriptions, numerical solutions are required, although recent advances allowed for a unified model to describe the optical path change, regardless of the sample thickness, assuming a sample of infinite radius. In this work, we extend this result for the case of a thick disk sample by solving the set of differential equations governing the thermoelastic response for the finite radius configuration. These results could represent a significant contribution for designing and characterization of laser systems with potential application in many photothermal methods for material characterization.

AB Visibly transparent metal oxide diodes were fabricated using p-type doped zinc oxide on tin doped indium oxide coated substrates by sol-gel solution processing. The influence of various nitrogen doping concentration on the hole carrier concentration and the device operation of the diodes was investigated. The diodes exhibit high optical transmission in the visible spectra and high on/off ratios at low operating voltages. The operation is limited by the low hole carrier concentration, which affects the ideality factor and the series resistance of the diode. The influence of the carrier concentration on electronic properties of the diode will be discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The study highlighted enhanced performance of SnO2 based DSSC using photoanode with nano structured morphology. The simple organic surfactant free hydrothermal synthesis method was used for preparation of SnO2 nanoflowers for dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC) application. The hydrothermal reaction time was varied to obtain different SnO2 nanostructures. The hydrothermal reaction time showed considerable effect on optical and structural properties of the prepared samples. The results indicated that the prepared samples were pure rutile SnO2. The band gap of prepared samples was greater than bulk SnO2 and varied from 3.64 to 3.81 eV with increase in hydrothermal reaction time. With increase in reaction time from 4 to 24 h, the microstructure of SnO2 changed from agglomerated nanoparticles to nanopetals and finally to self-assembled nanoflowers. Flower-like SnO2 nanostructures showed size around 300-700 nm, and composed of large numbers of 3 dimensional petals connected with each other forming 3D nanoflowers by self-assembly. Consequently, the DSSC with flower-like SnO2 nanostructures exhibited good photovoltaic performance with Voc, Jsc and eta about 0.43 V, 4.36 mA/cm(2) and 1.11%, respectively. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Solid solutions LuxY1-xPO4 doped with Eu3+ were synthesized by the sol-gel method. Luminescence spectra under UV and X-ray excitation and luminescence excitation spectra in the UV-VUV energy range are presented. Observed variations of the structure of 4f-4f Eu3+ lines with the composition of the solid solution are explained by the fluctuations in the distribution of substitutional cations. The role of electronic structure modification in the fundamental absorption region with changing Y/Lu ratio is discussed and is suggested as the origin of different efficiency of energy transfer to Eu3+ in this region. Temperature dependence of the luminescence yield is related to the competition between emission centers and traps. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB By simple hydrothermal method, nanorods of barium boate were successfully loaded on reduced graphene oxide sheets. Powder XRD confirms the incorporation of barium borate (2 theta = 29 degrees, (202)) along with the transition of graphene oxide (2 theta = 12 degrees, (001)) into reduced graphene oxide (2 theta = 25 degrees, (002)). In the FTIR spectra, presence of characteristic absorption peaks of rGO (1572 and 2928 cm(-1)) and barium borate (510, 760 and 856 cm(-1)) further evidences the formation of BBO:rGO nanocomposite. FESEM images potray the existence of graphene sheets as thin layers and growth of barium borate as nanorods on the sheets of reduced graphene oxide. Ground state absorption studies reveal the hypsochromic shift in the absorption maxima of the graphene layers due to reduction of graphene oxide and hypochromic shift in the absorbance intensity due to the inclusion of highly transparent barium bortae. The photoluminescence of BBO:rGO shows maximum emission in the UV region arising from the direct transitions involving the valence band and conduction band in the band gap region. Z-scan technique using CW diode pumped Nd:YAG laser (532 nm, 50 mW) exposes that both nanocomposite and individual counterpart possess saturable absorption and self-defocusing behavior. Third-order nonlinear optical coefficients of BBO:rGO nanocomposite is found to be higher than bare graphene oxide. In particular the nonlinear refractive index of nanocomposite is almost four times higher than GO which resulted in superior optical power limiting action. Strong nonlinear refraction (self-defocusing) and lower onset limiting thershold makes the BBO:rGO nanocomposite preferable candidate for laser safety devices. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Refractive index sensing of liquid is important in the domain of chemistry and biology. Fiber optical sensors provide an excellent way to measure the refractive index due to their feasible integration to other fiber optics components, high sensitivity, small size, and distributed sensing. However, conventional optical sensors have different shortages. To find a practical way to measure the refractive index of liquid, this paper intended to combine Carbon Nanotube (CNT) with non-core fiber (NCF) to prepare a kind of modal interferometer sensor and to explore the effect of CNT coating on refractive index sensing properties of the modal interferometer. Firstly, a structure of single mode non-core single mode (SNS) fiber with a CNT film coating was proposed and simulated. The simulation results showed that the CNT coating could improve the refractive index sensitivity of the interferometer sensor. Then in the experiment part, the CNT solution was fabricated and deposited onto the NCF, and a refractive index sensing system was built to examine the property of the CNT-coated SNS interferometer sensor. During the experiment, the influence factors of sensitivity were summarized by testing the sensing performance under different conditions, and it was demonstrated that the CNT coating could improve the contrast of the interference spectrum, and also had the possibility to increase the refractive index sensitivity of the interferometer sensor.

AB Milled powder of ordered defect compound (ODC) CuIn3Se5 phase was successfully synthesized via milling process. Thin films of CuIn3Se5 were deposited onto glass substrates at room temperature by thermal evaporation technique. The obtained layers were annealed in vacuum and air atmosphere. The structural and compositional properties of the powder were analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Powder XRD characterization, Rietveld analysis and chemical bounding confirm the tetragonal ordered defect compound phase formation with lattice constants a = 5.732 angstrom and c 11.575 angstrom. Thin films were characterized by XRD, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and UV/Vis spectroscopy. Transmittance (T) and reflectance (R) spectra were measured in the spectral range of 300-1800 nm. The absorption coefficient a exhibits high values in the visible range and reaches a value, of 10(5) cm(-1). The band gap energy E-g of the annealed thin films is estimated to be approximately 1.75 eV. The refractive index n was estimated from transmittance data using Swanepoel's method. The refractive indices of the films as a function of wavelengths can be fitted with Cauchy dispersion equation. The oscillator energy E-0, dispersion energy E-d, zero frequency refractive index no, high frequency dielectric constant so, and the carrier concentration per effective mass N/m* values were determined from the analysis of the experimental data using Wemple-Di-Domenico and Spitzer-Fan models. We exploited the refractive index dispersion for the determination of the magneto-optical constant V, which characterizes the Faraday rotation. The nonlinear optical parameters namely nonlinear susceptibility chi((3)), nonlinear refractive index and nonlinear absorption coefficient beta are investigated for the first time for CuIn3Se5 material.

AB Non-rare-earth Bi was firstly used as sensitizer on Ho3+: 2.0 gm emission for its mid-infrared applications in successfully prepared germanosilicate glass under 808 nm excitation. Sensitization mechanism has been analyzed theoretically through matched energy transfer processes based on the measured absorption, fluorescence spectra and calculated luminous parameters. Meanwhile, typical broadband near-infrared (NIR) emission band of Bi ions has also been obtained in present germanosilicate glass, which shifts to a longer wavelength with Ho3+ co-doped owing to the different of Bi-related active centers. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy demonstrated that the addition of Ho3+ lead to the part valence conversion among the mixed-valence state of Bi. All results reveal that Bi/Ho co-doped germanosilicate glass might provide a new choice for 2.0 mu m laser applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The chalcogenide thin films belongs to a special category of important materials due to the unique IR transparency and light induced linear and non linear optical properties change. The optical band gap tuning in thermally evaporated As40Se53Sb07 chalcogenide thin film is being probed under the influence of 532 nm laser illumination. The gradual decrease in transmission and red shift of optical absorption edge with illumination at different time scale is recorded by Fourier transmission infrared spectroscopy. The simultaneous increase in refractive index and absorption coefficient of the illuminated film makes the material as useful candidate for optical switching. The dispersion of refractive index is being analyzed by using Wemple DiDomenico (WDD) single oscillator model and static refractive index (no) has also been reported. The exponential decrease of optical band gap with time is attributed to the increase in density of localized states and vacancies. The entire mechanism is explained by the microscopic model in which heteropolar bonds are converted to homopolar ones by the absorption of high energy photons investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectra. The amorphous nature of the studied films was revealed from X-ray diffraction and composition of the film was determined from energy dispersive X-ray analysis. The surface morphology was determined from the scanning electron microscopy. The optical change in absorption coefficient, refractive index, band gap by influence in laser irradiation in such materials may be suitable for optical disc(memory) application for optical time division switch.

AB We have incorporated chloro boron subphthalocyanine (CI-BsubPc) and chloro boron subnapthalocyanines (C1-ClnBsubNcs) into organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) that enabled. an overall warm white emission with CIE coordinates close to that of a 60 W incandescent lightbulb. More specifically, we have shown that Cl-BsubPc and CI-CInBsubNcs can be used as dopant emitters in a simple host-dopant architecture, and we have compared the use of NPB and Alga as potential hosts for these materials. When doped into Alga, Cl-BsubPc shows a strong orange emission, and CI-CInBsubNcs shows a moderately strong red emission. We have further demonstrated that Cl-BsubPc and Cl-ClnBsubNcs can be co-doped into the same layer giving combined orange and red emission peaks. A "cascade" energy transfer mechanism of sequential absorption and re-emission is proposed. Device performance characteristics such as luminance, current efficiency, photoluminescence efficiency, and external quantum efficiency are tabulated. Additionally, in view of ongoing research into white emitting OLEDs for indoor lighting purposes, the Colour Rendering Index (CRI), R9 values, and CIE co-ordinates for these devices are also discussed. We conclude from this study that the BsubNc chromophore has potential application as a red dopant in OLEDs including for indoor lighting. Additionally, given the scope for axial and peripheral derivatization of the BsubNc motif, we believe that this chromophore has many unexplored molecular design handles that will affect its ultimate performance and application in OLEDs and other optoelectronic devices.

AB Paper reports the synthesis and spectroscopic studies of two novel 1-Methyl-3-phenyl-1H-pyrazolo[3,4bjquinoxaline (PQX) derivatives with 6-substituted methyl (MeMPPQX) or methoxy (MeOMPPQX) side groups. The optical absorption and fluorescence emission spectra are recorded in solvents of different polarity. Steady state and time-resolved spectroscopy provide photophysical characterization of MeMPPQX and MeOMPPQX dyes as materials for potential luminescence or electroluminescence applications. Measured optical absorption and, fluorescence emission spectra are compared with quantum chemical DFT/TDDFT calculations using long-range corrected xc-functionals, LRC-BLYP and CAM-B3LYP in combination with self-consistent reaction field model based on linear response (LR), state specific (SS) or corrected linear response (CLR) solvations. Performances of relevant theoretical models and approaches are compared. The reparameterized LRC-BLYP functional (omega = 0.231 Bohr(-1)) in combination with CLR solvation provides most accurate prediction of both excitation and emission energies. The MeMPPQX and MeOMPPQX dyes represent efficient fluorescence emitters in blue-green region of the visible spectra. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The femtosecond-laser-induced damage behaviors of metal multilayer dielectric gratings (MMDG) for pulse compression are explored. The grating ridge of this type of MMDG consists of a layer of HfO2 sandwiched between two SiO2 layers. The initial damage position is on the HfO2 layer of the ridge which opposite to the laser beam direction. A theoretical model is constructed to explain the femto-secondlaser-induced damage initiation mechanism on the MMDG, and the model can simulate the evolution of the electron density in the conduction band and the change of the dielectric constants of HfO2 and SiO2 in the sandwiched grating structure. The dramatic increase in the imaginary part of the dielectric constant of the middle HfO2 layer indicates that it strongly absorbs laser energy, resulting in damage to the MMDG. The experimental results and theoretical calculation agree very well with each other. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Generation of primary colors and white light through frequency upconversion using sol-gel derived 80SiO(2):20PbF(2) vitroceramic phosphors doped with Er3+, Er3+/Yb3+, Tm3+/Yb3+, and Er3+/Tm3+/Yb3+ excited at 980 nm is demonstrated. For Er3+ and Er3+/Yb3+ doped samples emissions were obtained in the blue (410 nm), green (530, and 550 nm) and red (670 nm) regions, corresponding to the H-2(9/2) -> (4)I(5/)2, H-2(11/2) ? I-4(15/2), S-4(3/2) -> I-4(152) and F-4(9/2) -> I-4(15/2) transitions of Er3+, respectively. The codoping with Yb3+ ions altered the spectral profile of most of the emissions compared to the single doped samples, resulting in changes in the emitted color, in addition to a significant increase in the emission intensity. In Tm3+/Yb3+ co-doped samples visible emissions in the blue (480 nm), and red (650 nm), corresponding to transitions (1)G(4) -> H-3(6) and (1)G(4) -> F-3(4) of Tm3+, respectively, were obtained. The emission intensity around 480 nm overcome the red emission, and luminescence showed a predominantly blue tone. White light with CIE-1931 coordinates (0.36; 0.34) was produced by homogeneously mixing up powders of heat treated at 400 degrees C co-doped samples 5.0Er(3+)/5.0Yb(3+) and 0.5Tm(3+)/2.5Yb(3+) in the mass ratio of 13%, and 87%, respectively. The measured emission spectrum for a sample resulting from the mixture showed a profile with very good agreement with the spectrum found from the superimposition of the spectra of the co-doped samples.

AB We develop an effective method for glucose sensing by using a plasmonic color filter (PCF) integrated with a microfluidic chip. The morphology of PCF is composed of hybrid nanopillars fabricated with SiO2 and Au thin-films on silicon substrate. It exhibits angle-independence, polarization-independence and wafer-level fabrication, which are the most important factors for color filters for industrial applications. The shift of resonant wavelength is 56 nm with a stable bandwidth (similar to 30 nm) by varying concentration of glucose solution. The sensitivity is 157.61 nm/RIU and the corresponding figure-of-merit is 5.25. Such strategy can be exploited to further increase the detection and potentially enter the ultra-strong coupling regime in chemical solution sensors. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Growth of Tm, Ho singly-doped and Tm/Ho co-doped CaLaGa3O7 crystals by Czochralski method are investigated for the first time. The polarized absorption spectra, fluorescence spectra and luminescence decay curves of Tm: CaLaGa3O7, Ho: CaLaGa3O7 and Tm/Ho: CaLaGa3O7 crystals are reported. Based on the JuddOfelt theory and the polarized absorption spectra, the spontaneous transition probabilities, the fluorescent branching ratios and the radiative lifetimes were calculated. The crystals exhibit a broad emission band at about 2.0 mu m, corresponding to F-3(4) -> (3)(H)6 of Tm3+ and I-5(7) -> I-5(8) of Ho3+, respectively. The energy transfer parameters in Tm/Ho: CaLaGa3O7 crystal between Tm3+ and Ho3+ are theoretically analyzed. These results show that Tm: CaLaGa3O7, Ho: CaLaGa3O7 and Tm/Ho: CaLaGa3O7 crystals are excellent potential tunable laser media for the similar to 2.0 mu m regions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Oxygen vacancies represented by F and F-2 centers were detected in faceted Al2O3 nanoparticles with the size less than 10 nm by a photoluminescence method. Al2O3 nanoparticles with such intrinsic defects were synthesized by evaporation of cz-Al2O3 in flowing helium using a continuous wave CO2 laser. The XRD analysis showed that the crystal structure of Al2O3 nanoparticles is represented mostly by the low temperature gamma- and/or eta-A1203 phases. The luminescence maxima of F and F-2 centers in the Al2O3 nanoparticles were found to be 3.07 and 2.47 eV. These values are close to the luminescence maxima of F and F-2 centers in bulk alpha-Al2O3.
