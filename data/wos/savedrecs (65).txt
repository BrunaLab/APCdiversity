AB The photoluminescence properties of Yb3+ sensitized Er3+ doped BaLa2(MoO4)(4), SrLa2(MoO4)(4) and CaLa2(MoO4)(4) phosphors synthesized via hydrothermal method are investigated upon 980 nm and 380 nm light excitations. The phase, purity, and morphology of the samples are characterized by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and Field emission scanning electron microscope. Among these three phosphors, the strongest emission intensity is seen in BaLa2(MoO4)(4): Er3+/Yb3+ through both the 980 nm and 380 nm light excitations and is explained by the lifetime measurement of S-4(3/2) level of Er3+ ion. Temperature sensing measurements were performed by using the fluorescence intensity ratio (FIR) of green emission bands originated from the two thermally coupled H-2(11/2) -> I-4(15/2) and S-4(3//2) -> I-4(15/2) transitions of Er3+ and maximum temperature sensitivity of 1.05% K-1 at 305 K is found for BLa2(MoO4)(4): Er3+/Yb3+ sample. Moreover, the laser induced heating is measured in the samples and the maximum temperature of the sample particles is calculated as 422 K at 76 W/cm(2) in BaLa2(MoO4)(4): Er3+/Yb3+, pointing out large amount of heat generation in such phosphors. The BaLa2(MoO4)(4): Er3+/Yb3+ also exhibits higher photothermal conversion efficiency of 46.7%. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB In this work the use of a S-tetrazine (NITZ) molecule with down-shifting capability to improve the stability of perovskite solar cells is reported. Indeed perovskite solar cells are known to present a high sensitivity to UV light and one strategy to overcome this issue is to actually supress the UV from the illumination light. The NITZ down-shifting molecule is well suited for this application since it has the particularity to be excited in the near-UV region and to emit into the visible light spectrum, giving the possibility to recycle UV photons for additional current generation. Through current-voltage curves, incident-photon-to-electron conversion efficiency, and photoluminescence spectroscopy characterization we show that NITZ presents an emission quantum yield of 30% which allows to reduce the loss of JSC induced by the use of a conventional UV filter, even if a net gain in photocurrent is not achieved in our case. We also present a simple prediction of the ability of a down-shifting molecule to efficiently perform for a specific active material. Moreover, we finally discuss the possibility to improve using such down-shifting strategy, the performance of some perovskite solar cells based on alternatives electron-transporting layers such as WO3, which are known to alter the active layer performance following UV light absorption.

AB We have proposed a novel temperature-sensitive luminescent material which is a 20 mu m thick vitrified film (sandwiched between two quartz plates) fabricated from an amorphous powder of a mesogenic europium(III) beta-diketonate complex through a melt-processing technique. The film photoexcited by a 337 nm pulsed nitrogen laser displays a typical Eu3+ ion luminescence bands with the strongest peak at 612 nm and with the decay time of 537 mu s at 298 K. It is obtained that both the mean luminescence intensity and the luminescence decay time at 612 nm decrease significantly with temperature increasing from 298 to 348 K; the average values of the relative and absolute temperature sensitivities of the luminescence decay time in the range of 298-348 K are -1.2%.K-1 and -6.5 mu s.K-1, respectively. The thermal quenching mechanism of the luminescent properties was analyzed and discussed. The experiments showed that, the luminescent properties of the film is insensitive to oxygen, the film is photostable under UV light, there is full reversibility of the temperature-dependent luminescence intensity and the decay time, and the high luminescence brightness of the film can be observed with violet light excitation. These factors indicated that the film is promising material for reusable luminescent thermometers, suitable for long-term monitoring in the range of 298-348 K. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB The volume and size of the voids present between the frit and the phosphor particles used before sintering determine the pore properties of the resulting phosphor-in-glass (PIG). The pores formed from the voids influence the path of the incident light, thus changing the optical properties of the PIG. Therefore, the trends observed for the shrinkage and the green and sintered densities of the PIG were investigated using SiO2-B2O3-ZnO-K2O glass fit of four sizes to understand the tendency for the pore size, porosity, and optical properties of PIG. It has been demonstrated that variation in the pore properties according to the particle size influences parameters defining the light scattering phenomenon, such as the scattering angle of the light and the scattering coefficient, as well as the color rendering index, correlated color temperature, and package efficacy. The results obtained for the variation in the optical properties with the frit size can be used as a reference to select the appropriate glass frit size to achieve the required optical properties for a light-emitting diode (LED) package.

AB Multiple scattering induced haze and depolarization effects of nano-porous AAO films controlled by detuning the porosity and aspect ratio of the nano holes are investigated. The nano-porous AAO film with its porosity increasing from 12.6% to 19.3% enhances the scattering of the incident laser beam with its maximal scattering angle enlarged from 5 degrees to 8 degrees under TM-mode incidence and from 6 degrees to 10 degrees under TE-mode incidence. Because of multiple scattering within the porous holes of the AAO, the depolarization on the reflected beam by transferring its electric field from horizontal to the vertical such that the polarization ratio is degraded with a randomized haze. The porosity of AAO surface broadens from 12.6% to 19.3% when increasing the bias voltage from 40 to 60 V during the second-step of the electro-chemical anodization process, which essentially adjusts the polarization ratio under TM-mode and TE-mode incidences raise from 0.31 to 035 and from 032 to 0.48, respectively. The depolarized haze of the nano porous AAO film is correlated with its porosity and aspect ratio controlled by the pore size and etched depth of the AAO. Under TM-mode incidence, the simulated polarization ratio increases from 0.35 to 0.38, which correlates well with experimental results. In contrast, the experiment result slightly deviates from the theoretical prediction as the TE-mode field interacts more surface area than the TM-mode field does. Such a nano-porous AAO exhibits tunable depolarized haze via the control porosity and aspect ratio, which is particularly suitable to serve as the catalytic buffer for synthesizing the hydrophobic and hazed solar energy converters.

AB Azo waveguide polymers are of particular interest in the design of materials for applications in optical switch. The aim of this contribution was the synthesis and thermo-optic waveguide switch properties of azo biphenyl polyurethanes. A series of monomers and azo biphenyl polyurethanes (Azo BPU1 and Azo BPU2) were synthesized and characterized by FT-IR, UV-Vis spectroscopy and H-1 NMR. The physical and mechanical properties of thin polymer films were measured. The refractive index and thermo-optic coefficient (dn/dT) of polymer films were investigated for TE (transversal electric) polarizations by ATR technique. The transmission loss of film was measured using the Charge Coupled Device digital imaging devices. The results showed the Azo BPU2 containing chiral azobenzene chromophore had higher dn/dT and lower transmission loss. Subsequently, a 1 x 2 Y-branch and 2 x 2 Mach-Zehnder optical switches based on the prepared polymers were designed and simulated. The results showed that the power consumption of all switches was less than 1.0 mW. Compared with 1 x 2 Y-branch optical switch, the 2 x 2 Mach-Zehnder optical switches based on the same polymer have the faster response time, which were about only 1.2 and 2.0 ms, respectively.

AB NiO/xFe(2)O(3) nanoparticles (NPs) with different Fe2O3 content of (x = 0.0, 0.3, 0.5 and 1) have been synthesized by microwave irradiation method. For more investigations, the solution of these NPs have been dropped on top of the glass substrate. The prepared films of the synthesized materials have been characterized by elemental analysis such as X-ray diffraction and Transmission electron microscope. An analysis of the phase composition and microstructure shows that Fe2O3 content has slightly influence on the crystal structure and morphology of NiO NPs, which reveals that the addition of Fe2O3 NPs has been incorporated into the NiO host lattice. A comparison between Fe2O3 and NiO NPs have been done using these analyses. The effect of Fe2O3 addition content in NiO lattice on the linear and nonlinear optical properties have been studied. The refractive index and the energy gap have been decreased by about 24% and 12.5% respectively with increasing Fe2O3 NPs contents. The improving optical conductivity of assembled films is verified due to the addition of Fe2O3 NPs. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB 2.9 mu m fluorescence properties and energy transfer mechanism in our prepared Er3+/Dy3+ co-doped fluoroaluminate glass (AYFT) have been investigated in this paper. As far as we know, it is the first time to report a broadband emission extending from 2500 to 3100 nm with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 270 nm obtained in Er3+/Dy3+ co-doped fluoroaluminate glass under 980 nm pump. The large spontaneous transition probability (59.46 s(-1)) calculated based on the Judd-Ofelt theory indicates the intensive Dy3+: H-6(13/2) -> H-6(15/2) transition which has happened to coincide with the emission spectra. Moreover, the high energy transfer efficiencies of Er3+: I-4(13/2) to Dy3+: H-6(11/2) (903%) and Er3+: to Dy3+: H-6(5/2) (85.1%) further confirmed the efficient population inversion of Dy3+: 2.9 gm emission. This present work suggests that Er3+/Dy3+ co-doped fluoroaluminate glass can be a potential candidate for mid-infrared broadband integrated amplifier. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In order to improve the luminescence property of silicate phosphors, a series of Sr(1.992-x)MgxSiO4: 0.008Eu(2+)(x = 0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75) blue phosphors have been synthesized using one-step calcination of a precursor prepared by chemical co-precipitation. And then the crystal structure and luminescence properties of the phosphors are investigated by means of X-Ray Diffraction and spectrophotometer. The results show that beta-phase existed in the mixed phases of Sr2SiO4 (beta+alpha') would transform to alpha'-phase with Mg2+ ions doping into the silicate host until it disappeared. On the other hand, the introduction of Mg2+ ions can enhance the intensity of the excitation spectrum and promote the excitation sensitivity of Sr0.992-x)MgxSiO4: 0.008Eu(2+) phosphors in NUV region. Under NUV excitation at 350 nm, all samples exhibit a broadband emission in range of 400-550 nm due to the 4f(6)5d(1) -> 4f(7)(S-8(7/2)) transition of Eu2+ ions. According to Multi-peak fitting to emission spectra by Gauss method, the broad emission band consists of two single bands with peaks Em(1) and Em(2) locating at 460 and 490 nm, which corresponds to Eu2+ ions occupying the ten-fold oxygen-coordinated Sr-1 site and the nine-fold oxygen-coordinated Sr-2 site, respectively. The luminescence intensity of Sr(1.992-x)MgxSiO4:0.008Eu(2+)(x = 0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75) blue phosphors has been enhanced remarkably after Mg2+ ions are added. Meanwhile, the chromaticity coordinates change from the blue-green region to the blue region as x moves from 0 to 0.75. Moreover, the decay curves are measured and can be well fitted with double exponential decay equation. It shows that the average lifetime is extended with the concentration of Mg2+ ions increasing. These results indicate that Sr(1.992-x)MgxSiO4: 0.008Eu(2+) (x = 0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75) can be used as a potential blue phosphor in near UV-excited white LEDs. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Recent studies have identified the importance of vegetation processes in terrestrial hydrologic systems. Process-based ecohydrological models combine hydrological, physical, biochemical and ecological processes of the catchments, and as such are generally more complex and parametric than conceptual hydrological models. Thus, appropriate calibration objectives and model uncertainty analysis are essential for ecohydrological modeling. In recent years, Bayesian inference has become one of the most popular tools for quantifying the uncertainties in hydrological modeling with the development of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. The Bayesian approach offers an appealing alternative to traditional multi objective hydrologic model calibrations by defining proper prior distributions that can be considered analogous to the ad-hoc weighting often prescribed in multi-objective calibration. Our study aims to develop appropriate prior distributions and likelihood functions that minimize the model uncertainties and bias within a Bayesian ecohydrological modeling framework based on a traditional Pareto-based model calibration technique. In our study, a Pareto-based multi-objective optimization and a formal Bayesian framework are implemented in a conceptual ecohydrological model that combines a hydrological model (HYMOD) and a modified Bucket Grassland Model (BGM). Simulations focused on one objective (streamflow/LAI) and multiple objectives (streamflow and LAI) with different emphasis defined via the prior distribution of the model error parameters. Results show more reliable outputs for both predicted streamflow and LAI using Bayesian multi-objective calibration with specified prior distributions for error parameters based on results from the Pareto front in the ecohydrological modeling. The methodology implemented here provides insight into the usefulness of multiobjective Bayesian calibration for ecohydrologic systems and the importance of appropriate prior distributions in such approaches.

AB Problems with water resources restrict the sustainable development of a city with water shortages. Based on system dynamics (SD) theory, a model of sustainable utilization of water resources using the STELLA software has been established. This model consists of four subsystems: population system, economic system, water supply system and water demand system. The boundaries of the four subsystems are vague, but they are closely related and interdependent. The model is applied to Zhengzhou City, China, which has a serious water shortage. The difference between the water supply and demand is very prominent in Zhengzhou City. The model was verified with data from 2009 to 2013. The results show that water demand of Zhengzhou City will reach 2.57 billion m(3) in 2020. A water resources optimization model is developed based on interval-parameter two-stage stochastic programming. The objective of the model is to allocate water resources to each water sector and make the lowest cost under the minimum water demand. Using the simulation results, decision makers can easily weigh the costs of the system, the water allocation objectives, and the system risk. The hybrid system dynamics method and optimization model is a rational try to support water resources management in many cities, particularly for cities with potential water shortage and it is solidly supported with previous studies and collected data.

AB The impact of urbanization on streamflow depends on a variety of factors (e.g., climate, initial land cover, inter-basin transfers, water withdrawals, wastewater effluent, etc.). The purpose of this study is to examine trends in streamflow from 1986 to 2015 in a range of watersheds within the rapidly urbanizing Atlanta, GA metropolitan area. This study compares eight watersheds over three decades, while minimizing the influence of inter-annual precipitation variability. Population and land-cover data were used to analyze changes over approximately twenty years within the watersheds. Precipitation totals for the watersheds were estimated using precipitation totals at nearby weather stations. Multiple streamflow variables, such as annual streamflow, frequencies of high-flow days (HFDs), flashiness, and precipitation-adjusted streamflow, for the eight streams were calculated using daily streamflow data. Variables were tested for significant trends from 1986 to 2015 and significant differences between 1986-2000 and 2001-2015. Flashiness increased for all streams without municipal water withdrawals, and the four watersheds with the largest increase in developed land had significant increases in flashiness. Significant positive trends in precipitation-adjusted mean annual streamflow and HFDs occurred for the two watersheds (Big Creek and Suwanee Creek) that experienced the largest increases in development, and these were the only watersheds that went from majority forest land in 1986 to majority developed land in 2015. With a disproportionate increase in HFD occurrence during summer, Big Creek and Suwannee Creek also had a reduction in intra-annual variability of HFD occurrence. Watersheds that were already substantially developed at the beginning of the period and did not have wastewater discharge had declining streamflow. The most urbanized watershed (Peachtree Creek) had a significant decrease in streamflow, and a possible cause of the decrease was increasing groundwater infiltration into sewers. The impacts of urbanization on streamflow within the metropolitan area have undoubtedly been felt by a wide of range of communities. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Groundwater management authorities usually use groundwater budget calculations to evaluate the sustainability of withdrawals for different purposes. The groundwater budget calculation does not always provide reliable information, and it must often be supported by further aquifer monitoring in the case of hydraulic connections between neighboring aquifers.
   The Riardo Plain aquifer is a strategic drinking resource for more than 100,000 people, water storage for 60 km(2) of irrigated land, and the source of a mineral water bottling plant. Over a long period, the comparison between the direct recharge and the estimated natural outflow and withdrawals highlights a severe water deficit of approximately 40% of the total groundwater outflow. A groundwater budget deficit should be a clue to the aquifer depletion, but the results of long-term water level monitoring allowed the observation of the good condition of this aquifer. In fact, in the Riardo Plain, the calculated deficit is not comparable to the aquifer monitoring data acquired in the same period (1992-2014). The small oscillations of the groundwater level and the almost stable streambed spring discharge allows the presumption of an additional aquifer recharge source.
   The confined carbonate aquifer locally mixes with the above volcanic aquifer, providing an externally stable recharge that reduces the effects of the local rainfall variability.
   The combined approach of the groundwater budget results and long-term aquifer monitoring (spring discharge and/or hydraulic head oscillation) provides information about significant external groundwater exchanges, even if unidentified by field measurements, and supports the stakeholders in groundwater resource management.

AB Fine sediment plays crucial and multiple roles in the hydrological, ecological and geomorphological functioning of river systems. This study employs a two-dimensional (2D) numerical model to track the hydro morphological processes dominated by fine suspended sediment, including the prediction of sediment concentration in flow bodies, and erosion and deposition caused by sediment transport. The model is governed by 2D full shallow water equations with which an advection diffusion equation for fine sediment is coupled. Bed erosion and sedimentation are updated by a bed deformation model based on local sediment entrainment and settling flux in flow bodies. The model is initially validated with the three laboratory-scale experimental events where suspended load plays a dominant role. Satisfactory simulation results confirm the model's capability in capturing hydro-morphodynamic processes dominated by fine suspended sediment at laboratory-scale. Applications to sedimentation in a stormwater pond are conducted to develop the process-based understanding of fine sediment dynamics over a variety of flow conditions. Urban flows with 5-year, 30-year and 100-year return period and the extreme flood event in 2012 are simulated. The modelled results deliver a step change in understanding fine sediment dynamics in stormwater ponds. The model is capable of quantitatively simulating and qualitatively assessing the performance of a stormwater pond in managing urban water quantity and quality. (C) 2017 The Author(s).

AB Regional climate models (RCMs) are used to downscale the coarse resolution General Circulation Model (GCM) outputs to a finer resolution for hydrological impact studies. However, RCM outputs often deviate from the observed climatological data, and therefore need bias correction before they are used for hydrological simulations. While there are a number of methods for bias correction, most of them use monthly statistics to derive correction factors, which may cause errors in the rainfall magnitude when applied on a daily scale. This study proposes a sliding window based daily correction factor derivations that help build reliable daily rainfall data from climate models. The procedure is applied to five existing bias correction methods, and is tested on six watersheds in different climatic zones of India for assessing the effectiveness of the corrected rainfall and the consequent hydrological simulations. The bias correction was performed on rainfall data downscaled using Conformal Cubic Atmospheric Model (CCAM) to 0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees from two different CMIP5 models (CNRM-CM5.0, GFDL-CM3.0). The India Meteorological Department (IMD) gridded (0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees) observed rainfall data was considered to test the effectiveness of the proposed bias correction method. The quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plots and Nash Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) were employed for evaluation of different methods of bias correction. The analysis suggested that the proposed method effectively corrects the daily bias in rainfall as compared to using monthly factors. The methods such as local intensity scaling, modified power transformation and distribution mapping, which adjusted the wet day frequencies, performed superior compared to the other methods, which did not consider adjustment of wet day frequencies. The distribution mapping method with daily correction factors was able to replicate the daily rainfall pattern of observed data with NSE value above 0.81 over most parts of India. Hydrological simulations forced using the bias corrected rainfall (distribution mapping and modified power transformation methods that used the proposed daily correction factors) was similar to those simulated by the IMD rainfall. The results demonstrate that the methods and the time scales used for bias correction of RCM rainfall data have a larger impact on the accuracy of the daily rainfall and consequently the simulated streamflow. The analysis suggests that the distribution mapping with daily correction factors can be preferred for adjusting RCM rainfall data irrespective of seasons or climate zones for realistic simulation of streamflow.

AB The flow in the main channel of a meandering compound channel does not occur in the ridge direction because of the effect of the upstream floodplain flows. This study proposes a model for estimating the flow direction in the depth-averaged two-dimensional domain (depth-averaged flow angles) between the entrance and the apex sections. Detailed velocity measurements were performed in the region between the meander entrance section and apex section in a large-scale meandering compound channel. The vertical size of the secondary current cell is highly related to the depth-averaged flow angle; thus, the means of the local flow angles above the secondary current cell and within the cell are separately discussed. The experimental measurements indicate that the mean local flow angle above the cell is equal to the section angle, whereas the mean local flow angle within the cell is equal to zero. The proposed model is validated using published data from five sources. Good agreement is obtained between the predictions and measurements, indicating that the proposed model can accurately estimate the depth averaged flow direction in the meandering compound channels. Finally, the limitations and application ranges of the model are discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Regionalization methods have long been used to estimate high return levels of river discharges at ungauged locations on a river network. In these methods, discharge measurements from a homogeneous group of similar, gauged, stations are used to estimate high quantiles at a target location that has no observations. The similarity of this group to the ungauged location is measured in terms of a hydrological distance measuring differences in physical and meteorological catchment attributes. We develop a statistical method for estimation of high return levels based on regionalizing the parameters of a generalized extreme value distribution. The group of stations is chosen by optimizing over the attribute weights of the hydrological distance, ensuring similarity and in-group homogeneity. Our method is applied to discharge data from the Rhine basin in Switzerland, and its performance at ungauged locations is compared to that of other regionalization methods. For gauged locations we show how our approach improves the estimation uncertainty for long return periods by combining local measurements with those from the chosen group. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB One of the important issues in hydrological modelling is to specify the initial conditions of the catchment since it has a major impact on the response of the model. Although this issue should be a high priority among modelers, it has remained unaddressed by the community. The typical suggested warm-up period for the hydrological models has ranged from one to several years, which may lead to an underuse of data. The model warm-up is an adjustment process for the model to reach an 'optimal' state, where internal stores (e.g., soil moisture) move from the estimated initial condition to an 'optimal' state. This study explores the warm-up period of two conceptual hydrological models, HYMOD and IHACRES, in a southwestern England catchment. A series of hydrologic simulations were performed for different initial soil moisture conditions and different rainfall amounts to evaluate the sensitivity of the warm-up period. Evaluation of the results indicates that both initial wetness and rainfall amount affect the time required for model warm up, although it depends on the structure of the hydrological model. Approximately one and a half months are required for the model to warm up in HYMOD for our study catchment and climatic conditions. In addition, it requires less time to warm up under wetter initial conditions (i.e., saturated initial conditions). On the other hand, approximately six months is required for warm-up in IHACRES, and the wet or dry initial conditions have little effect on the warm-up period. Instead, the initial values that are close to the optimal value result in less warm-up time. These findings have implications for hydrologic model development, specifically in determining soil moisture initial conditions and warm-up periods to make full use of the available data, which is very important for catchments with short hydrological records.

AB This study delivers new insights into rainfall-induced seal formation through a novel approach in the use of X-ray Computed Tomography (CT). Up to now seal and crust thickness have been directly quantified mainly through visual examination of sealed/crusted surfaces, and there has been no quantitative method to estimate this important property. X-ray CT images were quantitatively analysed to derive formal measures of seal and crust thickness. A factorial experiment was established in the laboratory using open-topped microcosms packed with soil. The factors investigated were soil type (three soils: silty clay loam - ZCL, sandy silt loam - SZL, sandy loam - SL) and rainfall duration (2-14 min). Surface seal formation was induced by applying artificial rainfall events, characterised by variable duration, but constant kinetic energy, intensity, and raindrop size distribution. Soil porosities derived from CT scans were used to quantify the thickness of the rainfall-induced surface seals and reveal temporal seal micro morphological variations with increasing rainfall duration. In addition, the water repellency and infiltration dynamics of the developing seals were investigated by measuring water drop penetration time (WDPT) and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity (K-un). The range of seal thicknesses detected varied from 0.6 to 5.4 mm. Soil textural characteristics and OM content played a central role in the development of rainfall-induced seals, with coarser soil particles and lower OM content resulting in thicker seals. Two different trends in soil porosity vs. depth were identified: i) for SL soil porosity was lowest at the immediate soil surface, it then increased constantly with depth till the median porosity of undisturbed soil was equalled; ii) for ZCL and SL the highest reduction in porosity, as compared to the median porosity of undisturbed soil, was observed in a well-defined zone of maximum porosity reduction c. 0.24-0.48 mm below the soil surface. This contrasting behaviour was related to different dynamics and processes of seal formation which depended on the soil properties. The impact of rainfall-induced surface sealing on the hydrological behaviour of soil (as represented by WDTP and K-un) was rapid and substantial: an average 60% reduction in K-un occurred for all soils between 2 and 9 min rainfall, and water repellent surfaces were identified for SZL and ZCL. This highlights that the condition of the immediate surface of agricultural soils involving rainfall-induced structural seals has a strong impact in the overall ability of soil to function as water reservoir.

AB The exchange of proglacial river water with active layer pore water could alter water chemical compositions in glacial outwash plains and oceanic solute fluxes. To evaluate effects of this exchange, we sampled Watson River and adjacent pore water during the 2013 melt season at two sandurs in western Greenland; one in Sandflugtdalen and the other near the confluence with Sondre Stromfjord. We measured temperature, specific conductivity, and head gradients between the river and bank over a week-long period at Sandflugtdalen, as well as sediment hydraulic conductivity and chemical compositions of waters from both sites. Specific conductivity of pore water is four to ten times greater than river water as solutes are concentrated from weathering reactions, cryoconcentration, and evaporation. Pore water compositions are predominantly altered by carbonate dissolution and sulfide mineral oxidation. High concentrations of HCO3 and SO4 result from solute recycling and dissolution of secondary Ca-Mg carbonate/sulfate salts initially formed by near-surface evaporation in the summer and at depth by freeze-in of the active layer and cryoconcentration in the winter. High hydraulic conductivity (10(-5) to 10(-4) m/s) and diurnal fluctuations of river stage during our study caused exchange of river and pore water immediately adjacent to the river channel, with a net loss of river water to the bank. Pore water >6 m from the river continuously flowed away from the river. Approximately 1-8% of the river discharge through the Sandflugtdalen was lost to the river bank during our 6.75 day study based on calculations using Darcy's Law. Although not sampled, some of this water should discharge to the river during low river stage early and late in the melt season. Elevated pore water solute concentrations in sandurs and water exchange at diurnal and seasonal frequency should impact fluxes of solutes to the ocean, although understanding the magnitude of this effect will require long-term evaluation throughout the melt season.

AB In order to continually improve the current understanding of flow and transport in crystalline bedrock environments, developing and improving fracture system characterization techniques is an important area of study. The presented research examines the installation of flexible, impermeable FLUTe (TM) liners as a means for assessing cross-hole fracture connectivity. FLUTe (TM) liners are used to generate a new style of hydraulic pulse, with pressure response monitored in a nearby network of open boreholes drilled in gneissic rock of the Canadian Shield in eastern Ontario, Canada. Borehole liners were installed in six existing 10-15 cm diameter boreholes located 10-35 m apart and drilled to depths ranging between 25-45 m. Liner installation tests were completed consecutively with the number of observation wells available for each test ranging between one and six. The collected pressure response data have been analyzed to identify significant groundwater flow paths between source and observation boreholes as well as to estimate inter-well transmissivity and storativity using a conventional type-curve analysis. While the applied solution relies on a number of general assumptions, it has been found that reasonable comparison can be made to previously completed pulse interference and pumping tests. Results of this research indicate areas where method refinement is necessary, but, nonetheless, highlight the potential for use in crystalline bedrock environments. This method may provide value to future site characterization efforts given that it is complementary to, and can be used in conjunction with, other currently employed borehole liner applications, such as the removal of cross-connection at contaminated sites and the assessment of discrete fracture distributions when boreholes are sealed, recreating natural hydraulic gradient conditions.

AB Elevated nitrate in shallow aquifers is common in agricultural' areas and remediation requires an understanding of nitrogen (N) leaching at a variety of spatial scales. Characterization of the drivers of nitrate leaching at the mesoscale level (10(2)-10(3) km(2)) is needed to bridge from field-scale observations to the landscape-scale context, allowing informed water resource management decisions. Here we explore patterns in nitrate leaching rates across a depositional landform in the northern Great Plains within the Upper Missouri Basin, where the predominant land use is non-irrigated small grain production, and nitrate-N concentrations above 10 mg L-1 are common. The shallow Moccasin terrace (260 km(2)) aquifer is bounded in vertical extent by underlying shale and is isolated from mountain front stream recharge, such that aquifer recharge is dominated by infiltration of precipitation through agricultural soils. This configuration presents a simple landform-scale water balance that we leveraged to estimate leaching rates using groundwater nitrate concentrations and surface water discharge, and quantify uncertainty using a Monte Carlo approach based on spatial variation in observations of groundwater nitrate concentrations. A participatory research approach allowed local farmer knowledge of the landscape to be incorporated into the study design, improved selection of and access to sample sites, and enhanced prospects for addressing nitrate leaching through collaborative understanding of system hydrology. Mean landform-scale nitrate-N leaching rates were 11 and 18 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) during the 2012-2014 study for the two largest catchments draining the terrace. Over a standard three-year crop rotation, these leaching rates represent 19-31% of typical fertilizer N application rates; however, leaching losses are likely derived not only from fertilizer but also from soil organic N mineralization, and are apparently higher during the post-fallow phase of the crop rotation. Groundwater apparent age is relatively young (0-5 yr) based on tritium-helium analysis, but whole-aquifer turnover time calculations are an order of magnitude longer (20-23 yr), suggesting changes in groundwater may lag behind changes in land management by years to decades.

AB Reconstruction of missing runoff data is of important significance to solve contradictions between the common situation of gaps and the fundamental necessity of complete time series for reliable hydrological research. The conventional empirical orthogonal functions (EOF) approach has been documented to be useful for interpolating hydrological series based upon spatiotemporal decomposition of runoff variation patterns, without additional measurements (e.g., precipitation, land cover). This study develops a new EOF-based approach (abbreviated as CEOF) that conditions EOF expansion on the oscillations at outlet (or any other reference station) of a target basin and creates a set of residual series by removing the dependence on this reference series, in order to redefine the amplitude functions (components). This development allows a transparent hydrological interpretation of the dimensionless components and thereby strengthens their capacities to explain various runoff regimes in a basin. The two approaches are demonstrated on an application of discharge observations from the Ganjiang basin, China. Two alternatives for determining amplitude functions based on centred and standardised series, respectively, are tested. The convergence in the reconstruction of observations at different sites as a function of the number of components and its relation to the characteristics of the site are analysed. Results indicate that the CEOF approach offers an efficient way to restore runoff records with only one to four components; it shows more superiority in nested large basins than at headwater sites and often performs better than the EOF approach when using standardised series, especially in improving infilling accuracy for low flows. Comparisons against other interpolation methods (i.e., nearest neighbour, linear regression, inverse distance weighting) further confirm the advantage of the EOF-based approaches in avoiding spatial and temporal inconsistencies in estimated series.

AB The relationship between climate indices with Australian river streamflow (ASF) may provide valuable information for long-lead streamflow forecasting for Australian rivers. The current study examines the correlations between three climate indices (SST, 500 mb meridional wind -U-500 and 500 mb geopotential height-Z(500)) and 135 unimpaired ASF gauges for 1971-2011 using the singular value decomposition (SVD) method. First, SVD method was applied to check the SST-ASF correlated regions of influence and then extended SST-ASF variabilities were used to determine the correlated regions within Z(500) and U-500 fields. Based on the teleconnection, the most correlated region (150 degrees E to 105 degrees W and 35 degrees S to 5 degrees N) was identified and its persistency was checked by lag analysis up to 2 years from seasonal to yearly time-scale. The results displayed positive correlation for the south and south-eastern part of Australia while negative correlation prevails in the north-eastern region (at 95% significance level). The most correlated region was found situated along the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ) axis which may be considered as a probable climate driver for ASF. The persistency of this region was checked by a separate climate indicator (mean vertical velocity-500 mb) and found prominent in dry period than the wet period. This persistent teleconnected region may be potentially useful for long-lead forecasting of ASF. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Although past work has noted that contrasts in turbidity often are detectable on remotely sensed images of rivers downstream from confluences, no systematic methodology has been developed for assessing mixing over distance of confluent flows with differing surficial suspended sediment concentrations (SSSC). In contrast to field measurements of mixing below confluences, satellite remote-sensing can provide detailed information on spatial distributions of SSSC over long distances. This paper presents a methodology that uses remote-sensing data to estimate spatial patterns of SSSC downstream of confluences along large rivers and to determine changes in the amount of mixing over distance from confluences. The method develops a calibrated Random Forest (RF) model by relating training SSSC data from river gaging stations to derived spectral indices for the pixels corresponding to gaging-station locations. The calibrated model is then used to predict SSSC values for every river pixel in a remotely sensed image, which provides the basis for mapping of spatial variability in SSSCs along the river. The pixel data are used to estimate average surficial values of SSSC at cross sections spaced uniformly along the river. Based on the cross-section data, a mixing metric is computed for each cross section. The spatial pattern of change in this metric over distance can be used to define rates and length scales of surficial mixing of suspended sediment downstream of a confluence. This type of information is useful for exploring the potential influence of various controlling factors on mixing downstream of confluences, for evaluating how mixing in a river system varies over time and space, and for determining how these variations influence water quality and ecological conditions along the river.

ID MANAGEMENT; MODEL
AB Long records of continuous drain flow are important for quantifying annual and seasonal changes in the subsurface drainage flow from drained agricultural land. Missing data due to equipment malfunction and other challenges have limited conclusions that can be made about annual flow and thus nutrient loads from field studies, including assessments of the effect of controlled drainage. Water table depth data may be available during gaps in flow data, providing a basis for filling missing drain flow data; therefore, the overall goal of this study was to examine the potential to estimate drain flow using water table observations. The objectives were to evaluate how the shape of the relationship between drain flow and water table height above drain varies depending on the soil hydraulic conductivity profile, to quantify how well the Hooghoudt equation represented the water table-drain flow relationship in five years of measured data at the Davis Purdue Agricultural Center (DPAC), and to determine the impact of controlled drainage on drain flow using the filled dataset. The shape of the drain flow-water table height relationship was found to depend on the selected hydraulic conductivity profile. Estimated drain flow using the Hooghoudt equation with measured water table height for both free draining and controlled periods compared well to observed flow with Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency values above 0.7 and 0.8 for calibration and validation periods, respectively. Using this method, together with linear regression for the remaining gaps, a long-term drain flow record for a controlled drainage experiment at the DPAC was used to evaluate the impacts of controlled drainage on drain flow. In the controlled drainage sites, annual flow was 14-49% lower than free drainage. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Several large-scale field campaigns have been conducted over the last 20 years that require accurate measurements of soil moisture conditions. These measurements are manually conducted using soil moisture probes which require calibration. The calibration process involves the collection of hundreds of soil moisture cores, which is extremely labor intensive. In 2012, a field campaign was conducted in southern Manitoba in which 55 fields were sampled and calibration equations were derived for each field. The Soil Moisture Active Passive Experiment 2016 (SMAPVEX16) was conducted in this same region, and 21 of the same fields were resampled. This study examines the temporal transferability of calibration equations between these two field campaigns. It was found that the larger range in soil moisture over which samples were collected in 2012 (average range 0.11-0.41 m(3) m(-3)) generally resulted in lower errors when used in 2016 (average range 0.24-0.44 m(3) m(-3)) than the equations derived in 2016 when used with data collected in 2012. Combining the data collected in 2012 and 2016 did not improve the errors, overall. These results suggest that the transfer of calibration equations from one year to the next is not recommended.

AB The magnitude and frequency of hydrometeorological extremes are expected to increase in the conterminous United States (CONUS) over the rest of this century, and their increase will significantly impact water resource management. In this study, we evaluated the large-scale climate change effects on extreme hydrological events and their implications for reservoir inflows in 138 headwater subbasins located upstream of reservoirs across CONUS using the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrologic model. The VIC model was forced with a 10-member ensemble of global circulation models under the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 that were dynamically downscaled using a regional climate model (RegCM4) and bias-corrected to 1/24 degrees grid cell resolution. Four commonly used indices, including mean annual flow, annual center timing, 100-year daily high streamflow, and 10-year 7-day average low streamflow were used for evaluation. The results projected an increase in the high streamflow by 44% for a majority of subbasins upstream of flood control reservoirs in the central United States (US) and a decrease in the low streamflow by 11% for subbasins upstream of hydropower reservoirs across the western US. In the eastern US, frequencies of both high and low streamflow were projected to increase in the majority of subbasins upstream of both hydropower and flood control reservoirs. Increased frequencies of both high and low streamflow events can potentially make reservoirs across CONUS more vulnerable to future climate conditions. This study estimates reservoir inflow changes over the next several decades, which can be used to optimize water supply management downstream. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The activation of available in-sewer storage volume has been suggested as a low-cost flood and combined sewer overflow mitigation measure. However, it is currently unknown what the attributes for suitable objective functions to identify the best location for flow control devices are and the impact of those attributes on the results. In this study, we present a novel location model and efficient algorithm to identify the best location(s) to install flow limiters. The model is a screening tool that does not require hydraulic simulations but rather considers steady state instead of simplistic static flow conditions. It also maximises in-sewer storage according to different reward functions that also considers the potential impact of flow control device failure. We demonstrate its usefulness on two real sewer networks, for which an in sewer storage potential of approximately 2,000 m(3) and 500 m(3) was estimated with five flow control devices installed.

AB An inexact nonlinear m(lambda)-measure fuzzy chance-constrained programming (INMFCCP) model is developed for irrigation water allocation under uncertainty. Techniques of inexact quadratic programming (IQP), m(lambda)-measure, and fuzzy chance-constrained programming (FCCP) are integrated into a general optimization framework. The INMFCCP model can deal with not only nonlinearities in the objective function, but also uncertainties presented as discrete intervals in the objective function, variables and left-hand side constraints and fuzziness in the right-hand side constraints. Moreover, this model improves upon the conventional fuzzy chance-constrained programming by introducing a linear combination of possibility measure and necessity measure with varying preference parameters. To demonstrate its applicability, the model is then applied to a case study in the middle reaches of Heihe River Basin, northwest China. An interval regression analysis method is used to obtain interval crop water production functions in the whole growth period under uncertainty. Therefore, more flexible solutions can be generated for optimal irrigation water allocation. The variation of results can be examined by giving different confidence levels and preference parameters. Besides, it can reflect interrelationships among system benefits, preference parameters, confidence levels and the corresponding risk levels. Comparison between interval crop water production functions and deterministic ones based on the developed INMFCCP model indicates that the former is capable of reflecting more complexities and uncertainties in practical application. These results can provide more reliable scientific basis for supporting irrigation water management in arid areas. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID ADVECTION-DIFFUSION; SHALLOW-WATER; EQUATION
AB A lattice Boltzmann model of advection dispersion problems in one-dimensional (1D) open channel flows is developed for simulation of solute transport and pollutant concentration. The hydrodynamics are calculated based on a previous lattice Boltzmann approach to solving the 1D Saint-Venant equations (LABSVE). The advection dispersion model is coupled with the LABSVE using the lattice Boltzmann method. Our research recovers the advection dispersion equations through the Chapman-Enskog expansion of the lattice Boltzmann equation. The model differs from the existing schemes in two points: (1) the lattice Boltzmann numerical method is adopted to solve the advection dispersion problem by meso-scopic particle distribution; (2) and the model describes the relation between discharge, cross section area and solute concentration, which increases the applicability of the water quality model in practical engineering. The model is verified using three benchmark tests: (1) instantaneous solute transport within a short distance; (2) 1D point source pollution with constant velocity; (3) 1D point source pollution in a dam break flow. The model is then applied to a 50-year flood point source pollution accident on the Yongding River, which showed good agreement with a MIKE 11 solution and gauging data. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB The concentration of atmospheric tracers in groundwater samples collected from springs and deep wells is, in most cases, the result of a mixture of waters with a wide range of residence times in the ground. Such is the case of an unconfined aquifer recharged over all its surface area. Concentrations greatly differ from the homogeneous residence time case. Data interpretation relies on knowledge of the groundwater flow pattern. To study relatively large systems, the conservative ion chloride and the decaying radiocarbon (C-14) are considered. Radiocarbon (C-14) activity in groundwater, after correction to discount the nonbiogenic contribution, is often taken as an indication of water age, while chloride can be used to quantify recharge. In both cases, the observed tracer content in groundwater is an average value over a wide range which is related to water renewal time in the ground. This is shown considering an unconfined aquifer recharged all over its area under arid conditions, in which a period of greater recharge happened some millennia ago. The mathematical solution is given. As the solution cannot be made general, to show and discuss the changes in water reserve and in chloride and radiocarbon concentration (apparent ages), two scenarios are worked out, which are loosely related to current conditions in Northern Chile. It is shown that tracer concentration and the estimated water age are not directly related to the time since recharge took place. The existence of a previous wetter-than-present period has an important and lasting effect on current aquifer water reserves and chloride concentration, although the effect on radiocarbon activity is less pronounced. Chloride concentrations are smaller than in current recharge and apparent C-14 ages do not coincide with the timing, duration and characteristics of the wet period, except in the case in which recharge before and after the wet period is negligible and dead aquifer reserves are nonsignificant. The use of chloride concentration in springs as a proxy of chloride concentration in recharge to estimate recharge from atmospheric deposition leads to recharge value larger than the real one and it approaches the wet period recharge. Drawing inferences about radiocarbon data and recharge by the chloride balance method has rarely been taken into account before. It is important to consider the variable aquifer groundwater reserve. Current recharge estimation can be improved by careful selection of groundwater samples, supported by tritium and radiocarbon measurements. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The flow dimension parameter n, derived from the Generalized Radial Flow model, is a valuable tool to investigate the actual flow regimes that really occur during a pumping test rather than suppose them to be radial, as postulated by the Theis-derived models. A numerical approach has shown that, when the flow dimension is not radial, using the derivative analysis rather than the conventional Theis and Cooper-Jacob methods helps to estimate much more accurately the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer. Although n has been analysed in numerous studies including field-based studies, there is a striking lack of knowledge about its occurrence in nature and how it may be related to the hydrogeological setting. This study provides an overview of the occurrence of n in natural aquifers located in various geological contexts including crystalline rock, carbonate rock and granular aquifers. A comprehensive database is compiled from governmental and industrial sources, based on 69 constant-rate pumping tests. By means of a sequential analysis approach, we systematically performed a flow dimension analysis in which straight segments on drawdown-log derivative time series are interpreted as successive, specific and independent flow regimes. To reduce the uncertainties inherent in the identification of n sequences, we used the proprietary SIREN code to execute a dual simultaneous fit on both the drawdown and the drawdown-log derivative signals. Using the stated database, we investigate the frequency with which the radial and non-radial flow regimes occur in fractured rock and granular aquifers, and also provide outcomes that indicate the lack of applicability of Theis-derived models in representing nature. The results also emphasize the complexity of hydraulic signatures observed in nature by pointing out n sequential signals and non-integer n values that are frequently observed in the database.

AB Acid rain has the potential to significantly impact the quantity and quality of dissolved organic matter (DOM) leached from soil to groundwater. Yet, to date, the effects of acid rain have not been investigated in karstic systems, which are expected to strongly buffer the pH of atmospheric rainfall. This study presents a nine-year DOM fluorescence dataset from a karst unsaturated zone collected from two drip sites (HS4, HS6) in Heshang Cave, southern China between 2005 and 2014. Cross-correlograms show that fluorescence intensity of both dripwaters lagged behind rainfall by similar to 1 year (similar to 11 months lag for HS4, and similar to 13 months for HS6), whereas drip rates responded quite quickly to rainfall (0 months lag for HS4, and similar to 3 months for HS6), based on optimal correlation coefficients. The rapid response of drip rates to rainfall is related to the change of reservoir head pressure in summer, associated with higher rainfall. In winter, low rainfall has a limited effect on head pressure, and drip rates gradually slow to a constant value associated with base flow from the overlying reservoir- this effect being most evident on inter annual timescales (R-2 = 0.80 for HS4 and R-2 = 0.86 for HS6, n = 9, p < 0.01). We ascribed the 1 year lag of fluorescence intensity to the effect of the soil moisture deficit and the karst process on delaying water and solute transport. After eliminating the one year lag, the congruent seasonal pacing and amplitude between fluorescence intensity and rainfall observed suggests that the seasonality of fluorescence intensity was mainly controlled by the monsoonal rains which can govern the output of DOM from the soil, as well as the residence time of water in the unsaturated zone. On inter-annual timescales, a robust linear relationship between fluorescence intensity and annual (effective) precipitation amount (R-2 = 0.86 for HS4 and R-2 = 0.77 for HS6, n = 9, p < 0.01) was identified, implying that annual (effective) precipitation is the main determinant of DOM concentration in the aquifer. Conversely, the insensitivity of fluorescence intensity and fluorescence wavelength maxima to variations in the pH of local rainfall suggests that acid rain over the study period (pH 5.6 to 4.5) had no discernable effect on the quantity and quality of DOM in karst soil and soil solution, likely being strongly buffered by soil carbonates. Therefore, despite large increases in anthropogenic acid rain in recent Chinese history, hydrologic forcing is the predominant factor driving variations in DOM in karst aquifers.

AB The world's aquatic ecosystems, yield numerous vital services, which are essential to human existence but have deteriorated seriously in recent years. By studying the mechanisms of interaction between ecosystems and habitat processes, the constraining factors can be identified, and this knowledge can be used to improve the success rate of ecological restoration initiatives. At present, there is insufficient data on the link between hydrological, water quality factors and the changes in the structure of aquatic communities to allow any meaningful study of driving factors of aquatic ecosystems. In this study, the typical monitoring stations were selected by fuzzy clustering analysis based on the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of water ecology in Jinan City, the first pilot city for the construction of civilized aquatic ecosystems in China. The dominant species identification model was used to identify the dominant species of the aquatic community. The driving effect of hydrological and water quality factors on dominant species was analyzed by Canonical Correspondence Analysis. Then, the principal factors of aquatic ecosystem dependence were selected. The results showed that there were 10 typical monitoring stations out of 59 monitoring sites, which were representative of aquatic ecosystems, 9 dominant fish species, and 20 dominant invertebrate species. The selection of factors for aquatic ecosystem dependence in Jinan were highly influenced by its regional conditions. Chemical environmental parameters influence the temporal and spatial variation of invertebrate much more than that of fish in Jinan City. However, the methodologies coupling typical monitoring stations selection, dominant species determination and driving factors identification were certified to be a cost-effective way, which can provide in-deep theoretical and technical directions for the restoration of aquatic ecosystems elsewhere.

AB Despite precipitation intensities may greatly vary during one flood event, detailed information about these intensities may not be required to accurately simulate floods with a hydrological model which rather reacts to cumulative precipitation sums. This raises two questions: to which extent is it important to preserve sub-daily precipitation intensities and how long does it effectively rain from the hydrological point of view? Both questions might seem straightforward to answer with a direct analysis of past precipitation events but require some arbitrary choices regarding the length of a precipitation event. To avoid these arbitrary decisions, here we present an alternative approach to characterize the effective length of precipitation event which is based on runoff simulations with respect to large floods. More precisely, we quantify the fraction of a day over which the daily precipitation has to be distributed to faithfully reproduce the large annual and seasonal floods which were generated by the hourly precipitation rate time series. New precipitation time series were generated by first aggregating the hourly observed data into daily totals and then evenly distributing them over sub-daily periods (n hours). These simulated time series were used as input to a hydrological bucket-type model and the resulting runoff flood peaks were compared to those obtained when using the original precipitation time series. We define then the effective daily precipitation duration as the number of hours n, for which the largest peaks are simulated best. For nine mesoscale Swiss catchments this effective daily.precipitation duration was about half a day, which indicates that detailed information on precipitation intensities is not necessarily required to accurately estimate peaks of the largest annual and seasonal floods. These findings support the use of simple disaggregation approaches to make usage of past daily precipitation observations or daily precipitation simulations (e.g. from climate models) for hydrological modeling at an hourly time step.

AB The objective of this study is to compare two new generation low-complexity tools, AutoRoute and Height Above the Nearest Drainage (HAND), with a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model (Hydrologic Engineering Center-River Analysis System, HEC-RAS 2D). The assessment was conducted on two hydrologically different and geographically distant test-cases in the United States, including the 16,900 km2 Cedar River (CR) watershed in Iowa and a 62 km2 domain along the Black Warrior River (BWR) in Alabama. For BWR, twelve different configurations were set up for each of the models, including four different terrain setups (e.g. with and without channel bathymetry and a levee), and three flooding conditions representing moderate to extreme hazards at 10-, 100-, and 500-year return periods. For the CR watershed, models were compared with a simplistic terrain setup (without bathymetry and any form of hydraulic controls) and one flooding condition (100-year return period). Input streamfiow forcing data representing these hypothetical events were constructed by applying a new fusion approach on National Water Model outputs. Simulated inundation extent and depth from AutoRoute, HAND, and HEC-RAS 2D were compared with one another and with the corresponding FEMA reference estimates. Irrespective of the configurations, the low-complexity models were able to produce inundation extents similar to HECRAS 2D, with AutoRoute showing slightly higher accuracy than the HAND model. Among four terrain setups, the one including both levee and channel bathymetry showed lowest fitness score on the spatial agreement of inundation extent, due to the weak physical representation of low-complexity models compared to a hydrodynamic model. For inundation depth, the low-complexity models showed an overestimating tendency, especially in the deeper segments of the channel. Based on such reasonably good prediction skills, low-complexity flood models can be considered as a suitable alternative for fast predictions in large-scale hyper-resolution operational frameworks, without completely overriding hydrodynamic models' efficacy.

AB In regional flood frequency analysis the homogeneity of a group of stations is an essential assumption. A standard procedure in hydrology to evaluate this condition is the homogeneity measure of Hosking and Wallis, which applies L-moments. Disadvantages of it are the lack of power when analysing highly skewed data and the implicit assumption of spatial independence. To face these issues we generalize this procedure in two ways. Copulas are applied to model intersite dependence and trimmed L-moments as a more robust alternative to ordinary L-moments. The results of simulation studies are presented to discuss the influence of different copula models and different trimming parameters. The usage of asymmetrically trimmed L-moments improves the heterogeneity detection in skewed data. Simple copula models are sufficient to incorporate the dependence structure of the data in the procedure. Additionally, a more robust behaviour against extreme events at single stations is achieved with the use of trimmed L moments. Strong intersite dependence and skewed data reveal the need of a modified procedure in a case study with data from Saxony, Germany. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The availability of reliable water supplies is a key factor limiting development in northern Australia. However, characterising groundwater resources in this remote part of Australia is challenging due to a lack of existing infrastructure and data. Here, direct push technology (DPT) was used to characterise shallow alluvial aquifers at two locations in the semiarid Flinders River catchment. DPT was used to evaluate the saturated thickness of the aquifer and estimate recharge rates by sampling for environmental tracers in groundwater (major ions, H-2, O-18, H-3 and C-14). The alluvium at Fifteen Mile Reserve and Glendalough Station consisted of a mixture of permeable coarse sandy and gravely sediments and less permeable clays and silts. The alluvium was relatively thin (i.e. < 20 m) and, at the time of the investigation, was only partially saturated. Tritium (H-3) concentrations in groundwater was similar to 1 Tritium Unit (TU), corresponding to a mean residence time for groundwater of about 12 years. The lack of an evaporation signal for the 2H and O-18 of groundwater suggests rapid localised recharge from overbank flood events as the primary recharge mechanism. Using the chloride mass balance technique (CMB) and lumped parameter models to interpret patterns in 3H in the aquifer, the mean annual recharge rate varied between 21 and 240 mm/yr. Whilst this recharge rate is relatively high for a semiarid climate, the alluvium is thin and heterogeneous hosting numerous alluvial aquifers with varied connectivity and limited storage capacity. Combining DPT and environmental tracers is a cost-effective strategy to characterise shallow groundwater resources in unconsolidated sedimentary aquifers in remote data sparse areas.

AB Diffuse nitrate losses from agricultural land pollute groundwater resources worldwide, but can be attenuated under reducing subsurface conditions. In New Zealand, the ability to predict where groundwater denitrification occurs is important for understanding the linkage between land use and discharges of nitrate-bearing groundwater to streams. This study assesses the application of linear discriminant analysis (LDA) for predicting groundwater redox status for Southland, a major dairy farming region in New Zealand. Data cases were developed by assigning a redox status to samples derived from a regional groundwater quality database. Pre-existing regional-scale geospatial databases were used as training variables for the discriminant functions. The predictive accuracy of the discriminant functions was slightly improved by optimising the thresholds between sample depth classes. The models predict 23% of the region as being reducing at shallow depths (<15 m), and 37% at medium depths (15-75 m). Predictions were made at a sub-regional level to determine whether improvements could be made with discriminant functions trained by local data. The results indicated that any gains in predictive success were offset by loss of confidence in the predictions due to the reduction in the number of samples used.
   The regional scale model predictions indicate that subsurface reducing conditions predominate at low elevations on the coastal plains where poorly drained soils are widespread. Additional indicators for subsurface denitrification are a high carbon content of the soil, a shallow water table, and low-permeability clastic sediments. The coastal plains are an area of widespread groundwater discharge, and the soil and hydrology characteristics require the land to be artificially drained to render the land suitable for farming. For the improvement of water quality in coastal areas, it is therefore important that land and water management efforts focus on understanding hydrological bypassing that may occur via artificial drainage systems.

AB Hydraulic geometry (HG) has long enabled daily discharge estimates, flood risk monitoring, and water resource and habitat assessments, among other applications. At-many-stations HG (AMHG) is a newly discovered form of HG with an evolving understanding. AMHG holds that there are temporally and spatially invariant ('congruent') depth, width, velocity, and discharge values that are shared by all stations of a river. Furthermore, these river-wide congruent hydraulics have been shown to link at-a-station HG (AHG) in space, contrary to previous expectation of AHG as spatially unpredictable. To date, AMHG has only been thoroughly examined on six rivers, and its congruent hydraulics are not well understood. To address the limited understanding of AMHG, we calculated AMHG for 191 rivers in the United States using USGS field-measured data from over 1900 gauging stations. These rivers represent nearly all geologic and climatic settings found in the continental U.S. and allow for a robust assessment of AMHG across scales. Over 60% of rivers were found to have AMHG with strong explanatory power to predict AHG across space (defined as r(2) > 0.6, 118/191 rivers). We also found that derived congruent hydraulics bear little relation to their observed time-varying counterparts, and the strength of AMHG did not correlate with any available observed or congruent hydraulic parameters. We also found that AMHG is expressed at all fluvial scales in this study. Some statistically significant spatial clusters of rivers with strong and weak AMHG were identified, but further research is needed to identify why these clusters exist. Thus, this first widespread empirical investigation of AMHG leads us to conclude that AMHG is indeed a widely prevalent natural fluvial phenomenon, and we have identified linkages between known fluvial parameters and AMHG. Our work should give confidence to future researchers seeking to perform the necessary detailed hydraulic analysis of AMHG. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved,

AB Changes in long-term, montane actual evapotranspiration (ET) in response to climate change could impact future water supplies and forest species composition. For scenarios of atmospheric warming, predicted changes in long-term ET tend to differ between studies using space-for-time substitution (STS) models and integrated watershed models, and the influence of spatially varying factors on these differences is unclear. To examine this, we compared warming-induced (+2 to +6 degrees C) changes in ET simulated by an STS model and an integrated watershed model across zones of elevation, substrate available water capacity, and slope in the snow-influenced upper San Joaquin River watershed, Sierra Nevada, USA. We used the Soil Water and Assessment Tool (SWAT) for the watershed modeling and a Budyko-type relationship for the STS modeling. Spatially averaged increases in ET from the STS model increasingly surpassed those from the SWAT model in the higher elevation zones of the watershed, resulting in 2.3-2.6 times greater values from the STS model at the watershed scale. In sparse, deep colluvium or glacial soils on gentle slopes, the SWAT model produced ET increases exceeding those from the STS model. However, watershed areas associated with these conditions were too localized for SWAT to produce spatially averaged ET-gains comparable to the STS model. The SWAT model results nevertheless demonstrate that such soils on high-elevation, gentle slopes will form ET "hot spots" exhibiting disproportionately large increases in ET, and concomitant reductions in runoff yield, in response to warming. Predicted ET responses to warming from STS models and integrated watershed models may, in general, substantially differ (e.g., factor of 2-3) for snow-influenced watersheds exhibiting an elevational gradient in substrate water holding capacity and slope. Long-term water supplies in these settings may therefore be more resilient to warming than STS model predictions would suggest. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB During the winter and spring of 2000-2001, large floods occurred in northern France (Somme River Basin) and southern England (Patcham area of Brighton) in valleys that are developed on Chalk outcrops. The floods durations were particularly long (more than 3 months in the Somme Basin) and caused significant damage in both countries.
   To improve the understanding of groundwater flooding in Chalk catchments, an experimental site was set up in the Hallue basin, which is located in the Somme River Basin (France).
   Unsaturated fractured chalk formation overlying the Chalk aquifer was monitored to understand its reaction to long and heavy rainfall events when it reaches a near saturation state. The water content and soil temperature were monitored to a depth of 8 m, and the matrix pressure was monitored down to the water table, 26.5 m below ground level. The monitoring extended over a 2.5-year period (2006-2008) under natural conditions and during two periods when heavy, artificial infiltration was induced.
   The objective of the paper is to describe a vertical numerical flow model based on Richards' equation using these data that was developed to simulate infiltrating rainwater flow from the ground surface to the saturated aquifer. The MARTHE computer code, which models the unsaturated-saturated continuum, was adapted to reproduce the monitored high saturation periods. Composite constitutive functions (hydraulic conductivity-saturation and pressure-saturation) that integrate the increase in hydraulic conductivity near saturation and extra available porosity resulting from fractures were introduced into the code. Using these composite constitutive functions, the model was able to accurately simulate the water contents and pressures at all depths over the entire monitored period, including the infiltration tests. The soil temperature was also accurately simulated at all depths, except during the infiltrations tests, which contributes to the model validation. The model was used to calculate the aquifer recharge over a long period that included droughts and floods. The calculated recharge is realistic as it makes it possible to simulate the corresponding monitored groundwater level data, which increases confidence in the modelling approach.

AB Within hydrological models, flow approximations are commonly used to reduce computation time. The validity of these approximations is strongly determined by flow height, flow velocity and the spatial resolution of the model. In this presentation, the validity and performance of the kinematic, diffusive and dynamic flow approximations are investigated for use in a catchment-based flood model. Particularly, the validity during flood events and for varying spatial resolutions is investigated. The OpenLISEM hydrological model is extended to implement both these flow approximations and channel flooding based on dynamic flow. The flow approximations are used to recreate measured discharge in three catchments, among which is the hydrograph of the 2003 flood event in the Fella river basin. Furthermore, spatial resolutions are varied for the flood simulation in order to investigate the influence of spatial resolution on these flow approximations. Results show that the kinematic, diffusive and dynamic flow approximation provide least to highest accuracy, respectively, in recreating measured discharge. Kinematic flow, which is commonly used in hydrological modelling, substantially over-estimates hydrological connectivity in the simulations with a spatial resolution of below 30 m. Since spatial resolutions of models have strongly increased over the past decades, usage of routed kinematic flow should be reconsidered. The combination of diffusive or dynamic overland flow and dynamic channel flooding provides high accuracy in recreating the 2003 Fella river flood event. Finally, in the case of flood events, spatial modelling of kinematic flow substantially over-estimates hydrological connectivity and flow concentration since pressure forces are removed, leading to significant errors.

AB Watershed water resource allocation focuses on concrete aspects of the sustainable management of Ecosystem Services (ES) that are related to water and examines the possibility of implementing Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) for water ES. PES can be executed to satisfy both economic and environmental objectives and demands. Considering the importance of calculating PES schemes at the social equity and cooperative game (CG) levels, to quantitatively solve multi-objective problems, a water resources allocation model and multi-objective optimization are provided. The model consists of three modules that address the following processes: (1) social equity mechanisms used to study water consumer associations, (2) an optimal decision-making process based on variable intervals and CG theory, and (3) the use of Shapley values of CGs for profit maximization. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology for realizing sustainable development was examined. First, an optimization model with water allocation objective was developed based on sustainable water resources allocation framework that maximizes the net benefit of water use. Then, to meet water quality requirements, PES cost was estimated using trade-off curves among different pollution emission concentration permissions. Finally, to achieve equity and supply sufficient incentives for water resources protection, CG theory approaches were utilized to reallocate PES benefits. The potential of the developed model was examined by its application to a case study in the Yongding River watershed of China. Approximately 128 Me of water flowed from the upper reach (Shanxi and Hebei Provinces) sections of the Yongding River to the lower reach (Beijing) in 2013. According to the calculated results, Beijing should pay USD$6.31 M ((sic)39.03 M) for water-related ES to Shanxi and Hebei Provinces. The results reveal that the proposed methodology is an available tool that can be used for sustainable development with resolving PES amounts among different regions under social and environmental constraints by considering the characteristics of social equity and CGs.

AB Multiple barriers constrain the widespread application of participatory methods in water management, including the more technical focus of most water agencies, additional cost and time requirements for stakeholder involvement, as well as institutional structures that impede collaborative management. This paper presents a stepwise methodological framework that addresses the challenges of context sensitive initiation, design and institutionalization of participatory modeling processes. The methodological framework consists of five successive stages: (1) problem framing and stakeholder analysis, (2) process design, (3) individual modeling, (4) group model building, and (5) institutionalized participatory modeling. The Management and Transition Framework is used for problem diagnosis (Stage One), context-sensitive process design (Stage Two) and analysis of requirements for the institutionalization of participatory water management (Stage Five). Conceptual modeling is used to initiate participatory modeling processes (Stage Three) and ensure a high compatibility with quantitative modeling approaches (Stage Four). This paper describes the proposed participatory model building (PMB) framework and provides a case study of its application in Quebec, Canada. The results of the Quebec study demonstrate the applicability of the PMB framework for initiating and designing participatory model building processes and analyzing barriers towards institutionalization.

AB Some of the largest extents of naturally occurring acidic waters are found across southern Australia. The origins of these systems remain poorly understood with many hypotheses for their genesis. Australian government agency groundwater datasets and mapping data (vegetation, geology, regolith and soils) for south-western Australia, unavailable to previous researchers, were statistically analysed to better understand the origins of acidic groundwater and guide additional fieldwork to study the origins of acidic saline groundwater. The groundwater data showed a distinct bimodal distribution in pH; the 'acid' population had a median pH of 3.5 and the larger 'non-acid' population had a median pH of 6.6. Acidic groundwater became progressively more common further from the coast towards the drier internally drained regions. Acidic groundwater was mostly confined to the lower slopes and valley floors with localised controls on distribution. Paradoxically, subsoil alkalinity within the internally drained inland regions had the strongest correlation with acidic groundwater (r(2) = 0.85). Vegetation was also a strong predictor of acidic groundwater. Acidic groundwater had the highest occurrence under Eucalyptus woodlands and shrublands that grew on alkaline calcareous soils.
   Pre-clearing soil data in areas with acidic saline groundwater showed that the upper 1 m of the unsaturated zone had a pH around 8 while the pH at depths greater than 5 m decreased to <4. Based on the observations it is proposed that biogenic formation of calcareous soils occurs in the upper 1 m of the profile, calcium is sourced from the deeper profile where the root biota exchanges calcium for hydrogen ions to maintain charge balance. Iron is mobilised from the upper soil profile and concentrates lower in the profile at depths >1.5 m. There, the iron is reduced around roots and the alkalinity generated by microbial iron reduction is removed by biogenic calcification processes. The iron moves in solution further down the profile following roots where it comes in contact with the oxygenated unsaturated zone matrix and is oxidised generating acid. The resulting acidic recharging solution acidifies the unsaturated zone matrix. Saline groundwater moving through the matrix becomes acidified due to ion exchange or direct recharge. The main chemical processes were modelled in PHREEQC to test the plausibility of the hypothesis and acidic solutions with a pH of 3.8 or lower were obtained. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB The behavior of CO2 that coexists with CH4 and the effect of CH4 on the CO2 stream need to be deeply analyzed and studied, especially in the presence of water. Our previous studies investigated the breakthrough pressure and permeability of pure CO2 in five partially saturated low-permeability sandstone core samples from the Ordos Basin, and we concluded that rocks with a small pore size and low permeability show considerable sealing capacity even under unsaturated conditions. In this paper, we selected three of these samples for CO2-CH4 gas-mixture breakthrough experiments under various degrees of water saturation. The breakthrough experiments were performed by increasing the gas pressure step by step until breakthrough occurred. Then, the effluent gas mixture was collected for chromatographic partitioning analysis. The results indicate that CH4 significantly affects the breakthrough pressure and permeability of CO2. The presence of CH4 in the gas mixture increases the interfacial tension and, thus, the breakthrough pressure. Therefore, the injected gas mixture that contains the highest (lowest) mole fraction of CH4 results in the largest (smallest) breakthrough pressure. The permeability of the gas mixture is greater than that for pure CO2 because of CH4, and the effective permeability decreases with increased breakthrough pressure. Chromatographic partitioning of the effluent mixture gases indicates that CH4 breaks through ahead of CO2 as a result of its weaker solubility in water. Correlations are established between (1) the breakthrough pressure and water saturation, (2) the effective permeability and water saturation, (3) the breakthrough pressure and effective permeability, and (4) the mole fraction of CO2/CH4 in the effluent mixture gases and water saturation. These results deepen our understanding of the multi-phase flow behavior in the porous media under unsaturated conditions, which have implications for formulating emergency response plans for gas leakage into unsaturated zones. Finally, knowing the flow characteristic of gas mixture can guide CO2 storage, CO2-EOR and CO2-ECBM projects. Future studies should pay attention to the effects of saline water with different salt types and concentrations on the multi-phase flow behavior with applications to geological CO2 storage and energy storage using CH4.

AB A sound understanding of erosive processes at different scales can contribute substantially to the design of suitable management strategies. The main aim of this work was to evaluate key factors at the pedon scale that cause soil erosion to occur. To achieve this goal, we quantified infiltration, permeability, soil losses and runoff volumes in a small Southern Spanish catchment cultivated with olive orchards. To assess which factor contributed most to speeding up soil erosion, a Spearman rank coefficient and principal components analysis were carried out. The results confirmed low infiltration values (11.8 mm h(-1)) in the surface soil layers and high permeability values (24.6 mm h(-1)) in the sub-surface soil layers, and produced an average soil loss of 19.7 g m(-2) and average runoff coefficients of 26.1%. Statistical analyses showed that: i) the generation of runoff was closely correlated with soil loss; and, ii) an increase in the vegetation cover helped reduce soil erosion. In comparison to larger areas such as a catchment, the pedon scale produced lower or similar soil losses and runoff coefficients in rainfall simulation conditions, although the influence of vegetation cover as a control factor was also detected.

AB Increased concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) have been reported for many catchments across the northern hemisphere. Hypotheses to explain the increase have varied (eg. increasing air temperature or recovery from acidification) but one test of alternative hypotheses is the trend over the recent decade, with the competing hypotheses predicting: continuing increase; the rate of increase declining with time; and even decrease in concentration. In this study, records of DOC concentration in non tidal rivers across the UK were examined for the period 2003-2012. The study found that:
   i) Of the 62 decade-long concentration trends that could be examined, 3 showed a significant increase, 17 experienced no significant change and 42 showed a significant decrease; in 28 of the 42 significant decreases, a significant step change was apparent with step changes being a decrease in concentration in every case.
   ii) Of the 118 sites where annual flux and concentration records were available from 1974, 28 showed a significant step change down in flux and 52 showed a step down in concentration. The modal year of the step changes was 2000 with no step changes observed before 1982.
   iii) At the UK national scale, DOC flux peaked in 2005 at 1354 ktonnes C/yr (5.55 tonnes C/km(2)/yr) but has declined since.
   The study suggests that there is a disconnection between DOC records from large catchments at their tidal limits and complementary records from headwater catchments, which means that mechanisms believed to be driving increases in DOC concentrations in headwaters will not necessarily be those controlling trends in DOC concentration further downstream. We propose that the changes identified here have been driven by changes in in-stream processing and changes brought about by the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive. Therefore, signals identified in headwater catchments may bear little relation to those observed in large rivers much further downstream and vice versa. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Non-rainfall water (NRW, e.g. fog and dew), in addition to rainfall and snowfall, are considered important water inputs to drylands. At the same time, biological soil crusts (BSCs) are important components of dry lands. However, little information is available regarding the effect of NRW inputs on BSC activation. In this study, the effects of NRW on physiological activation in three BSC successional stages, including the cyanobacteria crust stage (Crust-C), moss colonization stage (Crust-CM), and moss crust stage (Crust-M), were studied in situ. Results suggest NRW inputs hydrated and activated physiological activity (F-v/F-m, carbon exchange, and nitrogen fixation) in BSCs but led to a negative carbon balance and low rates of nitrogen fixation in BSCs. One effective NRW event could hydrate BSCs for 7 h. Following simulated rainfall, the physiological activities recovered within 3 h, and net carbon gain occurred until 3 h after hydration, whereas NRW-induced physiological recovery processes were slower and exhibited lower activities, leading to a negative carbon balance. There were significant positive correlations between NRW amounts and the recovered values of F-v/F-m in all the three BSC stages (p < .001). The thresholds for F-v/F-m activation decreased with BSC succession, and the annual effective NRW events increased with BSC succession, with values of 29.8, 89.2, and 110.7 in Crust-C, Crust-CM and Crust-M, respectively. The results suggest that moss crust and moss-cyanobacteria crust use NRW to prolong metabolic activity and reduce drought stress more efficiently than cyanobacteria crusts. Therefore, these results suggest that BSCs utilize NRW to sustain life while growth and biomass accumulation require precipitation (rainfall) events over a certain threshold. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Classical understanding on basin-scale groundwater flow patterns is based on Toth's findings of a single flow system in a unit basin (Toth, 1962) and nested flow systems in a complex basin (Toth, 1963), both of which were based on steady state models. Vandenberg (1980) extended Toth (1962) by deriving a transient solution under a periodically changing water table in a unit basin and examined the flow field distortion under different dimensionless response time, tau*. Following Vandenberg's (1980) approach, we extended Toth (1963) by deriving the transient solution under a periodically changing water table in a complex basin and examined the transient behavior of nested flow systems. Due to the effect of specific storage, the flow field is asymmetric with respect to the midline, and the trajectory of internal stagnation points constitutes a non-enclosed loop, whose width decreases when tau* decreases. The distribution of the relative magnitude of hydraulic head fluctuation, Delta h*, is dependent on the horizontal distance away from a divide and the depth below the land surface. In the shallow part, Delta h* decreases from 1 at the divide to 0 at its neighboring valley under all tau*, while in the deep part, Delta h* reaches a threshold, whose value decreases when tau* increases. The zones with flowing wells are also found to change periodically. As water table falls, there is a general trend of shrinkage in the area of zones with flowing wells, which has a lag to the declining water table under a large tau*. Although fluxes have not been assigned in our model, the recharge/discharge flux across the top boundary can be obtained. This study is critical to understand a series of periodically changing hydrogeological phenomena in large-scale basins. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Rainfall is one of the most crucial processes in hydrology, and the direct and indirect rainfall measurement methods are constantly being updated and improved. The standard instrument used to measure rainfall rate and accumulation is the rain gauge, which provides direct observations. Though the small dimension of the orifice allows rain gauges to be installed anywhere, it also causes errors due to the splash and wind effects. To investigate the role of the orifice dimension, this study, for the first time, introduces and demonstrates an apparatus for observing rainfall called a giant-rain gauge that is characterised by a collecting surface of 100 m(2). To discuss the new instrument and its technical details, a preliminary analysis of 26 rainfall events is provided. The results suggest that there are significant differences between the standard and proposed rain gauges. Specifically, major discrepancies are evident for low time aggregation scale (5, 10, and 15 min) and for high rainfall intensity values. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We present the application of a parametric stochastic weather generator within a nonstationary context, enabling simulations of weather sequences conditioned on interannual and multi-decadal trends. The generalized linear model framework of the weather generator allows any number of covariates to be included, such as large-scale climate indices, local climate information, seasonal precipitation and temperature, among others. Here we focus on the Salado A basin of the Argentine Pampas as a case study, but the methodology is portable to any region. We include domain-averaged (e.g., areal) seasonal total precipitation and mean maximum and minimum temperatures as covariates for conditional simulation. Areal covariates are motivated by a principal component analysis that indicates the seasonal spatial average is the dominant mode of variability across the domain. We find this modification to be effective in capturing the nonstationarity prevalent in interseasonal precipitation and temperature data. We further illustrate the ability of this weather generator to act as a spatiotemporal downscaler of seasonal forecasts and multidecadal projections, both of which are generally of coarse resolution.

AB Rainfall time series of high temporal resolution and spatial density are crucial for urban hydrology. The multiplicative random cascade model can be used for temporal rainfall disaggregation of daily data to generate such time series. Here, the uniform splitting approach with a branching number of 3 in the first disaggregation step is applied. To achieve a final resolution of 5 min, subsequent steps after disaggregation are necessary. Three modifications at different disaggregation levels are tested in this investigation (uniform splitting at Delta t = 15 min, linear interpolation at Delta t = 7.5 min and Delta t = 3.75 min). Results are compared both with observations and an often used approach, based on the assumption that a time steps with Delta t = 5.625 min, as resulting if a branching number of 2 is applied throughout, can be replaced with Delta t = 5 min (called the 1280 min approach). Spatial consistence is implemented in the disaggregated time series using a resampling algorithm. In total, 24 recording stations in Lower Saxony, Northern Germany with a 5 min resolution have been used for the validation of the disaggregation procedure. The urban hydrological suitability is tested with an artificial combined sewer system of about 170 hectares.
   The results show that all three variations outperform the 1280 min approach regarding reproduction of wet spell duration, average intensity, fraction of dry intervals and lag-1 autocorrelation. Extreme values with durations of 5 min are also better represented. For durations of 1 h, all approaches show only slight deviations from the observed extremes.
   The applied resampling algorithm is capable to achieve sufficient spatial consistence. The effects on the urban hydrological simulations are significant. Without spatial consistence, flood volumes of manholes and combined sewer overflow are strongly underestimated. After resampling, results using disaggregated time series as input are in the range of those using observed time series.
   Best overall performance regarding rainfall statistics are obtained by the method in which the disaggregation process ends at time steps with 7.5 min duration, deriving the 5 min time steps by linear interpolation. With subsequent resampling this method leads to a good representation of manhole flooding and combined sewer overflow volume in terms of hydrological simulations and outperforms the 1280 min approach.

AB Long-range dependence (LRD), the so-called Hurst-Kolmogorov behaviour, is considered to be an intrinsic characteristic of most natural processes. This behaviour manifests itself by the prevalence of slowly decaying autocorrelation function and questions the Markov assumption, often habitually employed in time series analysis. Herein, we investigate the dependence structure of annual rainfall using a large set, comprising more than a thousand stations worldwide of length 100 years or more, as well as a smaller number of paleoclimatic reconstructions covering the last 12,000 years. Our findings suggest weak long-term persistence for instrumental data (average H = 0.59), which becomes stronger with scale, i.e. in the paleoclimatic reconstructions (average H = 0.75).

AB Addressing systematic biases in regional climate model simulations of extreme rainfall is a necessary first step before assessing changes in future rainfall extremes. Commonly used bias correction methods are designed to match statistics of the overall simulated rainfall with observations. This assumes that change in the mix of different types of extreme rainfall events (i.e. convective and non-convective) in a warmer climate is of little relevance in the estimation of overall change, an assumption that is not supported by empirical or physical evidence. This study proposes an alternative approach to account for the potential change of alternate rainfall types, characterized here by synoptic weather patterns (SPs) using self organizing maps classification. The objective of this study is to evaluate the added influence of SPs on the bias correction, which is achieved by comparing the corrected distribution of future extreme rainfall with that using conventional quantile mapping. A comprehensive synthetic experiment is first defined to investigate the conditions under which the additional information of SPs makes a significant difference to the bias correction. Using over 600,000 synthetic cases, statistically significant differences are found to be present in 46% cases. This is followed by a case study over the Sydney region using a high-resolution run of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) regional climate model, which indicates a small change in the proportions of the SPs and a statistically significant change in the extreme rainfall over the region, although the differences between the changes obtained from the two bias correction methods are not statistically significant.

DE Precipitation variability; Precipitation correction; High Alpine area;
   Conceptual rainfall-runoff model
ID RUNOFF; PERFORMANCE; MODEL
AB This contribution presents a method for correcting the spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation fields in a mountainous environment. The approach is applied within a flood forecasting model in the Upper Enns catchment in the Central Austrian Alps.
   Precipitation exhibits a large spatio-temporal variability in Alpine areas. Additionally the density of the monitoring network is low and measurements are subjected to major errors. This can lead to significant deficits in water balance estimation and stream flow simulations, e.g. for flood forecasting models. Therefore precipitation correction factors are frequently applied.
   For the presented study a multiplicative, stepwise linear correction model is implemented in the rainfall-runoff model COSERO to adjust the precipitation pattern as a function of elevation. To account for the local meteorological conditions, the correction model is derived for two elevation zones: (1) Valley floors to 2000 m a.s.l. and (2) above 2000 m a.s.l. to mountain peaks. Measurement errors also depend on the precipitation type, with higher magnitudes in winter months during snow fall. Therefore, additionally, separate correction factors for winter and summer months are estimated. Significant improvements in the runoff simulations could be achieved, not only in the long-term water balance simulation and the overall model performance, but also in the simulation of flood peaks.

AB In order to resolve contradictions in addressing a soil moisture-precipitation feedback mechanism over West Africa and to clarify the impact of antecedent soil moisture on subsequent rainfall evolution, we first validated various data sets (SMOS satellite soil moisture observations, NOAH land surface model, TRMM rainfall, CMORPH rainfall and HadGEM climate models) with the Analyses Multidisciplinaires de la Mousson Africaine (AMMA) field campaign data. Based on this analysis, it was suggested that biases of data sets might cause contradictions in studying mechanisms. Thus, by taking into account uncertainties in data, it was found that the approach of consecutive dry days (i.e. a relative comparison of time-series) showed consistency across various data sets, while the direct comparison approach for soil moisture state and rainfall did not. Thus, it was discussed that it may be difficult to directly relate rain with soil moisture as the absolute value, however, it may be reasonable to compare a temporal progress of the variables. Based upon the results consistently showing a positive relationship between the consecutive dry days and rainfall, this study supports a negative feedback often neglected by climate model structure. This approach is less sensitive to interpretation errors arising from systematic errors in data sets, as this measures a temporal gradient of soil moisture state. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB We present an approach for evaluating catchment-scale hydro-meteorological impacts of projected climate change based on the atmospheric circulation patterns (ACPs) of a region. Our approach is motivated by the conjecture that GCMs are especially good at simulating the atmospheric circulation patterns that control moisture transport, and which can be expected to change in response to global warming. In support of this, we show (for the late 20th century) that GCMs provide much better simulations of ACPs than those of precipitation amount for the Upper Guadiana Basin in central Spain. For the same period, four of the twenty GCMs participating in the most recent (5th) IPCC Assessment provide quite accurate representations of the spatial patterns of mean sea level pressure, the frequency distribution of ACP type, the 'number of rainy days per month', and the daily 'probability of rain' (they also reproduce the trend of 'wet day amount', though not the actual magnitudes). A consequent analysis of projected trends and changes in hydro-climatic ACPology between the late 20th and 21st Centuries indicates that (1) actual changes appear to be occurring faster than predicted by the models, and (2) for two greenhouse gas emission scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) the expected decline in precipitation volume is associated mainly with a few specific ACPs (primarily directional flows from the Atlantic Ocean and Cantabric Sea), and with decreasing probability of rain (linked to increasing temperatures) rather than wet day amount. Our approach is a potentially more insightful alternative for catchment-scale climate impacts assessments than the common approach of statistical downscaling and bias correction.

AB Many hydrological applications, such as flood studies, require the use of long rainfall data at fine time scales varying from daily down to 1 min time step. However, in the real world there is limited availability of data at sub-hourly scales. To cope with this issue, stochastic disaggregation techniques are typically employed to produce possible, statistically consistent, rainfall events that aggregate up to the field data collected at coarser scales. A methodology for the stochastic disaggregation of rainfall at fine time scales was recently introduced, combining the Bartlett-Lewis process to generate rainfall events along with adjusting procedures to modify the lower-level variables (i.e., hourly) so as to be consistent with the higher-level one (i.e., daily). In the present paper, we extend the aforementioned scheme, initially designed and tested for the disaggregation of daily rainfall into hourly depths, for any sub-hourly time scale. In addition, we take advantage of the recent developments in Poisson-cluster processes incorporating in the methodology a Bartlett-Lewis model variant that introduces dependence between cell intensity and duration in order to capture the variability of rainfall at sub-hourly time scales. The disaggregation scheme is implemented in an R package, named HyetosMinute, to support disaggregation from daily down to 1-min time scale. The applicability of the methodology was assessed on a 5-min rainfall records collected in Bochum, Germany, comparing the performance of the above mentioned model variant against the original Bartlett-Lewis process (non-random with 5 parameters). The analysis shows that the disaggregation process reproduces adequately the most important statistical characteristics of rainfall at wide range of time scales, while the introduction of the model with dependent intensity-duration results in a better performance in terms of skewness, rainfall extremes and dry proportions.

AB Given uncertainty in precipitation gauge-based gridded datasets over complex terrain, we use multiple streamflow observations as an additional source of information about precipitation, in order to identify spatial and temporal differences between a gridded precipitation dataset and precipitation inferred from streamflow. We test whether gridded datasets capture across-crest and regional spatial patterns of variability, as well as year-to-year variability and trends in precipitation, in comparison to precipitation inferred from streamflow. We use a Bayesian model calibration routine with multiple lumped hydrologic model structures to infer the most likely basin-mean, water-year total precipitation for 56 basins with long-term (>30 year) streamflow records in the Sierra Nevada mountain range of California. We compare basin-mean precipitation derived from this approach with basin-mean precipitation from a precipitation gauge-based,1 /16 degrees gridded dataset that has been used to simulate and evaluate trends in Western United States streamflow and snowpack over the 20th century. We find that the long-term average spatial patterns differ: in particular, there is less precipitation in the gridded dataset in higher-elevation basins whose aspect faces prevailing cool-season winds, as compared to precipitation inferred from streamflow. In a few years and basins, there is less gridded precipitation than there is observed streamflow. Lower elevation, southern, and east-of-crest basins show better agreement between gridded and inferred precipitation. Implied actual evapotranspiration (calculated as precipitation minus streamflow) then also varies between the streamflow-based estimates and the gridded dataset. Absolute uncertainty in precipitation inferred from streamflow is substantial, but the signal of basin-to-basin and year-to-year differences are likely more robust. The findings suggest that considering streamflow when spatially distributing precipitation in complex terrain may improve its representation, particularly for basins whose orientations (e.g., windward-facing) are favored for orographic precipitation enhancement.

AB Precipitation constitutes a major contribution to the flow in urban storm-and wastewater systems. Forecasts of the anticipated runoff flows, created from radar extrapolation and/or numerical weather predictions, can potentially be used to optimize operation in both wet and dry weather periods. However, flow forecasts are inevitably uncertain and their use will ultimately require a trade-off between the value of knowing what will happen in the future and the probability and consequence of being wrong.
   In this study we examine how ensemble forecasts from the HIRLAM-DMI-S05 numerical weather prediction (NWP) model subject to three different ensemble post-processing approaches can be used to forecast flow exceedance in a combined sewer for a wide range of ratios between the probability of detection (POD) and the probability of false detection (POFD). We use a hydrological rainfall-runoff model to transform the forecasted rainfall into forecasted flow series and evaluate three different approaches to establishing the relative operating characteristics (ROC) diagram of the forecast, which is a plot of POD against POFD for each fraction of concordant ensemble members and can be used to select the weight of evidence that matches the desired trade-off between POD and POFD. In the first approach, the rainfall input to the model is calculated for each of 25 ensemble members as a weighted average of rainfall from the NWP cells over the catchment where the weights are proportional to the areal intersection between the catchment and the NWP cells. In the second approach, a total of 2825 flow ensembles are generated using rainfall input from the neighbouring NWP cells up to approximately 6 cells in all directions from the catchment. In the third approach, the first approach is extended spatially by successively increasing the area covered and for each spatial increase and each time step selecting only the cell with the highest intensity resulting in a total of 175 ensemble members. While the first and second approaches have the disadvantage of not covering the full range of the ROC diagram and being computationally heavy, respectively, the third approach leads to both a broad coverage of the ROC diagram range at a relatively low computational cost. A broad coverage of the ROC diagram offers a larger selection of prediction skill to choose from to best match to the prediction purpose.
   The study distinguishes itself from earlier research in being the first application to urban hydrology, with fast runoff and small catchments that are highly sensitive to local extremes. Furthermore, no earlier reference has been found on the highly efficient third approach using only neighbouring cells with the highest threat to expand the range of the ROC diagram. This study provides an efficient and robust approach to using ensemble rainfall forecasts affected by bias and misplacement errors for predicting flow threshold exceedance in urban drainage systems.

AB Atmospheric rivers (ARs) play a central role in the hydrology and hydroclimatology of the central United States. More than 25% of the annual rainfall is associated with ARs over much of this region, with many large flood events tied to their occurrence. Despite the relevance of these storms for flood hydrology and water budget, the characteristics of rainfall associated with ARs over the central United has not been investigated thus far. This study fills this major scientific gap by describing the rainfall during ARs over the central United States using five remote sensing-based precipitation products over a 12-year study period. The products we consider are: Stage IV, Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission - Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA, both real-time and research version); Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN); the CPC MORPHing Technique (CMORPH). As part of the study, we evaluate these products against a rain gauge-based dataset using both graphical- and metrics-based diagnostics. Based on our analyses, Stage IV is found to better reproduce the reference data. Hence, we use it for the characterization of rainfall in ARs.
   Most of the AR-rainfall is located in a narrow region within similar to 150 km on both sides of the AR major axis. In this region, rainfall has a pronounced positive relationship with the magnitude of the water vapor transport. Moreover, we have also identified a consistent increase in rainfall intensity with duration (or persistence) of AR conditions. However, there is not a strong indication of diurnal variability in AR rainfall. These results can be directly used in developing flood protection strategies during ARs. Further, weather prediction agencies can benefit from the results of this study to achieve higher skill of resolving precipitation processes in their models. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Impact of air temperature on the Maximum Precipitation (MP) estimation through change in moisture holding capacity of air was investigated. A series of previous studies have estimated the MP of 72-h basin-average precipitation over the American River watershed (ARW) in Northern California by means of the Maximum Precipitation (MP) estimation approach, which utilizes a physically-based regional atmospheric model. For the MP estimation, they have selected 61 severe storm events for the ARW, and have maximized them by means of the atmospheric boundary condition shifting (ABCS) and relative humidity maximization (RHM) methods. This study conducted two types of numerical experiments in addition to the MP estimation by the previous studies. First, the air temperature on the entire lateral boundaries of the outer model domain was increased uniformly by 0.0-8.0 degrees C with 0.5 degrees C increments for the two severest maximized historical storm events in addition to application of the ABCS + RHM method to investigate the sensitivity of the basin-average precipitation over the ARW to air temperature rise. In this investigation, a monotonous increase was found in the maximum 72-h basin-average precipitation over the ARW with air temperature rise for both of the storm events. The second numerical experiment used specific amounts of air temperature rise that is assumed to happen under future climate change conditions. Air temperature was increased by those specified amounts uniformly on the entire lateral boundaries in addition to application of the ABCS + RHM method to investigate the impact of air temperature on the MP estimate over the ARW under changing climate. The results in the second numerical experiment show that temperature increases in the future climate may amplify the MP estimate over the ARW. The MP estimate may increase by 14.6% in the middle of the 21st century and by 27.3% in the end of the 21st century compared to the historical period. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper has established a link between the spatial structure of radar rainfall, which more robustly describes the spatial structure, and gauge rainfall for improved daily rainfield simulation conditioned on the limited gauged data for regions with or without radar records. A two-dimensional anisotropic exponential function that has parameters of major and minor axes lengths, and direction, is used to describe the correlogram (spatial structure) of daily rainfall in the Gaussian domain. The link is a copula-based joint distribution of the radar-derived correlogram parameters that uses the gauge derived correlogram parameters and maximum daily temperature as covariates of the Box-Cox power exponential margins and Gumbel copula. While the gauge-derived, radar-derived and the copula derived correlogram parameters reproduced the mean estimates similarly using leave-one-out cross validation of ordinary kriging, the gauge-derived parameters yielded higher standard deviation (SD) of the Gaussian quantile which reflects uncertainty in over 90% of cases. However, the distribution of the SD generated by the radar-derived and the copula-derived parameters could not be distinguished. For the validation case, the percentage of cases of higher SD by the gauge-derived parameter sets decreased to 81.2% and 86.6% for the non-calibration and the calibration periods, respectively. It has been observed that 1% reduction in the Gaussian quantile SD can cause over 39% reduction in the SD of the median rainfall estimate, actual reduction being dependent on the distribution of rainfall of the day. Hence the main advantage of using the most correct radar correlogram parameters is to reduce the uncertainty associated with conditional simulations that rely on SD through kriging.

AB A new technique for merging radar precipitation estimates and rain gauge data is developed and evaluated to improve multisensor quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE), in particular, of heavy-to extreme precipitation. Unlike the conventional cokriging methods which are susceptible to conditional bias (CB), the proposed technique, referred to herein as conditional bias-penalized cokriging (CBPCK), explicitly minimizes Type-II CB for improved quantitative estimation of heavy-to-extreme precipitation. CBPCK is a bivariate version of extended conditional bias-penalized kriging (ECBPK) developed for gauge only analysis. To evaluate CBPCK, cross validation and visual examination are carried out using multi-year hourly radar and gauge data in the North Central Texas region in which CBPCK is compared with the variant of the ordinary cokriging (OCK) algorithm used operationally in the National Weather Service Multisensor Precipitation Estimator. The results show that CBPCK significantly reduces Type-II CB for estimation of heavy-to-extreme precipitation, and that the margin of improvement over OCK is larger in areas of higher fractional coverage (FC) of precipitation. When FC > 0.9 and hourly gauge precipitation is > 60 mm, the reduction in root mean squared error (RMSE) by CBPCK over radar-only (RO) is about 12 mm while the reduction in RMSE by OCK over RO is about 7 mm. CBPCK may be used in real-time analysis or in reanalysis of multisensor precipitation for which accurate estimation of heavy to-extreme precipitation is of particular importance.

AB Eight years of daily rainfall data from WegenerNet were analyzed by comparison with data from Austrian national weather stations. WegenerNet includes 153 ground level weather stations in an area of about 15 km x 20 km in the Feldbach region in southeast Austria. Rainfall has been measured by tipping bucket gauges at 150 stations of the network since the beginning of 2007. Since rain gauge measurements are considered close to true rainfall, there are increasing needs for WegenerNet data for the validation of rainfall data products such as remote sensing based estimates or model outputs. Serving these needs, this paper aims at providing a clearer interpretation on WegenerNet rainfall data for users in hydro meteorological communities.
   Five clusters - a cluster consists of one national weather station and its four closest WegenerNet stations - allowed us close comparison of datasets between the stations. Linear regression analysis and error estimation with statistical indices were conducted to quantitatively evaluate the WegenerNet daily rainfall data. It was found that rainfall data between the stations show good linear relationships with an average correlation coefficient (r) of 0.97, while WegenerNet sensors tend to underestimate rainfall according to the regression slope (0.87). For the five clusters investigated, the bias and relative bias were -0.97 mm d(-1) and -11.5% on average (except data from new sensors). The average of bias and relative bias, however, could be reduced by about 80% through a simple linear regression-slope correction, with the assumption that the underestimation in WegenerNet data was caused by systematic errors. The results from the study have been employed to improve WegenerNet data for user applications so that a new version of the data (v5) is now available at the WegenerNet data portal (www.wegenernet.org).

TI A comprehensive and systematic evaluation framework for a parsimonious

ID SPACE-TIME MODEL; STOCHASTIC GENERATION
AB The spatial distribution of rainfall has a significant influence on catchment dynamics and the generation of streamflow time series. However, there are few stochastic models that can simulate long sequences of stochastic rainfall fields continuously in time and space. To address this issue, the first goal of this study was to present a new parsimonious stochastic model that produces daily rainfall fields across the catchment. To achieve parsimony, the model used the latent-variable approach (because this parsimoniously simulates rainfall occurrences as well as amounts) and several other assumptions (including contemporaneous and separable spatiotemporal covariance structures). The second goal was to develop a comprehensive and systematic evaluation (CASE) framework to identify model strengths and weaknesses. This included quantitative performance categorisation that provided a systematic, succinct and transparent method to assess and summarise model performance over a range of statistics, sites, scales and seasons. The model is demonstrated using a case study from the Onkaparinga catchment in South Australia. The model showed many strengths in reproducing the observed rainfall characteristics with the majority of statistics classified as either statistically indistinguishable from the observed or within 5% of the observed across the majority of sites and seasons. These included rainfall occurrences/amounts, wet/dry spell distributions, annual volumes/extremes and spatial patterns, which are important from a hydrological perspective. One of the few weaknesses of the model was that the total annual rainfall in dry years (lower 5%) was overestimated by 15% on average over all sites. An advantage of the CASE framework was that it was able to identify the source of this overestimation was poor representation of the annual variability of rainfall occurrences. Given the strengths of this continuous daily rainfall field model it has a range of potential hydrological applications, including drought and flood risk. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   GAUGE DATA; REAL-TIME; REGION
AB Spatial rainfall data is an essential input to Distributed Hydrological Models (DHM), and a significant contributor to hydrological model uncertainty. Model uncertainty is higher when rain gauges are sparse, as is often the case in practice. Currently, satellite-based precipitation products increasingly provide an alternative means to ground-based rainfall estimates, in which case a rigorous product assessment is required before implementation. Accordingly, the twofold objective of this work paper was the real-world assessment of both (a) the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) rainfall product using gauge data, and (b) the TRMM product's role in forcing data for hydrologic simulations in the area of the Tiaoxi catchment (Taihu lake basin, China). The TRMM rainfall products used in this study are the Version-7 real-time 3B42RT and the post-real-time 3B42. It was found that the TRMM rainfall data showed a superior performance at the monthly and annual scales, fitting well with surface observation-based frequency rainfall distributions. The Nash-Sutcliffe Coefficient of Efficiency (NSCE) and the relative bias ratio (BIAS) were used to evaluate hydrologic model performance. The satisfactory performance of the monthly runoff simulations in the Tiaoxi study supports the view that the implementation of real-time 3B42RT allows considerable room for improvement. At the same time, post-real-time 3B42 can be a valuable tool of hydrologic modeling, water balance analysis, and basin water resource management, especially in developing countries or at remote locations in which rainfall gauges are scarce.

AB High-frequency components of precipitation variability have been an important focus of study during the last few decades in Chile. Low-frequency variations, on the other hand, have received less attention, especially in association with multi-decadal cycles that can affect variability trends of precipitation in the long term. This study analyzes these low-frequency patterns of precipitation in Chile (>30 years), and their relationship to global Sea Sulfate Temperatures (SSTs), with special focus on associations with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO) indices. Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) and its Multi-Channel version (MSSA) techniques were applied to a dataset containing long instrumental records of monthly precipitation aggregated yearly and seasonally. The relationships between the low-frequency variability of precipitation and the PDO are significant to the north of the country, whereas connections with the AMO are significant to the north and also to the south. This is also evident from the global spatial correlation analysis of low-frequency precipitation modes and SSTs, where the southernmost station shows a strong relationship with the Atlantic Ocean. We conclude that a significant multi-decadal precipitation cycle between 40 and 60 years is evident at the rain gauges located in the subtropical and extratropical regions of Chile. This low-frequency variability seems to be largely linked to PDO and AMO modulation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In many developing countries and remote areas of important ecosystems, good quality precipitation data are neither available nor readily accessible. Satellite observations and processing algorithms are being extensively used to produce satellite rainfall products (SREs). Nevertheless, these products are prone to systematic errors and need extensive validation before to be usable for streamflow simulations. In this study, we investigated and corrected the bias of Multi-Sensor Precipitation Estimate-Geostationary (MPEG) data. The corrected MPEG dataset was used as input to a semi-distributed hydrological model Hydrologiska Byrans Vattenbalansavdelning (HBV) for simulation of discharge of the Gilgel Abay and Gumara watersheds in the Upper Blue Nile basin, Ethiopia. The result indicated that the MPEG satellite rainfall captured 81% and 78% of the gauged rainfall variability with a consistent bias of underestimating the gauged rainfall by 60%. A linear bias correction applied significantly reduced the bias while maintaining the coefficient of correlation. The simulated flow using bias corrected MPEG SRE resulted in a simulated flow comparable to the gauge rainfall for both watersheds. The study indicated the potential of MPEG SRE in water budget studies after applying a linear bias correction. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This work evaluates the impact of climate change on the water balance of a catchment in India. Rainfall and hydro-meteorological variables for current (20C3M scenario, 1981-2000) and two future time periods: mid of the 21st century (2046-2065) and end of the century (2081-2100) are simulated using Modified Markov Model-Kernel Density Estimation (MMM-KDE) and k-nearest neighbor downscaling models. Climate projections from an ensemble of 5 GCMs (MPI-ECHAM5, BCCR-BCM2.0, CSIRO-mk3.5, IPSL-CM4, and MRI-CGCM2) are used in this study. Hydrologic simulations for the current as well as future climate scenarios are carried out using Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) integrated with ArcGIS (ArcSWAT v.2009). The results show marginal reduction in runoff ratio, annual streamflow and groundwater recharge towards the end of the century. Increased temperature and evapotranspiration project an increase in the irrigation demand towards the end of the century. Rainfall projections for the future shows marginal increase in the annual average rainfall. Short and moderate wet spells are projected to decrease, whereas short and moderate dry spells are projected to increase in the future. Projected reduction in streamflow and groundwater recharge along with the increase in irrigation demand is likely to aggravate the water stress in the region under the future scenario.

AB Hydrologic modeling and other geophysical applications are sensitive to precipitation forcing data quality, and there are known challenges in spatially distributing gauge-based precipitation over complex terrain. We conduct a comparison of six high-resolution, daily and monthly gridded precipitation datasets over the Western United States. We compare the long-term average spatial patterns, and interannual variability of water-year total precipitation, as well as multi-year trends in precipitation across the data sets. We find that the greatest absolute differences among datasets occur in high-elevation areas and in the maritime mountain ranges of the Western United States, while the greatest percent differences among datasets relative to annual total precipitation occur in arid and rain-shadowed areas. Differences between datasets in some high-elevation areas exceed 200 mm yr(-1) on average, and relative differences range from 5 to 60% across the Western United States. In areas of high topographic relief, true uncertainties and biases are likely higher than the differences among the datasets; we present evidence of this based on streamflow observations. Precipitation trends in the datasets differ in magnitude and sign at smaller scales, and are sensitive to how temporal inhomogeneities in the underlying precipitation gauge data are handled.

AB Analogue methods provide a statistical precipitation prediction based on synoptic predictors supplied by general circulation models or numerical weather prediction models. The method samples a selection of days in the archives that are similar to the target day to be predicted, and consider their set of corresponding observed precipitation (the predictand) as the conditional distribution for the target day. The relationship between the predictors and predictands relies on some parameters that characterize how and where the similarity between two atmospheric situations is defined.
   This relationship is usually established by a semi-automatic sequential procedure that has strong limitations: (i) it cannot automatically choose the pressure levels and temporal windows (hour of the day) for a given meteorological variable, (ii) it cannot handle dependencies between parameters, and (iii) it cannot easily handle new degrees of freedom. In this work, a global optimization approach relying on genetic algorithms could optimize all parameters jointly and automatically.
   The global optimization was applied to some variants of the analogue method for the Rhone catchment in the Swiss Alps. The performance scores increased compared to reference methods, especially for days with high precipitation totals. The resulting parameters were found to be relevant and coherent between the different subregions of the catchment. Moreover, they were obtained automatically and objectively, which reduces the effort that needs to be invested in exploration attempts when adapting the method to a new region or for a new predictand. For example, it obviates the need to assess a large number of combinations of pressure levels and temporal windows of predictor variables that were manually selected beforehand. The optimization could also take into account parameter inter-dependencies. In addition, the approach allowed for new degrees of freedom, such as a possible weighting between pressure levels, and non-overlapping spatial windows. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Understanding the spatial and temporal variability of rainfall has always been a great challenge, and the impacts of climate change further complicate this issue. The present study employs the concepts of complex networks to study the spatial connections in rainfall, with emphasis on climate change and rainfall scaling. Rainfall outputs (during 1961-1990) from a regional climate model (i.e. Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model that downscaled the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts, ECMWF ERA-40 reanalyses) over Southeast Asia are studied, and data corresponding to eight different temporal scales (6-hr, 12-hr, daily, 2-day, 4-day, weekly, biweekly, and monthly) are analyzed. Two network-based methods are applied to examine the connections in rainfall: clustering coefficient (a measure of the network's local density) and degree distribution (a measure of the network's spread). The influence of rainfall correlation threshold (T) on spatial connections is also investigated by considering seven different threshold levels (ranging from 0.5 to 0.8). The results indicate that: (1) rainfall networks corresponding to much coarser temporal scales exhibit properties similar to that of small-world networks, regardless of the threshold; (2) rainfall networks corresponding to much finer temporal scales may be classified as either small-world networks or scale-free networks, depending upon the threshold; and (3) rainfall spatial connections exhibit a transition phase at intermediate temporal scales, especially at high thresholds. These results suggest that the most appropriate model for studying spatial connections may often be different at different temporal scales, and that a combination of small-world and scale-free network models might be more appropriate for rainfall upscaling/downscaling across all scales, in the strict sense of scale-invariance. The results also suggest that spatial connections in the studied rainfall networks in Southeast Asia are weak, especially when more stringent conditions are imposed (i.e. when T is very high), except at the monthly scale.

AB Air pollution represents a critical issue in Milan urban area (Northern Italy). Here, the levels of fine particles increase, overcoming the legal limits, mostly in wintertime, due to favourable calm weather conditions and large heating and vehicular traffic emissions. The main goal of this work is to quantify the aerosol removal effect due to precipitation at the ground. At first, the scavenging coefficients have been calculated for aerosol particles with diameter between 0.25 and 3 mu m. The average values of this coefficient vary between 2 x 10(-5) and 5 x 10(-5) s(-1). Then, the aerosol removal induced separately by precipitation and wind have been compared through the introduction of a removal index. As a matter of fact, while precipitation leads to a proper wet scavenging of the particles from the atmosphere, high wind speeds cause enhanced particle dispersion and dilution, that locally bring to a tangible decrease of aerosol particles' number. The removal triggered by these two forcings showed comparable average values, but different trends. The removal efficiency of precipitation lightly increases with the increase of particle diameters and vice versa happens with strong winds. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Microcystin-LR (MC-LR) can cause serious injuries upon short and long-term exposures that can be prevented by LASSBio-596 (LB-596), an anti-inflammatory compound. We aimed to test LB-596 following subchronic exposure to MC-LR. Swiss mice received 10 intraperitoneal injections of distilled water (DW) or MC-LR (20 mu g/kg bw) every 2 days. On the 10th injection animals receiving DW were gavaged with DW or 50 mg/kg bw of LB-596 for 1 or 7 days (C1D, C7D, CL1D and CL7D groups), whereas those exposed to MC-LR received either DW or 50 mg/kg of LB-596 for I or 7 days (T1D, T7D, TL1D and TL7D groups). Twelve hours after the last gavage we assessed respiratory mechanics, and extracted lung and liver for histology, apoptosis, inflammatory biomarkers and MC-LR content. CID, C7D, CL1D and CL7D were all similar. Mechanical parameters were significantly higher in T1D and T7D compared to the other groups. LB-596 reversed these changes on day 1 of administration. LB-596 reduced inflammatory mediators in lung and liver on day 1 of treatment. On day 7 apoptosis in liver and lung fell even more. Briefly, 7-day administration completely reversed lung and liver changes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In order to evaluate the susceptibility of sheep to V. rubricaulis and to establish the clinical signs, serum biochemistry, and pathological findings, eight sheep were fed varying doses of V. rubricaulis. The onset of clinical signs occurred 6-48 h after the ingestion of V. rubricaulis. Clinical courses lasted 6-56 h after the ingestion of the plant. Serum activities of aspartate aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, and alkaline phosphatase were highly elevated and glucose blood levels were low in affected sheep. Clinical signs consisted of apathy, anorexia, dry muzzle, respiratory distress, abdominal pain, and mushy feces with streaks of blood and mucus. Two sheep had neurological signs including muscle fasciculation, nystagmus, paddling movements, and blindness. Liver necrosis could be detected antemortem through liver biopsy. Five sheep died and three recovered. The liver was affected in all necropsied sheep; it increased in volume and had marked accentuation of the lobular pattern with red, depressed areas intercalated with a pale yellow network. Ascites and hydropericardium were consistent findings. Microscopically, centrilobular to massive coagulative necrosis was observed. Coagulative necrosis was also observed in a few proximal renal tubules. Microscopic lesions were not found in any other organs. The severity of liver lesions was proportional to the dose. Chemical analysis to detect carboxyatractyloside in V. rubricaulis plant material was negative. It is concluded that V. rubricaulis poisoning in sheep is clinically, biochemically, and pathologically characteristic of an acute hepatoxicosis. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All-rights reserved.

AB Local anesthesia is an effective method to control pain. Neosaxitoxin is a phycotoxin whose molecular mechanism includes a reversible inhibition of voltage gated sodium channels at the axonal level, impeding nerve impulse propagation. The present study was designed to evaluate the clinical efficacy of Neosaxitoxin as a local long-acting pain blocker in horse bucked shins, and it was found to effectively control pain. While Neosaxitoxin and Gonyautoxin, another Paralytic Shellfish Poison (PSP) toxin, have been successfully used in humans as long-lasting pain blockers, this finding marks the first time a PSP has been shown to have an established effect in veterinary medicine.

AB This review catalogues recent advances in knowledge on venoms as standalone therapeutic agents or as blueprints for drug design, with an emphasis on venom-derived compounds that affects the immune system. We discuss venoms and venom-derived compounds that affect total immune cell numbers, immune cell proliferation, immune cell migration, immune cell phenotype and cytokine secretion. Identifying novel compounds that 'tune' the system, up-regulating the immune response during infectious disease and cancer and down-regulating the immune response during autoimmunity, will greatly expand the tool kit of human immunotherapeutics. Targeting these pathways may also open therapeutic options that alleviate symptoms of envenomation. Finally, combining recent advances in venomics with progress in low cost, high-throughput screening platforms will no doubt yield hundreds of prototype immune modulating compounds in the coming years.

AB The number of snakes donated to the Brazilian Instituto Butantan has been decreasing in the past 10 years. This circumstance motivated us to compare the properties of five venom pools of Bothrops jararaca snake stored for up to 54 years. Results showed differences among venom pools regarding enzymatic and other biological activities, such as caseinolytic, phospholipase A(2,) hemorrhagic and coagulant activities, as well as antigenicity. Protein content, reverse-phase chromatographic profile, and immunorecognition by commercial Bothrops antivenom were comparable for all venom pools, although lethality of the most recent preparations was higher. Since the lowest functional activities did not always correspond to older venoms, differences among venom pools used for antivenom production during the period 1963-2008 may correlate with the different proportions of venoms from different localities used in their generation, rather than to long-term storage. We conclude that B. jararaca venoms properly stored for long periods of time retain their structural and pharmacological activities, thus representing useful materials for scientific research and antivenom production.

AB Micrurus snakes, commonly known as coral snakes, are responsible for 0.4% of the snakebites envenomings in Brazil. In this report, we describe a case of envenoming by Micrurus averyi, the black-headed coral snake, recorded in the western Brazilian Amazon. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first published case perpetrated by this species. The major complaint of the patient was an intense local pain and paresthesia. Examination of the bite site revealed edema extending from the left foot up the left leg that was accompanied by erythema involving the foot and distal third of the leg. Systemic signs at admission included nausea and drooling. The patient was treated with 100 mL of coral snake antivenom and intravenous analgesics (dipyrone) and was discharged 48 h post-admission with no complaints. The patient showed more intense local edema than that generally described in several other cases of Micrurus bites in Brazil. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The present work aimed to isolate a basic phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) from Bothrops diporus snake venom (BdV), evaluate and compare the myotoxic and oedema-inducing activities, as well as the systemic effects caused by both the isolated PLA(2) and BdV on Swiss mice. A Lys-49 PLA(2) (BdipTX-I) was obtained through two chromatographic steps: an ion-exchange and a reverse phase. The local (oedema and myotoxicity) and systemic (hepatic and renal functions) effects were then assessed for BdipTX-I and BdV. Results showed that the oedema-inducing activity was significant in all tested doses (5 and 20 mu g/paw) for both BdipTX-I and BdV. Myotoxicity was evaluated by the increase of serum CK, CK-MB and LDH, and results showed that BdV effect is more prominent than BdipTX-I effect. The systemic effects were evaluated by determining specific laboratory markers: AST, ALT, GGT, ALP, urea, creatinine, protein and calcium. BdipTX-I and BdV were able to induce renal changes in the experimental model, leading to proteinuria (induced both by BdipTX-I and by BdV) and uremia (induced only by BdV). Thus, it is concluded that the systemic effects of BdV and BdipTX-I occur differently. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Two acidic Asp(49)-PLA(2)s with Glu(6) substitution and a neutral Lys(49)-PLA (designated Gst-K49) were cloned from G. strauchii venom glands, their full amino acid sequences were deduced. The predominant acidic PLA(2) (designated Gst-E6a) contains 124 residues and the (MW30)-W-18 substitutions, while the minor acidic PLA(2) (designated Gst-E6b) contains 122 residues and the V(18)A(30) substitutions. Their sequences are most similar to those of the respective orthologous PLA(2)s of G. intermedius venom. Gst-E6a and Gst-E6b appear to be paralogs and possibly have different predatory targets or functions. The LC-MS/MS results indicate the presence of only three PLA(2) gene products in the crude venom, the relative expression levels were in the order of Gst-E6a >> Gst-E6b > Gst-K49, as confirmed by OCR results. In contrast to other Gloydius, G. strauchii venom does not contain neurotoxic or basic anticoagulant Asp(49)-PLA(2)s, but Gst-K49 is the first Lys(49)-PLA(2) identified in Gloydius venoms. However, its venom content is relatively low and its pI value 7.3 is much lower than those of other Lys(49)-PLA(2)s and. The Lys(49)-PLA(2) genes appear to regress in the venom of most of Gloydius and related rattlesnake, and this evolutionary regression occurred before the dispersal of Asian pitvipers to the New World.

AB Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is the main bacterial cause of dehydrating infant diarrhoea in less developed countries. Labile toxin (LT) is the major virulent factor of ETEC. Easy diagnostic tests are necessary to reduce the number of cases. Immunological methods have some drawbacks and also have important limitations. For that reason, a Liquid Chromatography coupled to UV detector technique (LC-UV) has been optimize to a rapid identification and quantification of LT from bacteria cultures. It is also important to know optimal conditions for LT and with this purpose several enterotoxigenic E. coli strains have been studied to determine the influence of glucose concentration and different culture media on LT production.
   LC-UV technique demonstrated to be a good method for LT quantification showing values of 15 ng/mL and 45 ng/mL for limits of detection and quantification respectively. LT quantification revealed that toxin production is directly related to the concentration of glucose added in the broth medium. Tryptic Soy Broth is the most efficient culture medium for E. coli growth and enterotoxin production. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The scorpionism in Panama is notorious for the confluence and coexistence of buthid scorpions from the genera Centruroides and Tityus. This communication describes an overview of the larger representative toxic venom fractions from eight dangerous buthid scorpion species of Panama: Centruroides (C. granosus, C. bicolor, C limbatus and C. panamensis) and Tityus (T (A.) asthenes, T. (A.) festae, T. (T.) cerroazul and T (A.) pachyurus). Their venoms were separated by HPLC and the corresponding sub-fractions were tested for lethality effects on mice and insects. Many fractions toxic to either mice or insects, or both, were found and have had their molecular masses determined by mass spectrometry analysis. The great majority of the lethal components had a molecular mass close to 7000 Da, assumed to be peptides that recognize Na+-channels, responsible for the toxicity symptoms observed in other buthids scorpion venoms. A toxic peptide isolated from the venom of T pachyurus was sequenced by Edman degradation, allowing the synthesis of nucleotide probe for cloning the correspondent gene. The mature toxin based on the cDNA sequencing has the C-terminal residue amidated, contains 62 amino acid packed by 4 disulfide linkages, with molecular mass of 7099.1 Da. This same toxic peptide seems to be present in scorpions of the species T. pachyurus collected in 5 different regions of Panama, although the overall HPLC profile is quite different. The most diverse neurotoxic venom components from the genus Centruroides were found in the species C. panamensis, whereas T cerroazul was the one from the genus Tityus. The most common neurotoxins were observed in the venoms of T. festae, T asthenes and T pachyurus with closely related molecular masses of 7099.1 and 7332 Da.
   The information reported here is considered very important for future generation of a neutralizing antivenom against scorpions from Panama. Furthermore, it will contribute to the growing interest in using bioactive toxins from scorpions for drug discovery purposes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Despite substantial advances in uncovering constituents of parasitoid venoms due to their potential applications as insecticides and pharmaceuticals, most of these studies are primarily restricted to braconid and ichneumonid wasps. Little information is available regarding virulent factors from venom of Eulophidae. In order to provide insight into the venom components of this family and parasitoid venom evolution, a venom protein repertoire (venomics) of the endoparasitoid wasp, Tetrastichus brontispae was deciphered using a proteomic approach. A large number of diverse venom proteins/peptides were identified, including novel proteins and those proteins commonly found in the venoms of other parasitoids such as serine protease, esterase, dipeptidyl peptidase IV, acid phosphatase, major royal jelly protein, superoxide dismutase, and venom allergen 3/5. Three ion transport peptide-likes (ITPLs) were abundantly detected in T. brontispae venom. Of these, two of them are reported as a novel form for the first time, with the characteristics of lengthened amino acid sequences and additional cysteine residues. These venom ITPLs are obviously apart from other general members within the crustacean hyperglycemic hormone/ion transport peptide (CHH/ITP) family. It implies that they would evolve unique functions essential for parasitism success. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, we aimed to investigate the testicular toxicity of two molecules derived from bee venom (BV): phospholipase A2 (PIA2) and melittin (Mlt). Ultrastructural effects of purified BV PIA2 and Mlt were assessed consecutive to repeated dose (30 days) and acute toxicity studies. For the subchronic treatment, PIA2 and Mlt were injected in daily doses equivalent to those released by a bee sting (105 mu g PIA2/kg/day and 350 mu g Mlt/kg/day), while in the acute treatment their doses corresponded to those released by 100 bee stings (9.3 mg PIA2/kg and 31 mg Mlt/kg). Both PIA2 and Mlt affected the Leydig cells and the cells in seminiferous tubules, the Sertoli cells first of all. PIA2 injection resulted in detachment of the Sertoli cells from the surrounding cells, and extracellular vacuolations, cytoplasmic vacuolations in their basal region and in branches as well, detachment of spermatids, residual bodies and sometimes even spermatocytes into the lumen, changes that had a higher magnitude after the acute treatment. Mlt injection induced similar ultrastructural alterations, but more severe, including degeneration of cellular organelles and cellular necrosis, resulting into rarefaction of the seminiferous epithelium; the ultrastructural changes had a higher magnitude after the 30 repeated dose treatment. We concluded that either of the two molecules tested here, PIA2 and Mlt, were Sertoli cells toxicants at the used doses, and they participated both in the BV testicular toxicity. We consider the observed changes as part of a preceding mechanism of the more severe alterations produced by the By. It also remains possible that these early unspecific changes reported here could represent the response of the SCs not only to the components of bee venom, but to molecules of other venoms as well. The Sertoli cells were the primary target of PIA2 and Mlt in the spermatogenic epithelium, and their alteration led to further degenerative changes of the germ cells. Since the exposure to PIA2 and Mlt caused severe alteration, including cell death and detachment of immature germ cells into the lumen, we may also conclude that the bee venom molecules had a potential to interfere with normal progression of spermatogenesis. All the degenerative changes observed in the Sertoli cells were accompanied with changes of the Leydig cells. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Fumonisin B-1 (FB1) is a ubiquitous contaminant of maize that is epidemiologically linked to oesophageal cancer (OC) in South Africa. FB1-induced oxidative stress mediates toxicity in animals and human cell lines, but the effects relating to OC are limited. Given the species-specific effects of FB1, this study investigated FB1-mediated toxicity and oxidative stress in spindle-shaped N-cadherin (+) CD45 (-) osteoblastic (SNO) cells. Following exposure to FB1 (0-20 mu M) for 48 h, mitochondrial membrane potential and intracellular reactive oxygen species (iROS) were measured (flow cytometry). Malondialdehyde concentration (lipid peroxidation) was determined spectrophotometrically. ATP and reduced glutathione (GSH) concentrations were quantified using luminometry, gene expression of SOD2 by qPCR and protein expression of SOD2, GPx1, Nrf2 and HSP70 by western blotting. Mitochondrial depolarization increased at 10 mu M and 20 mu M FB1, with a concomitant reduction in ATP, iROS and GSH at both concentrations. Lipid peroxidation increased at 10 mu M FB1 exposure. While transcript levels of SOD2 were significantly increased, protein levels decreased. Protein expression of GPx1, Nrf2 and HSP70 increased. In contrast to the 10 mu M and 20 mu M FB1 treatment, mitochondrial depolarization decreased at 1.25 mu M FB1. Intracellular ROS and ATP were decreased and lipid peroxidation increased. Decreased GSH was accompanied by a decrease in GPx1 protein levels, and increased HSP70 and Nrf2. SOD2 expression and protein levels were significantly increased. Overall these results indicate that FB1 caused increased ROS that were counteracted by engaging the antioxidant defense. Furthermore, the peculiar response at 1.25 mu M FB1 is noteworthy, as compared to the other two concentrations tested. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Cases of Clostridium perfringens septicemia, such as liver abscess, often develop a rapidly progressive intravascular hemolysis and coagulation; the mortality rate with current standard care including antibiotics and surgery is high. Herein, we firstly investigated the effects of gas gangrene antitoxin (GGA) (antitoxin against C. perfringens) and recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin (rTM) on the hemolysis, coagulation status, inflammatory process, and mortality in a-toxin-treated rats. Male 11-week-old Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into five groups: control group, a-toxin group, GGA group, rTM group, and combined GGA and rTM (combination group). After a-toxin injection, mortality and platelet counts, and hemolysis were observed for 6 h. The fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products (FDP), and plasma high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) were also measured at 6 h. The combination group demonstrated 100% survival compared with 50% survival in the alpha-toxin group and demonstrated significantly improved hemolysis, platelet counts, and lactate levels compared with those in the a-toxin group (p < .01). The FDP and HMGB1 levels in the combination therapy group were significantly lower than those in the a-toxin group (p < .05). Combination therapy with GGA and rTM administration is applicable as adjunct therapy for fatal C. perfringens sepsis. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Prion and some other incurable human neurodegenerative diseases are associated with misfolding of specific proteins, followed by the formation of amyloids. Despite the widespread usage of the transmission electron and of the atomic force microscopy for studing such amyloids, many related methodological issues still have not been studied until now. Here, we consider one of the first amyloids found in Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast, i.e. Sup35NMp, to study the adsorption of monomeric protein and its fibrils on the surface of mica, silica, gold and on formvar film. Comparison of linear characteristics of these units calculated by processing of images obtained by the atomic force, transmission and scanning electron microscopy was carried out. The minimal number of measurements of fibril diameters to obtain the values in a given confidence interval were determined. We investigated the film formed by monomeric protein on mica surface, which veiled some morphology features of fibrils. Besides, we revealed that parts of the Sup35NMp excluded from the fibril core can form a wide "coat". The length of the protein forming the core of the fibrils was estimated.

AB In cryogenic correlated light and electron microscopy (cryo-CLEM), frozen targets of interest are identified and located on EM grids by fluorescence microscopy and then imaged at higher resolution by cryo-EM. Whilst working with these methods, we discovered that a variety of mammalian cells exhibit strong punctate auto fluorescence when imaged under cryogenic conditions (80 K). Autofluorescence originated from multilamellar bodies (MLBs) and secretory granules. Here we describe a method to distinguish fluorescent protein tags from these autofluorescent sources based on the narrower emission spectrum of the former. The method is first tested on mitochondria and then applied to examine the ultrastructural variability of secretory granules within insulin secreting pancreatic beta-cell-derived INS-1E cells.

AB F-ATP synthases are described to have mechanisms which regulate the unnecessary depletion of ATP pool during an energy limited state of the cell. Mg-ADP inhibition is one of the regulatory features where Mg-ADP gets entrapped in the catalytic site, preventing the binding of ATP and further inhibiting ATP hydrolysis. Knowledge about the existence and regulation of the related archaeal-type A(1)A(0) ATP synthases (A(3)B(3)CDE(2)FG(2)ac) is limited. We demonstrate MgADP inhibition of the enzymatically active A(3)B(3)D- and A(3)B(3)DF complexes of Methanosarcina mazei GM A-ATP synthase and reveal the importance of the amino acids P235 and S238 inside the P-loop (GPFGSGKTV) of the catalytic A subunit. Substituting these two residues by the respective P-loop residues alanine and cysteine (GAFGCGKTV) of the related eukaryotic V-ATPase increases significantly the ATPase activity of the enzyme variant and abolishes MgADP inhibition. The atomic structure of the P235A, S238C double mutant of subunit A of the Pyrococcus horikoshii OT3 A-ATP synthase provides details of how these critical residues affect nucleotide-binding and ATP hydrolysis in this molecular engine. The qualitative data are confirmed by quantitative results derived from fluorescence correlation spectroscopy experiments.

AB Combining fluorescence microscopy with electron cryo-tomography allows, in principle, spatial localization of tagged macromolecular assemblies and structural features within the cellular environment. To allow precise localization and scale integration between the two disparate imaging modalities, accurate alignment procedures are needed. Here, we describe a marker-free method for aligning images from light or cryo-light fluorescence microscopy and from electron cryo-microscopy that takes advantage of sample support features, namely the holes in the carbon film. We find that the accuracy of this method, as judged by prediction errors of the hole center coordinates, is better than 100 nm.

AB Regulated proteolysis is required in all organisms for the removal of misfolded or degradation-tagged protein substrates in cellular quality control pathways. The molecular machines that catalyze this process are known as ATP-dependent proteases with examples that include ClpAP and ClpCP. Clp/Hsp100 subunits form ring-structures that couple the energy of ATP binding and hydrolysis to protein unfolding and subsequent translocation of denatured protein into the compartmentalized ClpP protease for degradation. Copies of the clpA, clpC, clpE, clpK, and clpL genes are present in all characterized bacteria and their gene products are highly conserved in structure and function. However, the evolutionary relationship between these proteins remains unclear. Here we report a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis that suggests divergent evolution yielded ClpA from an ancestral ClpC protein and that ClpE/ClpL represent intermediates between ClpA/ClpC. This analysis also identifies a group of proteobacterial ClpC proteins that are likely not functional in regulated proteolysis. Our results strongly suggest that bacterial ClpC proteins should not be assumed to all function identically due to the structural differences identified here.

AB Sequence-definable polymers are seen as a prerequisite for design of future materials, with many polymer scientists regarding such polymers as the holy grail of polymer science. Recombinant proteins are sequence-defined polymers. Proteins are dictated by DNA templates and therefore the sequence of amino acids in a protein is defined, and molecular biology provides tools that allow redesign of the DNA as required. Despite this advantage, proteins are underrepresented in materials science. In this publication we investigate the advantages and limitations of using proteins as templates for rational design of new materials.

AB The thermal performance of a battery thermal management system (BTMS) can be enhanced by cooling strategies, which are seldom taken into account in the study of heat pipe-based BTMS (HP-BTMS). The effects of coolant flow rate, ambient temperature, coolant temperature and start-up time on the thermal performance of HP-BTMS are crucial for the development of cooling strategies and are experimentally investigated in the present study. Results show that the thermal performance of HP-BTMS increases slighdy with the decrease of ambient temperature as it is under 25 degrees C. When the ambient temperature is tmder 35 degrees C, the thermal performance of HP-BTMS can be'kept nearly unchanged by reducing coolant temperature. The enhancement is litde when ambient temperature is under 25 degrees C. Additionally, a drastic rise in the non-uniformity of battery temperature is observed at the moment of HP-BTMS initiation if HP-BTMS starts operating after battery temperature exceeds equilibrium value. Finally, intermittent cooling and constant cooling can achieve similar battery cooling performance, which indicates that the power consumption can be reduced by decreasing running time of HP-BTMS.

AB A hybrid energy harvester combining piezoelectric and electromagnetic transduction mechanisms is designed to harvest vibration energy. The system comprises of a cantilever beam PZT harvester and a magnetic mass hung through a spring at the free end. The beam with PZT harvests energy using piezoelectric effect while the hanging mass oscillates through a copper coil to harvest electromagnetic energy. This paper studies power harvested from the hybrid harvester under harmonic excitation using experimental and analytical evaluations. Comparisons are made with the standalone piezoelectric and electromagnetic harvesters under similar excitation environment. The study shows that the present hybrid harvester can harvest energy at a broad range of frequencies. Furthermore, a few parametric studies are carried out to Understand the device output performance. The bandwidth of the harvester and the power harvested within the bandwidth can be designed based on the stiffness of the system and also by changing the electromechanical coupling coefficient. Studies reported also show that bandwidth of harvester can also be increased by increasing the magnetic mass.

AB Phase change material (PCM) used in building can enhance the thermal inertia of building and improve the indoor thermal comfort. A novel shape-stabilized phase change material wallboard (PCMW), in which paraffin was as the PCM and expanded perlite (EP) was the supporting material, has been prepared through a horizontal vacuum absorption rotate roller (HVARR) in this study. Its melting point and freezing point were measured to be 27.60 degrees C and 23.56 degrees C, respectively, and the melting and freezing latent heats reached to be 67.13 J/g and 67.06 J/g, respectively. PCMW was experimentally and numerically studied to analyze the thermal performance. The experimental result in 5 days, which was a demonstration in a container subject to weather conditions typical for the north China, showed that PCMW used in the building can maximally reduce the indoor temperature of 2.53 K. Eor the numerical study, based on the equivalent heat capacity method, a one-dimensional heat transfer model of PCMW was developed and combined with TRNSYS. This model was validated by the experimental data, and the numerical data agreed well with the experiment data. Under the summer condition, the numerical study of PCMW used in a typical office building during two months showed PCMW can averagely reduce the temperature of 9.22 K in the building operation time (7:00-18:00). Besides, according to the numerical model, an optimal configuration of PCMW in the cold zone of China has been obtained. The studied method provides a comprehensive guide to the PCMW design and application.

AB Using nanofluids in thermal energy devices, such as flat-plate solar collectors, is gradually making progress, and getting awareness in the scientific community. Experiments were performed to study the effect of using CeO2-water on the efficiency of flat-plate solar collector by three different volume fractions of CeO2 nanoparticles of 0.0167%, 0.0333% and 0.0666%, while the mean particle dimension was kept constant at 25 nm. An ultrasonic process was used for maintaining the stability of the CO2-water nanofluid. The working fluid mass flux rates were 0.015, 0.018 and 0.019 kg/s m(2). The experiments were carried out in Budapest, Hungary on the latitude of 47 degrees 28'N and longitude of 19 degrees 03'E. Higher collector efficiency was achieved when using CeO2-water nanofluid compared to results achieved with water application. Based on present data, the efficiency of the collector is directly proportional with the mass flux rate and with the volume fraction in the ranges of the present study. Experiments indicate that the highest rise in efficiency of the collector at zero value of [(Ti-T-a)/G(T)] is 10.74%, for volume fraction (phi) 0.066%, and for mass flux rate of 0.019 kg/s m(2) compared to water.

AB This research contributes to the ongoing discussions about the grid-connected solar photovoltaic (PV) systems and draws attention to the optimal design by considering various PV array tracking systems towards enhancing the power generation. The PV tracking system configurations considered in this study include horizontal-axis (monthly adjustment, weekly adjustment, daily adjustment, continuous adjustment), vertical-axis (continuous adjustment), and a two-axis tracking system. HOMER (Hybrid Optimization of Multiple Energy Resources) software is employed whereas the actual data required by the model have been collected in Makkah, Saudi Arabia.
   The results show that the two-axis tracker can produce 34% more power than the fixed system, while the vertical axis tracker with continuous adjustment was able to generate up to 20% more power than the fixed system. Horizontal tracker with continuous adjustment shows the highest net present cost (NPC) and the highest levelized cost of energy (LCOE), with a high penetration of solar energy to the grid. For the case of Makkah, the vertical axis tracker with continuous adjustment is the best option as it has low LCOE and NPC values with a positive return on investment (ROI) as well as high renewable energy penetration to the grid, which enhances its viability for a utility-size solar PV grid-connected system.

AB The anatomical characteristics, chemical composition, enzymatic hydrolysis efficiency and lignin characteristics of four energy crops (switchgrass, Miscanthus x giganteus, Hybrid Pennisetum, and Triarrhena lutarioriparia) before and after hydrothermal treatment (180 degrees C, 1 h) were investigated comprehensively to evaluate their potential for the bioenergy production. The hydrothermal treatment resulted in the deconstruction of the biomass cell walls and redistribution of the main components, accompanying with the removal of most hemicelluloses and partial lignin as well as favorable exposure of cellulose. These alterations significantly increased the efficiency of enzymatic hydrolysis, and the different recalcitrance of the four feedstocks was evenly erased by hydrothermal treatment. Among the four crops, Hybrid Pennisetum. with high cellulose and low lignin contents had a better performance in the enzymatic hydrolysis process both before and after treatment. Meanwhile, the maximum concentration of low degree of polymerization xylo-oligosaccharides (2-6) and the lowest amount of degraded products were obtained from Hybrid Pennisetum during the treatment process. Moreover, the structural features of the residual lignin in the treated substrates were elaborately analyzed for deeply understanding the fundamental chemistry of lignin during the treatment. The present study is beneficial to the fully effective utilization of biomass components and extension of the energy sources.

AB Among the wide technological opportunities to reduce CO2 emissions in the transportation sector, Waste Heat Recovery (WHR), done by Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) power units, was subject of a great scienti0c interest. However, several complications apply for an on-board operation and management, which reduce its real benefit in terms of net fuel consumption reduction. Weight increase, encumbrances, engine backpressure, intrinsic off design operating conditions are all negative aspects which should be still solved.
   In this paper, the interest is focused on the limiting factors of an ORC-based unit operating on board: engine backpressure due to Heat Recovery Vapor Generator (HRVG) presence, surface of the condenser and additional weight. All these aspects behave as limiting factors of the WHR. Considering the mechanical power produced by the unit as a desired input value, the paper discusses the HRVG and condenser sizing as a function of engine backpressure, weight increase and vehicle frontal area required by the condenser.
   The engine considered was an LVECO F1C turbocharged diesel engine and the reference vehicle was a light duty one. Experimental data have been used for gas temperature and flow rates. The paper considers also the possible presence of an internal regeneration within the ORC which increases plant efficiency (reducing the dimensions of the HRVG and condenser) but introduces an additional heat exchanger. A correlation between weight of the heat exchangers and condenser frontal area as a function of the mechanical power recovered has been presented, without and with the regeneration stage.

AB Utilizing the waste heat of exhausted steam in power plant as a new type of heat source is a key direction to achieve both energy-saving and clean urban heating. In order to recycle all the exhausted steam waste heat of multiple turbine units in designing condition, the authors' research group proposed a new cascade heating system with multi-heat source and applied it in several air cooling power plants in China. This paper focused on the system integration improving and operation strategy formulating, the main studies included: (1) Established the calculation model of system heating characteristics, and analyzed the problems about energy efficiency of system and safety of air cooled condenser in full operating conditions. (2) Introduced the "equivalent electricity of heating" as the evaluation method of comprehensive energy efficiency of the new co-generation heating system. (3) Improved the integration of heating system to further realize energy cascade utilization between turbine units. (4) Aiming at the improved heating system, the comprehensive optimization ideas of operational parameters in full operating conditions were put forward. By above methods, on one hand the "equivalent electricity of heating" of the new co-generation heating system is decreased by 16%, the comprehensive energy efficiency of system is improved, on the other the freezing risk of air cooled condenser is relieved, the operation safety of system is improved.

AB Powertrain electrification including hybridizing advanced combustion engines is a viable cost-effective solution to improve fuel economy of vehicles. This will provide opportunity for narrow-range high-efficiency combustion regimes to be able to operate and consequenfly improve vehicle's fuel conversion efficiency, compared to conventional hybrid electric vehicles. Low temperature combustion (LTC) engines offer the highest peak brake thermal efficiency (BTE) reported in literature, but these engines have narrow operating ranges. In addition, LTC engines have ultra-low soot and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions, compared to conventional compression ignition and spark ignition (SI) engines. In this study, an experimentally developed multi-mode LTC-SI engine is integrated into a parallel hybrid electric configuration, where the engine operation modes include homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI), reactivity controlled compression ignition (RCCI), and conventional SI. The powertrain controller is designed to enable switching among different modes, with minimum fuel penalty for transient engine operations. A pontryagin's minimum principal (PMP) methodology is used in the energy management supervisory controller to study a multi-mode LTC engine in parallel HEV architecture with various hybridization levels. The amount of torque assist by the e-motor can change the LTC mode operating time, which leads to variation in the vehicle's fuel consumption. The results for the urban dynamometer driving schedule (UDDS) driving cycle show the maximum benefit of the multi-mode LTC-SI engine is realized in the mild electrification level, where the LTC mode operating time increases dramatically from 5.0% in a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) to 20.5% in a mild HEV.

AB This work is aimed at optimizing the dimensions of a semicircular-bladed Savonius Style Wind Turbine (SSWT) using Differential Evolution (DE) based inverse optimization methodology to simultaneously satisfy a given power and torque characteristics. The results obtained from the inverse analysis are well-validated with the experimental wind tunnel results available under different wind speeds. The effect of necessary blockage corrections is considered. Using DE-assisted inverse method, the present study demonstrated smaller turbine dimensions than those reported in various literature and also yields a lower value of the blockage ratio. The overall area of the SSWT is found to be reduced upto 9.8% with respect to the corresponding experimental wind tunnel data. The improvement is attributed due to an optimized interplay between multiple combinations of parameters satisfying a given power and torque. To achieve a given power and torque requirement under a given range of tip speed ratio, it appears from the study that the blade overlap can be significantly regulated through minor adjustments of the chord length and turbine height. The sensitivity analysis reveals that the aspect ratio governing parameters such as turbine height and chord length are critical factors governing the torque and power output from SSWTs. In order to meet a desired power and torque, the present study offers a novel inverse methodology aided by the DE algorithm to simultaneously estimate and optimize geometric parameters of SSWT. The benefit of this work is to provide an alternative and optimized solution to the existing literature data where the overall area of SSWT can be reduced and significant material along with space savings can be accomplished.

AB A mathematical model of downdraft gasifier has been developed to simulate steady and transient state of gasification process. The model is based on lumped capacitance method and chemical equilibrium in pyrolysis and oxidation zone and one-dimensional reaction kinetics in reduction zone. Effects of the equivalence ratio (0.37-0.45), steam to biomass ratio (0-4) and mass flow rate of biomass (18-25 kg h(-1)) on the steady and transient characteristics of gasifier have been studied. The model gains good agreement with experimental results for exit gas composition.
   A steady analysis reveals that higher equivalence ratio (ER), lower steam to biomass ratio (S/B) result in a higher reaction temperature, which promotes the yield of H-2 and CO and the char conversion into syngas in this work. For S/B = 0 and mass flow rate of biomass equal to 20.9 kg
   h(-1), char conversion rate increases from 76% to 100% due to increasing of ER from 0.39 to 0.43. For ER = 0.43 and mass flow rate of biomass equal to 20.9kg h(-1), char conversion rate decreases from 84% to 24% due to increasing of S/B from 1 to 4. The molar fraction of gas composition almost remains stable for mass flow rate of biomass in the range of 18-22 kg h(-1).The large mass flow rate of biomass is obviously unfavorable for char conversion due to low temperature. For steam flow rate equal to 0.247 mol s(-1) and air flow rate equal to 0.5326 mol s(-1), the char conversion rate declines from 100% to 71% due to mass flow rate of biomass increasing from 19 to 22 kg h(-1).The higher flow rate of H2O relies on less yield of H-2 if ER is less or S/B is higher corresponding to more steam inducted into gasifier. Transient analysis shows that flow rate of
   H-2 goes down then up with increasing of ER due to competition between oxidation and reduction reactions. As S/B changing alone, the yield of H2O is absolutely dominated by inlet steam whether flow rate of H-2 increases or not.

AB This work addresses a novel microwave-assisted, acid-catalysed, organosolv (EtOH/H2O) system for the selective fractionation of bamboo, examining the effects of the temperature (110-190 degrees C), solvent system (EtOH/H2O) and catalyst amount (0-5 vol.% formic acid) on the process. The statistical analysis of the results revealed that the operating variables have a significant influence on bamboo fractionation, allowing the selective production of (i) a cellulose-rich solid fraction, (ii) a hemicellulose rich water-soluble fraction and (iii) a lignin rich solid fraction. The yields of each of these fractions varied between 51 and 94%, 2 and 23% and 2 and 32%, respectively. Increasing temperature exerted a positive effect on bamboo decomposition, increasing the overall bamboo conversion and influencing the effect that the solvent system (EtOH/H2O) has on the process. At low temperature (110 degrees C) the solvent system does not have much influence, while a synergetic interaction between EtOH and H2O took place at higher temperatures, which allowed better results to be obtained with EtOH/H2O mixtures than with the pure solvents alone. The effect of the catalyst was relatively weak, being greatest when using a high temperature (190 degrees C) and high proportions of water (>85 vol.%) in the solvent system. With respect to the properties of each fraction, the cellulose rich solid fraction was made up of un-reacted cellulose (44-83 wt. %), hemicellulose (0-21 wt.%) and lignin (12-34 wt.%); the water-soluble hemicellulose rich fraction consisted of a mixture of oligomers, sugars, carboxylic acids, ketones and furans; and the solid rich lignin fraction comprised high purity (>95 wt.%) organosolv lignin. The optimisation of the process revealed that by using a temperature of 190 degrees C, a solvent system consisting of 45 vol.% EtOH and 55 vol.% H2O with a concentration of formic acid of 5 vol.% it is possible to fractionate bamboo into a high purity (84 wt.%) cellulose solid fraction, very pure (>95%) organosolv lignin and a rich water-soluble hemicellulose fraction consisting of a mixture of oligomers (27 wt.%), sugars (56 wt.%) and carboxylic acids (14 wt.%); thus converting this process into a very promising method for the selective fractionation of bamboo.

AB Alkaline pretreatment shows a good effect on delignification of lignocellulosic biomass, and carbide slag, an alkaline industrial waste, was first applied to pretreat turfgrass pruning. Three thermo-alkaline pretreatment methods were compared to evaluate their ability to destroy the biomass structure and to enhance the enzymatic hydrolysis effidency of turfgrass pruning, namely therrno-NaOH pretreatment, thermo-lime pretreatment, and thermo-carbide slag pretreatment. Results showed that the maximum net reducing sugar yield of 269.55 mg/g raw biomass was achieved by thermo-carbide slag pretreatment. Compared with raw biomass, the lignin and hemicellulose content of turfgrass pruning after thermo-carbide slag pretreatment reduced by 35.57% and 62.40%, respectively. SEM and FTIR analyses showed that the surface structure and chemical groups of turfgrass pruning were obviously destroyed by thenno-carbide slag pretreatment. There was a high positive correlation between the enzymatic hydrolysis efficiency and cellulose content of substrate. However, a high negative correlation was observed between the enzymatic hydrolysis efficiency and lignin content of substrate. The enzymatic hydrolysis kinetics with different pretreatments were well described by the fractal-like kinetics model, and the rate constant of enzymatic hydrolysis of thermo-alkali pretreated turfgrass pruning was about three times of that of the unpretreated turfgrass pruning. Overall, carbide slag is an ideal pretreatment material for enzymatic hydrolysis of turfgrass pruning in terms of hydrolysis efficiency and waste reuse.

AB Catalyst deactivation by coke deposition was the main barrier in the catalytic pyrolysis of biomass for hydrocarbons, thus deactivated catalysts should be regenerated timely. In this study, several measures were applied in the regeneration process to obtain higher yield of hydrocarbons in the catalytic conversion of biomass-derivates. The effect of oxygen concentration in the regeneration atmosphere on catalytic performance was firstly investigated, and then steam was introduced on the basis of the optimal oxygen concentration to further decrease the internal temperature of catalyst particle. Finally the deactivated catalysts were partially regenerated by retaining some coke. The results showed that 15% was the optimal oxygen concentration, at which the catalysts still showed steady production of olefins and aromatics after 30 cycles of catalysis-regeneration. When 15% oxygen and 5% steam was combined in the regeneration atmosphere, the temperature of catalyst bed was reduced efficiently. The stable yield of hydrocarbons by combined regeneration method was boosted by 31.3% compared with pure 15% oxygen. At retaining coke amount of 2.18%, yield of hydrocarbons was promoted by 27.4% compared with completely regenerated. With the combined oxygen/steam atmosphere and controlled regeneration, the temperature of catalyst particles was well regulated and stable catalysis-regeneration process to produce hydrocarbons via thermochemical utilization of biomass can be realized.

AB Thermal performance of parabolic trough collectors (PTCs) can be improved by suspending nanoparticles into the traditionally used heat transfer fluids. In this work, a one-dimensional mathematical model is proposed to investigate the effect of various nanoprtides suspended in the working fluid for medium and high temperature PTCs. The major finding of this work is that the nanofluid enhances the thermal efficiency of the PTC slightly. High operating temperatures are more suitable for using nanofluids and generate higher relative gains of energy delivered. It is also found that the exergetic efficiency improvement is more important than energetic efficiency. The peak exergy efficiency is achieved by the CuO based nanofluid and is about 9.05%. The maximum daily relative gain of thermal energy delivered is found to be 1.46% by using 5% of Al (2)O(3)in the base fluid. Optimal control of the operating conditions can lead to maximum energetic and exergetic performances of the PTC.

AB Two-phase gravity-driven and gravity-stratified flow regime inside a pipe, which is present in many engineering applications, is an attractive option for solar cooling/heating/power production using Rankine cycles, absorption cycles or any other thermodynamic application by means of vapor as working fluid. This paper offers a numerical model of this flow configuration that copes with transient phenomena, like unsteadiness of solar radiation, among others. The mathematical model consists of 1-D balance equations for mass and momentum for both fluids and energy for both fluids and the wall of the pipe that absorbs the solar radiation. The model is characterized by the fact that the area (or height) of the liquid layer is treated as a dependent variable forming part of the solution. The numerical method consists in a finite volume staggered grid discretization of the governing equations. Mass flow and liquid area are calculated with a semi-implicit pressure based method and the transient terms are treated with the explicit first stage singly implicit Runge-Kutta (ESDIRK) method. The calculation of the mass transfer rate from liquid to vapor is calculated iteratively by a guess-and-correct mass transfer algorithm, specially developed for stratified flows. The results show the applicability and benefits of this model for the not so well known counter-current stratified two-phase with evaporation/boiling. Additionally, the performance of the mass transfer algorithm is discussed showing that it is monotonic decreasing and linearly convergent.

AB The paper proposes a novel solar adsorption refrigeration system employing an active enhancing mass transfer method based on the typical basic cycle. In essence, the new method is to drop the internal pressure of the system in the desorption process. The working principle of the hypothesis and the cycle description are explained in detail and analyzed by laboratory experiments. The novel solar adsorption refrigeration system prototype with activated carbon-methanol as working pair was designed and built. Some different comparative tests under different weather conditions were conducted to prove the hypothesis and evaluate the performance of the novel adsorption refrigeration system. The experimental results show that the system employing an active enhancing mass transfer method will increase the mass of desorbed refrigerant by about 20% if compared with a natural desorption refrigeration system. It was also proved that the novel method is very effective for low adsorbent temperature operation, which may help to obtain a COPsolar increase of at least 16.4%. And about one and half hours can be saved by enhancing desorption refrigeration system to get the same desorbed refrigerant with the natural desorption refrigeration system. The results of experiments show that the novel system has improvements in the coefficient of performance, the mass of desorption and desorption rate, and the characters of the solar adsorption refrigeration system can be a benefit to further application.

AB The high consumption rates of fossil fuel and unburned hydrocarbons pollution in exhaust gases are considered to be the main problems that face the world today. The use of Brown's gas (HHO gas i.e. mixture of hydrogen and oxygen) as a new source of energy, reducing the amount of injected fuel and ensuring complete combustion of the mixture are gaining an increasing interest worldwide. There are two different types of HHO cells; HHO wet cell and HHO dry cell. In this paper, the HHO dry cell was used because it has several advantages, such as its small size and ease to install in engines. The HHO dry cell uses the electrolysis process in order to produce the HHO gas from water, which is ionized by adding NaOH as the electrolyte. Three types of HHO dry cell were used, namely alpha, beta and omega cells. Many measured data were done to choose the best one of the HHO dry cells. Oxygen sensor, MAP sensor, and MAF sensor were used to control the fuel injection. From the recorded measured experimental data, the beta cell has shown a good performance for the engine. The amount of HHO gas needed to be supplied to a 1500 CC engine is 0.375 LPM. The results also showed that there is a 17% reduction in fuel consumption and a 17% reduction in CO, a 27% reduction in HC, a 15% increase in O-2 and a 1% increase in CO2.

AB Cooling of photovoltaic (PV) panels was investigated experimentally outdoors using two nanofluids and water as a cooling medium for volume flow rate ranging from 500 to 5000 mL/min at concentrations (0.01 wt.%, 0.05 wt. %, and 0.1 wt.%) under different radiation intensity. Two types of nanofluids were used, namely Al2O3 in water- polyethylene glycol mixture at pH 5.7, and TiO2 in water- cetyltrimethylammonium bromide mixture at pH 9.7, respectively. The cooling of PV panel required incorporating a heat exchanger of aluminium rectangular cross section at its back surface to accommodate different volume flow rate of the cooling medium aforementioned. The system was tested under climate conditions of Jerash-Jordan, Determination of flow characteristics; friction factor,/and product of friction factor Reynolds number, of TiO2, Al2O3 nanofluids and water as a cooling medium were investigated. Also, a fRe comparison of the temperature between the cooled PV cell and without cooling for volume flow rate ranging from 500 to 5000 mL/min was presented. Results showed that the nanofluid cooled PV cell in both types caused higher decrease in the average PV cell temperature compared with the cooled cell with water and without cooling. In addition, Al2O3 nanofluid showed better performance than TiO2 nanofluid. Furthermore, experimental results showed that higher concentration of nanofluid produces a better cooling effect of the PV cell for all the studied range of volume flow rate. Also, electrical analysis of power and efficiency showed that TiO2 nanofluid gives better perfomance for the studied range of volume flow rate and concentrations compared with water cooling and without cooling.

AB The present study aims to assess the tectonic activity in the Erin basin (NE Kashmir) on the basis of several relevant geomorphic indices and field observations. We use Digital Elevation Model (SRTM) and Survey of India (SoI) topographic maps in GIS environment to compute the geomorphic indices. The indices i.e., convex hypsometric curve, high hypsometric integral value (H-i > 0.5), low basin elongation ratio (Eb = 0.17), low mountain front sinuosity values (S-mf = 1.08 average), low valley floor width ratios. (Vf < 1), topographic assymetric character (T < 1), uneven basin asymmetry factor (AF < 50), elongated shape (Bs > 4) suggest that the area is tectonically active. Moreover, prominent irregularities (knickpoints/knickzones) along longitudinal profile of the Erin River even in homogenous resistant lithology (Panjal trap) and anomalous stream gradient index (SL) values reflect that the Erin basin is dissected by two faults (EF-1 and EF-2) with NNW-SSE and SSW-NNE trends respectively. The results of this preliminary study further substantiate the recent GPS studies, which argue that the maximum strain is accumulating in the NE part of the Kashmir Himalaya.

AB Knowledge of hydroclimatic dynamics in the East Asian monsoon region during the Holocene was hindered by few absolutely-dated and decadally-resolved proxy records in northern China. Here we present replicated carbonate 8180 records of six stalagmites with sub-decadal to multi-decadal resolutions from the Lianhua cave to reveal a detailed evolution of the East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM) intensity in northern China since 11.5 thousand years before present (ka BP, before 1950 CE). Our composite record shows that solar forcing dominated hydroclimatic changes regionally, including an intensified monsoon at the Holocene Optimum from the termination of Younger Dryas to 6.5 ka BP, and a subsequent multi-millennial weakening monsoon, that agrees with cave records in central and southern China. However, the EASM has retreated southwards more rapidly than the Indian summer monsoon after similar to 6.5 ka BP, resulting in aridity conditions occurring at 4.0 ka BP in northern China, which is almost 2000-year earlier than that in central and southern China. This north-south asynchroneity is likely related to the different regional responses among the coupling of the EASM, Indian summer monsoon, the solar forcing, and the differences in thermal forcing due to complex geographical configurations. In addition, a relative enrichment of 1 parts per thousand in O-18 data of the Lianhua record from 9.5 to 8.1 ka BP shows that the Holocene Optimum was punctuated by a millennial-long weakening monsoon interval, which is not registered among previous cave records in central and southern China. The fresh water-induced cold climate conditions in the North Atlantic region could create stronger East Asian winter monsoon, and induce a weakened EASM and a southward shift of rain belt in northern China. Therefore, it shall not be surprised that there are strong heterogeneities among regional hydroclimatic conditions across monsoonal China, given the complex interplay between external and internal forcing mechanisms over the entire Holocene.

AB New Chirp seismic data collected from the northern margin of the Marmara Sea in June 2015 and previous Sparker seismic profiles recorded. in 1999 suggest a change in tectonic regime in Messinian. New tectonic lineaments and fault segments were detected at offshore the cekmece lagoons region that is located on one of the possible water corridors with the Paratethys. The faults only affect the older seismic unit (U1), which can be best outlined on the Chirp data. The E-W trending fault offshore Avcilar (OAF) borders the northern edge of a tightly folded sedimentary zone. The NNE-SSW trending fault, namely the Buyukcekmece Fault (BF), passing through the Buyukcekmece Bay, follows a buried valley. Its evolution must be related to the development of the Early Miocene - Early Pliocene Thrace-Eskisehir fault zone (TEFZ). BF and OAF indicate old tectonic activities. in the region, which continued to the North Anatolian fault becoming the most dominant tectonic element in the region. The tappet surface of the stratigraphic unit U1 and its terraces define the thickness of younger deposits (U2), which is thinner in the middle of the shelf. The morphology of the tightly folded zone controls those terraces, which correspond to the Bakirkoy Formation and Kirac member on land. The topmost parts of the terraces must have been eroded during sea level low-stands and cutting of the paleo-valleys. There is no evidence of any tectonic deformation or active fault in the younger seismic unit (U2).

AB The timing of the development of the highland topography along the northern margin of the Tibetan Plateau is the key to understanding the manner of Tibetan growth and the far-field effects of the collision between India and Eurasia. Although various studies have investigated the exhumation and uplift of the basement rocks, thermochronological studies on the detritus from a continuous depositional sequence inan intermontane basin are lacking but might shed light on this issue. In this study, a set of detrital apatites from an upper Eocene to Pliocene depositional sequence in the Kumukol Basin, the largest intermontane basin in the East Kunlun, were dated by using the (U-Th)/He technique. The detrital apatites had consistent ages of similar to 40 Ma for all deposit formations from bottom to top, which were older than the depositional ages. The ages and their consistency suggested that these detrital apatites were not reset and that the ages represented the original ages in the provenance region. These detrital apatite ages from the upper Eocene to Pliocene formations strongly suggested that the high mountains surrounding the Kumukol Basin formed at or before similar to 40 Ma and have remained high since then. The process of mountain building resulted in a prolonged period of erosion from 40 to 2.6 Ma. The coupling of mountain and basin at similar to 40 Ma was widespread along the East Kunlun. Our present results constrain the time of onset of the mountain building along the northern margin of the Tibetan Plateau, which may represent a rapid response to the India-Eurasian collision.

AB The Qinling-Dabie orogenic belt was formed by the collision of the North and South China Cratons during the Early Mesozoic and subsequently developed into an intracontinental tectonic process during late Mesozoic. Field investigations identified the presence of late Mesozoic basalts in the Duofutun and Hongqiang areas in the western Qinling orogenic belt. The petrogenesis of these basalts provides an important constraint on the late Mesozoic geodynamics of the orogen. The representative basaltic samples yield the Ar-40/Ar-39 plateau age of about 112 Ma. These samples belong to the alkaline series and have SiO2 ranging from 44.98 wt.% to 48.19 wt. %, Na2O + K2O from 3.44 wt% to 5.44 wt%, and MgO from 7.25 wt.% to 12.19 wt.%. They demonstrate the right-sloping chondrite-normalized REE patterns with negligible Eu anomalies (1.00-1.10) and PM-normalized patterns enriched in light rare earth element, large ion lithophile element and high field strength element, similar to those of OIB rocks. These samples additionally show an OIB-like Sr-Nd isotopic signature with epsilon(Nd)(t) values ranging from + 6.13 to +10.15 and initial Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios from 0.7028 to 0.7039, respectively. These samples are geochemically subdivided into two groups. Group 1 is characterized by low Al2O3 and high TiO2 and P2O5 contents, as well as high La/Yb ratios (> 20), being the product of the high-pressure garnet fractionation from the OIB-derived magma. Group 2 shows higher Al2O3 but lower P205 contents and La/Yb ratios (< 20) than Group 1, originating from asthenospheric mantle with input of delaminated lithospheric component. In combination with available data, it is proposed for the petrogenetic model of the Early Cretaceous thickened lithospheric delamination in response to the asthenospheric upwelling along the western Qinling orogenic belt.

AB Lacustrine beach-bar reservoirs have become important exploration targets in the Bohai Bay Basin in China, especially in the Banqiao Sag within the Huanghua Depression, where some typical thick layer beach-bar reservoirs have been discovered recently. The average single-layer thickness of the beach-bar sand bodies in the second member of the Paleogene Shahejie Formation within the sag is greater than 10 m and the cumulative thickness of these sands reach up to 100 m. The second member of the Shahejie Formation in the Banqiao Sag consists of a third-order sequence of three systems tracts - a lowstand systems tract, a transgressive systems tract, and a highstand systems tract. Beach-bar sand bodies were deposited widely in the sag in the lowstand systems tract, but were less deposited in the other systems tracts. The sedimentary characteristics, distribution patterns, and formation mechanisms of the beach-bar sand bodies in the lowstand systems tract of the second member of the Shahejie Formation were systemically studied using cores, wireline logs and 3D seismic data. The beach-bar was divided into five sedimentary microfacies, namely, sandy bar centre, sandy bar flank, interbar deposit, coastal beach, and infralittoral beach. Based on the integrated analysis of the paleostructure and sedimentary environment, it was inferred that the thick layer beach-bars in this area resulted from the combination and joint control of the sediment source system, hydrodynamic environment, lake level variations, and contemporaneous fault activity. Firstly, the sands in the braided river delta of the Beidagang buried hill structural belt served as the provenance that provided the material basis for the beach-bars in the Banqiao Sag. Secondly, the wave effects in the gentle-slope belt controlled the scale and distribution of the beach bars. Under the control of waves, various sedimentary microfacies were regularly distributed. In particular, the continuous activity of the contemporaneous Dazhangtuo Fault contributed to the formation of the thick layer beach-bars in the Banqiao Sag. The contemporaneous fault controlled the allocation of the sediments, providing abundant sands in the down thrown side of the fault. In addition, there was a constant high-energy hydrodynamic environment near the fault plane, where the sand bodies experienced long-term reworking by waves and gradually formed beach-bars with large thickness. The activity of the contemporaneous fault increased the accommodation space in the lowstand systems tract of the second member of the Shahejie Formation, which resulted in continuous sand deposition and provided the necessary conditions for forming the thick layer beach-bars.

AB Statistics about the occurrence frequency of earthquakes (1973-2015) at shallow, intermediate and great depths along the Izu-Bonin-Mariana (IBM) Arc is presented and a percent perturbation relative to P-wave mean value (LLNL-G3Dv3) is adopted to show the deep structure. The correlation coefficient between the subduction rate and the frequency of shallow seismic events along the IBM is 0.605, proving that the subduction rate is an important factor for shallow seismic events. The relationship between relief amplitudes of the seafloor and earthquake occurrences implies that some seamount chains riding on the Pacific seafloor may have an effect on intermediate-depth seismic events along the IBM. A probable hypothesis is proposed that the seamounts or surrounding seafloor with high degree of fracture may bring numerous hydrous minerals into the deep and may result in a different thermal structure compared to the seafloor where no seamounts are subducted. Fluids from the seamounts or surrounding seafloor are released to trigger earthquakes at intermediate-depth. Deep events in the northern and southern Mariana arc are likely affected by a horizontal propagating tear parallel to the trench.

AB Early Neoproterozoic tectonics of the Yangtze block remains poorly understood because very limited igneous records are available from the time interval of similar to 1000-870 Ma. In this paper, our new SIMS U Pb dating results demonstrate that the Liushudian mafic intrusion and Pinghe alkaline complex in the northwest Yangtze block were emplaced at 888 +/- 6 Ma and 891 +/- 7 Ma, respectively, representing the products of a similar to 890 Ma igneous event. Gabbros from the Liushudian intrusion have rather depleted zircon epsilon Hf(t) (mean = 10.4) and normal mantle-like zircon delta O-18 (mean = 5.97 parts per thousand). Their parental magma was thus probably derived from asthenospheric mantle. Geochemically, these mafic rocks have an affinity to continental flood tholeiitic basalts rather than ocean island basalts, as previously thought. In contrast, an ijolite sample from the Pinghe complex has less depleted zircon epsilon Hf(t) (mean = 5.7) and anomalously high zircon and apatite delta O-18 (mean = 13.76 parts per thousand and 13.80 parts per thousand, respectively). Such a characteristic delta O-18 signal, among the highest yet known for igneous zircons, could be either inherited from a magma source in metasomatized lithospheric mantle or acquired by assimilation of high-delta O-18 supracrustal materials (e.g., limestone, chert) during magma evolution. An intra-plate extensional environment is suggested for the similar to 890 Ma igneous event in the northwest Yangtze block, although it is as yet unclear whether this igneous event is related to a mantle plume or not. It could be concluded that magmatism on the western periphery of the Yangtze block was not shut down between similar to 1000 and similar to 870 Ma, and the similar to 890 Ma intra-plate igneous event may mark either the onset of Neoproterozoic continental rifting or the ending of Late Mesoproterozoic to Early Neoproterozoic lithospheric extension.

AB We have studied the petrography, geochemistry, and detrital zircon U-Pb ages of sandstones from shallow marine forearc sediments, accretionary complexes (ACs), and metamorphosed accretionary complexes (Meta-ACs) within the Kurosegawa belt of Southwest Japan. Those rocks formed in a forearc region of a Permian island arc associated with subduction of the Panthalassa oceanic crust along the eastern margin of the South China block (Yangtze block). The provenance of the shallow-marine sediments was dominated by basaltic to andesitic volcanic rocks and minor granitic rocks during the late Middle to Late Permian. The ACs were derived from felsic to andesitic volcanic rocks during the Late Permian. The provenance of Meta-ACs was dominated by andesitic volcanic rocks in the Middle Permian. The provenance, source rock compositions, and zircon age distribution for the forearc sediments, ACs and Meta-ACs have allowed us to reconstruct the geological history of the Permian arc system of the Kurosegawa belt. During the Middle Permian, the ACs were accreted along the eastern margin of the South China block. The Middle Permian arc was an immature oceanic island arc consisting of andesitic volcanic rocks. During the Late Permian, the ACs formed in a mature arc, producing voluminous felsic to andesitic volcanic rocks. A forearc basin developed during the late Middle to Late Permian. Subsequently, the Middle Permian ACs and part of the Late Permian AC underwent low-grade metamorphism in the Late to Early Jurassic, presenting the Meta-ACs.

AB The Fodongmo-Hongyazi fault (FHF) is a major thrust of Northeastern Tibet, bounding the Qilian Shan. It accommodates crustal shortening across this region and has produced a strong historical earthquake. Until now the slip rate has been poorly constrained, limiting our understanding of its role in the accommodation of deformation across this region. In this paper, faulted terraces at two sites on the western and middle segments of the FHF were mapped with satellite imagery and field observations. Chronological constraints are placed on the ages of displaced river terraces at these sites using terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide (TCN) exposure dating. These ages combined with offsets measured from SPOT 6 DEM's yield average vertical slip rates of 1.3 +/- 0.1 mm/yr for the western segment since similar to 207 ka and 0.9 +/- 0.1 mm/yr since similar to 46 ka for the middle segment. These data suggest that the FHF accommodates similar to 15-20% of the total shortening across the Qilian Shan (5.5-7 nun/yr). In addition, comparisons of our data with published slip rates along the Northern Qilian Thrust Fault Zone show that the fastest tectonic uplift occurs along the western portion of the Northern Qilian Shan. This is consistent with estimates deduced from geomorphology. The western portion of the Qilian Shan is mainly controlled by compressional deformation produced by the northward movement of the Northeastern Tibetan Plateau, while the eastern Qilian Shan is mainly controlled by the eastward extrusion of material along the left -lateral Haiyuan strike -slip Fault.

TI Spatiotemporal distribution of low-frequency earthquakes in Southwest

AB Low-frequency earthquakes (LFEs) in the lower crust and uppermost mantle are widely observed in Southwest Japan, and they occur not only along the subducting Philippine Sea (PHS) slab interface but also beneath active arc volcanoes. The volcanic LFEs are still not well understood because of their limited quantities and less reliable hypocenter locations. In this work, seismic tomography is used to determine detailed three-dimensional (3-D) P and S-wave velocity (Vp and Vs) models of the crust and upper mantle beneath Southwest Japan, and then the obtained 3-D Vp and Vs models are used to relocate the volcanic LFEs precisely. The results show that the volcanic LFEs can be classified into two types: pipe-like and swarm-like LFEs, and both of them are located in or around zones of low-velocity and high-Poisson's ratio anomalies in the crust and uppermost mantle beneath the active volcanoes. The pipe-like LFEs may be related to the fluid migration from the lower crust or the uppermost mantle, whereas the swarm-like LFEs may be related to local magmatic activities or small magma chambers. The number of LFEs sometimes increases sharply before or after a nearby large crustal earthquake which may cause cracks and fluid migration. The spatiotemporal distribution of the LFEs may indicate the track of migrating fluids. As compared with the tectonic LFEs along the PHS slab interface, the volcanic LFEs are more sensitive to fluid migration and local magmatic activities. High pore pressures play an important role in triggering both types of LFEs in Southwest Japan.

AB New apatite fission track (AFT) dating was applied to the Xuefeng Mt. Range and Yuanma Basin to constrain the Cenozoic exhumation process of the southeastern Yangtze Block, South China. The analyzed samples in this study have AFT ages ranging from 27.9 +/- 2.5 to 61.5 +/- 5.9 Ma, which are younger than the deposition or crystallization ages of the host rocks. The AFT analysis and thermal history modeling indicate that both the Xuefeng Mt. Range and the Yuanma Basin underwent significant exhumation during the early Cenozoic (ca. 60-40 Ma). These samples were rapidly exhumed to near the surface during this period. Our results suggest that an important tectonic event occurred along or near regional fault zones (e.g., the Qinhang Fault) in South China during the early Cenozoic (ca. 60-40 Ma). However, it is difficult to relate this event to the Eastern Sichuan fold belt, which is much older and is characterized by large-scale folding and thrusting. Combined with fieldwork in the Yuanma, Xupu, and Xinning basins, we refute the Cretaceous "Pan-Yangtze Basin" that was proposed to have been separated by the uplifted Xuefeng Mt. Range after the Late Cretaceous. The exhumation stage from ca. 60 Ma to 40 Ma was an important period during which plate movements across the eastern Asian and Pacific regions were reorganized. The early Cenozoic tectonothermal event in South China can be attributed to a change in the direction and speed of the subduction of the Pacific Plate beneath the Eurasian Plate. An Oligocene Miocene cooling event was also recorded in the eastern Xuefeng Mt. Range, which we tentatively attribute to the activity of dextral faults in this area as a far-field effect of the collision between the Indian and Eurasian plates.

AB To investigate the magnitude to which the carbon isotopic ratio (delta C-13) varies in coals in response to their contemporary terrestrial environment, the Early-Middle Permian Huainan coals (including coals from the Shanxi Formation, Lower Shihezi Formation and Upper Shihezi Formation) in North China were systematically sampled. A 2.5 parts per thousand variation range of delta C-13 values (-25.15%o to -22.65%o) was observed in Huainan coals, with an average value of -24.06 parts per thousand. As coal diagenesis exerts little influence on carbon isotope fractionation, delta C-13 values in coals were mainly imparted by those of coal -forming flora assemblages which were linked to the contemporary climate. The delta C-13 values in coals from the Shanxi and Lower Shihezi Formations are variable, reflecting unstable climatic oscillations. Heavy carbon isotope is enriched in coals of the Capitanian Upper Shihezi Formation, implying a shift to high positive delta C-13 values of coeval atmospheric CO2. Notably, our study provides evidence of the Kamura event in the terrestrial environment for the first time.

AB The Yilan-Yitong Fault Zone (YYFZ), which is composed of two nearly parallel branches with a spacing of 5-30 km and a length of similar to 1100 km, is considered to be the key branch of the Tancheng-Lujiang Fault Zone (TLFZ) in NE China. It was traditionally believed that the YYFZ experienced weak activity or was inactive during the Late Quaternary, without the capability to generate strong earthquakes (M >= 7), based on the absence of typical outcrops and large historical or instrumental earthquakes (M > 6). However, our paleoseismic study shows that the YYFZ is the primary seismotectonic structure (M >= 7) that poses significant earthquake threats to NE China. The synthesis of data collected from geologic investigations, geomorphic mapping, trench logging and the dating of samples indicates that the YYFZ is an active structure that has undergone segmented strong tectonic deformation since the Late Quaternary with a characteristic assemblage of landforms, including linear scarps and troughs, offset or deflected streams, linear sag ponds, small horsts and grabens. The latest ruptures of the YYFZ migrated from previous boundary faults into the basin interior, forming a left-stepping en echelon pattern in plain view, and the kinematics of these events in the Late Quaternary were dominated by reverse dextral slipping. Multi-segment cluster faulting might have occurred during three cluster periods, i.e., similar to 34750-35812 a BP, similar to 21700-22640 a BP, and similar to 4000 a BP-present, which implies that the recurrence interval of large earthquakes along the YYFZ may be as long as tens of thousands of years.

AB To understand historical climate change in western Pacific coastal areas, a sediment core (SOJ-2) from the"stable sedimentary environment of the Songjiho Lagoon on the east coast of South Korea was obtained for centennial resolution palynological analysis. The ages of the SOJ-2 core is well controlled' by carbon 14 dating with high resolution accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS), and the results indicated a general warm to cold climate trend from the mid-Holocene to the present, which can be divided into two different stages: a warmer stage between 6842 and 1297 cal yr BP and a colder stage from 1297 cal yr BP to, the present, with fluctuations during these stages. The climate was wetter from 6842 to 6227 cal yr BP and 4520 to 1297 cal yr BP and was drier from 6227 to 4520 cal yr BP. The climate changed to cold and dry during the period from 1297-425 cal yr BP. The impact of human activity on the climate began at approximately 1297 cal yr BP and became pronounced starting in 425 cal yr BP. The general cooling trend may represent a response to decreasing solar insolation; however, the relative dryness or wetness of the climate may have been co-determined by westerlies and the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM). The climate had a teleconnection with the North Atlantic region, resulting from changes in solar activity. Nevertheless, EI Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) activity played an important role in impacting the EASM changes in western Pacific coastal areas.

AB Source parameters of the Bay of Bengal earthquake of 21 May 2014 have been studied using full waveform inversion. Its source mechanism thus determined the orientation of the strike slip faulting as NW-SE/NE-SW. The occurrence of past earthquakes along the NE-SW nodal plane suggested its preference as the main fault which could result from the transmission of stresses from the Indian plate boundary. High stress drop of this earthquake (216 bar) is attributed to its location in the intraplate region, strike slip faulting and focus in the colder upper mantle. Comparison of the stress drop of deeper focus Hindukush earthquakes with that of the Bay of Bengal earthquake showed a smaller felt radius due to fractured lithosphere in the Himalayas vis-a-vis more efficient propagation of seismic waves in the peninsular region from the source region of this recent earthquake. The seismological evidence presented for the 85 degrees E and 90 degrees E ridges shows the predominance of strike slip faulting with thrusting on both the ridges. Integrating their source mechanism with that of the May 2014 earthquake, it could be inferred that the Bay of Bengal region (excluding Andaman Sumatra subduction zone) is characterised predominantly by strike slip faulting in the region north of latitude 20 degrees N and strike slip with thrusting in the remaining portion.

AB Collapsible soils go through three distinct phases in response to metric suction decrease during wetting: pre collapse phase, collapse phase and post-collapse phase. It is reasonable and conservative to consider a strain path that includes a pre-collapse phase in which constant volume is maintained and a collapse phase that extends to the final metric suction to be experienced by collapsible soils during wetting. Upon this assumption, a method is proposed for predicting the collapse behaviour due to wetting. To use the proposed method, two parameters, critical suction and collapse rate, are required. The former is the suction value below which significant collapse deformations take place in response to matric suction decease, and the later is the rate at which void ratio reduces with metric suction in the collapse phase. The value of critical suction can be estimated from the water entry value taking account of both the microstructure characteristics and collapse mechanism of fine-grained collapsible soils; the wetting soil-water characteristic curve thus can be used as a tool. Five sets of data of wetting tests on both compacted and natural collapsible soils reported in the literature were used to validate the proposed method. The critical suction values were estimated from the water-entry value with parameter a that is suggested to vary between 0.10 and 0.25 for compacted soils and to be lower for natural collapsible soils. The results of a field permeation test in collapsible loess soils were also used to validate the proposed method. The relatively good agreement between the measured and estimated collapse deformations suggests that the proposed method can provide reasonable prediction of the collapse behaviour due to wetting.

AB The Zoige depression is an important depocenter within the northeast Songpan-Ganzi flysch basin, which is bounded by the South China, North China and Qiangtang Blocks and forms the northeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau. This paper discusses the sediment provenance and Mesozoic-Cenozoic evolution of the Zoige depression in the Songpan-Ganzi flysch basin, eastern Tibetan Plateau, using the detrital zircon U-Pb ages and apatite fission-track data from the Middle to Late Triassic sedimentary rocks in the area. The U-Pb ages of the Middle to Late Triassic zircons range from 260-280 Ma, 429-480 Ma, 792-974 Ma and 1800-2500 Ma and represent distinct source region. Our new results demonstrate that the detritus deposited during the Middle Triassic (Ladinian, T(2)zg) primarily originated from the Eastern Kunlun and North Qinling Orogens, with lesser contributions from the North China Block. By the Late Triassic (early Carnian, T(3)z), the materials at the southern margin of the North China Block were generally transported westward to the basin along a river network that flowed through the Qinling region between the North China and South China Blocks: this interpretation is supported by the predominance of the bimodal distribution of 1.8 Ga and 2.5 Ga age peaks and a lack of significant Neoproterozoic zircon. Since the Late Triassic (middle Carnian, T(3)zh), considerable changes have occurred in the source terranes, such as the cessation of the Eastern Kunlun Orogen and North China Block sources and the rise of the northwestern margin of the Yangtze Block and South Qinling Orogen. These drastic changes are compatible with a model of a sustained westward collision between the South China and North China Blocks during the late Triassic and the clockwise rotation of the South China Block progressively closed the basin. Subsequently, orogeny-associated folds have formed in the basin since the Late Triassic (late Carnian), and the study area was generally subjected to uplifting and cooling stages during 200-160 Ma, 90-120 Ma, 20-40 Ma and 10 Ma as evidenced by the apatite fission track data and the thermal history modeling. According to the regional background, we conclude that these stages are as follows, from oldest to youngest: the E-W extrusion across the entire Chinese mainland at the beginning of the Yanshanian period (200-160 Ma), the interaction among the North China, Yangtze and India plates during the Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous, the collision between the Indian and Eurasian plates since the Paleogene, and the rapid uplift simultaneous with the formation of the Tibetan Plateau since 10 Ma.

AB To provide a comprehensive palaeoenvironmental reconstruction based on larger benthic foraminifera (LBF), a quantitative analysis of their assemblage composition is needed. Besides microfacies analysis which includes environmental preferences of foraminiferal taxa, statistical analyses should also be employed. Therefore, de-trended correspondence analysis and cluster analysis were performed on relative abundance data of identified LBF assemblages deposited in mixed carbonate-siliciclastic (MCS) systems and blue-water (BW) settings. Studied MCS system localities include ten sections from the central part of the Kutai Basin in East Kalimantan, ranging from late Burdigalian to Serravallian age. The BW samples were collected from eleven sections of the Bulu Formation on Central Java, dated as Serravallian. Results from detrended correspondence analysis reveal significant differences between these two environmental settings. Cluster analysis produced five clusters of samples; clusters 1 and 2 comprise dominantly MCS samples, clusters 3 and 4 with dominance of BW samples, and cluster 5 showing a mixed composition with both MCS and BW samples. The results of cluster analysis were afterwards subjected to indicator species analysis resulting in the interpretation that generated three groups among LBF taxa: typical assemblage indicators, regularly occurring taxa and rare taxa. By interpreting the results of de-trended correspondence analysis, cluster analysis and indicator species analysis, along with environmental preferences of identified LBF taxa, a palaeoenvironmental model is proposed for the distribution of LBF in Miocene MCS systems and adjacent BW settings of Indonesia.

AB This study reports new crinoid material, which is identified as Muicrinus dawanensis new genus and new species from South China, representing the oldest known iocrinid in the world. These new fossils, which are characterized by bearing simple primibrachials and a helically coiled column, are from the lower-middle part of the Dawan Formation, which ranges from the upper Floian (Lower Ordovician) to the lower Dapingian (Middle Ordovician) (similar to 470 Ma). A total of 11 related taxa with 80 characters were selected to conduct phylogenetic analyses. Our results indicated that South China specimens are closely related to ones that are endemic to Laurentia. Synapomorphies shared between species in those two cratons include elongate supraradial plates and isotomous arm branching. Furthermore, the phylogenetic closeness of endemic taxa that only occurred in two cratons leads us to suggest a geographic connection between those regions during deep time. Combining biogeographic evidence reported from Cambrian studies, this study supports the "missing-link" configuration of Rodinia during the breakup phase. Based on the crinoid global biodiversity pattern updated here, the potential for discovery of new Paleozoic crinoid faunas in China is very high.

AB Crustal seismic velocity structure was determined for the northern Taiwan using seismic travel-time data to investigate the northeastern extension of the northern South China Sea's high-magnetic belt. In order to increase the model resolution, a joint analysis of gravity anomaly and seismic travel-time data have been conducted. A total of 3385 events had been used in the inversion that was collected by the Central Weather Bureau Seismological Network from 1990 to 2015. The main features of the obtained three-dimensional velocity model are: (1) a relatively high Vp zone with velocity greater than 6.5 km/s is observed in the middle to lower crust, (2) the high Vp zone generally parallels to the north south structural trending of the Chuchih fault and Hsuehshan Range, (3) at 25 km depth-slice, the high Vp zone shows structural trends change from northeastward to northward in central Taiwan, where the values of high-magnetic anomalies are rapidly decreasing to low values. A combination of seismic, GPS, and structural interpretations suggests that the entire crust has been deformed and demagnetized in consequence of the collision between the Philippine Sea plate and the Asian continental margin. We suggest that the feature of sharp bending of the high Vp zone would migrate southwestward and cause further crustal deformation of the Peikang High in the future.

AB Structural interpretation of 2-D seismic reflection data and subsurface-outcrop correlations reveal six distinct phases of deformation recorded in the Paleozoic basement rocks and Mesozoic-Cenozoic basin fill of the East Gobi Basin (EGB), southeastern Mongolia. These phases include arc accretion and arc-continent collision in late Paleozoic time, Late Triassic sinistral shear-zone development, Early Jurassic fold and thrust belt style shortening, Middle Jurassic Lower Cretaceous extension and rift basin development, middle Cretaceous shortening with basin inversion and regional unconformity development, and Late Cretaceous-Oligocene thermal subsidence with renewed Paleogene left-lateral strike slip faulting across the fault zone. The five post-amalgamation deformation phases are localized along the East Gobi Fault Zone, suggesting that preexisting structures and boundary conditions exert fundamental controls on the long term evolution of intracontinental basins such as the EGB. Subsurface geophysical data and outcrop correlations demonstrate that the main subbasins of the EGB contain major differences in basement metamorphic and structural fabrics, basin fill patterns, and distinct Mesozoic-Cenozoic fault generations. Potential causes related to far-field boundary conditions and other driving factors are suggested for each of the major deformation phases.

DE Excision; Injection; Pyoktanin blue; Spinal arachnoid cyst
AB BACKGROUND: Spinal arachnoid cysts (SACs) are filled with cerebrospinal fluid, and they include the arachnoid membrane, making it difficult to distinguish the walls of the cyst from the arachnoid membrane and excise the cyst as a lump. Here we report a technique for the intraoperative visualization of SACs, involving the use of pyoktanin blue.
   METHODS: Four patients with spinal intradural arachnoid cysts underwent total excision of the cysts between October 2016 and April 2017. In 1 case, magnetic resonance imaging revealed the cyst clearly, but in the other cases, the cysts were unclear. All cystswere injected with 1% pyoktanin blue (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan) diluted 500 times with physiological saline before excision. When itwas difficult to distinguish the cyst from the normal arachnoid membrane, 1% pyoktanin blue diluted 1000 times with physiological saline was injected into both the cyst and the subarachnoid space, and the spread of the stain was observed.
   RESULTS: The cysts were better visualized after pyoktanin blue injection than before injection. When it was difficult to distinguish the cyst from the normal arachnoid space, pyoktanin blue injection was useful for judging the cyst space. There were no perioperative complications, and the patients' symptoms improved partially or completely after treatment.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our technique of pyoktanin blue injection into SACs could make their excision easy and safe.

   ARTICLE
AB BACKGROUND: Many retrospective studies of pedicle screw placement have revealed that intraoperative navigation systems provide higher accuracy rates and safety than do free-hand techniques. The accuracy of various image-guided navigation systems has been studied; however, differences have not been well defined due to the lack of adequate evidence-based comparative studies.
   OBJECTIVE: A meta-analysis was conducted to focus on the variation in pedicle screw insertion among 3 navigation systems: a 3-dimensional fluoroscopy-based navigation system (3D FluoroNav), a 2-dimensional fluoroscopy-based navigation system (2D FluoroNav), and a conventional computed tomography navigation system (CT Nav).
   METHODS: We screened for comparative studies on different pedicle screw insertion navigation systems published through January 2017 using the Cochrane Library, Ovid, Web of Science, PubMed, and EMBASE databases.
   RESULTS: From 125 papers that were identified, 10 articles were finally chosen. The present comparative study included 8 retrospective clinical studies, 1 prospective clinical trial, and 1 randomized controlled cadaveric study. The prevalence rate of pedicle violation in the 3D FluoroNav group was significantly lower than the rates of the 2D FluoroNav group (relative risk [RR] 95%, confidence interval [CI]: 0.16-0.61, P < 0.01) and the CT Nav group (RR 95%, CI: 0.42-0.90, P = 0.01), and the rate of the CT Nav group was significantly lower than that of the 2D FluoroNav group (RR 95%, CI: 0.29-0.81, P < 0.01).
   CONCLUSION: Significant differences exist among CT Nav, 3D FluoroNav, and 2D FluoroNav. Our review suggests that 3D FluoroNav may be superior to the other 2 methods in reducing pedicle violation and that clinicians should consider 3D FluoroNav as a better choice.

AB BACKGROUND: Colloid cyst is a gelatin-containing cyst in the brain almost always found in the third ventricle. The specific shape and location of these cysts, a round well-delineated mass in the rostral part of the third ventricle adjacent to the foramen of Monro, on imaging are the main findings for diagnosis. Several masses of the third ventricle masquerading colloid cysts on images have been reported. Based on different surgical approaches, preoperative misdiagnosis of colloid cyst may have great impact on prognosis.
   METHODS: We report 2 cases that presented with severe headache and hydrocephalus, and their preoperative images were highly indicative of colloid cyst.
   RESULTS: Histopathologic investigations after tumor resection showed pilocytic astrocytoma of fornix in both cases.
   CONCLUSIONS: Fifteen cases of colloid cyst misdiagnosis with other masses have been reported thus far; among them, 2 cases were pilocytic astrocytoma. In this study we report 2 other cases. Furthermore, we discuss additional clues helping to differentiate pilocytic astrocytoma from colloid cyst on images.

AB BACKGROUND: Keyhole craniotomy is a type of pterional craniotomy that involves a minimally invasive approach for the treatment of cerebral aneurysms. Currently, the minipterional keyhole craniotomy and supraorbital keyhole craniotomy procedures are frequently performed.
   METHODS: We evaluated the feasibility and safety of supraorbital keyhole craniotomies and minipterional keyhole craniotomy for the clipping of ruptured intracranial aneurysms in the anterior cerebral circulation as an alternative to the pterional approach in a consecutive series of 25 patients.
   RESULTS: The rate of intraoperative aneurysmal rupture was 8% ( 2/25), and all ruptures were safely controlled.
   CONCLUSION: The success solely depends on careful selection of patients and the experience of the surgical team.

AB BACKGROUND: Various techniques have been used for wrap-clipping a ruptured, fusiform intracranial aneurysm; however, there is no available literature on use of the falx cerebri for wrap-clipping. We present a review of the literature, with an illustrative case, of a ruptured fusiform pericallosal artery aneurysm firmly attached to the lower edge of the falx cerebri and not amenable to endovascular intervention.
   METHODS: Although the firm attachment between the inferior falx and the fusiform aneurysm was maintained, a section of the lower thinner part of the falx cerebri firmly attached to the aneurysm was dissected and wrapped around the fusiform aneurysm, and then stabilized with a fenestrated clip. We chose a segment slightly longer than the length of the fusiform aneurysm to avoid pree and postewrap-clipping stenosis.
   RESULTS: Postprocedure, except for a small area of numbness on the left distal anterolateral left leg, the patient was neurologically intact and remained neurologically intact at a 12-month follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: An inferior thin segment of the falx cerebri can be used for wrap-clipping of ruptured fusiform anterior cerebral artery aneurysms. Furthermore, the inferior falx can be wrapped around the attached fusiform anterior cerebral artery aneurysm without compromising flow, offering a safe solution in these unusually complex cases.

AB BACKGROUND: Two-dimensional radiographic methods have been proposed to evaluate the radiographic outcome after indirect decompression through extreme lateral interbody fusion (XLIF). However, the assessment of neural decompression in a single plane may underestimate the effect of indirect decompression on central canal and foraminal volumes. The present study aimed to assess the reliability and consistency of a novel 3-dimensional radiographic method that assesses neural decompression by volumetric analysis using a new generation of intraoperative fan-beam computed tomography scanner in patients undergoing XLIF.
   METHODS: Prospectively collected data from 7 patients (9 levels) undergoing XLIF was retrospectively analyzed. Three independent, blind raters using imaging analysis software performed volumetric measurements pre- and postoperatively to determine central canal and foraminal volumes. Intrarater and Interrater reliability tests were performed to assess the reliability of this novel volumetric method.
   RESULTS: The interrater reliability between the three raters ranged from 0.800 to 0.952, P < 0.0001. The test-retest analysis on a randomly selected subset of three patients showed good to excellent internal reliability (range of 0.78-1.00) for all 3 raters. There was a significant increase in mean volume approximate to 20% for right foramen, left foramen, and central canal volumes postoperatively (P = 0.0472; P = 0.0066; P = 0.0003, respectively).
   CONCLUSIONS: Here we demonstrate a new volumetric analysis technique that is feasible, reliable, and reproducible amongst independent raters for central canal and foraminal volumes in the lumbar spine using an intraoperative computed tomography scanner.

   MANAGEMENT; CANCER
AB BACKGROUND: The treatment of spinal metastasis consists of algorithms combining surgical and radiation modalities. Recently the concept of separation surgery followed by stereotactic radiosurgery was shown to be a safe and effective treatment to achieve local tumor control.
   OBJECTIVE: We examined a minimally invasive approach to separation surgery in a cadaveric study followed by a patient cohort with spinal metastasis using navigation to discuss our results and provide a technical note.
   METHODS: A cadaveric study using minimally invasive access systems examined the feasibility of spinal cord decompression. Subsequently, 17 patients with spinal metastasis underwent minimally invasive separation surgery and instrumentation using navigation. All patients were at least 3/5 and pre- and post-operative CT scans were used to evaluate the decompression. Endpoints included neurologic function, operative time, estimated blood loss, duration of hospital stay, and complications.
   RESULTS: The cadaveric study demonstrated adequate decompression of the spinal cord. For the operative cases, the post-operative imaging demonstrated excellent separation for safe stereotactic radiosurgery. The mean incision length was 4.9 cm. The average operative time was 6 hours and 48 minutes, the mean length of stay was 12.8 days and the mean surgical blood loss was 458 mL. The median Spine Instability Neoplastic Score score was 10 with a range of 6-16. All patients remained or improved their neurologic baseline with excellent pain control. One patient incurred a perioperative complication.
   CONCLUSIONS: Minimally invasive separation surgery for spinal metastasis allows for circumferential decompression of the spinal cord and safe post-operative stereotactic radiosurgery. In addition, we demonstrated the efficacy of intra-operative navigation in guiding the resection.

ID RECONSTRUCTION
AB BACKGROUND: With recent advances in endovascular devices and techniques, the use of endovascular treatment has been reported for intracranial dissecting aneurysms. However, the efficacy of this endovascular approach for intracranial dissection is still unknown. We report the case of a patient with a recurrent anterior cerebral artery (ACA) dissecting aneurysm after endovascular treatment.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 67-year-old woman underwent stent-assisted coil embolization for a ruptured ACA dissecting aneurysm of the left A2 segment. Aneurysmal dilatation was completely occluded after embolization. However, follow-up angiography 40 days after treatment showed compaction of the coil mass and reenlargement of the aneurysm. Open surgery was performed, considering the risk of rebleeding from the recurrent dissecting aneurysm. A3-A3 anastomosis followed by trapping of the coiled aneurysm along with the stent was successfully performed through the interhemispheric approach. The postoperative course was uneventful, and angiography 6 months after surgery revealed disappearance of the aneurysm and patency of the A3-A3 anastomosis.
   CONCLUSIONS: Stent-assisted coil embolization for an ACA dissecting aneurysm may not be curative, and the coiled aneurysm may recur within a short time period. Microsurgical bypass trapping can be considered as the alterative or salvage treatment because of curability. Revascularization surgery, such as A3-A3 anastomosis, should be performed before trapping to avoid ischemic complications.

AB BACKGROUND: Primary moyamoya disease associated with skull base tumors has been reported only rarely in the literature. Surgical treatment can be complicated due to the compensatory collateral circulation through meningeal and leptomeningeal anastomosis. A standard frontotemporal craniotomy may interrupt critical transdural anastomoses.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a case of primary moyamoya disease coexisting with tuberculum sellae meningioma and left cavernous sinus hemangioma. Simultaneous management of tuberculum sellae meningioma and moyamoya disease was performed using a left modified pterional incision. Two separate bone windows were opened to protect the transdural anastomosis via the middle meningeal artery. The tuberculum sellae meningioma was successfully removed through a small frontal craniotomy, and encephaloduromyosynangiosis was used to treat moyamoya disease through a temporoparietal craniotomy. Finally, CyberKnife radiotherapy was used to treat the left cavernous sinus hemangioma at 6 weeks after the initial operation. The patient recovered well without complications. This is the first report of moyamoya disease associated with tuberculum sellae meningioma and cavernous sinus hemangioma.
   CONCLUSIONS: With careful bone flap design, moyamoya disease and skull base tumors can be treated simultaneously. Care should be taken to avoid interruption of critical dural-pial collaterals and injury to fragile moyamoya vessels.

TI Evaluating the Effectiveness and the Impact of Donated Neurosurgical
   Equipment on Neurosurgical Units in Low- and Middle-Income Countries:

SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article

ID SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA; NEED; SITUATION; BARRIERS; CARE
AB BACKGROUND: Surgical practice highly depends on the availability of surgical equipment; this is particularly relevant to low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where resources are limited. A key part of the efforts to improve surgical provision globally include providing affordable equipment to LMICs; however, the effectiveness and the impact of these initiatives have not yet been assessed. We aimed to evaluate the World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies neurosurgical equipment program in this context.
   METHODS: Recipients were identified from the World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies records; contact details were gathered. An online survey was used to collect data on equipment, including its current use, any malfunctioning issues, suitability, reliability, serviceability, and the impact it has had on the unit.
   RESULTS: Responses were received from 16 units, totaling 28 pieces of equipment. A total of 75% of the equipment is still in use; of this, 57% is fully functioning, and 43% is used despite some malfunction. We found that 25% of the equipment is broken and unusable; high-maintenance items, such as high-speed drills, feature in this category (100% broken, n = 3). Units reported an increase in number of operation performed in 74% cases, improved surgery quality in 78%, and breadth of operations in 44%. Satisfaction, equipment suitability, reliability, and serviceability scored highly, with median values of 9 for all fields on a 10-point scale.
   CONCLUSIONS: Equipment donation positively impacts neurosurgical units in LMICs by allowing expansion of neurosurgical practice, improved safety and quality, and affordability. Adequate follow-up, considerations regarding equipment durability and maintenance needs, and improved support for repairs should be prioritized to ensure maximal benefit.

AB OBJECTIVE: We report the availability of a newly developed, malleable, tin-alloyed omnidirectional retractorsupporting (OD) ring for steady and safe ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt laparotomy.
   METHODS: The OD ring is principally circular in shape, 15 cm in diameter, and is sufficiently malleable to be fitted to the abdominal wall. There are 22 outward protrusions 12 mm in length that are welded to the outside of the ring at regular intervals. The OD ring with twisted rubber bands attached around the protrusions is placed on the abdominal wall surrounding the skin incision. Then the edge is omnidirectionally retracted with blunt minihooks attached to the rubber bands. In our hospital from January 2016 to February 2017, 15 consecutive patients underwent a VP shunt procedure using the OD ring.
   RESULTS: In a VP shunt procedure, our malleable, tin-alloyed OD ring could be smoothly placed on various types of abdominal walls. Moreover, our OD ring system provided a wider and shallower operative field allowing omnidirectional retraction during small laparotomy. Additionally, the OD ring system did not interfere with our surgical manipulations.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our newly developed retraction system with a malleable, tin-alloyed OD ring and minihooks may allow safe and steady small laparotomy for VP shunt.

A 20-year-old male presented with progressive osphyalgia with constipation. Contrasted magnetic resonance imaging showed multiple vertebrae of hypointense T1 signals and an intraspinal epidural lesion. Subtotal resection was achieved. Histopathology suggested malignant B-cell lymphoma with Ki-67 of 90% and positivity of leukocyte common antigen. A bone marrow biopsy was unequivocally diagnostic of B-cell acute lymphoblastic lymphoma followed by chemotherapy (methotrexate) and partial recovery was observed. The marrow biopsy was necessary if without hypercalcemia and abnormal peripheral blood examination.

   FLOW DYNAMICS; ASPECT RATIO
AB BACKGROUND: Recently, with improvements in computed tomography angiography and digital subtraction angiography, the assessment of certain morphologic traits of anterior communicating artery aneurysms (ACoAA) has drawn great attention. The determination of specific factors associated with rupture would provide much-needed guidance for the treatment of unruptured intracranial aneurysms, such as surgical clipping or endovascular coiling. Morphologic factors include, but are not limited to, aneurysm size, number, shape, dome direction, neck/dome ratio, and relationship of the aneurysm to the surrounding vessels. However, the results of previous investigations concerning morphologic parameters have yielded inconsistent results.
   METHODS: This review presents and analyzes the literature on the morphology of ACoAAs and risk of rupture.
   RESULTS: This literature review reveals that the strongest predictors of ACoAA rupture are size ratio, direction of the dome, and fenestration. These were the only factors that were either unanimously or near unanimously found to be predictive of rupture across multiple studies.
   CONCLUSIONS: The size ratio, direction of the dome, and fenestration should be examined most meticulously when deciding when to treat an ACoAA.

   HYPERTENSION; DISEASE; VENOGRAPHY; MANAGEMENT; CHILDREN
AB BACKGROUND: Venous outflow obstructions are rare anatomic findings that can appear with symptoms of elevated intracranial pressure, including headache and vision loss, and can be mistaken for more common diagnoses, such as idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) or cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST). Although venous outflow obstructions have been reported in rare bone dysplasias and congenital abnormalities, to date they have not been reported in renal osteodystrophy (ROD), a relatively common disorder seen in patients with chronic kidney disease.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: In this case, the authors describe a patient with marked intracranial hypertension from jugular foramen stenosis secondary to ROD. After diagnosis by CT and magnetic resonance venography, catheter venography confirmed an osseus band around the left jugular bulb, and a 40-mm Hg pressure gradient across the stenotic foramen. The patient subsequently underwent ventriculoperitoneal shunting and optic nerve sheath fenestration with symptom improvement. The postoperative course was significant for development of CVST, necessitating treatment.
   CONCLUSIONS: This report reviews the presentation, pathology, and neurosurgical treatment of patients with ROD and venous outflow obstructions, and explores the differential diagnoses of outflow obstructions, IIH, and CVST. To our knowledge, this is the first report of intracranial hypertension from jugular foramen stenosis secondary to renal osteodystrophy.

AB BACKGROUND: The most common neurologic manifestations of fibrous dysplasia (FD) are vision and hearing loss. Optic decompression for progressive vision loss has been shown to yield positive results in terms of visual outcomes; however, emergency optic decompression surgery for sudden loss of vision in FD has not to date been reported in the pediatric population. We report the first case of FD presenting with sudden vision loss and successfully managed with emergency optic decompression.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 10-year-old male patient known to have FD with a 2-month history of progressive vision loss in his left eye presents with sudden blindness. Emergency decompression surgery restored vision in his left eye to 20/40, which remained stable on long-term follow-up.
   CONCLUSION: There is no consensus on the benefit and safety of prophylactic optic decompression, yet therapeutic decompression has been shown to prevent vision deterioration. Our findings suggest that therapeutic decompression even when done in the emergency setting yields positive results, while prophylactic decompression carries an inherent risk for loss of vision in a seeing eye.

AB BACKGROUND: Diffuse axonal injury (DAI) is a traumatic brain injury and one of the most common causes of unfavorable outcome and death. The aim of this study was to investigate the recovery of patients with pure DAI who remained in a coma for 6 hours or longer after brain injury.
   METHODS: This was a follow-up study of 75 patients diagnosed with pure DAI, aged 18-60 years, with a Glasgow Coma Scale score <= 8 at hospital admission. Patient data were collected at hospital admission, hospital discharge, and 3 and 6 months after DAI. Recovery was assessed by score changes in the Katz Index of Independence in Activities of Daily Living and Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale.
   RESULTS: The percentage of patients in a coma for 6-24 hours, >24 hours without brainstem signs, and >24 hours with brainstem signs was 42.7%, 20%, and 37.3%, respectively. The 6-month mortality rate was 32.0%, and the mean Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale score among survivors decreased from 3.8 at discharge (SD = 1.2) to 2.1 at 3 months (SD = 1.6) and 1.2 at 6 months (SD = 1.6). The mean Katz Index of Independence in Activities of Daily Living scores were 8.5 (SD = 5.5), 3.5 (SD = 5.8), and 1.8 (SD = 4.5) at discharge and 3 and 6 months after trauma, respectively. Statistically significant differences were observed among the 3 evaluation periods.
   CONCLUSIONS: Mortality was high among patients with DAI, but almost all survivors had favorable outcomes at 6 months. Functional improvement was more pronounced in the first 3 months.

AB BACKGROUND: Kummell disease is a clinical syndrome characterized by minor spinal trauma with a symptom-free period from months to years, followed by progressive painful kyphosis. Many surgical options for Kummell disease have been reported in the previous literature; however, no study has mentioned the surgical strategy for patients whose fractured vertebrae were severely compressed and only a slice of superior and inferior end plate was left.

The patient presented with constrained body posture and pressure pain on the thoracolumbar region. Visual analog scale pain under weight bearing was 90/100, and her Oswestry Disability Index score was 74%. Kummell disease was diagnosed on the basis of clinical presentation, trauma history, radiograph, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. We performed the posterior vertebral column resection through the unilateral osteotomy approach for the patient, and the clinical outcome and radiologic restoration were recorded. One year after the surgery, outpatient follow-up review revealed that the visual analog scale reduced to 10/100 and Oswestry Disability Index reduced to 13%. The posteroanterior and lateral radiograph in the standing position showed bony fusion was achieved at the osteotomy site. No pseudarthrosis or instrumentation-related failure occurred.
   CONCLUSION: Posterior vertebral column resection through unilateral osteotomy approach is an effective method for patients with Kummell disease, especially when the fractured vertebrae compressed severely and only a slice of superior and inferior end plate was left.

DE Agenesis; Epidermoid cyst; Falx cerebri; Midline anomaly; Third
   ventricle
ID CHIARI-II MALFORMATION; FISSURE
AB BACKGROUND: Complete or partial agenesis of the falx cerebri may occur in pediatric patients with developmental anomalies. However, isolated agenesis of the falx in a developmentally normal adult is exceptionally rare. We describe the first reported case of a patient with a third ventricular mass associated with partial agenesis of the anterior falx cerebri, a circumstance that influenced surgical access to a third ventricular epidermoid cyst.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 60-year-old developmentally normal woman presented with progressively worsening aphasia and altered mental status. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed obstructive hydrocephalus from a third ventricular mass. An anterior interhemispheric transcallosal approach was planned to remove the tumor. However, upon dural opening there was no evidence of a falx cerebri, an anomaly visible but not reported on the prior imaging studies. An interhemispheric fissure was present, but the medial frontal lobes were densely adherent, with multiple traversing veins within the superficial arachnoid of the fissure. Therefore, a left frontal transcortical approach was performed for microsurgical resection of the tumor. Histopathologic analysis identified the lesion to be an epidermoid cyst.
   CONCLUSIONS: Partial agenesis of the falx cerebri is exceedingly rare in a developmentally normal adult, particularly in the presence of an anatomically normal superior sagittal sinus. If present, however, it is important to note this association preoperatively because partial agenesis of the falx cerebri precludes an interhemispheric transcallosal approach to the lateral and third ventricles.

AB BACKGROUND: Spinal artery aneurysms (SAAs) are extremely rare lesions that can occur in isolation or associated with vascular malformations. Herein, we present 3 unusual cases of SAAs and discuss imaging, diagnosis, and surgical management strategies.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: The first patient was a 57-year-old woman who presented with sudden onset of severe headache. Spinal angiography demonstrated an isolated anterior spinal artery (ASA) aneurysm at the level of the craniocervical junction. The second patient was a 27-year-old woman who presented with progressive bilateral pain of her lower limbs. The result of spinal angiography was consistent with an aneurysm at the level of L1. The third patient was a 26-year-old man who presented with bilateral weakness and numbness of the lower limbs. Spinal angiography revealed a conus medullaris aneurysm associated with an arteriovenous malformation (AVM). All these lesions were successfully managed with clipping or resection, and good outcomes were achieved.
   CONCLUSION: Spinal artery aneurysms are rare lesions. Herein, we report 3 such cases and emphasize the importance of surgical management.

Here, we report on a 70-year-old woman who presented with severe subarachnoid hemorrhage from a fusiform lateral anterior (A1) artery perforator aneurysm. Unexpectedly, digital subtraction angiography was non-diagnostic. MR imaging, however, demonstrated occlusion of the aneurysm secondary to thrombosis. Surgery was performed to remove the associated hematoma, and histopathological examination verified intraaneurysmal thrombosis.

AB BACKGROUND: Preoperative embolization of highly vascular tumors of the posterior fossa can decrease morbidity and operative blood loss. No clear consensus exists for the embolization agent of choice for optimal devascularization of these tumors. The purpose of this study was to assess effectiveness of microsphere embolization in reducing tumor hypervascularity before surgical resection.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed medical records of patients with hypervascular posterior fossa tumors who were treated at a single institution from 2009 to 2016.
   RESULTS: Four of 9 patients with hypervascular posterior fossa tumors underwent embolization with 300-500 mm microspheres before surgical resection. Patients selected for embolization had large tumors with large feeding vessels evident on brain magnetic resonance imaging. Surgical resection was performed within 24 hours of embolization in all 4 patients. Mean (SD) patient age was 42.5 years (18.4), and mean (SD) tumor size was 4.3 cm (1.4) in greatest dimension. All patients presented with symptoms related to mass effect. Gross total tumor resection was achieved in all patients. There were no intraoperative complications related to the embolization or craniotomy; mean (SD) blood loss was 350 mL (208).
   CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative embolization with microspheres can effectively reduce vascularity of the hypervascular posterior fossa tumor bed. This technique helped achieve complete resection, particularly for patients with recurrence after previous resection.

AB Low back pain is the principal cause of long-term disability worldwide. We intend to address one of its main causes, degenerative disk disease, a spinal condition involving degradation of an intervertebral disk. Following unsuccessful conservative treatment, patients may be recommended for surgery. The two main surgical treatments for lumbar degenerative disk disease are lumbar fusion: traditional standard surgical treatment and lumbar disk arthroplasty, also known as lumbar total disk replacement. Lumbar fusion aims to relieve pain by fusing vertebrae together to eliminate movement at the joint, but it has been criticized for problems involving insignificant pain relief, a reduced range of motion, and an increased risk of adjacent segment degeneration. This leads to development of the lumbar total disk replacement technique, which aims to relieve pain replacing a degenerated intervertebral disk with a moveable prosthesis, thus mimicking the functional anatomy and biomechanics of a native intervertebral disk. Over the years a large range of prosthetic disks has been developed. The efficacy and current evidence for these prostheses are discussed in this review. The results of this study are intended to guide clinical practice and future lumbar total disk replacement device choice and design.

ID SUBDURAL HYGROMA; BRAIN EDEMA; WAFERS
AB BACKGROUND: Although a subdural fluid collection frequently is observed, diagnostic methods that differentiate between the subdural collection caused by external hydrocephalus and that caused by subdural hygroma have not been established. Here, we report a case of external hydrocephalus caused by Gliadel-induced eosinophilic meningitis that has been previously reported in only 1 case and can be diagnosed by time-spatial labeling inversion pulse magnetic resonance imaging (time-SLIP MRI).
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A tumor located in the left temporal was detected incidentally in an 81-year-old man by examination of a head injury. The tumor was surgically resected and diagnosed as a high-grade glioma during the surgery; Gliadel wafers subsequently were implanted. Three weeks after the resection, the patient showed disturbed consciousness, and computed tomography revealed a subdural fluid collection. The out-flow of cerebrospinal through the resection cavity was detected by time-SLIP MRI. Cerebrospinal tests indicated high white blood cell counts and high protein levels, with more than 90% of the white blood cell count comprising eosinophils. Therefore, we suspected that the subdural fluid collection was caused by external hydrocephalus because of Gliadel-induced eosinophilic meningitis. We surgically removed the Gliadel wafers and subsequently performed a surgery to insert a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. Histologic examination indicated eosinophilic accumulation around the Gliadel wafers. The patient's symptoms improved after the insertion of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt.
   CONCLUSIONS: In the present case, time-SLIP MRI was a useful and noninvasive method for diagnosing external hydrocephalus which was caused by eosinophilic meningitis because of Gliadel-induced eosinophilic meningitis.

ID DISEASE; COMPLICATIONS
AB BACKGROUND: Hypotension is a significant risk factor for the development of ischemic complication following revascularization surgery for moyamoya disease (MMD). However, it is currently unknown whether autonomic dysfunction also plays a role.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Here we report a case of MMD in which hypotension due to autonomic dysfunction caused postoperative cerebral ischemia. A 30-year-old female patient with MMD had a history of transient right hemiparesis following laughter. Single-photon emission computed tomography showed impaired cerebral blood flow (CBF) in both cerebral hemispheres, so she underwent revascularization surgery in her left cerebral hemisphere. She awoke from anesthesia uneventfully; however, 1 hour after the surgery her blood pressure suddenly dropped to 90/40 mm Hg and she became comatose. A perfusion computed tomography scan demonstrated a widespread reduction in CBF in the left hemisphere. Bezold-Jarisch reflex was thought to be the cause of the hypotension. Following treatment with a vasopressor agent, her BP increased and her consciousness rapidly recovered. The reduced CBF had almost completely recovered the next day. Head-up tilt test conducted 2 weeks after surgery demonstrated latent vasopressor-type autonomic dysfunction, which was possibly another cause of the hypotension. She was discharged from the hospital, and the laughter-induced hemiparesis gradually resolved.
   CONCLUSION: Situational neurologic deterioration in patients with MMD suggests latent autonomic dysfunction, which may be a risk factor for postoperative ischemic complications.

AB OBJECTIVE: To report a technique for endoscopic cystoventriculostomy guided by preoperative navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) and tractography in a patient with a large speech eloquent arachnoid cyst.
   METHODS: A 74-year old woman presented with a seizure and subsequent persistent anomic aphasia from a progressive left-sided parietal arachnoid cyst. An endoscopic cystoventriculostomy and endoscope-assisted ventricle catheter placement were performed. Surgery was guided by preoperative nTMS and tractography to avoid eloquent language, motor, and visual pathways.
   RESULTS: Preoperative nTMS motor and language mapping were used to guide tractography of motor and language white matter tracts. The ideal locations of entry point and cystoventriculostomy as well as trajectory for stent-placement were determined preoperatively with a pseudo-3-dimensional model visualizing eloquent language, motor, and visual cortical and subcortical information. The early postoperative course was uneventful. At her 3-month follow-up visit, her language impairments had completely recovered. Additionally, magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated complete collapse of the arachnoid cyst.
   CONCLUSION: The combination of nTMS and tractography supports the identification of a safe trajectory for cystoventriculostomy in eloquent arachnoid cysts.

TI Orbital Compartment Syndrome After Frontotemporal Craniotomy: Case
   Report and Review of Literature

AB INTRODUCTION: Orbital compartment syndrome (OCS) is a rare condition characterized by increased intraorbital pressure and hypoperfusion of critical neural structures. It is usually associated with external ophthalmoplegia. We report a case of postoperative OCS following a frontotemporal craniotomy and review pertinent literature.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 3-year-old female patient presented with a 3-year history of refractory epilepsy and diagnosis of right frontobasal cortical dysplasia. She underwent an elective frontotemporal craniotomy to allow resection of dysplastic cortex. The intraoperative period was uneventful. Post-operatively, following removal of operating fields, we noticed proptosis and right periorbital swelling. A diagnosis of orbital compartment syndrome was made. At the pediatric intensive care unit, the patient underwent an emergency right lateral canthotomy with wide inferior and superior cantholysis. Nowadays she is in the fourth month of postoperative follow-up. There is still slight and almost indistinguishable exophthalmos, but her extrinsic eye movement ranges and reaction to light are normal.
   DISCUSSION: OCS is a rare ophthalmologic emergency characterized by an acute rise in orbital pressure and may result in complete irreversible blindness if not rapidly treated. The frontotemporal or "pterional" craniotomy exposure requires a myocutaneous flap to be retracted anteriorly and inferiorly near the orbit. There may be orbital compression due to this flap leading to potential harmful complications. Attention to factors such as direct ocular pressure from skin flaps, congestion from head positioning, and adequate intraoperative eye protection may reduce the risk or allow faster management.

DT Article
DE Cavernous malformation; Pineal apoplexy; Superficial siderosis
ID APOPLEXY
AB BACKGROUND: Cavernous malformations in the pineal region are rare and difficult to anticipate from preoperative evaluation in patients with pineal apoplexy. We herein report the first case of a pineal cavernous malformation with superficial siderosis. Radiological findings were helpful in identifying the presence of the cavernous malformation.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 47-year-old female presented with a 4-month history of progressive headache, nausea, and dizziness. She complained of double vision and exhibited upward gaze palsy and papilledema on fundoscopy. Radiological examination revealed subacute hemorrhage in the pineal region and enlarged lateral ventricles. Furthermore, T2-stareweighted gradient-echo magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a linear hypointensity along the pial surface of the cerebral cortex, brainstem, and cerebellum, indicating hemosiderin deposition consistent with superficial siderosis. Suspecting the presence of a cavernous malformation based on the radiological findings of superficial siderosis, we performed total mass resection. The postoperative course was uneventful and her preoperative symptoms resolved completely.
   CONCLUSION: Radiological findings of superficial siderosis on T2-stare weighted gradient-echo imaging are useful to making a diagnosis of cavernous malformation in cases of pineal apoplexy. They are also important for making the treatment decision to perform total mass resection, which is the best curative method for pineal cavernous malformations.

AB Perioperative complications after transsphenoidal surgery for pituitary adenomas have been well documented in the literature; however, some complications can occur in a delayed fashion postoperatively, and reports are sparse about their occurrence, management, and outcome. Here, we describe delayed complications after transsphenoidal surgery and discuss the incidence, temporality from the surgery, and management of these complications based on the findings of studies that reported delayed postoperative epistaxis, delayed postoperative cavernous carotid pseudoaneurysm formation and rupture, vasospasm, delayed symptomatic hyponatremia, hypopituitarism, hydrocephalus, and sinonasal complications. Our findings from this review revealed an incidence of 0.6%-3.3% for delayed postoperative epistaxis at 1-3 weeks postoperatively, 18 reported cases of delayed carotid artery pseudoaneurysm formation at 2 days to 10 years postoperatively, 30 reported cases of postoperative vasospasm occurring 8 days postoperatively, a 3.6%-19.8% rate of delayed symptomatic hyponatremia at 4-7 days postoperatively, a 3.1% rate of new-onset hypopituitarism at 2 months postoperatively, and a 0.4%-5.8% rate of hydrocephalus within 2.2 months postoperatively. Sinonasal complications are commonly reported after transsphenoidal surgery, but spontaneous resolutions within 3-12 months have been reported. Although the incidence of some of these complications is low, providing preoperative counseling to patients with pituitary tumors regarding these delayed complications and proper postoperative follow-up planning is an important part of treatment planning.

AB Recognition of transdural spinal cord herniation has increased over the past decade. This condition remains little known, particularly outside the specialized fields of spinal surgery and neuroradiology, leading to a significant delay in clinical diagnosis and treatment. It should be considered among the differential diagnoses in patients with gradual-onset lower-limb weakness of presumed spinal origin. Reaching a diagnosis using magnetic resonance imaging is essential to refer patients for surgery before their myelopathy worsens. We describe our surgical experience to untether the spinal cord by wrapping a dura graft around the spinal cord. Three case reports and a review of the literature are discussed.

ID VIABLE INTRAUTERINE PREGNANCY; METASTATIC CHORIOCARCINOMA; COEXISTENT
AB BACKGROUND: Choriocarcinoma coexisting with or after normal pregnancy is extremely rare. To our knowledge, our case report is the first time cerebral mycotic pseudoaneurysms from choriocarcinoma have been proven angiographically.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 38-week pregnant 26-year-old woman presented with an acute left frontal hemorrhage. She underwent emergency cesarean section, followed by hematoma evacuation and resection of what grossly appeared to be a medium-sized arteriovenous malformation at the time of surgery. Angiogram before and after resection showed no obvious vascular pathology. One month later, she returned with status epilepticus, and an acute parenchymal hematoma posterior to the surgical resection cavity was identified. Angiography showed a multilobulated pseudoaneurysm along the left middle cerebral artery. This was resected and found on histopathology to have choriocarcinoma within and around the blood vessels. Serum human chorionic gonadotrophin levels increased daily. Pan computed tomography showed a left lung lobular mass. The diagnosis was stage 4 World Health Organization score 9 high-risk metastatic choriocarcinoma requiring radiation followed by multiagent chemotherapy. Two weeks later, she had another seizure. An angiogram showed an unruptured pseudoaneurysm along the right posterior cerebral artery, which was embolized.
   CONCLUSIONS: Metastatic choriocarcinoma is rarely considered during a viable pregnancy but is almost always fatal if unrecognized. Early recognition enhances the chances of cure with chemotherapy. Arteriovenous malformations are typically considered in young women with intracerebral hemorrhages and have higher risk of rupture in pregnant women, but physicians should also be aware of metastatic choriocarcinoma and the development of mycotic aneurysms in peripartum women with intracerebral hemorrhages.

AB BACKGROUND: Blood blister-like aneurysms (BBAs) are rare but dangerous and challenging to treat. Recurrence and rebleeding are often reported, and many neurosurgeons and interventional radiologists are discouraged by such poor outcomes. Currently, there is no standard method to treat this type of aneurysm.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We describe 5 cases of ruptured BBAs in the supraclinoid segment of the internal carotid artery, which were treated successfully using a suturing technique. No patient experienced recurrence or rebleeding, and all patients had a good prognosis.
   CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that this suturing technique is an optional safe and reliable method to treat BBAs.

DE Cervical; Cervicothoracic; Herniation; Intradural disc
ID SPINAL MANIPULATION; PATIENT; RUPTURE; LESIONS
AB OBJECTIVE: Spontaneous cervical intradural disc herniation (IDH) is a rare occurrence with limited and disparate information available regarding its presentation, diagnosis, and treatment. However, its accurate detection is vital for planning surgical treatment. In this review of the literature, we collected data from all cervical IDHs described to date. Particular attention was paid to diagnostic findings, surgical approach, and causation for cervical IDH, especially at the cervicothoracic junction.
   METHODS: A review for cases of cervical IDH was performed via the following search criteria: ("neck"[MeSH Terms] OR "neck"[All Fields] OR "cervical"[All Fields]) AND intradural[All Fields] AND disc[All Fields]. Thirty-seven cases of cervical disc herniation were identified. Demographic variables identified included age, sex, cervical level of herniation, history of associated cervical trauma, presence of Brown-Sequard syndrome, Horner syndrome, and other neurologic findings, radiographic findings, direction of surgical approach, and postoperative outcomes.
   RESULTS: A total of 37 cases of cervical IDH were identified. Most of the cases occurred at the lower levels of the cervical spine, with 35.1% at the C5-C6 level, followed by 24.3% at C6-C7, and lower still at other levels. Of the patients reviewed, 44.4% had a previous history of trauma before manifestation of symptom, with the majority being spontaneous IDH with no previous history of trauma or spine surgery. Brown-Sequard syndrome was present in 43.2% of the patients, whereas 10.8% of patients experienced Horner syndrome. The most common presentations of IDH included quadriplegia, finger/gait ataxia, radiculopathy, and nuchal pain. The degree of neurologic recovery was not associated with patient age. Most of the cervical IDHs in the literature were treated surgically via an anterior approach, but a larger portion of patients who underwent a posterior approach had improved recovery.
   CONCLUSIONS: Cervical IDH is a rare event, with this review of the literature outlining the clinical and radiographic parameters of its presentation as well as comparing common surgical strategies for treatment. We outline theories underlying the development of cervical IDH and argue for a posterior surgical approach in which the disc herniation is sequestrated with migration.

AB BACKGROUND: Gait abnormalities have been seen in patients with Parkinson disease or Parkinson-like (P-L) disorders and cervical spinal stenosis. Acute presentation of P-L symptoms has been reported in 24 cases caused by chronic subdural hematomas with 11 cases due to bilateral chronic subdural hematomas. When a patient also presents with cervical spinal stenosis, the correct therapeutic decision between P-L disorders and myelopathy is challenging.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: An 80-year-old male presented with a 2-week history of weakness in his left leg. A few days before presentation, his gait had deteriorated quite dramatically. Neurologic examination showed mild leg weakness, hyperreflexia, and a gait that was slow and wide based, at times festinating but with relatively spared arm movement. He also had masked facial features with increased tone in his extremities. Magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical spine showed cervical stenosis at C5-6, and computed tomography of the head showed large bilateral subdural hematomas. The subdural hematomas were drained. Immediate improvement in his symptoms was observed with complete resolution by his third month of follow-up. The patient never had a history of Parkinson disease.
   CONCLUSIONS: This paper reports for the first time a patient who presented with acute P-L symptoms and cervical myelopathy with findings of both bilateral chronic subdural hematomas and cervical spinal stenosis. The decision to drain the subdural hematoma in our case resulted in full recovery of the patient's gait and other extrapyramidal symptoms. This paper reviews the literature on reversible P-L symptoms caused by bilateral chronic subdural hematomas.

AB BACKGROUND: Lymphoplasmacyte-rich meningioma is an uncommon variant of meningioma, and that arising in the extradural site is extremely rare.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a case of primary intraosseous lymphoplasmacyte-rich meningioma. A 51-year-old woman presented with left frontal scalp swelling lasting longer than 1 year. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an intraosseous extradural mass in the left frontal region with bone destruction. Surgical resection of the mass with a cranioplasty was performed. The postoperative course was uneventful, and histopathologic findings were consistent with a lymphoplasmacyte-rich meningioma. After a follow-up period of 2 years, no residual tumor or in situ recurrence was noted.
   CONCLUSIONS: Lymphoplasmacyte-rich meningioma occurring in the intraosseous extradural region is extremely rare. It is crucial for clinicians to be aware of this entity as it can be easily mistaken for more common osteogenic neoplasms occurring at this site.

IgG4-related disease is a relatively new clinical entity and is not commonly encountered by neurosurgeons. MD sometimes mimics intraorbital tumors such as malignant lymphoma but responds well to corticosteroid treatment. Thus it is important to recognize the clinical and radiographic features of MD.

AB BACKGROUND: Spinal extradural arachnoid cysts are relatively uncommon. Rarely, large cysts presented with spinal cord compression requiring surgical intervention.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a patient with a progressively enlarging spinal extradural arachnoid cyst causing worsening right S1 radiculopathy and gastrocnemius muscle atrophy. Electromyography and nerve conduction studies revealed an S1 motor radiculopathy. Serial magnetic resonance imaging findings confirmed enlargement of the small cyst originating from the sacral thecal sac on the right while 2 smaller cysts on the left remained stable. Dynamic computed tomography myelogram revealed connection to the thecal sac behind the right S1 nerve root. We performed a right hemilaminectomy from L5 to S2, exposed the cyst pedicle ligated it, and marsupialized the cy st. After surgery, the patient showed clinical and electrodiagnostic improvement.
   CONCLUSION: This case illustrates the principles of timely surgical intervention after advanced diagnostic imaging and electrodiagnostic testing to improve neurologic function and minimize complications.

SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY

DT Editorial Material
DE Flow voids; Giant adenoma; Hyperperfusion; Pituicytoma
ID PITUITARY-GLAND
AB Pituicytomas are rare low-grade glial lesions of neurohypophysis or adenohypophysis. They are often misdiagnosed as adenomas due to their similar morphology. Previous reports have underlined their nonspecific aspect. In our experience, presence of flow voids on magnetic resonance, which usually indicate hypervascularized tumors with strong arterial supply, may be a useful sign to identify pituicytomas. Unlike adenomas, pituicytomas are highly vascularized tumors. Second, we emphasize the strong enhancement of these tumors when compared with normal hypophysis, which may be another sign of their hypervascularization. Indeed, adenomas, on the opposite side, present less enhancement than normal hypophysis. This observation is corroborated by previous histologic studies that showed adenomas present less vascular density than normal pituitary glands. However, in large tumors, the normal hypophysis can sometimes not be individualized and thus the enhancement gradient between the tumor and normal tissue cannot be properly assessed. Due to their rarity, no previous reports had ever emphasized the specific signs that could allow us to differentiate pituicytomas from adenomas; however, it seems crucial due to the potential hemorrhagic complications of pituicytoma surgery.

AB BACKGROUND: Exact identification of feeding arteries, shunt points, and draining veins is essential in treating cavernous sinus dural arteriovenous fistula (CS dAVF). In addition to digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and 3-dimensional rotational angiography (3DRA), high-resolution cone beam computed tomography (CBCT; especially 80-kv high-resolution cone beam computed tomography) have been performed in recent years. We evaluated the efficacy of CBCT in treating CS dAVF.
   METHODS: Eight CS dAVFs were treated with endovascular embolization between January 2013 and December 2016. We retrospectively examined these cases regarding information from DSA, 3DRA, and CBCT with contrast medium.
   RESULTS: Although all procedures can evaluate feeding arteries, shunt points, and draining veins, CBCT can provide the best definition of feeders and their course through the bony structures and the compartment of CS. Therefore, CBCT with placed microcatheter in the CS can reveal whether the microcatheter is set at the appropriate compartment to be embolized.
   CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of CBCT in treating dAVF is illustrating the relationships among the bony structures and feeders, compartment of CS, and the position of the microcatheter. Detailed information obtained with CBCT can lead to fewer complications and more effective treatment.

AB BACKGROUND: Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome (KTWS) is a rare congenital vascular disorder characterized by the classic triad of cutaneous nevi, venous varicosities, and osseous and soft tissue hypertrophy of the affected limb. Various vascular anomalies of the central nervous system have also been described in patients with KTWS. The English language literature to date contains 6 reports of associations between KTWS and spinal cord cavernous angioma (CA), but management of these patients has not been well described.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 23-year-old woman was admitted to our institution with acute onset of leg weakness accompanied by upper back pain. Thoracic magnetic resonance imaging of the spinal cord showed a heterogeneous mass with a slit component at the T1-2 level. The patient underwent left hemilaminectomy followed by removal of the tumor, and her neurologic symptoms improved postoperatively. Pathologic examination showed the spinal lesion was characterized by hemosiderin deposition and thin-walled vascular channels surrounded by fibrous tissue.
   CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report to provide a detailed pathologic description of the features of spinal CA in a patient with KTWS. Assessment of the clinical features and management of CA associated with KTWS are discussed. This syndrome is rare, and further experience in the treatment of these patients is needed. However, considering that the pathologic findings of spinal CA in patients with KTWS include the typical features of CA, the management of CA in patients with KTWS may be identical to management of isolated CA.

AB BACKGROUND: Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RSTS) is a rare, congenital syndrome that is known to be associated with neoplasms of various organ systems. Evaluation and treatment of such patients is challenging, given the cognitive delay and heterogeneity of pathologic presentations that define this syndrome.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Presented here is a case of a patient with RSTS, diagnosed at birth, who presented with subtle symptoms of lethargy and a change in behavior. He was found to have a large (7.0-cm x 4.7-cm), right-sided brain mass that was eventually diagnosed as a primary central nervous system lymphoma.
   CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a primary central nervous system lymphoma presenting in a patient with RSTS. This was confirmed through microscopic and histologic studies. The large size attained by this mass in our patient highlights the increased scrutiny and surveillance needed to provide the best care for these patients. A multidisciplinary team approach is ideal as successful treatment of our patient using surgical debulking, appropriate chemotherapy, and close postoperative follow-up has resulted in an excellent clinical outcome.

AB Vertigo is one of the most common presentations in adult patients. Among the various causes of vertigo, so-called cervical vertigo is still a controversial entity. Cervical vertigo was first thought to be due to abnormal input from cervical sympathetic nerves based on the work of Barre and Lieou in 1928. Later studies found that cerebral blood flow is not influenced by sympathetic stimulation. Ryan and Cope in 1955 proposed that abnormal sensory information from the damaged joint receptors of upper cervical regions may be related to pathologies of vertigo of cervical origin. Further studies found that cervical vertigo seems to originate from diseased cervical intervertebral discs. Recent research found that the ingrowth of a large number of Ruffini corpuscles into diseased cervical discs may be related to vertigo of cervical origin. Abnormal neck proprioceptive input integrated from the signals of Ruffini corpuscles in diseased cervical discs and muscle spindles in tense neck muscles secondary to neck pain is transmitted to the central nervous system and leads to a sensory mismatch with vestibular and other sensory information, resulting in a subjective feeling of vertigo and unsteadiness. Further studies are needed to illustrate the complex pathophysiologic mechanisms of cervical vertigo and to better understand and manage this perplexing entity.

AB BACKGROUND: Injury to distal portion of posterior cord of brachial plexus leads to palsy of radial and axillary nerves. Symptoms are usually motor deficits of the deltoid muscle; triceps brachii muscle; and extensor muscles of the wrist, thumb, and fingers. Tendon transfers, nerve grafts, and nerve transfers are options for surgical treatment of proximal radial nerve palsy to restore some motor functions. Tendon transfer is painful, requires a long immobilization, and decreases donor muscle strength; nevertheless, nerve transfer produces promising outcomes. We present a patient with proximal radial nerve palsy following a blunt injury undergoing triple nerve transfer.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: The patient was involved in a motorcycle accident with complete palsy of the radial and axillary nerves. After 6 months, on admission, he showed spontaneous recovery of axillary nerve palsy, but radial nerve palsy remained. We performed triple nerve transfer, fascicle of ulnar nerve to long head of the triceps branch of radial nerve, flexor digitorum superficialis branch of median nerve to extensor carpi radialis brevis branch of radial nerve, and flexor carpi radialis branch of median nerve to posterior interosseous nerve, for restoration of elbow, wrist, and finger extensions, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our experience confirmed functional elbow, wrist, and finger extensions in the patient. Triple nerve transfer restores functions of the upper limb in patients with debilitating radial nerve palsy after blunt injuries.

ID CANCER
AB BACKGROUND: Germline pathogenic variants in BRCA1-associated protein-1 (BAP1), a nuclear ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase with evidence suggestive of independent tumor suppressor function, predispose affected families to uveal melanoma, cutaneous melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, malignant mesothelioma, and possibly a range of other tumors and malignancies as part of the BAP1 tumor predisposition syndrome, a recently recognized hereditary cancer syndrome.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 50-year-old woman presented with a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor of the left fifth metatarsal head. Further examination revealed a right renal mass and left breast mass. Her family history was significant for astrocytoma, melanoma, cholangiocarcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, prostate cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Genetic testing revealed a BAP1 mutation in the proband.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although there have been reports of sarcomas and meningiomas in patients affected with BAP1 mutations, to our knowledge malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors in this patient population have not been previously reported. We report a case of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor in a patient affected by a BAP1 mutation.

AB BACKGROUND: Since the 1950s cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt dependency has no longer been a contradiction to normal life, including sexuality and pregnancy in women, because of advances in the understanding of hydrocephalus and shunt technology. Although pregnancy in shunt-dependent women is rare, it causes uncertainty among treating physicians.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report the case of a 34-year-old pregnant woman with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. Throughout her pregnancy she experienced progressive symptoms of CSF underdrainage without any signs of other pregnancy-related complications. After the delivery of a healthy infant, shunt resistance had to be readjusted to prepregnancy levels. A comprehensive review of the literature reports in English, listed in PubMed, is provided.
   CONCLUSIONS: Conservative treatment of pregnancy-related functional underdrainage by consecutive valve pressure adjustment is possible, easy, and safe.

AB The field of neurosurgery has a rich and fascinating history. The development of the specialty in Hawaii has been particularly unique, given the state's remote location, indigenous population, and military presence. The life of Dr. Ralph B. Cloward, Hawaii's most noted neurosurgeon, has received some attention in the literature. However, a comprehensive review of this history, including the pre-Cloward and post-Cloward era, is lacking. This article will review and chronicle the development of neurosurgery in Hawaii with special attention to 3 topics: the traveling neurosurgeons of the early 20th century, such as Dr. Frederick Reichert; Hawaii's first full time neurosurgeon, Dr. Cloward; and finally, the current state of neurosurgery in Hawaii.

AB BACKGROUND: Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is managed across the full spectrum of healthcare, from clinical diagnosis to management of the hemorrhage and associated complications. Knowledge of the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of SAH is widely known; however, a full understanding of the underlying molecular, cellular, and circulatory dynamics has still to be achieved. Intracranial complications including delayed ischemic neurologic deficit (vasospasm), rebleed, and hydrocephalus form the targets for initial management. However, the extracranial consequences including hypertension, hyponatremia, and cardiopulmonary abnormalities can frequently arise during the management phase and have shown to directly affect clinical outcome. This review will provide an update on the pathophysiology of SAH, including the intra-and extracranial consequences, with a particular focus on the extracranial consequences of SAH.
   METHODS: We review the literature and provide a comprehensive update on the extracranial consequences of SAH that we hope will help the management of these cohort of patients.
   RESULTS: In addition to the pathophysiology of SAH, the following complications were examined and discussed: vasospasm, seizures, rebleed, hydrocephalus, fever, anemia, hypertension, hypotension, hyperglycemia, hyponatremia, hypernatremia, cardiac abnormalities, pulmonary edema, venous thromboembolism, gastric ulceration, nosocomial infection, bloodstream infection/sepsis, and iatrogenic complications.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although the intracranial complications of SAH can take priority in the initial management, the extracranial complications should be monitored for and recognized as early as possible because these complications can develop at varying times throughout the course of the condition. Therefore, a variety of investigations, as described by this article, should be undertaken on admission to maximize early recognition of any of the extracranial consequences. Furthermore, because the extracranial complications have a direct effect on clinical outcome and can lead to and exacerbate the intracranial complications, monitoring, recognizing, and managing these complications in parallel with the intracranial complications is important and would allow optimization of the patient's management and thus help improve their overall outcome.

ID INTRAVENTRICULAR HEMORRHAGE; RUPTURE
AB BACKGROUND: Collateral artery aneurysms are a source of intracranial hemorrhage in moyamoya disease. Several reports have shown that surgical revascularization leads to the obliteration of collateral artery aneurysms. However, its effect on the prevention of rebleeding has not been established, and the optimal timing of the operation remains unclear. The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the effects of surgical revascularization and to investigate the optimal operation timing in patients with moyamoya disease who have ruptured collateral artery aneurysms on the ventricular wall.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Two patients with moyamoya disease who presented with intraventricular hemorrhage caused by rupture of collateral artery aneurysms on the wall of the lateral ventricle are presented here. In both cases, the aneurysms reruptured approximately 1 month after the initial hemorrhage. Both patients successfully underwent superficial temporal arteryemiddle cerebral artery anastomosis combined with indirect bypass in the subacute stage. The aneurysms decreased with the development of collateral circulation through the direct bypasses, and rebleeding did not occur after the surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: Because ruptured collateral artery aneurysms on the wall of the lateral ventricle in moyamoya disease are prone to rerupture within 1 month, surgical revascularization may be recommended as soon as the patients are stable and able to withstand the operation.

AB BACKGROUND: Atlanto-occipital dislocation (AOD) is a lesion rarely observed in a trauma center, because of high mortality in the preclinical phase. The number of AOD survivors is increasing thanks to the improvement in pre-hospital resuscitation.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Our goal is to describe a case of incomplete atlantooccipital dislocation presented without any neurologic, cardiorespiratory, or metabolic problems, which remained constant even after surgical treatment. Our purpose is also to discuss treatment approaches to minimize subsequent neurologic deficits.
   CONCLUSIONS: We recommend a rapid immobilization with spine table and cervical collar, the consensual stabilization of hemodynamic and respiratory parameters, and a successive prompt occipitocervical stabilization. C2 should be included in the stabilization because of the ligamentous conformation of craniocervical joint.

DE Carotid artery stenting; Cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome;
   Pseudo-occlusion; Staged angioplasty
ID STENOSIS
AB BACKGROUND: Staged angioplasty for carotid artery stenosis has been reported to be effective in preventing postoperative cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome (CHS) in patients with severe carotid stenosis; thus, it is also recommended for patients with internal carotid artery (ICA) pseudo-occlusion, the treatment strategy for which is controversial.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: This study reports the case of an Asian man in his 50s who had motor aphasia and right-side weakness caused by pseudo-occlusion of the left ICA. After medical treatment, he underwent a staged angioplasty. After the first stage of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, anterograde blood flow to the left ICA increased but the distal ICA remained partially collapsed. Initially, the second stage of carotid artery stenting (CAS) was planned for 2 weeks after the first stage; however, hemorrhagic infarction was observed the day before the CAS, and it was postponed by 2 weeks, after adjustment of antiplatelet therapy. At the time of the CAS, the diameter of the initially collapsed left distal ICA was remodeled and it was fully dilated; thus, we used a balloon-type embolic protection device and conducted CAS successfully without apparent embolic complications. The postoperative course was uneventful. The patient did not develop CHS.
   CONCLUSIONS: Besides preventing CHS, staged angioplasty has advantages when used for treating patients with ICA pseudo-occlusions in that the extent of dilation of the distal ICA after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty can be confirmed and the development of a possible hemorrhagic infarction can be assessed before stent placement.

DE Anterior choroidal artery variant; Posterior communicating artery
ID MICROSURGICAL ANATOMY; ANOMALOUS ORIGIN
AB BACKGROUND: The origin point of the anterior choroidal artery (AChA) is variable, typically arising from the supraclinoid internal carotid artery (ICA) distal to the posterior communicating artery (PComA) on either the posterolateral or posterior aspect of the ICA. Variations of AChA origin have important clinical implications, and rare origins reported previously include the ICA bifurcation and middle cerebral artery. We provide illustrations of a case of a shared-origin PComA and AChA.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A young girl presented with intracranial hemorrhage and underwent angiography to evaluate for an underlying cause. Ultimately, 3-dimensional rotational angiography incidentally demonstrated a common origin of the AChA with the PComA.
   CONCLUSIONS: A rare case of a shared-origin AChA and PComA is reported for angiographic illustration. The radiologic findings, embryology behind the development of the AChA, and neurosurgical and neurovascular relevance of this variant are discussed. The importance of recognizing the origin of the AChA is emphasized.

   ANEURYSMS; PERICALLOSAL ARTERY; CLINICAL-FEATURES
AB BACKGROUND: Pediatric intracranial aneurysms (IAs) are rare. Compared with adult IAs, they are more commonly giant, fusiform, or dissecting. Treatment often proves more complex, and recurrence rate and de novo aneurysmogenesis incidence are higher. A consensus regarding the most appropriate algorithm for following pediatric IAs is lacking.
   METHODS: We sought to generate recommendations based on the reported experience in the literature with pediatric IAs through a thorough review of the PubMed database, discussion with experienced neurointerventionalists, and our own experience.
   RESULTS: Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) was utilized immediately post-operatively for microsurgically-clipped and endovascularly-treated IAs, at 6-12 months postoperatively for endovascularly-treated IAs, and in cases of aneurysmal recurrence or de novo aneurysmogenesis discovered by non-invasive imaging modalities. Computed tomographic angiography was the preferred imaging modality for long-term follow-up of microsurgically clipped IAs. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) was the preferred modality for following IAs that were untreated, endovascularly-treated, or microsurgically-treated in a manner other than clipping.
   CONCLUSIONS: We propose incidental untreated IAs to be followed by magnetic resonance angiography without contrast enhancement. Follow-up modality and interval for treated pediatric IAs is determined by initial aneurysmal complexity, treatment modality, and degree of posttreatment obliteration. Recurrence or de novo aneurysmogenesis requiring treatment should be followed by digital subtraction angiography and appropriate retreatment. Computed tomography angiography is preferred for clipped IAs, whereas contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography is preferred for lesions treated endovascularly with coil embolization and lesions treated microsurgically in a manner other than clipping.

AB BACKGROUND: Chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) is a common intracranial hematoma. The number of patients who undergo anticoagulant therapy including a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) is expected to increase. Recently, idarucizumab, the antidote for dabigatran, which is a DOAC, has been developed. We successfully treated CSDH with dabigatran using emergency burr hole surgery and idarucizumab.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 79-year-old Japanese man severely hit his head and visited the emergency department. Computed tomography (CT) showed tiny traumatic acute subdural hematoma, for which he was admitted. At that time, atrial fibrillation was newly detected, for which dabigatran, having a specific antidote (idarucizumab), was chosen and started 2 weeks after the discharge. Two months after the trauma episode, he revisited the emergency department because of acute left upper and lower limb motor weakness. CT revealed a midline shifted CSDH. Considering rush course of motor weakness and shifted brain, we performed emergency surgery using an antidote for dabigatran, idarucizumab. He was discharged 5 days after surgery without any complications or excessive perioperative hemorrhage.
   CONCLUSION: Dabigatran should be used for atrial fibrillation detected after head trauma. Emergency surgery can be safely performed for CSDH with dabigatran using idarucizumab.

   DISEASE
AB BACKGROUND: Spinal hemangioblastomas account for 1%-5% of all spinal cord tumors. Although spinal hemangioblastomas are rare, it is exceedingly rare to have a case of intradural extramedullary hemangioblastoma of the spine, especially in isolation without von Hippel-Lindau syndrome. The purpose of this report is to present a rare case of intradural extramedullary hemangioblastoma of the cauda equina and a literature review.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: An 82-year-old man presented with an intradural mass at the L4 spinal level on magnetic resonance imaging. Given the benign appearance on magnetic resonance imaging and lack of radiculopathy, the decision was made to observe the patient. Over the course of 4 years, the tumor enlarged and caused left lower extremity radicular pain. Posterior laminectomy and tumor excision was performed. Owing to intimate involvement with multiple nerve roots, subtotal resection was performed. Immunohistopathologic analysis revealed a highly vascular and cellular tumor, with findings consistent with intradural extramedullary hemangioblastoma. The patient ultimately underwent CyberKnife radiosurgery for residual tumor, with improvement in neurologic symptoms. Follow-up studies at 2 years failed to show any tumor growth.
   CONCLUSIONS: Literature review revealed cauda equina intradural extramedullary spinal hemangioblastoma to be a rare diagnosis. Furthermore, this was a sporadic case without associated von Hippel-Lindau syndrome. Only 20 previous cases have been reported. Immunohistopathologic analysis was required to make the diagnosis. Radiosurgery appears to be useful in cases of residual tumor after subtotal tumor resection.

ID SUPERIOR SAGITTAL SINUS; INTRACRANIAL MENINGIOMAS; RECURRENCE; RESECTION
AB BACKGROUND: Torcular meningiomas involving major dural venous sinuses are rare entities and a great challenge for neurosurgeons. The deep knowledge of the patency of occlusion of the sinuses, the extent of the occlusion and potentially new developing of extra and intracranial collateral venous drainage as compensatory venous channels, are at the base of a correct operative strategy.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 45-year-old woman presented with persistent headache. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and digital subtraction angiography demonstrated a huge torcular meningioma with complete multi-venous sinus occlusion and a wide venous network for brain and tumor drainage. In these rare cases, we have hypothesized the presence of venous drainage shared by the brain and the tumor, which could generate undesirable venous occlusion during operative resection. This could be a cause of the well-known surgical complications, such as brain swelling and hemorrhagic infarction.
   CONCLUSIONS: We report our experience with a huge torcular meningioma with multi-venous sinus invasion and a literature review, with a special emphasis on compensatory drainage veins and surgical strategy.

AB BACKGROUND: The current surgical treatment of choice for refractory intracranial hypertension after traumatic brain injury (TBI) is decompressive craniectomy. Despite efficacy in control of intracranial pressure (ICP), its contribution to an improved outcome is debatable.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We describe a case of refractory intracranial hypertension successfully managed with cisternostomy. The rationale for this surgical technique is discussed, with a focus on the pathophysiologic processes underlying elevated ICP and its improvement after surgery.
   CONCLUSION: Cisternostomy proved to have an immediate effect in controlling ICP and improving brain oxygenation and metabolism.

DE Pituitary abscess; Pituitary surgery; Transsphenoidal surgery
ID DIAGNOSIS; MANAGEMENT; EXPERIENCE; OUTCOMES; SURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: Noniatrogenic pituitary abscess remains a rare clinical entity, and is the indication for surgery in <1% of transsphenoidal approaches. Correct diagnosis of this rare entity is often delayed. Without timely treatment, morbidity and mortality are high. Of the 200 cases reported to date, less than one-half have identified a causative organism. We report the second case of a pituitary abscess caused by Candida species, and also provide an intraoperative video showing the endoscopic management of this pathology.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 33-year-old woman presented with headache, hypopituitarism, and vision loss in the setting of diabetic ketoacidosis, and was found to have multiple abscesses in the liver, lung, kidney, and uterus. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed a 15-mm cystic sellar mass with restricted diffusion. The patient underwent urgent evacuation of the abscess via an endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal route, with obvious purulent material filling the sella, later identified as Candida glabrata. Antimicrobial therapy was refined appropriately, and she exhibited significant improvement in neurologic function, although endocrinopathy has persisted.
   CONCLUSIONS: With timely management, including a combination of surgical drainage and appropriate antimicrobial therapy, neurologic outcomes are good in most cases of pituitary abscess; however, endocrinopathy often does not improve. Although most reported cases with identified causative organisms speciate bacteria, some cases are of fungal etiology and require different antimicrobial agents. This further underscores the importance of identifying the causative agent.

   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present the case of a 42-year-old woman who developed a direct cavernous carotid fistula after a motor vehicle accident. Angiographic imaging revealed a rupture point of a persistent trigeminal artery as it connected with the cavernous segment of the internal carotid artery, causing a cavernous sinus fistula. Coiling of the cavernous sinus was abandoned after placement of 1 coil because of coil herniation into the internal carotid artery. A Pipeline embolization device was placed to oppose the coil against the intima and keep the lumen open. The combination of coil embolization and flow diversion acutely decreased the fistulous flow. Surprisingly, an angiographic follow-up at 6 months showed complete fistula occlusion despite placement of only 1 coil into the cavernous sinus.
   CONCLUSIONS: We report a rare case where undercoiling of the cavernous sinus occluded a cavernous sinus fistula because of the adjunct use of a Pipeline embolization device in the presence of a traumatic rupture of a persistent trigeminal artery.

AB OBJECTIVE: Accurate measurement of surgical outcomes is highly desirable to optimize surgical decision-making. An important element of surgical decision making is identification of the patient cohort that will benefit from surgery before the intervention. Machine learning (ML) enables computers to learn from previous data to make accurate predictions on new data. In this systematic review, we evaluate the potential of ML for neurosurgical outcome prediction.
   METHODS: A systematic search in the PubMed and Embase databases was performed to identify all potential relevant studies up to January 1, 2017.
   RESULTS: Thirty studies were identified that evaluated ML algorithms used as prediction models for survival, recurrence, symptom improvement, and adverse events in patients undergoing surgery for epilepsy, brain tumor, spinal lesions, neurovascular disease, movement disorders, traumatic brain injury, and hydrocephalus. Depending on the specific prediction task evaluated and the type of input features included, ML models predicted outcomes after neurosurgery with a median accuracy and area under the receiver operating curve of 94.5% and 0.83, respectively. Compared with logistic regression, ML models performed significantly better and showed a median absolute improvement in accuracy and area under the receiver operating curve of 15% and 0.06, respectively. Some studies also demonstrated a better performance in ML models compared with established prognostic indices and clinical experts.
   CONCLUSIONS: In the research setting, ML has been studied extensively, demonstrating an excellent performance in outcome prediction for a wide range of neurosurgical conditions. However, future studies should investigate how ML can be implemented as a practical tool supporting neurosurgical care.

AB OBJECTIVE: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to examine the effect of growth hormone-replacement therapy (GHRT) on the recurrence of craniopharyngioma in children.
   METHODS: PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched through April 2017 for studies that evaluated the effect of GHRT on the recurrence of pediatric craniopharyngioma. Pooled effect estimates were calculated with fixed-and random-effects models.
   RESULTS: Ten studies (n = 3487 patients) met all inclusion criteria, including 2 retrospective cohorts and 8 case series. Overall, 3436 pediatric patients were treated with GHRT after surgery and 51 were not. Using the fixed effect model, we found that the overall craniopharyngioma recurrence rate was lower among children who were treated by GHRT (10.9%; 95% confidence interval 9.80%-12.1%; I-2 = 89.1%; P for heterogeneity < 0.01; n = 10 groups) compared with those who were not (35.2%; 95% confidence interval 23.1%-49.6%; I-2 = 61.7%; P for heterogeneity = 0.11; n = 3); the P value comparing the 2 groups was < 0.01. Among patients who were treated with GHRT, subgroup analysis revealed that there was a greater prevalence of craniopharyngioma recurrence among studies conducted outside the United States (P < 0.01), single-center studies (P < 0.01), lower impact factor studies (P = 0.03), or studies with a lower quality rating (P [0.01). Using the random-effects model, we found that the results were not materially different except for when stratifying by GHRT, impact factor, or study quality; this led to nonsignificant differences. Both Begg's rank correlation test (P = 0.7) and Egger's linear regression test (P = 0.06) indicated no publication bias.
   CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis demonstrated a lower recurrence rate of craniopharyngioma among children treated with GHRT than those who were not.

AB BACKGROUND: Chordoma that occurs primarily in the sella turcica is rare and presents unique treatment challenges.
   OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine common features, treatment approaches, and survival characteristics of intrasellar chordoma.
   METHODS: Institutional databases, the SEER (Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results) database, and PubMed/EMBASE were queried for chordoma with a primarily intrasellar component. The SEER database was also queried for adult skull base chordoma. Patient-level data were extracted where available. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were conducted.
   RESULTS: Among 80 cases, the mean age at presentation was 55.6 (standard deviation, 15.9), with a female predominance (1.16: 1.00). Patients experienced symptoms for a mean duration of 19.0 months, including cranial nerve deficits, hypopituitarism, and hyperprolactinemia. Among patients receiving treatment, 77.5% underwent surgery. In addition, less than half of the patients (n = 34, 47.3%) received adjuvant radiation therapy. The 5-year overall survival (OS) of intrasellar chordoma was 60.0% (standard error [SE], 6.9). Patients aged 40 years and younger had a 5-year OS of 80.8% (SE, 12.2), compared with patients older than 40 years, who had an OS of 55.4% (SE, 7.7) (Mantel-Cox, P = 0.044). Males experienced a lower 5-year OS (44.0; SE, 9.7) than did females (76.8; SE, 8.5), (Mantel-Cox, P = 0.003). Median OS was greater in patients with skull base chordoma than in patients with intrasellar chordoma (Mantel-Cox, P = 0.046).
   CONCLUSIONS: Intrasellar chordoma presents frequently with visual disturbances and hyperprolactinemia and has a slightly higher incidence in females. Young age predicts a better prognosis. Intrasellar chordoma has a lower overall survival than has skull base chordoma.

AB BACKGROUND: Telemetric intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring seems to be a promising therapy-supporting option in shunt-treated patients. Benefits become obvious when headaches are unspecific and clinical symptoms cannot be related to possible overdrainage or under-drainage. In this study, we evaluated a new telemetric device to individually adjust shunt valves according to ICP measurements.
   METHODS: Between December 2015 and November 2016, 25 patients with suspected suboptimal shunt valve settings underwent insertion of a telemetric ICP sensor (Sensor Reservoir; Christoph Miethke, Potsdam, Germany). Over a 1-year period, a total of 183 telemetric ICP measurements and 85 shunt valve adjustments were carried out. Retrospective statistic analyses focused on valve adjustments, ICP values, and clinical outcomes.
   RESULTS: ICP-guided valve adjustments positively changed the clinical state in 18 out of 25 patients. Clinical improvement over time was associated with significant changes of the valve settings and ICP values. Interestingly, a therapeutically normalized ICP profile was not automatically associated with clinical improvement.
   CONCLUSIONS: The Sensor Reservoir is an important and valuable tool for shunt-treated patients suffering from drainage-related problems. The possibility to simultaneously recognize and solve shunt problems represents the decisive advantage. Nevertheless, measurements with the Sensor Reservoir did not allow for the determination of default valve settings or universal target ICP values.

AB BACKGROUND: Hemodynamic factors impact cerebral aneurysm development and progression. Parent vessel architectural features, such as caliber, curvature, and angle, can affect downstream pressure and shear stress.
   OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between proximal parent vessel stenosis and aneurysm rupture status at the middle cerebral artery (MCA) bifurcation.
   METHODS: Catheter 3-dimensional rotational angiographic datasets from 69 Japanese patients with MCA aneurysms (58 unruptured/11 ruptured) were analyzed. The narrowest cross-sectional area of the M1 segment was evaluated through equidistant cross-sectional plane cuts along the M1 length. The degree of stenosis relative to M1 size (StenosisIndex) and the distance from stenosis to the aneurysm neck (StenosisAnDist) were statistically evaluated. The effects of StenosisIndex and StenosisAnDist were determined in parametric aneurysm models with/ without stenosis using computational fluid dynamic and fluidestructure interaction simulations.
   RESULTS: MCA harboring ruptured aneurysms had significantly greater StenosisIndex (0.31 +/- 0.21 vs. 0.17 +/- 0.14, P = 0.01), indicative of greater narrowing, and shorter StenosisAnDist (4.26 +/- 1.91 vs. 6.94 +/- 4.06 mm, P = 0.02) compared with unruptured aneurysms. Multivariate analysis combining StenosisIndex and StenosisAnDist resulted in P = 0.003, area under the curve = 0.81 (80% sensitivity, 74% specificity). Computational fluid dynamic and fluidestructure interaction simulations identified a synergetic effect of high stenosis and short StenosisAnDist in inducing greater aneurysm inflow velocity and deeper jet penetration, greater dome pressure, and greater tensile stress in the aneurysm wall.
   CONCLUSIONS: Ruptured status in bifurcation MCA aneurysms was associated with severity of proximal M1 stenosis and its proximity to the aneurysm neck, a novel risk factor, which acts by increasing aneurysm dome wall tension, and should be considered in investigations of rupture risk stratification.

AB BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Spinal bone metastases are common. They are mostly localized to the lumbar, thoracic, and cervical spine. The most common primaries to result in spinal metastases include lung, breast, and prostate carcinomas in adults as opposed to leukemia, Ewing sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and neuroblastoma in children. In patients diagnosed with cancer, bone metastases are found in 40% and spinal metastases in 10%. In this study, we reviewed 25 patients diagnosed with a spinal metastasis of unknown primary who presented with low back pain or acute-onset neurologic deficits and underwent operative treatment.
   METHODS: The retrospective study included 25 patients with a spinal metastasis of unknown primary who presented to our clinic with acute-onset vertebral fracture or neurologic deficit. Statistical descriptions were obtained for each patient. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method.
   RESULTS: The 25 patients included 17 men (68%) and 8 women (32%), with a mean age of 55 years (range, 14-81 years). Eleven patients (44%) presented with varying degrees of motor deficits ranging from flaccid paralysis to paraplegia. Motor deficits were completely reversed in 4 patients postoperatively. The tumors were localized to the upper thoracic spine (T1-4) in 2 patients, in the midthoracic spine (T5-8) in 2 patients, in the lower thoracic spine (T9-12) in 8 patients, in the cervical 7 in 1 patient, and in the lumbar spine in 12 patients. In 10 patients, the tumor affected multiple spinal regions. Nonosseous tumors were not present in 10 patients. Ten patients had an extradural tumor. Costal involvement was detected in 2 patients. The tumors were pathologically identified as lung cancer (n = 3), lymphoma (n = 5), breast cancer (n = 3), gastric cancer (n = 2), liver cancer (n = 2), prostate cancer (n = 2), renal cell carcinoma (n = 2), malignant melanoma (n = 1), plasmacytoma (n = 1), bladder cancer (n = 1), paraganglioma (n = 1), Ewing sarcoma (n = 1), and yolk sac carcinoma (n = 1). Posterior instrumentation was performed in patients with instability. In addition, decompression was performed in patients with neurologic deficit.
   CONCLUSIONS: Considering that 10% of patients with cancer are diagnosed by vertebral metastasis, presence of malignancy should be suspected and a detailed examination should be performed in patients presenting with vertebral fractures caused by no or minor trauma. Moreover, in patients presenting with neurologic deficit, soft tissue metastases leading to spinal cord compression should be kept inmind and further examinations should be promptly administered.

AB OBJECTIVE: Shunt surgery is common in pediatric neurosurgery and is associated with relevant complication rates. We aimed to compare previously published metrics in a single data set and propose the Negative Shunt Revision Rate (NSRR), defined as proportion of shunt explorations revealing a properly working system, as a new quality metric.
   METHODS: Retrospective analysis of our shunt surgery activity in 2015 was performed. Demographic, clinical, and radiologic variables were extracted from electronic medical notes. Surgical Activity Rate, Revision Quotient, 30-day shunt malfunction rate, 90-day global shunt revision rate, Preventable Shunt Revision Rate, and novel NSRR were calculated.
   RESULTS: Of 60 shunt operations analyzed, 18 (39%) were new shunt insertions, and 42 (70%) were revisions. Median age was 18 months (range, 0.03-204 months), and main etiologies were posthemorrhagic (n = 16; 41%), congenital (n = 11; 28%), and tumor-associated (n = 8; 21%) hydrocephalus. Within 90 days after index surgery, 13 shunt failures occurred, predominantly owing to proximal failure (n = 6; 46%). Surgical Activity Rate was 0.127, Revision Quotient was 2.333, 30-day shunt malfunction rate was 0.166, 90-day global shunt revision rate was 21.7%, and Preventable Shunt Revision Rate was 38.5%. NSRR was 7.1%.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results correlate with published values and offer measurement of quality that can be compared across studies and considered patient-oriented, easily measurable, and potentially modifiable. We propose NSRR as a new quality metric, covering an aspect of shunt surgery that was not addressed previously.

AB BACKGROUND: Endoscopic visualization does not necessarily correspond to an adequate working space. The need for balancing invasiveness and adequacy of sellar tumor exposure has recently led to the description of multiple endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal approaches. Comparative anatomic data on these variants are lacking.
   OBJECT: We sought to quantitatively compare endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal approaches to the sella and parasellar region, using the concept of "surgical pyramid."
   METHODS: Four endoscopic transsphenoidal approaches were performed in 10 injected specimens: 1) hemisphenoidotomy; 2) transrostral; 3) extended transrostral (with superior turbinectomy); and 4) extended transrostral with posterior ethmoidectomy. Approach-Viewer software (part of GTx-Eyes II, University Health Network, Toronto, Canada) with a dedicated navigation system was used to quantify the surgical pyramid volume, as well as exposure of sellar and parasellar areas. Statistical analyses were performed with Friedman's tests and Nemenyi's procedure.
   RESULTS: Hemisphenoidotomy provided limited exposure of the sellar area and a small working volume. A transrostral approach was necessary to expose the entire sella. Exposure of lateral parasellar areas required superior turbinectomy or posterior ethmoidectomy. The differences between each of the modules was statistically significant.
   CONCLUSION: The present study validates, from an anatomic point of view, a modular classification of endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal approaches to the sellar region.

AB OBJECTIVE: To present an algorithm based on clinical and radiologic factors, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) perfusion/diffusion mismatch (PDM), for the indication of urgent cerebral bypass in patients with acute ischemic stroke.
   METHODS: Clinical and radiologic data of 8 consecutive patients undergoing urgent cerebral revascularization for acute ischemic stroke owing to occlusion of internal carotid or middle cerebral artery between 2012 and 2015 were analyzed. All patients either were ineligible for or failed first-line treatment with emergent endovascular revascularization. Indication for urgent bypass was based on clinical worsening and MRI PDM, indicating threat for stroke extension. Clinical outcome was measured using National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and modified Rankin Scale before and after bypass surgery, at 3-month follow-up, and at last follow-up.
   RESULTS: All patients presented with clinical worsening after initiation of acute stroke treatment. Cerebral revascularization was performed 9.6 hours (SD 9.0) after clinical worsening. All patients had preoperative MRI PDM. No bypass complications, such as anastomosis failure or postoperative hemorrhage, occurred. MRI diffusion ratio before and after bypass was stable or improved in 7 patients and progressed in 1 patient without clinical worsening. MRI PDM and perfusion improved in all 4 patients who underwent postoperative MRI. Clinical outcome was favorable with a median improvement of 7 points on National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and of 2 points on modified Rankin Scale at last follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: Based on an algorithm indicating salvageable brain tissue, cerebral revascularization can be safely performed in an emergency setting in a highly selected group of patients with acute ischemic stroke with favorable clinical outcome.

AB OBJECTIVE: Although sagittal spinal balance plays an important role in spinal deformity surgery, its role in decompression surgery for lumbar canal stenosis is not well understood. To investigate the hypothesis that sagittal spinal balance also plays a role in decompression surgery for lumbar canal stenosis, a prospective cohort study analyzing the correlation between preoperative lumbar lordosis and outcome was performed.
   METHODS: A cohort of 85 consecutive patients who underwent decompression for lumbar canal stenosis during the period 2007-2011 was analyzed. Standing lumbar x-rays and 36-item short form health survey questionnaires were obtained before and up to 2 years after surgery. Correlations between lumbar lordosis and 2 parameters of the 36-item short form health survey (average physical score and bodily pain score) were statistically analyzed using linear mixed effects models.
   RESULTS: There was a significant correlation between preoperative lumbar lordosis and the 2 outcome parameters at postoperative, 6-month, 1-year, and 2-year time points. A 10 degrees increase of lumbar lordosis was associated with a 5-point improvement in average physical scores. This correlation was not present in preoperative scores.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that preoperative lumbar lordosis significantly influences the outcome of decompression surgery on lumbar canal stenosis.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate the ability of transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) to improve lumbar lordosis (LL).
   METHODS: In this retrospective study, 92 patients undergoing single-level TLIF to treat lumbar degenerative disease were divided into a low back pain, radiculopathy, and neurogenic claudication group according to their symptoms. Preoperative and postoperative measures, including segmental LL, whole LL, pelvic incidence (PI), pelvic tilt, thoracic kyphosis, sagittal vertical axis, visual analog scale for back and leg pain, and Oswestry Disability Index, were used to evaluate radiographic and clinical outcomes.
   RESULTS: All clinical parameters were significantly improved after TLIF. There was no significant difference in any radiographic parameters in the low back pain group. In the radiculopathy and neurogenic claudication groups, all radiographic parameters were significantly changed after TLIF except for segmental LL and PI in both groups and pelvic tilt in the radiculopathy group. No statistically significant differences were found in improvement of segmental LL, PI, thoracic kyphosis, and visual analog scale (leg) between the radiculopathy and neurogenic claudication groups, whereas the differences in improvement of whole LL, pelvic tilt, PI-LL, sagittal vertical axis, visual analog scale (back), and Oswestry Disability Index were significant between the 2 groups.
   CONCLUSIONS: For patients with neurogenic leg symptoms owing to single-level lumbar degenerative disease, whole LL was improved after TLIF as a result of spontaneous restoration of lordosis at the unfused lumbar levels.

AB BACKGROUND: Anterior transthoracic approaches, including thoracoscopic microdiscectomy (TMD), are the preferred techniques for central, broad-based, calcified thoracic disc herniations (TDHs). Dural defects due to manipulation or transdural extension may create a potentially life-threatening subarachnoid-pleural fistula. We evaluate a fast, sutureless technique for reconstructing the dura.
   METHODS: We analyzed 476 anterior transthoracic approaches for TDHs (437 TMDs, 31 mini-thoracotomies, 7 transaxillary approaches, and 1 sternotomy). Dural defects were closed using an onlay dura substitute, fibrin glue, an autologous fat graft, and another layer of fibrin glue topped by an absorbable gelatin sponge. A chest tube was used to provide a water seal, and the use of external lumbar drains (ELDs) was discontinued in recent years.
   RESULTS: We encountered 35 dural defects (7.35%), including 27 in 279 procedures (9.67%) in the first 10 years and 8 in 197 (4.06%) in the past 6 years. Five defects were large, 23 were relatively small, and 5 had an intact arachnoid layer, likely preventing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) egress. Two CSF leaks in the early series were overlooked intraoperatively; 1 patient died following widespread cortical venous thrombosis, whereas the other merely had a headache that disappeared within 1 week. Overall, an ELD was inserted in 3 of 5 large defects and in 17 of 23 small defects; however, in the past 6 years, an ELD was inserted in no large defects and in only 1 of 5 small defects. The technique was successful in all but 1 patient, who underwent reoperation using a larger fat graft.
   CONCLUSIONS: Dural defects encountered during anterior transthoracic approaches to TDHs can be reconstructed endoscopically, while avoiding the use of an ELD in most cases.

AB BACKGROUND: Corticosteroids are routinely used to treat brain tumors. Although steroids have an immediate clinical benefit, their use can lead to a number of relevant complications, and a negative association with overall survival has been shown in glioblastoma (GBM) patients. There is no evidence in the literature regarding the ideal dose. We assessed the use of steroids in patients with GBM after resection surgery.
   METHODS: This is a cohort study of 131 newly diagnosed GBM patients that underwent tumor resection surgery. Dose of steroids was as low as possible, without a formal guideline. Fifteen patients were lost at baseline (retention rate, 88.5%). Our population for analysis included 114 patients that were still at risk of death at a landmark time point 2months after surgery.
   RESULTS: Within 1 month of surgery, 93.9% of patients came off steroids, and 84.7% came off steroids before 2 weeks. One month after radiotherapy, 86 (75.4%) patients remained steroid-free and 28 (24.6%) were steroid-dependent. During 2235 person-months of follow-up, we documented 101 incident deaths. After adjusting for age, sex, Karnofsky Performance Scale score, MGMT promoter methylation, and extent of tumor resection, and time to surgery, the hazard ratio for the steroid-free group of patients was 0.46 (95% confidence interval, 0.28-0.77) compared with steroid-dependent patients.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence for an inverse association between the lack of steroid dependency and mortality risk in patients whose steroid dosage was rapidly tapered after surgery. After resection, most patients can stop steroids within 2 weeks and finish radiotherapy without steroids.

AB OBJECTIVE: The Simpson grading system has played an important role in surgical resections of meningiomas. The aim of this study was to determine if this grading system predicts meningioma recurrence in a modern cohort of patients with tumors of all World Health Organization grades.
   METHODS: Adult patients who underwent primary, nonbiopsy resection of a meningioma at a tertiary care institution between 2007 and 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. Stepwise multivariate proportional hazard analyses were used to identify associations with recurrence after resection. Log-rank analyses were used to compare Kaplan-Meier plots for time to recurrence between each Simpson grade.
   RESULTS: Of 572 patients who met inclusion criteria, 72 (12.6%) presented with recurrence. Factors associated with recurrence after gross total resection (Simpson grades I-III) were non-World Health Organization grade I (hazard ratio [HR] [95% confidence interval (CI)] 6.215 [2.864-12.419], P < 0.0001) and preoperative neurologic deficits (HR [95% CI] 2.862 [1.512-5.499], P = 0.001). Factors associated with recurrence after subtotal resections (Simpson IV) were African American race (HR [95% CI] 2.776 [1.232-5.890], P = 0.02) and parafalcine location (HR [95% CI] 3.956 [1.624-8.775], P = 0.004). Simpson grade was not an independent risk factor for recurrence.
   CONCLUSIONS: Identification and consideration of factors associated with recurrence after gross total or subtotal resections may help guide treatment strategies for patients with meningiomas.

AB OBJECTIVE: To clarify the clinical outcomes of cranioplasty with cryopreserved bone flaps and identify risk factors related to bone flap infection and resorption after cranioplasty with cryopreserved bone flaps.
   METHODS: A total of 946 patients (989 bone flaps) underwent decompressive craniectomy and delayed cranioplasty via the use of cryopreserved autogenous cranial bone flaps. Cranial bone flaps were removed during the initial craniectomy and reserved in liquid nitrogen (-196 degrees C) with dimethyl sulfoxide as a cryoprotectant. Cranioplasty subsequently was performed once the brain injury had healed. Data regarding complications and clinical outcomes were recorded and the potential risk factors were analyzed.
   RESULTS: Data from 960 flaps were available for analysis. The overall complication rate was 15.83% (152 of 960). Bone resorption occurred in 42 flaps in 37 patients (4.38%). The bone flaps resorption rate was greater in patients <= 18 years than in patients > 18 years (9.38% vs. 3.61%, P < 0.05). Cryopreservation for more than 365 days tended to result in a greater bone resorption rate (6.88% vs. 2.92%, P < 0.01). Skull bone grafts infection occurred in 39 flaps in 34 patients (4.06%). The bone graft infection rate was greater in emergency craniectomy cases (8.81% vs. 2.59%, P < 0.01) and in patients with diabetes (10.53% vs. 3.07%, P < 0.01).
   CONCLUSIONS: Cryopreservation of autologous cranial bone flaps is safe and effective for cranioplasty. Cranioplasty with cryopreserved autologous cranial bone flaps should be performed no more than 1 year after craniectomy. Emergency craniectomy and patients with diabetes require special attention.

AB BACKGROUND: Transsphenoid surgery (TSS) is a standard treatment modality for Cushing's disease (CD). However, postoperative remission and recurrence rates vary among studies. Here we analyze the diagnosis and outcomes of 341 patients with a preoperative diagnosis of CD undergoing TSS in a single center over a 3-year period.
   METHODS: A total of 341 patients were enrolled. Clinical manifestations, imaging results, laboratory workups, and results of inferior petrosal sinus sampling (IPSS) were obtained. Outcomes were obtained with a follow-up length from 12 to 36 months.
   RESULTS: The tumors were mainly of Knosp level 0 (68.57%). The sensitivity of MRI, combined low-dose and high-dose dexamethasone suppression test and IPSS in the diagnosis were 90.83%, 88.53% and 95.57%. The concordance of lateralization by MRI and by IPSS were 78.96% and 61.34% compared with surgery. 2. Outcomes. The overall remission rate was 78.89% (N=289). Patients undergoing the first TSS (N=234) had a remission rate of 86.36% for macroadenomas (N=22) and 83.2% for microadenomas (N=212). Patients undergoing a second TSS (N=55) had lower rate of remission of 50.00% for macroadenomas (N=6) and 61.22% for microadenomas (N=49). For patients with invasive tumors, the overall remission rate was 26.92% (N=26), 20.0% for macroadenomas (n=20) and 50.0% for microadenomas (N=6). The recurrence rate was 2.42%.
   CONCLUSIONS: Pituitary imaging, endocrinological workups and IPSS are sensitive and specific diagnostic modalities for CD, but the lateralization efficacy of MRI and IPSS are unsatisfactory. A higher rate of remission relies on gross resections of tumors.

AB OBJECTIVE: To compare the rates of recanalization and in-stent stenosis between the Enterprise (EP) and low-profile visualized intraluminal support (LVIS) stent deployments for intracranial aneurysms (IAs), and the factors associated therein.
   METHODS: Between June 2014 and July 2016, 142 patients with a total of 161 IAs were treated by LVIS stent-assisted coiling and 111 patients with a total of 142 IAs were treated by EP stent-assisted coiling at our institution. Procedure-related complications, angiographic follow-up results, and clinical outcomes were analyzed statistically.
   RESULTS: The rates of initially complete and near-complete IA occlusion immediately after the procedure were similar in the LVIS and EP groups (94.3% vs. 89.9%; P = 0.275). On follow-up, complete and near-complete occlusion rates and recanalization rates were also similar in the 2 groups (96.6% vs. 92.1%; P = 0.330 and 8.0% vs. 13.5%; P = 0.245, respectively). On logistic regression analysis, a higher size ratio (SR) was significantly associated with the recanalization of aneurysms in the EP group, but not in the LVIS group. The rate of moderate to severe in-stent stenosis was lower in the LVIS group (10.2%) than in the EP group (16.8%), but the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.198).
   CONCLUSIONS: Our data show acceptable rates of complete and near-complete occlusion with both the LVIS and EP stents. LVIS stents were associated with lower rates of recanalization and in-stent stenosis, but the difference was not significant. Higher SR (> 2) was a significant predictor of recanalization in IAs treated with EP stents, but not in those treated with LVIS stents.

   OUTCOMES; THERAPY
AB BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Contact aspiration has gained growing acceptance in endovascular stroke therapy. The safety and efficacy data of the novel ARC catheter (Medtronic, Irvine, California, USA) used for intracranial thrombectomy have been poorly evaluated thus far. We report our preliminary results with the ARC with regard to angiographic reperfusion, duration of thrombectomy, safety, and clinical outcome at 90 days.
   METHODS: In a single-center series including 20 large-vessel occlusion stroke patients who were collected prospectively, we retrospectively evaluated the safety and efficacy profiles of the ARC intracranial catheter for first-line contact aspiration. Successful reperfusion was defined as modified Thrombolysis in Cerebrovascular Infarction (mTICI) scores 2b-3 at final angiogram and functional independence as modified Rankin Scale score 0-2 at 90 days.
   RESULTS: Median admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 15, and previous intravenous thrombolysis was administered in 12 patients (60%). Proximal occlusion was located in the anterior circulation in 16 patients (80%). Primary aspiration alone was successful in 10 of 15 patients (67%) within a median time of 26 minutes. Overall successful reperfusion was achieved in 16 patients (80%) within a median time of 31 minutes. There were no device-related events. Median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 2.5 at discharge. Six of 17 patients (35%) were independent, and 6 (35%) died at 90 days. Symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage occurred in 5%.
   CONCLUSIONS: In our initial experience, the ARC appears safe and efficient for contact aspiration thrombectomy in large-vessel stroke therapy. However, improvement of its distal navigability needs further development to improve the success of aspiration alone, and large prospective studies are warranted.

AB OBJECTIVE: To determine whether opioids during the first 24 postoperative hours were significantly altered when receiving intravenous (IV) acetaminophen during that time compared with those receiving placebo (normal saline).
   METHODS: One hundred forty patients undergoing any type of craniotomy were randomly assigned to receive either 1 g of IV acetaminophen or placebo upon surgical closure, and every 6 hours thereafter, up to 18 hours post-operatively. Analgesic requirements for the first 24 postoperative hours were recorded. Time to rescue medications in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU)/intensive care unit (ICU), amount of rescue medication, ICU and hospital lengths of stay, number of successful neurological examinations, sedation, delirium, satisfaction, and visual analog scale pain scores were also recorded.
   RESULTS: Compared with the placebo group, more patients in the IV acetaminophen group (10/66 [15.2%] vs. 4/65 [6.2%] in the placebo group) did not require opioids within the first 24 postoperative hours, but this did not reach significance (odds ratio, -9.0%, 95% confidence interval -20.5% to 1.8%; P = 0.166). Both groups had similar times to rescue medications, amounts of rescue medications, ICU and hospital lengths of stay, numbers of successful neurological examinations, sedation, delirium, satisfaction scores, visual analog scale pain scores, and temperatures within the first 24 postoperative hours.
   CONCLUSIONS: The opioid requirements within the first 24 postoperative hours were similar in the placebo and acetaminophen groups. This study is informative for the design and planning of future studies investigating the management of postoperative pain in patients undergoing craniotomies.

   OUTCOMES
AB OBJECTIVE: Treatment of ruptured posterior circulation dissecting aneurysms is technically challenging with potentially high morbidity and mortality. We sought to assess the safety and feasibility of using a flow-diversion device (FDD) and a specific acute antiplatelet aggregation protocol in the management of ruptured dissecting aneurysms.
   METHODS: Subjects with ruptured dissecting aneurysms treated during a 3-year period were retrospectively identified from a prospective registry. Intraoperative complications, morbidity, and mortality were recorded. Tirofiban maintenance infusion without bolus was administered intravenously immediately after deployment of the FDD, and almost all patients were loaded with dual antiplatelet (aspirin and clopidogrel) post procedure. Clinical follow-up evaluation and modified Rankin Scale were assessed.
   RESULTS: Nine subjects with ruptured posterior circulation dissecting aneurysms were treated with an FDD: 5 vertebral artery, 2 basilar artery, and 2 posterior inferior cerebellar artery aneurysms. Average World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies score was 2 (range 1-5). Seven patients had external ventricular drain placed acutely for hydrocephalus. Eight patients received tirofiban infusion without bolus after FDD. No intraoperative complications occurred. Two subjects developed asymptomatic intraparenchymal hemorrhage found on surveillance noncontrast computed tomography. One subject suffered a major intraparenchymal hemorrhage and died a few days post intervention after additional anticoagulation was started for a left ventricular assist device. Follow-up modified Rankin Scale within 12 months was 0 in 3 subjects, 1 in 3 subjects, 2 in 1 subject, and 4 in 1.
   CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of dissecting posterior circulation aneurysms with FDDs is feasible and a potential alternative to deconstructive techniques.

DT Article
DE Decision curve analysis; Intracerebral hemorrhage; Prognosis; Prognostic

ID GRADING SCALE; SCORE
AB OBJECTIVE: Numerous scores have been developed for prognostication of outcomes in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Prediction models must be validated internally and externally before they are considered widely applicable. We aim to independently externally validate and compare 3 prediction models (ICH score, ICH grading scale [ICH-GS], and simplified ICH [sICH]) in our population, which has not been previously done.
   METHODS: We reviewed 1338 patients with spontaneous ICH consecutively admitted to the National Neuroscience Institute, Singapore, between January 2009 and November 2013. We analyzed prospectively collected data of admission characteristics (clinical, neuroimaging, and laboratory findings). All 3 scores prognosticated 30-day mortality. Validation was based on calibration, goodness-of-fit tests, and discrimination (area under receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC]). Akaike information criterion (AIC) and decision curve analysis (DCA) were used to directly compare the scores.
   RESULTS: All 3 models showed good calibration and both the Hosmer-Lemeshow and the le Cessie-van Houwelingen-Copas goodness-of-fit test showed P values >0.05. AUCs ranged from 0.86 to 0.90, indicating good discriminative ability, with the ICH-GS performing the best with the highest AUC, lowest AIC (849), and overall highest net benefit in the DCA.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study successfully independently validates the ICH score, ICH-GS, and sICH score in a large patient cohort with spontaneous ICH, which has not been previously done in this non-Western population. We recommend the use of the ICH-GS as a prognostication tool in our patients instead of the widely used ICH score.

   METHODS: The outcomes of 561 elderly and nonelderly patients who underwent SRS for AVM at our institution between 1990 and 2013 were reviewed, analyzed, and compared. Elderly patients were defined as those age >= 60 years at the time of SRS.
   RESULTS: The elderly cohort comprised 55 patients; the nonelderly cohort, 506. In the elderly cohort, the median age was 65 years, and the duration of follow-up was 91 months. The actuarial obliteration rates were 47% at 3 years, 70% at 4 years, and 76% at 5 years in the elderly cohort, and 57% at 3 years, 76% at 4 years, and 83% at 5 years in the nonelderly cohort. In the elderly cohort, the hemorrhage rates during the post-SRS latent phase were 5.2%/year in patients with hemorrhagic onset and 0%/year in those with nonhemorrhagic onset, and event-free survival (EFS) was 93% at 6 years and 89% at 12 years. The obliteration rate, mortality, and EFS rate were not significantly different between the 2 cohorts, whereas the rate of perifocal edema was significantly lower (P = 0.021) in the elderly cohort. The pre-SRS and post-SRS hemorrhage rates were slightly higher in the elderly cohort, albeit without statistical significance.
   CONCLUSIONS: Therapeutic effects and outcomes of SRS are similar in elderly and nonelderly patients. Treatment-related neurologic deficits are rare, and longer EFS can be expected.

AB OBJECTIVE: Only a few anatomic studies of the entire course of the hypoglossal nerve (cranial nerve XII) have been reported. We analyzed all relationships of the 12th nerve with surrounding structures from the brainstem to the tongue through a microscopic perspective. A comprehensive anatomically and clinically oriented classification of its different segments is proposed.
   METHODS: Ten formalin-fixed adult human cadaveric heads (20 sides) were dissected with the aim to explore the entire course of cranial nerve XII via lateral suboccipital, far lateral partial, or total transcondylar routes. Different segments of the nerve were identified based on the hypoglossal course and its relationship with surrounding structures. Measurements of every portion of the nerve were taken in all specimens during dissection.
   RESULTS: The hypoglossal nerve was divided into 5 segments: cisternal, intracanalar, descending, horizontal, and ascending. Detailed and comprehensive examination of basic anatomic relationships through the view of different transcranial and endoscope-assisted approaches was performed. A new perspective of the hypoglossal canal is proposed, and the venous plexus surrounding the intracanalar segment of the nerve is described in detail.
   CONCLUSIONS: Classification of 5 segments for the hypoglossal nerve seems anatomically valid, and it is surgically oriented with respect to all surgical approaches. Precise knowledge of the relationships with the surrounding structures may help to prevent some complications during surgery, and it is useful to explain, segment by segment, the pathogenic mechanisms for nerve injuries that are evidenced by lesions that exist along the entire intracranial and extracranial course.

AB BACKGROUND: Arachnoid cysts and intracranial aneurysms are not rare, but it is unusual for an aneurysm to be associated with an arachnoid cyst. The objective of this study was to reveal the association between arachnoid cysts and intracranial aneurysms.
   METHODS: Methods included to report 3 cases with these 2 pathologies and to perform a systematic review of the English and Japanese literature using PubMed, Scopus, and Ichushi Web.
   RESULTS: The first case was of a 46-year-old man with a subarachnoid hemorrhage on the basal cistern and bilateral arachnoid cysts in the middle fossa, the second was that of a 29-year-old woman with a subarachnoid hemorrhage at the basal cistern and an arachnoid cyst in the left middle fossa, and the third was that of a 60-year-old man with a right putaminal hemorrhage and contralateral unruptured aneurysm and arachnoid cyst. A literature search for similar cases found 27 patients.
   CONCLUSIONS: It was difficult to diagnose a ruptured aneurysm in some cases with an arachnoid cyst because computed tomography scan showed atypical findings, such as no hemorrhage, intracystic localized hemorrhage, or subdural hematoma. This review revealed that aneurysms and arachnoid cysts were significantly located ipsilaterally and that they occurred together in relatively young patients.

AB BACKGROUND: Although most posterior communicating artery (PCoA) aneurysms can be clipped easily with excellent results, some require anterior clinoidectomy for safe and complete clipping.
   OBJECTIVE: To review our microsurgical series of ruptured PCoA aneurysms and identify the preoperative predictors for anterior clinoidectomy during microsurgical clipping for PCoA aneurysms.
   METHODS: Results from microsurgical clipping of 104 patients with ruptured PCoA aneurysms were reviewed retrospectively. Distances and angles were obtained from computed tomographic angiography and compared between the anterior and nonanterior clinoidectomy groups.
   RESULTS: Anterior clinoidectomy was required in 19 of the 104 cases (18%). None developed surgical complications due to anterior clinoid process (ACP) resection, including postoperative visual deficit. Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that the distances from the ACP tip to the aneurysmal proximal neck and from the ACP line to the aneurysmal proximal neck were statistically significant predictive factors for the need of anterior clinoidectomy. Based on a receiver operating characteristic analysis, the distances from the ACP tip to the aneurysmal proximal neck <4.0 mm and from the ACP line to the aneurysmal proximal neck <= 2.0 mm were selected as optimal cutoff values for predicting the necessity of anterior clinoidectomy, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values were 0.991 and 0.955, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: In case of ruptured PCoA aneurysm surgery, the distances from the ACP tip to the aneurysmal proximal neck and from the ACP line to the aneurysmal proximal neck were both found to be useful predictors of whether anterior clinoidectomy was required.

AB BACKGROUND: Awake craniotomy is performed with increasing frequency for brain tumor surgery in eloquent areas; however, little is known about patients' memories of this procedure. Here we retrospectively analyzed the quality and quantity of memories in a series of patients treated following a standardized protocol.
   METHODS: We treated 61 consecutive patients within 3 years, 48 of whom were alive when the study was performed. Each of these patients received a questionnaire eliciting information about their perioperative memories and perceptions. The perioperative process was broken down into steps, and for each step the patient was to judge the quantity (nothing-everything) and quality (very negative-every positive) of his or her memories.
   RESULTS: Thirty-six of the 48 patients completed the questionnaire (75%). The quantity of memories was quite incomplete, even for intraoperative moments when patients were awake and cooperative. On average, the quality of memories was neutral or positive. A higher quantity of memories was associated with a higher quality of memories. The most commonly reported sources of discomfort were placement of the Mayfield clamp, followed by laying on the operating room table with movement restriction, and irritation by the urinary catheter in situ.
   CONCLUSIONS: Awake craniotomy can be performed following our protocol in such a way that it is experienced as (very) comfortable. However, there are moments of discomfort, which can be managed by the team. Extensive preoperative preparation may be considered a crucial part of the procedure. Less amnesia seems to improve patient satisfaction. The results of this study can help guide protocol optimization, expectation management, and information for future patients.

AB OBJECTIVE: Open surgical access to the posterior fossa traditionally has been achieved by permanent bone removal and remains the mainstay of posterior fossa surgery, although craniotomy is an alternative. Considerable variation exists at both the national and international levels within a variety of neurologic and neurosurgical disciplines. In this study, we surveyed current practice patterns regarding preference of suboccipital craniotomy or craniectomy.
   METHODS: The membership directory of the American Academy of Neurological Surgeons was reviewed. SurveyMonkey was used to distribute the survey to members of the American Academy of Neurological Surgeons via a modified Dillman method for e-mail correspondence. Comparisons of frequency distributions, means, and medians, as well as multiple logistic regression were used to determine surgical preferences for craniotomy versus craniectomy.
   RESULTS: We received 1102 responses (19.6%). Overall, 542 (49.7%) respondents prefer craniotomy and 548 (50.3%) prefer craniectomy. Respondents who prefer craniotomy had completed a residency more recently than respondents who preferred craniectomy (15.9 vs. 21.1 years, P < 0.0001) and were more likely to practice outside of North America (P < 0.01). Some 81.4% of pediatric neurosurgeons prefer craniotomy compared with 43.6% of adult neurosurgeons (P < 0.0001). Craniotomy was most highly preferred for tumor resection and vascular malformation. Within the United States, there was significant variation in preference for craniotomy based on geographic region, with New England most commonly preferring craniotomy and the Mid-Atlantic region most commonly preferring craniectomy.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that preference for suboccipital craniotomy or craniectomy varies according to geographic location of practice, time since completing residency, and age of patient population.

AB OBJECTIVE: Chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) is a commonly encountered neurosurgical pathology that frequently requires operative intervention. With an increasing ageing demographic, more elderly and comorbid patients will present with symptomatic CSDH. This study evaluated clinical and radiologic factors to create a scoring system to aid prognostication.
   METHODS: A cohort of patients undergoing evacuation of CSDH at a single institution was established from 2010 to 2015. Primary endpoint was a dichotomized score on a modified Rankin Scale score at 1-year follow-up (favorable outcome score 0-1; unfavorable outcome score 2-6). Logistic regression analyses were performed to model determinants related to outcome. A prediction rule for diagnosing poor postoperative prognosis with unfavorable modified Rankin Scale score was developed with the obtained results.
   RESULTS: Logistic regression analyses showed that age > 75 years, midline shift > 10 mm, and hematoma thickness > 30 mm were significantly associated with unfavorable outcome (age > 75 years: odds ratio [OR] 0.01, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.001-0.01; midline shift 11-20 mm: OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.04-0.88; midline shift > 20 mm: OR 0.03, 95% CI 0.002-0.41; hematoma thickness > 30 mm: OR 0.07, 95% CI 0.01-0.46). A scoring system was designed using the final fitted multivariate model. A minimum score of 3 is feasible, indicating worst prognosis, and maximum score of 13 is feasible, indicating best prognosis. A score of >= 9 showed favorable outcome. Receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed to predict favorable versus unfavorable outcomes with the sensitivity analysis yielding an excellent model discrimination with an area under curve of 0.95, 95% CI 0.92-0.98.
   CONCLUSIONS: A scoring system has been devised to predict outcome, which can aid in the necessity of surgery in certain patient demographics.

ID HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; ACUTE ISCHEMIC-STROKE; BAROREFLEX SENSITIVITY;
   BLOOD-PRESSURE; FAILURE
AB BACKGROUND: Reduced baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) has been reported in patients with acute cardiovascular events. We tested the hypothesis that BRS is substantially reduced in patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and that BRS can predict treatment outcomes.
   METHODS: We examined BRS and other cardiovascular autonomic parameters in 35 patients with ICH over the course of 30 days. Cardiovascular autonomic parameters also were evaluated in 30 healthy volunteer subjects during the study period. Outcome was assessed at 30 days with the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Good outcome was defined as an mRS < 1, whereas patients defined as having a poor outcome had either an mRS >= 2 or died shortly after the stroke event.
   RESULTS: Twenty patients had a poor outcome, and 15 patients had a good outcome. BRS values in the patients with poor outcome group were lower in comparison with the healthy subjects, and BRS values in patients with poor outcomes were significantly lower than that those in patients with good outcomes on day 1, day 4, and day 10. BRS was associated independently with outcome and the cut-off value of BRS on day 1 in the poor outcome group was 6.79.
   CONCLUSIONS: Based on our results, BRS value at admission is a more powerful predictor of outcome than the Glasgow Coma Scale score at admission. An assay of BRS could be added as a biomarker for outcome prediction among patients with spontaneous ICH in clinical practice.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of interlaminar epidural steroid injection (ESI) for management of central cervical spinal stenosis-induced posterior neck pain.
   METHODS: This retrospective study recruited 45 patients with posterior neck pain caused by central cervical spinal stenosis. For the ESI procedure, a 21-gauge Touhy needle was inserted into the epidural space between C7 and T1, and 20 mg (40 mg/mL) of dexamethasone with 4 mL of normal saline was injected. The effect of the procedure was evaluated using a numerical rating scale at 1, 2, and 3 months after the procedure. Successful pain relief was defined as reduction in numerical rating scale score of >= 50% compared with before treatment. At 3 months after treatment, patient satisfaction levels were examined; patients who reported very good (score = 7) or good results (score = 6) were considered to be satisfied with the procedure.
   RESULTS: Posterior neck pain was significantly reduced at follow-up evaluation 1, 2, and 3 months after ESI (P < 0.001, repeated measures 1-factor analysis). At 3 months after the procedure, 58% of the patients achieved a successful response (>= 50% pain reduction), and 56% were satisfied with treatment results.
   CONCLUSIONS: Cervical interlaminar ESI appears to be a good treatment method for managing chronic posterior neck pain induced by central cervical spinal stenosis, especially when pain is refractory to oral medication.

AB OBJECTIVES: There was no consensus regarding the treatment of intracranial chondrosarcoma (CSA). The study aimed to evaluate the adverse factors for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) and to propose a treatment strategy for CSA.
   METHODS: The clinical chart and radiographic data of 106 consecutive cases (mesenchymal and conventional CSA in 18 and 88 patients, respectively) of surgically treated CSAs were retrospectively reviewed.
   RESULTS: Gross total resection was achieved in 43 patients (40.6%), and adjuvant radiotherapy was administered in 45 patients. After a mean follow-up duration of 47.8 months, 38 patients (37.3%) experienced recurrence. PFS and disease-specific OS at 5 years was 57.7% and 74.4%. Independent adverse factors for PFS were previous surgery (hazard ratio [HR] 2.261; P = 0.028), increased lesion size (HR, 1.298; P = 0.026), extent of surgical resection (HR, 3.226; P < 0.001), malignant pathology (HR, 2.018; P= 0.003), and postoperative radiotherapy (HR, 3.246; P = 0.001). The stereotactic radiosurgery subgroup presented best 5-year PFS of 88.9%, and a linear accelerator prolonged the mean PFS time (57.0 months) compared with no radiation (38.1 months). In the incomplete resection subgroup (n = 63), radiotherapy significantly benefited tumor control (HR, 2.101; P = 0.016). Extent of surgical resection (HR, 1.797; P = 0.026) and malignant disease (HR, 1.717; P = 0.030) were associated with OS.
   CONCLUSIONS: Intracranial CSAs were not completely amendable by surgery alone. Gross total resection as far as possible plus radiation were necessary for mesenchymal CSA and conventional CSA with active growth or residual tumor. Stereotactic radiosurgery was an alternative if proton therapy was unavailable. A future study with a large cohort is required to verify our findings.

   GUIDELINES
AB BACKGROUND: Ultra-early surgical clot removal relieves mechanical compression on adjacent normal brain tissue and limits the toxic effects of a hematoma, which might improve the outcomes in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH); however, hematoma expansion frequently occurs within 20 hours after the ictus, and this limits the use of ultra-early surgery. Computed tomography angiography spot sign was recently validated as an important predictor of hematoma expansion in patients with ICH.
   METHODS: Fifty-nine patients with ICH and negative spot sign who received ultra-early stereotactic aspiration (<6 hours after ictus; n = 32 [Ultra-early group]) or routine stereotactic aspiration (>= 6 hours after ictus; n = 27 [Routine group]) were included in retrospective analysis.
   RESULTS: The percentage of rebleeding was not significantly different between the 2 groups. Perihematoma edema 7 days after surgery in the Ultra-early group was significantly less frequent than that in the Routine group. For long-term outcomes, the proportion of patient fatalities and Glasgow Outcome Scale score were not significantly different between the 2 groups; however, for patients with severe symptoms, the rate of good neurological outcome in the Ultra-early group was higher than that in the Routine group.
   CONCLUSIONS: Ultra-early stereotactic aspiration might decrease the volume of perihematoma edema and improve the functional outcomes to some extent, without increasing the recurrence of ICH and patient fatalities. Our findings suggest that using negative spot sign as an indicator for performing ultra-early stereotactic aspiration could be a safe and effective protocol for ICH patients.

   COILING; FLOW DISRUPTION; SERIES; FEASIBILITY
AB BACKGROUND: The experience with Woven EndoBridge (WEB) device is still limited. The aim of this study is to discuss the efficacy of this new device, focusing on any anatomical and procedural factors influencing aneurysm occlusion.
   METHODS: Between October 2011 and November 2016, 24 patients (10 female, 14 male) harboring 24 cerebral aneurysms treated with WEB in a single center were retrospectively reviewed. Patients underwent 6-month and 12- to 24-month (median 18 months) clinical and neuroradiologic follow-up. We evaluated whether any procedural or anatomical aspect influenced the occlusion rate.
   RESULTS: Adequate occlusion (AO) was achieved in 68% of cases at 6 months' and in 87% at 18 months' follow-up respectively. Technical difficulties occurred in 3 procedures (12.5%). No postprocedural morbidity was reported. One patient (4%) died after 1 month for reasons unrelated to the procedure. Neck size and dome-to-neck ratio were significantly associated with aneurysm occlusion (P < 0.05). AO was not associated with postoperative dual antiplatelet therapy (P > 0.99) or device compression at both first and second follow-up (P > 0.99). Immediate contrast agent stagnation was more common in aneurysms that were occluded at first (P = 0.37) and second follow-up (P = 0.24), but statistical significance was not reached.
   CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular treatment with WEB is a safe treatment for unruptured cerebral aneurysms, also resulting in a good AO rate in aneurysms that would otherwise require complex assisted coiling techniques. However, results are less favorable in cases of very large aneurysmal neck. Nevertheless, further series with larger patient populations and longer follow-up will define the role of WEB in the treatment of aneurysms.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate the factors associated with the recovery process of elderly patients after degenerative lumbar scoliosis surgery.
   METHODS: A total of 213 elderly patients who had undergone surgical treatment for degenerative lumbar scoliosis from 2011 to 2015 were included retrospectively in this study. Clinical data and demographics were collected for logistic regression analysis.
   RESULTS: Among 213 eligible patients, 77 (38.5%) were classified as being in the excellent group, 70 (35%) as showing improvement, 24 (12%) as showing no change, and 29 (14.5%) as having deteriorated. At baseline, patients differed significantly from matched normative data in all Scoliosis Research Society domains. Larger differences from normative values were found for pain and activity domains. After surgery, each domain improved significantly. In the multivariate logistic regression, age 60-70 years (odds ratio [OR], 2.431; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.143-5.174), and American Society of Anesthesiologists grade <3 (OR, 2.987; 95% CI, 1.519-5.874) may be predictive factors for a satisfying recovery, whereas presence of complications (OR, 0.342; 95% CI, 0.153-0.765), fusion to the sacrum (OR, 0.200; 95% CI, 0.076-0.523), and more osteotomies (OR, 0.360; 95% CI, 0.132-0.985) have negative effects on the recovery process.
   CONCLUSIONS: The factors that affect postoperative recovery in elderly patients with degenerative lumbar scoliosis are age, American Society of Anesthesiologists grade, distal fusion level, presence of complications, and number of osteotomies.

AB OBJECTIVE: This study was performed to evaluate the efficiency of Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) on reducing recurrence of World Health Organization (WHO) grade II meningiomas after surgery and to define the risk factors associated with tumor recurrence/progression and patient's death.
   METHODS: This retrospective study included 75 patients who were diagnosed with WHO grade II meningiomas after initial surgery. The Kaplan-Meier method with a log-rank test was used to calculate the survival curves. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards model were used to identify the risk factors associated with tumor recurrence/progression and patient's death.
   RESULTS: The median follow-up period was 70 months. The overall survival (OS) was 97.2% at 2 years and 89.8% at 5 years. The progression-free survival (PFS) at 1, 3, and 5 years was 89.3%, 72.6%, and 59.3%, respectively. Comparing the effects on PFS and OS between different groups, there were no statistically significant differences between the surgery-alone group and the surgery with adjuvant/salvage GKS group (P = 0.512; P = 0.949). In multivariate Cox proportional hazards model analysis, extent of resection (P= 0.001) and tumor location (P= 0.015) were associated with tumor recurrence; only histologic subtypes (P = 0.005) were associated with patient's death.
   CONCLUSIONS: There was no significant PFS or OS benefit for patients with WHO grade II meningiomas treated with adjuvant/salvage GKS postoperatively. Convexity meningiomas with gross total resection tended to benefit PFS. We suggest trying to achieve maximum safe gross total resection for patients with WHO grade II meningiomas, then following up closely.

AB OBJECTIVE: The feasibility and prognosis of surgical treatment for children with optic pathway gliomas (OPGs) is controversial. Therefore this study attempted to evaluate the effects of surgery and discuss prognostic factors related to the survival of children with symptomatic OPGs.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: One-hundred twenty-five children diagnosed with OPGs underwent surgery in the Department of Neurosurgery, Beijing Tiantan Hospital from 2003-2016. In this retrospective study, their demographics, clinical characteristics, treatments, and survival outcomes were investigated and summarized.
   RESULTS: Among the 125 patients, the 5-year overall survival (OS) rate and progression-free survival (PFS) rate were 84.1% and 70.6%, respectively. In the univariate analysis, patients who received postoperative radiotherapy (RT) after surgery had significantly better 5-year OS and PFS rates than patients who did not receive RT (P < 0.001 for both comparisons), patients who were 3 years old had better PFS rates than younger patients (P < 0.001), and patients with endocrinology symptoms had significantly worse PFS rates than patients with other symptoms (P [0.049). In the multiple regression analysis, postoperative treatment with RT and tumors with a lower pathologic grade were better predictors of OS. An age older than 3 years and postoperative treatment with RT were better predictors of PFS.
   CONCLUSIONS: Surgery is safe and feasible for children with large volumes of OPGs and symptoms of functional impairment and obstructive hydrocephalus. Furthermore, adjuvant RT after surgery may significantly improve OS and PFS. The pathologic grade is an independent prognostic factor for OS, and the age at diagnosis is an independent prognostic factor for PFS.

AB BACKGROUND: Fibrous dysplasia (FD) of the skull base can manifest with optic nerve compression. As most patients initially do not experience vision loss, controversy exists whether to proceed with prophylactic surgical decompression or elect for conservative observation. Optical coherence tomography (OCT), a physiologic imaging modality widely used to assess the condition of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), has been useful in monitoring compressive tumors on the optic nerve. This study evaluated potential use of OCT in management of patients with fibrous dysplasia and optic nerve involvement.
   METHODS: Six patients with suspected optic nerve compression who underwent OCT imaging as part of a neuro-ophthalmic examination were reviewed over a 2-year period. Patient records were evaluated for visual examination measures, most notably the presence of optic neuropathy, and radiographic measures on computed tomography. Measures were compared by age-adjusted RNFL thickness (above or below fifth percentile) on OCT imaging.
   RESULTS: Two patients were found to have mild optic neuropathy in 1 eye each. Three of 12 eyes fell below the age-adjusted fifth percentile of RNFL thickness. Presence of optic neuropathy was associated with abnormal ageadjusted RNFL thickness but not with optic nerve compression (P = 0.45).
   CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal RNFL thickness as measured by OCT better predicted the presence of optic neuropathy than computed tomography alone. OCT may be a valuable imaging modality to monitor patients with fibrous dysplasia for development of optic neuropathy during periods of conservative watchful waiting.

AB BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Early recanalization of acute posterior circulation stroke caused by large intracranial vessel occlusion by mechanical thrombectomy with stent retrievers may improve the outcome of patients. However, evidence of patient selection is still lacking. This study investigated the prognostic factors of acute posterior circulation stroke caused by large intracranial arterial occlusion when treated with stent-retriever thrombectomy.
   METHODS: A total of 69 patients from March 2012 to November 2016 were included in the study. These patients presented with acute posterior circulation stroke caused by large intracranial vessel occlusion and underwent mechanical thrombectomy with Solitaire AB or combined with additional balloon and/or stenting angioplasty. Baseline characteristics, clinical course, and imaging data of the patients were analyzed. Good clinical outcome (defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 0-2 at 90 days) and safety outcome (defined as death within 90 days after thrombectomy) were considered as end points. The association between factors with good clinical outcome and safety outcome was evaluated with both logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic curve analyses.
   RESULTS: Of the 69 patients, mean age was 59 years (standard deviation, 8 years) and men comprised 82.6% (57/69). The median onset-to-treatment time was 360 minutes (interquartile range, 250-537 minutes). The median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 25 (interquartile range, 17-30) on admission. Successful recanalization was achieved in 62 of the 69 cases (89.9%) and 36.2% (25/69) were independent at 90 days. Regression analysis showed that stroke subtype (intracranial atherosclerotic disease vs. embolism; odds ratio [OR], 0.101; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.020-0.501; P = 0.005), baseline NIHSS score (>= 22 vs. <22; OR, 0.157; 95% CI, 0.040-0.614; P = 0.008) and posterior circulation Acute Stroke Prognosis Early CT Score (pc-ASPECTS) on diffusion-weighted imaging [DWI] (weighted magnetic resonance imaging) before thrombectomy (>= 6 vs. <6; OR, 7.335; 95% CI, 1.495-36.191; P = 0.014) were independent predictive factors of good clinical outcome, respectively at 90 days, whereas high NIHSS score (>= 30 vs. < 30; OR, 5.569; 95% CI, 1.573-19.716; P = 0.008) and collateral status (>= 2 vs. <2; OR, 0.210; 95% CI, 0.059-0.752; P = 0.016) before treatment were associated with mortality at 90 days. Based on receiver operating characteristic curves, baseline NIHSS score (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.779; cutoff, >= 22; P < 0.001; sensitivity, 72%; specificity, 77.3%), pc-ASPECTS on DWI (AUC = 0.820; cutoff, >= 6; P < 0.001; sensitivity, 72%; specificity, 77.3%) before treatment were independent indicators predicting good clinical outcome at 90 days. Increased risk of death by 90 days was associated with baseline NIHSS score (AUC = 0.719; cutoff, >= 30; P = 0.007; sensitivity, 64.7%; specificity, 78.9%) and worse collateral status (AUC = 0.820; cutoff, >= 2; P < 0.001; sensitivity, 58.8%; specificity, 80.8%) before treatment.
   CONCLUSIONS: Stroke subtype, initial stroke severity, and pc-ASPECTS on DWI as well as collateral status before thrombectomy are independent factors affecting the clinical outcome in patients treated with Solitaire AB thrombectomy for acute posterior circulation stroke caused by large intracranial vessel occlusion.

AB OBJECTIVE: To compare clinical outcomes at 1 year following single-level lumbar microdiscectomy in daily tobacco smokers and nonsmokers.
   METHODS: Data were collected through the Norwegian Registry for Spine Surgery. The primary endpoint was a change in the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) at 1 year. Secondary endpoints were change in quality of life measured with EuroQol 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D), leg and back pain measured with a numerical rating scale (NRS), and rates of surgical complications.
   RESULTS: A total of 5514 patients were enrolled, including 3907 nonsmokers and 1607 smokers. A significant improvement in ODI was observed for the entire cohort (mean, 31.1 points; 95% confidence interval [CI], 30.4-31.8; P < 0.001). Nonsmokers experienced a greater improvement in ODI at 1 year compared with smokers (mean, 4.1 points; 95% CI, 2.5-5.7; P < 0.001). Nonsmokers were more likely to achieve a minimal important change (MIC), defined as an ODI improvement of >= 10 points, compared with smokers (85.5% vs. 79.5%; P < 0.001). Nonsmokers experienced greater improvements in EQ-5D (mean difference, 0.068; 95% CI, 0.04-0.09; P < 0.001), back pain NRS (mean difference, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.21-0.66; P < 0.001), and leg pain NRS (mean difference, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.31-0.77; P < 0.001). There was no difference between smokers and nonsmokers in the overall complication rate (6.2% vs. 6.7%; P = 0.512). Smoking was identified as a negative predictor for ODI change in a multiple regression analysis (P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: Nonsmokers reported a greater improvement in ODI at 1 year following microdiscectomy, and smokers were less likely to experience an MIC. Nonetheless, significant improvement was also found among smokers.

ID EXPERIENCE; SIMULATION; PERFORMANCE; MODELS
AB INTRODUCTION: Self-made devices composed of agar and gelatin gel were used for resident training in intraaxial brain tumor resection. The mixture gel of agar and gelatin is retractable and can be suctioned. Hardness of the gel depends on the concentration of the solution. Therefore, by changing the concentration, it is easy to make gels of various hardness.
   METHODS: In this study, a mass of gel that looked like a tumor was placed into another gel that looked like the brain. A part of the "brain" was regarded as the eloquent area. Three types of "tumor" were prepared: hard, moderately hard, and soft tumors. Residents tried to remove the tumor entirely with minimal brain invasion. The training was repeated with 3 types of gel. After resection, the weight of the residual tumor, resected normal brain, and resected eloquent area were measured, and the time taken for removal was recorded.
   RESULTS: These data were compared between residents and neurosurgeons. We also analyzed how these data improved with repeated practice. In most cases, residual tumor, resected normal brain, resected eloquent area, and time taken for removal were less in neurosurgeons than in residents. Repeated training made residents more skillful. The responses of the trainees were almost all favorable.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our devices with " tumors" of various hardness appear to be suitable for resident training in each surgical skill. For the next step of this study, we will attempt to fabricate more practical 3-dimensional gel models for presurgical simulation.

AB BACKGROUND: A contralateral approach to aneurysm clipping in cases of bilateral middle cerebral artery (MCA) aneurysms reduces surgical time and cost. However, there is a lack of evidence for objective patient selection. In this study, we assessed the change in surgical freedom along the contralateral MCA to provide objective evidence for patient selection.
   METHODS: Sixteen cadaveric specimens were studied. Through a pterional approach, the surgical freedom was calculated moving distally along the contralateral MCA in 5-mm increments. In addition, in a series of 19 MCA aneurysms clipped contralaterally by the senior author, the average length of the MCA from its origin to the aneurysm neck was measured on angiography.
   RESULTS: In these patients treated via a contralateral approach, the average length of the MCA segment from its origin to the aneurysm neck was 12.4 mm. Starting at the MCA origin, surgical freedom decreased significantly between all adjacent target points except at 5-10 mm from the MCA origin.
   CONCLUSIONS: After the proximal 5 mm, there is no significant decrease in surgical maneuverability within the proximal 10 mm of MCA when approached contralaterally. When compared to the average length of the MCA from its origin to the aneurysm neck in the clinical series, it can be concluded that the first 10 mm (average, 12.4 mm) of the contralateral MCA may be considered a surgical comfort zone for a contralateral approach. This criterion may be useful for patient selection for a contralateral approach in cases of multiple bilateral intracranial aneurysms.

AB BACKGROUND: Rapid growth is a well-known property of glioblastoma (GBM); however, growth rates vary among patients. Mechanisms behind such variation have not been widely studied in human patients. We sought to investigate relationships between histopathologic features and tumor growth estimated from pretreatment magnetic resonance imaging scans.
   METHODS: In 106 patients with GBM, 2 preoperative T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scans obtained at least 14 days apart were segmented to assess tumor growth. A fitted Gompertzian growth curve based on the segmented volumes divided the tumors into 2 groups: faster and slower growth than expected based on the initial tumor volume. Histopathologic features were investigated for associations with these groups, using univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses.
   RESULTS: The presence of high cellular density and thromboses was significantly associated with radiologic growth in the multivariable analysis (P = 0.018 and 0.019, respectively), with respective odds ratios of 3.0 (95% confidence interval, 1.20-7.4) and 4.3 (95% confidence interval, 1.3-14.5) for faster growing tumors.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that high cellular density and thromboses are significant independent predictors of faster growth in human GBM. This finding underlines the importance of hypercellularity as a criterion in glioma grading. Furthermore, our findings are concordant with hypotheses suggesting hypoxia triggered by thromboses to be relevant for growth of GBM.

AB OBJECTIVE: To determine the value of a novel adult cervical deformity frailty index (CD-FI) in preoperative risk stratification.
   METHODS: We reviewed a prospective, multicenter database of adults with cervical spine deformity. We selected 40 variables to construct the CD-FI using a validated method. Patients were categorized as not frail (NF) (< 0.2), frail (0.2-0.4), or severely frail (SF) (>0.4) according to CD-FI score. We performed multivariate logistic regression to determine the relationships between CD-FI score and incidence of complications, length of hospital stay, and discharge disposition.
   RESULTS: Of 61 patients enrolled from 2009 to 2015 with at least 1 year of follow-up, the mean CD-FI score was 0.26 (range 0.25-0.59). Seventeen patients were categorized as NF, 34 as frail, and 10 as SF. The incidence of major complications increased with greater frailty, with a gamma correlation coefficient of 0.25 (asymptotic standard error, 0.22). The odds of having a major complication were greater for frail patients (odds ratio 4.4; 95% confidence interval 0.6-32) and SF patients (odds ratio 43; 95% confidence interval 2.7-684) compared with NF patients. Greater frailty was associated with a greater incidence of medical complications and had a gamma correlation coefficient of 0.30 (asymptotic standard error, 0.26). Surgical complications, discharge disposition, and length of hospital stay did not correlate significantly with frailty.
   CONCLUSIONS: Greater frailty was associated with greater risk of major complications for patients undergoing cervical spine deformity surgery. The CD-FI may be used to improve the accuracy of preoperative risk stratification and allow for adequate patient counseling.

AB OBJECTIVE: An inflammatory response occurs after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) and predicts poor outcomes. Glucocorticoids suppress inflammation and promote fluid retention. Dexamethasone is often administered after aSAH for postoperative cerebral edema and refractory headache. Our objective was to examine the impact of dexamethasone use on functional outcomes and delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) after aSAH.
   METHODS: Patients with aSAH admitted between 2010 and 2015 were included; the data source was a single-center subarachnoid hemorrhage registry. The intervention of interest was a dexamethasone taper used <7 days from ictus. The primary outcome was poor discharge functional outcome, with a modified Rankin Scale score >3. Other outcomes included DCI and infection. A propensity score for use of dexamethasone was calculated using a logistic regression model that included potential predictors of dexamethasone use and outcome. The impact of dexamethasone on outcomes of interest was calculated and the propensity score was controlled for.
   RESULTS: A total of 440 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage were admitted during the study period and 309 met eligibility criteria. Dexamethasone was administered in 101 patients (33%). A total of 127 patients (41%) had a discharge modified Rankin Scale score > 3, 105 (34%) developed DCI, and 94 (30%) developed an infection. After propensity score analysis, dexamethasone use was associated with a significant reduction in poor functional outcomes (odds ratio [OR], 0.35; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.19-0.66) but showed no significant association with DCI (OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.53-1.64) or infection (OR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.34-1.06).
   CONCLUSIONS: Dexamethasone use after aSAH was associated with a reduction in poor functional outcomes at discharge but not DCI, controlling for predictors of dexamethasone use.

AB BACKGROUND: Intracranial meningiomas are most common among patients in their fifth to seventh decade of life and rare in children and young adults. They constitute 1.5% of all neoplasms in patients age < 20 years, but account for 13.5% of all neoplasms in patients age 20-34 years. They are often associated with hereditary or familial syndromes in children and young adults, and tend to be of high grade. Here we describe the histopathological subtypes of intracranial meningioma between human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1)-seropositive patients and the general population with intracranial meningiomas 35 years old and younger.
   METHODS: Data were collected from all consecutive patients age <= 35 years diagnosed with intracranial meningioma between May 2003 and May 2015. Age was categorized as < 20 years, 21-30 years, and >30 years. Histopathological grade was classified according to the 2000 World Health Organization (WHO) grading system as grade I, II, or III. Patients were grouped into an HIV-1e seropositive group and the general population, presumed seronegative. WHO grade II/III meningioma represented high-grade meningioma.
   RESULTS: HIV-1eseropositive status was associated with increased risk of the development of high-grade (WHO grade II/III) meningioma (odds ratio, 2.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-8.09; P = 0.04) compared with the general population of patients with meningiomas. No significant associations were found between WHO grade and age, sex, ethnicity/race, or location.
   CONCLUSIONS: Intracranial meningiomas in young HIV1e-positive patients tend to be of high grade; therefore, conservative or noninvasive therapies should be offered with caution and only after tissue diagnosis has confirmed benign WHO grade.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate clinical parameters of anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) treatment and outcomes using osseous allografts in different age groups, study the postoperative results of restoration of lordosis, and evaluate the utility of bone allografts for ACDF, including graft subsidence.
   METHODS: We reviewed data from 154 patients with clinical symptoms and radiologic signs of disc herniation and/or cervical spondylosis. Decompression was achieved through discectomy, osteophyte ablation, endplate drilling, and foraminotomy. Fusion was achieved with allografts, demineralized bone matrix, and cervical plates/screws. The relationships between preoperative and postoperative cervical spine configuration (ie, Benzel's criteria), pain intensity, and neurologic status were analyzed.
   RESULTS: The mean patient age was 51 years, and the median duration of symptoms was 6 months. The mean age differed significantly between the patients with diabetes and those without diabetes. The mean body mass index (BMI) was 30.36. Fifty-two patients had disc herniation, and 102 had spondylosis. Surgery was performed on a total of 313 levels. The median duration of follow-up was 24 months. Marked improvements in postoperative spine configuration or preservation of lordosis were recorded. Overall, 122 patients were neurologically intact, and 32 patients experienced residual postsurgery neurologic deficits (minor, n = 22; moderate, n = 9; severe, n = 1). Postoperative pain intensity and neurologic status were significantly improved. Outcomes were excellent in 66 patients, good in 61, fair in 24, and poor in 3 (no mortality). No significant differences in patient age, smoking habits, diabetes, or BMI were seen among outcomes, or between patients with soft disc herniation or spondylosis.
   CONCLUSIONS: Osseous allografting can excellently restore cervical lordosis regardless of age and is an excellent graft choice for ACDF. Patients of advanced age with comorbidities should not be denied surgery.

AB OBJECTIVE: Commercially available fibrin glue (ComFG), which is used commonly worldwide, is produced with pooled human plasma from multiple donors. However, it has added bovine aprotinin, which involves the risk of infection, allogenic immunity, and allergic reactions. We evaluate the efficacy, reliability, and safety of completely autologous fibrin glue (CAFG).
   METHODS: From August 2014 to February 2016, prospective data were collected and analyzed from 153 patients. CAFG was prepared with the CryoSeal System using autologous blood and was applied during neurosurgical procedures. Using CAFG-soaked oxidized regenerated cellulose and/or polyglycolic acid sheets, we performed a pinpoint hemostasis, transposed the offending vessels in a microvascular decompression, and covered the dural incision to prevent cerebrospinal fluid leakage.
   RESULTS: The CryoSeal System had generated up to a mean of 4.51 mL (range, 3.0-8.4 mL) of CAFG from 400 mL autologous blood. Com-FG products were not used in our procedures. Only 6 patients required an additional allogeneic blood transfusion. The hemostatic effective rate was 96.1% (147 of 153 patients). Only 1 patient who received transsphenoidal surgery for a pituitary adenoma presented with the complication of delayed postoperative cerebrospinal fluid leakage (0.65%). No patient developed allergic reactions or systemic complications associated with the use of CAFG.
   CONCLUSIONS: CAFG effectively provides hemostatic, adhesive, and safety performance. The timing and three-dimensional shape of CAFG-soaked oxidized regenerated cellulose and/or polyglycolic acid sheets solidification can be controlled with slow fibrin formation. The cost to prepare CAFG is similar compared with Com-FG products, and it can therefore be easily used at most institutions.

AB OBJECTIVE: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is an aggressive primary brain tumor with dismal survival. This study aims to examine the prognostic value of primary tumor sites and race on survival outcomes.
   METHODS: Patient data obtained from the Scott and White Hospital Brain Tumor Registry (1976-2013) were stratified according to sex, age, race, primary tumor site, vital status, and survival.
   RESULTS: Of the 645 patients, 580 (89.9%) were diagnosed with GBM not otherwise specified (GBM NOS), 57 (8.8%) with GBM, and 8 (1.2%) with giant-cell GBM. Most were male (53.5%), aged 50 years or older (78.7%). The white population had the highest GBM prevalence (87.1%) and the lowest overall survival versus all other race groups (6.6% vs. 30.1%; P < 0.01). The black population had a relatively low prevalence of GBM (5.9%) and the greatest overall survival versus all others (47.4% vs. 7.3%; P < 0.01). Primary tumor sites located in the temporal (25.8% vs. 20.2%; P=0.03), occipital (8.1% vs. 2.9%; P=0.05), and parietal lobes (24.2% vs. 20.8%; P=0.05) had a greater occurrence in surviving individuals. The overall survival for men versus women was (62.9% vs. 37.1%; P=0.12).
   CONCLUSIONS: Black racial background and temporal, occipital, or parietal primary tumor sites are suggestive of positive survival outcomes. Conversely, white racial background with primary tumor sites in the brain overlapping and NOS areas seem to be associated with negative outcomes and decreased survival. Thus, racial background and primary tumor site may be useful prognostic factors in patients with GBM.

ID STIMULATION; LANGUAGE; BRAIN; PROPOSAL; GLIOMAS
AB BACKGROUND: Intraoperative functional cortical mapping using direct electrical stimulation may show a wider individual variability than suggested by noninvasive imaging data of healthy subjects.
   METHODS: We assessed intraoperative variability of the frontal eye fields and the speech arrest sites in adult patients who underwent awake craniotomy with direct electrostimulation for treatment of diffuse gliomas located within eloquent regions, and we compared findings with human cortical parcellation of the Human Connectome Project.
   RESULTS: The frontal eye fields were defined by intraoperative direct electrostimulations (14.3% of patients) projected on the superior subdivision of the premotor cortex covering the areas defined as frontal eye fields (parcel index 10), area 55b (parcel index 12), and premotor eye field (parcel index 11) and in the posterior part of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex covering the areas defined as inferior 6-8 transitional area (parcel index 97), area 8Av (parcel index 67), and area 8C (parcel index 73). The speech arrest sites were defined by intraoperative direct electrostimulations (100% of patients) projected predominantly posteriorly to the inferior frontal gyrus in the inferior subdivision of the premotor cortex, that is, rostral area 6 (parcel index 78), ventral area 6 (parcel index 54), and area 43 (parcel index 99).
   CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative functional cortical mapping using direct electrostimulation highlights that actual individual variability is wider than suggested by analyses of healthy subjects and results in atypical patterns of functional organization and structural and functional changes of the human cerebral cortex under pathologic conditions.

AB OBJECTIVE: The placement of a ventricular catheter for temporary cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversion is associated with a considerable risk of CSF infection. The authors investigated the effect of a CSF leak on CSF-related infection and the predisposing factors for a CSF leak.
   METHODS: Fifty-two patients who underwent external ventricular drainage (EVD) for acute hydrocephalus associated with a subarachnoid hemorrhage or intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) were enrolled in this prospective study. A CSF leakedetection paper (small sterilized filter paper) was applied at the percutaneous catheter exit site to check for any bloody CSF leak. In addition, radiologic and clinical data were collected.
   RESULTS: Four of the 52 patients (7.7%) developed an EVD-related CSF infection from organisms including Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 3) and Staphylococcus hominis (n = 1). A prolonged CSF leak > 1 day was detected in 9 patients (17.3%) and revealed as a significant risk factor for CSF infection with a 44.4% positive predictive value. Moreover, an IVH > 10 mL was found in 11 patients (21.2%) and revealed as a significant predisposing factor for a CSF leak at the percutaneous catheter exit.
   CONCLUSIONS: A prolonged CSF leak for > 1 day at the percutaneous catheter exit site is a crucial risk factor for EVD-related CSF infection and an IVH > 10 mL is a predisposing factor for a CSF leak.

AB BACKGROUND: The clinical decision whether and when to resume antithrombotics in patients with chronic subdural hematomas (CSDH) postoperatively is limited by a lack of quality evidence exploring this topic. Our study aims to assess the available evidence of patient complication outcomes, specifically hemorrhagic and thromboembolic events, following the resumption or non-resumption of antithrombotic agents postoperatively in CSDH patients already on these agents before CSDH.
   METHODS: We followed recommended PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews. Electronic database searches were performed to identify included studies. Data were extracted and analyzed using meta-analysis.
   RESULTS: Eight studies were included for analysis. The most common indication for antithrombotic treatment before onset of CSDH was atrial fibrillation (29.6%), followed by prosthetic heart valve (16.6%), recent myocardial infarction (14.1%), prior stroke or transient ischemic attack (11.6%), and finally venous thromboembolism (8.3%). The overall hemorrhagic complication rate was 14.8% in the resumption group versus 18.6% in the no resumption group (P = 0.591). This did not differ between early (< 2 weeks) versus late (> 1 month) resumption (15% vs. 18.6%, P = 0.97). The rate of thromboembolism however was statistically lower in those who resumed antithrombotics (2.9% vs. 6.8%, P< 0.001). There was a non-significant trend towards higher thromboembolic rates with early resumption (5.3% vs. 2.1%, P = 0.23).
   CONCLUSIONS: The decision to resume antithrombotics postoperatively in the clinical management of CSDH patients is a complex one and should therefore be a highly individualized process. Our meta-analysis demonstrates that in selected cases, it is feasible to resume early antithrombotic treatment without additional hemorrhagic or thromboembolic risk.

AB OBJECTIVE: History of previous cervical spine surgery is a frequently cited cause of worse outcomes after cervical spine surgery. The purpose of this study was to determine any differences in clinical outcomes after cervical spine surgery between patients with and without a history of previous cervical spine surgery.
   METHODS: A multicenter prospective database was reviewed retrospectively to identify patients with cervical spondylosis undergoing surgery with a minimum 2-year follow-up. Patients were divided into 2 groups: patients with (W) or without (WO) previous history of cervical spine surgery. Statistical analyses of Health-Related Quality of Life scores were analyzed with statistical software to fit linear mixed models for continuous longitudinal outcome.
   RESULTS: A total of 1286 patients (377 W, 909 WO) met criteria for inclusion. Overall, patients in both groups experienced an improvement in their Health-Related Quality of Life scores. However, patients in the W group had significantly decreased improvement compared with WO patients in the Neck Disability Index score and the following SF-36 domain scores: Role Physical, Bodily Pain, General Health, Vitality, Social Functioning, Health Transition, and Physical Component Summary at all time points (P < 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference between the W and WO groups in operative time, estimated blood loss, length of stay, or complications (P > 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a history of previous cervical spine surgery had inferior improvement in quality of life outcome scores. Patients with a history of previous surgical intervention who elect to undergo subsequent surgeries should be appropriately counseled about expected results.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate effect of July admission on short-term outcome after endovascular coiling of patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) owing to ruptured aneurysms.
   METHODS: Data from the National Inpatient Sample (2012-2014) were gathered. Adult patients with SAH who underwent endovascular therapy at a teaching hospital were identified. Admissions during July were compared with other months as well as based on admission quarter (AQ): AQ1 (July to September), AQ2 (October to December), AQ3 (January to March), and AQ4 (April to June). Outcome measures included inpatient morbidity (death, iatrogenic stroke, or myocardial infarction), inpatient mortality, and nonroutine discharges.
   RESULTS: The National Inpatient Sample database yielded 8515 patients with a diagnosis of SAH who underwent endovascular coiling between 2012 and 2014. Among these, 665 (7.8%) were admitted in July, and 7850 (92.2%) were admitted in other months. Overall, there were no differences in any of the examined outcomes, including morbidity (15.0% vs. 17.3%, P = 0.513), mortality (10.5% vs. 11.8%, P = 0.665), or nonroutine discharge (57.1% vs. 59.7%, P = 0.567), for patients admitted in July versus other months. Based on AQ, 24.5% of patients were admitted in AQ1, 26.0% in AQ2, 23.8% in AQ3, and 25.7% in AQ4. Similar to July versus other month admissions, there were no significant differences in outcomes based on AQ.
   CONCLUSIONS: Based on findings of this national investigation, patients with SAH owing to ruptured aneurysms who undergo endovascular therapy during the beginning of the academic year in July may not have worse short-term outcome compared with patients with admissions during other months.

ID CLINICAL ARTICLE; SYLVIAN FISSURE; MR-ANGIOGRAPHY; RESECTION; SURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: Three-dimensional (3D) time of flight (TOF) imaging is the current gold standard for noninvasive, preoperative localization of lenticulostriate arteries (LSAs) in insular gliomas; however, the utility of this modality depends on tumor intensity.
   METHODS: Over a 3-year period, 48 consecutive patients with insular gliomas were prospectively evaluated. Location of LSAs and their relationship with the tumor were determined using a combination of contrast-enhanced coronal 3D TOF magnetic resonance angiography and coronal 3D constructive interference in steady state (CISS) sequences. These findings were analyzed with respect to extent of tumor resection and early postoperative motor outcome.
   RESULTS: Tumor was clearly visualized in 29 (60.4%) patients with T1-hypointense tumors using 3D TOF and in all patients using CISS sequences. Using combined 3D TOF and CISS, LSA-tumor interface was well seen in 47 patients, including all patients with T1-heterointense or T1-isointense tumors. Extent of resection was higher in the LSA-pushed group compared with the LSA-encased group. In the LSA-encased group, 6 (12.5%) patients developed postoperative hemiparesis; 2 (4.2%) cases were attributed to LSA injury.
   CONCLUSIONS: Contrast-enhanced 3D TOF can delineate LSAs in almost all insular gliomas but is limited in identifying the LSA-tumor interface. This limitation can be overcome by addition of analogous CISS sequences that delineate the LSA-tumor interface regardless of tumor intensity. Combined 3D TOF and 3D CISS is a useful tool for surgical planning and safer resections of insular tumors and may have added surgical relevance when included as an intraoperative adjunct.

AB OBJECTIVE: Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) is one important cause of drug-resistant epilepsy potentially curable by epilepsy surgery. We investigated the options of using neuro-navigation and intraoperative magnetic-resonance tomographical imaging (MRI) to avoid residual epileptogenic tissue during resection of patients with FCD II to improve seizure outcome.
   METHODS: Altogether, 24 patients with FCD II diagnosed by MRI (16 female, 8 male; mean age 34 +/- 10 years) suffered from drug-resistant electroclinical and focal epilepsy for a mean of 20.7 +/- 5 years. Surgery was performed with preoperative stereoelectroencephalography (in 15 patients), neuronavigation, and intraoperative 1.5T-iopMRI in all 24 investigated patients.
   RESULTS: In 75% of patients (18/24), a complete resection was performed. In 89% (16/18) of completely resected patients, we documented an Engel I seizure outcome after a mean follow-up of 42 months. All incompletely resected patients had a worse outcome (Engel II-III, P < 0.0002). Patients with FCD IIB had also significant better seizure outcome compared with patients diagnosed as having FCD IIA (82% vs. 28%, P < 0.02). In 46% (11/24) of patients, intraoperative second-look surgeries due to residual lesions detected during the intraoperative MRI were performed. In these 11 patients, there were significant more completely seizure free patients (73% vs. 38% Engel IA), compared with 13 patients who finished surgery after the first intraoperative MRI (P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: Excellent seizure outcome after surgery of patients with FCD II positively correlated with the amount of resection, histologic subtype, and the use of intraoperative MRI, especially when intraoperative second-look surgeries were performed.

   Training Course
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY

   radiosurgery
AB OBJECTIVE: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) represents an expanding approach for neurosurgeons and radiation oncologists. We evaluate educational gaps of senior residents drawn from each specialty as part of a focused SRS course. We also evaluate the strengths and limitations of SRS training in current residency programs of the course residents and faculty.
   METHODS: The American Association of Neurological Surgeons and American Society of Radiation Oncology jointly held a senior resident course in SRS. Residents were nominated by program directors from across the United States. Thirty residents were chosen to participate in the course. The residents were surveyed before and after the course. Faculty (n = 14) were also surveyed to ascertain their perspectives on current training in SRS.
   RESULTS: Most (96.7%) of the residents planned to perform SRS when finished, and 94% anticipated SRS indications to expand. Regarding SRS technique, 47% reported average/above average understanding of intracranial SRS; only 17% expressed similar understanding of spinal SRS. Before the course, 76.6% noted below average/average ability to recognize and manage SRS complications. Twenty-three percent of the faculty indicated that graduating residents from their programs were unprepared to perform radiosurgery. Residents' self-assessed understanding of brain SRS indication (P = 0.000693), SRS techniques (P = 0.000021), spinal SRS indications (P = 0.000050), spinal SRS techniques (P = 0.000019), and complication recognition and management (P = 0.00033) significantly improved following the course.
   CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge and training gaps in SRS appear evident to the senior residents and faculty of both specialties. We believe that other educational opportunities for SRS experience are necessary to optimize clinical competency, as well as meet future clinical staffing needs for this expanding, multidisciplinary approach. Further evaluation of gaps in SRS is necessary through a larger, nationwide survey of U.S. neurosurgeons, program directors, and residents.

AB BACKGROUND: Surgical treatment of patients with atlantoaxial instability caused by pathologic changes of the skull base and craniovertebral junction combined with anterior compression of the brain stem is still associated with substantial technical difficulties and remains a matter of debate. Currently, anterior stabilization of the atlantoaxial junction is a promising approach that allows for the resection of the pathologic lesion of the skull base and craniovertebral junction with subsequent stabilization of C1-C2 or C1-C3 in 1 stage.
   METHODS: In this article, we present 5 clinical cases in which transoral decompression and anterior stabilization of the C1-C2 (4 cases) and C1-C3 (1 case of anteroposterior stabilization) segments with custom-made fixation systems was used to treat various pathologic conditions of the craniovertebral junction.
   RESULTS: In all cases, complete removal of the pathologic lesion and decompression of the upper cervical spinal cord as well as reliable stabilization of the upper spinal segments were achieved. Some degree of movement in the cervical spine was preserved in all patients due to unfixed C0-C1 and C3-C7 segments in 4 cases and C0-C1 and C4-C7 in 1 case. Implant migration or instability was not observed in any of the cases. The follow-up period was from 1 to 4 years after surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: The first experience of anterior fixation using individually manufactured C1-C2 and C1-C3 systems demonstrated their effectiveness. This approach can be safely used as an alternative or in combination with standard posterior stabilization methods. An innovative surgical technology developed and implemented in our surgical practice allows for optimization of the surgical technique, reduces the number of perioperative complications, eliminates movement restrictions in the cervical spine, improves motor activity, and makes earlier patient rehabilitation possible.

AB BACKGROUND: The incidence of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) continues to increase, and the spine is the most common site for bony metastasis. Radiation therapy is one treatment for spinal RCC metastasis. Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is a newer treatment that reportedly has benefits over conventional external beam radiotherapy. This study systematically reviewed the current literature on SBRT for metastatic RCC to spine.
   METHODS: A search of PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases was conducted in accordance with PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Clinical articles evaluating SBRT for RCC metastases were identified. After inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied, the search resulted in 9 articles. Data including pain outcomes, local control, survival outcomes, vertebral compression fracture (VCF), and toxicity were extracted and evaluated.
   RESULTS: The studies analyzed showed an improvement in pain in 41%-95% of patients. Local control rates after SBRT ranged 71.2%-85.7% at 1 year, a significant improvement when compared with conventional external beam radiotherapy. The rate of VCF after treatment with SBRT ranged 16%-27.5%, with single-fraction therapy being a risk factor for increased incidence. Overall toxicity rates ranged 23%-38.5%, with only 3 cases of grade 3 toxicity (nausea) and no cases of radiation myelitis.
   CONCLUSIONS: Use of SBRT for spinal metastasis from RCC resulted in significant local control and pain outcomes. There is a risk of VCF with SBRT; however, treatment seems to be well tolerated with few serious side effects. There is continued need for long-term prospective studies investigating the optimal role of SBRT in the treatment algorithm of RCC spinal metastases.

AB BACKGROUND: The incidence of meningioma has increased drastically recently, particularly in older adults. Surgical intervention has the potential to reduce neurologic symptoms and achieve favorable, long-term outcomes. There is considerable variability in the literature examining the relationship between age and outcomes after meningioma surgery. The objective of this study was to identify the relationship between age and postoperative complications after craniotomy for resection of meningioma.
   METHODS: The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database was used to identify patients undergoing craniotomy for meningioma resection between 2005 and 2012. Multivariate analysis was used to identify associations between age and postoperative complications.
   RESULTS: Age > 80 years is an independent risk factor for any complication (odds ratio [OR], 2.374; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-4.4; P [0.015), death within 30 days of surgery (OR, 15.7; 95% CI, 3.0-81.0; P < 0.001), and length of stay > 5 days (OR, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.8-5.6; P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: Advanced age, particularly > 80 years, is an independent predictor of morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing craniotomy for resection of meningioma. As such, it should be considered in preoperative optimization and risk stratification.

TI Low-Pressure Hydrocephalus: A Case Report and Review of the Literature

LA English
DT Review
DE Endoscopic third ventriculostomy; Hydrocephalus; Low-pressure
   hydrocephalus; Magnetic resonance elastography
ID DRAINAGE; BRAIN
AB BACKGROUND: The entity of low-pressure hydrocephalus remains poorly understood and thoroughly debated. Symptomatic improvement accompanied by decrease in ventricular size after prolonged subatmospheric drainage has been well documented, and this method has been considered the criterion standard of management. Few studies have examined alternative treatment options, either to avoid the risks associated with prolonged external ventricular drainage or because of the failure of traditional methods.
   OBJECTIVES: This study compiled and examined reported cases of low-pressure hydrocephalus in an attempt to provide an up-to-date summary of the condition.
   METHODS: A literature search was conducted by use of Ovid Medline and PubMed filtered for the past 25 years with specific key terms, inclusion criteria, and exclusion criteria. Selected case studies and case series were then compared, and statistical analysis was performed where appropriate.
   RESULTS: Over 25 years, 17 articles met our criteria. In addition to our case, 90 cases of LPH were reported. Magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) has proved to be an effective means of studying the viscoelastic properties of the brain. Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) appears to be a strong alternative, or additional, treatment.
   CONCLUSION: MRE may prove to be effective in studying LPH because of its ability to quantify viscoelastic properties in response to therapy. Additionally, ETV should be considered in cases of LPH, although there is little evidence in the current literature to support its use. There are suggestions that it may lead to fewer shunt-dependent patients. Future studies are needed because there are few documented examples.

   COMPLICATIONS; THALAMOTOMY
AB BACKGROUND: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) indications include movement disorders, psychiatric affections, or epilepsy in which patients risk social isolation heightened by abnormal motions or behavioral patterns. Further stigmatization after DBS surgery from head shaving, visible scarring, or disfigurement from bulky lead insertion points should be avoided.
   OBJECTIVE: We present a cosmetically optimized, adapted submammarian approach for DBS neurostimulator implantation that leaves the decolletage untouched.
   METHODS: Over 24 months, 61 patients suffering from Parkinson disease, dystonia, or tremor underwent DBS surgery. The modified, submammarian approach was compared with the conventional infraclavicular approach regarding clinical outcome, complications, and limitations over a 5-year follow-up.
   RESULTS: Neurostimulators were implanted in a paraumbilical (n = 20) or infraclavicular position (n = 41; Parkinson disease, n = 27; dystonia, n = 9; tremor, n = 5), the latter using a standard (n = 16), modified juxta-axillary (n = 6), or submammarian approach (n = 19; 18 women, 1 man with significant gynecomastia). After 12 months, there was no significant difference in the infection rate and one event of rebleeding in each group. Overall, operation time was longer (+20 minutes) for the submammarian versus standard, infraclavicular approach, but acceptable. Neurostimulator replacement was, necessary within 5 years due to advanced battery discharge (n = 32). Battery replacement was easily achieved using the submammarian approach (n = 14), again with increased surgical time (+20 minutes), and iatrogenic damage to extensions was avoidable.
   CONCLUSIONS: A submammarian approach might be an alternative for infraclavicular implantation of DBS neurostimulators, particularly in female patients in the context of cosmetically optimized surgery. Patients' self-perception and self-esteem may be strengthened, potentially enabling them to better cope with disease.

AB BACKGROUND: Lumbar puncture (LP) is an essential part of adult neurology residency training. Technologic as well as nontechnologic training is needed. However, current assessment tools mostly focus on the technologic aspects of LP. We propose a training method-problem- and simulator-based learning (PSBL)-in LP residency training to develop overall skills of neurology residents.
   METHODS: We enrolled 60 neurology postgraduate-year-1 residents from our standardized residents training center and randomly divided them into 2 groups: traditional teaching group and PSBL group. After training, we assessed the extent that the residents were ready to perform LP and tracked successful LPs performed by the residents. We then asked residents to complete questionnaires about the training models. Performance scores and the results of questionnaires were compared between the 2 groups.
   RESULTS: Students and faculty concluded that PSBL provided a more effective learning experience than the traditional teaching model. Although no statistical difference was found in the pretest, posttest, and improvement rate scores between the 2 groups, based on questionnaire scores and number of successful LPs after training, the PSBL group showed a statistically significant improvement compared with the traditional group. Findings indicated that nontechnical elements, such as planning before the procedure and controlling uncertainties during the procedure, are more crucial than technical elements.
   CONCLUSIONS: Compared with traditional teaching model, PSBL for LP training can develop overall surgical skills, including technical and nontechnical elements, improving performance. Residents in the PSBL group were more confident and effective in performing LP.

AB OBJECTIVE: To research the early acute response events of facial nerve injury.
   METHODS: Sixty male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 2 groups. Facial nerve anastomosis was performed for rats in study group. Rats in control group underwent the same surgical procedure, but without cutting off the facial nerve. Before nerve anastomosis and at days 1, 3, 7, 14, and 28 after nerve anastomosis, 5 rats of each group were selected and right side brainstem tissue samples containing the facial nerve nucleus were obtained. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and TUNEL detection was performed to observe facial neurons changes. Facial neurons mortality and apoptosis were studied. Expression of caspase-3, LC3, and Beclin1 was detected with Western blot assay.
   RESULTS: In study group on day 7 day after nerve anastomosis, Nissl body dissolution and apoptotic facial neurons were significantly increased, the typical polygonal shape and swollen cells disappeared, the number of facial neurons was significantly lower, and the number of apoptotic facial neurons was significantly higher (P < 0.01). In addition, facial neuron mortality rate was significantly increased at day 7, reaching the peak at day 14. Expression of caspase-3, LC3, and Beclin1 was also significantly up-regulated after nerve anastomosis.
   CONCLUSION: Nissl body dissolution, typical polygonal shape disappearing, cell swelling, facial neuron mortality and apoptosis, and up-regulated expression of caspase-3, LC3, and Beclin1 are the early events of cell death after facial nerve injury, which are the important precursors to facial nerve injury.

AB BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the potential role of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) protein expression in predicting the modality of treatment failure in glioblastoma (GB).
   METHODS: Patients with unifocal GB undergoing surgery and postoperative radiochemotherapy from February 2008 to July 2015 were included into the study. The EGFR protein expression level was assessed by immunohistochemistry in GB tissues and classified into high and low expression. Time to progression (TTP) and pattern of recurrence (PR) were evaluated. PRs were classified as central, in-field, marginal, or distant recurrences.
   RESULTS: After a median follow-up time of 13 months (range, 6-67 months), 102 patients (79.1%) showed recurrences that were detectable on magnetic resonance imaging. Median TTP was 9 months after the completion of radiochemotherapy. EGFR expression was significantly correlated with TTP (log-rank test, P = 0.003) and PR (Fisher exact test, P = 0.01). The low-EGFR group had a median TTP of 13 months and a prevalence of central/infield recurrences (accounting to a total 81%). The high-EGFR group had a shorter median TTP (6 months) and a higher rate of marginal/distant recurrences (55.6%).
   CONCLUSIONS: Different modality of recurrence related to EGFR expression in patients with GB envisages implication for target contouring of radiotherapy volumes and other therapeutic strategies.

TI Anatomic Basis for Minimally Invasive Resection of Intradural

AB OBJECTIVE: Since the first resections of intradural extramedullary neoplasms, neurosurgeons have tended to preserve as much of the integrity of the spine as possible while ensuring a safe corridor to resect these lesions. A dimensional analysis of intradural lesions superimposed on a dimensional analysis of the thoracic canal would provide the anatomic basis for a minimal access approach. The authors report the results of such an analysis on a series of patients with intradural extramedullary lesions.
   METHODS: A retrospective analysis was undertaken of 26 thoracic intradural extramedullary lesions managed with open or minimally invasive resection. The size of each lesion was measured in the rostrocaudal, lateral, and anteroposterior dimensions and then averaged and compared with reported dimensions of the thoracic spinal canal.
   RESULTS: The mean (range) dimensions of the surgically resected thoracic lesions were 18.6 mm (10-25 mm) for rostrocaudal, 13.0 mm (7-18 mm) for lateral, and 13.6 mm (9-17 mm) for anteroposterior. No patient had any evidence of thoracic canal remodeling.
   CONCLUSIONS: Thoracic intradural extramedullary lesions become symptomatic as they approach the limits of the thoracic canal, resulting in an inherent dimensional limitation in the rostrocaudal, lateral, and anteroposterior dimensions. Displacement of the spinal cord by the lesion to one side further favors a minimally invasive unilateral approach. A paraspinal unilateral hemilaminectomy approach with a 35 x 20 mm exposure centered over the lesion offers a safe surgical corridor for resection while preserving the posterior tension band, facet complexes, and paraspinal musculature.

AB BACKGROUND: Surgery for symptomatic spinal meta-stases is effective at prolonging ambulation and life, but it can appear costly at first glance. We have studied the difference between the cost of surgery and reimbursement received, and the cost-effectiveness of surgery in a U.K. tertiary referral spinal center.
   METHODS: A cost-versus-reimbursement and cost-utility analysis was performed in a prospective cohort of patients admitted for surgical treatment of spinal meta-stases. Outcome measures were health-related quality of life using the EuroQol EQ-5D-3L, Frankel score, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and treatment and reimbursement costs.
   RESULTS: One hundred thirty consecutive patients were prospectively recruited, of whom 92 had information available for cost and reimbursement comparison, and 100 had information to complete costeutility analysis. Median cost of hospital treatment per patient was 20,752; pound median reimbursement received was 18,291 pound, with a median shortfall of 1,967 pound. Surgery in addition to radiotherapy over a lifetime horizon was both more effective and less costly than radiotherapy alone, and therefore was found to be cost-effective.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that reimbursement to hospitals for surgical management of symptomatic spinal metastases in the United Kingdom is broadly in line with costs, and that there was an overall saving as a result of community care costs being mitigated by patients walking for longer, which is within the expected National Health Service threshold. Surgery for metastatic spinal tumors is effective and a good value for the money.

AB OBJECTIVE: Arachnoid webs are rare intradural lesions that can cause direct spinal cord compression or alteration of the cerebrospinal fluid flow with syringomyelia. Surgery has been historically performed through wide-open laminectomies. The aim of this study is to prove the feasibility of minimally invasive techniques for the excision of arachnoid webs.
   METHODS: A retrospective review of two cases of minimally invasive excision of thoracic arachnoid webs was performed. Surgery was undertaken through expandable tubular retractors.
   RESULTS: Complete excision was achieved through the described approach, with minimal bony removal and soft tissue disruption. There were no intraoperative or perioperative complications. Both patients were mobilized early and discharged home within 24 hours after surgery. Postoperative imaging showed good re-expansion of the spinal cord, with no evidence of residual compression or tethering.
   CONCLUSIONS: For symptomatic arachnoid webs, surgery remains the only definitive treatment. In expert hands, the excision of arachnoid webs can be achieved with tubular retractors and minimally invasive techniques.

   OUTCOMES; FRACTURES
AB OBJECTIVE: Posterior-anterior spondylodesis is often used to stabilize the spine in various pathologies. The anterior procedure is often performed via thoracoscopy. It is unclear whether the anterior procedure should be performed immediately after posterior instrumentation or after the patient has convalesced. This retrospective study compared perioperative safety and morbidity in 1-stage versus 2-stage posterior-anterior fusion surgery with a thoracoscopic anterior approach.
   METHODS: All consecutive patients who underwent surgery for posterior-anterior spinal stabilization from 2006 to 2013 were included. American Society of Anesthesiologists score, preoperative and postoperative laboratory values, operation duration, blood loss, intensive care unit stay, pain, postoperative hospital stay, perioperative complications, and preoperative and postoperative Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group and Frankel scores were assessed. A subset of the cohort was selected by propensity score matching to eliminate possible selection bias.
   RESULTS: There were 247 patients who underwent 1-stage (n = 104) or 2-stage (n = 143) stabilization with thoracoscopic fusion. Spinal pathologies were fracture, malignancy, pyogenic spondylodiscitis, degenerative spinal disorders, and failed previous surgery. One-stage and 2-stage procedures were similar in terms of preoperative, surgical, and postoperative variables, including complication rates, except that the 1-stage procedure was associated with greater pain 2 days after surgery and shorter hospital stay. The propensity scoreematched cohort of 64 pairs yielded similar results with only 1-stage patients showing elevated visual analog scale score on postoperative day 2 (3.8 vs. 2.4, P = 0.043).
   CONCLUSIONS: One-stage stabilization was as safe as 2-stage stabilization and associated with shorter hospitalization. Greater pain after the 1-stage procedure, which resolved 30 days after surgery, reflects the fact that 2-stage patients already had pain relief when they underwent thoracoscopy.

AB BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Multilevel spondylolysis is a rare cause of progressive lower back pain, and patients who fail conservative management are treated surgically. Direct repair methods can maintain mobility and lead to decreased morbidity compared with spinal fusion in sing-lelevel spondylolysis. In this paper, we present a patient with nonadjacent multilevel spondylolysis who underwent the "smiley face" technique of direct multilevel repair without fusion using 3-dimensional intraoperative spinal navigation.
   METHODS: Bilateral spondylolysis at L3 and L5 with associated spondylolisthesis in a 50-year-old male was repaired using the "smiley face" technique. Patient-reported outcomes, including the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and visual analog scale scores for back and leg pain, were assessed preoperatively along with 6 weeks and 4 months postoperatively.
   RESULTS: Postoperative computed tomography imaging showed precise screw insertion and rod placement along with stable hardware alignment in follow-up imaging. The patient's ODI and lower back visual analog scale scores decreased from 25 to 8 and 7.5 to 4, respectively, correlating to an excellent outcome on ODI.
   CONCLUSION: Direct repair and avoidance of fusion is possible and can provide good functional outcomes in patients with nonadjacent multilevel spondylolysis and associated spondylolisthesis.

AB BACKGROUND: Novel audiovisual feedback methods were developed to improve image guidance during skull base surgery by providing audiovisual warnings when the drill tip enters a protective perimeter set at a distance around anatomic structures ("distance control") and visualizing bone drilling ("virtual drilling").
   OBJECTIVE: To benchmark the drill damage risk reduction provided by distance control, to quantify the accuracy of virtual drilling, and to investigate whether the proposed feedback methods are clinically feasible.
   METHODS: In a simulated surgical scenario using human cadavers, 12 unexperienced users (medical students) drilled 12 mastoidectomies. Users were divided into a control group using standard image guidance and 3 groups using distance control with protective perimeters of 1, 2, or 3 mm. Damage to critical structures (sigmoid sinus, semicircular canals, facial nerve) was assessed. Neurosurgeons performed another 6 mastoidectomy/translabyrinthine and retro-labyrinthine approaches. Virtual errors as compared with real postoperative drill cavities were calculated. In a clinical setting, 3 patients received lateral skull base surgery with the proposed feedback methods.
   RESULTS: Users drilling with distance control protective perimeters of 3 mm did not damage structures, whereas the groups using smaller protective perimeters and the control group injured structures. Virtual drilling maximum cavity underestimations and overestimations were 2.8 +/- 0.1 and 3.3 +/- 0.4 mm, respectively. Feedback methods functioned properly in the clinical setting.
   CONCLUSION: Distance control reduced the risks of drill damage proportional to the protective perimeter distance. Errors in virtual drilling reflect spatial errors of the image guidance system. These feedback methods are clinically feasible.

AB INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to explore the predisposing factors for fracture nonunion after a lateral screw was combined with C2 pedicle/laminar screw for a type II odontoid fracture and hopefully provide references in decision making and surgical planning for spinal surgeons.
   METHODS: This is a retrospective study. By retrieving the medical records from January 2010 to July 2015 in our hospital, 117 type II odontoid fracture patients were reviewed. According to the occurrence of fracture union at the final follow-up, patients were divided into 2 groups: union and nonunion. To investigate the predisposing factors for fracture nonunion, 3 categorized factors were analyzed statistically: patient characteristics-age, sex, body mass index, preoperative Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) scores, duration, comorbidity, and complicated injuries; surgical variables-surgery time, blood loss, C2 fixation manner, vertebral artery injury, bone source for fusion between the posterior arch of C1 and the laminae and spinous process of C2; radiographic parameters-preoperative and immediate postoperative data of C0-2 curvature, C2-7 curvature, C2-7 sagittal vertical axis, C7 slope, fracture classification, congenital hypoplastic vertebral artery, and the separation and displacement of the odontoid fracture. Other variables including JOA and visual analog scale scores for neck pain, neck stiffness, and patient satisfaction at final follow-up were recorded and compared between the 2 groups.
   RESULTS: Postoperative fracture nonunion was detected in 76 of 117 patients (65%) at final follow-up. There was no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups in patient characteristics of sex, body mass index, JOA score, comorbidity, and complicated injuries. The mean age at operation was younger in the union group than in the nonunion group, and the mean duration was shorter in the union group than in the nonunion group. There was no difference in surgical variables of surgery time, blood loss, C2 fixation manner, vertebral artery injury, bone source for fusion between the posterior arch of C1 and the laminae and spinous process of C2. There was no difference in radiographic parameters of fracture classification, congenital hypoplastic vertebral artery, preoperative and immediate postoperative C0-2 curvature, C2-7 curvature, C2-7 SVA, and C7 slope. No difference was found in preoperative and immediate postoperative displacement of the odontoid fracture or immediate postoperative separation of the odontoid fracture, while the preoperative separation of the odontoid fracture was shorter in the union group than in the nonunion group. The logistic regression analysis revealed that advanced age (> 45 years), long duration (> 2 months), and preoperative separation of the odontoid fracture (> 4 mm) were independently associated with the postoperative fracture nonunion. There were no differences between the 2 groups in JOA, neck pain, neck stiffness, and patient satisfaction at final follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: Advanced age, long duration, and preoperative separation of odontoid fracture > 4 mm are predisposing factors for fracture nonunion after posterior C1 lateral screw combined with C2 pedicle/laminar screw fixation for type II odontoid fracture. Our findings did not demonstrate any evidence of lower functional outcome and patients satisfaction for those patients who had odontoid nonunion.

AB OBJECTIVE: Central neurocytoma (CN) is a rare central nervous system tumor the optimal management strategy of which remains controversial because of their rarity. Detailed information on CN is necessary to establish optimal management strategies. The purpose of this study was to show the clinical features, treatments, and long-term clinical outcomes of CN.
   METHODS: A total of 63 patients with CN were surgically treated between 1995 and 2016 at West China Hospital. All pathologically proven CN cases were identified. Epidemiologic characteristics, clinical features, imaging features, functional outcomes, overall survival, and progression-free survival according to multimodal treatments were reviewed retrospectively.
   RESULTS: There were 29 males and 34 females, with a median age of 29 years (range, 15-58 years). Thirty-four patients underwent gross total resection (GTR) and 29 patients underwent subtotal resection (STR). The surgical approaches to CNs in this study included a transcortical approach (39 cases) and an interhemispheric transcallosal approach (24 cases). There were no differences in functional outcomes or initial extent of resection according to the surgical approach used. The extent of resection was GTR in 34 patients (54.0%), and STR in 29 patients (46.0%). At the median follow-up of 74 months (range, 6-205 months), the actuarial 5-year and 10-year overall survival were 93.3% and 85.4%. At the last follow-up, 8 patients had experienced tumor progression. The 5-year and 10-year progression-free rate was 73.4% and 57.5%. The initial extent of resection and multimodal treatment was not related to overall survival; however, the actuarial local control rate differed significantly according to the initial extent of resection and multimodal treatment.
   CONCLUSIONS: CN is a rare type of World Health Organization grade II primary brain tumor with a tendency to recur. Complete resection of CNs with maximal safety remains the primary treatment to minimize local progression. Adjuvant radiotherapy should be considered in patients receiving incomplete resection. The long-term clinical outcomes of CN after multimodal treatment seem to be satisfactory.

TI Effectiveness of the 3D Monitor System for Medical Education During
   Neurosurgical Operation
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE 3D monitor system; Medical education; Microsurgery; Neurosurgical
   operation
AB BACKGROUND: Three-dimensional (3D) graphics are used in the medical field, especially during surgery. Although 3D monitoring is useful for medical education, its effectiveness needs to be objectively evaluated. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of 3D monitoring in the surgical education of medical students.
   METHODS: A questionnaire on high-definition 3D monitoring was given to fifth-year medical students in a 6-year program. Sixty-four students wore polarized glasses and observed a microsurgical operation through a 3D monitor. The questionnaire contained questions on stereopsis, neurosurgical interest, visual impact, comprehension of surgical anatomy and procedures, optical sharpness, active learning enhancement, and eye exhaustion. These parameters were evaluated on a 5-point scale that spanned negative and positive scores.
   RESULTS: The average score of each parameter ranged from 3.13 to 3.78, except for eye exhaustion, which was 0.88. The items for which the students reported positive perceptions (scores of 4 or 5) were stereopsis (67.2% of students), neurosurgical interest (62.5%), visual impact and optical sharpness (60.9% for both), active learning enhancement (57.8%), and comprehension of surgical anatomy (50.0%) and procedures (42.2%). By contrast, only eye exhaustion was evaluated negatively (26.6%).
   CONCLUSION: The use of 3D monitoring systems in medical education offers the advantage of stereopsis and contributes to surgical training. However, improvements are required to decrease eye exhaustion.

AB OBJECTIVE: We investigated the prevalence, onset, characteristics, and long-term course of epilepsy disease in children who underwent surgical intervention for diagnosed brain tumors.
   METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of children with diagnosed brain tumors who underwent surgery during 2004-2014 at the Hadassah Medical Center. All patients with epilepsy were invited to a clinical visit that included a neurologic examination. The primary outcome measures were neurologic status according to the Glasgow outcome score (GOS) and postoperative seizure outcome according to the Engel system. We compared clinical characteristics according to the timing of epilepsy onset.
   RESULTS: The mean follow-up was 49 months. Of 128 patients included in the study, 44 (34%) had seizures; 23 (18%) developed epilepsy after surgery. Of the 30 patients with epilepsy who survived, 21 (70%) are in Engel class I and 13% Engel are in class II. Forty-five percent of the children are classified as GOS 5. Children who developed epilepsy after surgery were more likely to be in GOS 1-2 than were those who had seizures before surgery (P = 0.0173). Children with seizures were more likely to have cortical tumors and less likely to have tumors of the posterior fossa (P < 0.001). Children who underwent gross total resection were less likely to have epilepsy (P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: We show a high incidence of epilepsy in the late course of pediatric brain tumor disease. In the long term, seizure outcome was excellent. However, postsurgical onset of epilepsy was associated with a less favorable neurologic outcome.

AB STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective study.
   OBJECTIVES: Anterior cervical fusion surgery is widely used procedure in cervical spondylosis. When considering the blood reinfusion strategies of cervical fusion surgery, the amount of blood loss is one of the key elements. We usually calculate the blood loss according to the surgical bleeding plus the postoperative drainage; however, this method ignores the possibility that there may be hidden blood loss (HBL).
   METHODS: We performed a retrospective study to determine the risk factors for HBL in patients who underwent anterior cervical fusion surgery for degenerative spine from 2013 to 2016. The Pearson correlation, Spearman correlation, and multivariate liner analysis were used to find association between patient characteristics and HBL.
   RESULTS: A total of 107 consecutive patients who underwent anterior cervical fusion surgery for degenerative spine in our hospital were reviewed. The amount of HBL was 261 mL, or 50% of the total blood loss. According to the model of multiple linear regression analysis, patient sex (P = 0.028) and American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification (P = 0.029) were independent risk factors contributing to HBL, but preoperative hematocrit was not (P = 0.741).
   CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that sex and American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification were independent risk factors of HBL in anterior cervical fusion surgery. In addition, there was a high proportion of HBL in anterior cervical fusion. When considering the strategies of transfusion, we should pay attention to the risk factors for HBL.

AB OBJECTIVE: An intradural extramedullary bronchogenic cyst (IEBC) is a congenital malformation and an extremely rare type of endodermal cyst. This study aims to report the clinical and radiologic characteristics and surgical outcomes of IEBCs and to review the available literature.
   METHODS: The medical records of 6 patients (3 female) with pathologically confirmed bronchogenic cysts involving the spinal cord between 2009 and 2016 were retrospectively reviewed, and follow-up evaluations were performed.
   RESULTS: Of the 6 symptomatic lesions, 4 were located in the cervical vertebra, 1 at the lumbar vertebra, and the remaining 1 at the craniocervical junction. Radiographs showed signals similar to cerebral spinal fluid on all magnetic resonance imaging sequences without contrast enhancement. Total resection was achieved in 3 patients. Histopathology revealed simple and pseudostratified respiratory epithelium with benign subepithelial mucous glands and fat components neighboring the cyst. After a mean follow-up duration of 49.2 months, 2 asymptomatic residual lesions regrew after nontotal resection. In previous literature including 19 cases, most IEBCs (84.2%) tended to be homogeneous and well demarcated on radiologic images, and 85.7% were not contrast enhancing. Cervical or upper thoracic segments were predilection sites with intradural extramedullary localization. The majority of IEBCs had similar benign histological features. The recurrence rate was 15.4% after nontotal resection but nil after total resection.
   CONCLUSIONS: IEBCs displayed an indolent course, and the most effective management with positive outcomes was total resection. Nontotal resection, cystic fenestration, and biopsy, which were associated with recurrence, should be avoided.

AB BACKGROUND: Genetic risk factors can contribute to the etiology of intracranial aneurysms (IAs), and the genetic predisposition of IAs is largely unknown. Our study aimed to explore the role of rare variations in IA susceptibility.
   METHODS: Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed in a representative family with a history of multiple cases of IAs. WES variants were prioritized by various filtering strategies, including frequency, predicted pathogenicity, and functional prediction. Sanger sequencing also was performed in an additional 2 families and sporadic IA cases.
   RESULTS: After WES and filtering, 15 single-nucleotide variants and 3 insertion/deletions (indels) were prioritized in the family. Among them, we selected 5 candidate variants (located in DHRS3, OR2G3, LOXL2, FGL1, and KLC3) by considering known disease genes or ontology association with cardiovascular morphogenesis or other known diseases. Genotyping results revealed that only c.C133T/p. H45Y in exon 2 of LOXL2 gene was segregated fully with definite IA phenotypes in the family. Moreover, LOXL2 has been reported as a susceptibility gene for IAs.
   CONCLUSIONS: LOXL2 c. C133T is a pathogenic mutation that is responsible for a fraction of familial IAs.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate safety and effectiveness of supraorbital keyhole approach to the sella and anterior skull base via a forehead wrinkle incision.
   METHODS: We analyzed and reclassified forehead wrinkle types in 100 recruited healthy individuals. Twenty patients with different intracranial lesions in the sella and anterior skull base areas were selected for surgery using the supraorbital keyhole approach via a forehead wrinkle incision by forehead wrinkle type. All clinical patient records were retrospectively reviewed.
   RESULTS: Based on the feasibility of the surgical approach, the forehead wrinkles in Chinese individuals were categorized into 2 types: horizontal linear and nonlinear. Gross total removal of the lesions was achieved in 90% of the cases using this approach. All patients had excellent cosmetic results. Except for 2 patients with poor prognoses, a high level of comfort and satisfaction with the forehead wrinkle incisions was obtained based on the scale scores of pain from scars and headaches and satisfaction with the cosmetic results. No permanent approach-related complications occurred.
   CONCLUSIONS: The supraorbital keyhole approach via a forehead wrinkle incision was safe and effective. This approach provided a sufficient visual field for lesion resection and satisfactory cosmetic results for patients.

AB BACKGROUND: Patients with laminar fractures have a higher chance of experiencing severe trauma and neurologic deficit. In previous studies, laminar fractures were divided into different types based on the axial plane of computed tomographic scans. No report described the morphology of vertical laminar fractures in the coronal plane. Furthermore, the correlation between a specific type of laminar fracture and the extent of severity of thoracolumbar (TL) burst fractures has rarely been mentioned.
   METHODS: A retrospective evaluation of 341 patients with TL burst fractures with or without laminar fractures were divided into 6 groups based on the morphology observed across reconstructed coronal and axial computed tomographic planes. The Thoracolumbar Injury Classification and Severity Score (TLICS), Load Sharing Classification (LSC), and American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) impairment scale were evaluated for each patient. Inter-group comparisons were also performed for all metrics.
   RESULTS: The TLICS, LSC, and ASIA impairment scale were determined for each laminar fracture group. Statistical differences were found in most intergroup comparisons across all metrics. Significantly higher injury scores were observed in the groups with a more severe coronal and axial laminar fracture, and the injury severity in the coronal scan played a more decisive role.
   CONCLUSIONS: The morphology of vertical laminar fractures as observed across multiple image planes was more complex and accurate than an analysis based solely on the axial plane. Different morphologies indicated differences in the severity of associated TL burst fractures. The laminar fracture in the coronal plane was associated with the severity of spinal injury.

This study examined the amino acid sequences of these peptides and quantified in specimens.
   METHODS: The m/z 4588 and m/z 4473 peptides in CSF from patients with MMD were purified and concentrated by high-performance liquid chromatography and ultrafiltration. Liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry analysis was performed to identify the amino acid sequences of these peptides. We quantified these peptides in samples using sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and concentrations in CSF were compared between MMD (n = 40, 19 male; median age, 37 years) and non-MMD intracranial disease (n= 40, 19 male; median age, 39 years) as controls.
   RESULTS: These peptides were identified as proenkephalin 143-183 (PENK 143-183). The concentration of PENK 143-183 was significantly greater in patients with MMD (median, 8,270 pmol/L) than control patients (median, 3,760 pmol/L; P < 0.001) and decreased in an age-dependent manner in MMD (r = -0.57; P < 0.001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve in children (age < 18 years) was 0.885 (95% confidence interval 0.741-1). The correlation between proenkephalin concentration and temporal changes in moyamoya vessels was suggested.
   CONCLUSIONS: Proenkephalin 143-183 in CSF may offer a helpful diagnostic biomarker in pediatric MMD. The effect of enkephalin peptides through opioid growth factor receptor or delta opioid receptor might be associated with the pathophysiology of MMD.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between ultraearly hematoma growth (uHG) and clinical outcome in patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) receiving hematoma evacuation.
   METHODS: Supratentorial sICH patients receiving hematoma evacuation within 24 hours after ictus were enrolled in this study. uHG was defined as baseline hematoma volume/onset-to-computed tomography (CT) time (mL/h). The outcome was assessed by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at 3 months. Unfavorable outcome was defined as mRS >2.
   RESULTS: A total of 93 patients were enrolled in this study. The mean uHG was 10.3 +/- 5.5 mL/h. In 69 (74.2%) of patients, the outcome was unfavorable at 3 months. The uHG in patients with unfavorable outcome were significantly higher than in those with favorable outcome (11.0 +/- 6.1 mL/h vs. 8.3 +/- 2.5 mL/h, P = 0.003). The optimal cutoff of uHG for predicting unfavorable outcome was 8.7 mL/h. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of uHG >8.7 mL/h for predicting unfavorable outcome were 56.5%, 75.0%, 86.7%, and 37.5%, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: uHG is a helpful predictor of unfavorable outcome in sICH patients treated with hematoma evacuation. The optimal cutoff of uHG to assist in predicting unfavorable outcome in sICH patients receiving hematoma evacuation is 8.7mL/h.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of 2-isocenter Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) by reviewing patients with trigeminal neuralgia (TN) from the last 10 years.
   METHODS: A total of 247 patients were followed up and the Barrow Neurological Institute scale was used to evaluate pain degree. Patients' age, gender, pain duration and location, preoperative/postoperative Barrow Neurological Institute scale score, time to initial pain relief, recurrence time, and complications were documented and analyzed.
   RESULTS: Patients who underwent a 2-isocenter GKS achieved earlier initial pain relief. The median time of initial pain relief was 2.0 months. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the patients with a shorter history of TN and the patients without preoperative surgery achieved earlier initial pain relief. During the 122.8 months of follow-up, the median time of recurrence-free pain relief was 49.7 months. Age was found to be a risk factor of recurrence. Patients who underwent 2-isocenter GKS had a higher rate of postoperative facial numbness, but only 9 cases reported bothersome facial numbness. Multibranch involvement was a risk factor for postoperative facial numbness.
   CONCLUSIONS: Compared with other modalities, 2-isocenter GKS was a safe and highly effective option for patients with TN. However, more data need to be collected to verify its long-term effect.

ID BOTULINUM TOXIN TREATMENT; SAFETY; BLEPHAROSPASM
AB OBJECTIVE: Hemifacial spasm (HFS) is a disorder characterized by intermittent, involuntary facial muscle contractions. Microvascular decompression (MVD) is the gold treatment for HFS. The aim of this research was to discuss whether patients undergoing MVD as their initial surgical intervention experience greater spasm control than patients experiencing an MVD performed as a subsequent surgical intervention.
   METHODS: The study included 976 patients with HFS, 452 of whom (group A) underwent MVD as their initial surgical intervention and 524 of whom (group B) underwent subsequent MVD. Relevant clinical data including outcome of MVD, operative findings, complications, and so on were collected immediately after MVD operation and at follow-up.
   RESULTS: The follow-up period was 7-9 years (mean, 7.96 +/- 0.87 years). The mean age at intervention was 53.14 years and 55.43 years in the 2 groups, respectively. The long-term postoperative relief rate of patients in the 2 groups was 98.23% and 87.21%, respectively. There was a significant difference in long-term postoperative relief rate of patients between the 2 groups (P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients undergoing MVD for HFS as the primary treatment experience better long-term efficacy than patients first treated with botulinum neurotoxin type A.

DT Article
DE Bilateral; Etiology; Microvascular decompression; Trigeminal neuralgia
ID HEMIFACIAL SPASM
AB BACKGROUND: Bilateral trigeminal neuralgia is a relatively rare disease. Microvascular decompression (MVD) is a safe and effective treatment for unilateral trigeminal neuralgia; however, its utility in bilateral trigeminal neuralgia is unclear. Here, we report our experience with MVD in 13 cases of primary bilateral trigeminal neuralgia.
   METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 13 cases of bilateral trigeminal neuralgia that were treated with MVD between January 2013 and January 2015. Surgical outcomes and complications were explored in each case.
   RESULTS: Postoperatively, 11 patients had excellent outcomes and 2 patients had good outcomes on the operative side. Three patients also reported the amelioration of contralateral symptoms after MVD. Of 10 cases indicating no contralateral improvement, 1 refused to undergo a second MVD procedure on the opposite side and 9 underwent a second MVD procedure and experienced symptom relief. The superior cerebellar artery was the most common offending vessel. There were no severe MVD-related complications.
   CONCLUSION: Vascular compression plays a causative role in bilateral and unilateral trigeminal neuralgia. MVD appears to be a safe and effective treatment option in patients who are refractory to pharmacotherapy.

AB OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to identify novel targets of diagnosis, therapy, and prognosis for glioblastoma, as well as to verify the therapeutic effect of JNJ-7706621 regarding glioblastoma.
   METHODS: The gene expression profiles of GSE42656, GSE50161, and GSE86574 were obtained respectively from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified with comparison between gene expression profiles of the glioblastoma tissues and normal tissues. Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analyses were performed. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and survival curve analysis were also conducted to verify the correlation between expression of hub genes and prognosis. Moreover, in vitro, MTT assay, colony-forming assay, the scratch assay, and flow cytometry were performed to verify the therapeutic effect of JNJ-7706621.
   RESULTS: AURKA, NDC80, KIF4A, and NUSAP1 were identified as hub genes after PPI network analysis. Differential expression of those genes was detected between human normal glial cells and glioblastoma cells by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (P < 0.05), and the survival curve analysis showed that the patients with low expression of gene AURKA, NDC80, KIF4A, and NUSAP1 had a significant favorable prognosis (P < 0.05). In vitro assays showed that JNJ-7706621 inhibited glioblastoma cellular viability, proliferation, and migration via inducing glioblastoma cells apoptosis.
   CONCLUSIONS: AURKA, NDC80, KIF4A, and NUSAP1 were significantly more highly expressed in glioblastoma cells than in human normal glial cell. Patients with low expression of those 4 genes had a favorable prognosis. JNJ-7706621 was a potential drug in treatment of patients with glioblastoma.

   CHILDREN; MANAGEMENT; LESIONS; EPIDEMIOLOGY; ADULTS
AB BACKGROUND: Surgical treatment of retrochiasmatic craniopharyngiomas is associated with higher rates of complications, mortality, failure of complete removal, and recurrence compared with craniopharyngiomas located elsewhere. These tumors lie behind the optic chiasm and when large can extend upward into the third ventricle and downward along the brain stem, making their adequate exposure challenging. Most of the proposed techniques either use a translamina terminalis route or require wide bony exposures. In this study, we assessed the feasibility of a subtemporal approach for achieving gross total resection of retrochiasmatic craniopharyngiomas.
   METHODS: Thirty patients with retrochiasmatic craniopharyngioma underwent surgery via a subtemporal approach. The technique and surgical and preoperative and postoperative endocrinologic outcomes are described in detail.
   RESULTS: Gross total resection was achieved in all cases. The average tumor volume was 7.59 mL. The average postsurgical observation time was 73.8 months. During this time, 3 recurrences were observed (10.7%). The perioperative mortality was 6.6%. The pituitary stalk was preserved in 13 cases. Partial preservation of the pituitary stalk did not offer any advantage in terms of pituitary function. No postoperative vision worsening or new fixed neurologic deficits were observed. Among the 22 patients with preoperative vision impairment, 18 reported a significant improvement. The most common abnormalities within the temporal lobe on the side of the exposure seen on control magnetic resonance imaging were mild temporal horn enlargement (13 cases) and T2 hyperintensity (7 cases).
   CONCLUSIONS: A subtemporal approach can be an attractive alternative approach to accessing retrochiasmatic craniopharyngiomas. Outcomes are comparable to those associated with other widely used and timeconsuming exposures.

AB Media type is a critical design consideration when implementing biofiltration for drinking water treatment. Granular activated carbon (GAC) has been shown to provide superior performance when compared to a wide range of media types, largely due to its higher surface area. Engineered ceramic media is an attractive alternative to GAC as it has a similar surface area but at a lower cost.
   This pilot-scale biofiltration study compared the performance of GAC, anthracite and two different effective sizes of ceramic (CER) media (1.0 mm and 1.2 mm), in terms of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), head loss, turbidity, and disinfection by-product formation potential (DBPFP). Biological acclimation was monitored using adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP) measurements; biomass was further examined using laccase and esterase enzyme activity assays.
   When compared to other media types examined, biological GAC had higher (p > 0.05) removals of DOC (9.8 +/- 3.8%), trihalomethane formation potential (THMFP, 26.3 +/- 10.2%), and haloacetic acid formation potential (HAAFP, 27.2 +/- 14.0%). CER media required 6-7 months to biologically acclimate, while filters containing GAC and anthracite were biologically active (>100 ng of ATP/g media) following 30-45 days of operation. Once acclimated, ATP values of 243 and 208 ng/g attained for CER 1.0 and 1.2, respectively, were statistically comparable to GAC (244 ng/g) and higher than anthracite (110 ng/g), however this did not translate into greater organics removal. Esterase and laccase enzyme kinetics were highest for GAC, while CER was shown to have greater biodegradation potential than anthracite. The four media types attained similar turbidity reduction (p > 0.05), however ceramic media filters were observed to have run times which were 1.5-2.3 times longer when compared to anthracite, which could represent potential cost savings in terms of energy for pumping and backwash requirements. Overall, ceramic media was shown to be a potential alternative to anthracite when considering biofiltration, especially during cold water conditions (T < 10 degrees C). (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Bluephage: A rapid method for the detection of somatic coliphages used

AB The use of somatic coliphages as indicators of fecal and viral pollution in water and food has great potential due to the reliability, reproducibility, speed and cost effectiveness of methods for their detection. Indeed, several countries already use this approach in their water management policies. Although standardized protocol's for somatic coliphage detection are available, user-friendly commercial kits would facilitate their routine implementation in laboratories. The new method presented here allows detection of up to 1 somatic coliphage in under 3.5 h, well within one working day. The method is based on a modified Escherichia coil strain with knocked-out uidB and uidC genes, which encode the transport of glucuronic acid inside cells, and overexpressing uidA, which encodes the enzyme beta-glucuronidase. The enzyme accumulated in the bacterial cells only has contact with its substrate after cell lysis, such as that caused by phages, since the strain cannot internalize the substrate. When the enzyme is released into the medium, which contains a chromogen analogous to glucuronic acid, it produces a change of color from yellow to dark blue. This microbiological method for the determination of fecal pollution via the detection of culturable microorganisms can be applied to diverse sample types and volumes for qualitative (presence/absence) and quantitative analysis and is the fastest reported to date.

AB Oyster norovirus outbreaks pose increasing risks to human health and seafood industry worldwide but exact causes of the outbreaks are rarely identified, making it highly unlikely to reduce the risks. This paper presents a genetic programming (GP) based approach to identifying the primary cause of oyster norovirus outbreaks and predicting oyster norovirus outbreaks in order to reduce the risks. In terms of the primary cause, it was found that oyster norovirus outbreaks were controlled by cumulative effects of antecedent environmental conditions characterized by low solar radiation, low water temperature, low gage height (the height of water above a gage datum), low salinity, heavy rainfall, and strong offshore wind. The six environmental variables were determined by using Random Forest (RF) and Binary Logistic Regression (BLR) methods within the framework of the GP approach. In terms of predicting norovirus outbreaks, a risk-based GP model was developed using the six environmental variables and various combinations of the variables with different time lags. The results of local and global sensitivity analyses showed that gage height, temperature, and solar radiation were by far the three most important environmental predictors for oyster norovirus outbreaks, though other variables were also important. Specifically, very low temperature and gage height significantly increased the risk of norovirus outbreaks while high solar radiation markedly reduced the risk, suggesting that low temperature and gage height were associated with the norovirus source while solar radiation was the primary sink of norovirus. The GP model was utilized to hindcast daily risks of oyster norovirus outbreaks along the Northern Gulf of Mexico coast. The daily hindcasting results indicated that the GP model was capable of hindcasting all historical oyster norovirus outbreaks from January 2002 to June 2014 in the Gulf of Mexico with only two false positive outbreaks for the 12.5-year period. The performance of the GP model was characterized with the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve of 0.86, the true positive rate (sensitivity) of 78.53% and the true negative rate (specificity) of 88.82%, respectively, demonstrating the efficacy of the GP model. The findings and results offered new insights into the oyster norovirus outbreaks in terms of source, sink, cause, and predictors. The GP model provided an efficient and effective tool for predicting potential oyster norovirus outbreaks and implementing management interventions to prevent or at least reduce norovirus risks to both the human health and the seafood industry.

AB Point and diffuse sources associated with historical metal ore mining are major causes of metal pollution. The understanding of metal behaviour and fate has been improved by the integration of water chemistry, metal availability and toxicity. Efforts have been devoted to the development of efficient methods of assessing and managing the risk posed by metals to aquatic life and meeting national water quality standards. This study focuses on the evaluation of current water quality and ecotoxicology techniques for metal assessment of an upland limestone catchment located within a historical metal (lead ore) mining area in northern England. Within this catchment, metal toxicity occurs at circumneutral pH (6.2-7.5). Environmental Quality Standards (EQSs) based on a simple single concentration approach like hardness based EQS (EQS-H) are more overprotective, and from sixteen sites monitored in this study more than twelve sites (>75%) failed the EQSs for Zn and Pb. By increasing the complexity of assessment tools (e.g. bioavailability-based (EQS-B) and WHAM-F-TOX), less conservative limits were provided, decreasing the number of sites with predicted ecological risk to seven (44%). Thus, this research supports the use of bioavailability-based approaches and their applicability for future metal risk assessments. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB For millions of people worldwide, sewage-polluted surface waters threaten water security, food security and human health. Yet the extent of the problem and its causes are poorly understood. Given rapid widespread global urbanisation, the impact of urban versus rural populations is particularly important but unknown. Exploiting previously unpublished archival data for the Ganga (Ganges) catchment, we find a strong non-linear relationship between upstream population density and microbial pollution, and predict that these river systems would fail faecal coliform standards for irrigation waters available to 79% of the catchment's 500 million inhabitants. Overall, this work shows that microbial pollution is conditioned by the continental-scale network structure of rivers, compounded by the location of cities whose growing populations contribute c. 100 times more microbial pollutants per capita than their rural counterparts.

AB Different media materials in a multimedia filter have the potential to trap particles of different characteristics dependent on the media-suspension particle interactions. However, the removal of particles from wastewater secondary effluent using granular media filtration is relatively poorly understood because of the complexity of the wastewater matrix. Often the wastewater treatment process is liable to undergo pH changes due to removal or addition of chemicals in the treatment chain or from biological instability which in turn may alter the wastewater characteristics. Wastewater contains a mixture of organic and inorganic components, dissolved or particulate which may influence the aggregation and deposition of suspension solids during depth filtration. Changes in wastewater pH has the potential to change the wastewater matrix and media surface properties hence affecting aggregation and deposition in wastewater filtration. This study investigated how pH change affects wastewater filtration by monitoring zeta potential, aggregation and deposition of solids. The wastewater and filter media were also characterised over a range of pH from 1 to 13. Aggregation and deposition of wastewater solids was found to be most efficient near neutral pH. This was not concurrent with the conditions of lowest net charge in the system. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This work reports the monitoring and assessment of naphthenic acids (NAs) in oil sands process-affected water (OSPW), Pleistocene channel aquifer groundwater (PLCA), and oil sands basal aquifer groundwater (OSBA) from an active oil sands development in Alberta, Canada, using ultra performance liquid chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-TOF-MS) analysis with internal standard (ISTD) and external standard (ESTD) calibration methods and Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS) for compositional analysis. PLCA was collected at 45-51 m depth and OSBA was collected at 67-144 m depth. Results of O-x-NA concentrations follow an order as OSPW > OSBA > PLCA, indicating that occurrences of NAs in OSBA were likely related to natural bitumen deposits instead of OSPW. Liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) was applied to avoid the matrix effect for the ESTD method. Reduced LLE efficiency accounted for the divergence of the ISTD and ESTD calibrated results for oxidized NAs. Principle component analysis results of 02 and 04 species could be employed for differentiation of water types, while classical NAs with C13-15 and Z (-4) (-6) and aromatic 02 NAs with C16-18 and Z (-14)-(-16) could be measured as marker compounds to characterize water sources and potential temporal variations of samples, respectively. FTICR-MS results revealed that compositions of NA species varied greatly among OSPW, PLCA, and OSBA, because of NA transfer and transformation processes. This work contributed to the understanding of the concentration and composition of NAs in various types of water, and provided a useful combination of analytical and statistical tools for monitoring studies, in support of future safe discharge of treated OSPW.

This work investigated how nitrocellulose, a common binding material in propellants, may control the release dynamics of nitroglycerin (NG) and 2,4-dinitrotoluene (2,4-DNT) from propellant residues. Batch adsorption/desorption experiments on nitrocellulose and re-interpretation on results from past leaching studies involving propellant-bound EMs were conducted. Mechanistic modeling of adsorption/desorption kinetics based on intra-particle diffusion (IPD) predicted aqueous intrinsic diffusivities (D-IW) to within a factor of 2 of expected values. Furthermore, the IPD model was able to predict effective diffusivities (D-ew) during the early leaching of NG from propellant residues to within a factor of 2 over a 3-log unit range. Prediction of leaching D-eff's associated with fired residues was less successful probably due to the neglect of compositional and morphological heterogeneity within the residues. Close correlations were found between the early and late D-effs of residue-bound NG and between the fast-and slow-domain rate constants for both EMs, suggesting that the late leaching kinetics of bound-EMs may be empirically assessed from the early kinetics. This work illustrates that, in addition to dissolution, retarded diffusion through nitrocellulose matrix may also limit the overall release and transformation of residue-bound EMs in the field. Implications and limitations of the current study, and the steps forward are also presented. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Human fecal pollution of recreational waters remains a public health concern worldwide. As a result, there is a growing interest in the application of human-associated fecal source identification quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) technologies for water quality research and management. However, there are currently no standardized approaches for field implementation and interpretation of qPCR data. In this study, a standardized HF183/BacR287 qPCR method was combined with a water sampling strategy and a novel Bayesian weighted average approach to establish a human fecal contamination score (HFS) that can be used to prioritize sampling sites for remediation based on measured human waste levels. The HFS was then used to investigate 975 study design scenarios utilizing different combinations of sites with varying sampling intensities (daily to once per weelc) and number of qPCR replicates per sample (2-14 replicates). Findings demonstrate that site prioritization with HFS is feasible and that both sampling intensity and number of qPCR replicates influence reliability of HFS estimates. The novel data analysis strategy presented here provides a prescribed approach for the implementation and interpretation of human associated HF183/BacR287 qPCR data with the goal of site prioritization based on human fecal pollution levels. In addition, information is provided for future users to customize study designs for optimal HFS performance. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper deals with reactions occurring in the aqueous system of 2-propanol/ozone. The considered reactions are discussed from thermodynamic and kinetic points of view. The major finding refers to the fact that 2-propanol reacts with O-3 mainly via hydride transfer:
   (HO)(H3C)(2)C-H + O-3 -> [(HO)(H3C)(2)C+ + HO3-](cage) -> (HO)(H3C)(2)C+ + HO3-->(H3C)(2) C=0 + H2O + O-2
   Arguments supporting this proposed mechanism. are: high exergonicity of reaction (Delta G = -234 kJ mot(-1) for the first two steps), low HO yield - (2.4 +/- 0.5)% and high acetone yield (87.2 1.5)%. Other oxidation products detected within the system are acetaldehyde - (1.4 +/- 0.1)%, formaldehyde - (4.0 +/- 0.1)%, acetic acid -(2.8 +/- 0.2)%, formic acid -(0.6 +/- 0.2)% and hydrogen peroxide (1.5 0.1)%. The temperature dependence of the second order rate constant for the reaction 2propanol + O-3 products is In k(II) = 29.64-8500 x T-1. The activation energy and pre -exponential factor derived from this relationship are (71 +/- 3) kJ mol(-1) and (7.5 +/- 6.4) x 10(12) M-1 s(-1), respectively. At 23 degrees C, the second order rate constant is K-II= (2.7 +/- 0.1) M-1 s(-1). The low reaction rate can be explained by the transfer of one hydride ion from 2-propanol to electrophilic ozone.

AB Treatment of drinking water decreases human health risks by reducing pollutants, but the required materials, chemicals, and energy emit pollutants and increase health risks. We explored human carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic disease tradeoffs of water treatment by comparing pollutant dose response curves against life cycle burden using USEtox methodology. An illustrative wellhead sorbent groundwater treatment system removing hexavalent chromium or pentavalent arsenic serving 3200 people was studied. Reducing pollutant concentrations in drinking water from 20 mu g L-1 to 10 mu g L-1 avoided 37 potential cancer cases and 64 potential non-cancer disease cases. Human carcinogenicity embedded in treatment was 0.2-5.3 cases, and non-carcinogenic toxicity was 0.2-143 cases, depending on technology and degree of treatment. Embedded toxicity impacts from treating Cr(VI) using strong base anion exchange were <10% of those from using weak base anion exchange. Acidification and neutralization contributed >90% of the toxicity impacts for treatment options requiring pH control. In scenarios where benefits exceeded burdens, tradeoffs still existed. Benefits are experienced by a local population but burdens are born externally where the materials and energy are produced, thus exporting the health risks. Even when burdens clearly exceeded benefits, cost considerations may still drive selecting a detrimental treatment level or technology. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Crude glycerol, a by-product from the biodiesel industry, can be converted by mixed microbial consortia into 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PDO) and volatile fatty acids. In this study, further conversion of these main products into polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) was investigated with the focus on 1,3-PDO. Two different approaches for the enrichment of PHA accumulating microbial consortia using an aerobic dynamic feeding strategy were applied. With the first approach, where nitrogen was present during the whole cycle, no net production of PHA from 1,3-PDO was observed in the fermented effluent, not even in a nitrogen-limited PHA accumulation assay. Nevertheless, experiments in synthetic substrates revealed that the conversion of 1,3-PDO to PHA was possible under nitrogen limiting conditions. Thus, a different enrichment strategy was formulated where nitrogen was limited during the feast phase to stimulate the storage response. Nitrogen was still supplied during the famine phase. With the latter strategy, a net production of PHA from 1,3-PDO was observed at a yield of 0.24 C-mol iPHA/C-mol 1,3-PDO. The overall yield from the fermented effluent was 0.42 C-mol PHA/C-mol substrate. Overall, the PHA yield from 1,3-PDO seemed to be limited, similarly to when using glycerol as a substrate, by a decarboxylation step and accumulation of other storage polymers such as glycogen, and possibly, lipid inclusions.

AB Biological hydrogen production was investigated in continuous acidogenic reactors fed with sucrose at 30 degrees C without pH control. In the first experimental phase, three reactors were compared: a structured fixed-bed (FB), a granular UASB (UG) and a flocculent UASB (UF-1). They were run at 3.3 h HRT and 33 gCOD L(-1)d(-1) OLR. Hydrogen production occurred throughout the experimental period with an average effluent pH of only 2.8. The FB, UG and OF-1 reactors presented volumetric hydrogen production rates (VHPR) of 95 +/- 69, 45 +/- 37 and 54 32 mLH(2) L(-1)h(-1), respectively; and H-2 yields (HY) of 1.5 +/- 0.8, 0.8 +/- 0.6 and 1.2 +/- 0.7 molH(2) mol(-1) sucroseconsumed, respectively. The OF-1 reactor showed intermediate VHPR and HY, but no declining trend, contrary to what was observed in the FB reactor. Thus, aiming at continuous and long-term H-2 production, a flocculent UASB was applied in the second experimental phase. In this phase, the HRT of the acidogenic reactor, which was named OF-2, was raised to 4.6 h, resulting in an OLR of 25 gCOD L(-1)d(-1). The VHPR and the HY increased considerably to 175 +/- 44 mLH(2) L(-1)h(-1) and 3.4 +/- 0.7 molH(2) mol(-1) sucros(consumed), respectively. These improvements were accompanied by greater sucrose removal, higher suspended biomass concentration, less production of lactate and more of acetate, and high ethanol concentration. Contradicting the current published literature data that reports strong inhibition of H-2 production by dark fermentation at pH less than 4.0, the OF-2 reactor presented stable, long-term H-2 production with satisfactory yields at pH 2.7 on average. 16 S rDNA sequencing revealed that two sequences assigned as Ethanoligenens and Clostridium accounted for over 70% of the microbiota in all the reactors. The non-necessity of adding alkalizing agents and the successful H-2 production under very acid conditions, demonstrated in this study, open a new field of investigation in biological hydrogen production by dark fermentation towards a more sustainable and feasible technology.

AB Hospital effluents are a major source for the occurrence of pharmaceuticals, in the environment. In this work, the treatment of synthetic urine polluted with chloramphenicol is studied by using three different conductive-diamond electrochemical oxidation technologies: electrolysis (single electrolysis), photo electrolysis and high-frequency ultrasound sonoelectrolysis. These technologies were evaluated at 10 and 100 mA cm(-2). Results shows that not only chloramphenicol but also other organics contained in urine are completely mineralized by electrolysis. Ammonium is the main inorganic nitrogen species formed and it can react with the electrogenerated hypochlorite, favouring the formation of chloramines. These species prevent the potential formation of perchlorate from chlorides contained in urine at low current densities (10 mA cm(-2)) and delay its occurrence at high current densities (100 mA cm(-2)). On the other hand, irradiation of ultraviolet (UV) light or high-frequency ultrasound (US) produce changes in the performance of the electrolytic treatment, but these changes are not as important as in other cases of study shown in the literature. Nonetheless, the effect of electroirradiated technologies seems to be higher and depends on the type of pollutant when working at low current densities (10 mA cm(-2)). It is positive in the case of the degradation of the antibiotic and the uric acid and negative in the case of urea where there is a clear antagonistic effect. Production of oxidants increases with the current density although in lower ratio than expected. These results are of great importance because clearly point out that electrolytic technologies can be applied to minimize the diffuse pollution associated to pharmaceuticals before discharge into municipal sewers.

AB Bioactive glass (BG) with uniform spherical morphology was prepared by EISA (Evaporation Induced Self Assembly) process using non-ionic Pluronic F127 as structure directing agent and phosphoric acid as a source of P2O5 and compared with conventional precursor triethyl phosphate (TEP). EISA method proceeds through ionic interaction mechanism by protonation of surfactant and silicic species. H3PO4 provides H+ and PO43- ions in reaction medium which play critical role in reaction mechanism. Hydrogen ions increase the protonation of H2O and surfactant, while PO43- ions act as bridging molecule between different cations, ensuring incorporation of phosphorus in BG network. TEP participates by proton acceptance mechanism, creating competitive environment. Thus H3PO4 facilitates the formation of BG in presence of non-ionic surfactant Pluronic F127. The prepared glasses were characterized by FTIR, SEM-EDX, TGA-DSC and BET surface analyzer. Uniform spherical morphology, improved dispersity, relatively large surface area and better cells focal attachment were observed for BG-H3PO4, prepared by using H3PO4. SiO2-CaO-P2O5 mol% composition of BG-H3PO4 was (66:24:10) close to the theoretical value (65:25:10), while for BG-TEP the actual ratio was (77:20.5:2.5). The surface reactivity, studied by soaking in simulated body fluid, showed rapid growth of hydroxyapatite with Ca/P ratio 1.67 on BG-H3PO4. The proliferation of MC3T3 cells on BG-H3PO4 was remarkably improved as compared to conventional BG. Thus BG-H3PO4 can be considered for biomedical applications in future especially for drug loading and composite application where homogeneous and uniform structure are of utmost importance.

AB Tungsten tellurite glasses (TeO2-WO3-ZrO2) doped with various concentrations of Yb3+ ions have been prepared by the conventional melt-quenching method and systematically studied their spectroscopic and laser properties. The spectroscopic properties and some of the laser parameters have been evaluated from the measured absorption and emission spectra. Emission cross-sections evaluated from the McCumber and the Fuchtbauer-Ladenburg methods are found to be in good agreement. The absorption and emission cross-sections are found to be in the range of 2.78-1.30 (x 10(-20) cm(2)) and 3.64-1.83 (x 10(-20) cm(2)), respectively, when Yb3+ ions concentration increases from 0.01 to 3.0 mol%. A significant change in luminescence spectral profile for higher concentration (> 0.1 mol%) of Yb3+ ions has been explained as due to reabsorption effects. An initial increase of lifetime for the F-2(5/2) level up to 0.5 mol% and decrease thereafter for higher concentrations (> 0.5 mol%) of Yb3+ ions has been explained with a suitable mechanism. The results of spectroscopic and laser parameters indicate that tungsten-tellurite glasses have potential applications as gain media for lasers and optical amplifiers.

AB To guarantee a long life span and high quality performance of glass including devices, a deep understanding of glass corrosion processes is required. The influence of adhering particles on the degradation behavior of glass surfaces is little investigated yet. Studies of particle-glass surface interaction are of practical interest when it comes to several technical applications implying particle exposition besides natural weathering and storage. Sahara sand was chosen for the investigation of the influence of adhering particles on glass corrosion as one example of harsh environmental conditions. The scope of this work is on chemical changes and crystallization effects that are induced by the adhering sand.
   Soda-lime-silicate glass produced in a float process and sand collected in the Moroccan Sahara have been investigated in this study. The glasses were weathered in a climate chamber (80 degrees C, 80% relative humidity) for up to 8 days - half of them with a thin sand layer, the other half without and subsequently compared to each other. The following investigation of the samples included optical and atomic force microscopy (AFM) as well as X-ray diffraction (XRD). Furthermore, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) combined with stepwise sputtering was used to generate element depth profiles and to investigate chemical changes of the glasses. The sand was examined with XRD and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX).
   The study shows that the adhering sand drastically enhances the leaching of the network modifiers Na and Ca and furthermore adsorbs them. It also effects crystallization processes: For sand-free weathered glasses the formation of dendritic trona and massive sodium bicarbonate layers could be verified within this study. While sand-weathering the formation of carbonates is suppressed due to the adsorption of network modifiers by the sand and the formation of aluminosilicates on the glass surface is observed. These aluminosilicates would lead in ongoing weathering to more drastic corrosion damages than carbonates due to their high alkalinity. Hence, sand is not an inert material only lowering the light transmittance of glasses when covering them. It actively changes the properties of glass surfaces and fastens their degradation.

AB The glass-forming region of the ternary TeO2 - ZnO - NiO system has been determined using a conventional melt-quenching method under controlled condition. The stable samples containing up to 35 mol% NiO were prepared by the rapid cooling technique while a low cooling rate was allowed to obtain glasses containing 15 mol% NiO. The formation of tellurium, zinc and nickel complex oxides (e.g. NiTe2O5, Zn3Te2O8) crystalline phases in a powder batches during the glass synthesis at different temperatures were studied. Investigations of the crystallization processes in glasses showed the formation of the same complex oxides phases as in the batch. The basic thermal properties of ternary glasses were determined by DSC and an increase of glass temperature with increase in the concentration of NiO in the glass matrix was shown. The optical absorbance spectrum of the glasses exhibited three broad bands with four maxima located at about 430, 720, 810 and 1320 nm corresponding to the d-d transitions of Ni2+ ion in octahedral coordination. The ligand field, splitting and Racah parameters were calculated and its dependence on the concentration of NiO was established.

AB Molecular dynamics simulations are performed to examine the dynamic response of amorphous solids to oscillatory shear at finite temperatures. The data were collected from a poorly annealed binary glass, which was deformed periodically in the elastic regime during several hundred shear cycles. We found that the characteristic tithe required to reach a steady state with a minimum potential energy is longer at higher temperatures and larger strain amplitudes. With decreasing strain amplitude, the asymptotic value of the potential energy increases but it remains lower than in quiescent samples. The transient decay of the potential energy correlates well with a gradual decrease in the volume occupied by atoms with large nonaffine displacements. By contrast, the maximum amplitude of shear stress oscillations is attained relatively quickly when a large part of the system starts to deform reversibly.

AB Chemical differentiation of atoms in the nanoscale by femtosecond laser treatment enabling the formation of periodical nanostuctures (nanogratings) is demonstrated for the first time in sodium silicate glass. We report periodical redistribution of Na+ cations in SiO2 matrix related to the formation of nanogratings in 15Na(2)O center dot 85SiO(2) glass. They are shown to be similar to nanogratings in silica glass but their inscription is a much longer process taking 10(5)-10(7) laser pulses. SEM, TEM and EDXA analysis revealed substantial migration of Na+ from the laser-irradiated area. Na+ cations remaining in nanogratings are accumulated at the boundaries or inside the 20-30 nm thick nanoplanes whereas the chemical composition of regions between the nanoplanes approaches to pure SiO2 making a drastic chemical differentiation on a nanoscale. Thus, the opportunity of optically driven nanoperiodical modulation of alkaline cation distribution inside the glass changing its properties in the nanoscale has been shown. This cation redistribution is expected to stimulate the search for new approaches to the design of complex nanostructured architectures in a glassy matrix.

AB Decoupling between the diffusion coefficients that control crystal growth (D-U) and viscous flow (D-eta) in deeply supercooled glass-forming liquids is one of the most celebrated, still unsolved, phenomena in glass science because it strongly impacts the analysis and prediction of crystallization kinetics. To further understand the decoupling phenomenon, we measured viscosity and crystal growth rates (of the crystalline surface layer growth and internally nucleated crystals) of a supercooled liquid with barium disilicate composition. We performed all measurements using glass samples from the same batch, a rare case that we call a "clean" experiment. This type of analysis is uncommon, and its aim is to minimize the uncertainty due to the composition variation that is inherent in laboratory glass production. The decoupling temperature (T-d), the glass transition temperature (T-g), the melting point (T-m), and the liquid fragility index were obtained and successfully used to test a recently derived relationship which allows one to estimate T-d by knowing only T-m and the viscosity curve. We also show, for the first time, that the reduced decoupling parameter, which gauges the degree of deviation between D-U and D-eta, does not depend on the crystal growth mechanism for the cases of Normal or Screw Dislocation growth.

AB The mass attenuation coefficients (mu(m)), effective atomic cross section (sigma(a)), effective atomic number (Z(eff)) and effective electron density (N-eff) of silicate glasses containing different concentrations of Bi2O3, PbO, and BaO (30-70% by weight) were obtained using MCNP-4C code, XCOM and XMuDat programs, in the energy range of 10 keV-10 MeV. The interpolation method was employed to extract Z(eff) and N-eff. The Auto-Z(eff) software was used to determine the Z(eff) as well. The MCNP-4C Code, XCOM and XMuDat programs and Auto-Z(eff) results were in good agreement. It was found that the mu(m) and sigma(a) values decrease with photon energy. Also the results indicate that sigma(a) and Z(eff) of glasses improve by increasing their Bi2O3, PbO and BaO contents, while increasing these contents to the same fraction has no significant effect on mu(m) in the energy range of 0.3-5 MeV, where the Compton Effect takes over as dominant process and N-eff do not follow certain rule. Above 0.1 MeV, lead oxide silicate glass showed the highest values of Z(eff) and sigma(a). Wherever possible, the simulated and calculated values were compared with experimental data.

AB This work compares and screens green, water-soluble silicate gelants for possible use in isolating high conductivity water paths in fractured carbonate formations. The impact of cation, K+, Na+, Li+, Al3+ in the structure of a silicate is investigated with regards to gelation time, gel strength, and gel shrinkage. Several activators, such as NaCl, HCl, HCl + NaCl, HCl + NaCl + CaCl2, SAAP (sodium acid pyrophosphate) and CitAc (citric acid), are tested with the silicate systems at 40 degrees C, 60 degrees C and 80 degrees C and evaluated based on their ability to form rigid gels and on gelation time. The ability of the silicate gelants to form gel and the gelation time are determined mainly by the type of silicate, the SiO2 to M2O ratio (M denotes a metal ion), the type and concentration of the activator, and temperature. Some silicates do not always form gels; when gels are formed for a given silicate gelant, the gelation time is a strong function of the activator type and concentration, and temperature. Other parameters tested include pressure, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) (chelating agent), and formaldehyde (bactericide for added xanthan).
   The impact of elevated pressure on the designed gelation time of silicate gelants is very important for field applications in the oil and gas industry. Results obtained from experiments conducted at high pressures (150 and 300 bar) and ambient temperature conditions showed that applied high pressures delay gelation of a given silicate gelant compared to gelation times observed at standard pressure and desired temperature conditions.
   Silicate gelants containing divalent ions display shorter gelation times at given conditions (silicate, activator, pressure and temperature) compared to ones of the same salinity without divalent ions. The use of EDTA as complexing agent to neutralize or partially control the impact of divalent ions on gelation time may not be efficient; therefore, the impact of these ions on gelant's gelation and gel properties must be considered. The addition of formaldehyde as bactericide to prevent long-term degradation of added xanthan was found to reduce gelation times and decrease gel strength. Formed gels from diluted Silicate A and Silicate C gelants (these gelants are defined in the next section of this paper) showed a similar behavior (gelation time) as the one of gels formed from non-diluted gelants.
   Gel shrinkage is a function of the gelant type and SiO2 to M2O ratio, temperature, and storage time. Silicate A gels display a low degree of shrinkage; Silicate C gels appear to be affected significantly by high temperatures (60 degrees C and 80 degrees C) with the gels displaying up to 80% shrinkage at long post-gelation storage times; Silicate C gels are less affected (lower shrinkage) at low temperatures (40 degrees C).

AB In order to test the prediction that Bi2O3 could function as a replacement for PbO in preparing glass with zero stress-optic response, a series of bismuth boroaluminosilicate glasses of the form Bi2O3x(0.86B(2)O(3)-0.10SiO(2)-0.04Al(2)O(3))(1-x) were prepared. These glasses were then subjected to structural characterization and optical analysis. B-11 and Al-27 magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and optical absorption spectroscopy were used to track the structural evolution of the glasses across the series, while the Senarmont method was employed to determine the stress-optic coefficient. Experiments indicated a zero stress-optic composition containing roughly 59 mol% Bi2O3. Various model glass structures were evaluated in the context of our previous model involving bond lengths and coordination numbers, and it was found that the prediction of this model was reasonable but that the elasto-optic response of the Bi-O bonds appears to be weak compared to that in Pb-O bonds.

AB Available data of density, molar volume, refractive index and molar refraction of Al2O3-SiO2 glasses have been analyzed. The analysis shows that any of these properties can be expressed in terms of a factor of SiO4 tetrahedron and another one related to a structural species of AlO3/2 formula. These factors, together with previously found factors of the modified AlO4 tetrahedra, are useful to calculate the properties of Li2O-Al2O3-SiO2 and CaO-Al2O3-SiO2 glasses with [Al2O3/(Li2O or CaO)] > 1. Structural forms of AlO4, AlO5 and AlO6 groupings are proposed, in which the charge compensation is attained through various distributions of 2-, 3- and 4- co-ordinated O2- ions. Any of these groupings is equivalent to the AlO3/2 formula. It is concluded that the studied properties are not sensitive to "coordination of Al3+ ions.

AB mu-XANES is used to study the modifications in the alkali and alkaline-earth environments induced by the Na+/ K+ ion-exchange process in various Na silicate glasses. The results indicate that the ion-exchange process induces a shortening of the Na-O, Ca-O and Mg-O bond distances. The contraction of the Na-O, Ca-O and Mg-O coordination shell allows a better accommodation of the K+ cations in the glass network and thereby leads to partial relaxation of the stress developed by the Na+/K+ ion-exchange. Nevertheless, despite the stress relaxation process, the K+ environment in the ion-exchanged glass is not equivalent to the one in Na,K-silicate as-melted glasses. Hence, this study clearly shows that the ion swapping forced K+ cations to occupy smaller sites which are not achievable via the melt quench route for glasses with the same K amount.

AB A series of mixed oxide-carbonate Al2O3-La2O2CO3 systems with the La/Al molar ratios of 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 have been synthesized by the sol-gel technique from aluminum isopropoxide and metallic lanthanum powder. During the synthesis of Al2O3-La2O2CO3 system, metallic lanthanum acts both as a precursor of lanthanum oxide and as secondary pH modifier of the gel solution. The traditional sol-gel method was modified to provide a better control over the final product surface parameters and structure. The obtained systems were amorphous and highly homogenic. The rate of the metal reaction was used as a limiting factor to control the gel formation. The obtained oxide systems are intended as a support for metallic phase catalysts. Calcination in air at 600 degrees C did not produce systems containing only oxides and the lanthanum (dioxy)carbonate phase was still present. This observation can be explained by the multi stage decomposition process of lanthanum acetate forming during the gel synthesis.
   The systems were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction, low temperature nitrogen adsorption, transmission and scanning electron microscopy (TEM, SEM and SEM/EDS), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and STIR spectra.

AB Differential scanning calorimetry was used to study enthalpy relaxation kinetics of the (GeS2)(y)(Sb2S3)(1 - y) glasses in the y = 0.1-0.9 compositional range. The relaxation behavior was described in terms of the phenomenological Tool-Narayanaswamy-Moynihan (TNM) model. Non-linear optimization procedure was used to determine unique set of relaxation parameters for each studied glass. With increasing GeS2 content the activation energy of enthalpy relaxation was found to steeply decrease whereas the glass transition temperature increased significantly. Both non-linearity and non-exponentiality features were not affected by compositional changes. Raman spectra have shown that the Ge-S structural units, as opposed to the Sb-S units, are significantly interconnected and create a 3-dimensional network capable of solely carrying the relaxation motions, which is in agreement with the interpretation of compositional evolution of relaxation parameters. Moreover, based on the present data the controversy regarding the (GeS2)(y)(Sb2S3)(1 - y) fragilities found in literature was clarified, and the free-volume concept employing the Avrami growth theory was disputed.

AB A lot of images are currently generated in many domains, requiring specialized knowledge of identification and analysis. From one standpoint, many advances have been accomplished in the development of image retrieval techniques based on visual image properties. However, the semantic gap between low-level features and high-level concepts still represents a challenging scenario. On another standpoint, knowledge has also been structured in many fields by ontologies. A promising solution for bridging the semantic gap consists in combining the information from low-level features with semantic knowledge. This work proposes a novel graph-based approach denominated Semantic Interactive Image Retrieval (SIIR) capable of combining Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR), unsupervised learning, ontology techniques and interactive retrieval. To the best of our knowledge, there is no approach in the literature that combines those diverse techniques like SIIR The proposed approach supports expert identification tasks, such as the biologist's role in plant identification of Angiosperm families. Since the system exploits information from different sources as visual content, ontology, and user interactions, the user efforts required are drastically reduced. For the semantic model, we developed a domain ontology which represents the plant properties and structures, relating features from Angiosperm families. A novel graph-based approach is proposed for combining the semantic information and the visual retrieval results. A bipartite and a discriminative attribute graph allow a semantic selection of the most discriminative attributes for plant identification tasks. The selected attributes are used for formulating a question to the user. The system updates similarity information among images based on the user's answer, thus improving the retrieval effectiveness and reducing the user's efforts required for identification tasks. The proposed method was evaluated on the popular Oxford Flowers 17 and 102 Classes datasets, yielding highly effective results in both datasets when compared to other approaches. For example, the first five retrieved images for 17 classes achieve a retrieval precision of 97.07% and for 102 classes, 91.33%. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved,

DE Fuzzy c-means; Interval type-2 FCM; Fuzzifier
AB Type-2 fuzzy sets are preferred over type-1 sets as they are capable of addressing uncertainty more efficiently. Fuzzifier values play a pivotal role in managing these uncertainties; still selecting an appropriate value of fuzzifier has been a tedious task. Generally, based on observation, a particular value of fuzzifier is chosen from a given range of values for a given dataset. In this paper, I have tried to adaptively compute suitable fuzzifier values of interval type-2 fuzzy c-means for a given pattern. Information is extracted from individual data points using histogram approach and this information is further processed to give us the two fuzzifier values m(1) and m(2). These obtained values are bounded within some upper and lower bounds based on existing methods. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Recently, the culture of sharing medical data has emerged impressively, reducing significantly the barrier to the development of medical research accordingly. As open-access large datasets result from this significant initiative, data mining techniques can be considered for the development of interpretable expert systems to help in diagnosis. However, the collaborative effort of information gathering yields heterogeneous databases because of technical and geographical factors. Indeed, on the one hand, the harmonization of protocols for data collection is still missing. On the other hand, cultural and social factors impact locally both the epidemiology and etiology of a given disease. Ignoring these factors could weaken the credibility of studies based on multi-site data. Thereby, our work tackles the development of computer aided diagnosis systems relying on heterogeneous data. For such a purpose, we propose a multi-level approach (inspired by multi-level statistical modeling) based on decision trees (in the sense of machine learning). This framework is applied on the public ADHD-200 collection for the study of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, a mixed integer nonlinear programming model (MINLP) is formulated to allocate the position of a number of unequal-area rectangular facilities within the continuum of a planar plant site with a predetermined fixed area. Facilities have predetermined dimensions and are not orientation-free. A continuous approach to the problem is taken. Constraints are developed to eliminate the possible overlap between the different facilities. The model accommodates for aisles, whether vertical or horizontal, as well as blocks and preference locations, where no facilities are allowed to be placed. The problem seeks to minimize total material handling the cost. Four test cases including one from the local industry is used to justify the developed model. The problem at hand is computationally intractable; hence, a novel Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm is developed to solve large instances of the problem. A unique heuristic algorithm is used for initialization. A multi-start search mechanism is implemented to increase the diversity and mitigate the chances of getting entrapped in local optima. For validation, a group of benchmark problems is being used. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Time series prediction is an important part of data-driven based prognostics which are mainly based on the massive sensory data with less requirement of knowing inherent system failure mechanisms. Support Vector Regression (SVR) has achieved good performance in forecasting problems of small samples and high dimensions. However, the SVR parameters have a significant influence on forecasting performance of SVR. In our current work, a novel SCA-SVR model has been presented where sine cosine algorithm (SCA) is used to select the penalty and kernel parameters in SVR, so that the generalization performance on unknown data can be improved. To validate the proposed model, the results of the SCA-SVR algorithm were compared with those of grid search and some other meta-heuristics optimization algorithms on common used benchmark datasets. The experimental results proved that the proposed model is capable to find the optimal values of the SVR parameters and can yield promising results. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Path inference is essential for many location-based services, and it infers vehicle moving paths from noisy and incomplete data captured by GPS devices mounted on vehicles. However, Path inference remains a highly challenging task due to uncertain measurements, dynamic road context and diverse personal preferences of drivers. Existing works usually mapped GPS observations to candidate paths by assuming the same road contexts and the same preference for all drivers, which is unreasonable in practice. To address those issues, we propose a graphical model ConPPI based on conditional random field for path inference, by simultaneously considering both the road average speed which is one of the most important contexts, and the personalized information in a unified model. To exploit these information, ConPPI learns the road average speeds from pair-wise location data and discovers the drivers' personal preferences collaboratively. Extensive experiments on subsets from a real world dataset show that ConPPI can accurately infer both road average speeds and personal preferences, which leads to better path inference performance when compared with state-of-the-arts techniques.

AB This paper presents a new approach for the treatment of uncertainty which is based on interval-valued fuzzy-rough numbers (IVFRN). It is shown that by integrating the rough approach with the traditional fuzzy approach, the subjectivity that exists when defining the borders of fuzzy sets is eliminated. IVFRN make decision making possible using only the internal knowledge in the operative data available to the decision makers. In this way objective uncertainties are used and there is no need to rely on models of assumptions. Instead of different external parameters in the application of IVFRN, the structure of the given data is used. On this basis an original multi-criteria model was developed based on an IVFRN approach. In this multi-criteria model the traditional steps of the BWM (Best-Worst method) and MABAC (Multi-Attributive Border Approximation area Comparison) methods are modified. The model was tested and validated on a study of the optimal selection of fire fighting helicopters. Testing demonstrated that the model based on IVFRN enabled more objective expert evaluation of the criteria in comparison with traditional fuzzy and rough approaches. A sensitivity analysis of the IVFRN BWM-MABAC model was carried out by means of 57 scenarios, the results of which showed a high degree of stability. The results of the IVFRN model were validated by comparing them with the results of the fuzzy and rough extension of the MABAC, COPRAS and VIKOR models. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The increasing number of video surveillance cameras is challenging video control systems. Monitoring centers require tools to guide the process of supervision. Different video analysis methods have effectively met the main requirements from the industry of perimeter protection. High accuracy detection systems are able to process real time video on affordable hardware. However some problematic environments cause a massive number of false alerts. Many approaches in the literature do not consider this kind of environments while others use metrics that dilute their impact on results. An intelligent video solution for perimeter protection must select and show the cameras which are more likely witnessing a relevant event but systems based only on background modeling tend to give importance to problematic situations no matter if an intrusion is taking place or not. We propose to add a module based on machine learning and global features, bringing adaptability to the video surveillance solution, so that problematic situations can be recognized and given the right priority. Tests with thousands of hours of video show how good an intruder detector can perform but also how a simple fault in a camera can flood a monitoring center with alerts. The new proposal is able to learn and recognize events such that alerts from problematic environments can be properly handled. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, we deal with the inventory management system of perishable products under the random demand and deterministic lead time in order to minimize the total cost of a retailer. We investigate two different ordering policies to emphasize the importance of the age information in the perishable inventory systems using Reinforcement Learning (RL). Stock-based policy replenishes stocks according to the stock quantities, and Age-based policy considers both inventory level and the age of the items in stock. The problem considered in this article has been modeled using Reinforcement Learning and the policies are optimized using Q-learning and Sarsa algorithms. The performance of the proposed policies compared with similar policies from the literature. The experiments demonstrate that the ordering policy which takes into account the age information appears to be an acceptable policy and learning with RL provides better results when demand has high variance and products has short lifetimes.

AB Topic models can provide us with an insight into the underlying latent structure of a large corpus of documents. A range of methods have been proposed in the literature, including probabilistic topic models and techniques based on matrix factorization. However, in both cases, standard implementations rely on stochastic elements in their initialization phase, which can potentially lead to different results being generated on the same corpus when using the same parameter values. This corresponds to the concept of "instability" which has previously been studied in the context of k-means clustering. In many applications of topic modeling, this problem of instability is not considered and topic models are treated as being definitive, even though the results may change considerably if the initialization process is altered. In this paper we demonstrate the inherent instability of popular topic modeling approaches, using a number of new measures to assess stability. To address this issue in the context of matrix factorization for topic modeling, we propose the use of ensemble learning strategies. Based on experiments performed on annotated text corpora, we show that a K-Fold ensemble strategy, combining both ensembles and structured initialization, can significantly reduce instability, while simultaneously yielding more accurate topic models.

ID CONVERGENCE; KERNEL
AB Particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is widely used in cluster analysis. However, it is a stochastic technique that is vulnerable to premature convergence to sub-optimal clustering solutions. PSO-based clustering algorithms also require tuning of the learning coefficient values to find better solutions. The latter drawbacks can be evaded by setting a proper balance between the exploitation and exploration behaviors of particles while searching the feature space. Moreover, particles must take into account the magnitude of movement in each dimension and search for the optimal solution in the most populated regions in the feature space. This study presents a novel approach for data clustering based on particle swarms. In this proposal, the balance between exploitation and exploration processes is considered using a combination of (i) kernel density estimation technique associated with new bandwidth estimation method to address the premature convergence and (ii) estimated multidimensional gravitational learning coefficients. The proposed algorithm is compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms using 11 benchmark datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository in terms of classification accuracy, repeatability represented by the standard deviation of the classification accuracy over different runs, and cluster compactness represented by the average Dunn index values over different runs. The results of Friedman Aligned-Ranks test with Holm's test over the average classification accuracy and Dunn index values indicate that the proposed algorithm achieves better accuracy and compactness when compared with other algorithms. The significance of the proposed algorithm is represented in addressing the limitations of the PSO-based clustering algorithms to push forward clustering as an important technique in the field of expert systems and machine learning. Such application, in turn, enhances the classification accuracy and cluster compactness. In this context, the proposed algorithm achieves better results compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms when applied to high-dimensional datasets (e.g., Landsat and Dermatology). This finding confirms the importance of estimating multidimensional learning coefficients that consider particle movements in all the dimensions of the feature space. The proposed algorithm can likewise be applied in repeatability matters for better decision making, as in medical diagnosis, as proved by the low standard deviation obtained using the proposed algorithm in conducted experiments.

DE Digital image inpainting; Texture and pattern preserving inpainting;
   High dimensional model representation method; Lagrange interpolation
AB Image inpainting can be defined as the process of filling missing regions in a given image with appropriate intensities. Intensity values of pixels in a missing area are expected to be associated with the pixels in the surrounding area. Interpolation-based methods that can solve the problem with a high accuracy may become inefficient when the dimension of the data increases. Also, they suffer from finding the underlying texture and pattern in the missing region. In this study, we propose a texture and pattern preserving interpolation-based algorithm for inpainting missing regions in color images. First, the proposed approach produces candidate inpainting results by interpolating to the observed data at the different neighborhoods of the missing region using High Dimensional Model Representation with Lagrange interpolation. Later, a final inpainting decision is given among the candidates for each pixel in the missing region for a texture and pattern preserving inpainting. This is achieved by combining the information obtained from co-occurrence matrix and from a patch found in the image that fits best to the missing region. We evaluate the performance of the proposed approach on various color images that include different texture and pattern. We also compare the proposed approach with the state-of-the-art inpainting methods in the literature. Experimental results demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

ID PROBABILISTIC FUNCTIONS
AB Stored-value cards, or prepaid cards, are increasingly popular. Like credit cards, their use is vulnerable to fraud, costing merchants and card processors millions of dollars. Prior techniques to automate fraud detection rely on a priori rules or specialized learned models associated with the customer. Mostly, these techniques do not consider fraud sequences or changing behavior, which can lead to false alarms. This study demonstrates how a transaction model can be dynamically created and updated, and fraud can be automatically detected for prepaid cards. A card processing company creates models of the store terminals rather than the customers, in part, because of the anonymous nature of prepaid cards. The technique automatically creates, updates, and compares hidden Markov models (HMM) of merchant terminals. We present fraud detection and experiments on real transactional data, showing the efficiency and effectiveness of the approach. In the fraud test cases, derived from known fraud cases, the technique has a good F-score. The technique can detect fraud in real-time for merchants, as card transactions are processed by a modern transaction processing system. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS; DIRECT LDA; SYSTEM; BHATTACHARYYA
AB Supervised linear dimensionality reduction (LDR) performed prior to classification often improves the accuracy of classification by reducing overfitting and removing multicollinearity. If a Bayes classifier is to be used, then reduction to a dimensionality of K-1 is necessary and sufficient to preserve the classification information in the original feature space for the IC-class problem. However, most of the existing algorithms provide no optimal dimensionality to which to reduce the data, thus classification information can be lost in the reduced space if K-1 dimensions are used. In this paper, we present a novel LDR technique to reduce the dimensionality of the original data to K-1, such that it is well-primed for Bayesian classification. This is done by sequentially constructing linear classifiers that minimise the Bayes error via a gradient descent procedure, under an assumption of normality. We experimentally validate the proposed algorithm on 10 UCI datasets. Our algorithm is shown to be superior in terms of the classification accuracy when compared to existing algorithms including LDR based on Fisher's criterion and the Chernoff criterion. The applicability of our algorithm is then demonstrated by employing it in diagnosing the health states of 2 ultrasonic flow meters. As with the UCI datasets, the proposed algorithm is found to have superior performance to the existing algorithms, achieving classification accuracies of 99.4% and 97.5% on the two flow meters. Such high classification accuracies on the flow meters promise significant cost benefits in oil and gas operations. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE Multi-label learning; Matrix factorization; Label correlation
ID SYSTEM
AB Multi-label learning is concerned with the classification of data with multiple class labels. This is in contrast to the traditional classification problem where every data instance has a single label. Multi-label classification (MLC) is a major research area in the machine learning community and finds application in several domains such as computer vision, data mining and text classification. Due to the exponential size of the output space, exploiting intrinsic information in feature and label spaces has been the major thrust of research in recent years and use of parametrization and embedding have been the prime focus in MLC. Most of the existing methods learn a single linear parametrization using the entire training set and hence, fail to capture nonlinear intrinsic information in feature and label spaces. To overcome this, we propose a piecewise-linear embedding which uses maximum margin matrix factorization to model linear parametrization. We hypothesize that feature vectors which conform to similar embedding are similar in some sense. Combining the above concepts, we propose a novel hierarchical matrix factorization method for multi-label classification. Practical multi-label classification problems such as image annotation, text categorization and sentiment analysis can be directly solved by the proposed method. We compare our method with six well-known algorithms on twelve benchmark datasets. Our experimental analysis manifests the superiority of our proposed method over state-of-art algorithm for multi-label learning. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The discovery of community structure is the basis of understanding the topology structure and social function of the network. It is also an important factor for recommendation technology, information dissemination, event prediction, and more. In this paper, we consider the structure and characteristics of the social network and propose an algorithm based on semi-supervised matrix factorization and random walk. The proposed method first calculates the transition probability between nodes through the topology of the network. The random walk model is then used to obtain the final walk probability, and the feature matrix is constructed. At the same time, we combine a priori content information in the network to build a must-link matrix and a cannot-link matrix. We then merge them into the feature matrix of the random walk to form a new feature matrix. Finally, the expectation of the number of edges is defined according to the factorized membership matrix. Results demonstrate the effectiveness and better performance of our method. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Fed-batch fermentation has gained attention in recent years due to its beneficial impact in the economy and productivity of bioprocesses. However, the complexity of these processes requires an expert system that involves swarm intelligence-based metaheuristics such as Artificial Algae Algorithm (AAA), Artificial Bee Colony (ABC), Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMAES) and Differential Evolution (DE) for simulation and optimization of the feeding trajectories. DE traditionally performs better than other evolutionary algorithms and swarm intelligence techniques in optimization of fed-batch fermentation. In this work, an improved version of DE namely Backtracking Search Algorithm (BSA) has edged DE and other recent metaheuristics to emerge as superior optimization method. This is shown by the results obtained by comparing the performance of BSA, DE, CMAES, MA and ABC in solving six fed batch fermentation case studies. BSA gave the best overall performance by showing improved solutions and more robust convergence in comparison with various metaheuristics used in this work. Also, there is a gap in the study of fed-batch application of wastewater and sewage sludge treatment. Thus, the fed batch fermentation problems in winery wastewater treatment and biogas generation from sewage sludge are investigated and reformulated for optimization. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

ID GLUCOSE; FEASIBILITY
AB Under glycemic variability, a characterization of the desired blood glucose (BG) behavior is needed to assess if a given artificial pancreas (AP) respects its specification. The specification is an essential element to detect any deviation from an adequate insulin policy. Specializing the monitoring specification is therefore of utmost importance as existing guidelines for diabetes management are general and do not take into account how the personal factors and lifestyle affect the glycemic behavior. Surely, recommending personalized monitoring specifications may provide flexible and appropriate treatment goals to be attained by diabetic patients in order to account for their actual treatment needs. In this work, we use machine learning models to characterize glycemic behavior in synthetic healthy individuals. To account for the day-by-day fluctuation in BG levels, we use a stochastic process superimposed on a deterministic model of the glucose-insulin dynamics. The obtained characterization of the glycemic behavior in healthy individuals is then used as the target class to predict, and thus recommend, personalized monitoring specifications to diabetic patients. Results show that the approach stands as a feasible strategy to recommending appropriate and realistic monitoring goals for diabetic patients based on healthy individuals who share a similar glycemic behavior. Eventually, the incorporation of a recommender approach on an intelligent monitoring system for the AP will allow on-line adaptation of the treatment requirements for each patient.

AB People with motor diseases have suffered from deprivation of both verbal and non-verbal communication abilities. Fortunately, some of them still retain coordination of brain and eye-motor. To establish a stable communication way for these disabled people, this paper presents an eye gesture perception system based on Electrooculography (EOG). In order to implement a high-accuracy of unit saccadic EOG signals recognition, we propose a new feature extraction algorithm based on Common Spatial Pattern (CSP). We first establish a CSP spatial filter bank corresponding to 8 saccadic tasks (i.e., up, down, left, right, right up, left-up, right-down, and left-down), then use it to linearly project raw EOG signals and treat the outputs as feature parameters. Furthermore, eye gestures recognition has been carried out by identifying and merging unit saccadic segments in terms of pre-defined time sequences. Experiential results over 10 subjects show that the recognition precision of unit saccadic EOG and eye gesture are 96.8% and 95.0% respectively, which reveal the proposed system has a good performance of eye gestures perception.

ID FAST SKEW DETECTION; ALGORITHM; ROTATION
AB This paper presents a general, ultra-fast approach for geometrical image transformations, based on the usage of linear lookup hash tables. The new method is developed to fix distortions on document images as part of a real-time optical character recognition (OCR) system. The approach is generalized and uses linear image representation combined with pre-computed lookup tables. Backward mapping is used for generation of lookup tables, while forward mapping is presented as an alternative and more efficient mapping model for specific cases. Also, a theoretical space and time complexity analysis of the proposed method is provided. To achieve maximal computational performance, pointer arithmetic and highly-optimized low-level machine code implementations are provided, including the specialized implementations for horizontal mirror, vertical mirror, and 90 rotation. Also, a modified variant of the approach, based on auto-generated machine code is presented. Very high computational performances are achieved at the expense of memory usage. The performances from the perspective of time complexity are analyzed and compared with classical implementation, FPGA implementation, and other implementations of the image rotation. Numerical results are given for a set of different PC specifications to provide full insight into the implementation performances. The processing time for very large images are below 200 ms for backward mapping and below 100 ms for forward mapping for most machines, which is 30-60 times faster than the classical implementation, 5-20 times faster than the FPGA implementation, and up to 6 times faster than other implementations of image rotation. Original documents belonging to Nikola Tesla are used for visual demonstration of performance. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Sparse coding and dictionary learning has recently gained great interest in signal, image and audio processing applications through representing each problem instance by a sparse set of atoms. This also allows us to obtain different representations of feature sets in machine learning problems. Thus, different feature views for classifier ensembles can be obtained using sparse coding. On the other hand, nowadays unlabelled data is abundant and active learning methods with single and classifier ensembles received great interest. In this study, Random Subspace Dictionary Learning (RDL) and Bagging Dictionary Learning (BDL) algorithms are examined by learning ensembles of dictionaries through feature instance subspaces. Besides, ensembles of dictionaries are evaluated under active learning framework as promising models and they are named as Active Random Subspace Dictionary Learning (ARDL) and Active Bagging Dictionary Learning (ABDL) algorithms. Active learning methods are compared with their Support Vector Machines counterparts. The experiments on eleven datasets from UCI and OpenML repositories has shown that selecting instance and feature subspaces for dictionary learning model increases the number of correctly classified instances for the most of the data sets while SVM has superiority over all of the applied models. Furthermore, using an active learner generally increases the chance of improved classification performance as the number of iterations is increased. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID EXPRESSION DATA
AB Knowledge discovery from data can be broadly categorized into two types: supervised and unsupervised. A supervised knowledge discovery process such as classification by decision trees typically requires class labels which are sometimes unavailable in datasets. Unsupervised knowledge discovery techniques such as an unsupervised clustering technique can handle datasets without class labels. They aim to let data reveal the groups (i.e. the data elements in each group) and the number of groups. For the ubiquitous task of clustering, K-MEANS is the most used algorithm applied in a broad range of areas to identify groups where intra-group distances are much smaller than inter-group distances. As a representative-based clustering approach, K-MEANs offers an extremely efficient gradient descent approach to the total squared error of representation; however, it not only demands the parameter k, but it also makes assumptions about the similarity of density among the clusters. Therefore, it is profoundly affected by noise. Perhaps more seriously, it can often be attracted to local optima despite its immersion in a multi-start scheme. We present an effective genetic algorithm that combines the capacity of genetic operators to conglomerate different solutions of the search space with the exploitation of the hill-climber. We advance a previous genetic-searching approach called GENCLUST, with the intervention of fast hill-climbing cycles of K-MEANS and obtain an algorithm that is faster than its predecessor and achieves clustering results of higher quality. We demonstrate this across a series of 18 commonly researched datasets. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A frequently asked questions (FAQ) retrieval system improves the access to information by allowing users to pose natural language queries over an FAQ collection. From an information retrieval perspective, FAQ retrieval is a challenging task, mainly because of the lexical gap that exists between a query and an FAQ pair, both of which are typically very short. In this work, we explore the use of supervised learning to rank to improve the performance of domain-specific FAQ retrieval. While supervised learning-to rank models have been shown to yield effective retrieval performance, they require costly human-labeled training data in the form of document relevance judgments or question paraphrases. We investigate how this labeling effort can be reduced using a labeling strategy geared toward the manual creation of query paraphrases rather than the more time-consuming relevance judgments. In particular, we investigate two such strategies, and test them by applying supervised ranking models to two domain-specific FAQ retrieval data sets, showcasing typical FAQ retrieval scenarios. Our experiments show that supervised ranking models can yield significant improvements in the precision-at-rank-5 measure compared to unsupervised baselines. Furthermore, we show that a supervised model trained using data labeled via a low-effort paraphrase-focused strategy has the same performance as that of the same model trained using fully labeled data, indicating that the strategy is effective at reducing the labeling effort while retaining the performance gains of the supervised approach. To encourage further research on FAQ retrieval we make our FAQ retrieval data set publicly available. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Over the last few decades, the advance of new technologies in computer equipment, cameras and medical devices became a starting point for the shape of medical imaging systems. Since then, many new medical devices, e.g. the X-Ray machines, computed tomography scans, magnetic resonance imaging, etc., accompanied with operational algorithms inside has contributed greatly to successful diagnose of clinical cases. Enhancing the accuracy of segmentation, which plays an important role in the recognition of disease patterns, has been the focus of various researches in recent years. Segmentation using advanced fuzzy clustering to handle the problems of common boundaries between clusters would tackle many challenges in medical imaging. In this paper, we propose a new fuzzy clustering algorithm based on the neutrosophic orthogonal matrices for segmentation of dental X-Ray images. This algorithm transforms image data into a neutrosophic set and computes the inner products of the cutting matrix of input. Pixels are then segmented by the orthogonal principle to form clusters. The experimental validation on real dental datasets of Hanoi Medical University Hospital, Vietnam showed the superiority of the proposed method against the relevant ones in terms of clustering quality.

DE RFID; Machine learning; Classification; False positive readings
ID LOCALIZATION
AB Radio frequency identification (RFID) has been widely used for the automatic identification, tracking and tracing of goods throughout the supply chain from the manufacturer to the customer. However, one technological problem that impedes the productive and reliable use of RFID is the constraint of false positive readings, which refers to tags that are detected accidentally by the reader but not the ones of interest. This paper focuses on the use of machine learning algorithms to identify such RFID readings. A total of 11 statistical features are extracted from received signal strength (RSS) and phase rotations derived from the raw RFID data. Each of the features is highly statistically different to distinguish the false positive readings, but satisfactory classification cannot be achieved when these features are considered individually. Classifiers based on logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM) and decision tree (DT) are constructed, which combine all of the extracted features to classify the RFID readings more effectively. The performance of the classifiers is evaluated in a real-world factory. Results show that SVM provides the highest accuracy of up to 95.3%. DT shows slightly better accuracy (92.85%) than LR (92.75%), while LR has the larger area under the curve (0.976) than DT (0.949). Overall, machine learning algorithms could achieve accuracy of 93% on average. The proposed methodology provides a much more reliable RFID application as false-positive readings are detected immediately without human intervention, which enables a significant potential of fully automatic identification and tracking of goods throughout the supply chain.

AB Learning from imbalanced datasets is a frequent but challenging task for standard classification algorithms. Although there are different strategies to address this problem, methods that generate artificial data for the minority class constitute a more general approach compared to algorithmic modifications. Standard oversampling methods are variations of the SMOTE algorithm, which generates synthetic samples along the line segment that joins minority class samples. Therefore, these approaches are based on local information, rather on the overall minority class distribution. Contrary to these algorithms, in this paper the conditional version of Generative Adversarial Networks (cGAN) is used to approximate the true data distribution and generate data for the minority class of various imbalanced datasets. The performance of cGAN is compared against multiple standard oversampling algorithms. We present empirical results that show a significant improvement in the quality of the generated data when cGAN is used as an oversampling algorithm. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Given the higher demands in network bandwidth and speed that the Internet will have to meet in the near future, it is crucial to research and design intelligent and proactive congestion control and avoidance mechanisms able to anticipate decisions before the congestion problems appear. Nowadays, congestion control mechanisms in the Internet are based on TCP, a transport protocol that is totally reactive and cannot adapt to network variability because its convergence speed to the optimal values is slow. In this context, we propose to investigate new congestion control mechanisms that (a) explicitly compute the optimal sessions' sending rates independently of congestion signals (i.e., proactive mechanisms) and (b) take anticipatory decisions (e.g., using forecasting or prediction techniques) in order to avoid the appearance of congestion problems.
   In this paper we present B-Neck, a distributed optimization algorithm that can be used as the basic building block for the new generation of proactive and anticipatory congestion control protocols. B-Neck computes proactively the optimal sessions' sending rates independently of congestion signals. B-Neck applies max-min fairness as optimization criterion, since it is very often used in traffic engineering as a way of fairly distributing a network capacity among a set of sessions. B-Neck iterates rapidly until converging to the optimal solution and is also quiescent. The fact that B-Neck is quiescent means that it stops creating traffic when it has converged to the max-min rates, as long as there are no changes in the sessions. B-Neck reacts to variations in the environment, and so, changes in the sessions (e.g., arrivals and departures) reactivate the algorithm, and eventually the new sending rates are found and notified. To the best of our knowledge, B-Neck is the first distributed algorithm that maintains the computed max min fair rates without the need of continuous traffic injection, which can be advantageous, e.g., in energy efficiency scenarios.
   This paper proposes as novelty two theoretical contributions jointly with an in-depth experimental evaluation of the B-Neck optimization algorithm. First, it is formally proven that B-Neck is correct, and second, an upper bound for its convergence time is obtained. In addition, extensive simulations were conducted to validate the theoretical results and compare B-Neck with the most representative competitors. These experiments show that B-Neck behaves nicely in the presence of sessions arriving and departing, and its convergence time is in the same range as that of the fastest (non-quiescent) distributed max-min fair algorithms. These properties encourage to utilize B-Neck as the basic building block of proactive and anticipatory congestion control protocols. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID FINITE-ELEMENT METHODS; ACCURACY
AB In coupled flow and poromechanics phenomena representing hydrocarbon production or CO2 sequestration in deep subsurface reservoirs, the spatial domain in which fluid flow occurs is usually much smaller than the spatial domain over which significant deformation occurs. The typical approach is to either impose an overburden pressure directly on the reservoir thus treating it as a coupled problem domain or to model flow on a huge domain with zero permeability cells to mimic the no flow boundary condition on the interface of the reservoir and the surrounding rock. The former approach precludes a study of land subsidence or uplift and further does not mimic the true effect of the overburden on stress sensitive reservoirs whereas the latter approach has huge computational costs. In order to address these challenges, we augment the fixed-stress split iterative scheme with upscaling and downscaling operators to enable modeling flow and mechanics on overlapping nonmatching hexahedral grids. Flow is solved on a finer mesh using a multipoint flux mixed finite element method and mechanics is solved on a coarse mesh using a conforming Galerkin method. The multiscale operators are constructed using a procedure that involves singular value decompositions, a surface intersections algorithm and Delaunay triangulations. We numerically demonstrate the convergence of the augmented scheme using the classical Mandel's problem solution. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper discusses issues in hyperbolic advection-diffusion schemes for high-Reynolds-number boundary-layer problems. Implicit hyperbolic advection-diffusion solvers have been found to encounter significant convergence deterioration for high-Reynolds-number problems with boundary layers. The problems are examined in details for a one-dimensional advection-diffusion model, and resolutions are discussed. One of the major findings is that the relaxation length scale needs to be inversely proportional to the Reynolds number to minimize the truncation error and retain the dissipation of the hyperbolic diffusion scheme. Accurate, robust, and efficient boundary-layer calculations by hyperbolic schemes are demonstrated for advection-diffusion equations in one and two dimensions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB We consider a class of time-dependent second order partial differential equations governed by a decaying entropy. The solution usually corresponds to a density distribution, hence positivity (non-negativity) is expected. This class of problems covers important cases such as Fokker-Planck type equations and aggregation models, which have been studied intensively in the past decades. In this paper, we design a high order discontinuous Galerkin method for such problems. If the interaction potential is not involved, or the interaction is defined by a smooth kernel, our semi-discrete scheme admits an entropy inequality on the discrete level. Furthermore, by applying the positivity-preserving limiter, our fully discretized scheme produces non-negative solutions for all cases under a time step constraint. Our method also applies to two dimensional problems on Cartesian meshes. Numerical examples are given to confirm the high order accuracy for smooth test cases and to demonstrate the effectiveness for preserving long time asymptotics. (C) 2017 The Author(s).

AB Empirical gas-surface interaction models, such as the Maxwell model and the Cercignani-Lampis model, are widely used as the boundary condition in rarefied gas flow simulations. The accuracy of these models in the prediction of macroscopic behavior of rarefied gas flows is less satisfactory in some cases especially the highly non-equilibrium ones. Molecular dynamics simulation can accurately resolve the gas-surface interaction process at atomic scale, and hence can predict accurate macroscopic behavior. They are however too computationally expensive to be applied in real problems. In this work, a statistical physical-based gas-surface interaction model, which complies with the basic relations of boundary condition, is developed based on the framework of the washboard model. In virtue of its physical basis, this new model is capable of capturing some important relations/trends for which the classic empirical models fail to model correctly. As such, the new model is much more accurate than the classic models, and in the meantime is more efficient than MD simulations. Therefore, it can serve as a more accurate and efficient boundary condition for rarefied gas flow simulations. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper outlines a novel approach for solution of the Boltzmann-BGK equation describing molecular gas dynamics applied to the challenging problem of drag prediction of a 2D circular nano-particle at transitional Knudsen number (0.0214) and low Reynolds number (0.25-2.0). The numerical scheme utilises a discontinuous-Galerkin finite element discretisation for the physical space representing the problem particle geometry and a high order discretisation for molecular velocity space describing the molecular distribution function. The paper shows that this method produces drag predictions that are aligned well with the range of drag predictions for this problem generated from the alternative numerical approaches of molecular dynamics codes and a modified continuum scheme. It also demonstrates the sensitivity of flow-field solutions and therefore drag predictions to the wall absorption parameter used to construct the solid wall boundary condition used in the solver algorithm. The results from this work has applications in fields ranging from diagnostics and therapeutics in medicine to the fields of semiconductors and xerographics.

AB This work proposes a methodology to improve the computational efficiency of unsteady flow simulations with dual time stepping scheme. The methodology is developed on the combination of dynamic mode extrapolation and dual time stepping scheme. It accelerates the convergence speed of the inner iterations by using dynamic mode extrapolation to provide an initial solution for each physical time step. The validation and verification are demonstrated by three cases, including unsteady flow past a stationary circular cylinder at Re = 200, transonic flow over periodic and non-periodic pitching NACA 0012 airfoil and buffeting flow around NASA(SC)-0714 airfoil. For comparison, Lagrange extrapolation initial condition and natural initial condition are also applied. The results confirm that the proposed methodology is very successful in reducing computational time for both incompressible and transonic unsteady flow. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We propose to apply a low dimensional manifold model to scientific data interpolation from regular and irregular samplings with a significant amount of missing information. The low dimensionality of the patch manifold for general scientific data sets has been used as a regularizer in a variational formulation. The problem is solved via alternating minimization with respect to the manifold and the data set, and the Laplace-Beltrami operator in the Euler-Lagrange equation is discretized using the weighted graph Laplacian. Various scientific data sets from different fields of study are used to illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithm on data compression and interpolation from both regular and irregular samplings.

AB Utility of the computational power of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) is elaborated for solutions of incompressible Navier-Stokes equations which are integrated using a semi-implicit fractional-step method. The Alternating Direction Implicit (ADI) and the Fourier-transform-based direct solution methods used in the semi-implicit fractional-step method take advantage of multiple tridiagonal matrices whose inversion is known as the major bottleneck for acceleration on a typical multi-core machine. A novel implementation of the semi-implicit fractional-step method designed for GPU acceleration of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations is presented. Aspects of the programing model of Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA), which are critical to the bandwidth-bound nature of the present method are discussed in detail. A data layout for efficient use of CUDA libraries is proposed for acceleration of tridiagonal matrix inversion and fast Fourier transform. OpenMP is employed for concurrent collection of turbulence statistics on a CPU while the Navier-Stokes equations are computed on a GPU. Performance of the present method using CUDA is assessed by comparing the speed of solving three tridiagonal matrices using ADI with the speed of solving one heptadiagonal matrix using a conjugate gradient method. An overall speedup of 20 times is achieved using a Tesla K40 GPU in comparison with a single-core Xeon E5-2660 v3 CPU in simulations of turbulent boundary-layer flow over a flat plate conducted on over 134 million grids. Enhanced performance of 48 times speedup is reached for the same problem using a Tesla P100 GPU. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A stopping criterion for iterative solution methods is presented that accurately estimates the solution error using low computational overhead. The proposed criterion uses information from prior solution changes to estimate the error. When the solution changes are noisy or stagnating it reverts to a less accurate but more robust, low-cost singular value estimate to approximate the error given the residual. This estimator can also be applied to iterative linear matrix solvers such as Krylov subspace or multigrid methods. Examples of the stopping criterion's ability to accurately estimate the non-linear and linear solution error are provided for a number of different test cases in incompressible fluid dynamics.

AB Spatial discretisation of geometrically complex computational domains often entails unstructured meshes of general topology for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Mesh skewness is then typically encountered causing severe deterioration of the formal order of accuracy of the discretisation, or boundedness of the solution, or both. Particularly methods inherently relying on the accurate and bounded transport of sharp fields suffer from all types of mesh-induced skewness errors, namely both non-orthogonality and non-conjunctionality errors.
   This work is devoted to a boundedness-preserving strategy to correct for skewness errors arising from discretisation of advection and diffusion terms within the context of interfacial heat and mass transfer based on the Volume-of-Fluid methodology. The implementation has been accomplished using a second-order finite volume method with support for unstructured meshes of general topology. We examine and advance suitable corrections for the finite volume discretisation of a consistent single-field model, where both accurate and bounded transport due to diffusion and advection is crucial. In order to ensure consistency of both the volume fraction and the species concentration transport, i.e. to avoid artificial heat or species transfer, corrections are studied for both cases using distorted 2D meshes. The cross interfacial jump and adjacent sharp gradients of species concentration render the correction for skewness-induced diffusion and advection errors additionally demanding and has not so far been addressed in the literature.

AB A domain decomposition method which couples a high and a low-fidelity model is proposed to reduce the computational cost of a flow simulation. This approach requires to solve the high-fidelity model in a small portion of the computational domain while the external field is described by a Galerkin-free Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) model. We propose an error indicator to determine the extent of the interior domain and to perform an optimal coupling between the two models. This zonal approach can be used to study multi-body configurations or to perform detailed local analyses in the framework of shape optimisation problems. The efficiency of the method to perform predictive low-cost simulations is investigated for an unsteady flow and for an aerodynamic shape optimisation problem. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB A discrete velocity method is developed for gas mixtures of diatomic molecules with both rotational and vibrational energy states. A full quantized model is described, and rotation-translation and vibration-translation energy exchanges are simulated using a Larsen-Borgnakke exchange model. Elastic and inelastic molecular interactions are modeled during every simulated collision to help produce smooth internal energy distributions. The method is verified by comparing simulations of homogeneous relaxation by our discrete velocity method to numerical solutions of the Jeans and Landau-Teller equations, and to direct simulation Monte Carlo. We compute the structure of a 1D shock using this method, and determine how the rotational energy distribution varies with spatial location in the shock and with position in velocity space.

AB A high-order spectral element discontinuous Galerkin method is presented for simulating immiscible two-phase flow in petroleum reservoirs. The governing equations involve a coupled system of strongly nonlinear partial differential equations for the pressure and fluid saturation in the reservoir. A fully implicit method is used with a high-order accurate time integration using an implicit Rosenbrock method. Numerical tests give the first demonstration of high order hp spatial convergence results for multiphase flow in petroleum reservoirs with industry standard relative permeability models. High order convergence is shown formally for spectral elements with up to 8th order polynomials for both homogeneous and heterogeneous permeability fields. Numerical results are presented for multiphase fluid flow in heterogeneous reservoirs with complex geometric or geologic features using up to 11th order polynomials. Robust, stable simulations are presented for heterogeneous geologic features, including globally heterogeneous permeability fields, anisotropic permeability tensors, broad regions of low-permeability, high-permeability channels, thin shale barriers and thin high-permeability fractures.
   A major result of this paper is the demonstration that the resolution of the high order spectral element method may be exploited to achieve accurate results utilizing a simple cartesian mesh for non-conforming geological features. Eliminating the need to mesh to the boundaries of geological features greatly simplifies the workflow for petroleum engineers testing multiple scenarios in the face of uncertainty in the subsurface geology.

AB Characterizing and controlling nonlinear, multi-scale phenomena are central goals in science and engineering. Cluster-based reduced-order modeling (CROM) was introduced to exploit the underlying low-dimensional dynamics of complex systems. CROM builds a data-driven discretization of the Perron-Frobenius operator, resulting in a probabilistic model for ensembles of trajectories. A key advantage of CROM is that it embeds nonlinear dynamics in a linear framework, which enables the application of standard linear techniques to the nonlinear system. CROM is typically computed on high-dimensional data; however, access to and computations on this full-state data limit the online implementation of CROM for prediction and control. Here, we address this key challenge by identifying a small subset of critical measurements to learn an efficient CROM, referred to as sparsity-enabled CROM. In particular, we leverage compressive measurements to faithfully embed the cluster geometry and preserve the probabilistic dynamics. Further, we show how to identify fewer optimized sensor locations tailored to a specific problem that outperform random measurements. Both of these sparsity-enabled sensing strategies significantly reduce the burden of data acquisition and processing for low-latency in-time estimation and control. We illustrate this unsupervised learning approach on three different high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems from fluids with increasing complexity, with one application in flow control. Sparsity-enabled CROM is a critical facilitator for real-time implementation on high-dimensional systems where full-state information may be inaccessible. (C) 2017 The Authors.

AB This work focuses mainly on the study of numerical solutions, which are obtained using the theta-method, of a generalized Warren and Root model that includes a second-order wavelike equation in its formulation. The solutions approximately describe the single-phase hydraulic head in fractures by considering the finite velocity of propagation by means of a Cattaneo-like equation. The corresponding discretized model is obtained by utilizing a non-uniform grid and a non-uniform time step. A simple relationship is proposed to give the time-step distribution. Convergence is analyzed by comparing results from explicit, fully implicit, and Crank-Nicolson schemes with exact solutions: a telegraphic model of fluid flow in a single-porosity reservoir with relaxation dynamics, the Warren and Root model, and our studied model, which is solved with the inverse Laplace transform. We find that the flux and the hydraulic head have spurious oscillations that most often appear in small-time solutions but are attenuated as the solution time progresses. Furthermore, we show that the finite difference method is unable to reproduce the exact flux at time zero. Obtaining results for oilfield production times, which are in the order of months in real units, is only feasible using parallel implicit schemes. In addition, we propose simple parallel algorithms for the memory flux and for the explicit scheme. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The fifth order WENO scheme with adaptive order is competent for solving hyperbolic conservation laws, its reconstruction is a convex combination of a fifth order linear reconstruction and three third order linear reconstructions. Note that, on uniform mesh, the computational cost of smoothness indicator for fifth order linear reconstruction is comparable with the sum of ones for three third order linear reconstructions, thus it is too heavy; on non-uniform mesh, the explicit form of smoothness indicator for fifth order linear reconstruction is difficult to be obtained, and its computational cost is much heavier than the one on uniform mesh. In order to overcome these problems, a simple smoothness indicator for fifth order linear reconstruction is proposed in this paper. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The paper develops a hybrid method for solving a system of advection-diffusion equations in a bulk domain coupled to advection-diffusion equations on an embedded surface. A monotone nonlinear finite volume method for equations posed in the bulk is combined with a trace finite element method for equations posed on the surface. In our approach, the surface is not fitted by the mesh and is allowed to cut through the background mesh in an arbitrary way. Moreover, a triangulation of the surface into regular shaped elements is not required. The background mesh is an octree grid with cubic cells. As an example of an application, we consider the modeling of contaminant transport in fractured porous media. One standard model leads to a coupled system of advection-diffusion equations in a bulk (matrix) and along a surface (fracture). A series of numerical experiments with both steady and unsteady problems and different embedded geometries illustrate the numerical properties of the hybrid approach. The method demonstrates great flexibility in handling curvilinear or branching lower dimensional embedded structures. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB High-order accurate upwind approximations for the wave equation in second-order form on overlapping grids are developed. Although upwind schemes are well established for first-order hyperbolic systems, it was only recently shown by Banks and Henshaw[1] how upwinding could be incorporated into the second-order form of the wave equation. This new upwind approach is extended here to solve the time-domain Maxwell's equations in second-order form; schemes of arbitrary order of accuracy are formulated for general curvilinear grids. Taylor time-stepping is used to develop single-step space-time schemes, and the upwind dissipation is incorporated by embedding the exact solution of a local Riemann problem into the discretization. Second-order and fourth-order accurate schemes are implemented for problems in two and three space dimensions, and overlapping grids are used to treat complex geometry and problems with multiple materials. Stability analysis of the upwind-scheme on overlapping grids is performed using normal mode theory. The stability analysis and computations confirm that the upwind scheme remains stable on overlapping grids, including the difficult case of thin boundary grids when the traditional non-dissipative scheme becomes unstable. The accuracy properties of the scheme are carefully evaluated on a series of classical scattering problems for both perfect conductors and dielectric materials in two and three space dimensions. The upwind scheme is shown to be robust and provide high-order accuracy. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We present a robust discretization of the Ericksen model of liquid crystals with variable degree of orientation coupled with colloidal effects and electric fields. The total energy consists of the Ericksen energy, a weak anchoring (or penalized Dirichlet) energy to model colloids, and an electrical energy for a given electric field. We describe our special discretization of the total energy along with a method to compute minimizers via a discrete quasi-gradient flow algorithm which has a strictly monotone energy decreasing property. Numerical experiments are given in two and three dimensions to illustrate that the method is able to capture non-trivial defect patterns, such as the Saturn ring defect. We conclude with a rigorous proof of the Gamma-convergence of our discrete energy to the continuous energy. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We present a new, high-order, control-volume-finite-element (CVFE) method for multi-phase porous media flow with discontinuous 1st-order representation for pressure and discontinuous 2nd-order representation for velocity. The method has been implemented using unstructured tetrahedral meshes to discretize space. The method locally and globally conserves mass. However, unlike conventional CVFE formulations, the method presented here does not require the use of control volumes (CVs) that span the boundaries between domains with differing material properties. We demonstrate that the approach accurately preserves discontinuous saturation changes caused by permeability variations across such boundaries, allowing efficient simulation of flow in highly heterogeneous models. Moreover, accurate solutions are obtained at significantly lower computational cost than using conventional CVFE methods. We resolve a long-standing problem associated with the use of classical CVFE methods to model flow in highly heterogeneous porous media. (C) 2017 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB We develop a general methodology for the inclusion of a variable surface tension coefficient into a Volume-of-Fluid based Navier-Stokes solver. This new numerical model provides a robust and accurate method for computing the surface gradients directly by finding the tangent directions on the interface using height functions. The implementation is applicable to both temperature and concentration dependent surface tension coefficient, along with the setups involving a large jump in the temperature between the fluid and its surrounding, as well as the situations where the concentration should be strictly confined to the fluid domain, such as the mixing of fluids with different surface tension coefficients. We demonstrate the applicability of our method to the thermocapillary migration of bubbles and the coalescence of drops characterized by a different surface tension coefficient.

AB Calcium copper titanium oxide (CaCu3Ti4O12, CCTO) films of 400 nm thickness were deposited on ITO and FTO substrates by radio-frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering at different deposition temperatures (100, 150, 200, and 250 degrees C). The influences of deposition temperatures and substrates on the structural, morphological, and optical properties of CCTO films were systematically investigated by XRD, AFM and UV-visible spectrophotometer. XRD study showed that all the CCTO films have a cubic structure. As the deposition temperature increased to 250 degrees C, the film crystallinity was improved, the crystallite sizes became larger and the films deposited on FTO substrates exhibited better crystalline quality. AFM studies revealed that the surface roughness of the films was increased with increasing deposition temperatures for both substrates. The transmittance spectra of the films were more than 50% transparent in the visible region (500-900 nm). It was also observed that the optical transmittance and energy band gaps reduced with increased deposition temperatures for both substrates. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The hierarchical carpet-like WO3 microflowers were synthesized via a facile one-step hydrothermal method by using oleic acid as a oriented growth reagent. The as-synthesized WO3 microflowers show a triclinic crystal structure and are basically hierarchical assemblies of carpet-like nanosheets made up of the subunit of bundle-like nanowires. Based on the morphology evolution process, a possible crystal growth and nanostructure assembling mechanism were proposed. The prepared WO3 microflower sensor exhibits a gas sensing response of about 228 when exposed to 10 ppm of toxic NO2 gas at 200 degrees C. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB A series of novel beta-NaYF4: Ce,Tb crystals were prepared by hydrothermal synthesis with different Ce doping concentrations. Ce doping modifies the growth process. The mean size of crystals was 230 nm-1820 nm with a hexagonal rods shape. With an increase of the Ce doping concentrations, the ratio of H/D (Height/Diameter) is continuously decreased from 4.4 to 2.2. Optical properties are determined by Tb concentration.

AB CdTe/Carbon nanotube (CNTs)/ZnO flower-like microspheres were successfully synthesized by a simple hot bath method and their physicochemical properties were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). The flower-like microspheres were formed with nanosheets of a 3-4 mu m diameter, and they showed a 98% degradation rate of rhodamine B (Rh B) under UV light irradiation in only 30 min versus 60 min for pure ZnO. The results strongly suggested that the photocatalytic activity of ZnO could be obviously enhanced by compositing with CdTe and CNTs. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Nanomedicine utilizes biocompatible nanomaterials for therapeutic purposes to treat various diseases. Flavonoids present in the plant materials act as both reducing and electrostatic stabilizing agents for the 'Green' synthesis of metal nanomaterials. Further, these nanomaterials are effectively used to treat various cancer cells and pathogenic microbes. The experimental approach for flavonoids-mediated nano-material (FMN) synthesis is simple, rapid, cost-effective and reproducible. However, the detailed reports on synthesis, mechanism, and in vivo application of FMN are very limited in literatures. Thus, this focused review will definitely help researchers who are working on biocompatible nanomaterial synthesis and application in biomedical sector. Further, this is the first review to discuss the significance, mechanisms, and future trends of FMN. The FMN and their dual function as both nano-carrier and nano-drug in various biomedical sectors might be a hot research topic in upcoming days. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Uniform crystalline Cu2O truncated octahedra constructed by 8 hexagonal {1 1 1} surfaces and 6 square {1 0 0} surfaces were quickly synthesized in high yield with glucose served as an environmental-friendly reducing reagent, and no template or surfactant was employed during the synthetic procedure. With reaction time prolonging, the {1 0 0} surfaces were selectively etched with a hole on each facet, and the hole would become bigger to form surface pits finally. The X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterizations indicated that these Cu2O truncated octahedral possessed cubic phase with very high phase purity. This simple one-pot synthetic route could provide a good starting point for the research of shape-dependent catalytic properties of other materials. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The morphology and crystal structure of SmOCl remain unchanged after combined with AgCl. The photocatalytic activity of the AgCl/ SmOCl composites was evaluated by the degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) solution under simulate sunlight. Compared with the SmOCl samples, the AgCl/ SmOCl composites remarkably exhibited enhanced (about 16-fold) photocatalytic activity in the decomposition of Rhodamine B. After 40 min of simulate sunlight irradiation 95% of RhB was decomposed. The enhanced AgCl/ SmOCl performance was contributed to the new Z-scheme structure. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB In present paper, a promising intermediate band (IB) material of CuGaS2 thin films incorporating with titanium (Ti) have been successfully fabricated by a facile non-vacuum method. Binary sulfides used as raw material are firstly tried to fabricate Ti-substituted CuGaS2 thin films via ball milling and spin-coating technique. The experimental measurements showed that the obtained Cu2Ga1-xTixS2 thin films are composed of chalcopyrite structure with well crystallinity. A slightly left shift of (1 1 2) diffraction peaks indicated the successful doping of Ti element. The Hall Effect measurement exhibited the carrier concentration raised obviously from 1.538 x 10(12) (x = 0) to 1.134 x 10(13) cm(-3) (x = 0.06) with increasing of Ti doping concentration. More important, the UV-vis-NIR spectra exhibited a strong optical absorption in Ti-substituted CuGaS2 films, which indicated the IBs were roughly formed in the films.

AB The phenomenon of metallic grain ejection is for the first time explained. An evaluation of ejected grains was performed in Cu-Al-Ni shape memory alloy load-free cycled up to 500 times within the temperature interval of reversible martensitic transformation (RMT). An intergranular fracture mechanism related to RMT is proposed to this phenomenon. By image processing, 8 grains/cm(2) after 500 cycles were measured. This is attributed to gamma'(1) martensite transformation at the grain boundaries. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The isothermal compression of a Ti-43.5Al-8 Nb-0.2 W-0.2 B (at.%) alloy with (alpha(2) + gamma) microstructure has been examined at temperature range of 950-1050 degrees C under strain rate range of 10(-2)-10(-5) s(-1). The results showed that the value of m (strain rate sensitivity factor) increased from 0.18 through 0.33 to 0.48 with decreasing diffusion compensated strain rates. This indicates a transition of deformation mechanism from dislocation creep to grain boundary sliding (GBS), which was observed in the microstructure characterization. The transition took place over about one and a half orders of magnitude in diffusion-compensated strain rate may also be predicted by employing unified rate constitutive equations for dislocation creep and GBS in an additive manner.

AB A novel intermediate band (IB) material of Zn incorporation in Ti-doped CuGaS2 thin films has been successfully fabricated via a facile non vacuum method including ball milling, spin-coating and annealing. Experimental results have shown that the IB position of Ti-doped CuGaS2 thin films can be adjusted by Zn incorporation. In this study, the optical band gap has a shortening of 0.19 eV when 0.6% Zn is added to the 1.5% Ti-doped CuGaS2. Due to the Zn addition, the grains grow larger, which is observable from the surface morphology of the thin films using scanning electron microscope (SEM). The energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX) spectrum demonstrates that ball milling can effectively make Ti and Zn elements co-coped evenly into CuGaS2 thin films. Moreover, the improved optical property of the Ti-doped CuGaS2 thin films due to the Zn incorporation also sheds lights in developing new material that could be a potential light absorption layers candidate of high efficiency solar cells.

AB Spontaneous superlattice ordering has been observed in AlxGa1-xAs layers grown on (1 0 0) GaAs substrates by metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy. Transmission electron microscopic image clearly revealed superlattice structures and the selected area electron diffraction showed closely spaced superlattice spots around the main diffraction pattern. High resolution X-ray diffraction showed distinct and sharp superlattice peaks symmetrically positioned around the central (0 0 4) Bragg peak and the similar measurement for (0 0 2) planes, which is quasi-forbidden for Bragg reflections showed only superlattice peaks. A superlattice period of 5.35 nm was calculated with periodic Al variation in the two layers of the superlattice. Thermal annealing studies showed the superlattice structure was stable up to 800 degrees C and disappeared after annealing at 900 degrees C retaining the crystallinity of the epilayer. Photoluminescence at 4 K showed a distinct peak at 1.732 eV with full width at half maximum of 8 meV corresponding to the bandgap related excitonic transition for an average Al composition x = 0.17. A blue shift of 32 meV of the bandgap related excitonic peak for the 900 degrees C annealed sample is attributed to the loss of the superlattice ordering with the same average composition of the epilayer.

AB Using the reactive magnetron co-sputtering process TiN-AuN2 nanocomposite films were formed on IN718 (a Ni-based superalloy) substrates. Substrate temperature and deposition time strongly influenced crystallization, orientation, hardness and elastic modulus of the nanocomposite films. The films deposited at room temperature are amorphous while those deposited at 250 degrees C are nano-crystalline. The formation of the nanocomposite is confirmed by the SAED patterns which show the presence of both TiN and AuN2 phases. The hardness of the nanocomposite is in the range 4-6 GPa while the elastic modulus ranges from 55 to 100 GPa. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A new low temperature co-fired ceramic is fabricated from B2O3-La2O3-MgO-TiO2 (BLMT) glass with ZnO, ZrO2 and TiO2 ternary fillers, and the sintering behavior, crystalline phases, microstructures and microwave dielectric properties of the glass-ceramics is investigated. The results show that its sintering process starts at about 640 degrees C and ends up mostly at higher than 710 degrees C. During the process, BLMT glass crystallizes forming LaBO3 and the filler ZnO reacts with and gets into the residue glass phase, while TiO2 and ZrO2 are stable. With increasing sintering temperature, dielectric constant and temperature coefficient of resonant frequency of the glass-ceramic decrease, while the quality factor firstly increases and then decreases. Typically, the glass-ceramic sintered at 860 degrees C for 20 min reaches a maximum density of 4.25 g/cm(3) and has an excellent microwave dielectric properties with the dielectric constant of 14.08, quality factor of 41,600 GHz (at 8 GHz), and temperature coefficient of resonant frequency of -2.78 ppm/degrees C.

AB In this work, nano-structured Mn3O4 particles with spongy-morphology were synthesized through vesicle templating, where hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) were used as cationic-anionic surfactants. The Mn3O4 electrode materials exhibited a high specific capacitance (451 F g(-1)) at a current density of 0.5 A g(-1) in 1 mol L-1 Na2SO4 electrolyte, and retained 333 F g(-1) when the current density was increased to 5 A g(-1). Its capacitance retention is also high (up to 92%) after 10,000 cycles at a current density of 5 A g(-1). (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Graphene oxide (GO) sheets were synthesized via a modified Hummer's method. Subsequently, annualring shaped graphene hydrogel was formed through alkali-inducing hydrothermal process. The lyophilized GO hydrogel was tailored to a cylindrical emitter and demonstrated good field emission performance: maximum current density reached 2.32 mA/cm(2), field enhanced factor of 1969 and turn-on electric field at 2.41 V/mu m, accompanied with excellent stability. Moreover, the emitter also exhibited superior mechanical properties, such as ultra-light, flexibility and free-standing. These results suggest that the resultant with unique structure has a potential to be utilized as a high-performance field emitter. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In the present work, dissolved cellulose has been 3D bioprinted to produce complex structures with ordered interconnected pores. The process consists of the dissolution of dissolving pulps in N-methylmorpholine- N-oxide (NMMO), multilayered dispensing, water removal of NMMO and freezedrying. 3D bioprinting of cellulose/NMMO solution at 70 degrees C was analogous to that of thermoplastics by the process of melting and solidification to produce cellulose/NMMO objects in the solid form. However, 3D bioprinting of cellulose/NMMO solution at a higher temperature than 70 degrees C produced cellulose/NMMO objects in the gel form. Cellulose was regenerated by water; thereafter, freeze-drying treatment maintained the 3D bioprinted structures without collapsing. The final cellulose products had remarkable Young's compressive modulus (12.9 MPa) and tensile modulus (160.6 MPa). This work demonstrated the feasibility of cellulose as an alternative in the 3D printing industry to the production of complex structures. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this hierarchical design, flexible carbon fabric is coated with interlinked Mn3O4 nanosheets, which produces a highly porous reticular oxide/hydroxide/carbon composite structure. The flexible supercapacitors electrode of unique architecture exhibits an excellent specific capacitance of 941 F g(-1) at a current density of 1mA cm(-2), with the advantages of light weight, and long-term cycling stability by retaining 89.7% after 5000 charge-discharge cycles at a constant current density of 5 mA cm(-2).

AB To control the dielectric loss of polymer/carbon nanotube (CNT) composites, we developed coaxial double-layer coated CNTs to form a diminishing conductive gradient from the CNT center to its outside through a dual-functional polyaniline (PANI) interlayer. The conductive multiwalled CNTs were covered with a semiconductive PANI first shell through in situ redox polymerization with ferric chloride as the oxidizing agent; moreover, this agent is the precursor of the second iron hydroxide shell. The inorganic outer layer of iron hydroxides was directly coated on the PANI interlayer surface through in situ deposition method to obtain an insulating property. Depending on the conductivity that decreases from the inside to the outside of the core-shell structured CNT hybrids, the epoxy resin-based composites showed gradually reduced dielectric losses because the double-coating layers hindered the reunion and connection of conductive CNTs.

AB The ultimate goal in the preparation of composite materials, which is difficult to achieve, is the uniform dispersion of fillers within a polymer matrix to form an interconnected network. Herein, we prepared novel polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) composites loaded with three-dimensional (3D) continuous silica fibers (i.e., silica sponge). In the composites, silica fibers maintained continuous fibrous structure, achieved uniform distribution, and showed strong interfacial adhesion with PDMS, which together contributed to a dramatic improvement in mechanical properties compared with pure PDMS and PDMS loaded with glass fibers. With a loading level of only 1 wt%, the tensile modulus, strength, strain-atbreak, and tear strength of the composites improved by 140%, 94%, 18%, and 95%, respectively, compared to PDMS. In addition, these composites retained good transparency. More importantly, this silica fiber filler system is widely applicable and can be used to prepare various high performance polymer composites. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Phosphate glass matrix nanocomposites containing trisilanolphenyl polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) were investigated for the first time to accelerate efforts to develop novel hybrid phosphate glass/POSS composites with enhanced benefits. Tin fluorophosphate glass (Pglass) having ultra-low glass transition temperature (T-g) was utilized as the matrix material in extrusion at relatively low processing temperature (i.e., 270 +/- 10 degrees C) compared to that of typical borosilicate and sodalime glasses. The resulting nanocomposites materials were highly porous due to evaporation of condensed water produced in situ from polysiloxane condensation reaction between the Pglass and POSS during the extrusion process. As the amount of POSS was increased in the Pglass matrix material, the glass transition temperature was significantly changed by the bulky POSS molecules. The novel porous nanocomposites should find a number of uses in applications at elevated temperatures where conventional organic polymer foam materials are not useable. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB The CoZn alloy nanowires have been fabricated by direct current electrodeposition technique with confined nanochannels of porous anodized aluminum oxide as template. The applied voltage was set in the range from -1.2 V to -1.4 V to adjust the Co/Zn ratios in CoZn alloy nanowires. Electron microscope images show that the as-prepared CoZn alloy nanowires are regular and uniform with an average diameter of 50 nm, which coincides with the size of the used template. The influence of applied voltage on the morphology and structure of CoZn alloy nanowires is systematically studied. The surface of the CoZn alloy nanowires changes from smooth to rather rough with increasing applied voltage from -1.2 V to -1.4 V. Besides that, the Co/Zn ratio of the as-prepared CoZn alloy nanowires has a nonlinear increment relation with increasing applied voltage. X-ray diffraction results reveal that the structure of the CoZn alloy nanowires change from the amorphous to hcp crystalline phase with increasing applied voltage from -1.2 V to -1.4 V.

AB In this work, a novel understanding was proposed to explain bonding process of a cold sprayed Cu particle deposition. The cleaning effect by the extrusion of viscous metal jet was proved for the first time by the observation of oxides fragments located at the periphery of detached particle, which promoted the formation of metallurgical bonding around central area. It is more interests to find the existence of micro-cracks on contact interface, which revealed the clue of interfacial melting. However, the lack of dimple-like fractures suggests that the interfacial melting at the contact interface is not a prerequisite for metallurgical bonding. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB A series of B-type carbonated apatites with varying carbonate levels were synthesized in order to analyze how synthetic materials and natural bone structure change with carbonate contents. FT-IR, Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction have been employed as combined tools to study the structural change of synthetic carbonated apatite and nature bone mineral. B-type carbonated apatites have been extensively investigated because they resemble most closely of mineral phase of nature bone. In this study, we found that hydroxyl ions in the apatite lattice are reduced as the carbonate contents increase. These results demonstrate that the substitution of tetrahedron phosphate ions by planar carbonate ions causes the structural deficiency of hydroxyl ions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Semiconductor Quantum dots (QD) has gained substantial interest in biological applications during the past decades. ZnO QDs do not include heavy metal ions, are favorable in some applications. However, ZnO QDs obtained via classic sol-gel route are unstable in water and are lack of functional groups that could be conjugated with bioactive molecules. In this paper, ZnO quantum dots (QDs) were synthesized using Zinc methacrylate as starting material. Zinc methacrylate, N-Isopropylacrylamide, N-tert-butyl acrylamide and (N-(3-aminopropyl) methacrylamide hydrochloride were copolymerized and refluxed within alkaline ethanol solution; ZnO@polymer QDs were generated in situ. Composition and photoluminescence of the obtained QDs were investigated. The QDs were utilized for labeling of bacteria E. coli. Results indicate that the emission wavelengths of the QDs were tuned in the scope of 440-482 nm; the photoluminescence of the QDs was stable in water for 15 days, ZnO composition in the QD is 7.25%, size of the QDs were in the range of 2.5-4 nm, and the QDs have binding ability to E. coli.

DE Thin-film; Oxide photovoltaics; XPS; Energy-band offset
AB BaBiO3 is presented as a potential absorber for all-oxide solar cells. Thin-films of BaBiO3 were deposited by pulsed laser deposition. As-deposited thin-films were amorphous, but a rapid thermal anneal at 600 degrees C for 10 min yields polycrystalline thin-films. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements show that deposited films have Barium in Ba-12 state and bismuth in both Bi-13 and Bi-15 state. UV-Vis spectrophotometer (UV-Vis) shows that BaBiO3 films have direct and indirect bandgap (E-g) of 2.25 eV and 2.02 eV respectively, while ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) shows that valence band maxima (E-V), conduction band minima (E-C) and work-function (phi) of BaBiO3 is at 5.82 eV, 3.8 eV and 4.22 eV respectively. BaBiO3 thin-film devices with a FTO/c-TiO2/BaBiO3/Au structure show rectifying current-voltage characteristics in dark. Under illumination, a photo response with a J(light)/J(dark) ratio of 1.75 is observed. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Ex-situ XRD patterns show that the layered structure remained when discharged to 1.2 V and the phase of Li2O and transition metal (Ni, Mn and Co) emerged when discharged to 0.05 V, indicating that there exists conversion reaction mechanism like transition-metal oxides anode material. The reversible capacities reach 574.2 and 449.8 mAh g(-1) at the current density of 50 mA g(-1) and 200 mA g(-1) respectively after 80 cycles.

AB Molecular dynamic simulation was used to study the brittle versus ductile fracture behaviour in nanotwinned Ni at various temperatures. The simulation results show that three temperature regimes correspond to three different fracture behaviours: brittle, brittle-to-ductile transition and ductile. A dual fracture transition mechanism in nanotwinned Ni within a small temperature interval was observed: (1) local phase transformation and (2) ledge formation ahead of the crack tip induced a sharp fracture transition from brittle mode to ductile mode. Our simulation results reveal that the very rare double fracture transition mechanisms could be transformed quickly in nanotwinned Ni within a narrow temperature interval, suggesting a new interpretation of fracture and deformation of nanotwinned Face Centred Cubic metals.

AB The paper presents a facile and effective method to fabricate the new type MoS2 with expanded interlayer spacing (similar to 9.70 angstrom) and high-density edges in the presence of graphene oxide (GO) and surfactant. The abundant oxygen-containing groups on GO surfaces can provide nucleation sites through electrostatic interaction with the assistance of surfactant to promote heterogeneous nucleation of MoS2 on GO surfaces. During reaction, GO was reduced to graphene (rGO) by eliminating the oxygen-containing groups. The nonwettability between MoS2 and rGO compels the growing MoS2 nanosheets to stretch out of the rGO surfaces, leading to the high-density edges. Besides, the excess surfactant can insert the interlayer of MoS2, causing the enlarged interlayer spacing. The obtained MoS2 could exhibit improved catalytic activity and the synthetic approach presented here may be extended to grow other transition metal dichalcogenide materials. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

ID GA SINGLE-CRYSTALS
AB Stress-strain loops illustrating the superelastic behaviour of shape memory alloys (SMAs) were computed based on the theory of ferroelastic phase transitions. The predictions of the theory demonstrate the possibility of drastic changes in the stress-strain dependences due to the expansion of the SMA upon heating. Specifically, the computations were carried out taking into account the characteristics of Co-Ni-Ga alloys, which exhibit a high-temperature superelasticity. It is shown that the expansion of crystal lattice, which can be caused by the appearance of small particles and crystal defects, or change of chemical order in SMA, can induce (i) an extension of the temperature range of superelastic behaviour of SMA to high temperatures; (ii) an increase of the superelastic strain at elevated temperatures; (iii) an increase of the stress needed to reach the superelastic strain plateau and (iv) a widening of the hysteresis of stress-induced martensitic transformation. Theoretical results are in a qualitative agreement with experimental data obtained for Co-Ni-Ga alloys. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A unique heteronetwork consisting of crystalline tin-doped zinc oxide nanorod arrays and rutile tin oxide nanowires (SZO/SnO2) was fabricated for the first time using a two-step solution immersion method at a low temperature and immersion time (2 h) for humidity sensing applications. The average diameter and thickness of the SZO are approximately 95 and 730 nm, respectively. The diameter of the SnO2 nanowires ranges from 60 nm to 120 nm, and the length of the nanowire is approximately 10 mu m. The SZO/SnO2-based humidity sensor exhibits high stability and superior humidity sensing performance compared with the SZO-, SnO2-, and ZnO/SnO2-based sensors with a sensitivity of 67.8. Results demonstrate that the unique architecture of SZO/SnO2 heteronetwork can enhance the humidity sensing capabilities of the nanowires. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB For the first time, the influence of fine variation of pH value of the chemical bath (6.5, 7.0 and 7.5) on structure, morphology, optical and photoresponse of SnS films was investigated. X-ray analysis revealed that the structure undergoes orthorhombic-to-cubic phase transformation at pH 7.0. Furthermore, a significant reduction in dark current value of photodetector, from mA to nA, occurred following this phase transformation. Under illumination of near infrared 750 nm, the photoresponse exhibited by the photodetector based on cubic structure was found to be faster 8 times compared to that based on orthorhombic structure, while the photosensitivity was 2.7 times higher. The estimated band gap energy of films lies between 1.51 and 1.73 eV with increasing pH value. The obtained results demonstrated the crucial role of fine pH value on the characteristics of nanostructured SnS films. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The role of the mold in electrochemical migration (ECM) of printed circuit board (PCB) under DC bias was investigated using environment scanning electron microscope, 3D stereology microscopy, and scanning Kelvin probe. The mold under electrical bias can grow well and complete with the processes of growth, metabolism and proliferation. The mold can also promote metal ionization and localized corrosion and provide the ion source for ECM process. The cooperation of mold and DC bias promote ECM process on PCB and aggravate short circuit failure behavior. The proposed ECM mechanisms explain the ECM process of PCB under mold and DC bias environment. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The results show that high compositional homogeneity of precipitate was obtained, which contributed to the low crystallization temperature and thus high surface area. The resulting La0.6Sr0.4MnO3 exhibited higher activity than those prepared by other traditional methods for methane oxidation, which could be ascribed to the low apparent activation energy originated from high surface area.

The abnormal dielectric peaks could be ascribed to the contribution of doubly-ionized oxygen vacancies at high temperature range. In addition, the GP phenomenon of CdCTO ceramics were attributed to the internal barrier layer capacitor (IBLC) theory. The results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) indicated the mixed valence states of Cu+/Cu2+ and Ti3+/Ti4+ of samples. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID NEGATIVE PERMITTIVITY; NANOCOMPOSITES; PERMEABILITY
AB Negative permittivity is an exceptional property of metamaterials, which makes them unique class of artificial materials with numerous applications ranging from cloaking to wave filters. In this paper we report about the PDMS (Polydimethylsiloxane)-MWcnt (Multi wall carbon nano tube) composite beyond percolation, as a metamaterial with high negative permittivity. Percolated composite showed high negative permittivity of -2376.62 at 2541.401 Hz and low tangent loss of -0.065 at 1 MHz. The conductivity spectra followed Jonscher's power law, indicating hopping conduction for composites below percolation threshold. Beyond percolation, networking between the MWcnts formed large number of conductive paths resulting in free electron conduction. The impedance studies showed the capacitive-inductive transition in the percolated composite with inductive phase exhibiting negative permittivity. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Hexagonal-MoO3/polypyrrole conductive hybrid is facilely prepared by wrapping a homogenous polypyrrole (PPy) layer around hexagonal-MoO3 (h-MoO3) prism via in-situ oxidative polymerization of self-assembled pyrrole monomer. The electrochemical performance of the obtained h-MoO3/PPy hybrid in different electrolytes is investigated. The cyclic voltammogram results at different scan rates show that the rate behaviors of h-MoO3/PPy in the three electrolytes improve in the order of Li2SO4 < Na2SO4 < K2SO4. The EIS measurement indicates that the h-MoO3/PPy hybrid in K2SO4 electrolyte exhibits lower charge-transfer resistance and equivalent series resistance, which attributes to the small hydrated ionic radius and fast transfer rate of K+. Furthermore, the cycling stability of the h-MoO3/PPy hybrid also increase in the sequence of Li2SO4 < Na2SO4 < K2SO4. The above results provide valuable supporting information to explore new hybrid supercapacitor system. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB N-doped Ni/C/TiO2 nanocomposite is introduced as an effective photocatalyst for water splitting under visible light radiation. The proposed photocatalyst contains most of the effective co-catalysts enhancing the photocatalytic activity of the titanium oxide. The nanocomposite was prepared by sintering a vacuously dried sol-gel composed of polyvinylpyrrolidone, titanium isopropoxide and nickel acetate under nitrogen atmosphere at 700 degrees C for 3 h. TEM, XRD and XPS analyses confirmed that the introduced catalyst is N-doped & TiO2-incorporated amorphous carbon sheets decorated by Ni nanoparticles. The introduced nanocomposite revealed distinct performance as photocatalyst toward water splitting reaction, numerically the generated hydrogen was 0.383 mmol. sec(-1). g(cat)(1); 8.6 ml.sec(-1). g(cat).(1) However, nickel content somewhat influences the catalytic performance; 15 wt% reveals the best performance.

AB Micromechanics mechanism of two alpha-Fe models with and without a/2 < 1 1 1 >{1 1 0} edge dislocations is investigated under a constant strain rate of 10(9) s(-1) at 800 K with 0.1 at.% He by molecular dynamics simulations. The results show that micromechanics behaviors are tailored by pressure release of He clusters and subsequent He bubbles coalescence. Furthermore, it is interested to notice that yield stress and strain of the model with dislocations is 0.06 and 10.52 GPa, which is lower than that of the model without dislocations (0.105 and 11.77 GPa), respectively. The reason for the acceleration is attributed to the consolidation of positive and negative edge dislocations, which induces the nucleation and growth of larger He bubbles. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB ZnO/Si hetero-structured nanotrees have been fabricated by an all-solution-based hydrothermal process. First, urchin-shaped ZnO nanostructures were grown on ZnO-island seed layers by selective growth of ZnO nanorod bundles. In the hydrothermal solution, NH4OH supplied OH- source for ZnO growth to maintain the urchin-shaped ZnO nanostructures and etched the exposed Si surfaces simultaneously. The urchin-shaped ZnO nanostructures acted as a mask for undercut etching of the exposed Si surfaces. The Si {1 1 1} surfaces with the lowest surface energy were exposed and formed pyramid-shaped stems for the nanotrees during the etching. The final ZnO/Si hetero-structured nanotrees consisted of ZnO nanorod branches and pyramidal Si stems. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To evaluate surface morphology characteristics, the histogram and power spectral density analyses of atomic force microscopy data were extracted from two different morphologies of nickel films. Results showed that boric acid plays an important role in the control of nucleation and the growth of micro-nanostructures. With clear observation of growth steps in atomic force microscopy characterization, terrace width and spiral growth proved the existence of screw dislocation growth. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The as-synthesized SnO2 products are characterized through X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and specific surface area analyzer. Simultaneously, the as-synthesized products are studied for degradation of several organic dyes and removal of heavy metal ions (Fe3+ and Ni2+). The results show the as-synthesized SnO2 products possess excellent photocatalytic activities and good removal abilities to Fe3+ and Ni2+, which could be attributed to large specific surface area and unique structure of the as-synthesized SnO2 products. It demonstrates that the as-synthesized SnO2 nanosheets possess potential applications in wastewater purification. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB It's meaningful to design and fabricate novel high-performance carbon anode materials for lithium ion batteries (LIBs). Herein, 3-aminophenol-formaldehyde resin/silica nanorods were synthesized via a sol-gel transcription method, using cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide as the template and pentanol as co-structure directing agent. After carbonization at 600 degrees C and removal of silica, carbonaceous nanorods with N content of 7.87 wt% and specific surface area of 551.3 m(2) g(-1) were obtained. They showed a stable discharge capacity of 696.7 mAh g(-1) after 400 cycles. Carbonaceous nanorods (comprising 9.6 wt% b-SiC) with N content of 1.22 wt% and specific surface area of 1079.1 m(2) g(-1) were also obtained at 1400 degrees C. They showed a stable discharge capacity of 457.9 mAh g(-1) after 400 cycles. The results prove that the synthesized N-doped carbonaceous nanorods are good anode candidates for LIBs.

AB Reducing production cost by minimizing growth steps of ZnO microstructures is an important key for large scale fabrication of optoelectronic devices. Here, we present the growth of submicron ZnO arrays on FTO substrates by only one step without seed layers using hydrothermal method. The effect of KOH mass concentration on the physical properties of ZnO submicron rods has been investigated employing Uv-vis spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy. The results indicate the formation of hexagonal structure of ZnO submicron arrays with different surface morphology, different orientations and diameters dependent on KOH concentration. Uniform ZnO submicron rod arrays with (0 0 2) preferred orientation were obtained when the KOH concentration was 0.24 g/ml. Beside the uniformity and good alignment of ZnO arrays along the c-axis of FTO substrate, they have the smallest diameter which make them suitable to photo-electronic applications.

AB With the revision of the South African food-based dietary guidelines (FBDGs) a new guideline specifically recommending the daily consumption of dairy products including maas (cultured milk) was introduced. This paper aims to evaluate the relevance of including maas as a traditional food product in the FBDGs. It was found that maas is a culturally relevant and traditional food product in South Africa. The nutrient profile of maas has changed notably over time since the first nutrient analysis was performed in 1995. The health benefits of maas, together with its popularity and its cultural relevance as part of the South African diet, make maas a suitable traditional food product to be included in the South African FBDGs.

AB Diabetes, a chronic hyperglycemic disorder, is a public health concern in India. High glycemic carbohydrate foods are linked to higher risk of diabetes. The chemical composition and in vivo glycemic potential of popular Indian rice varieties namely Jaya, Lalat, NDR-97, PR-113, Salivahana, Sasyasree, Savithri, Tellahamsa, Triguna, Varalu and one hybrid DRRH-3, having wide agronomical and grain morphological features were studied. Nutrient composition varied prominently among different varieties. Resistant starch (RS) content (2.03-2.91%) correlated negatively with the glycemic index (GI) (r = -0.674; p <= 0.05) and contributed for 45.5% of GI variability. Lalat, an aromatic traditional rice variety, with 2.91% RS and 27.9% amylose was the only one eliciting low GI of 50 and glycemic load (GL) of 13 while the rest exhibited GI ranging from 70 by Savitri to 80 by Salivahana. Identification of Lalat as a low GI variety is of significance in the dietary prevention and management of diabetes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a Guideline for calculating nutrient content of foods by calculation methods for food business operators and presents data on compliance between calculated values and analytically determined values. In the EU, calculation methods are legally valid to determine the nutrient values of foods for nutrition labelling (Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011). However, neither a specific calculation method nor rules for use of retention factors are defined. EuroFIR AISBL (European Food Information Resource) has introduced a Recipe Calculation Guideline based on the EuroFIR harmonized procedure for recipe calculation. The aim is to provide food businesses with a step-by-step tool for calculating nutrient content of foods for the purpose of nutrition declaration. The development of this Guideline and use in the Czech Republic is described and future application to other Member States is discussed. Limitations of calculation methods and the importance of high quality food composition data are discussed. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Andean potatoes (Solanum tuberosum andigenum) are a staple food for Andean population; there is great biodiversity but only few varieties are cultivated nowadays. In order to contribute to biodiversity conservation of Andean potatoes, information about their morphological, nutritional and functional characteristics was generated. In gene bank (INTA-Balcarce), varieties collected from regional producers were preserved. Forty-four genotypes were multiplied and characterized. Morphological characteristics; proximate composition and functional compounds were analyzed. Cluster analysis separated them into 3 groups according to distinguishing characteristics, which define industrial or nutritional applications. Group 2 was characterized by higher content of macronutrients and Group 3 with the highest antioxidant activity, both would be advisable for direct consumption. Genotype CS 1418 had big size and oval form so it could be destined to potato chips industry. Knowledge on nutritional and functional properties of genotypes contributes to promoting the cultivation depending on properties and also to preserve biodiversity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The world hottest Naga king chilli is cultivated and consumed in Northeast India. Capsaicinoids, amino acids and fatty acids were studied in fruit and fruit components of Naga king chilli. Capsaicinoid content was increased in each ripening stage and maximum level was observed at red color fruits. Total protein and fat content of placenta was 19.41 and 20.36% respectively. Capsaicinoids of placenta (7.35 +/- 2.241%) was higher followed by seed (3.83 +/- 1.358%) and pericarp (2.91 +/- 0.667%). Similarly, essential amino acid content was also higher in placenta compared to other components. Amino acid score ranged from 37 to 38 with cystine and methionine as limiting amino acid. Low level of palmitic, stearic and alpha-linolenic acid and very high level of linoleic acid were found in seeds. Total polyunsaturates of seeds were higher followed by whole fruit. Naga king chilli is unique due to its high capsaicinoid content and it offers potential crop for the future exploitation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The chemical compositions and antioxidant capacities of seven spices consumed in Southern Nigeria were determined. They were purchased from majors markets in the study area. Edible portions of the spices were ground into fine powder and their nutrient and phytochemical compositions determined using standard methods. Antioxidant activity were determined on aqueous extract using standard assays, namely, 1,1-diphenyl-2picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical ability and ferric reducing antioxidant potential (FRAP). The spices were rich in macro-and micro-nutrients. Ricinodendron heudelotii had the highest protein (30.6%) and fat (24.6%) contents. Tetrapleura tetraptera had the least fat content. The total phenol, flavonoid and vitamin C contents differed significantly (p < 0.001) from each other. Aframomum citratum had the highest amount of total phenol, flavonoid and DPPH scavenging ability, while Afrostyrax lepidophyllus had the best FRAP. The spices have good nutrient profile and antioxidant potentials. Their increased consumption is recommended and use as functional foods needs to be exploited. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB One hundred recipes of waterleaf and wild spinach soup (afang) consumed among the Ibibios in Southsouth Nigeria were collected through interview and questionnaire from indigenous homemakers and food sellers, harmonized, standardized, prepared and their nutrient content calculated. Mean weights of ingredients were calculated to obtain the control recipe. Major ingredients in the soup were analyzed chemically. Edible portions, retention factors to be applied in recipe calculation were determined. Sensory evaluation was conducted on five of the most preferred recipes on a nine- point hedonic scale. Edible coefficients of major foods ranged between 0.32 and 0.95. Significant changes (p < 0.05) in nutrients were observed between raw and cooked ingredients and recipes. Afang soup had 67.9% moisture; protein, 12.7% and energy, 169 kcal. Fat contributed 57% of the total energy. Consumption of adequate quantities of afang soup will contribute substantially to Recommended Nutrient Intake of protein and micronutrients which will further increase with additional fish/meat.

AB Nutritional adequacy depends on nutrient intakes and bioavailability which strongly varies with the plant- or animal-origin of foods. The aim was to estimate iron, zinc, protein and vitamin A bioavailability from individual diets, and investigate its relation with the animal-to-plant ratio (A/P) of diets. Bioavailability was estimated in 1899 French diets using diet-based algorithms or food-group specific conversion factors. Nutrient inadequacy was estimated based on i) bioavailability calculated in each individual diet and ii) average bioavailability assumed for Western- diets. Mean iron absorption, zinc absorption, protein quality and b-carotene conversion factor were 13%, 30%, 92%, and 17: 1, respectively. Bioavailability displayed a high variability between individual diets, poorly explained by their A/P. Using individual bioavailability led to different inadequacy prevalence than with average factors assumed for Western- diets. In this population, the A/P does not seem sufficient to predict nutrient bioavailability and the corresponding recommended intakes. Nutritional adequacy should be assessed using bioavailability accounting for individual diets composition. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Protein and fat content of cookies were ranged from 5.89 +/- 0.04 to 8.27 +/- 0.21% and 21.03 +/- 0.01 to 23.08 +/- 0.03% respectively. The starch content of cookie ranged between 47.06 +/- 0.01 and 42.15 +/- 0.03% and dietary fiber was reported highest in CSH14 (9.27 +/- 0.01%). The highest Mg (56.24 +/- 0.03 mg/100 g) P (255.54 +/- 0.03 mg/100 g), and K (124.26 +/- 0.02 mg/100 g) content were found in C43 cultivar. CSV18R was reported highest iron content (1.23 +/- 0.01 mg/100 g). The sensory scores for overall acceptability of cookies were highest in CSH23, CSH13R and CSV18R cultivars which are rich in dietary fiber and minerals. Normally the hybrids are high yielders and the grain price/qt is 20% lower than varieties. It is implied the raw material costs of two identified cultivars (CSH23 & CSH13R) would help the industry to reduce overall cost of production and offer a better profit margins over the varieties.

AB Most governments have committed to the set of Sustainable Development Goals established by the United Nations (UN) to be achieved by 2030. Subsequently the governments have drafted, or are in process of drafting, policies and programmes which aim to answer to these global requests. South Africa provides a unique case study: despite economic growth, undernutrition has not improved when compared to other industrialised nations, while at the same time, diet-related non-communicable diseases and obesity have exponentially increased. Access to healthy food is a constitutional right of all South Africans, and towards increasing food security and improving population health, various policies, programmes and regulations have been developed and implemented by the government to rectify the situation. The paper presents an overview of food composition within these public health policies, programmes and regulations and unpacks the important role of accurate food composition data.

A nutritional survey including food-frequency consumption, 24-h dietary recall and anthropometric measurements was applied to 241 children from 6 to 12 years old. The amounts of the different classes of phenolic compounds were established from Food Composition Tables available in phenol-explorer website. Statistics analyses were performed using IBM SPSS 20.0. Nutritional status assessment showed underweight (2.2%), low weight (12.7%), overweight (12.7%) and obesity (7.4%). Mean intake of phenolic compounds was 412 mg/day. Most consumed foods were infusions and sugar products, consumption of vegetables, fruits and dairy products were low compared to recommendations for this age. Considering that polyphenols have protective health effects, its low consumption could be a risk of development of chronic non communicable diseases. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Processed foods are the major contributors towards sodium intake thereby pre-disposing individuals towards risk of Diet Related Non-communicable Diseases (DR-NCDs). There is paucity of data on sodium and potassium content of processed packaged foods in India. The sodium and potassium content of the most commonly consumed processed packaged foods (n = 154) was analyzed by AOAC 969.23 method using Flame Photometer. Highest analyzed mean sodium content was found in soups (4823 +/- 1674 mg/100 g, range -3220 to 8000 mg/100 g) while the potassium content was highest in chips with a mean of 778 +/- 260 mg/100 g and ranged between 360 and 1220 mg/100 g. A higher potassium to sodium ratio is desirable for good health, however only 20% of the analyzed products were found to have the same. Therefore, there is a need to monitor the sodium and potassium content of the processed packaged foods and to reformulate the products to bring about favorable potassium to sodium ratio.

AB The holistic approach required to assess diet sustainability is hindered by lack of comprehensive databases compiling relevant food metrics. Those metrics are generally scattered in different data sources with various levels of aggregation hampering their matching. The objective was to develop a general methodology to compile food metrics describing diet sustainability dimensions into a single database and to apply it to the French context. Each step of the methodology is detailed: indicators and food metrics identification and selection, food list definition, food matching and values assignment. For the French case, nutrient and contaminant content, bioavailability factors, distribution of dietary intakes, portion sizes, food prices, greenhouse gas emission, acidification and marine eutrophication estimates were allocated to 212 commonly consumed generic foods. This generic database compiling 279 metrics will allow the simultaneous evaluation of the four dimensions of diet sustainability, namely health, economic, social and environmental, dimensions.

AB Consumption of processed meats is reported to be the second largest contributor to total dietary sodium intake. This study aims to describe the contribution of commonly consumed processed pork products to total salt intake. A large variation was found in the sodium content between similar products. Sodium content (mg/100 g) for bacon ranged from 558 to 1570, russians from 762 to 1403, viennas from 480 to 1340 and ham from 696 to 1360 respectively. When converting sodium content from 100 g to serving size, different products contributed the most sodium to the diet. A serving size of brawn (125 g uncooked) will contribute on average 983 mg sodium to total sodium intake. Pork bangers will contribute the lowest amount of sodium (similar to 400 mg) to the diet (similar to 4% of RDI). Reported daily intake are smaller than indicated serving sizes and the contribution of processed meat to sodium intake can be predicted to be lesser than expected. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Translating food intake data into phytochemical outcomes is a crucial step in investigating potential health benefits. The aim of this review was to examine the tools for determining dietary-derived polyphenol intakes for estimated intake studies. Published studies from 2004 to 2014 reporting polyphenol food composition information were sourced with 157 studies included. Six polyphenol subclasses were identified. One quarter of studies (n = 39) reported total flavonoids intake with 27% reporting individual flavonoid compounds. Assessing multiple compounds was common with approximately 10% of studies assessing seven (n = 13), six (n = 12) and five (n = 14) subclasses of polyphenol. There was no pattern between reported flavonoids compounds and subclass studied. Approximately 60% of studies relied on publicly accessible food composition data to estimate dietary polyphenols intake with 33% using two or more tools. This review highlights the importance of publicly accessible composition databases for estimating polyphenol intake and provides a reference for tools available globally. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Study was conducted to determine the biochemical constituents in coconut (Cocos nucifera L.) haustorium, a spongy tissue formed during coconut germination. Results indicated that 100g of dried coconut haustorium contained 1.05 +/- 0.2% ash, 44.2 +/- 4.6% soluble sugar, 24.5 +/- 3.2% starch, 5.50 +/- 0.3% protein, 1.99 +/- 0.9% fat, 5.72 +/- 0.4% soluble dietary fibre, 20.3 +/- 1.9% insoluble dietary fibre, and 146 +/- 14.3 mg phenolics. Mineral profiling showed that it contained 145 +/- 8.6, 104 +/- 9.6, 33.9 +/- 8.2, 30.9 +/- 1.9, 9.45 +/- 2.1, 0.292 +/- 0.1, 2.53 +/- 0.2 and 1.20 +/- 0.1 mg of K, Mg, Ca, P, Mn, Cu, Fe and Zn, respectively. Antioxidant activity assay indicated that 100g haustorium was equivalent to 1918 +/- 173, 170 +/- 20.4, 72.8 +/- 14.7 and 860 +/- 116 mg of Trolox as measured by CUPRAC, FRAP, DPPH and ABTS, respectively. Amino acid score indicated that methionine + cysteine (57.6%), phenylalanine + tyrosine (32.6%), leucine (45.7%) and isoleucine (68%) are found less in haustorium. Further studies needed in developing nutritionally balanced formulations using coconut haustorium, which will be useful for lactose intolerant children. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB There is dearth of documented information on nutrient retention of Dioscorea cayenensis products. This study was carried out to evaluate effects of processing methods on nutrient and antinutrient retention of yellow yam products. Fresh Dioscorea cayenensis tubers were purchased from Bodija market in Ibadan, peeled, cut into small pieces, divided into nine portions. One portion was treated as raw sample, and others processed into local delicacies. All nine samples were analysed for proximate, mineral, vitamin and antinutrient composition using AOAC methods. Data were analysed using ANOVA at p = 0.05. Raw yam contained 66.79 g moisture, 2.62 g crude protein, 0.27 g lipid, 0.17 g fibre, 0.63 g ash, 29.69 g carbohydrates, 262.30 mg potassium, 61.53 mg magnesium, 0.79 mg iron, 0.39 mg zinc, and yielded 108.26 kcal energy with insignificant vitamin content/100 g edible portion. Processing significantly improved macronutrients and energy content with significant reduction in all antinutrients of products (p < 0.05). The yam products can serve as staple source of energy to consumers. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Plant foods are endowed with micronutrients but an understanding of bioavailability is essential in countries primarily dependent on plant based foods. Bioavailability depends majorly on food synergies. This review examines the nature of certain food synergies and methods to screen and establish it as a strategy to control micronutrient deficiency in the populations. Strong evidence on the synergistic effect of inclusion of vitamin C rich fruits and non-vegetarian foods in enhancing the bioavailability of iron has been demonstrated. Fat is found to be synergistic for vitamin A absorption. Red wine and protein have been explored for zinc absorption and effect of fat has been studied for vitamin D. Methods for screening of bioavailability, and biomarkers to demonstrate the synergistic effects of foods are required. Translation of food synergy as a strategy requires adaptation to the context and popularization of intelligent food synergies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In order to meet growing public health nutrition challenges in Central Eastern European Countries (CEEC) and Balkan countries, development of a Research Infrastructure (RI) and availability of an effective nutrition surveillance system are a prerequisite. The building block of this RI is an innovative tool called DIET ASSESS & PLAN (DAP), which is a platform for standardized and harmonized food consumption collection, comprehensive dietary intake assessment and nutrition planning. Its unique structure enables application of national food composition databases (FCDBs) from the European food composition exchange platform (28 national FCDBs) developed by EuroFIR (http://www.eurofir.org/) and in addition allows communication with other tools. DAP is used for daily menu and/or long-term diet planning in diverse public sector settings, foods design/reformulation, food labelling, nutrient intake assessment and calculation of the dietary diversity indicator, Minimum Dietary Diversity-Women (MDD-W). As a validated tool in different national and international projects, DAP represents an important RI in public health nutrition epidemiology in the CEEC region. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Extracts of twenty locally available Sri Lankan fruits were analysed for 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging activity, ferrous reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC) and vitamin C content. The results showed that gooseberry (Phyllanthus emblica 'local') exhibited the highest DPPH scavenging activity (111.25 mg ascorbic acid equivalent antioxidant capacity (AEAC)/g), FRAP (1022.05 lmol FeSO4/g), TPC (915.7 mg gallic acid equivalents (GAE)/100 g), TFC (873.2 mg catechin equivalents (CE)/100 g) and vitamin C (136.8 mg ascorbic acid equivalents (AAE)/100 g), respectively. Sugar apple (Annona squamosa 'local') and star fruit (Averrhoa carambola 'Honey Sweet') obtained the second and third highest antioxidant activities in terms of rankings of FRAP, DPPH activities, TPC, TFC and vitamin C content. Strong correlation between vitamin C, TPC and TFC with FRAP and DPPH showed their contribution to antioxidant capacity. Among the selected fruits, underutilized fruit cultivar gooseberry showed the highest overall antioxidant potential. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Aflatoxin M1 (AFM1), a potentially carcinogenic compound, is found in milk obtained from animals that consume contaminated feed. Spectra of bovine milk, spiked with AFM1 (0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08 and 0.1 mu g/l) were acquired using attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared ATR-FTIR) spectrometer. Spectra revealed significant differences among pure and AFM1 spiked samples in spectral regions 1800-650 cm(-1) and 3689-3499 cm(-1), which may be attributed to complex chemical structure of AFM1. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed clear clustering of samples (p <= 0.05). The models could successfully classify (> 86%) and detect even 0.02 mu g/l AFM1 in milk (p <= 0.05) using SIMCA. AFM1 was best predicted in wavenumber range of 1800-650 cm(-1) with coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.99 and 0.98, for calibration and validation, respectively, using partial least square (PLS) regression. The study indicated feasibility of ATR-FTIR spectroscopy and chemometrics in rapid detection and quantification of AFM1 in milk. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
