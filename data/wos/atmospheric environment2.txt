AB The radiative impacts of black carbon (BC) and brown carbon (BrC) are widely recognized but remain highly uncertain. The Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) provides measurements of aerosol optical depth (AOD), aerosol absorption optical depth (AAOD), and other parameters. AERONET AAOD measurements have been used to estimate the relative contributions of BC and BrC to the total absorption at select sites and have the potential to be used across the global network, but the accuracy of the partitioning method has not been established and the uncertainties not characterized. We made surface-level measurements of aerosol optical properties from January 13 to February 10, 2013, and from December 25, 2014, to January 13, 2015, at Fresno, California. The contribution of BrC and BC to the absorption at 405 nm was estimated from the surface-level measurements using a combined mass absorption coefficient and thermodenuder method. The surface-level measurements were compared with BC and BrC absorption at 440 nm estimated from AERONET measurements of the absolute AAOD and the absorption angstrom ngstrom exponent (AERONET-AAE method). In 2013, AERONET results showed that BC and BrC contributed 67% and 33%, respectively, of absorption at 440 nm while the surface-level measurements showed that BC and BrC contributed 89% and 11%, respectively, of absorption at 405 nm. In 2014, AERONET results showed BC and BrC absorption were 72% and 28%, respectively, and the BC and BrC surface measurements were 68% and 32%, respectively. The boundary layer conditions showed that the comparison between AERONET measurements and surface-based estimates was more appropriate in 2014 than in 2013. As a result, AERONET measurements and surface-based estimates had strong or moderate correlations and slopes near unity in 2014. Thus, surface measurements were more representative of column BC and BrC absorption in 2014.

AB China produces the most cement product worldwide, and cement plants (CPs) have been regarded as the largest anthropogenic sources of atmospheric mercury (Hg) emissions in China since 2009. Onsite studies of this source are scarce compare to the huge numbers of CPs in China. Hence, quantifying Hg emissions from more CPs is needed in reducing the large uncertainties existed in the current Hg emission inventories and for assessing subsequent impacts of Hg on human and ecosystem health. In this study, two pre-calciner CPs in Guizhou province of Southwest China were selected for quantifying the emission factor and mass balance of Hg. Results showed that Hg emission levels in the two CPs were obviously different due to the differences in Hg input and circulation in the production system. In cement plant #1 (CP #1), the input and output of Hg reached a dynamic equilibrium condition, the emission factor was 76.1 mg Hg.t(-1) clinker, and Hg concentration in the stack flue gas was in the range of 14.46-16.64 mu g m(-3). In cement plant #2 (CP #2), Hg was in an enriching status because it was a new plant with operation of several months and most input Hg was retained inside the production system, hence with a much lower emission factor of 1.8 mg Hg.t(-1) clinker and Hg concentration of 0.15-0.49 mu g m(-3) in the stack gas. Kiln tail stack was the main output pathway of Hg in the clinker production process. With removal efficiency of 73.06% and 99.95% at kiln tail by ESP in CP #1 and humidifier + ESP-FF in CP #2, respectively, Hg emitted into the atmosphere was mainly in the forms of gaseous oxidized mercury (He2+) and gaseous elemental mercury (Hg-0). Besides, the operation mode (on or off) of raw mill had great impact on the concentration and speciation of Hg in flue gas and flue gas temperature at kiln tail. In the clinker production system, limestone is the main source of Hg input (41.4-56.4%), followed by the fueled coal (15.3-32.5%). While, in the clinker to cement production process, the additives (mainly gypsum from coal-fired power plants, 83.2-94.4%) was the main source of Hg in the cement because Hg concentration in the clinker was very low.

AB In this study, we used ground-measured air pollutants and various remote sensing and meteorological datasets to explore the possible causes of the severe particulate matter (PM) pollution episodes of October and November 2015 in Northeast China. The three pollution episodes in different regions were elaborately characterized by analyzing the time variation of PM2.5 and other pollutants, e.g., CO, NO2, and SO2. The results from MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) revealed that during the study period, dramatic crop residue burning occurred in Northeast China. Combining its time variation and spatial distribution with air pollutants, the crop residue burning was inferred to have a direct influence on the first and second pollution episodes, especially in Heilongjiang Province. Since a cold wave swept Northeast China beginning on 4th November, the PM pollutants were assumed to be transported southward. This assumption was further verified by the backward and forward trajectory models. Additionally, the suddenly increased relative humidity beginning on 7th November and the week of no wind after the cold wave also greatly contributed to the most severe pollution of Liaoning and Jilin on approximately 8th November. Lastly, we compared air quality indexes and pollutants from remote sensing with ground-measured datasets; the results indicated that there were certain correlations and spatial consistency between the two types of datasets, except for UVAI, which is meaningful to the area without an effective ground monitoring network.

AB Soil deposition is an essential pathway for tropospheric ozone (O-3) removal, but its controlling factors remain unclear. Here, we explored the variability of soil O-3 resistance in response to soil texture. To this aim, data of O-3 deposition over bare soil obtained from micrometeorological measurements under contrasted meteorological conditions for five sites were used. The results obtained are twofold: (i) soil resistance (R-soll) increased with soil surface relative humidity (RHsurf), but (ii) this relationship exhibited large site-by-site variability. Further analysis showed that the minimum soil resistance (corresponding to completely thy soil surface or RHsurf = 0%) and the increase of R-soll with RHsurf are both linked to soil clay content. These results can be explained by (i) the soil surface available for O-3 deposition at a microscopic scale which is a function of the soil specific surface area, and (ii) the capacity of a soil to adsorb water according to its clay content and therefore to reduce the surface active for O-3 deposition. From these results, a new parameterization has been established to estimate R-soll as a function of RHsurf and soil clay fraction.

AB Sulfur dioxide (SO2), a criteria pollutant, and sulfate (SO42-) deposition are major environmental concerns in the eastern U.S. and both have been on the decline for two decades. In this study, we use satellite column SO2 data from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), and SO42- wet deposition data from the NADP (National Atmospheric Deposition Program) to investigate the temporal and spatial relationship between trends in SO2 emissions and the downward sulfate wet deposition over the eastern U.S. from 2005 to 2015. To establish the relationship between SO2 emission sources and receptor sites, we conducted a Potential Source Contribution Function (PSCF) analysis using HYSPLIT back trajectories for five selected Air Quality System (AQS) sites (Hackney, OH, Akron, OH, South Fayette, PA, Wilmington, DE, and Beltsville, MD) - in close proximity to NADP sites with large downward SO42- trends since 2005. Back trajectories were run for three summers (JJA) and three winters (DJF) and used to generate seasonal climatology PSCFs for each site. The OMI SO2 and interpolated NADP sulfate deposition trends were normalized and overlapped with the PSCF, to identify the areas that had the highest contribution to the observed drop. The results suggest that emission reductions along the Ohio River Valley have led to decreases in sulfate deposition in eastern OH and western PA (Hackney, Akron and South Fayette). Farther to the east, emission reductions in southeast PA resulted in improvements in sulfate deposition at Wilmington, DE, while for Beltsville, reductions in both the Ohio River Valley and nearby favorably impacted sulfate deposition. For Beltsville, sources closer than 300 km from the site contribute roughly 56% observed deposition trends in winter, and 82% in summer, reflecting seasonal changes in transport pattern as well as faster oxidation and washout of sulfur in summer. This suggests that emissions and wet deposition are linked through not only the location of sources relative to the observing sites, but also to photochemistry and the weather patterns characteristic to the region, as evidenced by a west to east shift in the contribution between winter and summer. The method developed here is applicable to other regions with significant trends such as China and India, and can be used to estimate the potential benefits of emission reduction in those areas.

AB Levoglucosan has been extensively used as a molecular marker of biomass burning in source-apportionment studies over the last few decades. However, recent studies suggest that the atmospheric lifetime of levoglucosan may be in the order of only 1-2 days under summertime conditions relevant to prescribed/wildfires. Implications of levoglucosan reactivity to wintertime conditions, however, remain uncertain despite significant contributions of domestic wood combustion to wintertime air quality. This study presents smog chamber experiments to investigate levoglucosan decay during photo-oxidation of wood smoke over a temperature range between -8 and 10 degrees C.
   Significant decay in particle wall-loss corrected levoglucosan is only observed around 10 degrees C in these experiments. Theoretical analysis shows that the apparent chemical lifetime of levoglucosan increases at lower temperatures as well as at higher organic aerosol mass concentrations as a result of smaller vapor fractions. The chemical lifetime of a molecular marker is commonly interpreted by a relationship between relative decay in particle wall-loss corrected marker concentrations versus integrated OH exposure. However, this relationship strongly depends on vapor wall-loss rates in addition to temperature, organic aerosol concentrations, and OH concentrations. Therefore, inferred lifetimes from a small set of experiments from a single chamber cannot easily be generalized for the full range of atmospheric smoke conditions.

AB Regional-scale air quality models and observations at routine air quality monitoring sites are used to determine attainment/non-attainment of the ozone air quality standard in the United States. In current regulatory applications, a regional-scale air quality model is applied for a base year and a future year with reduced emissions using the same meteorological conditions as those in the base year. Because of the stochastic nature of the atmosphere, the same meteorological conditions would not prevail in the future year. Therefore, we use multi-decadal observations to develop a new method for estimating the confidence bounds for the future ozone design value (based on the 4th highest value in the daily maximum 8-hr ozone concentration time series, DM8HR) for each emission loading scenario along with the probability of the design value exceeding a given ozone threshold concentration at all monitoring sites in the contiguous United States. To this end, we spectrally decompose the observed DM8HR ozone time series covering the period from 1981 to 2014 using the Kolmogorov-Zurbenko (KZ) filter and examine the variability in the relative strengths of the short-term variations (induced by synoptic-scale weather fluctuations; referred to as synoptic component, SY) and the long-term component (dictated by changes in emissions, seasonality and other slow-changing processes such as climate change; referred to as baseline component, BL). Results indicate that combining the projected change in the ozone baseline level with the adjusted synoptic forcing in historical ozone observations enables us to provide a probabilistic assessment of the efficacy of a selected emissions control strategy in complying with the ozone standard in future years. In addition, attainment demonstration is illustrated with a real-world application of the proposed methodology by using air quality model simulations, thereby helping build confidence in the use of regional-scale air quality models for supporting regulatory policies.

AB The near-roadway pollutant dispersion model RLINE was evaluated for prediction of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and black carbon (BC) concentrations. Model predictions were compared with continuous, yearlong measurements from two near-roadway sites in the San Francisco Bay Area. Heavy-duty diesel trucks were a significant source of NOx and BC at both sites. Characterization of temporal variations in heavy-duty truck activity on diurnal, weekly, and seasonal scales were included in this study; truck traffic and emissions are not well-correlated with passenger vehicle or total traffic volumes. For both pollutants, more than 90% of predicted 24-h average concentrations were within a factor of two of observations at both near-roadway monitoring sites. The model responds appropriately to seasonal variations in meteorology and day-of-week variations in emissions. RLINE model performance for NOx was better overall than for BC. Reducing uncertainties in emission factors would help to improve model performance for BC.

AB A reference height that often needs to be assumed in aerosol retrieval from Raman lidar tends to cause high uncertainty in retrieving the vertical distribution of aerosol optical properties. Here, a novel method is proposed to determine the height-revolved reference height, which is then used to retrieve aerosols from Raman lidar. This method can automatically avoid the atmospheric layers with the presence of aerosols, clouds and low signal to noise ratio (SNR). Based on elastic (at 355 nm) and inelastic (at 387 nm) signals collected during the period from 5 December 2016 to 5 March 2017 by a ground-based Raman lidar in Beijing, China, the aerosol optical properties, such as extinction coefficient, backscattering coefficient and lidar ratio have been successfully retrieved. Results show that the averaged nighttime aerosol optic depth (AOD) from Raman lidar is in good agreement with early morning AOD retrieved from a collocated sunphotometer. The AOD exhibits a strong diurnal variation with a peak at 1500 Beijing time. On average, the nighttime AOD at 355 nm is 0.32, whereas the daytime AOD is 0.72 over Beijing during the study period. The column averaged lidar ratio is 44 sr at 355 nm, roughly consistent with previous studies. Our findings shed light on the pathways towards improving the retrieval of vertical distribution of aerosols optical properties during nighttime.

AB Nitrated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (NPAHs) are derived from PAHs, which are ubiquitous in the aqueous and atmospheric environments, and whose mutagenicity and carcinogenicity are much higher than that of PAHs. Therefore, their environmental transformation has attracted a lot of attention. In the present study, direct and indirect UV photodegradation kinetics of two NPAHs (1-nitropyrene and 1,8-dinitropyrene) in snow were investigated. It was found that the kinetics followed the pseudo-first-order kinetics with the photochemical degradation rate 0.3773 h(-1) for 48.98 nM 1-NP and 0.3653 h(-1) for 41.00 nM 1,8-DNP. Photosensitizers (hydrogen peroxide and nitrate) promoted the photodegradation of NPAHs. Considering the lower temperature and less microorganisms in snow environment, the photodegradation can be a key factor in determining the fate of NPAHs in sunlit surface snow. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the photodegradation of NPAHs in snow.

AB The formation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) from toluene can impact urban air quality and therefore human health. Most SOA studies have focused on OH chemistry; however recent work suggests that chlorine atoms (CI) may affect tropospheric chemistry more than previously assumed. This work focuses on SOA formation from Cl-initiated oxidation of toluene under different conditions. The fast reaction between Cl and toluene enabled complete consumption of toluene in environmental chamber experiments and aging of the toluene SOA. A high resolution time-of-flight chemical ionization mass spectrometer was used to observe several generations of gas-phase products. The presence of nitric oxides (NOx) appears to delay the formation of later generation products. Data from an aerosol chemical speciation monitor suggest that all SOA formed had high oxidation state, and that the bulk organic composition was different for SOA from Cl-dominated reactions compared to SOA from OH-dominated reactions. Addition of oxidant after all toluene had been consumed did not result in a significant change in the organic aerosol oxidation state, suggesting that the system may have reached an oxidative end-point in the particle phase.

AB The reactions of 1-chlorocyclopentene with tropospheric oxidants, Cl, OH and O-3 are studied to measure the rate coefficients at 298 K and 800 Torr of N-2 using the relative rate method with butene, cyclopentene and butane as references. The concentrations of the organics are measured by Gas Chromatograpy technique. The measured average rate coefficient values of k(Cl), k(OH) and k(O3) (in cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1)) are (3.51 +/- 1.26) x 10(-10), (5.97 +/- 1.08) x 10(-11) and (1.50 +/- 0.19) x 10(-17), respectively. In addition, the rate coefficient for reaction of OH with 1-chlorocyclopentene at 298 K and 30 Torr was also measured using an absolute method of laser photolysis-laser induced fluorescence technique, and the k(OH) value is found to be (6.01 +/- 0.70) x 10(-71) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1). The stable products formed during the reaction of Cl, OH and O-3 initiated oxidation of the 1-chlorocyclopentene in presence of air are characterized by GCMS. The abstraction and addition products are identified among them, the latter are found to be major products. The experimental results are supported by molecular orbital calculations, and abstraction of the allylic hydrogen atoms is predicted to be the major abstraction channel. Calculations predict the preferential addition of chlorine atom to the carbon atom of the unsaturation center not having Cl attached to it. The rate coefficients of 1-chlorocyclopentene are compared with that of cyclopentene and substituted cyclopentene to understand the effect of substituent Cl on the reactivity. The measured rate coefficients have been used to calculate tropospheric lifetime of the compound to be 316, 2 and 26 h for Cl, OH and O-3, respectively. Based on these values, the major degradation pathway of 1-chlorocyclopentene is suggested to be its reaction with OH. Atmospheric impact of these molecules is local as tropospheric lifetime (tau) < 2 h. Using the tropospheric lifetime of 1-chlorocyclopentene, and its IR absorption cross-section in tropospheric IR window and under the assumption of a well mixed atmosphere, the radiative forcing of 1-chlorocyclopentene was estimated to be 22.41 mWm(-2) pp(b)(-1), and the global warming potentials for 20 and 100 years time horizon were calculated to be 0.01 and 0.003, respectively.

AB This paper aims to identify the meteorological conditions of severe foggy haze events that frequently occurred over North China. We analyzed data collected at 162 ground observation stations operated by China Meteorological Administration (CMA), as well as data from National Centers Environmental Prediction (NCEP) over North China from December 1, 2016 to January 9, 2017. During this period, more than 72% of the regional mean atmospheric visibility was less than 10 km, with a minimum of 1.15 km. The analysis on atmospheric background fields revealed that during the pollution development-maintenance period there were southerlies and lower wind speed in the lower troposphere compared to that during the pollution dissipation period. Slow southerlies transported the southern pollutants to North China, while high pressure system at the 500 hPa level and increasing temperature (caused by air pollutant absorbed radiation) at 850 hPa suppressed the convection and led to pollutants accumulation over the ground. During the pollution dissipation period, there were northerlies and higher wind speed, and the fast northerlies quickly transported the pollutants. The analysis on the dynamic and thermodynamic effect suggests that the smaller horizontal wind vertical shear is attributed to 500 hPa decreased wind speed. The air pollutant warming effect on 850 hPa from absorbed solar radiation and cooling effect on near surface from reduced radiation near surface could lead to a larger correlation between atmospheric visibility and thermodynamic conditions for more than 76%. This coupling structure between air pollutant and thermodynamic situation provide favorable conditions for foggy haze events under air pollutant transport and weak vertical exchange conditions. Therefore, in order to predict foggy haze episodes in North China, we need to better understand its dynamics, especially for decreased middle level wind speed and lower level south flow.

AB Tropospheric ozone (O-3) is a major photochemical pollutant during the summer in Beijing and an analysis of its sources and their regional contributions is important in the formulation of O-3 control strategies. A typical heavy O-3 pollution event occurred in Beijing from July 1 to July 10, 2015. The first two days were defined as clean days with a prevailing northerly wind and low O-3 concentrations. The following period from July 3 to July 10 was regarded as polluted days with a prevailing southerly wind and high O-3 concentrations. The Integrated Source Apportionment Method (ISAM) implemented in the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System Community Multiscale Air Quality (RAMS-CMAQ) model was applied to quantify the regional contributions to O-3 concentrations in Beijing during this pollution episode. The model evaluation shows that the model reproduced the spatiotemporal variations of meteorological conditions (temperature, relative humidity and wind vector) and concentration field (O-3 and NO2) well. The diurnal variations of O-3 and NOx in both urban and suburban areas are unimodal. The concentration of O-3 decreased rapidly in the urban areas after reaching a peak value, but only slowly in the suburbs. The peaks of NOx concentration in suburban areas appear around 05:00 a.m., while those in urban areas appear at 08:00 a.m. With the change in wind direction and enhanced local emissions, the O-3 in Beijing was mainly affected by the boundary conditions on clean days and increased by contributions from Tianjin, Hebei, Shandong, and local emissions on polluted days. By contrast, the O-3 precursor NO2 was mostly sourced from local and nearby emissions and was only slightly influenced by the meteorological conditions.

AB Very few comparative studies on atmospheric dry and wet nitrogen (N) deposition have been conducted in agro-pastoral catchment areas. In an effort to fill this knowledge gap, three interconnected land use types (cropland, mountain pasture, and plain pasture) with six sampling sites (Chinese cropland (CC), Chinese mountain pasture (CM), Chinese plain pasture (CP) Mongolia cropland (MC), Mongolia mountain pasture (MM) and Mongolia plain pasture (MP)) were selected in the transboundary regions of northwest China and western Mongolia. During 16 months from May 2014 to September 2015 atmospheric and precipitation samples were collected to assess levels of nitrogen deposition. Cropland had the highest NO3-N (1.0 mg N L-1 in China and 1.2 mg N L-1 in Mongolia) and NH4+-N concentrations (1.6 mg N L-1 in China and 2.0 mg N L-1 in Mongolia) in our six sampling sites. The CC experienced the highest wet deposition (5.2 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)), followed by MM pasture (3.2 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) while wet deposition in other sites ranged from 2.1 to 2.8 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). The ambient concentrations of NH3, NO2 and dry N deposition were significant higher in cropland than being other land use with 3.0, 3.8 and 1.2 mu g N m(-3) respectively in China and 2.2, 2.8 and 0.6 mu g N m(-3) respectively in Mongolia. The highest total N deposition was at CC (14.5 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) and MC (9.4 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)), followed by the mountain pasture (5.8-6.8 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)), and the plains pasture (5.6-5.7 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)). Overall, agro-pastoral catchments areas had relatively low total N deposition compared to other studies, and cropland had the highest wet and dry N deposition than mountain and plain pastures, and dry N deposition absolutely dominated the percentage (64-70% in cropland and 53-64% in pasture areas) of total atmospheric N deposition. Comparing the total N deposition in China and Mongolia, we found the CC had 54% higher value than in MC while the reverse was true for mountain pastures Mongolia received 17% more N.

AB Changing emissions of NOx and other ozone precursors drive trends in both production and loss of surface ozone, leading to surface ozone trends that differ according to the time of day. Consequently, the magnitude of the diurnal cycle in surface ozone is changing in several regions of the world. Changes in the diurnal cycle of ozone have implications for the metrics used to assess the impact of ozone on human health and vegetation, since different metrics are sensitive to different portions of the diurnal cycle. We use a high resolution model simulation to examine global changes in the magnitude of the diurnal cycle of O-3 between 1980 and 2015. The simulation reproduces the negative trends in the tropospheric NO2 column over the eastern United States and Europe, and the positive trends over East Asia, seen by the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). It also gives a reasonable reproduction of the change in the diurnal cycle of surface ozone seen at rural sites in the eastern United States between the 1990s and 2000s. The simulation shows that the magnitude of the surface O-3 diurnal cycle is increasing in regions with positive changes in NOx emissions, such as South and East Asia, and decreasing in regions with reductions in NOx emissions. It also shows changes in the diurnal cycle of the tropospheric ozone column, although these have fewer regions with statistically significant trends. These changes suggest that daily mean ozone is responding less than the mid-day ozone measured by the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) and OMI.

AB The total ozone (TO3) multi-sensor reanalysis data-base, on a global scale, is examined for trend variability during the period 1979-2017. A multiple regression model is applied to the seasonal and yearly time series for zonal belts and 2-D bins covering the entire globe. Piecewise linear trend and independent linear trend pattern consisting of three joined and separated lines, respectively, are used to disclose long-term TO3 variability. The first line is for the ozone decline period forced by the increase of ozone depleting substances (ODS) in the stratosphere, the second one stands for an initial recovery phase starting after the ODS overturning at the end of the 1990s, and the third one is for latest trends. Negative trends are estimated outside the tropics in the first segment, especially during spring and summer. Both trend models provide significant year-round declining trend over the entire globe of similar to 2% per 10 yr before the ODS overturning. Afterwards, in most cases trends are insignificant. However, significant positive trends are found for some latitudinal bands and bins at least in one of two post-ODS overturning segments. The number of bins with the upward trend is much larger than the number concerning bins with the downward trend. Significant positive year-round trends (similar to 2-4% per 10 yr) by both models are found over the entire globe, in the tropics, and poleward of 30 degrees parallel after the ODS overturning. All these results support the emergence of ozone recovery on a global scale following the decline in the 1980s and 1990s.

AB Previous studies exploring the impact of precursor emissions and meteorological variables on PM2.5 concentrations were typically conducted over a short period and in urban environments. In this analysis, near-surface sulfate and nitrate mass concentrations at a 10-km resolution over the North China Plain (NCP) from 2006 to 2014 were first obtained based on satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) data and the global 3D chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem) in combination with vertical profiles from Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO). Using ground-based PM2.5 component concentrations, our satellite-based model yielded correlation coefficients (r) of 0.72 for sulfate and 0.70 for nitrate. Second, the spatio-temporal patterns of the chemical composition and corresponding precursor gases collected from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) during the study period were analyzed. The highest levels of nitrate (similar to 30 mu g/m(3)) and sulfate (similar to 25 mu g/m(3)) were concentrated in Hebei, Shandong, Henan and Beijing, and the monthly variations of nitrate and NO2 presented a strong correlation coefficient (0.67). Inter-annual changes of nitrate and NO(2 )exhibited increasing trends of 1.43%/yr and 1.60%/yr, respectively. In contrast, sulfate and SO2 decreased at rates of 3.5%/yr and 0.76%/yr, respectively, and presented a negative correlation (similar to 0.54). Third, the relationships between the components or precursor gases and relative humidity (RH), planetary boundary layer height (PBLH), temperature (TEM) and wind speed (WS) were compared. The results showed that high levels of NO2 were usually accompanied by stable atmospheric conditions (i.e., low TEM, shallow PBLH, low RH and mild WS). Moreover, the nitrate concentration was often dependent on NO2, and they showed similar characteristics with meteorological factors. PBLH and WS had the greatest influence on nitrate concentrations, whereas the effects of RH and WS varied seasonally. Under beneficial conditions, i.e., high TEM, RH and PBLH and low WS, SO(2 )rapidly converted to sulfate and fluctuated inversely with the sulfate concentration. Overall, high nitrate levels were primarily associated with anthropogenic causes (i.e., extensive emissions), whereas meteorological conditions have a greater effect on the formation of sulfate concentrations than emissions.

AB Glyoxal (CHOCHO) and formaldehyde (HCHO) are organic trace gases that play an important role in tropospheric chemistry as oxidation products of a number of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). In this study, we report year-round daytime measurements of glyoxal and formaldehyde in the urban atmosphere of Madrid, Spain. Their vertical concentration profiles were retrieved using the Multi AXis Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) technique and a Radiative Transfer Model (RTM) that simulates solar photon paths through the atmosphere. The diurnal variations of HCHO show two distinct peaks during the day, in the early morning and late afternoon in spring and summer, while the second peak is shifted towards noon in autumn and winter, due to lower photolysis rates and more effective boundary layer accumulation of HCHO in those seasons. The HCHO surface mixing ratios range from 6 ppbv to 27 ppbv in spring-summer and from 10 ppbv to 30 ppbv in autumn-winter. Monthly hourly-averaged glyoxal surface mixing ratios in the early morning show higher values during winter, 2 ppbv, than in summer, 0.7 ppbv. We also evaluated the ratio between glyoxal and formaldehyde (R-GF) surface mixing ratios, as an indicator of the nature of VOCs precursors. The R-GF was also correlated with the measured NO2, which represents a direct signal of anthropogenic emissions, along with the VOCs emission inventories in Madrid. The Et u results yielded higher ratios in spring, 0.1-0.13, than in winter and autumn (in the range of 0.02-0.07) when NO2 levels were higher.

AB Heat-wave is one of key meteorological conditions causing the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) exceedance event in urban environment. In this study, the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF/Chem) was used to investigate an unusual heat-wave driven ozone (O-3) exceedance event occurring on May 17-19, 2017 in New York City (NYC) and surrounding areas. The WRF/Chem simulations were conducted over the three nested domains with the finest grid spacing of 1.3 km. The simulations were evaluated with various observational data including in situ measurements of air quality and meteorological variables as well as the Lidar-measured vertical profiles. Overall, the WRF/Chem successfully captured the diurnal variations of air quality (e.g., O-3 and nitrogen oxides (NOx)) and meteorological fields during the event. However, the O(3 )was under-predicted during the daytime peak hours but over-predicted during the nighttime. The under-predictions of O-3 were highly associated with over-estimation of the planetary-boundary-layer (PBL) heights and uncertainties of emissions (e.g., NOx, and volatile organic compounds, VOCs), whereas the over-predictions were likely attributed to underestimation of the PBL heights and strong vertical mixing. Several findings are obtained from this study. First, the PBL growth plays a critical role in the development of O-3 episode. The maximum PBLH and the largest PBL growth rates on a high O-3 day are higher than those on a low O-3 day. A strong low-level jet (LLJ) in the lower atmospheric boundary layer with increasing boundary-layer height was observed during the event. Second, the isoprene emissions calculated by the biogenic emission model are underestimated significantly in the WRF/Chem model, which leads to the underprediction of daily O-3 peak values. Third, the process analysis indicates that the local chemical productions are the dominant contributor with the contributions of 63-68% during the ozone-exceedance event.

AB In coastal regions and ocean areas, methanesulfonic acid (MSA; CH3SO3H) is present in considerable concentrations in the gas-phase and aerosols. It has been shown that MSA could contribute to growth and possibly form initial molecular cluster, which may lead to aerosol formation. However, quantitative concentrations and thermodynamic properties of MSA and sulfuric acid (SA; H2SO4) in the presence of water (W; H2O) remain largely uncertain. In this study, flow tube reactor was used to investigate the effects of each reactant on new particle formation (NPF) in a multi-component system consisting of MSA, SA, and W. Particles were measured for different combinations of reactants. It showed that a different order for reactant addition led to different experimental results, where the added MSA vapor to the SA-W binary system presented an obvious bimodal structure, for ternary system with SA added to the MSA-W, the similar bimodal phenomenon was not observed. The composition of clusters in the air flow was further analyzed by the commercial Atmospheric Pressure Interface Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometer (APi-TOF-MS, Tofwerk AG), which is equipped with a homemade chemical ionization (CI) source, mass peaks corresponding to clusters that contain smaller MSA or SA molecules were clearly observed, indicating that these clusters are exist and stable. In addition, quantum chemistry calculation-based evaporation rate values were applied in a cluster dynamics model to yield formation rates of 2.6 x 10(2) cm(-3)s(-1) and cluster concentrations under different simulation conditions. This study could provide some insight into how acids interact in the atmosphere.

AB Chemical characteristics and the sources of submicron particles (< 1 mu m in diameter) were investigated in Valle Alegre, the coastal area of Central Chile. The chemical composition of particles was studied by using a Soot particle Aerosol Mass Spectrometer and Multi-Angle Absorption Photometer. Submicron particles were dominated by organics (42% of mass) and sulfate (39% of mass) while the mass fractions of ammonium, nitrate and black carbon were much smaller (13, 2 and 4% of mass, respectively). Additionally, several metals (V, Zn, Fe, Cd, Cu, K, Na and Mg) were detected in submicron particles and also some of their inorganic salts (e.g. NaCl+, MgCl2+, CaCl2+, KCl+ and KNO3+). The sources of particles were examined by using Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF). Organic aerosol (OA) was divided into five factors by using PMF; hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA), biomass burning OA (BBOA), low-volatility oxygenated OA (LV-OOA), semi-volatile OA (SV-OOA) and marine oxygenated OOA (MOOA), Oxygenated factors (LV-OOA; SV-OOA and MOOA) comprised 75% of total OA with LV-OOA being the dominant factor (38% of OA). Sulfate had two major sources in Valle Alegre; similar to 70% of sulfate was related to anthropogenic sources through the oxidation of gas phase SO2 whereas similar to 24% of sulfate was associated with biogenic origin related to the oxidation of dimethyl sulfide in the marine environment. Regarding total submicron particle mass (campaign-average 9.5 mu g m(-3)), the contribution of anthropogenic sources was at least as large as that of biogenic origin.

AB Nitrogen oxides (NO and NO2, collectively NOx) derived from vehicle exhausts are critical pollutants with significant implications for urban air quality and human and environmental health. In this study, we investigate trends in measured ambient nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and NOx mixing ratios at urban traffic - dominated monitoring sites in the UK for the period 2009-2016. We apply an oxidant analysis approach alongside a number of assumptions to the ambient data to determine trends in the inferred primary NO2/NOx ratio, and examine evidence for enhanced vehicle "cold start" effects upon these inferred emissions. Ambient NO2 and NOx mixing ratios have experienced an overall decrease of 17.2% and 11.3% respectively for the locations considered over this time period. The inferred primary NO2/NOx ratio for the majority of the study locations is found to have fallen by 29% (from 0.175 to 0.125) as a monthly mean from 2009 to 2016, with a statistically significant median decrease of 0.32 percentage points per year. However, during cold weather (temperatures less than or equal to 5 degrees C), the inferred primary NO2/NOx ratio averaged across all locations, when compared with normal conditions (temperatures higher than 5 degrees C) increased from 0.062 (+/- 0.004) to 0.102 (+/- 0.001) (64.5% higher) and from 0.056 (+/- 0.004) to 0.098 (+/- 0.001) (75% higher) for cold morning and evening rush hours, with substantially greater increases at some sites. This "cold start" result suggests that the combination of recent vehicle driving history and ambient weather conditions, in conjunction with technological constraints on the operating temperature range of emission control systems in some vehicles, affects NOx emissions and hence has a detrimental impact upon air quality in urban environments. Increased cold start emissions imply an increased NO2 - derived health burden from air pollution, under certain meteorological conditions, assessment of which should consider changes in vehicle use as a result of weather, and hence altered personal exposure.

AB Statistical emulators are used to approximate the output of complex physical models when their computational burden limits any sensitivity and uncertainty analysis of model output to variation in the model inputs.
   In this paper, we introduce a flexible emulator which is able to handle multivariate model outputs and missing values. The emulator is based on a spatial model and the D-STEM software, which is extended to include emulator fitting using the EM algorithm. The missing values handling capabilities of the emulator are exploited to keep the number of model output realisations as low as possible when the computing burden of each realisation is high.
   As a case study, we emulate the output of the Atmospheric Dispersion Modelling System (ADMS) used by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) to model the air quality of the city of Aberdeen (UK). With the emulator, we study the city air quality under a discrete set of realisations and identify conditions under which, with a given probability, the 40 mu g m(-3) yearly average concentration limit for NO2 of EU legislation is not exceeded at the locations of the city monitoring stations.
   The effect of missing values on the emulator estimation and probability of exceedances are studied by means of simulations.

ID BLACK CARBON; ANTHROPOGENIC EMISSIONS; GAS; POLLUTION
AB Flaring emissions are a major concern due to large uncertainties in the amount of chemical compounds released into the atmosphere and their evolution with time. A methodology based on DMSP (Defense Meteorological Satellite Program) nighttime light data combined with regional gas flaring volumes from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Centers for Environmental Information (NOAA-NCEI) has been developed to estimate flaring emissions. This method is validated in Nigeria where individual field company data are available. The spatial distribution of CO2, CH4, NMVOCs, CO, OC, BC, SO2 and NOx is derived for the African continent for the period 1995-2010.
   A range of the emissions due to flaring is estimated based on the range of emission factors (EFs) for each chemical species. An average decrease in CO2 emissions of about 30% is found over Africa from 1995 to 2010, with Nigeria being the largest contributor to this reduction (up to 50%). Changes in the spatial distribution with time indicate local increases, particularly at offshore platforms, which are attributed to a lack of regulations as well as aging infrastructures in oil and gas fields.
   Comparisons with current inventories reveal differences in the location and magnitude of point source emissions. For chemical compounds such as NMVOCs and CH4, the ECLIPSE and EDGAR country-level values are considerably higher than the highest flaring emission estimated in this study for 2005. For species such as CO, OC, BC, SO2 and NOx the emissions provided by the ECLIPSE and EDGAR inventories are generally within the same order of magnitude as the average values found in this study, with the exception of OC, BC and SO2 in which EDGAR provides much lower emissions. These discrepancies are likely due to either differences in the methodologies used to estimate the emissions, in the values of the emission factors considered, or in the definition of flaring sector. Our current estimations suggest that BC, CH4 and CO2 flaring emissions in Africa account for 1-15% (on average 7%), 0.5-8% (on average 2%) and 8-13% (on average 11%) of African total anthropogenic emissions, respectively. The contribution of flaring to African anthropogenic emissions varies widely among countries. For example, in Nigeria the average emissions due to flaring are estimated to be as high as 18% for BC, 10% for CH4 and 50% for CO2, which is significantly greater than the continental average and highlights the importance of emissions in flaring areas.

AB Background: Pollen is naturally emitted and is relevant for health, crop sciences and monitoring climate change, among others. Despite their relevance, pollen is often insufficiently monitored resulting in a lack of data. Thus, spatial modelling of pollen concentrations for unmonitored areas is necessary. The aim of this study was to develop an automatic system for calculating daily pollen concentrations at sites without regular pollen monitoring.
   Method: We used data from 14 pollen taxa collected during 2015 at 26 stations distributed across Bavaria, Germany. The proposed system was based on the Kriging interpolation method to spatially model pollen concentrations for unmonitored areas, in combination with regression of environmental parameters. The method also took into account weather effects on daily pollen concentrations.
   Results: An automatic system was developed for calculating current pollen concentrations at any location of the county. The results were displayed as daily pollen concentrations per m(3) in maps of 1 km(2) resolution. The models are trained automatically for every day by using the pollen and weather inputs. Automatic inputs will increase the usability of the model. In 50% of the cases, Gaussian Kriging was selected as the optimal model. An R-2 of 0.5 is reached in external validation without considering the effect of the weather. An R-2 of 0.7 is reached after considering the effect of daily weather parameters.
   Conclusions: A fully automatic pollen network (ePIN) was built in Bavaria during 2018 that delivers data on-line without delay. The proposed method allows for a comparably small number of automatic devices per study area, but still providing information on pollen on any location in the study area.

AB To link short-term exposures of air pollutants to health outcomes, scientists must use high temporal and spatial resolution estimates of PM2.5 concentrations. In this work, we develop a daily PM2.5 product at 1 x 1 km(2) spatial resolution across the eastern United States (east of 90 degrees W) with the aid of 1 x 1 km(2) MAIAC aerosol optical depth (AOD) data, 36 x 36 km(2) WRF-Chem output, 1 x 1 km(2) land-use type from the National Land Cover Database, and 0.125 degrees x 0.125 degrees ERA-Interim reanalysis meteorology. A gap-filling technique is applied to MAIAC AOD data to construct robust daily estimates of AOD when the satellite data are missing (e.g., areas obstructed by clouds or snow cover). The input data are incorporated into a multiple-linear regression model trained to surface observations of PM2.5 from the EPA Air Quality System (AQS) monitoring network. The model generates a high-fidelity estimate (r(2) = 0.75 using a 10-fold random cross-validation) of daily PM2.5 throughout the eastern United States. Of the inputs to the statistical model, WRF-Chem output (r(2) = 0.66) is the most important contributor to the skill of the model. MAIAC AOD is also a strong contributor (r(2) = 0.52). Daily PM2.5 output from our statistical model can be easily integrated into county-level epidemiological studies. The novelty of this project is that we are able to simulate PM2.5 in a computationally efficient manner that is constrained to ground monitors, satellite data, and chemical transport model output at high spatial resolution (1 x 1 km(2)) without sacrificing the temporal resolution (daily) or spatial coverage ( > 2,000,000 km(2)).

AB We report the determination of ammonia (NH3) diffusive sampling rates for six different designs of commercial diffusive samplers (CEH ALPHA sampler, Gradko diffusion tube, Gradko DIFRAM-400, Passam ammonia sampler, and ICS Maugeri Radiello radial sampler (blue and white turbulence barriers)), together with the validation test results for a pumped sampler (CEH DELTA denuder). The devices were all exposed in the UK's National Physical Laboratory's (NPL) controlled atmosphere test facility (CATFAC). For each of the seven diffusive sampler exposure tests there were traceable concentrations of ammonia (in the range 3-25 mu g m(-3)) generated under well-defined conditions of temperature, relative humidity and wind speed, which are applicable to a variety of ambient monitoring environments. The sampler exposure time at each concentration was 28 days, except for the radial devices, which were exposed for 14 days. The work relied on the dilution of newly developed stable Primary Standard Gas Mixtures (PSMs) prepared by gravimetry in passivated gas cylinders as a method of improving the metrological traceability of ammonia measurements. The exposed diffusive samplers were sent blind to the participants for analysis and the reported NH3 concentrations were then compared against the known reference concentration. From the results for each sampler type a diffusive sampling rate was calculated and compared against the rate used routinely by the participants. Some measurement results were in good agreement with the known traceable reference concentration (particularly for one diffusive sampler design (ALPHA)), while other devices exhibited over-reading and under-reading (each with a clear bias). The new diffusive sampling rates determined in the laboratory study were then applied to measurements in a field comparison campaign, and this was found to deliver an improvement in agreement between the different devices deployed.

ID REDUCTION
AB A parameterised non-intrusive reduced order model (P-NIROM) based on proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and machine learning methods has been firstly developed for model reduction of pollutant transport equations. Our motivation is to provide rapid response urban air pollution predictions and controls. The varying parameters in the P-NIROM are pollutant sources. The training data sets are obtained from the high fidelity modelling solutions (called snapshots) for selected parameters (pollutant sources, here) over the parameter space R-P. From these training data sets, the machine learning method is used to generate the relationship between the reduced solutions and inputs (pollutant sources) over R-P. Furthermore a set of hyper-surface functions associated with each POD basis function is constructed for representing the fluid dynamics over the reduced space. The accuracy of the P-NIROM is highly dependent on the quality of the training set, here obtained from the high fidelity model. Over existing machine learning methods, the P-NIROM algorithm proposed here has the advantages that (1) it is combined with NIROM, thus providing rapid and reasonably accurate solutions; and (2) it is a robust and efficient approach for representation of any parametrised partial differential equations as the model parameters/inputs vary. In this study, we demonstrate the way how to implement the P-NIROM for the pollutant transport equation (but not limited to due to its robustness). Its predictive capability is illustrated in a three-dimensional (3-D) simulation of power plant plumes over a large region in China, where the varying parameters are the emission intensity at three locations. Results indicate that in comparison to the high fidelity model, the CPU cost is reduced by factor up to five orders of magnitude while reasonable accuracy remains.

AB This work describes a semi-empirical dynamic model for predicting ammonia volatilization from field-applied slurry. Total volatilization is the sum of first-order transfer from two pools: a "fast" pool representing slurry in direct contact with the atmosphere, and a "slow" one representing fractions less available for emission due to infiltration or other processes. This simple structure is sufficient for reproducing the characteristic course of emission over time. Values for parameters that quantify effects of the following predictor variables on partitioning and transfer rates were estimated from a large data set of emission from cattle and pig slurry (490 field plots in 6 countries from the ALFAM2 database): slurry dry matter, application method, application rate, incorporation (shallow or deep), air temperature, wind speed, and rainfall rate. The effects of acidification were estimated using a smaller dataset. Model predictions generally matched the measured course of emission over time in a reserved data subset used for evaluation, although the model over- or under-estimated emission for many individual plots. Mean error was ca. 12% of applied total ammoniacal nitrogen (and as much as 82% of measured emission) for 72 h cumulative emission, and model efficiency (fraction of observed variation explained by the model) was 0.5-0.7. Most of the explanatory power of the model was related to application method. The magnitude and sign of (apparent) model error varied among countries, highlighting the need to understand why measured emission varies among locations. The new model may be a useful tool for predicting fertilizer efficiency of field-applied slurries, assessing emission factors, and quantifying the impact of mitigation. The model can readily be applied or extended, and is available as an R package (ALFAM2, https://github.com/sashahafner/ALFAM2) or a simple spreadsheet (http://www.alfam.dk ).

AB We compared two approaches (denoted as Virkkula" and "Drinovec" equations) for the determination of black carbon via attenuation measurements with a transmissometer OT-21 (Magee Scientific) on quartz fiber filters from different station types (urban-traffic, rural-background and remote) within the Austrian air monitoring network. First, we evaluated the entire data set to compare the performance of the models in the determination of the loading parameter k and the mass attenuation cross section sigma. Then we investigate k and a for different station types. The data set comprises 299 filters, all representative for 24 h samples collected with High-Volume-Samplers. Mass concentrations ranged from approximately 5-100 mu g m(-3) and covered all seasons.
   Both approaches give statistically indistinguishable results of k with values of 1.00*10(-3) (+/- 2*10(-4)) and 0.97*10(-3) (+/- 1*10(-4)), respectively, if the entire data set is evaluated. The "Drinovec" approach gives slightly lower values for a than "Virkkula" with values of 32.1 m(2) g(-1) (+/- 1.1 m(2) g(-1)) and 35.3 m(2) g(-1) (+/- 1.9 m(2) g(-1)). If the data set is restricted to ATN < 300 only, no statistically relevant changes are obtained for k and a using the "Virkkula" equation. Applying the "Drinovec" equation both parameters, k and a increase when the data set is restricted.
   The investigation of the different station types yields values of k statistically not different from zero, whereas sigma values are different for the respective station types. Highest values of sigma = 33.7 m(2) g(-1) (+/- 1.4 m(2) g(-1)) were observed for the remote, followed by sigma = 31.8 m(2) g(-1) (+/- 0.5 m(2) g(-1)) for the rural-background station and lowest values of sigma = 24.4 m(2) g(-1) (+/- 0.5 m(2) g(-1)) for the urban-traffic stations, possibly reflecting the respective aerosol type.
   Based on the results for k and sigma using either overall values or station type specific values we performed an extensive validation, discussing the application of the transmissometer measurements for a quick, easy and non-destructive quantification of eBC on either fresh sampled or archived filters of different station types. Applying the method for stations not classified as urban, rural or remote a deviation of eBC and EC values up to 23% can be expected. If the station type is known and the respective k and sigma values are used this deviation goes down to 10% or lower. This would allow users to obtain long-term time-series going back to times when no on-line instruments were existing, and to obtain these data sets for sites where no on-line instruments are installed even now.

AB Through the use of monitoring, modeling, and emission inventories, the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) has identified residential wood combustion (RWC) as a significant source of air pollution in Oregon. Detailed emission inventories provide the best source of information to inform pollution reduction strategies. In order to refine and improve state and local RWC emission inventories, DEQ contracted with the Portland State University Survey Research Lab to perform a telephone survey on RWC in the Portland metro area. The goal of the project was to 1) quantify these emissions by type and location, and 2) to spatially allocate these emissions to US Census blocks in the study area and other parts of the state. Results, based on 1061 residences surveyed, showed that 4.3% of respondents burned wood for primary heating and 17.8% burned wood for secondary (backup heating or aesthetics) purposes. Primary burners burned four times more wood on average per device than secondary burners. As such, even though there were fewer primary burners they burned 51% of the total wood fuel combusted. The breakdown of estimated emissions of particulate matter 2.5 mu m or less (PM2.5) from primary and secondary burners is nearly even, with 46.5% of emissions coming from primary burning and 53.5% of emissions coming from secondary burning. Uncertified wood-stoves and inserts are the source of just over half (50.5%) the emissions in the Survey area, followed by emissions from certified woodstoves and inserts (26.3%), fireplaces (21.5%), pellet stoves (0.9%), and fire-log burning (0.8%). Survey results for burning activity and housing type showed good correlation, and were mapped to US Census housing data (units in structure) for block-groups. The Survey results also showed differences in burning behavior between urban/suburban and rural areas. This distinction coupled with housing types provided a method of spatial allocation for RWC activity and emissions that could be a useful tool for other states and regions.

AB The health effects of atmospheric particulate matter (PM) have become a major environmental concern in urban areas. Most PM studies are mainly designed to measure the "ambient" or "emitted" concentrations of PM. Some studies are specifically designed to address exposure to PM for pedestrians and/or commuters on-board vehicles or at bus stops, but less attention is paid to the exposure during physical exercise such as jogging. To this end, concentrations of both fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and black carbon (BC) were measured along three jogging trails in the densely populated city Macau in China. The three jogging trails include the campus of University of Macau (UM), Guia Municipal Park (GP), and Saivan Lake (SL). In our measurements, PM2.5 and BC ranged from 2.9 to 84.1 and 0.4-19.5 mu g/m(3), respectively. BC/PM2.5 ratio ranged from 0.016 to 0.448. Among all three jogging trails, the highest BC concentration was found at SL (19.5 mu g/m(3)), and the highest PM2.5 concentration was found at UM (84.1 mu g/m(3)). On the contrary, the BC and PM2.5 concentrations at the elevated (about 50 m above sea level) GP trail were lower than those at the other two jogging trails. BC and PM2.5 concentrations were generally lower in the night loops (21:30-23:00) than those in the morning loops (07:30-09:00), which coincide with morning rush hours, with only a few exceptions. The difference in geographical locations also affects the BC and PM2.5 concentrations measured, with locations near bus terminals, busy roads, or with congested street canyons having higher concentrations. Doses of BC and PM2.5 after 60 min of exposure during typical jogging exercise are also estimated to evaluate the exposure to PM pollution at these three jogging trails when exercising. The results from the current studies provide information both on personal choice for the time/venue for jogging exercise and on future abatement policy to mitigate such risks of exposure to BC and PM2.5.

AB Permafrost ecosystems play an important role in global climate change, and climate warming would result in permafrost thawing and changing microbial mediated N cycles. Emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) are an important component of N budgets in high-latitude permafrost ecosystems, especially in the context of global climate change. However, few studies have investigated the emissions of N2O from a swamp forest in a permafrost ecosystem. In this paper, we investigated the N2O emissions rates and cumulative budget from continuous permafrost region in the Daxing'an Mountains, northeast China, and identified the key environmental factors affecting N2O emissions from three swamp forests in the growing season. A bootstrapping model estimated that average N2O fluxes during the growing season were 40.76 +/- 6.13, 29.56 +/- 3.21 and 38.27 +/- 8.46 mu g m(-2 )h(-1) from three swamp forests consisting of La be gmelinii - Ledum palustre var. dilatatum (LL), Larix gmelinii - Carex appendiculata (LC) and Betula fruticose - Carex schtmidtii (BC), respectively. The types of swamp forests had no statistically significant impact on N2O emissions (P > 0.05). The cumulative N2O emissions were estimated to be 1.07 +/- 0.09 (LL), 0.79 +/- 0.18 (LC) and 1.05 +/- 0.11 kg ha(-1) (BC) in the swamp forests, indicating that the permafrost region of the Daxing'an Mountains might be a potential N2O source during the growing season. The N2O emissions were mainly controlled by soil temperature, water table level, pH, ammonium nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, total organic carbon and the carbon-to-nitrogen ratio. N2O emission showed significant negative correlation with nitrate nitrogen in the three swamp forests; thus, the low nitrate would limit the rate of N2O emissions in the permafrost region. In addition, we found that denitrification could be the potential source of N2O fluxes in the permafrost region of Daxing'an Mountains. Our results indicated that permafrost swamp forests were significant source for N2O emissions, and N2O emissions were controlled by multiple environmental factors.

AB This study conducted a long-term chloride deposition monitoring at 5 bridges in Da Nang city, Vietnam, by wet candle method with weekly sampling frequency. The monitored records showed prompt changes of chloride deposition in unfavorable weather events such as typhoon, depression. Prior to this long-term monitoring, weekly sampling monitoring was tested by short-term test in Yokohama city. This short-term test showed that the total chloride amount collected by weekly sampling frequency is almost equal to that collected by monthly sampling frequency in a same monitoring period, i.e. it is applicable to conduct aerosol chloride deposition monitoring with weekly sampling frequency. Besides, a new effect analysis of wind on chloride deposition using effective wind power was proposed and applied for long-term monitored data and meteorological data in this study. This new analysis succeeded in constructing the relation function of wind parameters including wind speed and wind direction with chloride deposition with better variance compared to conventional analysis method.

AB The contribution of traffic-related particulate matter (PM2.5, particles smaller than 2.5 mu m in diameter) sources can vary temporally and spatially, which may disproportionately contribute to health outcomes. Furthermore, non-exhaust emissions are a growing concern due to the high concentrations of redox active metals that can be present. The temporal and spatial variabilities of traffic-related PM2.5 sources were investigated in this study by comparing source contributions between two near-road sites. In order to identify local PM2.5 sources with greater temporal and spatial resolution, receptor modeling was performed for hourly-resolved organics, inorganic ions, trace elements, and black carbon in PM2.5 simultaneously measured at downtown and highway sites located within 15 m of a major roadway and highway, respectively, in Toronto. The source apportionment study revealed that traffic-related PM2.5 sources were mainly from exhaust emissions (9%-19% of PM2.5) and non-exhaust emissions including brake wear (2%-6%) and resuspension of road dust (3%-4%). The traffic-related sources exhibited strong diurnal and spatial variabilities, whereas no spatial and temporal differences were observed for the largest PM2.5 contributors, oxidized organic aerosol and secondary sulphate. During morning rush hours, the overall contribution of traffic exhaust and non-exhaust emissions were elevated up to 35%-48% of total PM2.5 mass, which was found to be the largest PM2.5 source at the highway site and the second largest contributor in the downtown area. Furthermore, the contribution of traffic-related sources at the highway site was higher than at the downtown site by a factor of 2-3, suggesting that exposure to traffic-related emissions varies greatly in space and time. Nearly one-third of the traffic-related source contributions were associated with non-exhaust emissions from brake wear and road dust resuspension in the urban environment. Elevated levels of non-exhaust sources were correlated with the number of heavy-duty vehicles, rather than total traffic volume. Although the contribution of brake wear and road dust sources to total PM2.5 mass was relatively low, non-exhaust emissions contributed a substantial fraction of trace elements, especially for Ba (74-79%), Cu (66-71%), and Mn (53-65%) in the urban atmosphere.

AB Platinum (Pt), palladium (Pd) and rhodium (Rh) are accumulating globally in the environment due to their use as catalysts to control automotive exhaust emissions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of emission control measures on the changes in platinum group elements (PGE) concentrations in airborne particulate matter (atmospheric particulate matter of aerodynamic diameter <= 2.5 mu m, PM2.5) during the 2014 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit held in Beijing. Airborne samples were collected from Beijing urban areas with high volumes of traffic. Samples were treated using microwave-assisted digestion procedures, and the concentrations of PGE were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).
   The PGE concentration during the APEC summit decreased by 35.13% and 35.21%, compared with before and after the summit, respectively, which were smaller than the corresponding decreases in the PM2.5 concentrations (similar to 53.9% and 50.5%, respectively). The results provide data regarding PGE accumulation trends in the urban atmospheric environments, which is ascribed to their use as catalysts in automotive catalytic converters. The results highlight the need to continue monitoring the accumulation of PGE, most notably Pd, in the urban atmospheric environment.

AB While emissions from nonroad mobile sources, such as locomotives, have gained increased regulatory scrutiny, a surprisingly few number of real-world, in-use measurements exist. This paper reports the use of a Remote Sensing Device (RSD) to measure emissions from locomotives. This noninvasive technique measured NO and NO2 emissions from individually identified locomotives as their exhaust plumes passed through the sensing beam of the RSD on a bridge directly above the moving sources. NOx emissions from 143 in-use, predominantly line-haul locomotives were measured from two bridges near Tacoma, WA. Locomotive NOx emission factors were within levels reported in previous studies. While there is a 26% difference in certification standards, the real-world NOx measurements reported here found no statistical difference between mean emission factors for Tier 1 and Tier 2 locomotives. With the 2015 implementation of stringent Tier 4 emissions standards, remote sensing of NOx emissions by RSD would provide a useful, real-world, check on the expected in-use NOx reductions.

AB A number of laboratory experimental investigations, field campaigns, and modeling results have emphasized the role of aqueous-phase photochemical reactions in the formation of secondary organic aerosols (SOA). However, investigations focused on aqueous-phase reactions under high ionic-strength conditions are scarce. Here we study the photochemical behavior of a lignin-derived compound, acetosyringone (AcS), upon addition of an inert salt (NaClO4). The increase in the ionic strength modifies the acidic constant of AcS, enhancing its deprotonation. As a consequence, the UV-VIS absorption spectra of AcS undergo modifications due to red shifts at high ionic strength of the electronic transitions n -> pi* (from lambda(max) = 297 nm to lambda(max )= 354 nm) and pi -> pi* (from lambda(max) = 214 nm to lambda(max) = 247 nm). At fixed pH = 4, representative of moderately acidic atmospheric aerosol deliquescent particles, the pseudo-first-order rate constants (k(1st)) of AcS increased by similar to 6 times from a dilute aqueous phase to a solution with an effective ionic strength I-eff, = 0.46 M. The rate constant then followed a saturation trend at elevated ionic strength up to I-eff. = 3.1 M. A similar saturation effect of the observed rate constants with ionic strength was observed in presence of NaCl and Na2SO4. Differential absorption spectroscopy (DAS) methodology was applied to examine the changes in absorption spectra of AcS upon prolonged light irradiation. The very subtle pH-induced changes of the absorption spectra of irradiated AcS are due to the formation of acidic compounds emerged upon photochemical transformation of AcS.

AB Formation of organic aerosol (OA) and ozone were simulated for the greater Houston area in September 2013 and 2028 (summer conditions) using the Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions (CAMx). We also simulated the background concentrations in the absence of US anthropogenic emissions. The 1.5-dimensional volatility basis set scheme was used to represent formation of primary and secondary OA (POA and SOA). The path-integral method for source apportionment was successfully extended to OA formation using the same numerical approach previously used for ozone and then applied to apportion the anthropogenic increment of OA and ozone to six emission source categories. The anthropogenic increment is the difference between the 2013 or 2028 simulation and the background simulation. Averaged over 21 air monitoring sites in Houston, point sources make the largest contribution to monthly average SOA and OA (25%-37%, depending on year) and to monthly maximum 8-h ozone (21%-26%). Onroad and then nonroad sources are the next most important in 2013, but their contributions diminish by 2028. The sources' contributions to SOA correlate much more strongly with their NOx emissions than with their emissions of organic precursor species. Anthropogenic emissions enhance OA formation from biogenic emissions, and this enhancement is 46% and 48% of the total OA concentration in Houston in 2013 and 2028, respectively. Point sources make the largest contribution to the enhancement. Additional results for a larger regional area covering Texas and nearby states are also presented.

AB AirGIS, a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) based air pollution and human exposure modelling system, is routinely used in conjunction with the Operational Street Pollution Model (OSPM center dot), across the globe, to assess local- or street-scale air pollution. We developed a substantially revised version of AirGIS (hereafter, new AirGIS) as a new modelling system in open-source GIS i.e. PostgreSQL software with its spatial extension PostGIS to (1) optimize the model performance enabling model calculations for a large number of sites over a large geographical area, with limited computing resources (2) replace the outdated programming language Avenue (3) become independent of commercial GIS software. This paper, therefore, aims to describe the overall structure of new AirGIS modelling system together with its strengths and limitations. Furthermore, the new AirGIS has been evaluated against various measured datasets of ambient air pollution (NOx, NO2, PM10 and PM2.5). In terms of reproducing temporal variation (single location, time series of concentrations e.g. annual, daily etc.) of air pollution, the new model achieved correlations (R) in the range 0.45-0.96. While, in terms of reproducing the spatial variation (several locations, single time interval), the new AirGIS achieved correlations in the range 0.32-0.92. The new model, therefore, can be used for both short- and long-term air pollution exposure assessments to facilitate health related studies. However, the present evaluation of the new modelling system also revealed that the new AirGIS significantly overestimated the observed concentrations for two out of four datasets. The possible reasons for these errors and future directions to reducing the bias in the new model output have been discussed.

AB A comprehensive overview is provided evaluating direct real-world CO2 emissions of both diesel and petrol cars newly registered in Europe between 1995 and 2015. Before 2011, European diesel cars emitted less CO2 per kilometre than petrol cars, but since then there is no appreciable difference in per-km CO2 emissions between diesel and petrol cars. Real-world CO2 emissions of diesel cars have not declined appreciably since 2001, while the CO2 emissions of petrol cars have been stagnant since 2012. When adding black carbon related CO2 equivalents, such as from diesel cars without particulate filters, diesel cars were discovered to have had much higher climate relevant emissions until the year 2001 when compared to petrol cars. From 2001 to 2015 CO2 equivalent emissions from new diesel cars and petrol cars were hardly distinguishable. Lifetime use phase CO2 equivalent emissions of all European passenger vehicles were modelled for 1995-2015 based on three scenarios: the historic case, another scenario freezing percentages of diesel cars at the low levels from the early 1990s (thus avoiding the observed "boom" in new diesel registrations), and an advanced mitigation scenario based on high proportions of petrol hybrid cars and cars burning gaseous fuels. The difference in CO2-equivalent emissions between the historical case and the scenario avoiding the diesel car boom is only 0.4%. The advanced mitigation scenario would have been able to achieve a 3.4% reduction in total CO2-equivalent emissions over the same time frame. The European diesel car boom appears to have been ineffective at reducing climate-warming emissions from the European transport sector.

AB Oxalic acid is the most abundant dicarboxylic acid in the atmosphere, but the processes involved in its formation in ambient aerosols are still uncertainty. We used single particle aerosol mass spectrometer to investigate the sources and formation mechanisms of oxalic acid-containing (C-2) particles in ambient aerosols in Chengdu during summer and winter seasons. C-2 particles accounted for 2.9 and 0.7% of the total amount of fine particles detected in summer and winter, respectively. The C-2 particles in each season were classified as nine different types of particle with significant seasonal differences in their contribution to total C-2 particles. The oxalic acid-sulfate (C-2 -SO4) particles and particles related to biomass burning (i.e., oxalic acid-organic nitrogen (C-2-CN) and oxalic acid-elemental carbon (C-2 -EC)) represented 78% of the total C-2 particles in summer, whereas the contributions of oxalic acid-dust (C-2-D), oxalic acid-sulfate and nitrate (C-2-SN), and oxalic acid-nitrate (C-2 -NO3) particles clearly increased in winter. Although the peak diameter of the average size distribution of total C-2 particles was larger in winter than in summer, there was no significant seasonal difference in the number fraction of the size-resolved particles for each type of particle. The peak concentration of total C-2 particle in summer occurred in the afternoon, but there was no obvious diurnal variation in winter. We concluded that local photochemical oxidation in the daytime favored the production of C-2 particles in summer, whereas in-cloud processing with subsequent long-distance transport had an important effect on C-2 particles in winter. The potential source contribution function (PSCF) analysis indicated that local sources from the eastern, southeastern, and southern regions of Sichuan Province dominated the C-2 particles in summer, whereas the contribution from the long-distance transport of aerosols originating outside Sichuan Province was significantly enhanced in winter. These findings will help us to understand the formation of secondary organic aerosols in the atmosphere over the Sichuan Basin.

AB The chemical characterization of PM2.5 was conducted at 5 rural background sites in France for the year 2013. Chemical analysis of daily samples every sixth day included the measurements of organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC), ionic species and several specific primary and secondary organic tracers such as levoglucosan, polyols, methane sulfonic acid (MSA) and oxalate. The sampling sites were spatially distributed in order to be representative of the French atmospheric background. The results showed well identified temporal variations common to all the 5 sampling sites, covering a large fraction of France. During winter, concentrations of the biomass burning marker levoglucosan are significantly increased with high synchronous temporal pattern, indicating the strong impact of this source at a regional scale. During summer, concentrations of primary biogenic markers such as polyols (arabitol, mannitol) increase due to higher biological activities while oxalate contributions to OC also increases, attributed to ageing processes. The sources of primary organic aerosol are investigated using mono-tracer approaches based on these compounds. Results indicate that the relative contributions of wood burning to OC are very high, reaching an average value of 90% during winter for some of the rural sites. Terrestrial primary biogenic organic fraction is significant in summer and fall with a monthly contribution ranging from 4.5 to 9.5% of OC in PM2.5. A synchronous increase is also observed for secondary organic tracers (MSA, oxalic acid) during warm period confirming the influence on the large scale of these compounds that can account for 10-20% and 5-7% of the OC mass, respectively.

AB The Eastern Mediterranean (EM) Basin is exposed to frequent dust storms during all seasons but summer. The dust is originating from two large sources: a western source, namely North African (mainly Sahara Desert) and an eastern source, the Arabian Peninsula.
   The characteristics of 53 dust storms (2007-2013) were examined in relation to their origin - western (30) vs. eastern (23). Analysis was done using ground monitoring stations, satellite data and subjective synoptic classification. Significantly higher ground concentration (722 mu g/m(3) for western events vs 242 mu g/m(3) for eastern events), higher Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT) levels (0.50 for western events vs 0.32 for eastern events), longer duration (25 h for western events vs 15 h for eastern events) and stronger surface wind speed (6 m/s for western events vs 4 m/s for eastern events) were found for western origin dust storms. Dust top height was higher for eastern origin events (1.7 km for western events vs 2.3 km for eastern events, non significant). The associated synoptic circulation types dominant during the western origin dust storms are winter cold-core cyclones while for the eastern origin events the Red Sea Trough is the dominant type and occur mainly during fall.
   The main assumed reasons for these distinguished characteristics (higher ground concentration, AOT levels, longer duration, and surface wind speed) are that western origin cyclones can induce both mobilization and transport of dust. Together with longer dust path and local sources contribution will create a potential for high concentration and long-lasting event as compared to eastern origin events where there is a separation between main mobilization process that occur during summer and the transport westwards necessary to deliver dust to the EM and occurs during non-summer events.

AB Alpine and subalpine ecosystems on Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau are rich in soil organic carbon and are among the most sensitive regions to climate change, while little is known about the dynamics of soil carbon dioxide (CO2 ) in alpine/subalpine ecosystems except for the grassland on the plateau. In this study, the monthly and inter-annual variations in soil CO2 emission from a subalpine coniferous forest and a subalpine shrubland ecosystem on the eastern edge of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau were investigated from 2012 to 2015 using the opaque steady-state chamber method. Soil CO2 flux rate during the growing season ranged from 153.3 to 683.6 mg m(- 2) h(-1) in the coniferous forest, being twice of that (76.6-347.3 mg m(-2) h(-1)) in the shrubland, due to the elevation-induced differences in soil temperature and water content and the vegetation-induced differences in soil carbon and nitrogen pools. Both ecosystems showed large monthly variations in soil CO2 flux rate, while relative to the coniferous forest, the shrubland had a less inter-annual variation in soil CO2 emission. The two ecosystems had the same temperature sensitivity of soil CO2 emission, which suggests that they will respond similarly to global warming concerning soil CO2 flux rate. The results highlight the importance of soil CO2 emission in subalpine forest and shrubland ecosystems, which can be helpful to reduce the uncertainty of regional estimates of carbon budget in subalpine regions under global warming.

AB The atmospheric chemistry of perfluoronitriles, the proposed replacement gases of SF6, has been investigated using an atmospheric reaction chamber. N2O formation was first observed following the reaction between perfluoronitriles and OH radicals, then NO formation was verified through experimentation. COF2, CF3C(O)F, and CO2 generation was observed, and a revised oxidation mechanism for perfluoronitriles in the atmosphere is proposed. Additionally, the rate coefficients related to OH radicals were measured for the perfluoronitriles of CF3CN, CF3CF2CN, CF3CF2CF2CN, and (CF3)(2)CFCN: their atmospheric lifetimes were 6.6, 10, 12, and 54 years, their radiative efficiencies were evaluated to be 0.188, 0.223, 0.317, and 0.231 W m(-2) ppb(-1), and their 100-year time horizon GWPs were 212, 374, 633, and 1705, respectively. The findings contained in this study indicate that perfluoronitriles present an insulating gas replacement option with a comparatively low environmental impact.

AB Source apportionment of PM2.5 was performed using positive matrix factorization (PMF) based on chemical composition data from 24-h filters collected throughout the year of 2015 at two sites in Macao (TG and PE), where TG is a general station and PE is near the city's ferry terminal. The input data sets include major inorganic ions, organic carbon and elemental carbon, elements and organic tracers (non-polar organic compounds and sugar compounds). Eight factors were resolved, namely, (1) secondary sulfate formation process, (2) secondary nitrate formation process, (3) biomass burning, (4) industrial emissions, (5) residual oil combustion, (6) sea salt, (7) dust, and (8) vehicle + helicopter emissions. Among the resolved sources, secondary sulfate and secondary nitrate were the major PM2.5 contributors, contributing to 33% and 23% of PM2.5 mass annually. Vehicle + helicopter emissions contributed to 12%, followed by industrial emissions (10%). Back trajectory analysis and conditional probability function (CPF) analysis were performed on the PMF-resolved factor contributions to distinguish the local and regional sources. Industrial emissions and vehicle + helicopter emissions showed different air mass impact at the two sites. The CPF plots confirmed the site differences in the resolved vehicle + helicopter emissions and industrial emissions were consistent with the geographical features of Macao and known local emission sources. The role of organic tracers was examined by comparing PMF runs with and without the inclusion of organics, denoted PMForg and PMFt, respectively. The results showed that the same set of contributing sources were resolved while noticeable differences of absolute PM2.5 contributions were observed between PMForg and PMFt and lower mass closure was noted for PMFt. PMF runs without source indicative organic tracers tend to produce higher estimations of source contributions from biomass burning and vehicle exhaust factors than that with the organics while underestimate secondary nitrate, industrial emissions, and dust. This work highlights the importance of organic tracers in achieving more accurate source apportionment.

AB Explosive volcanic eruptions can inject large amounts of ash and gases into the atmosphere. Such volcanic aerosols can have a significant impact on the surrounding environment, and there is the need to closely investigate their effects on meteorology on local, regional, and even continental scale. This work presents a study of the 2010 Eyjafjallajokull volcanic eruption the resulting ash dispersion and its radiative feedback effects on the meteorological conditions with the Weather Research Forecasting model with on-line Chemistry (WRF-Chem). Two model runs, one meteorology-only simulation (without chemistry) and one that considers gas- and aerosol chemistry as well as direct- and semidirect aerosol feedbacks were performed and compared. Results for daily values show that aerosol radiative feedback effects can cool the atmosphere close to the surface on average by 1 degrees C with maximum cooling exceeding even 2 degrees C for the considered episode. Near-surface atmospheric wind speed changed on average by 0.5 m/s with maximum values above 2 m/s. Furthermore, the presence of ash aerosols affected the vertical shape of the profiles of wind speed and temperature and resulted in a better agreement with radiosonde measurements when radiative feedback effects were considered. Although the modeling of the dispersion of volcanic ash clouds is subject to large uncertainties, we have demonstrated that the WRF-Chem model can reproduce observations at surface levels and vertical profiles more realistically when radiative feedback effects are considered in the simulations.

AB To evaluate the influence of the implementation of emission reduction measures on air quality during the 2015 China Victory Day Parade, the characteristics of organic aerosols in particulate matter with a diameter less than 2.5 gm (PM2.5) were analyzed from 11 August to 10 September 2015 in Beijing, China. The average concentration of PM2.5 decreased by 64% during the 2015 China Victory Day Parade compared with that before the event. Local emissions were the main PM2.5 sources during the 2015 China Victory Day Parade; cooking and traffic emission were two significant contributors. During the 2015 China Victory Day Parade, the average concentrations of levoglucosan and dehydroabietic acid decreased by 31% and 12%, respectively, indicating the significant effects of regional air pollution controls on air quality. 17 alpha(H), 21 beta(H)-30-Norhopane and 17 alpha(H), 21 beta(H)-hopane concentrations decreased continuously throughout the entire study period, suggesting the significant effect of the "odd-even" traffic restrictions implemented. Similarly, o-phthalic acid, succinic acid, and 2,3-dihydroxy-4-oxopentanoic acid (DPA) concentrations also significantly decreased during the Parade, with reductions of 63, 50, and 61%, respectively, compared with before the event. Photochemical oxidation played an important role in the formation of o-phthalic acid, while the formation of DPA was influenced by both photochemical oxidation and liquid-phase chemical reactions. The lung cancer risk, caused by inhalation exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, to the exposed populations decreased by 40% during the 2015 China Victory Day Parade, the enhanced control measures implemented during Parade Blue would also have positive influence on the human health.

AB In this study we investigated the respective contributions of changing meteorology and anthropogenic emissions to Hg wet deposition in New York State (NYS), which illustrated quantitatively how the variations in meteorological conditions modified the response of Hg wet deposition to anthropogenic emission reductions in NYS. A regional chemical transport model, CMAQ-newHg-Br (Ye et al., 2018), was employed driven by four sets of meteorological fields (2004, 2005, 2007, and 2010) and two anthropogenic emission inventories (NEI, 2005 and 2011). Four major findings emerged from this study. First, simulated Hg wet deposition flux in NYS was greatly affected by variation in meteorological conditions, ranging from a 91% decrease to a factor of 5 increase in monthly Hg wet deposition, whereas it hardly responded (2%) to a near doubling of emissions in the northeastern U.S. Second, the precipitation amount dominated interannual and seasonal variations of Hg wet deposition over all other meteorological variables, with total (= convective + non-convective) precipitation explained 60% of Hg wet deposition variance in an urban environment compared to convective precipitation alone explaining 65% in a rural area. Third, large-scale atmospheric circulation influenced regional transport greatly leading to out-of-state anthropogenic emissions explaining at least 80% of Hg wet deposition changes in a NYS urban environment. Fourth, higher Hg concentrations in precipitation and higher atmospheric reactive mercury concentrations in urban areas were related to calm conditions due likely to regional build-up of emissions, whereas in rural areas photochemical oxidation of gaseous elemental mercury was a more important source of reactive mercury. Solar radiation variance was found to explain 41-55% of the variance in simulated reactive mercury concentrations. Given that more than 95% of the US is rural lands and the majority of water bodies occur in rural areas, a realistic chemical mechanism for photochemical gaseous elemental mercury oxidation is paramount to accurate simulation of reactive mercury formation and Hg wet deposition in the US.

AB In this study, a high-resolution simulation of fossil fuel CO2 in Beijing and surrounding areas, China, during January 2014 is performed to investigate the characteristics and sources of Beijing fossil fuel CO2 (FFCO2) mixing ratios and the impact of regional transport. The model reasonably reproduces the observed meteorological fields in the study domain, including temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and wind direction. The simulated CO2 and CO mixing ratios in Beijing are in good agreement with the measurements. Elevated FFCO2 levels are produced by the model in megacities, such as Beijing, Tianjin, Shijiazhuang, and Baoding. The model result shows that FFCO2 mixing ratios are significantly correlated with observed total CO2, CO, and PM2.5 concentrations in Beijing. Sensitivity experiments show that Beijing FFCO2 is mainly from industry and residential emissions (35% for each), followed by power plant (21%) and transportation (9%) emissions in January 2014. Spatially, the largest contributor for Beijing FFCO2 is the local source, and regional transport also plays an important role in winter. The impact of regional transport is associated with wind direction, in which south/east (north/west) wind tends to accumulate (dilute) Beijing FFCO2. In addition, the roles of regional transport during haze and clean episodes are significantly distinct in winter, and more contribution is found in haze episodes.

AB We apply the regional chemistry-transport model WRF-Chem to investigate the air pollution characteristics in three Chinese metropolitan areas (Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou) and assess the model performance in wintertime (January 2010) and summertime (July 2010) conditions. Three simulations utilizing the HTAPv2, REASv2 and MACCity anthropogenic emission inventories are conducted and compared with satellite and ground-based measurements to assess the sensitivity of the model predictions to anthropogenic emissions. Model-predicted surface meteorological fields are overall in good agreement with surface observations. However, the model tends to overestimate maximum surface wind speed, a feature also found in previous WRF-Chem modelling studies. Large discrepancies between the three emission inventories are found, specifically in the spatial distribution and the magnitude of the emissions (e.g. over 98%, 86% and 85% differences in some regions for carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxide (NO) and organic carbon (OC) emissions, respectively). As a result, we find large differences between the simulations. When compared to satellite and surface observations, the HTAPv2-and REASv2-based simulations better reproduce the magnitude and spatial patterns of CO total columns and NO2 tropospheric columns derived from MOPITTv6 and GOME2 satellite observations, respectively. The simulations satisfactorily reproduce the air pollution characteristics in January 2010 as observed at surface monitoring stations in Beijing and Shanghai. The HTAPv2-based simulation better captures the pollution episode that occurred in Beijing in mid-January 2010, which is found to be related to a combination of different meteorological factors that led to the build-up of pollution. The high photochemical activity and convective turbulence in July 2010, in addition to differences in the emissions used, led to more pronounced differences between the simulations and lower statistical skills in particular for trace gases.
   This study shows that a considerable part of uncertainties in air quality model predictions for China can be attributed to uncertainties in current anthropogenic emission inventories. It highlights the need for more accurate and highly resolved emissions in order to improve the accuracy of model predictions. However, this study reveals that in some cases, model-observation discrepancies cannot be attributed only to inaccuracies in the emissions. For example, we found that regardless of the adopted emissions, all of the simulations fail to capture the temporal variability of particulate matter in Guangzhou during January 2010, indicating that factors other than emissions have a considerable influence on the atmospheric composition in this region. This work shows that inaccuracies in the predicted meteorological parameters (e.g. wind speed/direction, relative humidity, etc.) significantly affect the model performance, as found for example in the model predictions for Shanghai for July 2010, which show high and abrupt increases of NOx and particulates due to rapid decreases in wind speed in the model.

AB A comparative cross sectional study was conducted in order to analyze the pollutants (CO, NOx, SO2, O-3, VOC and PM) present in the event of Lahore smog that was observed on 2-5 Nov 2016 in relation to the baseline condition of the ambient air measured during the same period in the previous year i.e. 2015. The effect of smog was determined based on ocular surface diseases reported by patients, using data' taken from tertiary care hospitals during the 2-3 November 2016 Lahore smog. The data was compared with that from the previous year (2-3 November 2015) being considered as baseline. For analysis of the smog and its comparison with baseline conditions, three sites were selected within Lahore city i.e. Mall Road, Gulberg and Township. The AQI for these sites were determined with the analysis of ambient air that was done through USEPA approved reference methods. The data on the number of patients having ocular surface diseases due to smog were collected from tertiary care hospitals i.e. Shiekh Zaid and Mayo Hospitals which were randomly selected. The clinical method used has been implicitly elaborated and it has been explained very clearly how all the clinical diagnoses were executed. The highest concentration of pollutant analyzed during smog was that of NOx which was almost 17 times higher than the baseline value. The other pollutants SO2 and O-3 were four times, CO, VOC and PM2.5 two times and PM10 was six times higher than the baseline value. Although the values of SO2 and PM2.5 were greater than the baseline values they did not exceed the Pakistan Environmental Quality Standards (PEQS) limits. The Air Quality Index- AQI was found to be six times higher than the baseline which represents a very poor air quality during smog days. The metrological conditions during the smog event were cool temperatures, calm winds and high humidity that ultimately triggered the photochemical reaction which caused the smog. The data taken from hospitals revealed that out of 700 patients 200 were reported in 2015 and 500 were reported in 2016 with diseases including dry eyes (12%) and (13%), irritation (20%) and (21%), lid erosion (4%) and (5%), corneal diseases (7%) and (8%),uveitis (3%) and (4%) and lacrimation (11%) and (7%) respectively. The study ultimately revealed that there was a 60% increase in the number of patients reported with ocular surface diseases (dry eyes, irritation, lid erosion, comeal diseases, conjunctival diseases, uveitis, and lacrimation) during periods of smog as compared to baseline conditions.

AB Sea spray aerosol particle is a dominating part of the global aerosol mass load of natural origin. Thus, it strongly influences the atmospheric radiation balance and cloud properties especially over the oceans. Uncertainties of the estimated climate impacts by this aerosol type are partly caused by the uncertainties in the particle size dependent emission fluxes of sea spray aerosol particle. We present simulations with a regional aerosol transport model system in two domains, for three months and compared the model results to measurements at four stations using various sea spray aerosol particle source source functions. Despite these limitations we found the results using different source functions are within the range of most model uncertainties. Especially the model's ability to produce realistic wind speeds is crucial. Furthermore, the model results are more affected by a function correcting the emission flux for the effect of the sea surface temperature than by the use of different source functions.

AB Air pollution has emerged as a key environmental issue of Pakistan as its major cities are ranked among top polluted cities in the South Asian region. Due to lack of adequate ground-based monitoring facilities, satellite observations are the only viable source for long-term assessment of air quality over the region. This study analyses the atmospheric concentrations and decadal changes derived from multiple satellite instruments of four important tropospheric trace gases over Pakistan: surface concentrations of carbon monoxide (CO), tropospheric columns of formaldehyde (HCHO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O-3). High levels of all these trace gases were observed over Punjab region, which may be attributed to its metropolitan importance. It is the major agricultural, industrialized and urbanized region of the country. Seasonal Mann-Kendall (SMK) test is used to calculate the statistical significance of temporal trend during the last decade (2005-2014). Surface CO showed a significant decrease of about 13 +/- 1% over the decade. Tropospheric column ozone (O-3) exhibited a significant increasing trend with a temporal increase of 10.4 +/- 1.2%/decade whereas NO2 showed a significant temporal increase of about 28 +/- 2%/decade. However, an insignificant increase of about 8.3 +/- 0.3%/decade is estimated for HCHO over the decade. A distinct seasonal behaviour is observed among trace gases. The long-term relationship among trace gases is further explored by statistical tests. It is found that O-3, NO2 and HCHO have a significant impact on the long-term decrease of CO whereas; the trend in O-3 critically depends on NO2 levels along with CO over the region. A statistical model is developed to estimate the long-term association of trace gases over the region. The model indicates that O-3 production may have major influence on decrease of CO over Pakistan in a (volatile organic compound) VOC-limited regime.

AB The accidental or malicious release of toxic substances in the urban atmosphere is a major environmental and safety problem, especially in large cities. Computational fluid dynamics codes and simplified modelling tools have been used in the last decades to model pollutant dispersion in urban areas. These studies have shown that propagation is strongly influenced by the layout of buildings and, therefore, by the street topology of the city. This work presents a novel approach to the study of toxic propagation within the urban canopy based on the theory of complex networks. The urban canopy is modelled as a network, where the streets and the street intersections represent respectively the links and the nodes of the network. The direction and the weights of the links contain the geometrical characteristics of the street canyons and their wind conditions, so that all the key variables involved in pollutant dispersion are represented in a single mathematical structure that is a weighted and directed complex network. Thanks to this mathematical interpretation, propagation is modelled as a spreading process on a network and a depth-first search algorithm is used to rapidly delimit the zone of influence of a source node. This zone is the set of streets that are contaminated from the source. As a case study, the proposed model is applied to the urban tissue of the city of Lyon. The algorithm simulates a toxic release in all the nodes of the network and computes the number of people affected by each propagation process. In this way, the nodes with the most dangerous spreading potential are identified and vulnerability maps of the city are constructed. Moreover, various wind and concentration scenarios are easily implemented. The results highlight how the proposed method is effective in assessing the most vulnerable points in a city with a computational time that is up to three orders of magnitude lower than that of existing models. Moreover, the proposed approach paves the way to future applications of tools and metrics from the complex network theory for a deeper comprehension of the mechanisms that drive pollutant dispersion in urban areas.

AB Combined Pb-Sr-Nd isotopes tracing technique with positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis was used for source apportionment of metal elements in PM2.5 from Xiamen city, a coastal city in Southeast China. The results showed that the mean concentration of metal elements in PM2.5 in winter was 51.92% higher than that in summer. The air-mass backward trajectory analysis suggested that PM2.5 in Xiamen was significantly influenced by local sources during the sampling period. According to our study, metal elements in PM2.5 were mainly from plating and alloy industry and coal combustion, followed by soil and construction dusts, while traffic exhausts played a minor role. The carcinogenic risk value to human of Cr, Co, Ni and Cd, which mainly came from plating and alloy industry and soil and construction dusts, were exceeded the safe value (10(-6)), indicating the relative control measures should be taken for the above elements in PM2.5.

AB The localization of a source emitting gas to the outdoor atmosphere has many applications for air quality monitoring and chemical hazard mitigation. Chemical Plume Tracing (CPT) refers to the utilization of autonomous robotic platforms equipped with chemical and anemometry sensors to preform this task. Numerical simulations are an important tool in the development of CPT algorithms. Here, for the first time, high fidelity environmental simulations of the Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ABL) are utilized for the study of CPT algorithm. Large Eddy Simulation (LES) modeling using the PALM model is applied for producing high-resolution three-dimensional flow and dispersion simulations of the outdoor ABL. A CPT bio-inspired algorithm is simulated on top of the modeled environment. Multiple tests are conducted, following statistical analysis of the overall performance. The advantage of the suggested modeling framework over former used methods is exemplified through the study of two issues. First, a theoretical optimal velocity of the robotic platform is quantitatively estimated. Secondly, based on the three-dimensional nature of LES modeling, an extension of the CPT algorithm, aimed for the localization of elevated sources, is presented and tested. The comparison of CPT performance for elevated versus ground sources reveals the considerable difficulty involved in tracing an elevated plume.

AB Pollen allergy has become a major problem for a considerable and steadily increasing percentage of people worldwide. Allergenic protein, which is contained in subpollens, can be released from pollen and suspended in air to cause allergenic reactions. However, the distribution of the allergenic protein and its relationship with inorganic ions in ambient particles has not been reported. Here, a recombinant Platanus acerifolia allergen3 and tandemsix-histidine epitope (His(6)) fusion protein (rPla a3) was expressed in a prokaryotic system and then purified by affinity chromatography. The allergenicity of both rPla a3 and natural Pla a3 in Platanus pollen protein extract was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using the sera of rPla a3-sensitized rats. Our results demonstrated that IgE from rPla a3-sensitized rats could be used to quantify the allergenicity of Pla a3 in the released Platanus pollen and identify the mass level of Pla 3 in size-resolved particles. The peak of natural Pla a3 expression was found in the middle of April, and the highest mass level of Pla a3 occurred in ambient particles diameters larger than 7 mu m. The mass concentration of Pla a3 in the atmosphere was consistent with that of the total protein variety, which also showed a peak in particles with diameters larger than 7 mu m during the Platanus pollen season. Remarkably, most Pla a3 existed in particulate matters > 7 mu m, including intact Platanus pollen, and non-negligible partitions of Pla a3 were detected in particles with diameters less than 7.0 mu m. Major ions (Ca2+, NH4+, and SO42-) in ambient particles not only aggravated pollen rupture and content release, but also affected the distribution of Pla 3 in the particles. Allergic disease could be specifically identified by using rPla a3, and there was a short lag between hospital admission for allergic disease and the peak of Platanus protein concentration in spring.

AB Atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition in terrestrial ecosystems is difficult to quantify, especially in forests. In this study, we compared three approaches for determining the wet and dry deposition of nitrogen (total deposition) at 17 intensively monitored forest sites in Switzerland. Specifically, we considered approaches based on: 1) measurements of bulk deposition and throughfall in 2014 (throughfall method); 2) measurements of bulk deposition and measurements of air concentrations of ammonia (NH3) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), to which deposition velocities were applied, also in 2014 (inferential method); and 3) a model developed for Switzerland at a high spatial resolution, run for the five-year period 2013-2017 (emission based model). In addition, changes over two decades were assessed using continuous measurements of throughfall and bulk deposition. Further, air concentrations of NH3 and NO2 measured in 2014 were compared with concentrations measured in 2000 at 10 of the sites. The three approaches generally yielded comparable estimates of total deposition, with some notable differences at some sites. For both the model and the inferential method, uncertainties were related to the deposition velocities that were applied to air concentrations of N compounds, especially for NH3. The throughfall method provided a minimum estimate of the total N deposition in the forest, but the fraction of the deposited N that is directly taken up by the canopy remained difficult to quantify. Nitrogen deposition has decreased since the mid-1990s at the majority of the sites. However, deposition of the reduced forms of N seems to have stagnated at the local level. Furthermore, N deposition is still too high in comparison with the range of empirical critical loads of N (CLN). The minimum deposition estimated from throughfall exceeds the lower limit of CLN at all sites except those in the Central Alps. Deposition estimated with the model and the inferential method exceeds the lower limit of CLN at all sites and even exceeds the upper limit at several locations.

AB Coastal regions are frequently subject to higher concentrations of ozone (O-3) than areas farther inland due to thermally-direct recirculation (e.g., sea/bay breezes) of pollutants during summer months. Along with high O-3 concentrations on polluted days, a bay breeze (in this case, the Chesapeake Bay breeze) causes low-level convergence over the land, which can lead to deep convection even on days without any large-scale convective forcing, altering both the local flow pattern and the concentrations and distributions of pollutants. Presented here is a bay breeze and thunderstorm climatology for Edgewood, MD, a coastal site along the Chesapeake Bay, from June, July, and August 2011-2016 between 11 and 19 EST (UTC-5). Using meteorological data from the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE), bay breezes are identified by an automated detection algorithm, the Bay-breeze Identification Algorithm (BIA), customized for the complex coastline of river inlets within the Chesapeake Bay area. Additionally, thunderstorm vs. non-thunderstorm days are analyzed using gridded Earth Networks lightning data (ENTLN) within an influential radius of the site. The effects of bay breezes and deep convection on local O-3 is quantified, The highest daily conditional mean O-3 for all years was observed on bay breeze days, and the lowest on days with thunderstorms only (no bay breeze). Additionally, 39% of O-3 exceedance days within the analysis time period were also bay breeze days. However, as ozone precursor emissions have fallen, the relationship between bay breezes and high O-3 has diminished. While days with thunderstorms only (no bay breeze) were associated with the lowest daily mean O-3, there were O-3 events on some thunderstorm days, especially if there was also a bay breeze. Twenty-four percent of the total ozone exceedance days had a thunderstorm, demonstrating that thunderstorm days should not be assumed to be clean days, as boundary-layer venting and downdraft mixing depends on the thunderstorm duration and type (e.g., non-frontal/pop-up convection allowed slightly higher O-3 concentrations than did frontal convection). These results illustrate the significant role that localized meteorological events that are difficult to predict play in modulating air pollution where many of the world's cities lie - near bodies of water.

AB A bin chemistry scheme was developed to study sulfate production and the effect of aqueous chemistry on cloud microphysics in precipitating stratocumulus cloud using a 2D kinematical model. The impact of air pollution on aerosol processing was investigated by a comprehensive sensitivity study. The numerical simulations were carried out at different concentrations of condensation nuclei and trace gases of SO2, H2O2, O-3 and NH3. The results show: (i) Significant amount of sulfate formed due to cloud chemistry even in less polluted atmosphere. The amount of sulfate formed due to the oxidation of S(IV) was affected less by the initial condensation nuclei (hereinafter: CN) concentration and more by the initial mixing ratio of gases in the atmosphere. The amount of sulfate staying in the atmosphere was affected by the initial CN concentration, because it impacted the efficiency of washout. (ii) The aqueous sulfate production impacts the characteristics of aerosol size distribution by increasing mean size and by increasing the concentration of the micron size aerosol particles. The change of aerosol size distribution due to sulfate production has no effect on the amount of surface precipitation if the CN concentration is low (100 cm(-3)), and significantly reduces accumulated surface precipitation if CN concentration is large (540 cm(-3)). (iii) Compared to the bin chemistry scheme the bulk chemistry scheme underestimates the sulfate production and overestimates the role of O-3 in the sulfate production.

AB Radiocarbon (C-14) analysis is a powerful tool that can unambiguously distinguish fossil and non-fossil sources of carbonaceous particles. However, one of the big challenges of this method is to isolate elemental carbon (EC) or black carbon (BC) for C-14 analysis. Hydropyrolysis (hypy) has proven to be an effective method for separating BC in environmental matrices. The potential of hypy for isolation of EC from atmospheric aerosols is evaluated using typical combustion products from non-fossil (biomass), fossil fuel (coal and petroleum), and ambient aerosol samples collected in Beijing and Guangzhou. Using solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) along with measurement of carbon content and C-14, hypy conditions of 15 MPa hydrogen pressure and 550 degrees C temperature was confirmed to effectively separate EC from aerosol samples. Consequently, a comparison study of EC C-14 in aerosol samples separated using the two-step heating method (CTO-375), thermal-optical method and hypy was conducted. The results show that hypy is an effective and stable approach for matrix-independent C-14 quantification of EC in aerosols.

AB Source apportionment studies have been performed on online receptor datasets in recent years (called online source apportionment), including mass spectra and online chemical dataset. Single particle aerosol mass spectrometry (SPAMS), an important online technique, has the ability to analyze mass spectrum (MS) and particular size information of a single particle in real time. Clustering methods have been widely applied to MS dataset to investigate the sources of particles, although the receptor models are the common tools to probe the particle sources based on the receptor dataset. This work developed a new method (SPANS-FtM) that employed the receptor model (RM) on an MS dataset from SPAMS to identify particle sources. Particles were measured by SPAMS from July 14 to August 15, 2015, at an urban site in Tianjin, China. Multilinear Engine-2 (ME2) and adaptive resonance theory-based neural networks-2a (ART-2a) were separately used to analyze the single particle MS dataset. This work also evaluated the performance of SPAMS-RM method. Concentrations of chemical components of PM2.5 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 2.5 mu m) and gaseous pollutants were measured by independent online instruments (1 h resolution). Source apportionment was separately conducted using two receptor models, Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) and ME2, based on the 1 h resolution chemical dataset. This method was called online chemical source apportionment (OCSA-RM). ART-2a obtained 19 clusters that merged into five major classes: carbon species, rich-K, sea salt, crustal dust, and industrial metals. SPAMS-RM identified eight sources by interpreting the MS characteristic of factors and investigating the relationship of the temporal trends of factor contributions, chemical species, gaseous pollutants, and particle clusters. OCSA-ME2 and OCSA-PMF both identified seven factors. Source apportionment results between SPAMS-RM and OCSA-ME2/PMF were compared. Each method identified coal combustion, biomass burning, sea salt, nitrate source, sulfate source, vehicle emission, and crustal dust. The SPAMS-RM results showed that nitrate source was the most significant contributor (34%) to the PM followed by sulfate source (17%), coal combustion (14%), crustal dust (11%), vehicle emission (10%), biomass burning-OCEC (7%), and industrial activities & sea salt (4%). Some differences between SPAMS-RM and OCSA-ME2/PMF results existed and might be due to chemical analysis methods and sampling methods. ME2 was used for the first time to identify the PM sources based on the MS dataset from SPAMS and demonstrated its capability when coupled with MS dataset from SPAMS to apportion the source of PM.

AB The Daesan industrial complex is one of the largest petrochemical and oil refinery industrial complexes in South Korea, which is believed to be a major source of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Total suspended particle (TSP) samples (n = 84) were seasonally collected at two industrial sites and one residential site, and 19 PAHs were analyzed. Concentrations of individual PAHs ranged from 0.01 to 2.52 ng/m(3), and annual mean concentrations of Sigma(19) PAHs at Sites 1, 2, and 3 were 5.88, 4.52, and 5.08 ng/m(3), respectively. The concentrations of Sigma(19) PAHs in warm seasons (spring and summer) were lower than those in cold seasons (autumn and winter). Annual fractions of low molecular weight (LMW)-PAHs (2-3 rings, 12.1%) and high molecular weight (HMVV)PAHs (4-7 rings, 87.9%) indicated a strong contribution of thermal processes. Significant correlations between Sigma(19) PAHs and TSP (p < 0.01) at all the sampling sites were observed, implying that increased TSP levels were responsible for elevated levels of PAHs. There were strong seasonal variations in the profiles of PAHs, and they were clearly reflected in the results of the principal component analysis. Diagnostic ratios and backward air trajectories suggested seasonal variations in the contribution of local emissions and long-range transport. The diagnostic ratios suggested that mixed sources were dominant in cold seasons, while coal/biomass burning and non-traffic sources were prevailing in warm seasons. BeP/BaP ratios indicated that local emissions were major sources compared with long-range transport except for summer. Backward air trajectories in winter suggested the influence of long-range transport, but local emissions were more important in this study area.

AB The chemical and physical properties of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) may be influenced by the aqueous environment within which SOA-forming reactions occur. Bulk-phase reactions between glyoxal and ammonium sulfate produce light-absorbing compounds such as imidazole-2-carboxaldehyde (IC) and biimidazole (BI) and model aerosol-phase chemistry. The effect of solvent composition on IC and BI production kinetics were examined for solutions containing a series of short-chain alcohols (methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, 2-butanol, tert-butanol, and 3-methyl-2-butanol), as functions of the species and concentration added. The addition of an alcohol likely altered the solvent by inducing the formation of micro-heterogeneities of hydrated alcohol molecules. An increased alcohol concentration in solution resulted in a general increase in the production of IC and BI, with ethanol and the secondary alcohols causing the largest changes. The rate constants for IC and BI production in solutions that do not contain alcohol are found to be (4.03 +/- 2.02) x 10(-6) s(-1) and (3.48 +/- 1.75) x 10(-6) s(-1), respectively. In solutions that do contain an alcohol, rate constant values range from 3.23 x 10(-6) s(-1) to 6.61 x 10(-6) s(-1) for IC and 0.985 x 10(-6) s(-1) to 6.87 x 10(-6) s(-1) for BI, depending on the alcohol and the concentration. While these prevailing trends of more alcohol in solution leading to amplified production of imidazoles were observed for all seven alcohols, the diversity of responses implies the mode of action depends strongly on the species of alcohol added. Properties that describe a solution in bulk, such as dielectric constant, are not found to be reliable predictors of subsequent system behavior. Solvent composition influences SOA chemistry, and interactions between relevant functional groups within solution drive this influence, which suggests the importance of understanding individual relationships between aerosol-phase chemicals and SOA properties and production.

AB This study investigates air pollutant concentrations across the international airshed spanning Detroit, Michigan, USA and Windsor, Ontario, Canada. The Geospatial Determinants of Health Outcomes Consortium (GeoDHOC) measured air quality concurrently in Detroit and Windsor using consistent sampling methods and locations during separate, two-week periods in September 2008 and May/June 2009. This paper presents 2009 results and compares them to previously reported 2008 campaign results to assess spatial and temporal variability. A high-density array of 100 passive and 50 active samplers was used to measure nitrogen dioxide (NO2), 26 volatile organic compounds (VOCs), 23 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and three size fractions of particulate matter (PM) in both campaigns. Geospatial and non-spatial tools were used to investigate changes in concentration distributions and site classification into low/medium/high tertiles between the campaigns. During the two-week 2009 campaign, general pollution patterns remained consistent with those observed during 2008. Higher concentrations in Detroit, strong correlations amongst the BTEX group, and consistency of sites falling into the low and high tertiles were observed. Similar spatial patterns for NO2, VOCs, BTEX, and PAHs were also found during both campaigns. Conversely, PM1.2.5 and PM2.5.10 distributions showed greater variability, as did toluene/benzene ratios. Observed differences are attributable to changes in point source emissions associated with changes in localized activities, possibly related to decreased economic and industrial activity in response to the downturn that began in late 2008. Repeated sampling at multiple locations is important to determine spatial and temporal variability in absolute concentrations. However, if the definition of relatively high and low concentrations regions within a well-established urban area is adequate to estimate future air pollutant exposures, a single multi-location campaign may suffice.

AB Studies including multiple isotope systems in aerosols promises unparalleled insights into sources and pathways of metals in the atmosphere. However, such studies remain rare because of the challenges associated with small sample sizes and low analyte masses of the target elements. Here, we present the first study combining accurate and precise determination of Pb, Cu and Zn isotopic ratios in aerosols and anthropogenic materials collected in Sao Paulo, Brazil. We use a sequential ion chromatography procedure with two different resins for the separation and purification of the analytes. Multi collector mass spectrometry is used for the accurate and precise determination of the isotope ratios. Long term analytical reproducibilities are +/- 0.035 for Pb-206/Pb-204, +/- 0.13% for delta(65) Cu-NIST and +/- 0.1 parts per thousand for delta Zn-66(JMC)( +/- 2 sigma). Accuracy is assessed using certified reference materials (CRM NIST 2783 aerossol, BRP-1 and others). We analyzed 57 source samples (road dust, tires, cement, road tunnel aerosol) and 113 aerosol samples collected between 2013 and 2015. The results for Sao Paulo are critically compared with previously published data from studies conducted in Sao Paulo, London and Barcelona. The key findings are: 1. The isotope signatures for Zn in tires (delta Zn-6(6)JMC = 0.16 +/- 0.14, 2 sigma, n = 9) and road dust (delta Zn-66(JMC) = 0.17 +/- 0.19, 2 sigma, n = 13) are similar in Sao Paulo and London suggesting that this isotope system can be used as element specific tracers for non-exhaust traffic. 2. (206)pb/(207)pb vs delta Zn-66(JMC) and delta Zn-66(JMC) vs delta(65) Cu-NIST multi-isotopic diagrams successfully separate wear off from cars including tires and brakes, car exhaust, industrial emissions and cement sources and improves the discrimination of air pollutant sources. 3. The source identification based on isotope ratios agrees source apportionment based on emissions inventory from these cities. 4. We present Pb, Cu and Zn isotopic data for the first time for the CRM NIST 2783 and BRP-1. These new data will enable future intercalibration and quality controls in other laboratories. Our study confirms that stable isotope ratio analysis have a great potential for element specific source characterization (e.g., separating non combustion traffic sources from combustion sources) for Cu, Zn and Pb.

AB Air pollution is a major environmental health problem around the world. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between exposure to air pollution with mortality and hospitalizations by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis.
   Several databases were searched for studies exploring the relationship between air pollution and the all-cause, cardiovascular and respiratory mortality, as well as hospitalizations. The risk of bias assessed by the Office of Health Assessment and Translation (OHAT) Method for each study included. Random-effects model was applied to estimate the relative risks of all-cause mortality and mortality/hospitalization due to cardiovascular and respiratory diseases.
   We found a 0.6% (95% CI 0.5%-0.7%) increase in all-cause, 0.5% (95% CI 0.4%-0.6%) increase in cardiovascular, and 0.8% (95% CI 0.6%-0.9%) increase in respiratory mortality per 10 mu g/m(3) increase of pooled all air pollutants. Moreover, we observed a 0.7% (95% CI 0.6%-0.9%) increase in hospitalization due to cardiovascular and respiratory diseases per 10 mu g/m(3) increase of pooled air pollutants. The highest all-cause mortality was associated with exposure to particulates with aerodynamic diameters less than 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) (681 deaths or 1.5%, 95% CI 1.3%-1.7%), followed by PM10 (253 deaths or 0.7%, 95% CI 0.6%-0.8%).
   The current study illustrated that all investigated air pollutants were associated with elevated mortality and hospitalization, but the effects of PM2.5 and PM10 were stronger. Thus, authorities need to pay more attention to establishing the new regulations to apply control measures.

AB Uncertainty was evaluated in four chemical mechanisms pertaining to O-3 concentrations predicted over Japan by the Community Multiscale Air Quality Model (CMAQ) to investigate factors contributing to model over-estimation of O-3 concentration. The model setting and meteorological and emissions input data were obtained from a Japanese model inter-comparison project, Japan's Study for Reference Air Quality Modeling (J-STREAM). The compared gas-phase chemical mechanisms included the Carbon Bond Mechanism (CB05TUCL), Regional Atmospheric Chemical Mechanism (RACM2), and two mechanisms developed by the State Air Pollution Research Center (SAPRC), namely SAPRCO7TC and SAPRC99. The O-3 concentrations produced by CB05TUCL were low compared to those from SAPRCO7TC. The RACM2 concentrations were similar to those from SAPRCO7TC over inland Japan and lower over the sea. The concentrations from SAPRC99 were higher than those from SAPRCO7TC in urban areas and lower in other areas. At most of the monitoring sites in Japan, the modeled O-3 concentrations were higher than those from observations. Module overestimation can be ranked in the order of SAPRC99 > SAPRCO7TC > RACM2 > CB05TUCL for urban sites and SAPRCO7TC > SAPRC99 > RACM2 > CB05TUCL for rural sites. The concentration differences between the chemical mechanisms were within 10 ppb, whereas those between the observed and simulated O-3 concentrations reached 40 ppb. Differences in O-3 concentrations between the chemical mechanisms accounted for only a part of the model overestimation, while the rest remained unexplained. To investigate factors influencing the differences in O-3 concentration between the chemical mechanisms, domain- and 10-vertical-layer-average hourly integrated process rates (IPRs) and integrated reaction rates (IRRs) were calculated using process analysis in CMAQ. The O-3 chemical IPRs from SAPRCO7TC were higher than those from CB05TUCL and RACM2. The SAPRC99 IPRs were higher than those from SAPRCO7TC in urban areas and lower in other areas. The IRR differences in the chemical mechanisms showed that IRRs for the O-3 and NO reactions were responsible for the differences in the O-3 chemical IPR. The coefficients of determination between the O-3 chemical process IPR and IRR differences in the chemical mechanisms were highest for the HO2-NO reaction in CB05TUCL and SAPRC99 and the RO2 -NO reaction in RACM2. Differences in reaction rate constants and lumped volatile organic compounds may have caused some of the differences in O-3 production between the chemical mechanisms.

AB Concern about the health impact of exposure to ultrafine particles has prompted a large number of research studies in the last twenty years. Attention focussed on conventional sources of pollution: vehicle emissions, generation of heat and power, as these are likely to be the most relevant sources of emission to which the general public are exposed. As a result, emissions from road vehicles are well characterised and regulated within Europe. In contrast, until relatively recently, little research into ultrafine particles had been specifically targeted at measurement of direct emissions from aircraft or their potential impact on the communities around airports. As a result, there are a number of gaps in our understanding of these emissions, behaviour in the atmosphere and the potential impact. Aircraft engines, especially the jet turbines used in commercial airliners, are known to emit large quantities of ultrafine particles under a wide range of operating modes, yet detailed information about the physical and chemical properties of these particles is poorly documented. This review aims to outline the background for the development of research studies, summarise the research and assessment of aircraft ultrafine particle emissions, and explore possible areas for future research in this area.

AB Citizen science data from the Safecast project were shown to provide a reliable estimation of the spatial distribution of concentrations of elevated radiation levels around Fukushima when compared to government data. A comparison is presented between the HYSPLIT Lagrangian atmospheric transport and dispersion (T&D) model and a reflected Gaussian model to both government and Safecast contributed measurements. The advantage of contributed data with respect to the government data is that they are collected over a long period of time and have a larger spatial coverage.
   First, the Safecast contributed measurements are compared to aerial surveys completed by the Department of Energy (DOE) and the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA). Then the HYSPLIT T&D model is run to simulate the nuclear release using high resolution terrain and meteorological data. A Gaussian dispersion model is also run for comparison using meteorological data observed at the time of the accident. The results of both models and observed data are decay corrected to December 2016 in order to use a larger quantity of contributed measurements in the comparison.
   The comparison of areas of elevated radiation shows that the citizen science observations align with the prediction of models representing dynamic behavior of radionuclides dispersed in the environment. This paper shows that citizen science data can be used to validate and potentially better calibrate atmospheric T&D models.

AB Surrogate surfaces are used to measure atmospheric dry deposition of contaminants and are sometimes designed intentionally with simple geometry to estimate the lower limit of the flux to any surface. However, most surrogate surfaces have a small collection area: long periods of dry weather may be needed to obtain sufficient deposited contaminants to be detected and quantified, and such exposure periods may not be common in wet climates. In this study, two relatively large surrogate surfaces-disks with surface areas > 1 m(2)-were designed to measure dry deposition of F-, Cl-, SO4-2, and NO3- in Syracuse, NY. Results indicate that good reproducibility is possible for measurements with exposure periods of 2-6 days. The ranges of dry deposition velocities for each species are as follows: F- (0.6-2.5 cm/s), Cl- (1.9-9.2 cm/s), SO42- (0.11-1.8 cm/s), and NO3- (0.1-1.1 cm/s). Fluxes were also measured to four separate sections of the disk; results suggest that deposition varies somewhat across the disk in a way that is consistent with boundary layer thickness predicted by Computational Fluid Dynamics modeling.

AB In a series of 10-day campaigns in Ontario and Quebec, Canada, between 2005 and 2007, ozonesondes were launched twice daily in conjunction with continuous high-resolution wind-profiling radar measurements. Windprofilers can measure rapid changes in the height of the tropopause, and in some cases follow stratospheric intrusions. Observed stratospheric intrusions were studied with the aid of a Lagrangian particle dispersion model and the Canadian operational weather forecast system. Definite stratosphere-troposphere transport (STT) events occurred approximately every 2-3 days during the spring and summer campaigns, whereas during autumn and winter, the frequency was reduced to every 4-5 days. Although most events reached the lower troposphere, only three events appear to have significantly contributed to ozone amounts in the surface boundary layer. Detailed calculations find that STT, while highly variable, is responsible for an average, over the seven campaigns, of 3.1% of boundary layer ozone (1.2 ppb), but 13% (5.4 ppb) in the lower troposphere and 34% (22 ppb) in the middle and upper troposphere, where these layers are defined as 0-1 km, 1-3 km, and 3-S km respectively. Estimates based on counting laminae in ozonesonde profiles, with judicious choices of ozone and relative humidity thresholds, compare moderately well, on average, with these values. The lamina detection algorithm is then applied to a large dataset from four summer ozonesonde campaigns at 18 North American sites between 2006 and 2011. The results show some site-to-site and year-to-year variability, but stratospheric ozone contributions average 4.6% (boundary layer), 15% (lower troposphere) and 26% (middle/upper troposphere). Calculations were also performed based on the TOST global 3D trajectory-mapped ozone data product. Maps of STT in the same three layers of the troposphere suggest that the STT ozone flux is greater over the North American continent than Europe, and much greater in winter and spring than in summer or fall. When averaged over all seasons, magnitudes over North America show similar ratios between levels to the previous calculations, but are overall 3-4 times smaller. This may be because of limitations (trajectory length and vertical resolution) to the current TOST-based calculation.

AB The extinction coefficient of aerosol will directly affect the atmospheric visibility, which is influenced by many factors such as aerosol of particle number concentration distribution, chemical composition, relative humidity (RH) and so on. During the period between 25 August and 05 September 2017, the physical and chemical characteristics of aerosol were measured to explore the effect of those factors on the extinction coefficient in Beijing during four environmental conditions (heavy pollution (HP); light pollution (LP); clean (CL); and rainy (RA)). After the new particle formation events during CL2, the ratio of particle number concentrations in the Accumulation mode (Acc) and Aitken mode (Ait) gradually grew from 0.2 (CL2) to 0.7 (LP1), 0.9 (HP) and 0.8 (LP2). The contributions of particle number concentrations to the extinction coefficient were 0.1% (0.1%), 10.5% (1.4%) and 89.4% (98.5%) in the Nucleation mode (Nuc), Ait and Acc, respectively, during CL1 (HP), which revealed that particles with an extinction function were mainly in Acc, especially during polluted days (PDs). The mass percentage of secondary inorganic aerosol (nitrate, sulfate and ammonium) with a greater hydrophilic characteristic was just 12.8% during clean days (CDs), while this rapidly increased to 56.5% during PDs, which was the main reason for the increase in the extinction coefficient. The sensitivity test of the extinction coefficient calculated using different refractive indices indicated that using the refractive index of the average value of a long observation would cause an underestimation of the extinction coefficient. The hygroscopic factors of the aerosol scattering coefficient (f(RH)) were 1.13, 1.59, 1.49 and 1.62 during CL2, LPL HP and LP2, when RH = 80.0%, respectively. The extinction coefficients calculated by the kappa-AMS-BC-Mie model and measured by the sum of the scattering and absorption coefficients were 675.7 and 521.2 Mm(-1) under dry conditions during HP, while those values were 855.7 and 661.7 Mm(-1) after correcting for RH. When the hygroscopic growth factor (GF) reached 1.1, the range of f(RH) was approximately 1.30-1.38 during all campaigns. Therefore, on PDs with high RH, aerosol with a greater number of hygroscopic components, which are mainly distributed in Acc, will produce a much larger extinction coefficient.

AB Sulfur trioxide (SO3) pollution is becoming another severe problem in coal-fired power plants after SO2, NOx, and PM, however, the characteristics of SO3 emission in China remains unclear. In this paper, we established a refined activity data, and summarized the removal efficiency of different control technologies according to the literature review and field test results. An emission inventory of SO3 from coal-fired power plants in China between 2009 and 2014 was developed, which indicated the SO3 emission increased from 199.7 kilotons (kt) to 314.6 kt at an average annual growth rate of 9.7%. The results show that Neimenggu, Shanxi, Jiangsu, Shandong, Guangdong and Guizhou were the largest emitters, accounting for 49.7% of the total SO3 emissions in 2014. We analyzed the historical data with ArcGIS system, which allocates the emission into 36 km x 36 km grid cells. In addition, the result shows the unevenly spatial distribution. Combined with future economic development as well as implementation of policy, three different scenarios were set to project SO3 emission in coal-fired power plants in 2020, which represented the potential of SO3 emission reduction. Compared with scenario A, SO3 emission can be reduced to 83.9 kt in scenario B, and in scenarios C, SO3 emission can be reduced to 38.4 kt. Coal-fired power plants should adopt different technology routes to meet the ultra-low emission requirement and reduce the SO3 emission according to the boiler type, sulfur content, and the emission standard.

AB An online coupled regional chemistry-aerosol-climate model was developed and applied to explore the distribution, evolution and indirect effects of marine primary organic aerosols (MPOA) over East Asia during the period from 12 March to 22 April 2014. Model results were compared with a variety of observations from ground measurement, cruise experiment and satellite retrievals, which demonstrated the model was capable of reproducing reasonably well the major features in meteorological variables, gas species, aerosol components and cloud properties in the western Pacific Ocean in springtime. Active bloom events were observed in the western Pacific Ocean during the study period, with mean surface seawater Chlorophyll a (Chl-a) concentrations up to 10 mg (-3) in the Yellow Sea, East China Sea, Sea of Japan, as well as the ocean northeast of Japan. The mean surface MPOA concentration was simulated to be up to 2.5 mu g m(-3) in the East China Sea, followed by that in the ocean northeast of Japan, and about 0.5 mu g m(-3) in the coastal areas of east China. MPOA generally caused increases in the cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC), cloud optical depth (COD) and cloud liquid water path (CLWP), but decrease in the cloud droplet effective radius (CDER). The above changes in cloud properties induced a negative indirect radiative effect (IRE), with the mean values being -5.3 Wm(-2), -8.2 Wm(-2) and -12.2 Wm(-2) over the ocean, East China Sea and the north western Pacific Ocean, which accounted for about 40%, 35% and 51% of the IRE due to all aerosols in these regions, respectively. It was noteworthy that the MPOA induced IRE was -3.6 Wm(-2) in east China, accounting for 20% of the IRE by all aerosols and the percentage contribution was about 32% for the whole domain, suggesting its important influence on cloud and radiation during the study period. The sensitivity of MPOA activation to the factors affecting hygroscopicity and surface tension was examined by sensitivity simulations. The indirect effects of MPOA tended to suppress precipitation in most of the domain, with the maximum decrease in the accumulated precipitation up to 50 mm in parts of south China and the East China Sea. In terms of domain average, MPOA accounted for 16%, 22%, 18% of the precipitation reduction due to all aerosols over the land, ocean and the whole domain, respectively, indicating its nonnegligible influence on precipitation over East Asia in springtime 2014.

AB Continuous detection of dispersion and residence of volcanic plumes in troposphere and lower stratosphere is vitally important for improving the understanding on the role of volcano eruptions in climate change. We report a 3-month continuous detection of dispersion and residence of volcanic plumes in the troposphere and stratosphere generated from the volcanic SO2 erupted by Nabro in Eritrea on June 12th, 2011 observed by the OMI sensor. The background SO2 concentration of 3 different height layers in troposphere and lower stratosphere were estimated by the 3-year-average daily concentration of monthly SO2 in 2005, 2007 and 2013, when there were no large explosive volcanic eruptions occurring. We also traced the diffusion path and the concentration of volcanic SO2 for the first 3 months after Nabro's eruption, and detected the appearance and dissipation of sulfate aerosols, which is a product converted from volcanic SO2. The results show that after Nabro erupted on June 12th, the volcanic plumes spread to middle latitudes (30 degrees N -60 degrees N) of Northern Hemisphere and loading by westerly jet. The volcanic SO2 in middle troposphere layer (TRM) and lower troposphere layer (TRL) stopped eastward spreading, and dissipated over the western Pacific Ocean on June 23rd. On June 26th, the volcanic SO2 in upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (STL) reached Mexico in Central America, and almost encircled the low latitudes and parts of middle latitudes. On June 28th, the volcanic SO2 plume showed an even distribution in STL. 37 days after the eruption, the volcanic SO2 in STL encircled the Northern Hemisphere evenly, sulfate aerosols in STL largely covered the low and middle latitudes and the daily concentration of SO2 was still higher than the background value. One month after the eruption, the global mean daily concentration of SO2 dropped to the normal value, but the daily concentration of SO2 and sulfate aerosols in low latitudes remained high, and dissipated not earlier than 3 months after the eruption of Nabro.

AB The size distribution of a particle population has proven to be of great value in source apportionment studies. Previous studies have reported that particle size distributions in ambient urban air vary with location and time, indicating that the ambient particles are affected by known sources. However, the size distributions of individual chemical species emitted from primary sources have received relatively little attention. This study presents a preliminary real-world investigation of the size distributions of particles emissions from coal-fired power plants, residential coal combustion, biomass burning, vehicles, soil dust and steelworks based on a high size-resolution measurement using an Electrical Low Pressure Impactor. The size profiles of individual chemical elements are found to have a high degree of source specificity, which assists source classification. We subsequently employed a chemical mass balance approach termed size-resolved CMB (SR-CMB), which is based on the use of both physical and chemical information on the high size-resolution measurements of particulate matter. By applying SR-CMB on the measured ambient data, source contributions to ambient particles were successfully obtained when copper (Cu) was chosen as the fitting species. The approach described in this paper enhances the capability of the CMB model and provides a useful tool to validate results of traditional receptor models when a high size resolution measurement is available. This effort also highlights that the size profiles of sources is of potential concern in the situations when the chemically collinear sources exist.

AB Aerosol and cloud condensate nuclei (CCN) measurements in the area of Athens during HyGRA-CD campaign (May June 2014) identified a significant diversity in particle properties. In this study we select two distinct cases in terms of meteorology and air mass origin in order to analyze the transport mechanisms inside the Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL) and in the free troposphere and discuss the possible contribution of aerosol in cloud formation. The detection of aerosol layers was based on the lidar technique using multi-wavelength detection schemes. The first case is characterized by a double dust layer arriving over Athens with a shallow and younger plume centered at about 1.8 km and a deeper and more aged plume centered at 3.4 km. These layers originate from different sources and follow different transport paths in the atmosphere which explains also their different optical/geometrical properties. The second case is typical of frontal activity and low cloud formation during daytime. Low level convergence of maritime and continental air masses enhances the updraft velocities inside Athens basin and results in CCN activation and cloud formation along the frontal line.

AB Previous studies of glaciochemical records retrieved from the southern and northern sectors of the Tibetan Plateau (TP) have revealed that there are diverse patterns of climate change within this region. However, uncertainty remains regarding changes in the atmospheric environment over the central TP where the Indian monsoonal circulation and westerly winds meet. This study presents a glaciochemical record of the past 112 years from the upper part of the ice core drilled into the Qiangtang Glacier No.1 (QT-1) located in the central TP. The purpose of this study is to understand the glaciochemical controls, if any, and how these controls have been affected by both local climate parameters and atmospheric circulation patterns. An empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis was performed to determine the significance of any chemical components. The results show that the major soluble ions (Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Cl-, NO3-, NH4+ and SO42-) are predominantly controlled by crustal aerosols and have high loadings on EOF1. Correlation analysis between EOF1 and the annual dust-event frequency recorded by local/regional meteorological stations suggests that the ice core chemical record provides a reasonable proxy for local/regional atmospheric dust loading. Analysis of EOF1 also demonstrates changes that are consistent with regional meteorological parameters and large-scale circulations, revealing a strong link with the glaciochemical record. The windy, cold-dry climate and/or enhanced northwesterly/westerly winds appear to be responsible for the higher atmospheric dust aerosols, leading to higher concentrations of ions. Our analysis also isolated a significant positive correlation between EOF1 and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) index, suggesting that, as an underlying mechanism, the PDO likely influences the regional climate conditions and atmospheric circulation patterns and thereby the QT-1 ion records. Our findings may, therefore, enhance the understanding of the relationship between chemical records and climatological variations that are preserved in ice cores, improve our knowledge of changes in the composition of the atmosphere and atmospheric circulation over the central TP, and potentially facilitate reconstruction of the paleo-PDO.

AB New four-dimensional aerosol climatology for global weather forecasting model is developed to take aerosol direct effect into account and its impacts on numerical weather prediction are investigated. The proposed aerosol climatology provides the global distribution of monthly-varying species-wise aerosol optical depths with more realistic aerosol vertical profiles. Including aerosol climatology enhances vertical stratification by surface cooling and atmospheric heating through the lower atmosphere by affecting radiation budget. Weakened vertical mixing and reduced surface fluxes related to aerosol loading result in decreased cloud fraction, particularly in the lower atmosphere. Evaluation of medium-range forecasts using the proposed aerosol climatology shows the overall improvement statistically for large-scale variable with reducing their biases, and the alleviation of systematic biases of overestimated light precipitation over the northern hemisphere.

AB Vertical profiles of ozone (O-3), aerosols, and winds in Paris, France have been measured via remote sensing (Lidar) during a 36 h intensive observation period (IOP) on 9-10 September 2014. The measurements show an ozone poor layer (ozone concentrations as low as 40 mu g.m(-3)) is present above the nocturnal boundary layer (NBL) during the IOP (similar to 400 m AGL, 10 Sept. 2014 06:00 LT). This ozone poor layer is reincorporated in the morning into the developing daytime boundary layer, resulting in lower measured surface ozone concentrations in Paris. Specifically, the surface ozone concentration at 12:30 LT is 33 mu g.m(-3) smaller on 10 Sept. 2014 than on 9 Sept. 2014 in Paris. This ozone poor layer is also co-located with a nocturnal low-level jet (NLLJ), which transports air away from the Paris region, resulting in lower ozone concentrations downwind of Paris the following day. We track transport and dispersion of this airmass using the regional Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model combined with the FLEXible PARTicle dispersion model (FLEXPART-WRF). This dataset demonstrates that clean air masses above the NBL have the ability to impact "next-day" ozone concentrations in cities and the surrounding areas. Our analysis shows that vertical mixing and incorporation of ozone located above the boundary layer in the morning is a significant factor that can control daytime surface ozone concentrations in Paris and the surrounding area.

AB To understand the impact of pollution control measures on the ambient fine particle (PM2.5) in Nanjing, two sampling campaigns before and after the release of pollution control measures (BPCM: Jan.-Nov. 2014 and APCM: Nov. 2015-Jul. 2016) were conducted. Chemical compositions, sources, regional transport, and potential health risks of PM2.5 for the two distinguishable periods were compared. Results showed that the annual averaged PM2.5 concentrations in Nanjing decreased by 12.4% from BPCM (100 +/- 54.3 mu g m(-3)) to APCM (87.6 +/- 56.4 mu g(-3)). Chemical mass closure showed that secondary inorganic aerosols (SIA) contributed most to the PM2.5 mass (50.7% and 47.1% for BPCM and APCM), followed by carbonaceous components (30.8% and 33.8%) for both the two periods. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) modeling showed that the annual average mass contributions of biomass burning (BB), industrial process (IP), vehicle emission (VE), and secondary inorganic aerosol (SIA) decreased by 5.60%, 60.9%, 22.0% and 35.8%, respectively, from BPCM to APCM, whereas the contribution of coal combustion (CC) increased by 94.1% due to the significant increase in winter. Combined with the PMF, Hybrid Single Particle Lagrange Trajectory (HYSPLIT), potential source contribution function (PSCF), concentration-weighted trajectory (CWT), and cluster analysis results, the regional transport of the five identified sources in different periods were obtained. The regional transport of BB, IP, VE and SIA decreased by 50.9%, 82.9%, 10.5%, and 23.4%, respectively from BPCM to APCM, while the CC increased by 131% from BPCM to APCM. Health risk assessment showed that the non-carcinogenic risk and carcinogenic risk of PM2.5-bound heavy metals decreased by 50.0% and 58.3%, respectively. These results indicated that the PM2.5 pollution control measures were effective in Nanjing, for both reducing the mass concentrations and health risks of PM2.5. Further attention should be paid to the reduction of the secondary inorganic aerosols and industrial process, due to their high contribution to PM2.5 mass and health risks. This study also highlighted the impact of regional transport of coal combustion emission from north China on south cities, which should be controlled more strictly especially in winter of China.

AB Processes on both synoptic scale and mesoscale contribute to variations in the atmospheric water vapor isotopic signal in the lower troposphere. The drivers of the isotopic composition of water vapor at these temporal scales is a key topic of discussion. The aim of this paper is to decouple mesoscale from synoptic processes that affect the water vapor isotopic composition over a coastal lagoon and to quantify the vertical mixing and sea breeze contributions to the daily water vapor cycle. We monitored the water vapor isotopic composition at the beginning of the 2017 spring season for 21 days, at the inland boundary of the Venetian Lagoon (Italy) with a commercially available cavity ring-down spectroscopy analyzer. Mean atmospheric pressure fields and back trajectories are used to investigate the long-range transport of water vapor to the study area. Moisture source areas and d-excess correlation maps show that the control on the d-excess parameter is dominated by the mesoscale contribution. The daily cycle of water vapor is studied in detail, showing that the intrusion of air from the free atmosphere represents the main process that occurs in the morning. Under those circumstances, the morning variability of the water vapor isotopic composition can be used as a proxy for the Planetary Boundary Layer height. The study period was characterized by a constant development of the sea breeze circulation that conserved the marine signature of water vapor until the afternoon. However, the water vapor isotopic signal tends to stabilize when atmospheric conditions such as high relative humidity and a weak gradient in the atmospheric pressure field occur, leading to the establishment of an isotopic equilibrium between the atmospheric water vapor and surface waters.

AB During two growing seasons of a maritime pine stand, in 2014 and 2015, ozone (O-3) fluxes have been determined using the eddy covariance (EC) method and compared to the outputs of a big-leaf O-3 deposition model including stomatal, cuticular and soil pathways. The model developed in this study generally allowed to properly reproduce the measured ozone deposition. Ozone fluxes showed a strong reduction during two water stressed periods in September 2014 and July 2015. The model partly explain this fall due to the reduction of stomatal deposition. Despite this stomatal closure, measured O-3 fluxes presented systematically lower negative values than the model outputs, and sometimes even positive values around midday during periods marked by strong water stress. In other words, the difference between observed and modelled O-3 fluxes (hereinafter referred to as the residual O-3 flux) is systematically positive on daytime during these water-stressed periods.
   This positive residual flux traduced the existence of an O-3 source below the flux measurement level, responsible for positive fluxes that counterbalance deposition fluxes. We developed an O-3 production module based on a terpene emission algorithm and an OH concentration proxy, to try to explain the observed ozone production. As this parametrisation allowed us to reproduce well the daily and inter-daily dynamics of the residual O-3 flux, it confirms that the latter actually resulted from O-3 production processes. This ozone production is here highlighted for the first time using O-3 fluxes measurements by the EC method. The chemical reactions possibly involved in O-3 production processes in this maritime pine forest have been discussed and different mechanisms are proposed, based on peroxy radicals chemistry or stress-induced BVOCs.

AB Formation of haze is a phenomenon dependent on the relative atmospheric humidity and concentration of aerosol particles. The physical and chemical reactions on particle surfaces would lead to variations in particle sizes. This paper focuses on the physical behaviour of aerosol particles under the influence of atmospheric humidity, which produces liquid bridging forces and electrostatic interactions among particles. By water absorption experiment, a correlation between relative humidity (RH) and water content on particles was obtained. Through theoretical derivation, a relationship between the relative humidity and humidity ratio was established for calculating liquid bridging forces. The findings from experiments on atmospheric particles charging, showed most aerosols were negatively or positively charged and the average charges on these particles was more than one. An extended soft-sphere discrete element method (DEM) was used to simulate the evolution of aerosol particles, encapsulated in water vapour by considering liquid bridging forces, electrostatic interactions and Brownian forces. Results suggest that the agglomeration rate of particles would increase with a rise in the atmospheric humidity due to the increased liquid bridging forces that enhance the agglomeration velocity. The higher humidity would enhance the ionization on particle surfaces, which could affect electrostatic interactions. This paper provides an insight of a mechanism for formation of haze in atmosphere.

AB Air pollution events at urban locations are driven by both emissions and atmospheric dispersion conditions. Atmospheric dispersion is not routinely assessed at monitoring networks thus preventing the possibility of understanding if high pollution events are due to increasing emissions or to the occurrence of atmospheric stability conditions. In principle, this piece of information would be very useful to implement effective strategies for pollution abatement. In this work, an 18-year long dataset of radon (Rn-222) progeny measurements was used to estimate equivalent mixing layer heights (hereafter referred to as MH) with hourly resolution by means of a box model. Mean MH obtained by more conventional modelling approaches based on turbulence variables on a 5 year long dataset agreed very well with results obtained by the box model. It is noteworthy that in the literature there are scarce MH data for such long periods and comparisons between estimates by radioactive tracers and other approaches are often limited to a few days/weeks. Results suggested that relatively simple methods like the one here proposed could be implemented at pollution monitoring stations in order to improve available information and better understand the evolution of pollution events on 1-h timescale. In addition, the long-term assessment here presented provides useful data to pursue MH climatological studies.

AB This study developed a receptor model, comprising four non-negative matrix factorization algorithms: the multiplicative update method; the optimal gradient method; the highly efficient, monotonic, fixed-point method; and the conjugate gradient method. The feasibility and performance of the developed model for emission source apportionment were assessed, using both a synthetic dataset, and an ambient PM2.5 dataset. The results from the US EPA's positive matrix factorization (PMF) 5.0 model were used for the assessment. Modeled results for the synthetic data showed that the range of factor contributions to most matrix elements solved by the four algorithms covered actual values. Modeled results, using the ambient dataset as the input, showed that the four algorithms in the developed model, and the PMF model, identified the same eight emission sources, and apportioned similar source contributions to PM2.5. Comparisons between the modeled organic carbon, and the elemental carbon source apportionments and radiocarbon measurements, suggested that combined application of multiple algorithms could satisfactorily apportion emission source contributions for one, or a few, specified samples among a receptor dataset, thus confirming the excellent source apportionment ability of the proposed model.

AB Land use regression (LUR) has been used to predict NO2 and NO distribution. However, previous studies overlooked the possibility that the effect of land-use configuration on NO2 and NO may not always be constant across the study domain. The objective of this study was to depict the spatially varying effect so as to better predict NO2 and NO. First, a LUR model was adopted to screen the land-use factors for NO2 and NO predictions. Then, a geographically weighted regression (GWR) model was developed to delineate the spatial non-stationarity in the relationship. The results show that the GWR model improved NO2 and NO prediction accuracy, with increases of 29.3% and 6.9%, respectively. The road ERSD (i.e., shortest distance to express road) factor had a negative effect on NO2. The impervious AWMSI (i.e., area-weighted mean shape index) factor had a larger effect on NO in the northwest of Foshan, due to more uneven and dense distribution of impervious patches. NO had a steeper distribution gradient than NO2, which implies that NO is more localized. The relationships between land use configuration, NO2 and NO concentrations are not constant in space. This means that the predictive abilities of land-use factors for NO2 and NO are different across Foshan. Overall, our approach can obtain a higher estimation accuracy than the LUR at city scale. It could also be applied easily for other air pollutants and in cities worldwide.

AB The most polluted urban agglomeration including 13 cities in Central-East China (112-122 degrees E, 34-42 degrees N) were selected to study the impacts of meteorology features on PM2.5 levels during the severe haze episode by using observational PM2.5 concentration, surface and balloon sounding meteorology data. The study results showed that the temporal changing of PM2.5 in the 13 cities showed well correlation at the haze beginning, maintenance, and ending period due to the similar 500 hPa circulation and surface sea level pressure pattern. The increasing of surface relative humidity (RH) and temperature preceded PM2.5 accumulation when haze began. RH usually reached up to 90-95% during the period of PM2.5 peak, suggesting the possible contribution of high humidity to extreme PM2.5 values. In contrast to the similar circulation of upper air and surface pressure pattern, the divergences of local PBL meteorology, especially their vertical structure, were very obvious, which was the major meteorology cause for the different PM2.5 levels in these cities. The temperature rise at 850 hPa layer was higher than that at 925 hPa, which was higher than that at 1000 hPa, leading to the formation of temperature inversion. This was the most important trigger factor for haze. PM2.5 maximum generally occurred within 12 h after the formation of the strongest inversion in each city. PM2.5 levels in the 13 cities strongly depend on their reverse intensity: for the cities where the inversion was strong and long lasting, its PM2.5 was often the highest. Stable inversions are more likely to form in the transitional area from the northwestern mountains to the southeastern plains because of the mountain's blocking of cold air and the warming of boundary layer by sinking airflow from the mountaintop. This is the major meteorology cause for the frequent occurrence of the extreme PM2.5 levels in middle-south plain of Hebei province. This study reminds us that local boundary layer and inversion conditions, closely related with geographical location and local topography, contributes greatly to local PM2.5 levels and should be fully considered in the emission reduction and industrial layout policy by government.

TI Seasonal variations of nitrate dual isotopes in wet deposition in a

AB Monthly analytical results for more than two years long of delta N-15 and delta O-15 of nitrate in wet deposition are reported for a tropical city of Zhanjiang in the southernmost mainland China, in an effort to elucidate NOx sources and its oxidation pathways to nitrate. The results showed that monthly variations of delta O-18 NO3- responded well to changes in sunshine hours, with lower delta O-15-NO3- values corresponding to longer sunshine hours. This pattern suggests that NO oxidation via the OH radical was the predominant pathway, which, by estimate, accounted for 87% in winter and 94% in summer, for nitrate formation. Remarkably, we found that the delta O-18-NO3- here are prominently low relative to previous studies, likely due to that annual sunshine hours in this tropical city is relatively long. Moreover, available data of reported delta O-18-NO3- in wet deposition showed an increasing trend with latitude, reflecting a shift of the predominant NOx oxidation pathways from those via the OH radical in low latitudes to those via O-3 in high latitudes, corresponding to the decrease of sunshine hours. A temporarily co-variation of delta O-15-NO3- and delta O-18-NO3- was observed, exhibiting higher values in dry winter and lower values in wet summer, which was attributed to the washout effect on the dual isotopes. During wet seasons, complete nitrate washout suggests that delta N-15-NO3- in precipitation should be similar to the nitrate formed in the atmosphere, and thereby can be used for source apportionment. A Bayesian model showed that the source of atmospheric nitrate deposition is mainly natural (61%) in Zhanjiang, with less anthropogenic contribution.

AB A dual dynamic chamber system combined with incoherent broadband cavity enhanced absorption spectroscopy (IBBCEAS) was first developed to measure nitrous acid (HONO) emission fluxes from agricultural fields in the North China Plain. The concentrations of HONO were measured with two IBBCEAS instruments in the sample and blank chambers, respectively. To ensure the accuracy and reliability of flux measurement, before the dynamic chamber system was deployed in an agricultural field, the correlation and accuracy of the two IBBCEAS instruments were tested, and the mixing uniformity of the gas in the chamber was verified. Within a week after fertilization, the observed HONO flux exhibited a pronounced diurnal variation profile with a maximum of 20.25 ng m(-2) s(-1) at noontime and a minimum of -0.86 ng N m(-2) s(-1) in the early morning, one order of magnitude higher than the flux observed in previously reported literature from fields. During this period, the concentrations of HONO in both of the chambers was higher in the daytime than that nighttime, and the concentration of HONO in blank chamber reached the maximum of 18.88 ppbv at noon on the 5th day after fertilization. HONO and NO2 in the sample chambers showed opposite diurnal profiles. The field observation results suggested that the high HONO flux is mainly from the direct emission of soil rather than from the heterogeneous reaction of NO2. Agricultural fertilization will affect the balance of the HONO budget, and then affect the atmospheric oxidation in the North China Plain.

AB We performed continuous observations (2012-2015) of total peroxy nitrates (PNs) and total organic nitrates (ONs) at Suzu on the Noto peninsula, Japan. It was found that PNs and ONs showed similar seasonal variations with maximum concentrations in spring and minimum concentrations in summer. Concentrations of PNs and ONs were high for air masses originating from the Asian continent from winter to spring, whereas they were independent of air mass origin from spring to summer. In summer, PNs and ONs indicated similar diurnal variations with maximum concentrations during daytime and minimum concentrations during nighttime. Such diurnal variations of PNs and ONs were small in winter. Diurnal variations of PNs in spring were similar to those in summer, whereas such diurnal variations were not observed for ONs in spring. In the cold season, PNs and ONs have long atmospheric lifetimes and local photochemical production rates of PNs and ONs are slow, whereas the converse is true in the warm season. Therefore, concentration variations of PNs and ONs are governed primarily by long-range transport in the cold season and by local photochemical production in the warm season.

AB A three-dimensional chemical transport model, PMCAMx, was used to quantify the contribution of biomass burning organic aerosol (bbOA) to total organic aerosol (OA) concentrations in the continental U.S. Simulations were performed during three seasonally-representative months (April, July, and September 2008). Biomass burning is predicted to contribute 9% of the domain-averaged OA in April, 28% in July and 13% in September. Secondary OA from semivolatile and intermediate volatility organic compounds is the largest contributor to bbOA concentrations for all months simulated, followed by fresh primary OA. PMCAMx bbOA predictions using the Volatility Basis Set were compared to the results of CAMx version 6.10 that assumes that bbOA is nonvolatile and inert. PMCAMx predicts 66%, 113%, and 108% higher average concentration values of bbOA for April, July, and September, respectively. Predicted OA concentrations at biomass-impacted sites were compared to observed values from the STN and IMPROVE networks. The treatment of biomass burning emissions as semivolatile and reactive improved model performance during the spring and summer. During the fall both models overpredicted the OA levels, suggesting that the fire emissions may have been overestimated. In this case the additional SOA produced in PMCAMx resulted in worse performance.

AB Given its excellent cleaning ability, environment amity, low toxicity, etc., 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4-heptafluorocyclopentane (F7A) has been recommended as a new generation of cleaning agent with great application potential. In this paper, the atmospheric degradation of F7A initiated by reacting with OH radical is studied both in theory and experiment. The experimental rate constants of F7A with OH are tested to be 6.26 x 10(-13)exp (-954/T) within the temperature range of 303-310 K and the atmospheric lifetime of F7A at 272 K is extrapolated to be 1.69 years. These values show reasonable consistence with the theoretical ones. After that, two possible degradation pathways leading to three main products are given by Gaussian 09. Take the theoretical pathways and the subsequent products analysis into consideration, a model for F7A degradation in atmosphere is built. The short lifetime of F7A and its degradation products contribute F7A an environmentally friendly agent for practical applications.

AB Iron (Fe) is a limiting nutrient in the Southern Ocean (SO), and the input of atmospheric iron may fertilize the SO. Therefore, it is important to estimate the deposition and solubility of atmospheric iron in the Antarctica. For this purpose, we measured iron in a 3m snow pit from the Lambert Glacial Basin (LGB), covering the period 2012-2017. We estimated an average annual dissolved iron (DFe) flux of 1.29 x 10(-3) mg m(-2) a(-1) and an average total dissolvable iron (TDFe) flux of 0.14 mg m(-2) a(-1) for this site. The atmospheric fractional iron solubility (FFS) ranges from 0.01% to 21.47% (mean value 1.20%) and shows an inverse hyperbolic relationship with the TDFe concentration. This relationship suggests that atmospheric iron in the LGB comes from a mixture of mineral dust with low FFS and aerosol with high FFS (e.g. combustion aerosols and volcanic ash). Based on the mean value of the atmospheric iron deposit fluxes from both this and previous studies, we estimated that similar to 0.013 Gg of dissolved atmospheric iron could be deposited in the seasonal sea ice zone (SSIZ) every year, potentially supporting an annual algal production of similar to 2.52 x 10(12) g C in the Antarctic coastal water. This is less than 1% of the annual primary production in the SSIZ of the SO estimated from satellite data. The result shows that, compared with other sources of iron such as iceberg and glacier meltwater, the dissolved atmospheric iron has very small effect on the annual primary production in the SSIZ.

AB Light rail transit (LRT) has a reputation for being cleaner and healthier than automobiles. However, few studies have examined the effects of mode shift from automobile to LRT. This paper investigates to what extent mode shift from car to LRT can reduce personal exposure to PM2.5, BC, and UFP. Simultaneous measurements on LRT and automobile were conducted under four plausible commuting scenarios in Los Angeles, California from October to November in 2014. As a robustness check, Monte Carlo simulations were performed to test the effects of confounding factors. Under the closed ventilation and low traffic condition, personal exposure measurements inside LRT were significantly higher than in automobile for BC (+ 40%, p < 0.01) and UFP (+ 27%, p < 0.01). However, under the open ventilation and high traffic condition, personal exposure was significantly lower in LRT than in automobile for PM2.5 (-38%, p < 0.01); BC (-68%, p < 0.01); and UFP (-141%, p < 0.01). Results of the Monte Carlo simulations suggest that other factors, such as vehicle fan strength, vehicle speed, and vehicle age, appear to have marginal effects on personal exposure. These results demonstrate that the effect of mode shift from car to LRT can be significantly altered by ventilation settings and travel route choices. Results inform future research and policy about the importance of incorporating ventilation and traffic microenvironments for assessing the health effects of a mode switch from car to LRT.

AB Sulfate is a major component of atmospheric fine particulate matter in the troposphere. Globally, observed sulfate concentrations are generally high in summer and low in winter. Current air quality models fail to reproduce high winter sulfate concentrations observed during substantial pollution episodes in northern China. From ambient measurement data, it was reported that contrary to current belief, sulfate, that is normally considered as a secondary species, was actually largely primary. The present study presents direct evidence of primary sulfate emissions from residential coal combustion (RCC) by testing particulate matter (PM) emissions from briquettes and chunk coal burned in a household stove. Sulfate accounted for 16.6 +/- 7.7% and 29.2 +/- 8.7% of PM2.5 mass emissions from this stove burning coal briquettes and chunk coal, respectively. Using the 2014 emissions inventory, 1215 tons of PM10 sulfate were estimated to have been emitted from RCC in Xi'an, a megacity that continually experiences severe PM pollution in northern China. The RCC contribution was also estimated using a constrained positive matrix factorization in which RCC accounted for averages of 26% and 32% of ambient PM2.5 mass during the heating season at urban and rural sites in Xi'an, respectively. The winter contributions were higher than that during non-heating season. PM2.5 emissions from RCC during heating season were 1.5-4.0 times those during non-heating season for the urban sites, and 2.5 to 6.8 times those for the rural sites. Thus, severe PM pollution in rural areas resulted from intense household coal combustion for space heating. Primary sulfate from RCC was responsible for a large fraction of ambient sulfate during heating season, on average contributing 38.9% and 49.2% of ambient sulfate mass in PM2.5 at urban sites and rural sites, respectively. These results highlight the fact that RCC is an important primary source of atmospheric sulfate during the heating season, and provides information that will improve air quality models and support development of more effective abatement strategies for atmospheric particles.

AB The Sichuan Basin (SB), covering 260,000 km(2) immediately to the east of the Tibetan Plateau (TP) with a large drop exceeding 3000 m in elevation over a short horizontal distance, is a region of high haze pollution in China. The terrain effects of this unique deep basin on haze pollution have not been well investigated. During 14-19 January 2014, heavy haze pollution engulfed the SB with high PM2.5 concentrations. By using the WRF-Chem model, the topographic effects on haze pollution in the SB and the underlying mechanisms were investigated by two sets of simulation with and without the basin topography. The simulation results show that the SB topography lead to an increase of 48 mu g m(-3) in the basin-averaged surface PM2.5 contributing about 44% to the PM2.5 concentrations during heavy haze pollution, indicating an important role of the basin topography in worsening air pollution. The surface PM2.5 level enhancements varied spatially from 0 to 30 mu g m(-3) in the eastern basin to 60-120 mu g m(-3) in the western basin, respectively corresponding to 0-20% and 50-70% relative to the concentrations simulated without the SB topographic condition, reflecting the stronger topographic effect of the TP in the western SB. The topographic effects intensify the haze pollution via reducing wind speed, raising air temperature and humidity in the lower troposphere, as well as dropping boundary layer height in the basin. Resulted from the impact of TP on mid-latitude westerly winds, a typical leeside vortex of immediately upstream TP over the basin was developed with accentuating PM2.5 accumulations in the basin, implying a strong influence of TP on air quality in the SB.

AB We provide continuous records of biomass burning molecular tracers (levoglucosan and dehydroabietic acid) in a Greenland ice core collected from the Southeastern Dome (the SE-Dome ice core) over the past several decades to assess the paleoclimatic utility of these tracers in Greenland ice cores. An air mass backward-trajectory analysis indicates that eastern Canada is likely the primary source region of the biomass burning tracers. Comparisons of levoglucosan and dehydroabietic acid data in the SE-Dome ice core and area burned (vegetation fire) events in Canada suggests that the biomass burning tracers in the ice core document most of the pronounced biomass burning events in eastern Canada over the past several decades, confirming that analyses of biomass burning molecular tracers in Greenland ice cores are useful to reconstruct the frequency of significant biomass burning events in a local region. However, our study also highlights that the wind pattern when the biomass burning occurs is decisive for the registration of a biomass burning event in an ice core even though long-term changes in the wind regime associated with decadal-scale climate oscillations do not significantly influence the transport and deposition of biomass burning tracers on the Greenland ice sheet.

AB A new statistical method, the quadrant method, was used to aid in identifying different conditions affecting the relationship between columnar aerosol optical depth (tau(ext)) and surface concentrations of particulate matter (< 2.5 mu g m(-3) in aerodynamic diameter, PM2.5). The main goal of this study was to identify air pollution sources and atmospheric processes affecting gradients of atmospheric pollutants observed at two valley sites (similar to 1370 m) and a high elevation site (2515 m) located in and adjacent to Reno, Nevada, USA. The two valley sites were used to investigate the horizontal gradient of pollutants associated with mobile sources from high volume highways. Results indicated statistically significant differences in concentrations of criteria air pollutants between the two valley sites, located 0.03 km and > 1 km from major highways. Vertical gradients were impacted by air pollution sources, including local and long-range transport, and atmospheric boundary layer stability. During periods when tau(ext) and surface PM2.5 concentrations were associated (i.e. both increase), emissions from wildfires and local pollutants in a well-mixed boundary layer dominated the relationship. During periods of no association, stable boundary layer conditions and pollution aloft created vertical heterogeneity of PM2.5 concentrations. Results showed that the quadrant method, developed for hourly data, can be used with 24 h PM2.5 and gaseous data and that it is a useful tool for identifying air pollution sources and atmospheric physics driving pollution gradients.

AB Atmospheric particulate matters (TSP and PM2.5) were sampled using quartz fiber filters and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) filters, respectively. Particles deposited on the filters were characterized by a scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX) and an attenuated total reflection FT-IR spectroscopy (ATR-FT-IR). The in vitro inhalation bioaccessibility of TSP- and PM2.5-bound potentially toxic elements (PTEs) on the quartz fiber and PTFE filters with different physico-chemical properties were extracted by four kinds of in vitro inhalation bioaccessibility procedures. SEM-EDX spectra under different magnifications show the heterogeneous distribution and agglomeration of PM2.5 collected on the quartz fiber filter and PTFE filter. Results of ATR-FT-IR show different surface functional groups of PM2.5 deposited on quartz fiber and PTFE filters. 24 h was the optimal interval time for the analyses of in vitro inhalation bioaccessibility of TSP-bound PTEs. The in vitro inhalation bioaccessibility of TSP- and PM2.5-bound PTEs varied greatly among four in vitro inhalation bioaccessibility procedures. The in vitro inhalation bioaccessibility of TSP- and PM2.5-bound PTEs didn't show strong dependence on the quartz fiber filters and PTFE filters with different properties. The in vitro inhalation bioaccessibility procedures have greater influence on the in vitro inhalation bioaccessibility of particle-bound PTEs than the kinds of the sampling filters.

AB The projected increase in global air traffic raises concerns about the potential impact aviation emissions have on climate and air quality. Previous studies have shown that aircraft non-landing and take-off (non-LTO) emissions (emitted above 1 km) can affect surface air quality by increasing concentrations of ozone (O-3) and fine particles (PM2.5). Here, we examine the global impacts of aviation non-LTO emissions on surface air quality for present day and mid-century (2050) using the Community Atmosphere Model with Chemistry, version 5 (CAMS). An important update in CAMS over previous versions is the modal aerosol module (MAM), which provides a more accurate aerosol representation. Additionally we evaluate of the aviation impact at mid-century with two fuel scenarios, a fossil fuel (SC1) and a biofuel (Alt). Monthly-mean results from the present day simulations show a northern hemisphere (NH) mean surface O-3 increase of 1.3 ppb (2.7% of the background) and a NH maximum surface PM2.5 increase of 1.4 mu g/m(3) in January. Mid-century simulations show slightly greater surface O-3 increases (mean of 1.9 ppb (4.2%) for both scenarios) and greater PM2.5 increases (maximum of 3.5 mu g/m(3) for SC1 and 2.2 mu g/m(3) for Alt). While these perturbations do not significantly increase the frequency of extreme air quality events (increase is less than 1.5%), they do contribute to the background concentrations of O-3 and PM2.5, making it easier for urban areas to surpass these standards.

AB West Africa is influenced by northeasterly winds flowing from the Sahara Desert, which transports large quantities of dust into the Sahel by discrete episodic dust events during winter and spring seasons. We investigate the role of horizontal grid spacing in simulating the Particulate Matter with a mass median diameter of less than 10 mu m (PM10) concentrations over West Africa during January through March of 2012 with horizontal grid spacings of 18, 50 and 100 km using the Weather Research and Forecasting model with GOCART (WRF-CHEM). The results are compared to the ground measurements of PM10 in Dakar, Senegal and three AMMA transect sites in Senegal, Mali, and Niger. In general, the 50 km simulations produced the smallest biases in PM10 concentrations, while the largest negative biases are found for 100 km grid spacing during the period especially for Bodele sources. Further, the largest negative biases are found for the eastern Sahel region in Niger at Banizoumbou. We suggest that forecasts or long-term simulations of dust should occur at grid spacing less than 100 km.

AB This study discusses the synoptic situations associated with cases of high pollution in terms of black carbon (BC) concentrations observed at the research site during the four months of the VAMPIRE campaign that is described fully in the companion study by Marin et al. (2017). Cases in which the concentration of BC exceeded the 85th percentile were selected to evaluate composite synoptic situations, resulting in a total of fifteen cases analyzed. These fifteen cases occurred during one of the three prevalent synoptic situations identified and labeled as: i) Coastal low, characterized by weak easterly winds and low planetary boundary layer (PBL) height due to an enhancement of the temperature inversion before the arrival of the coastal low; ii) Pre-frontal, also characterized by low PBL height, with a cold front approaching from the South and the coastal low retreating northwards, also associated with pollution episodes in Santiago (Rutllant and Garreaud, 1995); and iii) SEP anticyclone characterized by large stability, very low gradient in the mean sea level pressure and weak westerly-southwesterly wind due to the dominance of the southeast Pacific anticyclone. Coastal low cases were observed not only during winter but also in all four months of the VAMPIRE field campaign, while Pre-frontal cases were observed only at the end of July and August 2014. All three synoptic situations are consistent with a reduced synoptic forcing, in which the mesoscale sea-land breeze predominates and advects large pollutant concentrations from local/regional emission sources to the research site. Detailed analysis is presented here for two case studies: one Coastal low and one Pre-frontal, combining the observations of pollutants as well as mesoscale modeling with the WRF model to estimate back-trajectories and evaluate the relative role of the synoptic and mesoscale forcing on the pollution episodes in Valparaiso. These synoptic conditions and their interplay with meso-scale circulations identified during VAMPIRE provide evidence and insight that will aid in future air quality forecasts for Valparaiso.

AB This study describes the development of a thermal desorption-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry method for determining the main degradation products of 1,3-butadiene, especially 1,3-butadiene monoxide and 1,3-butadiene diepoxide, in air samples. The method involves the sampling of 6 L of air in a Carbopack X sorbent tube followed by thermal desorption coupled to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Method validation showed good linearity for all the target compounds, low detection limits (ranging between 0.004 ng m(-3) and 0.001 ng m(-3)) and acceptable intra-day (2-10%, n = 5, 2.5 ng) and inter-day (6-17%, n = 5, 2.5 ng) repeatability values. The developed method has been applied for the determination of 1,3-butadiene degradation products at four different sites in a 1,3-butadiene production plant and at three locations in the vicinity of the same production plant. The target compounds were found in both kinds of samples analysed standing out from the rest ones the concentrations found in the 1,3-butadiene production plant (site 1) with a maximum concentration for 1,3-butadiene of 86.7 mu g m(-3), 0.34 mu g m(-3) for 1,3-butadiene monoxide and 1.04 mu g m(-3) for 1,3-butadiene diepoxide. Moreover, the results obtained demonstrate that thermal desorption is a suitable method for the determination of 1,3-butadiene degradation products in air samples.

AB In general, recent certification procedure for regulatory emission limits is used to the standard test cycles in the laboratory under standardized operating conditions. But, it is proving that the real driving emissions (RDE) of vehicles highly exceed the standard emission limits. In order to tackle this problem, RDE regulation has been proposed with the Potable Emissions Measurement Systems (PEMS). In present study, the PEMS (Portable Emissions Measurement System) equipment, which consists of an exhaust gas flow meter, an exhaust gas sampling device, an exhaust gas analyzer, an OBD data acquisition device, GPS and ambient air sensors, and power supplying device, is installed on 17 test vehicles (Euro 6) sold in Korea currently. And two test driving routes (Route A and B) wider 3rd RDE package were developed to include Seoul into urban driving due to reflecting representative traffic and road conditions in Korea. In results, the average NO, emissions of most test vehicles approximately exceeded 6.6 times the emission limit on test routes. Additionally, the on-road NOx emissions of test vehicles by applying SCR during the same trip were not relatively different based on the ambient temperatures. With respect to most test vehicles, the CO2 emissions in the urban section are generally higher than those in the total trip.

AB Land use regression (LUR) models that predict intra-urban variability of traffic-related air pollution are frequently used to inform exposure assessments in epidemiological studies. Spatially extending models built in city centres to unmeasured surrounding areas could be beneficial as it increases the size of area available for exposure assessment, which can improve the statistical power of health studies. However, past studies have shown poor performance when these models were transferred to unmeasured areas. In this study, ambient concentrations of black carbon (BC), ultrafine particles (UFP), nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) with response times ranging from 1 s to 20 s were measured in the summer using a mobile laboratory. These ambient concentrations were temporally deconvolved into local, neighbourhood- and regional-background time-series signals. The temporally resolved signals were used to develop resolved LUR models (i.e. local, neighbourhood-background and regional-background models) while unresolved LUR models were developed from total ambient concentrations (i.e., measurements that were not temporally resolved). Both resolved and unresolved LUR models displayed modest R-2 values when compared to models developed from fixed sites which may be due to the mobile nature of our data. External validation of the resolved and unresolved models within the models' original geographic domain showed comparable performance for BC (R-2 for resolved vs. unresolved: 0.44 vs. 0.47), UFP (0.34 vs. 0.35), NO (0.18 vs. 0.19) and NO2 (0.42 vs.0.40). However, the resolved models were better able to assess exposure than the unresolved models when they were spatially extended to suburban areas bordering the urban area: UFP (R-2: 0.42 vs. 0.29), NO2 (0.36 vs 0.26), NO (0.21 vs 0.14) and BC (0.32 vs 0.30). Furthermore, the resolved models were better able to predict the observed variability in suburban areas with both similar and different land uses to the urban area.

AB Amines play an important role in the formation and transformation of atmospheric aerosols. Gaseous phase and PM2.5 samples were collected simultaneously at Nanling Mountains, southern China during autumn 2016 and summer 2017. The site is strongly affected by long distance transport from marine and continental air masses. Five amines, methylamine (MA), dimethylamine (DMA), diethylamine (DEA), dibutylamine (DBA) and morpholine (MOR), were detected by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) after derivatization. The backward trajectory analyses suggested that different origins of air masses led to seasonal variation of amines. In gaseous phase samples, the average concentrations of total measured amines (Sigma amines) were 193.4 +/- 111.7 ng m(-3) in autumn 2016 and 307.5 +/- 196.7 ng m(-3) in summer 2017. In PM2.5 samples, the average concentrations of Sigma amines were 12.4 +/- 10.8 ng m(-3) in autumn 2016 and 20.7 +/- 11.0 ng m(-3) in summer 2017. MA and DMA were the dominant amines, together contributing approximately 70% to gaseous amines and 80% to particulate amines. A strong linear relationship was found between Sigma amines and NO3- in PM2.5, implying that amines might mainly exist in the form of aminium nitrate. Ammonium (NH4+) was found mostly likely in the form of ammonia sulfate. Approximately 7.4% of the gaseous total amines partitioned to PM2.5. A good linear relationship between the fraction of total atmospheric concentration sorbed by PM2.5 (phi) and the concentrations of O-3 was found, suggesting that O-3 likely played an important factor in the gas-to-particle partitioning of amines. Additionally, under high relative humidity circumstances (92% +/- 7.0%), direct dissolution was a crucial step for gaseous amines partitioning into particles. The ratios of amines-C to water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) and amines-N to water-soluble organic nitrogen (WSON) were 0.21% and 1.57% in autumn 2016 and 0.54% and 2.08% in summer 2017, respectively.

AB The biomass burning marker levoglucosan is produced via combustion of woody cellulose at temperature over 300 degrees C, and is hence widely used to trace fires or discriminate urban air pollution sources. In this context, it is very useful the availability of a standard reference material (SRM) with a certified value of levoglucosan, to check the quality, reliability and accuracy of the measurements.
   To this aim, in this work a simple and rapid method was developed for the detection and quantification of levoglucosan in an urban dust Standard Reference Material 1649a, available from the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the results were compared to those obtained in our previous investigations. 5 mg of SRM particulate material were analyzed, after an ultrasonic extraction with deionized water, using a column, with stationary phase based on hydrophilic interaction, assembled on a liquid chromatography system combined with triple tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) with electrospray ionization. Unlike existing methods, it does not require neither derivatization or extensive clean-up of the sample. For the method validation, the matrix effect, limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantification (LOQ), linearity, accuracy, recovery and precision were evaluated. The concentration determined in the SRM was in good agreement with that determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in our previous study. The precision, tested on SRM, over five replicates and five aliquots were within 15%, whereas accuracy ranged between 85 and 115%. To demonstrate the method is fit for the purpose, particulate matter samples collected in an urban area of the city of Rome Italy were analyzed. The amount of levoglucosan was consistent with the urban emissions typical of the considered season.

AB A comprehensive observation was conducted to reveal the characteristics of submicron and fine aerosols and their chemical components in Beijing in autumn. The potential source contribution function (PSCF) and concentration weighted trajectory (CWT) model, Weather Research & Forecasting (WRF) and Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extension (CAMx) were applied to identify the impacts of emissions from surrounding areas on PM2.5 concentrations in Beijing for different study episodes. These results showed that the monthly average concentration of non-refractory submicron aerosols (NR-PM1 ) was 60.20 +/- 53.48 mu g/m(3), with organics being the major fraction (42.33%), followed by NO3- (22.87%), SO42- (18.70%), NH4+ (12.24%) and CI- (3.86%). The PSCF and CWT analysis indicated common high source regions was located in the western Shandong, northern Henan and southern Hebei, and the distribution of the source areas usually varied with species during different episodes. The regional source apportionment results revealed that 52.36% of surface PM2.5 in Beijing. was contributed by surrounding sources in terms of monthly mean and the outside contribution increased to 64.56% during the haze days, indicating the strong influence of regional transport on Beijing haze pollution. Note that the PM2.5 inflows for Beijing mainly came from Baoding and Langfang, and outflows towards Chengde and Zhangjiakou, identifying two key transport pathways: the southwest-northeast pathway and the southeast-northwest pathway. The PM2.(5) inflow fluxes from surroundings were much higher than outflows from Beijing, leading to the peaking PM2.5 pollution, with the highest concentrations occurring from 00:00 to 11:00 LT, 14 October 2016. Based on the net PM2.(5) fluxes and their vertical distributions, we discovered the PM (2.5) transport mainly occurred at 400-800 m during the entire episode, while at 600-1000 m for a heavy pollution episode, both followed by the southwest-northeast pathway. However, the PM2.5 fluxes were far lower for a clean episode, and followed by the northwest-southeast pathway.

AB Locating and quantifying the hazardous material source plays a significant role in the emergency action plans related to the intentional or accidental release. This issue is the most important in the cities where the threat to peoples health is the highest. In this paper, we present a complete framework to identify in real-time the airborne toxics source in an urban environment. Proposed framework utilizes the adjusted sequential version of the Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) methodology. Dedicated modifications enhanced the estimation of the posterior distributions of contamination source parameters significantly. The source parameters assessments are dynamically updated with the use of on-line arriving concentrations of released substance reported by sensors network. In reconstruction we utilize the advanced Quick Urban & Industrial Complex Dispersion Modeling system (QUIC), developed by Los Alamos National Laboratory, to predict the concentrations at the sensors locations. We validate the proposed methodology on real data coming from a full-scale field experiment DAPPLE conducted in central London in 2007. We confirm the effectivity of the proposed framework by successful estimation of six parameters characterizing the contamination source, i.e., source position (x,y,z) in a city environment, the mass of release (q), the release start time (s) and its duration (l). The presented results prove the utility of the proposed approach for event reconstruction problem in the highly urbanized environment. The presented framework can be adopted quickly during the emergency response planning in any complex urban environment with the use of suitable dispersion model.

AB We investigated the characteristics of the total ozone column (TOC) around West Antarctica (near the Weddell Sea) compared with ambient meteorological factors. For this analysis, we used ground-based and satellite TOC measurements as well as meteorology (air temperature, potential vorticity and wind field) from reanalysis data. Long-term patterns of TOC show the large year-to-year variation (e.g., maximumly similar to 200 DU at King Sejong) but a steady recovering trend recently. Despite a generally consistent pattern, the TOC around West Antarctica did not correlate well between high- and low-latitude regions during austral spring; this result implies that the ozone hole area had a spatial variation over West Antarctica. The TOC pattern around West Antarctica correlated well with air temperature but showed a vertical difference; high positive correlations appeared in the lower stratosphere (maximumly R > 0.9 at similar to 50-100 hPa height) showing enhanced ozone depletion in colder conditions, but negative correlations appeared in the upper stratosphere (minimum R < -0.8 at similar to 5-10 hPa height) associated with the temperature dependence of ozone chemistry. The TOC also showed an interesting relationship to the potential vorticity: high positive correlation in the upper stratosphere (maximumly R > 0.9 at similar to 500-600 K height) during the austral spring but a moderately negative correlation in the lower stratosphere (minimum R < -0.6 at similar to 300-350 K height) during the austral summer. This peculiar pattern probably relates to the polar vortex intensification in the stratosphere and the stratosphere center dot troposphere airmass exchange near the tropopause. There were also some correlations with wind field (R = similar to 0.4-0.6) showing air-mass mixing effects. These findings indicate a large meteorological influence on the spatiotemporal pattern of the TOC in West Antarctica.

AB This study assesses the performance of a large eddy simulation (LES) based on the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) in predicting near field dispersion in street canyons with tree planting. Based on a benchmark test case benefiting from wind tunnel measurements (CODASC), this study qualitatively and quantitatively discusses the prediction of traffic-induced pollutant concentration with respect to several reference studies. It also analyses the physics of the flow and concentration fields. Although the problem might seem rather simple, the flow is highlighted to be strongly three dimensional and transient. These properties enhance pollutant dispersion in the empty street canyon but air flow velocity and turbulence intensity tend to decrease in tree crowns. This effect of trees increases both mean and peak concentration levels at pedestrian level, which may be problematic in cities with dense traffic. These results show that LBM-LES is particularly well suited to study dispersion problems towards the development of more breathable cities.

AB The concentration and deposition of acid from precipitation in Nanjing in the Yangtze River Delta are presented, and their long-term trends are detected based on ground measurements. The wet SO42- deposition was 18.1 kg S ha(-1) yr(-1) from 2015 to 2016, which is much lower than the average across China; and the NO3- deposition was 8.5 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) , which is higher than the national average. Both SO42- and NO3- depositions were relatively high in spring, summer, and autumn, with the lowest occurring in winter. From 1990 to 2016, the averages of SO42- deposition during each Five-year Plan gradually decreased from the 8th (1991-1995) to 12th Five-year Plan (2011-2015), although the annual value did not show a significant decreasing trend due to large variations. Both the annual value and averages of NO3- deposition during each Five-year Plan showed significant increasing trends from 1990 to 2016. The SO42- deposition during the 12th Five-year Plan decreased by 26.5% while the NO3- deposition increased by 182.9% relative to that of the 8th Five-year Plan. These results confirmed that NO3- deposition is still high in the Yangtze River Delta.

AB WRF-Chem (Weather Research and Forecasting with Chemistry Model) is being used to perform air quality forecast over the southeast Brazil with a domain centered in the Metropolitan Area of Sao Paulo (MASP). The simulations are used to understand the pollutants behavior concerning the fluxes to and from the urban areas, to examine the formation of secondary pollutants (e.g., tropospheric ozone), and to validate the efficacy of air quality policies implementation, particularly the ones that are related to the vehicular fuel used in the region. One important factor to improve the air quality simulations is the configuration of suited inflow boundary conditions for the chemical species. In that context, the objective of this study is to assess the impacts of using time-dependent Chemical Lateral Boundary Conditions (CBC) on tropospheric ozone simulations with WRF-Chem. Two simulations were carried out using Carbon-Bond Mechanism version Z (CBMZ). The first simulation was a set-up to run with WRF-Chem default CBC, and the second one using time-dependent CBC obtained from MOZART-4 (Model for Ozone and Related chemical Tracers, version 4) simulations. The period of study was from May 15 to May 18 and from October 30 to November 1, 2006, when a comprehensive experiment with ozonesondes launching and surface measurements was performed. Results show that using MOZART-4 CBC reduced mean bias, RMSE and slightly improved correlation coefficients for ground level ozone as well as ozone vertical profile above 3km. These improvements were more significant during periods with lower photochemical activity. However, underestimation of ozone concentration peaks was also observed in this period, which can be an issue for operational air quality forecasting.

AB Anthropogenic air pollutant emissions have been increasing rapidly in China, leading to severe heavy haze events. In order to predict PM2.5 concentrations accurately, the emissions of precursor gases and primary particles are quite critical but remains large uncertainty. In this study we firstly compared the emissions of precursor gases and primary particles such as sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), ammonia (NH3), carbon monoxide (CO), black carbon (BC), organic compounds (OC), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs), PM(2.5 )and PM10, in three emission inventories (EIs) including INTEX-B (representing the year 2006), MEIC10 arid MEIC12 (representing the year 2010 and 2012) over North China Plain (NCP), one of the most polluted regions in China. It is found that annual total emissions of SO2 decreased 34% (26%) from INTEX-B to MEIC10 (MEIC12), possibly due to effective control and improvement of fuel combustion efficiency conducted in recent years. The NOx emissions increased 53% (58%) from INTEX-B to MEIC10 (MEIC12), and the major contributor to NOx was replaced from power in INTEX-B by industry in MEIC10/12. The VOCs emissions in MEIC10/12 are 21.1% lower than in INTEX-B possibly due to tightened emission standards and operating conditions. The simulations with three EIs, based on WRF-Chem, generally reproduced the observed seasonal variation of PM2.5 concentrations, i.e. high in winter and autumn but low in spring and summer. The spatial distribution from the simulations are overall in good agreement with each other, and the differences less than 20 mu g m(-3) in most regions. The maximums by the simulations with three EIs occur in autumn due to very low wind speed despite the highest emissions in winter. Comparisons in four representative cities indicate that the simulations are quite close to observations in April and July, but overestimate in October and December in all cities exception in Baoding, especially with INTEX-B. Large bias with INTEX-B is possibly because the simulations are compared with observations in 2014 while INTEX-B represents the emission of 2006 year which is more far away from 2014. A quantitative assessment by conducting statistical analysis gave evidence that the simulations with three EIs do not exhibit significant difference in temporal variations, in terms of correlation coefficients, standard deviation, and root-mean-square difference. Therefore, MEIC inventories are suitable for simulations of PM2.5 concentrations for recent years, while INTEX-B might be better for a climate study to simulate the condition decade ago. Temporal variations can be basically well reproduced by either INTEX-B or MEIC10/12 inventories.

AB The mass loading and composition of atmospheric particles are important in determining their climate and health effects, and are typically measured by filter sampling. However, particle sampling under ambient conditions can lead to a shift in the size cut-off threshold induced by hygroscopic growth, and the influence of this on measurement of particle loading and composition has not been adequately quantified. Here, we propose a method to assess this influence based on kappa-Kohler theory. A global perspective is presented based on previously reported annual climatological values of hygroscopic properties, meteorological parameters and particle volume size distributions. Measurements at background sites in Europe may be more greatly influenced by the cut-off shift than those from other continents, with a median influence of 10-20% on the total mass of sampled particles. However, the influence is generally much smaller (< 7%) at urban sites, and is negligible for dust and particles in the Arctic. Sea-salt particles experience the largest influence (median value similar to 50%), resulting from their large size, high hygroscopicity and the high relative humidity (RH) in marine air-masses. We estimate a difference of similar to 30% in this influence of sea-salt particle sampling between relatively dry (RH = 60%) and humid (RH = 90%) conditions. Given the variation in the cut-off shift in different locations and at different times, a consistent consideration of this influence using the approach we introduce here is critical for observational studies of the long-term and spatial distribution of particle loading and composition, and crucial for robust validation of aerosol modules in modelling studies.

AB Compared to the space-borne estimation of PM2.5 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter <2.5 mu m), the investigation of PM (<= 1 mu m) remains less intensive and thus unclear. Here we estimated four years (2014-2017) of ground-level PM1 concentrations from MODIS aerosol optical depth (AOD) in attempt to gain a better understanding of much finer particles. The Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region, with a relatively dense ground-based PM1 station network, was selected as the study area. The geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR) model simultaneously accounting for spatial and temporal variability existing within various predictors was constructed. Validation of satellite-estimated PM(1 )against ground-measured PM1 yields a high consistence, significant improvement over previous work (R-2 = 0.74 VS 0.59, RMSE = 13.02 mu g/m(3) VS 22.5 mu g/m(3)). This suggests the PM1 estimates from GTWR model are reliable and robust enough to obtain large-scale fine particle contents. The population exposure of air pollution in the YRD region, therefore, has been analyzed by calculating population-weighted mean PM1 concentrations, which reaches as high as 37.22 mu g/m(3). Further analysis indicates that near half the people live in locations with high-level PM1 concentration (> 35 mu g/m(3)), which has profounding implication for improving our understanding of human exposure to fine aerosol particles.

AB In the present study we investigate the photochemical properties and impact on cloud water of ferric-aspartate complex (Fe(III)-Asp) under irradiation. Fe(III)-Asp complex was investigated as proxy of ferric-amino acids complexes that could be expected to be present in cloud water. First, the fate of complex under monochromatic (313 and 365 nm) and polychromatic (lambda >= 290 nm) irradiation is investigated and formation quantum yields of Fe2+ are determined. Moreover, hydroxyl radical quantification in the presence of hydrogen peroxide is investigated at cloud water relevant concentrations and under irradiation. Obtained results suggest that hydroxyl radical formation rates are expected to be lower than those obtained considering all iron as aquacomplex or complexed with oxalate. Finally, a phototransformation mechanism for inorganic and organic products formation such as ammonia, malonic, oxalic and formic acids is proposed.

AB Ambient black carbon (BC) has detrimental effects on both human health and near-term global warming. To mitigate these negative effects, there have been significant efforts to reduce emissions of BC from anthropogenic and biomass burning sources in California's Bay Area since the 1960s. Recent reductions in BC have mainly been from fossil fuel combustion sources such as diesel but additional reductions may be needed for contemporary carbon sources like biomass burning and meat cooking. In this study, PM10 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter of less than or equal to 10 mu m) samples were collected at seven sites across the San Francisco Bay Area from November 2011 to October 2012 to create winter and non-winter composites for each site. Radiocarbon (C-14) abundance and chemical mass balance (CMB) modeling were used for source apportionment of ambient elemental carbon (EC, a proxy for BC). The C-14 abundance in the EC fraction was used to quantify the relative contributions of fossil carbon and contemporary carbon sources. The average biomass burning contributions are 48 +/- 8% and 41 +/- 5% for winter and non-winter seasons, respectively, across the Bay Area. Ambient concentrations of EC are approximately two to three times higher during the winter compared to the non-winter season, except for Cupertino. A CMB model, using bulk aerosol composition and select inorganic compounds, was used to understand the contributions of natural gas combustion, gasoline exhaust, and diesel exhaust to fossil carbon as well as the contribution of biomass burning and meat cooking to contemporary carbon. The different apportionment methods for EC (C-14 and CMB analysis) agree within 16 +/- 12% for fraction fossil and biomass burning for both winter and non-winter seasons. The contemporary contribution to EC is much higher than estimated by current emission inventories, suggesting that the inventories may overestimate the contribution from fossil fuels, particularly diesel exhaust. The results from this study are compared to literature values from other C-14-EC or BC studies from across the world.

AB Crop residue burning has been proved to have negative impacts on regional atmospheric environment. In this study, an evidence-based statistical modeling framework was established to quantify potential impacts of crop residue burning in the North China Plain (NCP) on summertime tropospheric ozone increase over East Asia during 2004-2016. To assess the intensity of crop residue burning, fire occurrence counts derived from the MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer onboard the Terra and Aqua satellites were used as a proxy. Additionally, another six factors were employed as potent explanatory variables. Maximum covariance analysis was first applied to decouple spatiotemporal interactions between tropospheric ozone and each explanatory variable. Based on the decoupled modes, multivariate linear regression (MLR) and artificial neural network (ANN) were used to establish statistical relationships between tropospheric ozone and contributing factors, respectively. The results indicate that the ANN-based modeling scheme enables to approximate the observed tropospheric ozone variations better than MLR. Further investigations reveal that the summertime crop residue burning in the NCP is the predominant factor contributing to the observed additive tropospheric ozone increases over East Asia, yielding extra 8% tropospheric ozone elevation on average in June. Moreover, UV radiation and wind also played critical roles in modulating the observed tropospheric ozone variations therein. In general, the critical role of crop residue burning over the NCP in modulating summertime tropospheric ozone increase over East Asia have been well demonstrated based on the proposed evidenced-based modeling framework.

AB Mexico City is a densely populated megacity with average PM10 and PM2.5 levels frequently above those indicated as health-threatening for humans by the World Health Organization. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) can be emitted by anthropogenic sources as the result of the incomplete combustion of organic matter and fossil fuels and they represent an important risk for human health under poor air quality conditions. High concentrations of PAHs have been linked with cancer and other respiratory diseases. Particle-bound PAHs (PPAHs) have been previously studied in Mexico City; however, their temporal scales are not fully understood given the short sampling periods (no more than five weeks) during which time they were evaluated.
   Recent automated and continuous measurements of PPAH concentration made in Mexico City during one full year (April 2016 to March 2017) show an average PPAH concentration of 31.7 +/- 29.9 ng m(-3) at the sampling location. The highest concentrations were observed in the winter corresponding to the cold dry season. On a daily basis, the maximum concentrations were observed between 06:00 and 11:00 am, as high as 495 ng m(-3). The average PPAHs levels measured in the spring of 2016 were found to be ca. 150% higher than those that were measured 13 years previously in the spring of 2003, in approximately the same location and with the same equipment. A conceptual model is introduced to explain the primary processes behind the daily evolution of PPAHs that are produced from primary emissions but whose concentrations decrease due to evaporation and dilution with rising temperatures.
   Given the lack of instrumentation to measure PPAH at most air quality monitoring stations, a proxy is developed based upon correlations with the concentrations of carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrous oxides (NOx), which are typically measured at urban monitoring stations worldwide and that are co-emitted with PAHs. An example application of parametrization with this proxy suggest that people living in the North and Northwest of Mexico City are at greater health risk given that in these locations the PPAH concentrations are expected to be higher than in the rest of the city.

AB Exposure to ambient ozone (O-3) is a risk factor for public health and causes damage to vegetation, including agricultural crops. In this study, we performed a comprehensive estimate of the spatial distribution of premature deaths and main crop yield losses attributed to ambient O-3, across China in 2014, by applying the Global Burden of Diseases approach and AOT40 metric (i.e., above a threshold of O-3 concentration of 40 ppb). Our results show that China's total premature deaths in 2014 due to COPD attributed to O-3 exposure were 89,391 (CI95: 32,225-141,649) with spatial variation across provinces. O-3 induced production losses from all crops were 78.4 million metric tons, and the relative yield losses ranged from 8.5 to 14.0% for winter wheat, 3.9-15.0% for rice, and 2.2-5.5% for maize. The top four Chinese provinces (Sichuan, Shandong, Henan and Hunan) for premature deaths attributed to O-3 pollution also suffered severe losses in yields of winter wheat and rice. Our results provide quantitative evidence of O-3 induced impacts on both the public health and crop yields across Chinese provinces, which have important policy implications for the government to alleviate O-3 pollution in addition to PM2.5 pollution that is currently being addressed.

AB Biomass burning (BB) is an important source of brown carbon (BrC) in atmospheric aerosols. The aim of this study is to investigate the light absorbing ability and oxidative potential of BB-derived BrC fractions (including not only the water soluble fraction but the water-insoluble ones). For this purpose, BrC fractions in the smoke particles (PM2.5) generated from burning of crop residues (rice straw, wheat straw, and corn straw) and wood stems (pine wood and Chinese fir) were sequentially extracted and fractionated into water- and alkaline-soluble extracts, and water- and alkaline-soluble humic-like substances (HULISw5 and HULISAS). Their organic carbon (OC) contents, light absorption, and oxidative potential were comparably investigated. The results showed that the OC within water extracts (WSOC) and alkaline extracts (ASOC), and HULISWS and HULISAS accounted for 24.8%-28.5%, 10.7%-15.3%, 12.4%-16.6%, and 2.2%-5.6% of the BB smoke PM2.5 mass, respectively, thereby indicating that BB potentially influenced the atmospheric water-soluble and alkaline-soluble BrC levels. The BrC fractions had similar absorption patterns, but they also exhibited distinct features. BrC SUVA254 decreased in the order of: HULISA.5 (3.68-4.58 m(2)/gC) > HULISWS (2.99-3.72 m(2)/gC) > WSOC (2.54-2.80 m(2)/gC) > ASOC (1.30-2.06 m(2)/gC). BrC MAE365 was in the order of: HULISA5 (1.95-2.40 m(2)/gC) > HULISw5 (1.12-1.60 m(2)/gC) > WSOC (0.86-1.23 m(2)/gC) and ASOC (0.54-0.95 m(2)/gC). These results suggest that the HULLS fractions exhibited high aromaticity and strong light absorption. Moreover, BB extractable fractions exhibited a strong oxidative potential to generate reactive oxygen species, and the dithiothreitol activity followed the order of: water extracts (12.5-20.6 pmol/min/mu g) > alkaline extracts (9.3-16.2 pmol/min/mu m) > HULISWS (6.6-10.7 pmol/min/g) > HULISAS (3.7-7.1 pmol/min/g). The chemical characteristics of the BB BrC fractions also varied among the biomass types, where the crop residue smoke PM2.5 contained more BrC than wood smoke PM2.5, but the water-soluble BrC in the former generally exhibited weaker light absorption than the latter.

AB Low cost sensors are becoming increasingly available for studying urban air quality. Here we show how such sensors, deployed as a network, provide unprecedented insights into the patterns of pollutant emissions, in this case at London Heathrow Airport (LHR). Measurements from the sensor network were used to unequivocally distinguish airport emissions from long range transport, and then to infer emission indices from the various airport activities. These were used to constrain an air quality model (ADMS-Airport), creating a powerful predictive tool for modelling pollutant concentrations. For nitrogen dioxide (NO2), the results show that the non airport component is the dominant fraction (-75%) of annual NO2 around the airport and that despite a predicted increase in airport related NO2 with an additional runway, improvements in road traffic fleet emissions are likely to more than offset this increase. This work focusses on London Heathrow Airport, but the sensor network approach we demonstrate has general applicability for a wide range of environmental monitoring studies and air pollution interventions.

AB Asian dust (AD) events increase environmental pollution and have a detrimental effect on human health. Particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter < 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) and containing airborne microorganisms increases during AD events due to the transportation of dust by wind from several arid regions in China. This study analyzed the bacterial and fungal communities associated with average daily PM2.5 concentrations less than (on non-event day: ND) and exceeding (on event day: ED) the air quality standard (36 mu g PM(2.5)m(-3)) set by the Korean government. The taxon compositions and functional genes of airborne microorganisms were assessed using shotgun metagenomics sequencing and metagenome rapid annotation using subsystem technology (MGRAST) analysis. MG-RAST is an open source web application, serving as a platform that automatically analyzes uploaded metagenomes. During ND, 51% of total bacteria sequences consisted of those from Proteobacwria, which were closely related to nitrogen-fixing bacterial species. A high percentage of functional genes consisted of those genes related to nitrogen metabolism, suggesting that the airborne microorganisms are associated with environmental nitrogen cycles. During ED, 57% of total bacteria sequences consisted of those from Bacteroidetes, accompanied by high relative abundance of sequences from pathogenic species of Bacillus and Staphylococcus. Fungal sequences were mainly composed of those from the phyla Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, which include spore -forming species transported frequently by wind. The abundance of Ascomycota sequences was higher in ED (81%) than in ND (22%) samples, and mainly included those from the plant pathogens Phaeosphaeria and Pyrenophora. These findings indicated that microbial composition shifted from ND to ED samples, even at the phylum level. This switch was likely due to the sources of dust particles, with those during ED being primarily

AB This study aims to assess the contribution of fossil-fuel combustion (BCff\\) and biomass (or wood) burning (BCwb) to wintertime black carbon (BC) concentrations in Delhi using the "Aethalometer model" approach. Continuous measurements using 7-wavelength Aethalometer (AE-33) were taken from December 2015 to February 2016 in Delhi downtown, as part of a multi-instrument research campaign, revealing high BC concentrations of 24.4 +/- 12.2 mu g m(-3) (range from 3.2 to 59.9 mu g m(-3)). The BCff contribution dominates with an average fraction of 72% at 880 nm, indicating an important contribution from biomass burning (28%). The daily-averaged Absorption Angstrom Exponent (AAE(370-880)) varies between 1.08 and 1.46 due to changes in the BC emission rates, variations in the relative strength between fossil-fuel and wood-burning sources and mixing processes in the atmosphere. The average BCff/BCwb ratio is estimated as 2.90 +/- 1.47 at 880 nm, while the BCwb contribution maximized in the evening hours due to enhanced wood burning for heating. The BC, BCff and BCwb concentrations exhibit remarkable diurnal variations with maximum values in the morning and evening/night hours and lower around noon, primarily driven by changes in the mixing layer height. The highest BC, BCff and BCwb concentrations are associated with weak winds (< 2 ms(-1)), revealing a dominance of local emission sources within the Delhi metropolitan area. A sensitivity analysis is performed by changing the wavelength pairs and the pre-assumed AAE values in order to evaluate the stability of the "Aethalometer model" in assessment of the BC source apportionment. The results reveal that the "Aethalometer model" is more sensitive in estimating the BCwb, while the changes in the BCff component are rather low.

AB A Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) model, which uses the FAO-56 Penman Monteith equation to calculate potential evapotranspiration, has been developed and is considered appropriate for drought monitoring and assessment. However, the correlation of SPEI to total water storage (TWS) across multiple timescales, derived from future climate scenarios, is still unclear for China. In this study, the correlation of SPEI on different timescales (1-, 3-, 6-, 12-, 24- and 48-month) to TWS projected by a global climate model [the Community Climate System Model, version 4 (CCSM4)] under two representative concentration pathway scenarios (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5) for the period 2021-2100 in China is analyzed. The results show that, in general, SPEI is highly correlated with CCSM TWS in most of China (especially in eastern China) at the 12-month timescale, and is therefore regarded as an adequate indicator for representing situations of water resources and evaluating hydrological droughts. At the 12-month timescale, the correlations of SPEI to CCSM TWS vary across different river basins; and the variations in the pattern of correlations are greater due to faster warming and greater precipitation under RCP8.5. It is hoped that this article will provide guidance on the use of SPEI for detecting the impacts of future climate change on drought severity in China.

AB This paper focused on VOCs (referring to C2-C12 hydrocarbons) in Beijing and conducted an integrated comparison study on VOCs concentration, composition, chemical degradation and regional transport impact between haze and non haze days in July and December of 2015, through VOCs monitoring and WRF-Chem modeling simulation. Our monitoring results show that in July VOCs was 20.1% higher in haze days (24.5 +/- 6.6 ppbv) than in non-haze days (20.4 +/- 7.8 ppbv), but VOCs:CO in haze days was 13.4% lower than the non-haze level. The relative change in VOCs:CO from non-haze days to haze days responded negatively to VOCs reaction ability with OH radical (K-OH). Combining VOCs:CO decline during 8:00-14:00 with K-OH, OH level was estimated to increase from 0.75 x 10(6) molec/cm(3) in non-haze days to 1.17 x 10(6) molec/cm(3) in haze days. WRF-Chem simulations calculate the regional transport contribution to Beijing VOCs, averagely - 0.5 ppbv in haze days and 6.3 ppbv in non-haze days in July. These analyses implied a significant VOCs chemical degradation and a weak VOCs regional transport in summer haze days. In December, VOCs reached 91.0 +/- 37.3 ppbv in haze days and 21.4 +/- 14.1 ppbv in non-haze days, and VOCs:CO still dropped by 21.2% lower in haze days. However, the VOCs:CO decrease was mostly contributed by allcanes, acetylene and C4-C5 alkenes. The relative change in VOCs:CO from non-haze days to haze days seemingly responded positively to K-OH values and VOCs chemical degradation was never explicitly found in both haze and non-haze days. Model simulations obtain a higher regional transport contribution to VOCs in haze days (4.4-31.0 ppbv) than in non-haze days (0.5-6.5 ppbv). The winds transport also explained the difference in VOCs composition and VOCs:CO ratio between haze and non-haze days of winter, for prevalent south winds in haze days transporting air masses of South Beijing and South Hebei that were more polluted and characterized by higher proportions of alkenes, aromatics and CO.

AB Using data from the St. Luke's site in Meridian, ID (near Boise) during 2006-2017 and a 2017 summer intensive campaign, we investigate enhancements in ozone (O-3) during wildfire events in an urban area. We calculate a wildfire criterion based on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS) Hazard Mapping System (HMS) smoke product and historically averaged PM2.5 data to determine when wildfire emissions are influencing the area (smoke vs. non-smoke events). We also use a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) to investigate anomalous sources of O-3, such as wildfires, in this urban area. During the summer 2017 intensive campaign, we find that peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN), reactive nitrogen (NO,), and maximum daily 8 h average (MDA8) O-3 show significant enhancements during smoke events compared with non-smoke periods (65%, 42%, and 32%, respectively). We calculate the 95% confidence interval of Delta PM2.5/Delta CO, Delta NOy/Delta CO, Delta PAN/Delta NOy, and Delta PAN/Delta CO enhancement ratios (ERs) to be 0.129-0.144 mu g/m(3)/ppbv, 0.018-0.022 ppbv/ppbv, 0.152-0.192 ppbv/ppbv, and 3.04-3.76 ppbv/ppmv, respectively, for wildfire smoke influenced events. We also observe an enhancement in O-3 production up to PM2.5 concentrations of 60-70 mu g/m(3) in smoke, after which we see a reduction in average MDA8 O-3 mixing ratios. We use the four highest O-3 events during summer 2017 as case studies to examine the highly variable conditions due to the influence of wildfire smoke in an urban area. In two cases, we investigate smoke days that show significant O-3 enhancement and moderate PM2.5 concentrations. These cases suggest that ERs, such as Delta PM2.5/Delta CO and Delta NOy/Delta CO, are less useful in determining the influence of wildfire smoke in an urban area on moderate smoke days. Another case shows reduced O-3 production during a very high, 3-day smoke event (PM2.5 > 70 mu g/m(3)). After this high smoke period, a 20 ppbv enhancement in MDA8 O-3 is observed in moderate smoke. These results indicate that wildfire-influenced O-3 enhancements are highly variable in urban areas but generally increase up to around 60 mu g/m(3) of PM2.5, after which they decrease at very high smoke concentrations. This study also suggests that multiple tracer measurements are needed to fully characterize wildfire plumes in urban areas.

AB Crop residues left as mulch on the soil surface generally increase the risk of ammonia (NH3) volatilization from fertilizer-N, but the roles of mulch as a physical barrier and as a biological support of N transformation are not well known, particularly in response to straw removal. Thus, our goal was to assess how NH3 volatilization from urea-N was affected by different amounts of residues left on the soil surface after harvest in the sugarcane crop by mimicking different rates of straw removal. We ran a replicated field experiment during two consecutive years in the first ratoon sugarcane with 4 amounts of straw (0, 4, 8 and 12 Mg dry matter ha(-1)) and with 0 or 100 kg urea-N ha(-1). Over approximately 2 weeks, we measured the NH3 emissions, levels of inorganic N in soil and water-soluble total N and NH4+ of straw. The dynamics of N in the soil and in straw supported the hypothesis that mulch acts as a physical barrier to the incorporation of urea in soil but also that NH3 emissions occurred directly from the mulch. The NH3 losses were different according to rain pattern of each year, but we showed that the emissions of NH3 were higher with higher amounts of straw (12 > 8 > 4 > 0) for both years (9.2-27.6% in 2016 and 30.7-60.8% in 2017). These results suggest that straw removal contributes to a reduction in NH3-N losses, but since total straw removal is not a recommended practice, N fertilization strategies should be implemented in systems with residue mulches on the soil surface to prevent N loss and to improve the environmental footprint of these cropping systems.

AB The size-resolved hygroscopic properties of submicron particles were observed by a Hygroscopicity Tandem Differential Mobility Analyzer (HTDMA) at an urban site in Beijing in December 2016. HTDMA was operated at the relative humidity (RH) of 30-90% with the particle size range of 30-200 nm. The probability distribution of the hygroscopic growth factor (HGF-PDF) during the measurement usually showed a bimodal pattern, namely, hydrophobic mode (HGF < 1.2) and hydrophilic mode (HGF >= 1.2) with RH >= 70%. The hydrophilic mode particles were usually more dominant for the aged particles. The HGF values were size-dependent and varied depending on particle chemical composition, and the volume-weighted mean HGF could better characterize the relationship between hygroscopicity and chemical composition for the bulk aerosols. The particle mixing state could be also known from the width of HGF-PDF and the particles were mainly externally mixed in this study because a major road with heavy traffic was nearby. For the observed new particle formation events, the HGF values of 30 nm diameter particles at 90% RH showed a decreasing trend, indicating the participation of the organics with weak hygroscopic growth behaviors. During the cumulative stage of heavy aerosol pollution episode, the small particles became more externally mixed and less hygroscopic when influenced by the primary emissions. Meanwhile, the aged particles (e.g., 200 nm) changed to a quasi-internal mixing state affected by the secondary inorganic formation process, which further enhanced the ability of water uptake. Furthermore, the formation of nitrate and ammonium played a more important role in the particle hygroscopicity than sulfate in this work. The size-resolved hygroscopic study revealed that the particles of different sizes underwent different chemical and physical processes in the atmosphere, which was important for understanding the formation and evolution of the severe aerosol pollution in North China Plain.

AB The continuous release of hazardous chemicals to the atmosphere leads to the importance of their analysis in order to understand ambient air quality. In this study, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and pesticide concentrations in the atmosphere were monitored using XAD((R))-2 resin-based passive samplers. The study was performed in three sites in the vicinity of and within Strasbourg, France enclosing a rural site (La Wantzenau), an urban site (the botanical garden of the University of Strasbourg) and a suburban site (Robertsau) during four successive years. Sampling was done between April 22 and May 20 in 2013, April 07 and June 02 in 2014, April 28 and June 09 in 2015, and between April 15 and May 27 in 2016. Results showed a different behavior in pollutants accumulation between the rural and the urban sites. For instance, LMW PAHs were found in rural area while HMW PAHs were found in the urban area mainly due to vehicles emissions. For PCBs analyses, "Robertsau" and the "botanical garden" presented higher concentrations and a higher number of detected PCBs than "La Wantzenau", with total trend for lighter PCBs contribution over the years. Finally, pesticides analyses showed different repartition based on the different pesticides used and arisen from domestic uses of from environmental release and decomposition by the different environmental and meteorological conditions that may have occurred.

AB The ability of regional atmospheric models to accurately represent long-range transport of dust is crucial for describing dust effects on radiation and clouds and for reducing their uncertainties on these processes. The optimized CALIPSO (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations) pure-dust product that provides the three-dimensional patterns of dust and its transport pathways is a unique tool that can address the aforementioned models issues. In this study we use the CALIPSO dust extinction profiles as a tool for examining the performance of the regional dust model BSC-DREAM8b in space and time, for the period 2009-2013 over Northern Africa, the Mediterranean, Europe, Eastern North Atlantic and the Middle East. Our analysis suggests that the model overestimates the dust extinction coefficient above dust source regions in Sahara Desert especially at altitudes lower than 3 km at about 0.041cm(-1). We also found a slight underestimation of transported dust over Europe and Atlantic Ocean lower than 0.025 km(-1) of extinction coefficient values all along the vertical column. Over the Mediterranean dust is overestimated (similar to 0.01 km(-1) ) in layers higher than 1 km height. Dust in the Middle East is significantly underestimated by the model (similar to 0.05 km(-1)) all along the vertical column especially during warm seasons. The study also provides an analysis of the CALIPSO limitations and uncertainties on the detection of strong dust activity contributing to the differences between the simulations and observations above the dust sources of Bodele and Algeria.

AB In this study, we evaluated the emission rates of ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) mass, particle number (PN), and black carbon (BC) from sources at the Ports of Los Angeles (POLA) and Long Beach (POLB), including ships, cargo-handling equipment (CHE), locomotives, and heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs) operating at the ports terminal, as well as from vehicles on the nearby freeways. We also evaluated the impact of these emissions on local air quality (i.e., within the "impact zone" of POLA and POLB), and on the air quality in the Los Angeles County. The impact zone of POLA and POLB was defined as the area confined by the I-105, I-110, and I-710 freeways, and the ports' ship terminals. At the local scale, emission rates were dominated by the sources at the ports (i.e., ships, locomotives, CHE, and HDVs operating at the ports), with overall PM2.5, PN, and BC emission rates of 97.8 +/- 9.8 kg day(-1), 91.6 +/- 10.6 x 10(19) particles day(-1), and 60.3 +/- 5.3 kg day(-1), respectively. Emission rates from sections of the abovementioned nearby freeways were considerably lower, with corresponding values of 8.4 +/- 3.8 kg day(-1) for PM2.5, 2.4 +/- 1.3 x 10(19) particles day(-1) for PN, and 2.0 +/- 1.6 kg day(-1) for BC. However, at the scale of Los Angeles County, the emission rates from total freeways across the Los Angeles County were significantly higher than those of the POLA and POLB, with overall values of 506.9 +/- 20.3 kg day(-1) for PM2.5, 1.9 +/- 0.4 x 10(21 )particles day(-1) for PN, and 119.4 +/- 10.2 kg day(-1 )for BC. Our findings illustrate the major impact of emissions from POLA and POLB on the air quality of communities in the vicinity of the port. However, across the Los Angeles County as a whole, freeway emissions become the most important source of PM2.5, PN, and BC emissions, with emission rates 2-5 times higher than those of source categories at POLA and POLB.

AB Scientists have considered epigenetic modifications as a possible mechanism to deal with adverse effects of air pollution. This study aimed to compare the effect of PM10 (PM with aerodynamic diameter <= 10 mu m) from dust storm and inversion conditions on in vitro global methylation in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). PM10 was sampled in Tehran, Iran, at a point impacted with dust storm and inversion. PM toxicity was determined using the MTT assay. PBMCs were extracted from whole blood of healthy males and treated separately with a mixture of pooled PM(10 )from inversion and dusty conditions at concentrations of 50-300 mu g/mL for 4h. Untreated cells were used as the negative control. Moreover, 5-methylsytosine (%5-mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (%5-hmC) were measured by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. Daily average PM10 concentrations in dusty and inversion days were 348.40 and 220.54 mu g/m(3), respectively. The mean of %5-mC (2.04 +/- 1.49%) was estimated 12 times more than that of %5-hmC (0.17 +/- 0.11%). PM10, resulting from the both sources caused DNA hypomethylation; however, this effect from inversion (median = 3%, IQR = 2.4%) was found to be significantly more than that from dust storm (median = 1.1%, IQR = 1.38%). Moreover, particles increased %5-hmC caused by PM10, which was significantly greater when resulting from inversion (0.23 +/- 0.1%) than from dust storm (0.12 +/- 0.09%). Furthermore, %5-mC and %5-hmC were significantly different at different PM10 concentrations (50-300 mu g/mL) so that a significant difference was observed between %5-mC and %5-hmC at extreme concentrations. Results showed that PM10 from inversion caused a significantly more global methylation than that from dust storm. It can be concluded that measurement of 5-mC and 5-hmC as epigenetic modifications in environmental studies of DNA methylation can be a good procedure to determine health effects related to PM10 exposure.

AB Urban air quality is strongly affected by the surrounding local traffic and emission compounds such as particulate matter (PM) and heavy metals, which pose a serious health risk globally. These compounds are known to be traffic related, but fairly few studies have focused on point source emissions of traffic flow. In this study we applied magnetic biomonitoring using moss bags (Sphagnum papillosum) to study the point source emissions caused by stop-and-go traffic. Moss bags were placed alternately at traffic light crossings (n = 19) and midway areas between the crossings (n = 29) along four street transects and one separate traffic light crossing in the city of Turku, Finland. Samples were analysed for mass-specific magnetic susceptibility (chi), hysteresis parameters and elemental components. The PM was composed of fine-grained pseudo-single-domain (PSD) magnetite and the concentrations of chi, Cu, Mo and Sb significantly differed between traffic light crossing areas compared to midway areas. The elements Ba, Cu, Fe, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb and Ti showed moderate to high levels of accumulation and correlated strongly with chi and saturation magnetisation (M-s). Our results show that a high volume of stop-and-go traffic is a major source of harmful PM pollution especially along busy main roads. To improve urban air quality and public health we strongly advice the municipal administrations to pay more attention to urban planning and traffic management to reduce stop-and-go traffic and decrease the levels of urban PM pollution.

AB Cities in mainland Southeast Asia have long faced smog problems. Developing effective control strategies for smog reduction has been a challenge for academics and policy makers. In this study, emission control measures were assessed using both the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) and Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ) modeling systems during a smog episode between 1st and 31st of March 2012. The study found that there was a strong impact from biomass burning outside of the city on PM concentrations within the city, with contributions of approximately 85% and 89% for PM10 and PM2.5 respectively. Control of biomass burning in the city significantly affects local PM concentrations. This study investigated the success of biomass burning control inside the city when no biomass is burned outside of the city. The control scenarios focused on specific reduction levels in biomass burning emissions, which included 0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80% and 100%. The results yielded the following rates: the mean PM2.5 concentrations decreased by 0.70% per %decrease of biomass burning emission; the maximum daily average PM2.5 concentrations decreased by 0.84% per %decrease of biomass burning emission; and the average percentage of PM2.5 concentrations that exceeded the NAAQS decreased by 1.05% per %decrease of biomass burning emission. This information provide good guidelines for successful decision-making at each control level to solve the problems related to of smog in cities. However, smog problems cannot only be solved by emission control measures in the city; biomass burning must also be reduced on a regional scale.

AB This study investigated the causes behind the nighttime ozone biases in southeast Texas, including background ozone, the land use/land cover (LULC) change and the minimum nighttime eddy diffusivity coefficient (Kzmin) setting. It also tried to shed light on a historical issue of large ozone biases by tracing the history of Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model's treatment of Kzmin. The ozone biases associated with the low and active ozone days are distinctively different through examination of their diurnal cycles. Hence the model background ozone bias is likely responsible for ozone bias at the regional level. Significant differences in PBL height, vertical mixing, dry deposition and spatial patterns of ozone biases were found in two LULC cases. Spatial patterns of nighttime eddy diffusivity and dry deposition are consistent with the underlying LULC data. By using the default Kzmin setting which lowering the nighttime vertical mixing, the average ozone bias is reduced as compared to the alternative Kzmin setting. The reduction is 3.7 ppb or 31% when the latest National Land Cover Database (NLCD) 2011 is used. Still biases as high as 20 ppb exist at a number of sites. There are minimal changes in ozone biases in inner city and coastal sites while the changes in some rural/suburban sites are substantial. Also higher sensitivity was observed when preceding day ozone was high. The results showed that both downward mixing of ozone above and dilution of surface NO are important processes for nighttime ozone. By comparing the spatial bias pattern of 2006 and 2015, we are fairly certain the high nighttime eddy diffusivity in the old simulation played a significant role in the large nighttime biases. The impacts from the uncertainties in dry deposition can be medium while uncertainties caused by model horizontal advection are likely less significant. Factors other than background ozone mostly contribute to the local level biases.

AB In non-desert areas primary biological aerosol particles, including pollen, are an important source of phosphorus (P). During the flowering season large quantities of pollen from wind pollinated trees, are observed in boreal and temperate lakes and forest, which contain high P concentrations. However, there are different estimations for the contribution of pollen to the atmospheric P cycle, and there is no accepted method for the identification of phosphate from pollen origin. In this study we measured the P concentrations in pollen from various locations. In addition, the oxygen stable isotopes ratio in phosphate (delta O-18(p)) was measured for the first time for both the bioavailable pool (P extractable by anion-exchange resin), and for the HCI-extractable pool. The resin and HCl-extractable delta O-18(p) values were on average (+/- SE) 25.6 +/- 3.4%o, and 25.8 +/- 2.9%o, which are distinctively higher than mineral dust delta O-18(p) values (average 22.1 +/- 0.7%o). Pollen unique isotopic signature in phosphate can be used as a tool to identify P in aerosols from pollen origin, and hence to better understand the atmospheric P cycle. The high P concentrations found in this study (average ( +/- SE) resin-P and HCl-P values were 0.67 +/- 0.10 and 0.75 +/- 0.9 mg P g(-1)), confirm that pollen is important to the atmospheric P budget, and can help to solve the uncertainties regarding its role in the global P cycle.

AB The household second hand smoke problem is still severe in China due to the large number of smokers and the prevalence of smoking at home. We selected ten Chinese cigarettes, including seven best-selling products of different brands and three types of products of the same popular brand, to measure the emission rates of ultrafine particles (UFPs: particulate matter with diameter less than 0.1 pm) and fine particles (PM2.5: particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 pm) with the help of two habitual smokers. The emission rate of UFPs generated from smoking popular Chinese cigarettes was 2.51 +/- 0.50 x 10(12) #/min or 1.98 +/- 0.30 x 10(13)#/cigarette, and the emission rate of PM2.5 was 2.25 +/- 0.39 mg/min or 17.63 +/- 1.56 mg/cigarette. The emission rates of UFPs and PM2.5 from Virginia-type cigarettes were higher than those from blended-type and exotic flavor-type cigarettes of the same brand. The emission rates of UFPs and PM2.5 from Chinese cigarettes were higher than those from Western cigarettes. The measured UFP5 and PM2.5 emission rates from human smoking of Chinese cigarettes can be used to assess the population exposure and design control measures in residences.

AB Fine particulate matter (PM2.5; <= 2.5 rn in aerodynamic diameter) stands out among all pollutants as more directly responsible for long-term health problems. This work aims to evaluate the public health benefits of improved air quality in Brazil, based on the estimated reduction in mortality from PM2.5, a pollutant commonly related to all causes mortality including non-accidental, cardiovascular, ischemic heart diseases and lung cancer. Annual PM2.5 concentrations were obtained from 50 monitoring stations spread across 24 Brazilian cities between the years 2000 and 2017, which constituted the baseline scenario. The control scenario was represented by the annual PM2.5 guideline values (10 mu g m(-3)) of the World Health Organization (WHO). The relationship between the change in baseline and control scenarios with health effects was estimated using the BenMAP-CE program and the application of exposure-response functions. Sao Paulo city showed the highest number of avoidable deaths, with values ranging from 28,874 +/- 9769 and 82,720 +/- 24,549 for all causes from 2000 to 2017. In 2009, just three Brazilian cities were monitoring PM2.5. Between 877 +/- 295 and 2497 +/- 719 all causes avoidable deaths related to PM2.(5) were estimated under the scenario when the WHO guideline was applied. In 2017, the 15 cities with representative annual PM2.5 data account for between 2378 +/- 801 and 6282 +/- 1818 avoidable deaths due to all-cause PM2.5 mortality, between 2974 +/- 376 and 10.397 +/- 516 avoidable deaths due non -accidental causes, between 1373 +/- 230 and 3428 +/- 265 avoidable deaths due cardiovascular disease, between 927 +/- 162 and 2514 +/- 156 avoidable deaths due ischemic heart diseases and the lowest between 101 +/- 45 and 264 +/- 88 avoidable deaths due to lung cancer.

AB Temporal and seasonal variabilities in black carbon (BC) mass concentrations, equivalent BC from fossil fuel (BCff) and wood burning (BCwb) are investigated using multiwavelength aethalometer measurements made over urban (Ahmedabad) and high altitude remote (Gurushikhar) sites in western India during 2015-2016. BC, BCff and BCwb mass concentrations exhibit strong diurnal variation over Ahmedabad compared to Gurushikhar. Annual mean contribution of BCff to total BC mass concentration is estimated to be 80 and 72% respectively over Ahmedabad and Gurushikhar, which indicates the dominance of fossil fuel emissions. To delineate the impact of BC aerosols on the Earth atmosphere radiation budget aerosol radiative forcing due to composite aerosols, and BC aerosols alone is estimated. Maximum atmospheric forcing due to BC is observed during December (15 Wm(-2)) and November (8 Wm(-2)) over Ahmedabad and Gurushikhar respectively, because BC mass concentration is highest in the respective months. Surface composite forcing is higher during postmonsoon (-27 Wm(-2)) and premonsoon (-16 Wm(-2)) over Ahmedabad and Gurushikhar respectively due to high aerosol optical depths. BC aerosols contribute similar or equal to 60% to the shortwave atmospheric forcing. The present study shows that the large spatial and temporal variation in BC mass concentrations over an urban and high altitude remote site can produce significant regional variabilities in aerosol radiative effects.

AB Urban development, growing industrialization, and increasing demand for mobility have led to elevated levels of air pollution in many large cities in Latin America, where air quality standards and WHO guidelines are frequently exceeded. The conurbation of the metropolitan area of La Paz/El Alto is one of the fastest growing urban settlements in South America with the particularity of being located in a very complex terrain at a high altitude. As many large cities or metropolitan areas, the metropolitan area of La Paz/El Alto and the Altiplano region are facing air quality deterioration. Long-term measurement data of the equivalent black carbon (eBC) mass concentrations and particle number size distributions (PNSD) from the Global Atmosphere Watch Observatory Chacaltaya (CHC; 5240 m a.s.l., above sea level) indicated a systematic transport of particle matter from the metropolitan area of La Paz/El Alto to this high altitude station and subsequently to the lower free troposphere. To better understand the sources and the transport mechanisms, we conducted eBC and PNSDs measurements during an intensive campaign at two locations in the urban area of La Paz/El Alto from September to November 2012. While the airport of El Alto site (4040 m a.s.l.) can be seen as representative of the urban and Altiplano background, the road site located in Central La Paz (3590 m a.s.l.) is representative for heavy traffic-dominated conditions. Peaks of eBC mass concentrations up to 5 mu g m(-3) were observed at the El Alto background site in the early morning and evening, while minimum values were detected in the early afternoon, mainly due to thermal convection and change of the planetary boundary layer height. The traffic-related eBC mass concentrations at the road site reached maximum values of 10-20 mu g m(-3). A complete traffic ban on the specific Bolivian Day of Census (November 21, 2012) led to a decrease of eBC below 1 mu g m(-3) at the road site for the entire day. Compared to the day before and after, particle number concentrations decreased by a factor between 5 and 25 over the particle size range from 10 to 800 nm, while the submicrometer particle mass concentration dropped by approximately 80%. These results indicate that traffic is the dominating source of BC and particulate air pollution in the metropolitan area of La Paz/El Alto. In general, the diurnal cycle of eBC mass concentration at the Chacaltaya observatory is anti-correlated to the observations at the El Alto background site. This pattern indicates that the traffic-related particulate matter, including BC, is transported to higher altitudes with the developing of the boundary layer during daytime. The metropolitan area of La Paz/El Alto seems to be a significant source for BC of the regional lower free troposphere. From there, BC can be transported over long distances and exert impact on climate and composition of remote southern hemisphere.

AB Fluxes of carbon monoxide (CO) were measured using a fast-response quantum cascade laser absorption spectrometer and the eddy covariance method at a long-term intensively grazed grassland in southern Scotland. Measurements lasted 20 months from April 2016 to November 2017, during which normal agricultural activities continued. Observed fluxes followed a regular diurnal cycle, peaking at midday and returning to values near zero during the night, with occasional uptake observed. CO fluxes correlated well with the meteorological variables of solar radiation, soil temperature and soil moisture content. Using a general additive model (GAM) we were able to gap fill CO fluxes and estimate annual fluxes of 0.38 +/- 0.046 and 0.35 +/- 0.045 g C m(-2) y(-1)g C m(-2) y(-1) for 2016 and 2017, respectively. If the CO fluxes reported in this study are representative of UK grasslands, then national annual emissions could be expected to be in the order of 61.91 (54.3-69.5) Gg, which equates to 3.8% (3.4-4.3%) of the current national inventory total.

AB The marine aerosols is mainly produced primary sea salt and secondary form of non-sea salt (nss) sulfate and organic species from marine emission, but get modified significantly by the anthropogenic and terrestrial materials, such as total carbon (TC) and total nitrogen (TN), which transported by the atmospheric circulation from land to the ocean. Rarely studies focus on the TC and TN in marine aerosol in the open ocean due to the sampling difficulty, let alone the annual observation. Concentrations of TC and TN, and their isotope compositions (delta C-13-TC and delta N-15-TN) were measured in total suspended particulate (TSP) which sampled at Yongxing Island over the South China Sea from March 2014 to February 2015, and coastal mega-city Guangzhou in April/May and October/November 2014. The annual average concentrations of TC and TN at Yongxing Island were 4.20 +/- 2.38 mu gm(-3) and 0.77 +/- 0.47 mu gm(-3), respectively. Much higher concentration of TC and TN were observed at Guangzhou. Contributions of NO3- and NH4+ (inorganic nitrogen, IN) to TN at Yongxing Island averaged 55.7% and 6.8%, respectively, while they averaged 27.4% and 12.2% at Guangzhou, respectively. The average values of delta N-15 in TN were +0.7 +/- 3.3 parts per thousand, +6.8 +/- 6.3 parts per thousand and -0.7 +/- 2.7 parts per thousand during winter, transitional and warm seasons, respectively, with an annual average value of +1.1 +/- 4.3 parts per thousand. The delta C-13 of TC varied from - 16.2 to -26.8 parts per thousand, with an annual average value of - 22.7 parts per thousand. The average of values of delta C-13 were - 22.9 +/- 1.7 parts per thousand, - 22.9 +/- 1.4 parts per thousand, and - 22.4 +/- 2.6 parts per thousand during winter, transitional and warm seasons, respectively. The average values of delta N-15 in TN and delta C-13 of TC were + 13.2 +/- 0.9 parts per thousand and - 25.8 +/- 0.4 parts per thousand in winter season, +13.6 +/- 0.8 parts per thousand and -26.5 +/- 0.3 parts per thousand in warm season at Guangzhou, respectively. Based on aerosol delta N-15 and delta C-13 values, the marine realm may be an important source of aerosol TN, while aerosol TC may dominantly contributed by the combustion of fossil fuels and biomass burning from continental mass over the South China Sea. The secondary aerosol formation and long-range transport on aerosol chemistry also varied the concentrations and isotopic composition of TN and TC at Yongxing Island.

AB In 2016, three Nigerian cities were listed amongst the World's most polluted in terms of particulate matter (PM). Acknowledging Nigeria's limited resources for outdoor air pollution monitoring, this study attempts to investigate the effects on atmospheric aerosol optical depth and ground PM on GPS derived-precipitable water vapour estimates. The study utilized available GPS-derived precipitable water vapour (GPS(PWV)), the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer aerosol optical depth (MODISAOD) and the ground level particulate matter of less than 10 mu m (GPM) datasets for December 2015-November 2016. All the datasets were tested for normality. To evaluate the atmospheric aerosol properties, the MODISPWV estimates were pre-validated using the GPS(PWV) measurements. The results revealed GPS(PWV)-MODISPWV agreement (R = 0.964; RMSE = 3.810 mm). The GPS(PWV)-MODISAOD analysis showed relationship (R <= -0.636; RMSE <= 0.563) for the atmospheric aerosol experiment, while the collocating GPS(PWV)-GPM seasonal analysis also revealed significant correlation (R < -0.660). The correlation of combined seasonal datasets for the GPS(PWV)-MODISAOD and GPS(PWV)-GPM relationships showed high negative correlation values of 0.79 and 0.68 respectively. The findings of this study is in agreement with similar related studies, as well as serve as position accuracy for future related studies.

AB To investigate the impact of biomass burning (BB) emissions on total suspended particulate (TSP) in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau (TP), BB tracers (including levoglucosan, mannosan, and galactosan) were measured at Lulang (a remote site, similar to 3300 m above sea level) during the period 2015-2016. The concentrations of levoglucosan and mannosan showed large variability of more than 8-fold (range: 0.029-0.253 mu g m(-3)) and 6-fold (range: 0.01-0.061 mu g m(-3)), respectively. The highest seasonal average concentrations of levoglucosan (0.131 +/- 0.073 g m-3) and mannosan (0.028 +/- 0.019 mu g m(-3)) were observed during the winter season. The BB contributions to the TSP organic carbon (OC) and TSP mass were estimated with positive matrix factorization (PMF) by using BB tracers, inorganic ions, elements, OC, and EC. The BB contributions to the TSP OC and TSP mass were quite substantial in winter with 26% and 14%, respectively. The results evidenced a major contribution of BB to the aerosol OC during winter season. Major potential source distributions of BB were identified, which included the pollution bands along the Indo-Gangetic Plain, the Yarlung Tsangpo River Valley and the interior of the TP. In addition to the long-range transport of BB, the sources of anthropogenic emissions (residential BB for cooking and heating) in the TP may be an important contributor. The results facilitated understanding of the characteristics and effects of BB in the TP.

AB Secondary aerosols often dominate fine aerosol mass, elucidation of their chemical characteristics is thus important. In this work, we measured submicron aerosols (PM1) by using an Aerodyne high resolution soot-particle aerosol mass spectrometer during late winter (February-March 2015), in a suburban site of Nanjing, China surrounded by industry plants. We found that under such environment, PM1 was predominantly comprised of secondary species (on average 80.6%). Investigations on the relationships of nitrate/sulfate and relative humidity (RH) suggest that moisture can play a significant role to enhance their formations. The organic aerosol (OA) occupied similar to 1/4 of total PM1 mass, and primary OA (POA) and secondary OA (SOA) contributed almost equally. The most abundant OA factor, which was the one with highest oxidation degree, responded positively to RH but not to photochemical activities, indicating it was driven by aqueous-phase processing; while the other two less oxygenated SOA factors behaved oppositely, probably were governed by photochemical processing. Peak sizes of sulfate, nitrate and OA all shifted towards larger sizes with the increases of RH, again reflecting the effects of aqueous-phase processing. Overall, aqueous-phase driven secondary aerosols appeared to be very important in enhancing PM1 pollution, while photochemical processed SOA was important to OA pollution, leading to a fresher OA at higher OA concentrations. We further demonstrated the influences of aqueous-phase and photochemical processes on secondary aerosol characteristics by using two cases, respectively. This work points out the importance of aqueous-phase chemistry on sulfate and nitrate formations, and different portions of SOA can be dominated by different mechanisms in an industrialized environment.

AB Wood processing has been known to emit a large amount of inhalable wood dust, but the emissions of particles with diameters smaller than 10 mu m and ultrafine particles (UFP, particles with diameters smaller than 100 nm), as well as their exposure levels, remain unclear. The present study measured the particle profiles from 5.6 nm to 10 gm from wood processing in a pilot plant and in the wood industry, respectively. Large increase of particle number concentrations (PNC) was observed during pilot scale refinery, flaking, cross hammer mill, chipping and sawing, but not during sieving, drying, gluing and pressing, when comparing with background PNC. In the wood industry (one sawmill and one wood-based panel factory), we observed high PNCs, and in some production sites (chipping, MDF form station, MDF press station) high particle mass concentrations (PMCs). Human respiratory tract deposition modelling showed that the deposition of the particle surface area in the size range of 0.3-10 mu m was mainly in the extrathoracic region, and the particle surface area in the size range of 5.6-560 nm was mainly deposited in the alveolar interstitial. Exposure of a few minutes when processing wood in the pilot plant can lead to a high particle dose. The particle dose for an 8-h exposure in the wood industry was much higher than urban background exposure scenarios, in some workplaces by a factor of about 50-100. This study gives first evidence that wood processing could emit a large number of UPF and particles < 10 mu m. Our results indicate that the current mass-based occupational exposure limit for wood dust is not able to reveal the high exposure to UFP and particles < 10 mu m.

AB Modern anthropogenic aerosols usually exhibit low but significant Delta 33S signatures (-0.6 to 0.5460) whose origin still remains unclear. While isotope fractionation factors associated with the oxidation of SO2 by O-2+ TMI (Transition Metal Ion), H2O2 or OH cannot lead to such extreme Delta S-33-values, an increasing number of studies points to the significant role of NO2 as a contributing oxidant, especially in the urban environment.
   To address the possible relation between atmospheric NO2 and observed Delta S-33-values in aerosols, we carried out laboratory experiments oxidizing SO2 by NO2 at temperatures ranging between 7 and 52 degrees C. Our results show that at temperatures >= 10 degrees C SO2 oxidation by NO2 is characterized by 1) a (34)alpha-value whose temperature dependence (0.2437/T+0.0457) is distinct from those related to oxidation by O-2+ TMI, H2O2 and OH oxidation pathways and 2) (33)beta (0.514 +/- 0.0003) and 3613 (1.90 +/- 0.002) values that are closer to the mass dependent values (0.515 and 1.89 respectively) than those reported for the other oxidation pathways. This implies that the NO2 oxidation pathway cannot explain the extreme Delta S-33-values measured in urban aerosols.
   Our data show that if atmospheric SO2 oxidation by NO2 is neglected, both the O-2(+) TMI and OH oxidation pathways would be overestimated in urban areas. Finally, we conclude that another oxidation reaction is responsible for the high Delta S-33-values measured in urban aerosol samples.

AB Indoor go-karting is a popular free time activity for many people, including adults and children. Particulate matter from engine emissions, brake and tire debris and gaseous pollutants are important sources of air pollution. Exposure to these air pollutants is associated with health-related problems. In this study, the exposure of employees and spectators to particulate matter was measured in 8 indoor go-kart facilities (6 facilities used gasoline, one used liquid gas and one used electricity for their go-karts). The mass concentrations of particulate matter were continuously analyzed. Particles were sampled and analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and electron microscopy coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The mean PM10 concentrations ranged between 4.9 and 34.9 mu g/m(3) for workplaces and 5.6 and 28.4 mu g/m(5) for spectator areas. The mean PM2.5 concentrations measured in workplaces ranged from 2.3 to 29.2 mu g/m(3) and from 2.4 to 27.4 mu g/m(3) in the spectator areas. The highest PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations were measured at the liquid gas go-kart facility and at go-kart facilities with the maximum number of go-karts running simultaneously. The electric go-kart facility showed high PM10 concentrations but low PM2.5 values. The highest particle number concentration was measured in the workplace of the facility using liquid gas go-karts (2.7 x 10(5) particles/cm(3)), and the lowest concentration at both measurement points of the electrical go-kart facility (1.8 x 10(4) particles/cm(3)). Metals such as copper, zinc, strontium, barium, aluminum, calcium, manganese, iron and nickel were found in nearly all samples with help of inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The most abundant metal was iron, with concentrations up to 5.6 mu g/m(3) (electric go-kart facility). Electron microscopic investigations showed high concentrations of soot in all samples, except for the samples of the electric go-kart facility. Additionally, agglomerates with iron and other metals were found in all samples. To summarize, electric go-karts, combined with a good ventilation system, seem to be more suitable for indoor use.

AB The EuNetAir Joint Exercise focused on the evaluation and assessment of environmental gaseous, particulate matter (PM) and meteorological microsensors versus standard air quality reference methods through an experimental urban air quality monitoring campaign. This work presents the second part of the results, including evaluation of parameter dependencies, measurement uncertainty of sensors and the use of machine learning approaches to improve the abilities and limitations of sensors. The results confirm that the microsensor platforms, supported by post processing and data modelling tools, have considerable potential in new strategies for air quality control. In terms of pollutants, improved correlations were obtained between sensors and reference methods through calibration with machine learning techniques for CO (r(2) = 0.13-0.83), NO2 (r(2) = 0.24-0.93), 03 (r(2) = 0.22-0.84), PM10 (r(2) = 0.54-0.83), PM2.5 (r(2) = 0.33-0.40) and SO2 (r(2) = 0.49-0.84). Additionally, the analysis performed suggests the possibility of compliance with the data quality objectives (DQO) defined by the European Air Quality Directive (2008/50/EC) for indicative measurements.

AB Trajectory-based statistical models (TMs) are widely used to locate source areas responsible for atmospheric pollution at receptor sites. In order to study the influence of long, medium and short-range back-trajectories (BTs) on geographical sources location, an original approach was applied to daily PM10 concentrations measured for 5 years (2009-2013) at 12 receptor sites in the Hauts-de-France (HdF) region bounded on the south by the Paris megacity and on the north by the Benelux countries. The methodology used was based on two complementary TMs, Concentration Field (CF) and Potential Source Contribution Function (PSCF), and included several meaningful constraints in order to improve the spatial representativeness and the statistical significance of the potential source maps. The selection of BTs depending on the occurrence of scavenging precipitations ( > 1 mm h(-1)) during the transport of air masses and altitude limitations with respect to the planetary boundary layer height led to more realistic maps. The variability of the density of BT endpoints was accounted for by a weighting function which highlighted medium-distant yet recurring (e.g. Benelux and West of Germany) potential sources of PM10. Investigating the effect of short-range BTs (75% of endpoints within a radius of 500 km from the receptor sites) pointed out at nearby large conurbations (Lille and Paris areas). Comparing our potential source maps with European PM10 emission inventory maps as well as PM10 measurements at European background monitoring stations for similar periods confirmed our results for Central Europe, the Benelux and the East of Germany. This study showed how the combination of several receptor sites enables the determination of potential source areas impacting a whole region. It pointed out also that the fine-tuned parametrization of the CF and PSCF TMs may considerably help improving the knowledge on geographical location of sources related to long, medium and short-range BTs and could be easily implemented for other regions of interest.

ID OZONE
AB Regulations, definitions, and calculations related to emissions of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) from paints used for horizontal road markings (traffic paints) in North America and in European Union are different, which frequently makes simple comparisons impossible. To illustrate the dissimilarities, solvent packages of various exemplary paints that meet several normative requirements were compared for the nominal emissions according to different calculation procedures. For a unified assessment, volatile portions of the paints were evaluated based on Ozone Formation Potential (OFP). The analysis revealed that similar nominal VOC contents can lead to vastly different OFP, in an extreme case six times higher. Incongruously high OFP, which was calculated for emissions in Southern California despite strict limits can thus be explained. The provided calculations can be used by road administrators as a tool to demand materials with lowest environmental impact, by environmental researchers to pinpoint irregularities between declared and measured discharges, and can assist formulating chemists in selection of raw materials to prepare environmentally friendly road marking paints.

AB Oxidative potential (OP) of particulate matter measures the ability of particles to catalytically generate reactive oxygen species while simultaneously depleting antioxidants, leading to oxidative stress and, in turn, inflammation in the respiratory tract and cardiovascular system. OP measurements have been linked with adverse cardiorespiratory endpoints, such as asthma/wheezing, lung cancer, and ischemic heart disease. However, measurements of OP are limited, restricting the area over which epidemiologic analyses can be performed. In this work, a modeling approach is developed and evaluated that uses limited measurements of water-soluble OP and PM2.5 source impact analysis to estimate OP over a large spatial domain (eastern United States). The dithiothreitol (DTT) assay was used to measure daily OP of water-soluble PM2.5 from June 2012 to July 2013 across four sites in the southeastern United States. Daily PM2.5 source impacts were estimated using CMAQ-DDM during the same time period and related to OPDTT measurements via multivariate linear regression. This regression was then applied to spatial fields of daily CMAQ-DDM source impacts across the eastern United States to provide daily spatially-varying OPDTT estimates. Backward selection during regression development showed vehicle and biomass burning emissions to be significantly predictive of OPDTT as observed in previous studies. The fire source impact was the largest contributor to OPDTT (29%) across the study domain during the study time period, and both spatial and seasonal variations were largely driven by fires. Vehicular impacts, especially diesel impacts, were more significant in urban areas. This CMAQ-DDM modeling approach provides a powerful tool for integrating OP measurements from multiple locations and times into a model that can provide spatio-temporal exposure fields of OPDTT across a wide spatial domain for use in health analyses, and the results offer insight into the large-scale spatial distribution of OPurr driven by emission source impacts.

AB Isoprene is a crucial precursor of secondary organic aerosols (SOAs) that reacts with radicals or oxidants such as OH, O-3, and NO3. The reaction mechanisms under various conditions have been elucidated through years of research. In this study, the UV-vis light absorptive ability of oxydates for isoprene was calculated at the PBE1PBE/6-311g (d) level using Gaussian 09. The results indicated that reactions of isoprene with OH and O-3 would produce less absorptive organics; the intensity of the absorption peaks and the maximum absorption wavelength decreased relative to those of the precursor. The oxydates formed from isoprene through an NO3-initiated reaction had different light absorption properties. The optical properties of the oxydates exhibited a bathochromic shift and hyperchromic effect relative to those of the precursor. NO3 mainly originated from vehicular traffic, indicating that anthropogenic activity heavily affected the formation of oxydates and light absorption. The light absorption properties and irradiation effect of SOAs caused by isoprene heavily depended on the reaction route. Transformation of functional groups was the dominated factor in photobleaching and photoenhancement of oxidative products. This study provides a detailed mechanism that explains the changes in optical absorption properties during isoprene oxidation.

AB In the present study, Polonium-210 (Po-210) is studied in TSP and coal combustion samples for its potential application in tracing air pollutants. A significant seasonal variation of atmospheric Po-210 in Beijing was observed: winter > autumn > summer > spring. During the combustion of coal, Po-210 was highly enriched in fly ash but was depleted in bottom ash. Using selenium (Se) as an indicator of coal combustion, significantly positive correlation between Po-210 and Se in TSP samples (r(2) = 0.705) revealed that coal combustion was a primary source of atmospheric Po-210 in Beijing. The mean emission factor of Po-210 from industry sector was found to be the highest (1.15 Bq kg(-1)), followed by the residential (0.308 Bq kg(-1)) and coal-fired power plant (0.0776 Bq kg(-1)) sectors. The annual emission inventories of Po-210 from three coal consumer sectors (residential, coal-fired power plant, and industry) in 2016 in Beijing were estimated to be 1.49, 0.0729, and 1.36 GBq, respectively. The ratio of radioactive Po-210 and stable element Se (Po-210/Se) was creatively used as a combined indicator or fingerprint of coal combustion emission, which will contribute to the development of radioisotope tracer technology based on nuclide fingerprint database in the source identification of air pollutants.

AB Nitrate, a member of the oxidized nitrogen family (NOy), is one of the primary species involved in the nitrogen cycle and thus plays a key role in ecosystem processes, globally. It exists as nitrate salts and as nitric acid (HNO3) in both aerosols and the gas phase. It is formed from the NO3 radical/N2O5 or directly from the oxidation of NO2 and is lost by photolysis, OH oxidation, and deposition. In regions covered with snow/ice it has a significant impact on air quality, atmospheric oxidizing capacity, greenhouse gas concentrations, and paleoclimate/isotopic data. Snow/ice environments can, at seasonal maximum, comprise similar to 30% of Earth's surface area while 10% is covered with ice/snow found at the polar cryosphere. Nitrate makes up 75-100% of the nitrogen budget deposited from the atmosphere and measured at the Arctic and Antarctica. Its concentrations in Greenland ice have risen by a factor of 2-3, reflecting the long-ranged transport of increased anthropogenic NOx (NO + NO2) emissions.
   The polar cryosphere is an active medium for the movement of traces gases, such as nitrate, between the snowpack/sea-ice and overlying atmosphere. Field, laboratory, and modeling efforts have quantitatively shown that the exchange of trace species between the snowpack and the air above is governed by photochemistry in combination with air moving gases between these two matrices. Polar tropospheric chemistry and dynamics immensely impact processes governing chemical composition, isotopic signatures, oxidizing capacity, and thus regional climate. This study presents a comprehensive review of laboratory and modeling efforts - contextualized by field measurements - that have elucidated physicochemical processes governing nitrate photochemistry and its impact on the polar snowpack. Specifically, after an Introduction to nitrate photochemistry in ice, we discuss the: 1) initial Arctic field measurements that sparked interest in ice photolysis in the polar regions; 2) suite of follow-up field studies that catalyzed laboratory and snow-chamber investigations that gave deeper understanding of the effects of snow/ice - air trace gas exchange due to nitrate photochemistry; 3) complementary laboratory, snow-chamber investigations; and 4) a detailed review of recent nitrate ice photolysis laboratory experiments and the potential impact of utilizing laboratory and computational models to study the role of nitrate in the nitrogen cycle.

AB Relative humidity (RH) is one of the most important parameters in the study of fog-haze. This paper first estimates the contributions of the key quantities (temperature, water vapor, air pollutant) and their combinations to the relative change of RH, and then investigates the relationships of RH with the long-term variation of haze and fog days based on the meteorological data in the Yangtze River Delta over the period 1970-2010. The main conclusions are as follows. (1) Temperature is the foremost factor influencing RH, with the effect of specific humidity and direct contribution of air pollutant being second and third. (2) RH shows a prominent descending trend in the Yangtze River Delta, due to global warming and the 'analogous heat island effect' (AHIE). (3) Decreasing RH was responsible for the reduction of fog days. The AHIE can explain the phenomenon in which fog days in metropolises are less than in small cities. (4) Granger causality analysis of inter-annual variation further shows that increasing aerosol loading Ganger-causes the increasing haze days, rather than meteorological parameters such as RH. High RH would enhance hygroscopic growth of particle and then suppress the planet boundary layer height (PBLH) and lead to more haze days, lower PBLH further increases aerosols and RH, this positive feedback mechanism can be established under the condition of aerosol loading being relatively stable and beyond the threshold for haze formation. (5) If aerosol emissions maintain the status quo, climate cooling would result in serious fog-haze events occurring more frequently in Yangtze River Delta. The research provide a scientific basis for understanding the influence of meteorological factors on RH and the connection between the variation of long term fog-haze days and RH under the background of climate change.

AB Wind-blown dust is an important source of trace metals, nutrients, and biological material to montane ecosystems. Mountain ranges in northern Utah are located downwind of multiple dust sources including the Great Basin Desert and the Wasatch Front urban area, providing an opportunity to investigate regional-scale differences in dust deposition chemistry and bacterial composition. We sampled discrete dust layers from snowpack across multiple locations in the Wasatch and Uinta Mountains (Utah) and the Snake Range (Nevada) during spring 2014 and 2015. Dust chemistry was unique in each airshed, suggesting that spatial variability and local sources were more important than temporal variability for the sampling period. The central Wasatch dust contained the highest concentrations of playa-associated elements (U, Mg, Li, Ca, Sr, As) and anthropogenic elements (Sb, Cu, Pb, Se) compared with lowest concentrations of these elements in the northern Wasatch, which is further from playa and anthropogenic sources. Sequential extractions indicate that the majority of Ca, Sr, and Cd is potentially available for transport during snowmelt while other elements are relatively immobile. Central Wasatch dust was more reactive to acetic acid than northern Wasatch dust for most elements, including REE + Y. Sr isotopes (Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios) were also unique to each sampling area, with the most radiogenic values in the central Wasatch. Similar to dust chemistry, bacterial communities in dusty snow reflected geographically localized dust events. In the central Wasatch, 69% of bacterial species were unique, suggesting that the airshed received the most diverse dust inputs from a combination of playa and anthropogenic sources. Gram-positive Actinobacteria and Firmicutes were common in snow but specific bacterial families distinguished airsheds (e.g., Bacillaceae, Geodermatophilaceae, Nakamurellaceae). Our results demonstrate that evaluating dust chemistry and bacteria in snow on a regional scale may more clearly link dust sources to the entrainment of pollutants and seeding of bacteria species to montane systems.

AB Open burning of sugarcane (Saccharum officinarurn) has a large impact in regional atmospheric pollution and global climatic change. In this research, pollutant emissions from sugarcane residues burning were measured in order to determine the emission factors (EFs) of elemental carbon (EC), organic carbon (OC), 18 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), K, Na, Ca, Mg, NO3-, SO42-, NH4+, and Cl- contained in particulate matter (PM), as well as EFs of the gaseous pollutants, carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH4) and 37 volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Experiments were carried out in an open combustion chamber equipped with isokinetic sampling, following EPA 5 and modified EPA 201-A methods. Preliminary tests showed that continuous feeding of residues does not represent the open burning carried out in the field since flaming stage is sustained, thus batch feeding of residues was used to perform around 30 experiments. Gaseous pollutants EFs were 1618 +/- 108, 25.7 +/- 2.04 and 2.29 +/- 0.13 g kg(-1) for CO2, CO and CH4 respectively, while C-2 compounds have the highest EF of VOCs. PM10 and PM2.5 accounted for 55% and 36% of total PM mass, whereas carbonaceous species (EC and OC) accounted for 66% in PM2.5 and 58% in PM10 and total PM mass. Emission factors of EC varied from 0.34 to 0.37 g kg(-1), and EF of OC were 0.44, 0.67 and 1.2 g kg(-1) for PM2.5, PM10 and total PM, respectively. Highest EFs of determined elements and anions were K and Cl-, respectively. Heavy PAHs such as benzo[b]fluoranthene, bezo[k]fluranthene and benzo[a]pyrene presented the greatest EFs with 0.265 +/- 0.04, 0.264 +/- 0.08 and 0.254 +/- 0.015 mg kg(-1) respectively. Kruskal Wallis tests indicated that EFs had no significant differences among sugarcane varieties harvested in sites with different altitudes and climate, thus they can be applied for inventories estimations in world regions similar to Mexico, as well as in air quality forecasting models and climatic model allowing a better knowledge of air pollution and climatic change scenarios. The results of this research can be the base to design and establish public policies in order to regulate and eventually eliminate the practices of pre-harvest and post-harvest sugarcane burning.

AB Motivated by a need to evaluate the effectiveness of a campaign to alleviate the notorious air pollution in China's Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region, we outline a temporal statistical adjustment method which is demonstrated from several aspects on its ability to remove the meteorological confounding existed in the air quality data. The adjustment makes the adjusted average concentration temporally comparable, and hence can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the emission reduction strategies over time. By applying the method on four major pollutants from 73 air quality monitoring sites along with meteorological data, the adjusted averages indicate a substantial regional reduction from 2013 to 2016 in PM2.5 by 27% and SO2 by 51% benefited from the elimination of high energy consumption and high polluting equipments and a 20.7% decline of the coal consumption, while average NO2 levels had been static with a mere 4.5% decline. Our study also reveals a significant increase in the ground O-3 by 11.3%. These suggests that future air quality management plans in BTH have to be based on dual targets of PM2.5 and O-3.

AB While compliance with air quality standards is evaluated at individual monitoring stations, projections of future ambient air quality for global climate and emission scenarios often rely on coarse resolution models. We describe a statistical transfer approach that bridges the spatial gap between air quality projections, averaged over four broad U.S. regions, from a global chemistry-climate model and the local level (at specific U.S. CASTNet sites). Our site-level projections are intended as a line of evidence in planning for possible futures rather than the sole basis for policy decisions. We use a set of transient sensitivity simulations (2006-2100) from the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) chemistry-climate model CM3, designed to isolate the effects of changes in anthropogenic ozone (O-3) precursor emissions, climate warming, and global background CH4 on surface O-3. We find that surface maximum daily 8-h average (MDA8) O-3 increases despite constant precursor emissions in a warmer climate during summer, particularly in the low tail of the MDA8 O-3 distribution for the Northeastern U.S., while MDA8 O-3 decreases slightly throughout the distribution over the West and Southeast during summer and fall. Under scenarios in which non-methane O-3 precursors decline as climate warms (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5), summertime MDA8 O-3 decreases with NOx emissions, most strongly in the upper tail of the MDA8 O-3 distribution. In a scenario where global methane abundances roughly double over the 21st century (RCP8.5), winter and spring MDA8 O-3 increases, particularly in the lower tail and over the Western U.S. In this RCP8.5 scenario, the number of days when MDA8 O-3 exceeds 70 ppb declines in summer with NOx emissions, but increases in spring (and winter); by the end of the century, the majority of sites in the WE and NE show probabilistic return values of the annual 4th highest MDA8 O-3 concentration above 70 ppb (the current O-3 NAAQS level). Continued increases in global CH4 abundances can be thought of as a "methane penalty", offsetting benefits otherwise attainable by controlling non-CH4 O-3 precursors.

AB The aim of this study was to setup a field experiment that will collect suitable data for parameterizing the release of Ambrosia pollen. The study took place on the Pannonian plain during three flowering seasons: 2014, 2015 and 2016. The sampling of airborne pollen was performed using volumetric spore traps at 0.5 m and 5 m above the canopy level of a strong homogenous Ambrosia artemisiifolia L. field (10 m x 10 m) in three temporal resolutions: 1 h, 7.5 min and 1.07 min. This high temporal resolution revealed characteristics that were hitherto unknown. Pollen production per day was estimated to range from 6.38 billion to 770 billion pollen grains for the whole experimental field. Measurements of meteorological parameters included: temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation, precipitation, wind speed and wind direction. Weak correlations between pollen concentration and meteorological parameters were obtained, indicating nonlinear relationships among them. The distribution of pollen concentration with respect to meteorological parameters showed that high pollen concentrations coincide with temperature in the interval 20-24 degrees C, and that relative humidity of around 95% can delay or even switch off the emission, while the turbulent kinetic energy of a wind less than 0.1 m(2) s(-2) is sufficient for lifting the pollen into the air. The test of the new model for Ambrosia pollen emission processes showed a strong correlation between measured and modeled data when the estimated emission capacity for the field was in the range of 45-75 billion pollen grains per day.

AB The development and implementation of effective policies for controlling PM2,5 mass concentrations and protecting human health depend upon the identification and apportionment of its sources. In this study, the PM2.5 sources affecting 6 urban and 2 rural sites across New York State during the period 2005-2016 were determined. The extracted profiles were compared to identify state-wide common profiles. The source contributions provide detailed, long-term quantification of the emission sources across the state during the investigated period (2005-2016). Seven factors were common to all sites: secondary sulfate, secondary nitrate, spark-ignition emissions, diesel emissions, road dust, biomass burning, and pyrolyzed organic (OP) rich. The largest contributors were secondary sulfate, secondary nitrate, spark-ignition (gasoline), diesel, and OP-rich. Secondary sulfate concentrations ranged from 2.3 g m(-3) at Whiteface to 3.2 ng m(-3) at Buffalo and the Bronx. The highest secondary sulfate fractional contributions were found at the rural sites (similar to 46% of PM2.5 mass) also showed the highest OP-rich contributions (similar to 19%). Secondary nitrate showed the highest concentrations at the urban sites representing similar to 17% of PM2.5 mass (1.6 +/- 0.3 pg m(3) on average). Urban sites also showed the highest average spark-ignition concentrations (1.7 +/- 0.2 g m(-3), similar to 18%) and diesel emissions (1.0 +/- 0.2 g m(-3), similar to 10%). During this period, secondary sulfate concentrations declined likely related to the implementation of mitigation strategies for controlling SO2 emissions and the changing economics of electricity generation. Similarly, diesel and secondary nitrate showed decreases in concentrations likely associated with the introduction of emissions controls and improved quality fuels for heavy-duty diesel on-road trucks and buses. Spark-ignition concentrations showed an increase across the state during 2014-2016 associated with the increase of registered vehicles in New York State.

AB Background: Air pollution epidemiological studies increasingly rely on high-resolution exposure prediction models. However, to date, few models of this type exist for use in China.
   Objectives: We produced a national land-use regression model (LUR) to estimate monthly average PM2.5, PMio and NO2 from 2014 to 2016 in China.
   Methods: We developed a spatiotemporal semi-parametric model using generalized additive mixed models. A variety of predictor variables were included in model: time varying meteorological data, high resolution land cover data from Globaland30, satellite measures of aerosol optical depth, and Geographic Information System (GIS)-derived predictors. We assessed model performance with two cross-validation (CV) approaches, including hold-out CV, and 10-fold CV.
   Results: Over 22,000 monthly observations at 1382 monitoring locations were included to estimate the air pollution exposure. The time-varying spatial terms explained 87%, 71%, and 69% of variability with a hold-out cross-validated R-2 of 0.85, 0.62, and 0.62 for PM2.5, PM2.0 and NO2 models, respectively. Models show that meteorological variables, population density, elevation, distance to road, and land cover types were important predictors for air pollution exposure.
   Conclusions: we have developed a new nationwide model to estimate residence-level air pollution exposures, which can be used in studies of the chronic adverse effects of air pollution.

AB Based on the detailed data of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) with 102 components measured continuously from September 2016 to August 2017 in Wuhan, the pollution characteristics, source apportionment, chemical reactivity and contribution to O-3 formation were analysed. The results revealed that the annual average concentration of total VOCs (TVOCs) was 34.65 ppbv. Alkanes were the species with the largest concentration, which accounted for 45.88% of TVOCs, and propane, ethane and ethene were the most abundant components. Diagnostic ratios (toluene/benzene, typical VOC species/acetylene) showed that vehicle exhaust emissions had significant effects on VOCs. Eight major sources were identified by positive matrix factorization (PMF), which included vehicular exhaust (24.42%), industrial sources (16.43%), coal burning (14.18%), solvent usage in painting/coating (13.48%), liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) usage (12.57%), fuel evaporation (11.34%), biomass burning (5.11%) and biogenic sources (2.47%). In addition, industrial sources, vehicle exhaust and LPG usage were the main sources that significantly aggravated VOC pollution in Wuhan. Potential source contribution function (PSCF) results showed that local pollution sources were the main sources influencing VOC pollution in Wuhan. The results of Empirical Kinetic Modelling Approach (EKMA) showed that Wuhan belongs to a VOC limited area. Finally, the results of the OH radical loss rate (OH) and ozone formation potential (OFP) showed that alkenes were the species with the largest amount of chemical activity, in which the highest OH radical loss rate was 42.56%. Simultaneously, alkenes contributed the most to O-3 formation, which accounted for 48.34%. The results can provide references for local governments regarding control strategies of VOCs and O-3 pollution.

AB In-injection port thermal desorption (TD) was extended in determination of particulate phase nitrated-polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (N-PAHs) on filter samples coupled with a gas chromatography/negative ion chemical ionization-mass spectrometry (GC/NCI-MS). The experimental and analytical parameters were optimized with standard testing and ambient samples. Fourteen of the most abundant N-PAHs in ambient airs were included for their quantification. A desorption temperature of 280 degrees C for 10 min was sufficient to transfer entire target compounds from injection port to the analytical system. Good linearity (R-2 > 0.995) on the calibrations for each analyte was achieved. The limit of detections (LODs) ranged from 46.5 to 152.3 pg per filter sample, which were 4-66% better than solvent extraction (SE) approach. Method precision, repeatability and reproducibility, determined by replicate analyses of calibration standards and ambient samples, were less than 6% for target compounds. Validation of the method were conducted with two batches of a total of 30 ambient aerosol-loaded filters using our TD and the traditional SE approaches. Reasonably good agreement (R-2 = 0.98) by the two methods was demonstrated for most of N-PAHs, except for 9-nitrophenanthrene and 6-nitrobenzo(a)pyrene. The in-injection port TD can improve laboratory efficiency and reduce solvent-based costs for the measurement of NPAHs.

AB To better understand the interannual variation of winter haze pollution, this paper investigates winter circulation types and their impacts on local meteorological conditions and haze pollution during 38 winters from 1980 to 2017 in Beijing. Circulation types were classified by T-mode principal component analysis combined with the K-means cluster method using European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts ERA-interim sea level pressure data. The results can significantly distinguish the cold air process, a degeneration of cold air, and stagnant weather. The cold air process over Beijing was accompanied by a low temperature, high relative humidity, large pressure gradient and near-surface wind speed, and deep mixing layer. The cold air process facilitated pollutant dispersion and transport to the outside (such as East China, Bohai Sea, and Yellow Sea) and formed low PM2.5 concentrations and low frequencies of haze days. In contrast, the local meteorology and haze pollution were almost the inverse for stagnant weather. The local meteorological conditions and haze pollution for the degeneration of cold air are between the previous circulation types. Considering PM2.5 observation during 2010-2017, the occurrence frequency of cold air was low in the recent winters of 2013, 2014 and 2017, and resulted in severe PM2.5 pollution. High frequency of stagnant weather (48.4%) was one of the reasons that haze pollution reached 37% during 38 winters from 1980 to 2017 over Beijing. The time series of haze frequency was negatively correlated with that of cold air frequency. Winter haze pollution was affected by climate change over Beijing. During 38 winters from 1980 to 2017, a decreased trend of haze days was found, which was partly related to an increased trend of cold air frequency. However, the trends of haze days and cold air in Beijing were not significant based on regression analysis.

AB Fluctuations of ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations show clear yearly and weekly patterns, which has been revealed by previous studies. However, reliability of those studies may be affected by their small research areas, short observation periods, and/or the lack of using specialized statistical approaches for time series. The current study applies a recently developed time-series analysis procedure, Prophet, to investigate seasonality of daily PM2.5 concentrations over nine years (2007-2015) measured at 220 monitoring stations across the United States. Prophet is a new tool for producing high quality forecasts from time series data that have characteristics of multiple temporal patterns with either linear or non-linear growth/decline. Through decomposing each PM2.5 time series into three major components (i.e., trend, seasonality, and holidays), we observed periodically changing patterns of PM2.5 concentrations weekly and yearly consistent with previous findings. Specifically, relatively high PM2.5 concentrations tend to appear in the month of January and on Fridays, and PM2.5 concentrations on Sunday are generally lower than those on most other days of the week. However, we discovered that high PM2.5 concentrations are also likely to appear in July. Additionally, compared to Fridays in most studies, the highest PM2.5 concentrations are found to more likely occur on Saturdays, while the lowest concentrations are found on Monday as universally as on Sunday. Beyond understanding the seasonality of PM2.5 concentrations, this study revealed the potential use of Prophet, originally designed for business time series, for detecting periodicities of environmental phenomena.

AB A total of 26 alternative and legacy perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) were investigated in air collected above the Bohai and Yellow Seas during a research cruise between June 28 and July 15, 2016. Sigma PFAS concentrations ranged from 70 pg m(-3) to 430 pg m(-3) (mean 230 +/- 100 pg m(-3)). Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA, mean 120 +/- 80 pg m(-3)) and 8:2 fluorotelomer alcohol (8:2 FTOH, mean 34 +/- 46 pg m(-3)) were the predominating compounds of ionizable PFASs (i-PFASs) and neutral PFASs (n-PFASs), respectively. The contributions of C-4 and C-6 i-PFASs were higher than those of C-8 i-PFASs. Alternative substances, such as chlorinated 6:2 polyfluoroalkyl ether sulfonic acids (Cl-6:2 PFESA, mean 1.6 +/- 1.2 pg m(-3)) and diPAPs (mean 1.6 +/- 1.3 pg m(-3)), were only detected on the filter. The distribution coefficient of 10:2 FTOH was higher than 8:2 FTOH, which could be explained by the length of the carbon chain. The gas phase dry deposition velocities were simulated, and the values ranged from 0.08 +/- 0.12 cm s(-1) to 0.85 +/- 0.28 cm s(-1). For i-PFASs and diPAPs, the estimated fluxes of the particle phase were higher than those of the gas phase. For n-PFASs and TFA, the gas phase deposition played a key role. The Sigma PFASs dry deposition fluxes were 11-290 ng (m(2) d)(-1) (mean 72 +/- 67 ng (m(2) d)(-1)). The measurement of the concentrations in the gas and particle phases simultaneously provided a more comprehensive understanding of PFAS behaviours in air.

AB Henan province is one of the most critical emitters of ammonia (NH3) and is one of the most seriously air polluted regions in China. In this study, we developed a first comprehensive and novel 2015-based NH3 emission inventory for Henan province based on investigational activity data with corrected and updated emission factors of anthropogenic and natural sources. The 3km x 3 km gridded emissions and monthly variations were allocated by using appropriate spatial and localized temporal surrogates. The total NH3 emission was 1031.6 Gg in 2015, of which livestock, N fertilizer application, and humans were the top three contributors, accounting for 57.3%, 28.2%, and 3.1%, respectively. The cities of Nanyang, Zhoukou, and Zhumadian with more rural and agricultural activities were demonstrated to have relatively high emissions, accounting for 12.5%, 10.1%, and 9.7% of total emissions, respectively. The regional averaged emission density was 6.3 t km(-2), with higher values in eastern and northern Henan province. Obvious seasonal variability was observed, with the highest emission in July and the lowest in January associated with temperature and local farming activities. In addition, according to the emissions investigation carried out from 2006 to 2016, the largest changes occurred in non-agricultural sources. Furthermore, we quantitatively analyzed the estimated emissions with the uncertainty range of -33%-35% using the AuvToolPro tool. This emission inventory was also evaluated by comparing the magnitudes with other studies, analyzing the correlation of the observed ambient NH3 concentration with emission density and temperature, and investigating the trend of molar ratio of (2SO(2)+ NO2)/NH3. The emission inventory developed in this study can provide information to understand local emission characteristics, and to determine how to prioritize effective control strategies properly for policy makers.

AB Aerosol chemistry measurements were performed during the routine monitoring periods in the urban atmosphere of Gwangju, Korea. Routine aerosol monitoring was carried out every sixth day in order to investigate the dependence of domestic sources and air mass transport characteristics on physicochemical and optical properties of atmospheric aerosol. Aerosol optical properties; atmospheric extinction and scattering coefficients were also measured continuously with a transmissometer and a nephelometer, respectively in order to investigate the causes of visibility impairment. Prevailing atmospheric condition was classified into four categories; one affected by stagnant condition (D), one affected by continental and domestic aerosols (CD), one affected by marine and domestic aerosols (MD), and one affected by continental, marine and domestic aerosols (CMD). Atmospheric condition type was further classified into thirteen sub -categories with the occurrences of episodic events such as Asian dust storm, biomass burning, and airborne pollen. The air mass types of D, CD, MD, and CMD were observed to be 11, 18, 43, and 78 events out of total 150 events, respectively. The fine mass concentration increased under continental air mass types. The average fine mass concentration of 23.0 +/- 8.6 mu g m(-3) for CD type was slightly larger than that of 20.7 +/- 5.2 mu g m(-3) for CMD type. Both of them were higher than that for D (18.9 +/- 4.5 mu g m(-3)) type. Increments of the fine mass concentrations for Asian dust storm (A) and Biomass burning (B) events ranged from 141 to 151% and from 152 to 160% compared to those for D and CD types, respectively. The increments in the mass concentrations of nitrate, OC, EC, and BC for CD and CMD types in comparison with D air mass type were calculated to be approximately 17, 6, 8, and 22%, respectively. The mean mass extinction efficiency of PM10 was relatively higher in D (3.6 +/- 1.6 m(2) g(-1)) type and B events (4.1 +/- 1.5 m(2) g(-1)), but it was the lowest in MD air mass type. The aerosols observed in Gwangju were found to be influenced by the continental aerosol during the A events. Aerosol of CMD air mass type caused mainly poor visibility. The visibility reduction of Gwangju was influenced by the increase of carbonaceous particles under both domestically stagnant condition and air mass pathway from the continent. And ammonium sulfates and ammonium nitrates contributed the largest in CMD air mass type.

AB Lead (Pb) is a toxic metal whose global anthropogenic fluxes are an order of magnitude higher than natural fluxes. Among all the environmental compartments, the atmosphere is the major initial recipient of Pb. To minimize the exposure to this toxic metal, it is important to determine the potential sources of atmospheric Pb. This study uses a multiproxy approach, Pb isotopes in conjunction with metal composition of aerosols to determine the possible sources of anthropogenic Pb in the atmosphere, in and around an Indian megacity, Kolkata. In Asia, India is the second largest atmospheric Pb emitter after China through coal combustion. Indian automobile and high temperature metallurgy industries are growing rapidly and Pb emissions from India can be traced as far south as in Chagos Island in the Indian Ocean. This study investigates the anthropogenic sources of atmospheric Pb in eastern India at three locations along a 150 Km N-S stretch. The locations have very different environmental settings; a pristine river island, a megacity, and an industrial town. Pb isotope and metal compositions indicate different sources of atmospheric Pb for the three locations: gasoline exhaust from road and riverine traffic in the island, emissions from the high temperature metallurgy industry in the industrial town and long-range transport of coal combustion and industrial emissions for the megacity. The Pb isotope ratios ((206)pb/(207)pb 1.1155-1.1681 and (208)pb/(207)pb = 2.3905-2.4494) measured in this study have a wider range and are mostly higher than previously measured in Indian aerosols. Pb isotope compositions of two end members, Indian coal and road dust are also measured. This study shows that post leaded gasoline phase-out, the atmospheric Pb emissions in India are dominated by Indian coal combustion and ore processing.

AB Anthropogenic climate change has been increasingly confirmed by weather observation and scientific literature in recent decades. Atmospheric stability, which has strong effects on vertical mixing of air pollutants and thus air quality, may be affected under climate change. This study aims to statistically assess the impacts of climate change alone on the future air quality in the Pearl River Delta region in the near future (2030-2039) and the far future (2090-2099) under two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) scenarios, i.e., RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, based on the future surface and upper level meteorological data projected by one regional climate model (RCM): WRF, and by four general circulation models (GCMs): CanESM2, MIROC, MRI-CGCM3 and MPI-ESM-LR. The arithmetic means of projections reveal an increase in the levels of air pollutants [ozone (03), respirable suspended particulates (RSP) and sulphur dioxide (SO2)] in various seasons, even though a decrease is projected to occur in June-July-August. These changes in projected mean concentration are more significant in the far future, and under the RCP8.5 scenario. Among difference meteorological variables, surface temperature is most associated with the projected change in the three pollutants, with a range from 56.9% to 65.2% in all seasons and for all pollutants, relative to all contributions in RCP8.5 for example. Other notable associations include positive effects of vertical temperature gradient and the temperature dew point difference on pollutant concentration. We found an increase in frequency of high pollution levels in December-January February and March April May, as the occurrence proportion of pollutant concentration greater than the recent 95th percentile is 9.5%-9.6% and 6.4%-9.2%, respectively. We conclude that climate change alone is projected to have significant effect on air quality in the Pearl River Delta region in future, implying the necessity of more stringent air pollutant emission control policies to mitigate air pollution in the future.

AB Ground level 24 h average observations of Be-7 activity, combined with continuous ozone (O-3), carbon monoxide (CO) and minimum relative humidity (minRH) measurements, were conducted at two non-urban sites in the Deep South of the United States. One site is inland at Yorkville, Georgia, YRK (33 degrees 55 ' 27 '' N; 84 degrees 59 ' 44 '' W); the other is near the coast of the Gulf of Mexico outside Pensacola, Florida, OLF (30 degrees 25'N:87 degrees 13'W). The objective of the measurements was to explore the potential for estimating a contribution to surface O-3 from stratospheric and upper tropospheric air for during the springtime months from April 2 to June 13, 2015 using Be-7 as a tracer. The observed 24 h average Be-7 activities were 1.88 +/- 0.66 mBq/m(3) at YRK and 1.99 +/- 0.68 mBq/m(3) at OLF. Corresponding means of 24 h average O-3 mixing ratios were 38.3 +/- 10.1 ppbv for YRK and 28.7 +/- 8.9 ppbv at OLF. A weak statistically significant O-3-Be-7 regression based estimate of O-3 from the stratosphere and upper troposphere was constrained to a conservative upper bound of 14 +/- 4 (1 sigma) ppbv. From daily inspection of meteorological features, a lower bound of 3-7 ppbv was estimated. A multiple regression of 03 versus 7Be and daily minimum relative humidity (minRH) improved the statistical fit and indicated stratosphere-upper troposphere contributions of 8.6 +/- 4.0 ppbv for YRK and 6.6 +/- 3.3 ppbv for OLF. Daily variability of Be-7 and O-3 was explored with respect to meteorological variability. Be-7-O-3 relationships in this experiment were examined using (a) ozonesonde and vertical dew point temperature profiles, inferring very dry air as an upper atmosphere tracer descending into the boundary layer, (b) backward air trajectories, identifying Be-7 spatial and temporal variation, and (c) precipitation, indicating Be-7 scavenging and lowered O-3 with suppression of photochemistry. The average Be-7 measurements at the ground during the study are useful for helping estimate the long-term O-3 contributions from the upper atmosphere. However, the day-to-day TBe observations had limited value for determining the contributions of upper air O-3 to daily O-3 mixing ratios. Conventional surface and upper-air meteorological data could be used effectively as an alternative.

AB Biomass combustion technology is widely considered as an attractive option to remove carbon dioxide emissions and thus could become a viable option for next generation co-combustion power plants with coal. Among biomasses, the faster growing herbaceous biomass (Miscanthus) is relatively inexpensive as a solid fuel but has higher mineral contents (especially high levels of alkali metals) than that of a lignocellulosic biomass (Pitch pine) which leads to ultrafine particle emissions during combustion. This study proposes a dual stage treatment method to extract the inherent minerals in a herbaceous biomass prior to the combustion test. The method consists of an initial treatment with a basic (NaOH) solution and a sequential treatment with an acidic (CH3COOH) solution. To verify the proposed method, we investigated the variations in both the mineral contents and the PM, NOx and SO2 emissions between raw- and treated samples. The experimental results show that sodium, potassium and chloride in the treated herbaceous sample, which are the major minerals that generate ultrafine particles, were removed up to 96.3, 99.4 and 98.3%, respectively. The proposed method is more effective for herbaceous biomasses due to its higher Brunauer Emmett Teller (BET) value. Furthermore, the treated herbaceous biomass is even environmentally superior to raw lignocellulosic biomasses currently used in co-combustion power plants with coal in terms of the PM2.5, NOx and SO2 emissions, for which their rejection was measured as 60, 25 and 46%, respectively. These results will help to reduce the energy and costs for De-NOx (selective catalytic reduction, SCR system) and De-SO2 (scrubber) units.

AB The aim of this paper is to determine an accurate formulation for the sea-spray source function characteristic for the North-Western Mediterranean. To this end, the MACMod aerosol transport model was implemented in the study area using different sea-state dependent flux formulations. The simulations were compared to a large data set of aerosol size distributions acquired over the last ten years in the study area, yielding the evolution of the sea-spray concentrations with increasing fetch and hence, with the development of the wave field. This allowed for an improvement of the Demoisson et al. (2013) sea-spray source function (S3F) for the Mediterranean. The new formulation extends its validity to shorter fetch and larger radii and turned out to be most suitable for predicting the atmospheric concentrations of sea-spray aerosols in this region.

AB Cooking is an important source of air pollutants in Chinese residences. Cooking emissions are influenced by many factors, among which oil temperature is one of the most influential. In this study, 15 typical Chinese dishes, prepared using oil-based cooking methods (stir-, pan- and deep-frying), were chosen. The experiment was repeated three times with each dish-freshly prepared for each subsequent analysis-considering five key factors, to determine the emission rates of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), ultrafine particles (UFPs), formaldehyde, and total volatile organic compounds (TVOC). The oil temperature and oil consumption were measured. A partial correlation analysis was performed to identify the influence of oil temperature on air pollutant emission rates during Chinese residential cooking. The zero-order correlation coefficients for all air pollutants, excluding UFPs, and partial correlation coefficients for all air pollutants, were not significant, implying that the influence of oil temperature on air pollutant emission rates was not significant, because practical peak oil temperatures (112-177 degrees C) were mostly below the oil smoke point (107-234 degrees C).

AB The initial nucleation of ultrafine particle recently attracts more attention as a key factor in visibility degradation during early haze. In this study, we have performed Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculation to investigate the particle-induced initial nucleation process during early haze. Our calculation results show that the water molecules aggregate surrounding nuclei to form heterogeneous cluster under a certain RH, the synergistic effect of multiple-bonding interactions makes heterogeneous cluster incline to form and stably exist with lower total energy as well as approximately 3-10 times expansionary volume, the hygroscopic growth of aerosol particles would play an important role in affecting the atmospheric visibility. The electron cloud density transferring from the exterior H2O molecule to the interior nuclei in the cluster is characterized by migration effect or nonuniform distribution. The decreasing energy gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) in the heterogeneous cluster would lead to a red-shifted absorption wavelength lambda(max). It exerts the blue, indigo and violet visible-light absorption of corresponding wavelength for NO, NO2, NO3- and O-3 heterogeneous clusters to enhance light extinction, thus contributing to visibility degradation, during early haze periods. It helps to intensify the color-enhancing effect of visible light with longer wavelength, such as red, orange as well as yellow light, to promote the evolution of early haze in clean weather period. This study shows that one of the important mechanisms of atmospheric visibility degradation in haze event is the heterogeneous cluster formation in the size range of about 2-4 nm during initial nucleation stage. Our results highlight that prevention of gas-phase chemical species (NO, NO2 and SO2) emission, and also regulatory controls of the concentrations of NO3-, O-3 in atmosphere are necessary to prevent deterioration of the air quality in future.

AB Unexpected releases of hazardous airborne materials may happen in various circumstances, more frequently in accidental situations, less usually due to malicious activities. In all cases, the risk for the population and the rescue team is real and must be evaluated in order to take appropriate protection measures. Numerical models are more and more used in emergency response tools for predicting the atmospheric dispersion of pollutants and estimating impacted areas. Still, flow and dispersion modelling in a built-up environment may be very challenging given the complex geometry and meteorological conditions. Here, we present and evaluate a modelling approach that is a compromise between accuracy and timeliness of the computations. It is based on a 3D Lagrangian Particle Dispersion model driven by 3D flow and turbulence input provided by either a diagnostic mass-consistent model or a model solving the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes equations. This modelling system has been validated on a panel of experimental test cases from the Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) Action ES1006 in both idealized and realistic urban mock-ups, wind tunnel and field trials, continuous and puffs releases. The sensitivity of the model to the meteorological input data is assessed. The results are discussed comparing predicted concentrations to measurements. The performances of the modelling system are evaluated through a statistical analysis. They were found to depend on the type of test case, type of release and location of the source in the built-up domain. Results show that the model is compliant with the validation criteria, established in literature for the reference metrics, in the large majority of the test cases. The modelling system proved to be robust enough to be used in the context of emergency response, when fast but still reliable results are needed.

AB We comprehensively analyzed the temporo-spatial changes in the CO2 concentrations in Australia from June 2009 to December 2016 using greenhouse gas monitoring satellites, Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT) and Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2). Regarding the spatial distribution, the CO2 concentration in central Australia was always higher than that of other regions, and the lack of precipitation in this region is thought to be one of the main causes of this increased concentration. By combining the results with the Koppen-Geiger climate classification, a subtle relationship between the spatial distribution of CO2 and various climate types were found. Precipitation, Sea Surface Temperature (SST), phytoplankton around the coastal region, vegetation cover and other factors jointly affected the spatial CO2 concentration in Australia. Moreover, the results indicated that the abnormal SST in the 4 Nino zones would affect the precipitation and vegetation growth in Australia and the total chlorophyll in the equatorial Eastern Central Pacific Ocean, which would in turn influence carbon cycling in Australia. According to the Ni (n) over tildeo-3 and Ni (n) over tildeo-3.4 indices, two El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events occurred during the study period. The CO2 increase rate decreased during the period of the 2011 La Nina, while the CO2 increase rate increased during the period of the 2015 El Nino. With the global CO2 concentration as the background, the abnormal change of CO2 in Australia was analyzed. Lastly, the results showed that SST around Australia, precipitation, vegetation, ENSO events, oceanic chemical processes and bushfires were assumed to directly or indirectly influence the temporal changes in CO2 in this region.

AB Atmospheric gaseous elemental mercury (GEM) and meteorological parameters were simultaneously monitored at two building rooftops in downtown Toronto, Canada from Oct. 2015 to Oct. 2016. The two buildings are 136 m apart, one is an office building (60 m tall) and the other (30 m tall) mainly contains chemistry and biology laboratories, offices and classrooms. The average mercury concentrations were found to be 1.46 +/- 0.54 ng/m(3) and 1.78 0.89 ng/m(3) for the 60 m and 30 m sites, respectively. Analysis of the data reveals that sporadic events of high mercury concentration are related to local sources; that the higher level of GEM at the 30 m site resulted from a combination of local sources and weaker mixing of air at lower height; regional sources contributed to the loading of GEM in urban atmosphere.
   Comparing the data set with a data set collected in 2004 from the same location revealed that the average atmospheric GEM concentration in downtown Toronto dropped from 4.5 ng/m(3) to 1.78 ng/m(3) (60% decrease). Decreases in GEM were also observed in the data reported by CAMNet over the same period in rural and remote areas but to a lesser extent (10.5 and 13.9% respectively). The decrease is in line with the key national and provincial policies on mercury use, emission control and management that have been enacted since 2004.

AB Surface observations collected over the period 1980-2010 at three Continuous Ambient Monitoring Stations located in Houston, Texas were leveraged to create a long-term composite dataset of tropospheric ozone measurements. This dataset was used to evaluate large-scale influences and their relationship to exceedances of the 70 ppbv National Ambient Air Quality Standard for ozone. A linear regression fit to monthly mean daily peak 8-h concentrations for each month revealed a decreasing trend for the duration of the study period. After removal of this temporal trend, 8-h peak values averaged for each month featured peaks in springtime and late-summer with relative minima in mid-summer and winter. Stratification of the database by El Nino-Southern Oscillation phase using the Oceanic Ni (n) over tildeo Index revealed a statistically significant (alpha = 0.05) dependence of peak 8-h concentration on ENSO phase, with an enhancement of 5.8, 4.8, and 7.0 for March, April, and June during warm phase years, while cool phase years had statistically significant enhancements of 5.0, 4.0, and 3.6 ppbv in February, October, and December relative to neutral conditions. Importantly, relative to neutral conditions, "El Nino years" produce 26% more exceedences while "La Nina years" produce 23% fewer. The earlier onset of ozone seasons both in spring and late summer during El Nino years leads to more exposure to direct sunlight and more seasonal photochemical production, while the delayed late summer season during La Nina years leads to decreased sunlight and suppressed seasonal photochemical production relative to neutral years. Evaluation of the number of exceedances per month for each ENSO regime also suggests high tropospheric ozone concentrations in the fall and spring, with 4.4 and 6.8 exceedances per month in June and September, respectively for the warm phase. During cool phase conditions, Houston averaged 5.0 exceedances per month in September. Exceedances for neutral conditions ranged from zero exceedances in December to 2.2 exceedances in May and 5.0 in September. Analysis of exceedance data and mean values in light of parameters of the underlying distribution of daily peak 8-h data suggests that ENSO may influence the shape of those distributions, influencing both background ozone concentrations and the number of exceedances. Fast Fourier analysis indicated a common spectral signature for the ENSO and ozone spectra. This finding has implications for air quality mitigation strategies employed during warm phase and cool phase years.

AB Adjoint sensitivity analysis of NO., VOCs, and O-3 around the south-eastern part of the Korean Peninsula was performed to estimate their contribution to the high O-3 level in the inland city, Daegu. Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) and Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) modeling systems were used to simulate local circulation and a high O-3 episode day. The adjoint version of the CMAQ model was applied because it is efficient in making decisions for emission control. Areas affecting day time O-3 concentration in the receptors were investigated at various times. The results show that the transport of precursors (NOx, and VOCs) was more important than that of O-3 itself. The main influence area was extended from a neighboring location to eastern coastal city Pohang, affecting mainly on the same day as the receptor time. Another sensitive area was a remote area south of Daegu, where VOCs emitted on the previous day affected O-3 concentration at the receptor time in relation with sea-breeze penetration. Sensitivities differed between the lower and upper parts of the boundary layer because of its development during the transport of O-3 precursors. After the adjoint sensitivity analysis, the influences of meteorological and chemical effects was investigated separately without the chemical reaction module; the results were 61.9% and 38.1%, respectively. This adjoint result provides valuable information for decision making regarding emission control for air quality.

AB SAPRC16 is an interim update to the SAPRC series of chemical mechanisms that includes updated rate constants, a revised representation of radical chemistry, and a new speciation lumping scheme to better develop predictions of SOA precursors. In this study, the ability of the SAPRC16 chemical mechanism to simulate regional ozone episodes is tested in seven (7) major cities across the United States. The UCD-CIT 3-dimensional (3D) airshed model was configured with both SAPRC11 (base mechanism) and SAPRC16 (updated mechanism). Concentrations of ozone, hydroxyl radical (OH) and hydroperoxyl (HO2) radical predicted with both mechanisms were compared to measured values. It was generally observed that SAPRC16 predicts slightly lower ozone concentrations than SAPRC11 in NOx rich urban centers. A box model analysis shows that the SAPRC16 mechanism quenches ozone production earlier than SAPRC11 as NOx concentrations increase (yielding decreasing VOC/NOx ratios). This could be caused by more detailed HO2 + RO2 reactions and RO2 isomerization reactions in SAPRC16 that compete with the HO2+NO reaction. Predictions from SAPRC11 are in better agreement with the measurements in the western United States, however SAPRC16 outperforms SAPRC11 in some eastern and southern U.S. cities. These results may also be strongly influenced by the accuracy of emissions inventories in each region. Differences in ozone concentrations predicted by SAPRC16 and SAPRC11 increased as emissions decreased suggesting that the two mechanisms will predict different outcomes from future emissions control programs. In general, the SAPRC11 mechanisms slightly over-predicts OH concentration while under-predicting HO2 radical concentration and the SAPRC16 mechanism slightly under predicts OH and under predicts HO2, sometimes by large amounts. The reasons for this behavior are unknown at this time. These features will influence the secondary organic aerosol (SOA) predictions from each mechanism since the branching between high NOx and low NOx regimes depends on calculated HO2 concentrations. Further analysis of the HO2+RO2 reactions and RO2 isomerization reactions and the reasons for the lower HO2 predictions in the updated SAPRC16 chemical mechanism should be carried out before widespread adoption of the new mechanism.

AB It is generally conceived that trees can clean polluted air in urban areas sufficiently enough to be considered providers of a vital ecosystem service, although there have not been many field studies showing this in practice in the neighbourhood scale. Using passive sampling methods, we investigated the effect of urban park trees on the concentrations of gaseous polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ground-level ozone (O-3) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) in early summer in the temperate zone city of Yanji, northeast China. Concentrations of total gaseous PAHs and certain PAH constituents were higher and concentrations of O-3 lower in tree-covered areas compared to nearby open areas, while tree cover did not affect the concentrations of NO2 and SO2. The higher PAH concentrations under tree canopies may associate with air-soil gas exchange and the trapping of polluted air under canopies. Lower O-3 concentrations in tree-covered areas may result from a combination of absorption of O-3 by tree canopies, and lower temperatures and solar radiation under tree canopies compared to open areas.

AB River dust has severe impact on air quality in western Taiwan under prevailing strong northeasterly winds during passage of cold fronts. Data showed that river dust in western Taiwan from November to April came mainly from Choshui River (CS). The difference in mean seasonal concentration of river dust upstream of CS at station Erlin (EL) and downstream at station Lunbei (LB) could be as high as 14.2 mu g/m(3) during northeasterly monsoon from 1994 to 2015. A major river-dust event with unprecedented PM10 concentration occurring in western Taiwan on 2 November, 2009 was examined to understand further the mechanism behind its occurrence and impact on air quality. Weather conditions of 1-2 November, 2009 showed a clear pressure gradient in a strong baroclinic environment associated with a prevailing strong continental outflow (northeasterly, a >= 12 m/s) that lasted more than 30 h over the coastal area of China. On 2 November, 2009, the peak concentration of PM10 concentration was 600 mu g/m(3) at EL but exceeded 2500 mu g/m(3) at LB. While wind speeds of these two stations were comparable, the PN10 concentration at LB was more than four times that at EL due to dust blown up from CS riverbed. These findings could be reasonably captured by the WRF-Chem model. Simulation results also indicated that the depth of this strong northerly wind (> 10 m/s) was below 1000 m and its intensity increased significantly after 0 LST on 2 November, 2009. Strong wind did not favor vertical diffusion of river dust, thus trapping it below 200 m in height and causing severe dust concentration at near-surface level. Besides high wind speed, dry atmospheric and surface drought conditions also contributed to increase river dust suspension in the air. The results and methods obtained in this study can be applied to other regions of similar environment and with comparable relief.

AB Aerosols affect the Earth's radiation budget by interacting with the incoming solar radiation. The physicochemical properties, particularly morphological parameters (Aspect Ratio, AR and Circulatory Factor, CIR) and composition at individual particle level are important inputs to the optical model for assessing the optical sensitivity towards said properties. The observation of these properties is limited over Antarctica which has been studied in detail in the present work.
   The PM5 particles (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 5 mu m) over Antarctica were collected at Indian Antarctic station, Maitri (70.77 degrees S, 11.73 degrees E) from Dec 2013-Feb 2014. The individual particle analysis revealed that particles were mainly composed of Si, Fe, Al, Ca and Mg. Most of the particles were observed in layered, flattened, aggregated and glass-like shapes. The frequency distributions of the morphological parameters, AR and CIR were observed to be bimodal with respective mode peaks 1.3 and 1.9 for AR; 0.4 and 0.7 for CIR. The spectral refractive indices of individual particles were estimated. The imaginary part of the refractive indices was observed to be maximum for chromium (Cr) and iron (Fe) rich particle and nearly negligible for aluminum (Al) rich particle. At 0.58 mu m wavelength, the difference in SSA with respect to Al rich particle was found to be maximum for Ca rich particles (i.e. 43%) followed with Cr and Fe rich particle (i.e. 42.08%) and Cr rich particle (i.e. 39.32%).

AB The deterioration of the air quality is a global concern. Daily PM10 samples were simultaneously collected and chemically characterized at an urban and a rural site in Cienfuegos, Cuba between January 2015 and January 2016. A source apportionment study was conducted in order to identify and quantify the main contributions of both local and long-range sources.
   Concentrations of PM10 varied similarly at the urban and rural site, with annual averages of 35.4 and 24.8 mu g rn(-3), respectively. The highest concentrations were observed between March and August at both sites, when a strong influence of Saharan dust was identified. The PM10 daily limit (50 mu g m(-3)) established in the Cuban legislation for air quality was exceeded by 3 and 8 times in the rural and urban site, respectively. The chemical characterization of PM10 showed important contributions of mineral matter, total carbon and secondary inorganic compounds in the region, with the highest concentrations observed at the urban site. Marine contribution, by contrast, was higher at the rural site. The highest EFs were obtained for the typical road traffic tracers Mo and Cu. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis coupled with conditional bivariate probability function (CBPF) and concentration weighted trajectory (CWT) identified 5 main sources in the studied sites: Saharan intrusions, marine aerosol, combustion sources and secondary aerosols, road traffic and cement plant. The Saharan dust contribution was quantified for the first time in Cuba, proving to be one of the major components of PM10 at both sites. Its daily contribution, indeed, explained more than 60% of the PM10 recorded in 10 of the 11 exceedance events.
   This study reports the first simultaneous evaluation of PM10 and its chemical composition in urban and rural areas of Cuba, and provides the basis for environmental managers to adopt control strategies to reduce the impact of PM10 pollution in the region.

AB Multi-AXis-Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) measurements were performed to remote sensing the aerosol vertical profiles in suburb area of Shanghai, China from April to December 2017. The retrieval of aerosol extinction was based on the optimal estimation method combing the measured oxygen dimer O-4 absorption with simulation of forward radiative transfer model. It suggests that the employment of O-4 correction factor (CFO4) for daily aerosol retrieval should be adjusted, which includes three typical cases that a fixed CFO4, no usage of CFO4 and different CFO4 in the morning and afternoon. In cases of using CFO4, elevation angle dependent CFO4(cc) were further proposed. Moreover, the retrieval results can be improved if the local sounding data of atmospheric temperature and pressure profiles were introduced into the forward radiative transfer model without utilizing additional CFO4. Afterwards, the retrieved Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and the surface Aerosol Extinction Coefficient (AEC) was in a good agreement with the AOD obtained from sun photometer observations and in-suit PM2.5 concentrations, with a correlation coefficient R of 0.866 and 0.833, respectively. Besides, the vertical AEC profiles retrieved by MAX-DOAS were also validated well by the co-located lidar measurement. It can be found that the particles were mainly distributed below 1 km, and the maximum AEC usually appeared in the lowest 300 m and decreased with the altitudes. The averaged AEC within 1 km varied from 0.20 to 0.75 km(-1), 0.25 to 1.08 km(-1), 0.55 to 2.45 km(-1) and 0.70 to 2.75 km(-1) under different air quality of Grade II, III, IV and V. The sounding meteorological parameters and backward trajectories of air masses were integrated to diagnose the influencing factor of AEC at different altitudes, which illustrated that the AEC levels at lowest layer were impacted by the long distance transportation of air pollutants from north-northwest and regional local air pollution nearby during the winter time. The study shows that ground-based MAX-DOAS observation is powerful remote sensing technique to provide better understanding of aerosol properties at both ground surface and higher altitudes.

AB Isoprene emissions from six tropical trees were evaluated by "Ping-Pong" method that iteratively optimized the temperature (C-T) and light (C-L) parameters of the Guenther model, G-93. Six tropical trees; Bauhinia variegate (camel's foot tree), Calophyllum inophyllum (ball tree), Garcinia subelliptica (fukugi tree), Syzygiurn cumini (black plum), Syzygium samarangense (wax jambu), and Mangifera indica (mango; red and yellow fruit) were exposed to LED light in a phytotron. Saplings of Populus nigra were similarly treated under the same experimental conditions for reference. The irradiance protocol consisted of 26 steps and two cycles of increase and decrease in light intensity. Plants were exposed to a wide variation in light intensity (200-1500 mu mol/m(2)/s), which resulted in leaf temperature variation of 29-40 degrees C. Predictions of isoprene emission by the optimized G-93 well captured the light and temperature dependent increase and decrease of isoprene emission rate in all tropical trees assessed. Comparatively, G-93 with default parameters showed lower efficacy in predicting emission rates during the ascending phase in the initial round, and at the peak phase in the second round of the irradiation scheme. G-93 with default parameters overestimated emissions at the initial ascending phase and underestimated at the second peak phase. Calculated Q(10) values for isoprene emission from tropical trees were much higher than that of the temperate plant P. nigra under same observational conditions. These results strongly imply that isoprene emission behavior of tropical plants deviate from that of temperate plant.

TI Dense gas dispersion model development and testing for the Jack Rabbit
   II phase 1 chlorine release experiments

AB In 2015 and 2016, the US Army conducted a series of large-scale chlorine releases at the Dugway Proving Ground in Utah, known as the Jack Rabbit II trials. The purpose of these experiments was to improve our understanding of pressure-liquefied chlorine releases and atmospheric dispersion, and provide useful practical knowledge for emergency responders. The tests conducted in 2015 featured a grid of Conex shipping containers around the release point to simulate a mock urban array of buildings, while the tests in 2016 studied different release orientations and culminated in the full discharge of a 20-ton chlorine road tanker.
   Before, during and after these experiments, a group of dispersion modelling experts from around the world collaborated in simulating the tests to help configure the experiments and evaluate the performance of models. This paper presents the progress made in that modelling activity by two of the groups involved: the UK Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and the US National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). The models tested by HSE and NCAR range in complexity from integral models that can be run quickly for emergency response to Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models that require days of computing time. This paper summarizes these groups' analysis of the 2015 experimental data and initial model findings, and outlines future research directions.
   The discharge model predictions by HSE show that meta-stable models tended to over-predict the measured release rate from the chlorine tank, whilst flashing models under-predicted the release rate. CFD simulations of the near-field flow behavior show that the chlorine cloud was initially directed laterally, out of the sides of the mock urban array, due to the alignment of Conex containers. The two integral models tested by HSE (DRIFT and PHAST) provide best agreement with the downwind concentration data when they take into account the rainout of liquid from the impinging two-phase jet. The two models tend to over-predict concentrations slightly, but many of the measurements may have under-recorded the peak concentrations, due to sensors saturating and the clouds bypassing sensors. The newly-developed NCAR integral model accounts for the transition from momentum to buoyancy-dominated behavior and shows promising agreement with the CFD results and measured concentrations. In addition, it reproduces the observed -5/3 power law decay in concentration at large distances.
   Efforts are continuing on analysis of the Jack Rabbit II experiments and a collaborative international model inter-comparison exercise is currently underway. Additional papers by the coordinators of that exercise and other experts should be forthcoming. The Jack Rabbit II dataset will no doubt be used for decades to come as a seminal test case for validating flashing jet and dense gas dispersion models.

AB A total of 59 current-use pesticides were monitored in ambient air samples collected from February 2012 to December 2017, at two rural and six urban sites in Provence-Alpes-Cote-d'Azur Region and Corsica, France. 45 of searched active substances were detected at least in one sample, at frequencies ranging from 0.1 to 98.6%. Among the most frequently detected pesticides, we found the herbicide Pendimethalin (64.6%), the fungicide Tebuconazole (65.9%), and the insecticides Chlorpyrifos (71.5%) and Lindane (98.6%). A wide range of atmospheric concentrations was measured from few pg m(-3) to several hundreds of ng m(-3), with a maximum concentration of 407.79 ng m(-3) for Chlorpyrifos (Cavaillon, May 2012). 17 active substances exceeded an atmospheric concentration of 1 ng m(-3) for at least one sample, including Folpet (147 times/162 detections), Chlorpyrifos (56/520), and Pendimethalin (29/464). The spatial distribution shows that pesticides were detected both in the eight rural and urban sampling sites, suggesting an atmospheric transport from agricultural areas to cities. Classifying the 8 sampling sites according to samples composition, two types of site were observed, those (Aleria, Arles, Avignon, Port-de-Bouc, and Toulon) where a majority of fungicides are found and those (Cannes, Cavaillon, and Nice) where insecticides are dominant. Long-term (6 years) monitoring shows a seasonally trend for each pesticide, depending on pest pressure. Inter-annual variation suggests a downward trend which is consistent with the regional sales data.

AB The quality of emission inventories substantially bases on the reliability of used emission factors (EFs). In this work EFs were studied according to recently published characterization methods, called "beReal", reflecting real life operating conditions in Europe. EFs for four pellet stoves and nine firewood appliances (roomheaters and cookers) of carbon monoxide (CO), organic gaseous compounds (OGC), nitrogen oxides, total solid particles (TSP) of hot and of diluted flue gas, total, elemental and organic carbon (TC, EC, OC) and benzo(a)pyrene were determined.
   CO, OGC, TSPs, TC, EC and OC emissions from firewood appliances were significantly higher than for pellet stoves, indicating the high relevance of classifying appliances according to the operation type. TSP sampled from diluted flue gas at 40 degrees C (28 mg MJ(-1) to 271 mg MJ(-1) based on fuel input) was higher than TSP sampled from hot flue gas (21 mg MJ(-1) to 70 mg MJ(-1)). This reveals the high relevance of sampling conditions for the determination of real life emissions. Benzo(a)pyrene emissions scattered over a wide range (0.5 mu g MJ(-1) to 129.8 mu g MJ(-1)) indicating high sensitivity to unfavorable combustion conditions. Therefore a higher number of experimentally determined emissions factors could improve the reliability of EFs for inventories. CO emissions measured in beReal tests were substantially higher than official type tests, thus showing that type testing results provide limited information for the determination of real life emissions.
   A systematic evaluation of EFs with defined real life methods like beReal would substantially improve the reliability of emission inventories.

AB Household air pollution is one important environmental risk to human health in China, however, rural air pollution is often underappreciated and field measurements are limited compared to studies in urban area. The present study investigated indoor and outdoor polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and population inhalation exposure from two rural counties in Shanxi and Guizhou provinces, respectively. The indoor levels were higher than the corresponding outdoor concentration in both sites, which was mainly affected by the indoor fuel combustion emissions. A majority of particulate PAHs was found in submicron PM1.0. Fuel types had significant impacts on the total PAHs mass concentration but also composition profiles. In homes using electricity, the PAHs concentration was lower than those burning solid fuels, and there were relatively more fractions of low molecular weight PAHs with 2-3 rings, while for those burning solid fuels, higher fractions of high molecular weight PAHs with 5-6 rings may pose larger adverse health impacts. Although the daily inhalation exposure level for the population using electricity was much lower than those using solid fuels, the estimated Incremental Lifetime Cancer Risk still exceeded the deemed safe risk of 10(-6). Inhalation exposure amounts measured by using portable carried samplers were compared to the estimation based on area concentration. The substantial discrepancy between them confirmed a preferable use of portable carried samplers in exposure evaluation and health risk assessment.

AB Total and size-resolved concentrations and emission factors are used to compare fleet-averaged vehicle emissions in Pittsburgh, PA in 2002 and 2014. Winter-time traffic tunnel measurements acquired using dual scanning mobility particle sizers (SMPS) over the size range 3-500 nm form the key input for the analysis. Size-resolved mass emission factors were calculated assuming a nanoparticle aggregate model. The ultrafine particle (< 30 nm) emissions of diesel vehicles significantly dropped from 2002 to 2014. In the 2014 study, a thermodenuder (TD) was deployed together with the SMPS to measure emissions of non-volatile particles. After evaporation at 250 degrees C inside the TD, the median diameter of the number-size distribution shifted from 16 nm to similar to 7 nm. The total particle number decreased significantly (69%) after evaporating inside the TD, indicating that vehicle emitted particles may be largely externally mixed and that a large fraction of these particles may be purely composed of volatile components. Based on the SMPS-TD measurements, we report a size-resolved volatile-to-non-volatile-component-ratio for vehicle emitted particles. It shows that smaller particles (10-60 nm) emitted by vehicles are dominantly (over 75%) composed of volatile components. We also apportioned the size resolved particles and non-volatile particle mass and number emission factors for both gasoline and diesel vehicles. Diesel vehicles emitted significantly more ultrafine particles and non-volatile particles than gasoline vehicles.

AB The atmospheric deposition of water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) contributes to the open ocean dissolved organic carbon (DOC) reservoir similarly to riverine discharge. However, information on the sources and composition of water-soluble organic matter (WSOM) in marine aerosols remains scarce, particularly at the molecular level. By using ultra-high resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS), we identified approximately ten thousand molecular formulas in marine aerosols collected over the China coastal seas and the northwestern Pacific Ocean (NWPO). Even though their molecular compositions were highly variable (Bray-Curtis distance: 0.12-0.74), four distinctive origins, namely, marine biogenic sources, secondary organic aerosols (including CHO, CHON formulas derived from biogenic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and organosulfate derived from both biogenic and anthropogenic VOCs), soil-derived organic matter (OM) and biomass and fossil fuel burning-derived polycyclic aromatics (including highly condensed organosulfur compounds) and unsaturated compounds, were discovered. Moreover, the different types of aerosols, including aerosols from the NWPO (marine-influenced), NWPO (dust) and China coastal seas, contained various proportions of organics from different sources. The NWPO (marine-influenced) aerosols were enriched with sea spray-derived OM, which was widely distributed and was likely related to marine biological activity. The NWPO (dust) aerosols exhibited a higher fraction of soil-derived OM, while the China coastal sea aerosols exhibited a much higher fraction of organosulfate than the other aerosols. Our investigation provided detailed molecular compositional and source information for marine aerosols over the northwestern Pacific Ocean, which can be utilized to understand the composition of WSOM deposited on the sea surface.

AB Pyruvic acid (PA) exists in fogs, aerosols and clouds. The photochemistry-driven reaction pathways of PA in the aqueous phase are more elusive than the gas phase. The PA photochemical process may occur in the bulk liquid phase and at the air-liquid interface in ambient conditions. We conducted two sample preparation methods to simulate two possible scenarios: the air-liquid interface and the bulk liquid phase under photolysis. Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometer (ToF-SIMS) was used to analyze samples because of its high sensitivity and mass accuracy in surface analysis. Both negative and positive ion mode mass spectra provide complementary information of the products under different reaction conditions. Spectral principal component analysis (PCA) is used to determine similarities and differences among various samples. The air-liquid interface facilitates more radical reactions and form higher molecular weight compounds (HMWCs) more quickly than the bulk liquid phase, which mainly has non-radical reactions such as anhydride reactions and decarboxylation reactions. Our results show that interfacial chemistry plays an important role in atmospheric scenarios. Moreover, different types of secondary organic aerosols (SOAs) are formed, suggesting the strong influence of interfacial photochemistry has on the earth atmosphere.

AB Soil fugitive dust (SFD) contributes significantly to ambient particulate matter (PM) in Northern China. In this study, an improved method is developed to establish a high spatial resolution SFD emission inventory through the use of remote sensing (RS)-geographical information system (GIS) technology based on the wind erosion equation (WEQ). The purpose of the application of RS is to obtain vegetation coverage data, which can be achieved through the supervised classification of land use and retrieval of vegetation coverage. Vegetation coverage was then converted to vegetative cover factor by adopting the approach given in this study. Given that the excellent spatial data analysis and the calculation function of the GIS, the high-spatial-resolution vegetative cover factor, soil texture, control efficiency, and other parameters could be multilayer nested and calculated. The SFD emission inventory is eventually obtained, with the highest spatial resolution of 30 m. As an application case, the SFD emission inventory of Tianjin city in 2013 was established with an activity level of 6383 sq. km. bare land, and 27.14 kt, 14.39 kt, 6.240 kt emitted TSP, PM10, PM2.5, respectively. Moreover, the Calpuff model was used to simulate the contributions of SFD to ambient springtime PM10 and compare the predicted PM10 to observation data to explore the feasibility of this method. This study could be a reference for the establishment of a high spatial resolution SFD emission inventory in dust dominated regions, providing information that will meet the requirement of air quality models and support the efforts of government to reduce particulate matter pollution.

AB PM2.5 (particulate matter) samples from ship emissions were collected using the portable dilution tunnel sampler in a Chinese port city. A fishing boat, three navigation processes (departing, cruising and arriving) of a roll-on/roll-off (ro-ro) passenger ship and a freighter vessel were tested for seven source profiles during on-board sampling campaigns. The chemical composition properties of profiles were obtained based on carbonaceous material (organic carbon and element carbon), elements and water-soluble ions (NH4+, NO3- and SO42-). Unique characteristic of each source profile was evaluated by COD and RMSD values. The results showed that PM2.5 from ships shared similar signatures in which OC (30.4%-46.1%), EC (6.6%-24.0%) and SO42- (1.1%-5.9%) comprised a large amount. Heavy metals such as Ni and V can be regarded as trace markers for heavy fuel oil burning in the ship emissions. COD and RMSD values between each pair of profiles revealed differences of source profiles. The fishing boat (FH) source had prominent differences from the rest source profiles, besides, the freighter sources were similar with the ferry main engine (FME) source. For navigation processes, it was found that arriving process can be clearly distinguished from the other two processes. Analyses of relative non-cancer and cancer risks of PM-bound heavy metals indicated that Cr heavily contributed to both non-cancer risk and cancer risk of heavy metals (above 75%) for fishing boats and freighters. The Cr, Co and Ni played important roles in risk of FME. The relative risk influences of Co increased and those of Cr decreased from departure to arrival of FME. Besides, the As showed more serious cancer risk in FAE and FMEA.

AB North China Plain (NCP) is one of heavily polluted regions that is characterized by a mixture of a myriad of anthropogenic and natural aerosols. A substantial spatial and temporal variations of aerosols and their compositions there poses a good testbed for the validation of model simulations. Aerosol optical depth (AOD) and PM2.5 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter < 2.5 mu m) concentration products from the Modern Era Retrospective-Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2) are evaluated using available independent ground-based in situ and remote sensing products in the NCP. The comparison of MERRA-2 aerosol species to the observations is also performed. Although several satellite and ground-based AOD products are assimilated into the MERRA-2, MERRA-2 AOD is systematically smaller than independent sunphotometer measurements. The biases range from 0.09 (13%) in the summer to 0.17 (33%) in the spring and show little spatial dependence. Daytime AOD variations are captured by the MERRA-2, although MERRA-2 has relatively lower AOD. MERRA-2 produces lower PM2.5 concentration relative to surface measurements in all seasons except in summer. The largest bias is found in the winter (44 mu gm(-3)). On the contrary, summer MERRA-2 PM2.5 is close to surface-measured PM2.5 (with bias of 0.4 mu gm(-3) MERRA-2 was unable to reproduce diurnal PM2.5 variation. Evaluation of MERRA-2 aerosol species in the winter of 2014 suggests that MERRA-2 could not keep track of dramatic day-to-day variation of aerosols and their species. Potential causes for this deficiency may include a lack of nitrate aerosols (accounting for 20% of PM2.5 concentrations during heavily polluted days). This fault cannot be remedied by assimilation of satellite AODs because they are often missing.

AB Long-term particulate matter (PM) mass concentration measurements have been performed in Cyprus at three major cities, one industrial area and two remote stations covering the entire southern part of the island in an effort to assess; i) the spatial and temporal variability of sub-10 mu m (PM10), fine (PM2.5) and submicron (PM1) particulate matter in the eastern Mediterranean, ii) the main source areas contributing to their levels and iii) the relative contribution of regional and local anthropogenic and natural sources to PM levels. It was found that dust is responsible for the 33.6 +/- 5.2% or about 10 mu g m(-3) of the annual PM10, levels reported in background stations; the latter underlines the significant contribution of natural sources on the ambient PM10 amounts in the eastern Mediterranean region. A significant (p < 0.001) decreasing trend of 0.7 +/- 0.1 mu g m(-3)y(-1) was observed when both PM10 and PM2.5 annual values are considered, indicating contribution from both natural and anthropogenic sources to this tendency. By considering the PMx (with x = 1, 2.5 and 10) mass concentrations obtained at the background station of Agia Marina as representative of the regional influence, the local influence of the urban and industrial sites on the measured PMx levels can be estimated. On average, 36-44% of the observed PM10 levels at the urban and industrial locations is estimated to originate from local anthropogenic and/or natural emissions including vehicle, biomass-burning, shipping emissions (in Limassol), airport related emissions (in Larnaca), resuspension of dust and sea-salt (in coastal locations). These local emissions are almost equally distributed in the fine and coarse fractions as 40-50% of the local PM10 amounts are due to fine particles emissions. The above results highlight significant emissions from both fine mode (e.g. residential heating and traffic) and coarse mode urban emissions (e.g. dust resuspension, wear and tear in brakes and tires, respectively) in urban and industrial locations in Cyprus.

AB The formation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) from isoprene ozonolysis was investigated using a FEP Teflon reactor with and without the presence of H2O, CO, SO2 and UV-light irradiation (365 nm) to reveal their possible influence on SOA formation. Compared with the base experiment (isoprene + O-3) under dark condition, the presence of 2000 ppm H2O and 1000 ppm CO could remarkably suppress SOA formation from isoprene ozonolysis, with SOA yields reduced from 2.96% to 1.47% and 2.08%, respectively. The evident reduction of SOA yields from isoprene ozonolysis with the presence of H2O and CO was mainly ascribed to the suppression of Stable Criegee Intermediates (SCIs). In contrast, the particle yield from isoprene ozonolysis with the presence of SO2 pronouncedly increased from 2.96% to 57.9%, suggesting that the oxidation of SO2 by SCIs made great contribution to the particle formation. The SOA or particle yields from all the reaction systems with and without presence of H2O, CO and SO2 reduced more than 27% under the UV-light irradiation with respect to dark condition, which were mainly attributed to the SCIs photolysis. The contribution of OH channel to SOA formation from isoprene ozonolysis was estimated to be less than 30%. Considering the 50% reduction of SOA yield from isoprene ozonolysis under light irradiation, the disappearance of the component with low O:C and H:C and high molecule weight in the SOA sample collected under light irradiation indicated the polymerization of unsaturated SCIs might be an important SOA formation channel besides the oligomerization of SCIs, HCHO, and MACR from isoprene ozonolysis under dark condition.

AB High altitude shows a great influence on vehicle emissions because of lower pressure and shortage of oxygen concentrations. In addition, type approval test of light duty vehicle is usually carried out below the elevation of 1000 m. In order to address the effect of high altitude on vehicle emissions, real driving emission (RDE) test procedure has been introduced in China VI emission regulation. Thus, the effects of altitude on the emissions from a China IV certificated light-duty diesel vehicle under real road driving conditions were investigated in this work. Research results show that CO emissions increased with the elevated altitude. At the altitude of 2990 m, the CO emissions increased by 209% in comparison with that of near sea level in whole test cycle. At specific test modes, CO emissions follow the sequence of urban > rural > motorway. Both PN and NOx emissions also rose with altitude while NOx emissions at 2990 m showed a decreasing tendency. In addition, different tendency between high altitudes and relative low altitudes was observed under specific test modes, which was probably related to the function of after-treatment device.

AB With the rapid growth of economy and urbanization rate, haze pollution is becoming more and more serious in China, and it is harmful to human health and China's sustainable development. For exploring spatiotemporal variations of PM10 pollution problem from 1992 to 2012 in China, we first proved that there existed a positive correlation between the intercalibrated Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) Operational Linescan System (OLS) sensor nighttime stable light (NSL) data and PM10 emissions in this study. Then linear regression analysis was utilized to model spatiotemporal PM10 emission variations in China by the intercalibrated DMSP-OLS NSL data. PM10 emissions at prefectural level were selected as validation data for verifying the accuracy of spatiotemporal PM10 emissions variations and the results demonstrated that the DMSP-OLS NSL data can simulate PM10 emissions at 1 km resolution well. At last, spatiotemporal PM10 emission dynamics were analyzed from national scale down to regional and urban agglomeration scales. The results clearly noticed that the variations of PM10 emissions in different regions and urban agglomerations were different. The high-growth type of PM10 emissions was mainly located in the Eastern region, Central region, Western region, Shandong Peninsula, Wuhan Metropolitan Area and Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan, with significant lower concentrations in the Northeastern region, Middle south of Liaoning and Pearl River Delta. The high grade of PM10 emissions was mainly distributed in the Eastern region, Central region and Shandong Peninsula, with significant lower concentrations in the Western region, Northeastern region, Sichuan-Chongqing. Considering the difference of temporal and spatial variations of PM10 emissions in the four regions, the mitigation strategy in the Eastern and Central China should mainly focus on the adjustment of industrial structure, while in Western and Northern China, we should pay attention to the improvement and optimization of regional energy structure and energy efficiency.

AB Moisture plays a crucial role in the heterogeneous formation of sulfur compounds on mineral dust particles. The heterogeneous uptake of SO2 under various humidity conditions, however, is not well explained. In this study, heterogeneous reaction of SO2 on hematite particles are investigated using an in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS). The interaction of SO2 with H2O is divided into the initial moisture absorption stage and the subsequent heterogeneous oxidation stage, indicating physical adsorption and chemical conversion of SO2, respectively. Uptake coefficients were estimated by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area and geometric surface area. For unreacted (fresh) particles, the coefficients peak at 33% RH and then decline with increasing RH in both stages, implying the competition between SO2 and large amount of adsorbed H2O besides the promoting effect of water. For hematite after in-situ exposure to SO2 (sulfated particles), the coefficients increase as a function of RH in moisture absorption stage, indicating SO2 adsorption with particle hygroscopic growth. Nevertheless, the coefficients exhibit similar variation with that for fresh particles in heterogeneous oxidation stage, highlighting the competition effect after H2O accumulation. Generally, H2O plays both positive and negative roles in the adsorption of SO2. Reaction on sulfated hematite is significantly influenced by previously formed sulfate compounds with low hygroscopicity. Moreover, sulfate products may influence particle acidity after H2O introduction, and further result in diverse existence forms of S(IV) species. The extremely great uptake capacity of sulfated particles in moisture absorption stage may offer opportunities to explain the severe haze in high RH.

AB The expansion of soil salinization area has become a great challenge for the reduction of greenhouse gases in fragile ecological environments. A high saline-alkaline soil sample, S-1, with electrical conductivity (EC) of 2.60 dS m(-1), and a low saline-alkaline soil sample, S-2, with EC of 0.74 dS m(-1), from the Hetao Irrigation District of Inner Mongolia were studied using the static opaque chamber method in a field in situ observation test that lasted 3 y (2014-2016). The 3-y study was conducted with sunflower crops in intensively managed saline -alkaline soil cropping systems in Northwest China to examine the effects of salt and alkali on Global Warming Potential (GWP) after accounting for carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent emissions from methane (CH4) uptake and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. Results indicated that high saline-alkaline soil significantly increased Global Warming Potential, with obvious differences in CH4 uptake and N2O emissions as compared to low saline -alkaline soil. The annual cumulative uptake of CH4 for 2014, 2015, and 2016 was estimated at 150.0 mg m(-2), 119.6 mg m(-2), and 99.9 mg m(-2), respectively, for the low saline-alkaline soil. Compared with the low saline-alkaline soil, the high saline-alkaline soil significantly decreased the cumulative uptake of CH4 by 27%, 28%, and 19% for 2014, 2015, and 2016, respectively. The annual cumulative emissions of N2O for 2014, 2015, and 2016 were estimated at 180.6 mg m(-2), 167.6 mg m(-2), and 118.2 mg m(-2), respectively, for the low saline-alkaline soil. Compared with the low saline-alkaline soil, the high saline-alkaline soil significantly increased the cumulative emissions of N2O by 19%, 26%, and 45% for 2014, 2015, and 2016, respectively. Overall, compared with the low saline-alkaline soil, the high saline-alkaline soil significantly increased GWP from CH4 uptake and N2O emissions by 20%, 30%, and 50% in 2014, 2015, and 2016, respectively. Our findings suggest that mitigating the GWP of saline-alkaline soil can be achieved by remediating the soil.

AB The burning of tropical rainforests in the Southeast Asia emits considerable particulate matter (PM), which has significant effects on air quality and human health. Lacking of reliable local EFPM for rainforest burning in the Southeast Asia is one of the most important causes for uncertainty of the estimated pollutant emissions. In this study, 23 types of rainforest plants, including herbaceous, shrubs, evergreen trees and deciduous trees were burned to determine emission factors of PM and multiple chemical species, including organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC), water soluble ions (WSIs), and elements using a custom-made dilution system. EFPM for the four vegetation types was relatively higher for burning of deciduous trees, followed by evergreen trees, shrubs and herbaceous. EFPM in the Southeast Asia was higher than those in the North America, South America and Africa, with biomass type and ambient temperature and humidity as the determinant factors. Organic matter was the dominant constituent of PM, accounting for 57%, followed by EC, WSIs and elements. Source profile of WSIs varied larger than those of OC, EC and elements for different biomass type and areas. For example, the fraction of K+, a typical biomass burning tracer, to WSIs was 30% and 28% in the Southeast Asia and North America, respectively, which was almost 2 times lower than those in the Europe. Finally, the temporal and spatial scales of PM, OC, and EC emissions from rainforest burning in the Southeast Asia in 2016 were estimated, based on the updated measured EFs. The annual emissions (minimum-maximum) were 1527-2834 Gg, 529.9-1100 Gg, and 81.02-150.4 Gg for PM, OC and EC, respectively. Our results suggest that using of EFPM reported in other regions would lead to an underestimation of PM emissions in the Southeast Asia.

AB The deterioration of urban air quality is considered worldwide one of the primary environmental issues and scientific evidence associates the exposure to ambient air pollution with serious health effects. This fact highlights the importance of generating accurate fields of air pollution for quantifying present and future health related risks. Interpolation methods for point estimations in the field of air pollution modelling enable the estimation of pollutant concentrations in unmonitored locations. The main objective of this study is to evaluate two interpolation methodologies, Artificial Neural Networks and Multiple Linear Regression, using data from a real urban air quality monitoring network located at the greater area of metropolitan Athens in Greece. The results for five regulated air pollutants (Nitrogen dioxide, Nitrogen monoxide, Ozone, Carbon monoxide and Sulphur dioxide) are compared through the use of a set of correlation and difference statistical measures and residuals distribution. Artificial neural networks are found in most cases to be significantly superior, especially where the air quality network density is limited, leading to a decreased degree of spatial correlations among the monitoring sites.

AB In recent years, ground-level O-3 and its potential risks on agricultural crops have attracted worldwide attention from both society and academic community. According to the hourly O-3 concentration data in 24 cities of the Yangtze River Delta during wheat (16 March to 29 May 2015) and rice (20 July to 20 October 2015) growing seasons, we estimated the yield and economic losses of wheat and rice resulted by O-3 exposure using O-3 exposure-response functions based on AOT40 (accumulated hourly O-3 concentration above 40 ppb, this exposure index is the current standard for vegetation protection against O-3). The results showed that the O-3 mean concentration during wheat and rice growing seasons ranged from 28.2 to 44.3 ppb and 27.6-44.2 ppb, respectively. The AOT40 values during wheat and rice growing seasons ranged from 4.33 to 15.82 ppm h and 7.64-25.15 ppm h, respectively. Relative yield loss ranged from 9.86 to 36.05% for wheat and 7.25-23.87% for rice. The total crop production loss for wheat and rice amounted to 552.55 x 10(4) tons and 535.06 x 10(4) tons, respectively. The total economic loss amounted to 209.31 x 10(7) US$ for wheat and 237.03 x 10(7) US$ for rice. Our study revealed the potential regional risk of ground-level O-3 exposure to crops in the Yangtze River Delta. Therefore, some effective measures should be taken urgently to reduce the negative effects of O-3 on crop productivity.

AB The real-world exhaust emissions and fuel consumption of on-road diesel vehicles, fueled by waste cooking oil biodiesel blends, were measured using a portable emission measurement system (PEMS). Two light-duty diesel trucks (LDDTs) and two heavy-duty diesel trucks (HDDTs) filled with four mixed fuels with blend ratios of 0% (neat diesel), 5% (B5), 20% (B20), and 100% (B100) (biodiesel in traditional fossil diesel) were tested. The results show that the total fuel consumption (biodiesel + traditional fossil diesel) did not clearly decrease, but blending biodiesel into traditional fossil diesel could clearly decreased the consumption of traditional fossil diesel, reduce the countries' dependence on oil imports. Converting waste cooking oil into biofuel and blending with diesel is a three-win alternative, dealing simultaneously with greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, food security, and energy security. The CO, HC, NOx and PM2.5 emissions for all of the tested vehicles decreased with increasing biodiesel content in the blend, with the exception of PM2.5 and NOx for D3, the NOx emissions showed a decrease with increasing biodiesel content in the blend for most vehicles in this study. The effect of emission reduction for all biodiesel blending proportions under highway (HW) condition is better than that under Non highway (NHW) condition. The degree of reduction in CO, HC, NOx, and PM2.5 emission increased with increasing biodiesel content in the blend under HW section. Under the NHW section, the emission factors for lower biodiesel blend proportions (below 12.5%) especially for B5 were higher than those for neat diesel. The biodiesel blend reduced CO, HC, NOx and PM2.5 emissions compared with neat diesel under different driving modes except for individual condition (especially for B5 under acceleration mode). Increasing the biodiesel content of the blend lowered the CO, HC, NOx, and PM2.5 emissions for acceleration and deceleration modes.

AB To investigate chemical characteristics and sources of humic-like substances (HULIS) in the background region of Southwest China, daily PM2.5 samples were collected on Weizhou Island from 14 March 2015 to 14 April 2015. Water soluble inorganic ions, organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC), water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC), HULIS, oxalate, levoglucosan and mannosan were analyzed. Average concentration of PM2.5 was 32.5 +/- 12.6 mu g/m(3) with SO42-, OC and NH4+ as the three most abundant components. Average concentration of HUMS was 5.00 +/- 2.21 mu g/m(3) with daily values ranged from 1.46 to 10.36 mu g/m(3). The carbon content of HULIS (HULIS-C) contributed 35.6% +/- 7.2% of OC and 76.8% +/- 12.9% of WSOC, indicating HULIS-C as one of the most important species in OC and WSOC in this region. The concentration of HULIS correlated well with those of non-sea salt (nss)K+, levoglucosan, oxalate, OC, EC, WSOC, SOC and WSOC/OC, suggesting dominant source factors from both biomass burning and secondary aerosol formation. Contributions from crust and sea salt source factors to HULIS were minimal as indicated by its poor correlation with nss-Ca2+, Mg2+ and Na2+. Research flight observations showed increasing biomass-burning indicators with increasing altitude, likely due to aerosols produced from biomass burning in Southeast Asia, which were then uplifted by deep convection to the middle troposphere and transported to this area. This hypothesis was supported by negative correlations between HULIS and sea level pressure when high-altitude air masses were transported from the Southeast Asian. Air mass backward trajectory analysis suggested Southeast Asian as the dominant source region for HULIS on Weizhou Island.

AB Simultaneous measurements of the water-soluble organic nitrogen (WSON) in the aerosols and rainwater were conducted to clarify the deposition pathway of the atmospheric WSON. In the aerosols, about 10% of the water-soluble total nitrogen (WSTN) was in an organic form, and a large portion (about 81% on average) of the WSON was distributed in the fine-mode range. Concentrations of the fine-mode WSON were associated with the acidity of the fine particles, suggesting the secondary production of the WSON in the acid fine particles. On the other hand, it was suggested that the coarse-mode WSON was derived from bio-particles, such as plant debris, although its concentrations were low and widely scattered. Dry deposition amounts of the WSON estimated from the concentrations and dry deposition velocities of the particulate WSON suggested that almost all of the dry deposition of the particulate WSON was derived from the coarse-mode particles. The contribution of the fine mode particles to the dry deposition was negligible. About 10% of the WSTN in the bulk precipitation was in an organic form. The bulk deposition amounts of the WSON were largely dependent on the rainfall amounts and coarse-mode WSON concentrations. Although about 30% of the WSON in the bulk deposition was from the dry deposition, the wet deposition significantly contributed to the WSON deposition, especially in the rainy season. Wet deposition is the major removal process of WSON from spring to autumn; however, in winter, dry and wet deposition are comparable.

AB Model of aerosols and cloud formation processes requires extensive data on hygroscopic properties of water soluble organic species at lower troposphere relevant temperatures, which are ubiquitously found in atmospheric aerosols. Recent field studies (Kerminen et al., 1998) have revealed that sea salt aerosols can be efficiently chemically processed by water soluble carboxylic acids and lead to chloride depletion and formation of carboxylic acid salts. In this study, we report hygroscopic properties of four carboxylic acid salts, namely, sodium formate, sodium acetate, sodium oxalate and sodium succinate at temperatures commonly encountered in the lower troposphere ranging from 295.8 K to 270.0 K for the first time via attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR). Deliquescence relative humidity (DRH) and efflorescence relative humidity (ERH) of these carboxylic salts as a function of temperature were derived using both changes in water-to-solute (WSR) data and changes in band positions and shapes of carboxylate asymmetric and symmetric stretch modes. Hygroscopic data were also fitted by polynomial and corresponding coefficients were obtained. Our results have shown that these carboxylic acid salts exhibit strong temperature dependence and they would deliquesce at a lower humidity and are more likely to remain deliquesced when they are elevated in the troposphere. Since all these carboxylic acid salts present very different hygroscopic behaviors at lower temperatures from that of NaCl, chemically processed sea salt aerosols by carboxylic acids are expected to have fairly different phase state, size, and water content, consequently affecting their reactivity, lifetime, and ability to serve as cloud condensation nuclei.

AB Ambient air pollution is considered as one of the greatest environmental risk factors to public health due to its correlation with the onset of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Beijing, the capital of China, is one of the most severely haze-polluted metropolis in the world; the entire city faces air pollution-related heath risks on a frequent basis. The goal of this study is to evaluate the short-term effect of ambient air pollution on emergency room (ER) admissions for respiratory disesases in Beijing, China. We used a generalized additive model to study a total of 274,627 ER admission cases for respiratory diseases from 2009 to 2012. We analyzed the correlations between three major ambient air pollutants (including PM10, SO2, and NO2) and the ER admissions for different age and gender subgroups. The results showed that: a) the effects of PM10 and SO2 are stronger in males than in females and in the elders (age >= 65years) than younger people; b) the effect of NO2 is stronger in children (age <= 15years) than older people; c) for per 10 mu g/m(3) increase in ambient PM10, SO2, and NO2 concentration, the greatest increase persentage (IP) of ER admissions was 2.8% (95% CI: 2.3-3.4%), 3.6% (95% CI: 1.4-5.8%), and 7.7% (95% CI:7.0-8.4%), respectively; d) increases in the three major ambient air pollutant concentrations affected ER admissions for respiratory diseases the most at lag 0-1 day. In particular, the elderly and females were relatively more sensitive to the three outdoor air pollutants, and were affected right away after the air pollutant concentration went up.

AB Wildland fires are a major source of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), one of the most harmful ambient pollutants for human health globally. To represent the influence of wildland fire emissions on atmospheric composition, regional and global chemical transport models rely on emission inventories developed from estimates of burned area (i.e. fire size and location). While different methods of estimating annual burned area agree reasonably well in the western U.S. (within 20-30% for most years during 2002-2014), estimates for the southern U.S. can vary by more than a factor of five. These differences in burned area lead to significant variability in the spatial and temporal allocation of emissions across fire emission inventory platforms. In this work, we implement wildland fire emission estimates for 2011 from three different products - the USEPA National Emission Inventory (NEI), the Fire Inventory of NCAR (FINN), and the Global Fire Emission Database (GFED4s) - into the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model to quantify and characterize differences in simulated PM and ozone concentrations across the contiguous U.S. (CONUS) due to the fire emission inventory used. The NEI is developed specifically for the U.S., while both FINN and GFED4s are available globally. We find that NEI emissions lead to the largest increases in modeled annual average PM2.5 (0.85 mu g m(-3)) and April-September maximum daily 8-h ozone (0.28 ppb) nationally compared to a "no fire" baseline, followed by FINN (0.33 mu g m(-3) and 0.22 ppb) and GFED4s (0.12 mu g m(-3) and 0.17 ppb). Annual mean enhancements in wildland fire pollution are highest in the southern U.S. across all three inventories (over 4 mu g m(-3) and 2 ppb in some areas), but show considerable spatial variability within these regions. We also examine the representation of five individual fire events during 2011 and find that of the two global inventories, FINN reproduces more of the acute changes in pollutant concentrations modeled with NEI and shown in surface observations during each of the episodes investigated compared to GFED4s. Understanding the sensitivity of modeling fire-related PM2.5 and ozone in the U.S. to burned area estimation approaches will inform future efforts to assess the implications of present and future fire activity for air quality and human health at national and global scales.

AB In response to severe haze pollution, the Chinese State Council set PM2.5 improvement targets for the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region in 2013. To achieve the targets for the residential sector, semi-coke briquettes are being considered as a replacement for traditional raw coals with the help of financial subsidy, but information on the emission from them and the impacts on the air quality is limited. Laboratory experiments were conducted to determine emission factors (EFs) for a typical semi-coke briquette, its parent material (bituminous raw-coal chunk) and three types of traditional coals (bituminous raw-coal-chunk, anthracite raw-coal-chunk and anthracite coal-briquette) extensively used in BTH. Compared with the parent material, significant lower EFs of primary PM2.5, organic carbon (OC), element carbon (EC), the sum of 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon components (PAHs), SO42-, NO3-, hazardous trace elements (HTEs) and NOx were found in semi-coke briquette. A scenario for the BTH region in 2015 in which raw coals were replaced with the semi-coke briquette showed that amounts of pollutants emitted from residential coal combustion could decrease by 91.6% for primary PM2.5, 94.0% for OC, 99.6% for EC, 99.9% for PAHs, 94.2% for NO3-, 45.6% for HTEs, 70.9% for NOx and 22.3% for SO2. However, SO42- loadings evidently would increase if raw coals were replaced with either semi coke briquette or anthracite coal-briquette. Geographic distributions of modeled reductions were developed to identify emission-reducing hot-spots and aid in the development of clean energy policies. Replacement of traditional raw coals with the semi-coke briquette apparently could lead to significant environmental improvements in BTH and other regions in China.

AB Ambient atmospheric acrolein is commonly associated with anthropogenic combustion sources, but there is increasing evidence that acrolein has a non-combustion natural source that contributes to a low, natural background of acrolein in remote regions. The objective of this research was to determine the presence of acrolein in a probable natural source, namely decaying leaf litter in forests. The first phase of this project surveyed leaf litter under five conifer and eight broadleaf tree species to determine whether acrolein could volatilize from the biomass that was present. Acrolein was detected in all species, but the concentrations were higher in recently dropped biomass. The second phase of the project measured the changes in acrolein concentration during the decomposition of fresh foliar biomass. The results showed a dramatic decline in acrolein and other aldehydes during the first two weeks of composting. The last phase of the project directly extracted fresh leaves and demonstrated that the fresh foliar biomass had high concentrations of acrolein even when there was no opportunity for microbial degradation. Taken together, these results suggest that the plants were primarily responsible for the production of acrolein which then subsequently volatilized or decayed when the foliar biomass was dropped from the tree. This research demonstrated that acrolein can be produced by plants, which provides a source of acrolein that can contribute to the natural background of acrolein in remote areas. In many cases, this natural background exceeds the EPA's reference concentration for acrolein.

AB A three-year sampling campaign (Jan 2011-Jan 2014) was conducted on organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) using high-volume air sampling nearby the Chinese Great Wall Station, west Antarctica. The concentrations of Sigma(23)OCPs ranged between 5.87 and 27.9 pg m(-3) (mean 14.3 +/- 5.4 pg m(-3)), and no temporal trend was observed over the entire sampling period. However, the dominant compound, hexachlorobezene (HCB) (71% on average of Sigma(23)OCPs), exhibited a seasonal variation with higher levels in the austral winter. Gas-particle partitioning of OCPs was explored based on K-OA absorption model, steady-state model and Junge-Pankow adsorption model. LogK(p) showed significantly negative correlations with logP(L)(0) of OCPs (p < 0.01, the slope is -0.30) and TSP values in the samples (p < 0.01), suggesting absorption by the organic matter as the dominant sorption process and TSP as an important factor influencing gas-particle partitioning of OCPs in this remote environment. The chiral signature indicated a commonly nonracemic residue of alpha-HCH and o,p'-DDT in the Antarctic air. The deviation from racemic (DFR) of o,p'-DDT showed a strongly negative dependence on its concentration (p < 0.01), properly suggesting more fresh input of o,p'-DDT after 2011. Preferential depletion of (+) alpha-HCH was observed mainly in gas phase, indicating the influence of re-volatilization of chiral compounds from source areas and/or ocean on their enantiomeric composition in remote air. Source apportionment demonstrated that long range atmospheric transport (LRAT) was the main transport pathway of OCPs, while nonracemic residues of HCHs and DDTs indicated a contribution of secondary source emission, i.e. seawater-air exchange, to their occurrence in west Antarctica.

AB A multi-scale correlation analysis method is introduced and a combined analysis of multi-scale correlations between air quality and meteorology in Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GHMGBA) of China is performed using 3-yr daily series of particulate matter (PM) fractions and O-3 observations and collocated meteorological reanalysis data during 2015-2017. PM and O-3 have significant seasonal oscillation and oscillations of 2-3 days, 5-7 days, quasi two weeks, and 20-30 days, which are typical periods in east-west wind (U), north south wind (V), wind speed (WS), temperature (T), relative humidity (RH), 925-hPa specific humidity (Q), and surface air pressure (SP), although different types of meteorological parameters have different significant periods. In GHMGBA, the East Asian Monsoon has different significant impacts on PM and O-3. The relationships of air quality with meteorology on higher frequency modes are usually very different from those on lower frequency modes since different mechanisms make effects. Correlation details may also differ on different synoptic scales. Especially, PM has consistent significant negative correlations with V, T, RH, and Q on seasonal oscillation but has large positive (negative) correlations with V, T, and Q (WS and SP) on oscillations of 2-3 days, 5-7 days, and quasi two weeks in winter half year. The latter synoptic correlations reflect the impact of the typical quasi-stationary front and cold front activities on PM, which usually includes two sequential asymmetric processes: a long no-precipitation stagnation period when ventilation, dilution, and hygroscopic growth make effects; and a short precipitation period when ventilation, dilution, and wet deposition make effects. In a word, local synoptic scales correlations cannot be directly extended to estimate the response of air quality to climate change projections.

Concentrations of TC and TN varied from 1.4 to 80 mu gC m(-3) (mean: 33.8 +/- 21.7 mu gC m(-3)) and 0.7 to 8.6 mu gN m(-3) (3.0 +/- 1.6 mu gN m(-3)), respectively. Temporal variations of TC and TN largely increased from the start of the campaign to March 21 and decreased during March 22-28 and then slightly increased during the period of March 28-April 13. This temporal pattern was consistent with variations of levoglucosan (LG, specific tracer of biomass burning) and MODIS (moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer)-derived fire spots in SEA, suggesting that BB emissions are major sources of PM2.5 aerosols at DAK. This inference was further supported by higher TC/TN ratios (range: 6-19, mean: 12.7 +/- 3.3) and significantly strong positive correlations among TC, TN, and LG during the campaign period. On the other hand, stable isotope ratios of total carbon (delta C-13(TC)) and nitrogen (delta(15)NrN) in PM2.5 ranged during the sampling period from -23.8 to -29.8%o (- 26.0 +/- 1.2 parts per thousand) and from +15.8 to +25.1 parts per thousand (19.4 +/- 2.1 parts per thousand), respectively. The estimated contribution from the burning of C-3 plants to TC ranged between 60 and 96% (average, 74 +/- 7%) in SEA, indicating the predominance of BB from forest fires. Interestingly, lower delta C-13(TC) values were associated with higher contribution of C-3 plants, suggesting that primary aerosols derived from the burning of C-3 plants caused a depletion of C-13(TC), whereas photochemical aging of organic aerosols may have enhanced delta C-13(TC), particularly in the second half of the campaign. In addition, changes in meteorological conditions and MODIS fire events may also have caused the changes in delta C-13(TC) during the campaign period. The delta C-13(TC) values reported in this study represent the typical BB aerosols. Our findings improve the fundamental understanding of the sources and transformation processes of atmospheric aerosols in SEA and its outflow regions.

AB With the enforcement of emissions standards and fuel-economy standards in Mainland China, it is both important and interesting to see how these recent emissions reduction strategies affected the spatiotemporal patterns of emissions over the period 2011-2015, which have rarely been examined in previous studies. This study aimed to fill this gap by estimating and analyzing vehicle emissions patterns to support the development of emissions reduction strategies. We established emissions inventories for Mainland China and individual provinces using statistical data from official yearbooks. The aggregated results showed that emissions of greenhouse gas increased slowly and emissions of pollutants decreased sharply. The individual results showed that there was an imbalance in the distribution of emissions, with high total emissions and emissions per inhabitant in developed provinces and high emissions per unit GDP in developing provinces. Specifically, light passenger cars and heavy-duty trucks contributed more than 50% of emissions, and their emissions were statistically spatially auto-correlated, which might hint that there were inherent spatial clustering patterns among emissions. Thereafter, a self-organizing map was used to cluster individual provinces, and indicated that a few provinces can be clustered together according to the similarity of their emissions patterns. Finally, we found that the influences of socioeconomic factors on emissions varied across space, where emissions in northeastern provinces were more likely to be affected by population and those in southwestern provinces tended to be influenced by GDP. These findings are believed to be useful for the development of emissions reduction strategies for sustainable development.

AB As part of the Observations and Modeling of the Green Ocean Amazon (GoAmazon 2014/5) Experiment, detailed aerosol and trace gas measurements were conducted near Manaus, a metropolis located in the central Amazon Basin. Measurements of aerosol particles and trace gases were done downwind Manaus at the sites T2 (Tiwa Hotel) and T3 (Manacapuru), at a distance of 8 and 70 km from Manaus, respectively. Based on in-plume measurements closer to Manaus (site T2), the chemical signatures of city emissions were used to improve the interpretation of pollutant levels at the T3 site. We derived chemical and physical properties for the city's atmospheric emission ensemble, taking into account only air masses impacted by the Manaus plume at both sites, during the wet and dry season Intensive Operating Periods (IOPs). At T2, average concentrations of aerosol number (CN), CO and SO2 were 5500 cm(-3) (between 10 and 490 nm), 145 ppb and 0.60 ppb, respectively, with a typical ratio ACN/ACO of 60-130 particles cm(-3) ppb(-1). The aerosol scattering (at RH < 60%) and absorption at 637 nm at T2 ranged from 10 to 50 M m(-1) and 5-10 M m(-1), respectively, leading to a mean single scattering albedo (SSA) of 0.70. In addition to identifying periods dominated by Manaus emissions at both T2 and T3, the plume transport between the two sampling sites was studied using back trajectory calculations. Results show that the presence of the Manaus plume at site T3 was important mainly during the daytime and at the end of the afternoons. During time periods directly impacted by Manaus emissions, an average aerosol number concentration of 3200 cm(-3) was measured at T3. Analysis of plume evolution between T2 and T3 indicates a transport time of 4-5 h. Changes of submicron organic and sulfate aerosols ratios relative to CO (Delta OA/Delta CO and Delta SO4/Delta CO, respectively) indicate significant production of secondary organic aerosol (SOA), corresponding to a 40% mass increase in OA and a 30% in SO4 mass concentration. Similarly, during air mass arrival at T3 the SSA increased to 0.83 from 0.70 at T2, mainly associated with an increase in organic aerosol concentration. Aerosol particle size distributions show a strong decrease in the Aitken nuclei mode (10-100 nm) during the transport from T2 to T3, in particular above 30 nm, as a result of efficient coagulation processes into larger particles. A decrease of 30% in the particle number concentration and an increase of about 50 nm in geometric mean diameter were observed from T2 to T3 sites. The study of the evolution of aerosol properties downwind of the city of Manaus improves our understanding of how coupling of anthropogenic and biogenic sources may be impacting the sensitive Amazonian atmosphere.

AB The importance of taking the organic forms of nitrogen (ON) into account when estimating atmospheric nitrogen deposition has been known for a long time. However, there is still only a modest amount of data on organic nitrogen in rainwater worldwide, largely due to the difficulties and uncertainties imposed by the available analytical methods. This work offers a simple, low cost, and reliable method for the determination of ON in rainwater, based on the photo-Fenton process under UV irradiation. The recovery of ON was determined using individual solutions of urea, serine, glycine, and histidine, as well as a mixture of all these compounds plus arginine. Close to 100% organic nitrogen recoveries were obtained for solutions containing 50 mol N L-1, using addition of 50 molL(-1) Fe2+ and 2.0 mmol L-1 H2O2, with adjustment of the pH to similar to 2.5 and irradiation for 90 min. The average reagent blank was < 2.0 mol N L-1. The homemade reactor employed a 400 W high pressure mercury lamp, from which the external bulb had been manually removed. The reactor ventilation was controlled in order to maintain the temperature at - 85 degrees C. The precision of the method ranged from 1.3 to 5.7%, based on ON recovery. Rainwater collected on an event basis in Ribeirao Preto (Sao Paulo State, Brazil) presented ON concentrations from 4.1 to 34.3 nmol L-1 (n = 18), corresponding to 13-45% of the total nitrogen, with an average contribution of 33%. Precision of s <= 7.0% was obtained for the analysis of ON in rainwater.

AB Numerical weather prediction (NWP) of urban aerosols is increasingly sophisticated and accurate. In the absence of large particles (e.g. rain, cloud droplets), information on atmospheric aerosols can be obtained from single wavelength automatic lidars and ceilometers (ALC) that measure profiles of attenuated backscatter (beta(o)). To assess the suitability of ALC profile observations for forecast evaluation and data assimilation, a forward operator is required to convert model variables into the measured quantity. Here, an aerosol forward operator (aerFO) is developed and tested with Met Office NWP data (UKV 1.5 km) to obtain synthetic attenuated back scatter profiles (beta(m)). aerFO requires as input the profiles of bulk aerosol mass mixing ratio and relative humidity to compute beta(m), plus air temperature and pressure to calculate the effect of water vapour absorption. Bulk aerosol characteristics (e.g. mean radius and number concentration) are used to estimate optical properties. ALC profile observations in London are used to assess beta(m). A wavelength-dependent extinction enhancement factor accounts for the change in optical properties due to aerosol swelling. Sensitivity studies show the aerFO unattenuated backscatter is very sensitive to the aerosol mass and relative humidity above similar to 60-80%. The extinction efficiency is sensitive to the choice of aerosol constituents and to ALC wavelength. Given aerosol is a tracer for boundary layer dynamics, application of the aerFO has proven very useful to evaluate the performance of urban surface parameterisation schemes and their ability to drive growth of the mixing layer. Implications of changing the urban surface scheme within the UKV is explored using two spring cases. For the original scheme, morning beta(m) is too high probably because of delayed vertical mixing. The new scheme reduced this persistence of high morning beta(m), demonstrating the importance of surface heating processes. Analysis of profiles at five sites on 12 clear-sky days shows a positive, statistically significant relation between the differences of modelled and measured near-surface attenuated backscatter [beta(m) - beta(o)] and near-surface aerosol mass. This suggests errors in near surface attenuated backscatter can be attributed to errors in the amount of aerosol estimated by the NWP scheme. Correlation increases when cases of high relative humidity in the NWP model are excluded. Given the impact on aerosol optical properties demonstrated, results suggest the use of a fixed, bulk aerosol for urban areas in the UKV should be revisited and the lidar ratio should be constrained. As quality of the observed attenuated backscatter is demonstrated to be critical for performing model evaluation, careful sensor operation and data processing is vital to avoid false conclusions to be drawn about model performance.

AB Human activities have greatly increased the emission of reactive nitrogen (N) to the atmosphere, leading to large increases in N deposition in sensitive ecosystems. However, few have measured both the wet and dry deposition of individual N species in southeast China and their impact on surface water quality. We investigated wet and dry deposition of N, including gaseous NH3, NO2 and HNO3, and particulate NH4+-N and NO3--N in both the atmosphere and precipitation during a two-year period at three sites in the Taihu Lake region in southeast China. The total N deposition in this region was 64.8 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) (range: 59.1-70.5 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)). On an annual basis, the ratio of reduced to oxidized N deposition was 1.7, suggesting that the reduced form of N dominates N deposition. Of the annual N deposition, 45.5% was deposited via precipitation, with the remaining via dry deposition. The total gaseous and particulate N deposition was 24.9 and 10.4 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. The high N loading in this region has resulted in the reduction of water quality in Taihu Lake. Atmospheric N deposition accounted for 33.3 and 27.5% of the total N loading in Taihu Lake and in water bodies in the region, respectively. We conclude that dry deposition of N is one of the most important sources of surface water pollution and should be taken into account when developing strategies for mitigating water pollution.

AB Strict emission control measures are being implemented in China and India to improve air quality and protect human health, yet current air quality driven and sector based measures without consideration of climate effects would likely taccelerate warming. In this study, we attribute aerosol direct radiative forcing in China and India to emitting sectors using a fully online coupled meteorology-chemistry model (WRF-Chem, Weather Research and Forecasting Model coupled with Chemistry) for the entire year of 2013. Our simulations show that the observed spatial and temporal variations of aerosol concentrations and optical properties are generally reproduced by the model, although sulfate is biased low in winter due to missing aqueous/heterogeneous pathways in the model. Aerosols from all sectors result in negative direct forcing at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) in both China (-2.21 W/m(2)) and India (- 3.18 W/m(2)), which are largely contributed by the power sector. The residential sector in both China and India largely heats the atmosphere because of its dominant contribution to black carbon emissions. In both China and India, the longwave radiative forcing (0.86 and 1.21 W/m(2) for China and India) is tiny compared to the shortwave radiative forcing (- 3.07 and - 4.39 W/m(2) for China and India). The seasonality of sectoral radiative forcing in China is different from that in India. These results suggest that residential sector should be targeted to achieve both air quality and climate change goals, yet the control of emissions from the power sector is very likely to accelerate warming.

AB Nitrates are important components of atmospheric aerosols. Organic components are widely present in the atmosphere, while their influence on the hygroscopicity of nitrates has not been fully explored. The hygroscopic growth of nitrate aerosols internally mixed with water-soluble organic acids (succinic acid, glutaric acid and citric acid) was measured using a hygroscopic tandem differential mobility analyzer (HTDMA). The hygroscopic behaviors of ammonium nitrate/succinic acid mixed particles exhibited the effect of organic acid content on the phase state of ammonium nitrate, indicating that the minor succinic acid content (less than 50% by mass) does not efficiently initiate the crystallization of NH4NO3 in submicron mixed particles. The obvious particle shrinkage with increasing RH under low humidity conditions was observed for sodium nitrate or calcium nitrate particles mixed with citric acid, suggesting the influence of citric acid on the nitrate particle structure. Our results indicate that due to the complexation of carboxylic groups of polycarboxylic acid some water-soluble carboxylic acids have a potential role in transformation of the dry submicron calcium nitrate particle structure. Our findings highlight the importance of water-soluble organic acids in water uptake behaviors of nitrates, further improving the understanding of phase behavior and water uptake of nitrates in atmospheric aerosols.

AB Before the 21st century, visibility monitoring techniques are mainly categorized by human eye-based and optical-based measurements. In order to automate and objectify the former measurement, the latter measurement method has been developed and meteorological optical range (MOR) is used as a concept similar to the visual range. However, in the 21st century, MOR has been found to have some differences with visual range that is recognized by human beings. As image analysis technology is improved, a variety of image-based on-site visibility measurement techniques are being developed using a camera. In this study, image-based visibility measurement that is based on the measured distance to visible objects was performed at about 3 km northwest of the Seoul Meteorological Observatory where the human eye-based and the optical-based visibility monitoring are observed simultaneously. As a result of correlation analysis between three measurement data, the image-based visual range (IVR) was found to be more comparable to the human eye-based visual range (HVR) than to the optical-based MOR. HVR tended to be lower than IVR as visibility improved, but MOR was predominantly higher than IVR as visibility was reduced. Perceived visibility measurement of IVR and HVR were revealed to be more accurate in severe poor visibility conditions. In this study, the system uncertainty of IVR estimation is expected to be within 10% up to about 33 km and approach 20% under above a hundred km of visibility. The Visual Range Meter (VRM) program developed for IVR estimation was made up of an individual measurement mode and a real-time measurement mode. The operational errors of approximately 15% excluding precipitation and other meteorological effects occurred in real-time IVR estimation using the VRM.

AB Black carbon is emitted from the incomplete combustion of carbonaceous fuels and will detrimentally affect air quality, climate and human health. In this study, equivalent black carbon (eBC) concentrations were measured by using an aethalometer (AE33) at three different locations in the Helsinki metropolitan area, Finland from October 2015 to May 2017. One sampling site was located in an urban street canyon (SC, sampling period 18 months) and two of the sampling sites were located in suburban detached house (DH) areas (DH1, 13 months and DH2, 5 months). Based on the campaign averages, the eBC concentration levels were higher at the street canyon site (1690 +/- 1520 ng/m(3)) than at the residential detached house areas (DH1 = 880 +/- 1500 ng/m(3) and DH2 = 1040 +/- 2130 ng/m(3)). The contribution of eBC from fossil fuel (BCFF) and wood burning (BCWB) were estimated based on the spectral dependence of light absorption of different sources. The spectral behavior is described using absorption Angstrom exponent (alpha) values for both fossil fuel (alpha(FF)) and wood burning (alpha(WB)) that were determined using concurrent wood burning tracer (levoglucosan) measurements. Based on the source apportionment, the contribution of BCWB to eBC was clearly higher at the detached house area sites DH1 (41 +/- 14%) and DH2 (46 +/- 15%) than at the urban street canyon site (15 +/- 14%). A distinct seasonal dependency was observed in the eBC concentration levels at the detached house areas. The highest concentrations were detected during the cold seasons due to residential wood combustion. On the opposite, at the SC site, the concentration levels of eBC were rather constant throughout the campaign, being dominated by the BC FF emissions from close-by vehicular traffic. Substantial temporal and spatial variability in eBC concentrations and sources were observed within the Helsinki metropolitan area. eBC is shown to be closely tied to the characteristics of the measurement site, season, meteorological conditions and the time of the day.

AB Cookstoves have wide-reaching impacts on human health, air quality, and the climate. We measured emissions from uncontrolled cooking in 41 households in China, Honduras, Uganda, and India using a portable sampler. Test sites were chosen to cover a range of stove types (traditional and "improved"), fuels (wood, charcoal and coal), and cooking practices. We report test-integrated fuel-based emission factors (EFs) of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) mass, organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC), as well as real time EFs of carbon monoxide (CO), black carbon (BC), total particle number, and particle size distributions. There was substantial house-to-house variability in emissions; the distribution of EFs were also highly positively skewed by several "superemitter" stoves in China (those with PM2.5 EFs 5-20 times greater than the median value). The highest PM2.5 mass emission factors were measured in China (median:10.3 g/kg-fuel), and the lowest in Uganda (median: 1.7 g/kg-fuel). The median PM2.5 mass EFs in wood-burning stoves in Honduras and India were similar: 3.7 g/kg-fuel and 4.1 g/kg-fuel, respectively. However, Indian stoves had higher EC EFs then Honduran stoves, demonstrating that emissions depend on more that fuel type; regional differences, such as cooking styles and stove design, may influence aerosol properties as well. Coal and charcoal stoves had higher OC:EC than wood stoves. The differences between the CO, PM2.5, and OC:EC ratios of "improved" and traditional stoves in India and Honduras were not statistically significant. To the best of our knowledge, we report the first cookstove source size distributions measurements from uncontrolled in-home cooking. These distributions varied between countries, which will influence local radiative effects. Particle size distributions from stoves tested in China, Honduras, and India were unimodal in the size range measured, with geometric mean diameters (GMDs) of 66 nm, 48 nm, and 76 nm, respectively. The median GMD of particles emitted from Ugandan charcoal stoves was 39, and when all tests are averaged, the resulting distribution appears tri-modal, with modes near 15, 30, and 100 nm. Real-time emissions data reveal high BC and particle number emissions during startup and fuel additions, which can be seen in the positively skewed distributions. Emissions of BC were most skewed, indicating that they were highly event-driven, followed by total particle number. CO emissions were more evenly spread across cooking events.

AB In order to improve our ability to predict cloud properties, radiative balance and climate, it is crucial to understand the mechanisms that trigger the formation of new particles and their growth to activation sizes. Using an array of real time aerosol measurements, we report a categorization of the aerosol population taken at Villum Research Station, Station Nord (VRS) in North Greenland during a period of 88 days (February-May 2015). A number of New Particle Formation (NPF) events were detected and are herein discussed. Air mass back trajectories analysis plotted over snow-sea ice satellite maps allowed us to correlate early spring (April) NPF events with air masses travelling mainly over snow on land and sea ice, whereas late spring (May) NPF events were associated with air masses that have passed mainly over sea ice regions. Concomitant aerosol mass spectrometry analysis suggests methanesulfonic acid (MSA) and molecular iodine (I-2) may be involved in the NPF mechanisms. The source of MSA was attributed to open leads within the sea ice. By contrast, iodine was associated with air masses over snow on land and over sea ice, suggesting both abiotic and biotic sources. Measurements of nucleating particle composition as well as gas-phase species are needed to improve our understanding of the links between emissions, aerosols, cloud and climate in the Arctic; therefore our ability to model such processes.

AB To evaluate the bottom-up NOx emission inventories with different data sources and spatial scales, an updated product of tropospheric NO2 vertical column densities (VCDs) from Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), POMINO, was applied in chemistry transport modeling (CTM) and Gaussian function model for southern Jiangsu, a typical developed and polluted region in eastern China. Compared to the national emission inventory (MEIC), better correlation was found between spatial distributions of the high-resolution provincial inventory (JS) and POMINO VCDs. When applied in CTM, the simulated VCDs using JS were closer to POMINO data than those using MEIC, indicating the advantage of the provincial inventory that incorporated detailed information of individual plants. The simulated VCDs, however, were generally larger than observed ones, particularly for regions with high NO2 levels, partly because the improved NOx control measures for power sector were not fully considered in both national and provincial inventories. The "top-down" NOx emissions were estimated for four cities/city combinations in southern Jiangsu, using a Gaussian function model based on POMINO NO2 VCDs. The results were found to be most consistent with the estimates in JS among bottom-up inventories with different data sources. To further harmonize emissions and satellite observations at relatively small spatial scale, the online emission measurement data for individual plants are recommended for emission inventory development, and the products of satellite observation data with finer horizontal resolution are encouraged.

AB This study synthesizes for the first time results from simultaneous aerosol measurements performed at seven diverse locations distributed all over the Spanish geography. The observations were carried out during two field campaigns in 2012-2013, one-month each and during different seasons. These field campaigns were performed in the framework of the Spanish Network of DMAs (REDMAAS) activities. Measurement sites were grouped as polluted sites (urban background) and clean sites (rural background and high-altitude sites). Seasonal differences were more important at polluted sites, mainly related to meteorology and aerosol sources. Higher total particle concentrations were found during the cold period, driven mainly by Aitken-mode particles (traffic-related aerosol particles). In clean sites, particle concentrations were higher during the warm period. Mild meteorological conditions in combination with the absence of local sources during the cold period make atmospheric nucleation an important contributor to ultrafine particles. These results are reflected in aerosol dynamical processes. Ultrafine particle bursts were frequent in both periods at the clean sites and in the warm period at most polluted sites. Shrinkages processes were identified at three sites (two polluted and one clean site) during the warm period. Meteorology (wind speed and solar radiation) and a highly-volatile aerosol (formed from atmospheric nucleation or traffic emissions) explain this behaviour. Ultrafine particles exhibited a different behaviour at inland and coastal sites. The highest total particle concentrations were observed at coastal sites during the warm period. At these sites, the smallest particle modal diameters and the highest variations of particle number size distributions in the smaller particle size range were also found, particularly in the warm period. This may be the result of the high diffusion conditions and mixing of different air masses (clean and polluted) caused by sea-land breezes. Our findings can be explained by the local and regional characteristics of each site, such as meteorology and aerosol sources (types, proximity ...) and the influence of meteorology on atmospheric transformation processes.

AB Monitoring and mapping of atmospheric deposition can be achieved by use of chemical transport models, technical sampling devices and/or bio-accumulators such as mosses, lichens, etc. Within the European Moss Survey programme, since 1990 every 5 years mos specimens have been collected and analysed for heavy metals, nitrogen and persistent organic pollutants according a harmonised methodology. Calculation and geostatistical mapping of percentile statistics of element concentration in moss is in the focus of this paper. Thereby, element- and survey-specific as well as heavy metals and surveys integrating statistical evaluations and GIS-mapping were performed. Cr, Sb and Zn show contrary to Fe and Pb, no constant decrease of element concentrations, but an intermediate increase between 2000 and 2005, which did not continue until 2015. Cd, Hg, Pb and N which are of priority according to the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution are in focus in this paper. Additionally, Cr is regarded as representing those elements with an intermediate increase between the years 2000 and 2005 as is also true for Sb and Zn. Surveys integrating percentile statistics depict the spatial patterns of, in most cases, declining element concentrations across time. Survey-specific statistical analyses corroborate that the spatial patterns of element concentrations in moss are changing element-specifically across time. The long-term information on the percentile statistics of bioaccumulation of atmospheric deposition in moss is essential for further scientific evaluation as well as for measurements and reporting of nature protection and environmental management.

AB Local aerosol composition impacts human health, as toxicity depends on particle concentration, composition, and size. We have thus studied local aerosol composition in University Park, PA from September-November of 2014 and 2015 to determine the composition and morphology of ambient particles using Transmission Electron Microscopy. In particular, we explored how local aerosol composition is affected as local and regional power plants converted from coal to natural gas consumption. Our results indicate a decline in the fraction of fractal particles (soot and fly ash) from 2014 to 2015 due to the conversion of the local power plants. Since fly ash and soot are often associated with hazardous substances such as heavy metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, decreases in these particle types suggest a trend that could benefit human health at the local level.

TI Impact of residential combustion and transport emissions on air

AB Santiago (33.5 degrees S, 70.5 degrees W), the capital of Chile, is frequently affected by extreme air pollution events during wintertime deteriorating air quality (AQ) and thus affecting the health of its population. Intense residential heating and on-road transport emissions combined with poor circulation and vertical mixing are the main factors responsible for these events. A modelling system composed of a chemistry-transport model (CHIMERE) and a meteorological model (WRF) was implemented to assess the AQ impacts of residential and transportation sources in the Santiago basin. A two-week period of July 2015 with various days with poor AQ was simulated focusing on the impact on AQ with respect to fully inhalable particles (PM2.5) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). Three emission scenarios, within the range of targeted reductions of the decontamination plan of Santiago, were tested; namely 50% reduction of residential emission, 50% reduction of transport emissions and the combination of both. An additional scenario decreasing transport emissions in 10% was carried out to examine whether a linear dependence of surface concentrations on changes in emissions exists.
   The system was validated against surface and vertically resolved meteorological measurements. The model reproduces the daily surface concentration variability from the AQ monitoring network of Santiago. However, the model not fully captures the emissions variations inferred from the observations which may be due to missing sources such as resuspension of dust.
   Results show that, during the period studied, although both residential and transportation sources contribute to observed AQ levels in Santiago, reducing transport emissions is more effective in terms of reducing the number of days with pollution events than decreasing residential combustion. This difference in impact is largely due to the spatial distribution of the emission sources. While most of the residential combustion is emitted in the outskirts of the city, most of the transport emissions occur within the city, where most of the stations from AQ monitoring network of Santiago are located. As can be expected, the largest improvement of AQ in Santiago is achieved by the combined reduction of emissions in both sectors. Sensitivity analysis with 10% reduction in transport emissions reveals a linear behavior between emissions and concentrations for NOx and approximate linear behavior for PM2.5. The absence of secondary aerosols formation and dust resuspension in the current simulation could explain this deviation from linearity for fine particles. Nevertheless, it suggests that the results can be used for mitigation policies with emissions reductions below the 50% used in this study.

AB The Yangtze River Delta (YRD), one of the most important developed urban regions in eastern China, has been experiencing severe air pollution due to the rapid economic development. VOCs characterization and sources were studied based on ship-based measurements along the mid-lower Yangtze River (MLYR). The measured VOCs mean concentration was (65.5 +/- 16.8) ppbv, among which alkanes, alkenes, oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs), aromatics and halogenated hydrocarbons (XVOCs) are (26.4 +/- 7.2) ppbv, (11.3 +/- 3.6) ppbv, (11.3 +/- 4.6) ppbv, (6.3 +/- 2.6) ppbv, (5.9 +/- 2.7) ppbv, and (4.4 +/- 1.8) ppbv, respectively. Interestingly, the present result shows much lower aromatics fractions and higher long-lived species fractions than those in YRD's urban and suburban areas, which is similar to those in rural areas, but higher ship emissions-related species fraction than those in rural areas. The positive matrix factorization (PMF) model is used to identify and apportion the possible sources of ambient VOCs along the MLYR. According to source apportionment, the shipping emission takes up (23.5 +/- 20.0)% of total VOCs on average. Moreover, the other three sources are also identified for VOCs with somewhat spatial variability, including chemical and petrochemical industries (12.9 +/- 9.2%), combustion-related emissions (36.1 +/- 17.9%), and regional aged air mass (27.5 +/- 16.2%). In general, the VOCs sources in the waterway are very different from those published results over urban and suburban areas in the YRD. The present study highlights that rural VOCs pollution should be paid attentions to, and common differentiated controlling measures are essential to reduce emissions in the whole YRD.

AB In recent years many households in northern China's rural areas tend to furnish their houses with water-circulating piping system for heating, which entails mini-boiler stoves to heat water via raw coal chunk or biomass pellets. In this study, consistent efforts were made to obtain first-hand emission factors of organic carbon (EFOC) and elemental carbon (EFEC) for residential solid fuel combustion. A total of 39 fuel/stove combinations, covering seven coals (with different geological maturities), eleven biomass fuels, and five different stoves, were tested. The mean EFOC and EFEC were (4.29 +/- 2.33) and (4.43 +/- 2.18) g/kg for residential coal combustion, (2.16 +/- 4.47) and (0.42 +/- 1.01) g/kg for indoor biomass burning. The EFs for tested coal combustion display a "bell shape" with the maximum EF value occurring at bitumite of middle maturity. Coal briquetting in this study led to a significant decrease in EFEC but a notable increase in EFOC, which contradicted with the result from some of previous studies that coal briquetting always leads to relatively low emissions of both OC and EC. The inside reason deserves further clarification. Averaging over the two mini-boiler stoves shows that the introduction of mini-boiler stoves can reduce 5% and 10% of OC from anthracite and bitumite, respectively, and 47% and 53% of EC from anthracite and bitumite, respectively, suggesting that transfer from pure heating stoves to mini-boiler stoves seems unlikely to increase carbonaceous particle emissions, particularly EC. The more significant decline in EFEC than in EFOC indicates that the access to mini-boiler stove for winter heating is very likely to be both a clean air measure and a warming mitigation approach. Updated emission inventories in China for the year of 2014 showed that the OC and EC emissions were 338 Gg and 529 Gg, respectively, from residential coal combustion, and 557 Gg and 79 Gg, respectively, from household biomass burning.

AB Middle East Area and especially the central part is a dust dominated domain and therefore estimation of natural dust emissions is critical. Aim of this study is to assess the sensitivity of state-of-the art dust modules, utilized in multiple modelling schemes, and especially of their three main components; namely the horizontal mass flux, the drag partition and the sandblasting efficiency. To accomplish this, several simulations with the Natural Emission MOdel (NEMO), driven by the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, were made for the period April-June 2015 focusing in the central Middle East (CME). First, the meteorological model was evaluated over the study period, as well as during a Shamal event, showing a satisfactory performance on wind speed which is the most important meteorological variable inserted in the dust modules. Second, dust emissions were found to be a few tenths of mu g/m(2) s on average, while the daily amount exceeds 1000 mg/m(2) day. Over the studied period, the fluxes range from 15 to 750 g/m(2). The total emissions in CME were estimated with the NEMO's basic configuration at 139 Tg. The most active areas are associated with clay content ranging between 17 and 25%, highlighting the importance of soil texture on the definition of the dust sources. During a Shamal event in the second half of June 2015, the mean dust emission fluxes reached up to several hundreds of mu g/m(2) s, contributing 21 Tg in CME. Few such events could cover a large portion of the dust emissions. Finally, concerning the sensitivity of the total emissions, the drag partition scheme has the largest effect, followed by sandblasting efficiency and horizontal mass flux. The total dust emissions budget, among the 16 simulations was found to be in the range of 21-139 Tg, with the choice of the drag partition scheme to be mandatory for the narrowing of the total emissions in CME.

AB The rate constants of the reaction of nitrate and methoxymethyl peroxy, acetonyl peroxy and beta-hydroxy (methyl)propylperoxy radicals were measured using laser photolysis coupled with time resolved UV-Visible spectrometry and laser diode spectroscopy over the temperature range 276-356 K, for pressures varying between 280 and 480 Torr and was performed under dry conditions. This work provides the first kinetic data for the reaction of NO3 + CH3OCH2O2, NO3 + CH3C(O)CH2O2 and NO3 + (CH3)(2)C(OH)CH2O2 as a function of temperature leading to the following Arrhenius expressions (in cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1)):
   CH3OCH2O2 + NO3: k(1) (T) = (1.36 +/- 0.70) x 10(-11) exp (-(435 +/- 150/T))
   CH3C(O)CH2O2 + NO3: k(2) (T) = (5.47 +/- 1.66) x 10(-12) exp (-(282 +/- 95/T))
   (CH3)(2)C(OH)CH2O2 + NO3: k(3) (T) = (1.60 +/- 1.27) x 10(-11) exp (-(480 +/- 255/T))
   These reactions between NO3 and RO2 radicals exhibit a low positive temperature dependence over the temperature range 276-356 K indicating that the initiation step involved in the reaction between RO2 and NO3 is carried out without an activation barrier. The effect of the peroxy radical structure on the kinetic of its reaction with nitrate radicals is relatively low. We also provide a brief discussion concerning the contribution of this process on the atmospheric elimination of RO2 in the atmosphere.

AB Air pollution is an environmental and social issue at different spatial scales, especially in a climate change context, with an expected decrease of air quality. Despite the technological evolution of the last decades in the transport sector, road traffic emissions are still one major source of air pollution at the city level. The main goal of this study was to evaluate the influence of a set of resilience measures, based on nature-based solutions, in the wind flow and in the dispersion of air pollutants, in a built-up area in Portugal. For that, two pollutants were analysed (NOx and PM10) and four scenarios were developed: i) a baseline scenario, ii) an urban green scenario, iii) a green roof scenario, and iv) a "grey" scenario (without trees). Two models were used, namely the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) and the CFD model VADIS (pollutant dispersion in the atmosphere under variable wind conditions). The WRF model was used to initialize the CFD model, while the last was one used to perform the set of numerical simulations, on hourly basis. The implementation of a green urban area promoted a reduction of air pollutants concentrations, of about 16% [PM10] and 19% [NOx] in the overall domain; while the application of green roofs showed an increase of concentrations (reaching 60% during specific time periods). Overall the results showed that a strategic placement of vegetation in cities has the potential to make an important contribution to the improvement of air quality and sustainability of urban environments.

AB Grazing has been reported to significantly affect the flux of three greenhouse gases (GHGs: CO2, CH4 and N2O) in grasslands, but its effect on total global warming potential (GWP) is still unclear. To assess the effect of grazing on GWP, we simultaneously measured the flux of these three GHGs using static chambers in meadow, typical, and desert steppes under no grazing (NG) and summer grazing (SG) conditions during the 2012-14 growing seasons. We aimed to examine the impact of grazing on total GWP across different steppes and to assess the relative contribution of different environmental factors to changes in GWP. Our results showed that total GWP values were almost entirely negative in all steppe environments and displayed high spatio-temporal variability. Net ecosystem exchange was the most important predictor of total GWP in all three steppes, and the positive GWP induced by N2O emission was approximately equal to the negative GWP induced by CH4 uptake. Steppe type and sampling year-but not grazing treatment-were found to affect GWP. Air temperature and precipitation were the major factors driving total GWP change under the no grazing treatment. In contrast, soil temperature, soil moisture, and precipitation explained a significant percentage of variation in total GWP under the summer grazing treatment. Our study suggests that moderate grazing does not change the role of temperate steppe's function in mitigating climate change; however, multi-year GWP data are necessary for extrapolation to a regional scale.

AB Field experiments offer the most acceptable approach to quantifying agricultural fumigant emissions but there is an absence of replicated field data in reported literature. Air concentration profiles of 1,3-dichloropropene (1,3-D) were determined on duplicate masts above the center of a treated field over 14 days. Meteorological parameters were also measured. Three meteorological approaches were then used to determine the total and flux density emissions of 1,3-D. Across the three calculation methods, the averages of the duplicated measurements showed total emission losses of cis 1,3-D ranging from 27% to 36% and of trans 1,3-D ranging from 18% to 24%. The replicate measurements differed by between 1.6 and 7.7 percentage points, which we consider to be excellent replicability. Flux densities over time showed maximum emissions during the first nighttime and early morning of the day following application. A general declining trend in emission fluxes was accompanied by nighttime peaks. Flux density curves during the experiment showed excellent agreement between replicates, with linear regression of the two data sets yielding r(2) values of 0.95-0.98 and slopes of 1.01-1.17. To our knowledge, this is the first time that replicated fumigant fluxes have been reported. The high degree of replicability indicates the robustness of the approaches and lends credence to previous non-replicated flux data.

AB Phoenix, Arizona is a designated ozone nonattainment area by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and is susceptible to unhealthy ozone during the summer North American Monsoon. This study identifies common July and August synoptic environments linked with daily exceedances and non-exceedances of the EPA National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS). Results indicate a common weather pattern for exceeding the NAAQS consisting of 1) an amplified high-pressure ridge over the Four Corners region causing 500 hPa heights to often exceed 5910 m, 2) surface afternoon temperatures typically rising over 40 degrees C, 3) lighter wind speeds in the planetary boundary layer (PBL) under four ms(-1), and 4) a distinct and persistent light easterly flow regime from 700 to 500 hPa. The last feature would counter local mountain-valley winds in the upper PBL to promote ozone accumulation aloft and subsequent fumigation. Conversely, non-exceedance days are associated with 1) West Coast troughing and 500 hPa geopotential heights between 5.9 and 21.4 m lower, 2) afternoon PBL temperatures on average 0.8 degrees C-2.2 degrees C cooler, 3) faster afternoon westerly flow at 925 and 850 hPa over four ms(-1), and 4) westerly flow in general at and above 925 hPa, aligning with the daytime mountain-valley circulation. Furthermore, a secondary non-exceedance pattern was identified. This less frequent pattern has moist southeast flow and is recognized for bringing widespread convective storm activity to central Arizona, including the PNA, based on prior research.

AB To quantitatively estimate the divergences in the natural and anthropogenic dust emission fluxes among different climatic regions, the total dust emissions at the global scale from 2007 to 2010 were simulated in this study. Despite the widely scattered anthropogenic dust distribution, the total area of potential anthropogenic dust sources was found slightly higher than that of natural dust sources. The anthropogenic dust distribution area was 1.61 x 10(7) km(2) in January and 1.54 x 10(7) km(2) in July, respectively. The natural dust sources contributed 81.0% of the global dust emissions and the anthropogenic contributed 19.0% of the residual. The natural and anthropogenic dust emission flux was 6.34 +/- 0.31 mu g m(-2) s(-1) and 1.01 +/- 0.07 mu g m(-2) s(-1), respectively. Especially, natural and anthropogenic dust emissions situated in different climatic regions. Natural dust emissions mainly located in hyper-arid and arid regions such as the Sahara, Arabian and Taklimakan Desert where dust emission fluxes range from 1 to 50 mu g m(-2) s(-1), accounted for 97.3% of natural dust emissions at the global scale. While anthropogenic dust emissions concentrate in semi-arid, sub-humid and humid regions and generally fluctuated between 0.1 and 10 mu g m(-2) s(-1). In addition, natural and anthropogenic dust proportions in semi-arid regions were the most complicated due to the complex land cover types, including grasslands, urban areas, croplands and open shrub lands, resulting in 42.99% of the anthropogenic dust emissions in semi-arid regions. The complex interplay of natural and anthropogenic dust emissions contributing to the total dust loadings may be a crucial factor enhanced the warming over semi-arid regions. This study provided confidence for the further investigation of the climatic impacts of natural and anthropogenic dust in different climatic regions under the background of global warming, especially the strengthening warming in semi-arid regions.

AB We tested the effect of increasing drought conditions in the Mediterranean Basin on isoprenoid emissions for the coming decades by analyzing their effect experimentally on the dominant Mediterranean species Erica multiflora in a Garraf shrubland and Quercus ilex in a Prades forest in Catalonia (Spain). Drought was simulated in Garraf using automatically sliding curtains to decrease the amount of soil moisture by 5% and in Prades by partial rainfall exclusion and runoff exclusion for a 25% decrease. We measured photosynthetic rates (A), stomatal conductance (g(s)) and rates of isoprenoid emission in the morning and at midday for four seasons and determined the relationship of emission rates with environmental conditions. Terpenes were emitted by both species, but only E. multiflora emitted isoprene. alpha-Pinene and limonene were the most abundant terpenes. Isoprenoid emissions increased with air temperature and generally decreased as the amount of soil moisture increased. The results of this study suggest that higher isoprenoid emissions can be expected in the warmer and drier conditions predicted for the coming decades in the Mediterranean region.

TI Estimating daily and intra-daily PM10 and PM2.5 in Israel using a

AB Satellite-based particulate matter (PM) models provide spatially and temporally resolved estimations, allowing greater spatial-temporal coverage compared to sparse ground monitoring stations. The spatio-temporal resolution of these models can be improved using aerosol optical depth (AOD) products from various satellite platforms with different overpass times which can capture possible changes in diurnal aerosol concentrations. Israel is characterized by diverse geo-climatic regions and it is subjected to frequent dust storms events. Our goal was to estimate PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations in Israel on daily and intra-daily (mean PM around the Aqua and Terra overpasses) temporal resolutions and to assess the differences between these time windows. A hybrid modeling approach that consists of three stages was used enabling spatially continuous PM estimations at 1 x 1 km spatial resolution. The model was calibrated on a daily basis applying a mixed modeling approach using MODIS-based MAIAC AOD and various spatial and temporal predictors. It was found that in certain urban areas the measured and estimated PM concentrations during the satellite overpass (Terra or Aqua) were higher than the mean daily PM. The models performed well showing cross-validated R-2 that ranged between 0.82 and 0.92. Mean estimated PM for the study period (2005-2015) during days with no dust events showed different spatial patterns for the daily and intra-daily estimations and revealed areas in Israel that are affected by high PM concentrations (mainly industrial or dense urban areas). Estimations from these models are useful for epidemiological research and might contribute to environmental regulatory purposes by focusing the efforts of PM pollution reduction at the identified polluted areas.

AB Despite of extensive efforts on investigation into characteristics of severe haze pollution in megacities of China, the accurate relationships among the aerosol composition, mass-size distribution and optical properties during pollution episodes remain poorly understood. Here, we conducted in situ measurements of the mass size distribution of submicron aerosol (PM1) species by using a High-Resolution Time-of-Flight Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS), particle light scattering by a Cavity Attenuated Phase Shift ALBedo monitor (CAPS-ALB) and a Photoacoustic Extinctionmeter (PAX) during the winter of 2017 in Shanghai, China. The average PM1 concentration was 85.9 +/- 14.7 mu g/m(3) during the haze episodes, of which was similar to 7 times higher than that of clean period (12.1 +/- 3.1 mu g/m(3)). Organic aerosol (OA) and inorganic species (SO42- + NO3- + NH4+) contributed 39.9% and 51.2% of the total mass of PM1 during the haze episodes, respectively. OA exhibited a single or bimodal distribution during the haze episodes with the peak concentration of 51.8 mu g/m(3). There were no obvious differences between ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) and ammonium sulfate ((NH4)(2)SO4) during the haze episodes, which exhibited single peak distributions at the sizes of 650-700 nm and similar to 700 nm, respectively. The peak positions of OA, (NH4NO3) and ((NH4)(2)SO4) in clean period were in the range of 450-500 nm, 550-600 nm and 450-500 nm with the peak concentrations of 5.5 mu g/m(3), 3.1 mu g/m(3) and 3.8 mu g/m(3), respectively. The increased scattering coefficients in the haze episodes were positively correlated with higher secondary inorganic aerosols and organic aerosol (OA). The high scattering coefficient contribution fraction peak diameter of (NH4NO3) and ((NH4)(2)SO4) were in the range of 600-800 nm and 600-750 nm with the peak scattering coefficient of 352.6 Mm(-1) and 165.7 Mm(-1), respectively. The size distribution of scattering for OA showed bimodal modes during all episodes. OA and NH4NO3 were the largest contributors to scattering coefficients of PM1 during the haze episodes, accounting for 45.5% and 37.8%, respectively. The contribution of (NH4)(2)SO4 to the scattering (24%) exceeded that of (NH4NO3) during clean period. Our results elucidated that substantial changes in the aerosols optical properties due to the changes in chemical compositions and size distribution during the haze events.

AB Large worldwide sources of dust, such as the Saharan desert, play a key role in the amounts and composition of atmospheric particulate deposition (APD), but their relative contribution compared to other sources remain unclear. Our study aimed to apportion Saharan, regional, and anthropogenic sources of APD in three sampling along a long transect affected by Saharan outbreaks. We quantified total APD, and analyzed its mineralogical and chemical composition between 2011 and 2012.. Strong markers of Saharan dust, such as large amounts of APD and of a low Al2O3:CaO ratio allowed identifying clear periods influenced by Saharan outbreaks. Nitrogen and phosphorus reflected soil affected by agricultural practices, while Cd, Pb, Sb and Sn tracked traffic and industrial sources-as confirmed by enrichment factors. Then, we designed a conceptual model including sensitivity analyses to estimate the contribution of unanalyzed (10-11%, likely chlorites or sulfates), organic (34-41%), anthropogenic (11-22%), mineral-regional (5-25%) and mineral-Saharan (10-38%) matter over our entire study period. Our study shows the rapidly decreasing contribution of Saharan outbreaks-and the decreasing flux of Ca and Mg, from 40 to 0.4 kg.ha(-1) over the study period between Algeria and France. Yet, Saharan outbreaks were still noticeable in APD at a site 1500 km away. Our study also shows the large relative contribution of organic and anthropogenic sources to APD in the three sampling sites, and their possible influence on nutrient budgets.

AB Methanesulfonic acid (MSA) is believed to play an important role in the formation and growth of atmospheric organic aerosols and could facilitate the binary nucleation of sulfuric acid (SA)-water (W). However, understanding of larger clusters formed by gas-phase MSA with atmospheric nucleation precursors from microscopic aspect is lacking. In this work, to study the microscopic mechanism of the ternary nucleation, the structural characteristics and thermodynamics of MSA clusters with SA in the presence of up to six W molecules have been investigated. It was found that MSA forms relatively stable clusters with SA and W molecules and that acid dissociation plays an important role. The analysis of the atmospheric relevance indicates that the heterodimer MSA-SA and monohydrated cluster MSA-SA-W-1 show an obvious relative concentration in the atmosphere, and thus, these species likely participate in new particle formation (NPF). However, with an increasing number of W molecules, the concentration of clusters gradually decreases. Additionally, the minimum energy isomer of MSA-SA-W-4 is predicted to possess a relatively stable configuration under the employed temperature dependence analysis, and evaporation rate analysis. The detailed non-covalent interactions of MSA-SA-Wn, n = 3-6 cluster have been thoroughly studied for the first time.

AB Black Carbon (BC) has been widely recognized as the second largest source of territorial and global climate change as well as a threat to human health. There has been serious concern of BC emission and its impact in Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) due to the use of biomass and fossil fuels for cooking, transportation and industrial activities. An attempt has been made to study indoor (Liquefied Petroleum Gas-LPG & Traditional cookstoves users households) and outdoor concentrations; seasonal characteristics; radiative forcing and source of apportionment of BC in three districts (Sitapur, Patna and Murshidabad) of IGP during January to December 2016. The seasonal concentrations of BC in LPG (traditional cookstoves) users households were 3.79 +/- 0.77 mu gm(-3) (25.36 +/- 5.01 mu gm(-3)) during the winter; 2.62 +/- 0.60 mu gm(-3) (16.36 +/- 3.68 mu gm(-3)) during the pre-monsoon; 2.02 +/- 0.355 mu gm(-3) (8.92 +/- 1.98 mu gm(-3)) during the monsoon and 2.19 +/- 0.47 mu gm(-3) (15.17 +/- 3.31 mu gm(-3)) during the post-monsoon seasons. However, the outdoor BC concentrations were 24.20 +/- 4.46, 19.80 +/- 4.34, 8.87 +/- 1.83, and 9.14 +/- 1.84 mu gm(-3) during winter, pre-monsoon, monsoon and post-monsoon seasons respectively. The negative radiative forcing (RF) at the surface suggests a cooling effect while a warming effect appears to be occurring at the top of the atmosphere. The atmospheric forcing of BC and aerosols also show a net warming effect in the selected study areas. The analysis of BC concentrations and fire episodes indicated that the emissions from biomass burning increases the pollution concentration. The backward trajectory analysis through the HYSPLIT model also suggests an additional source of pollutants during winter and pre-monsoon seasons from the northwest and northern region in the IGP.

AB In the case of landfills, the determination of odour emissions is particularly complex. Up to now, no universally accepted methodology for sampling and assessing emissions from landfill surfaces has been established. Besides, the dependence of such emissions from some crucial environmental variables, such as wind speed, has not been univocally defined yet. In this study, odour dispersion modelling and plume inspections by human assessors were combined in order to estimate the odour emissions from a landfill in Southern Italy. Two substantially different approaches were compared: the one that considers emissions as a function of the wind speed blowing over the surface, counterposed to the one that considers odour emissions as constant, in agreement with the most recent studies on the matter. The comparison of the field assessments and the model clearly highlights that the first approach significantly overestimates the landfill odour emissions, whereas the use of a constant odour emission rate results in a much better correspondence between model outputs and field assessments, both in terms of shape and extension of the determined odour plume extents.

AB Net ecosystem methane exchanges (NEME) from lowland rice often show significant variations in diurnal, seasonal and yearly scales and with crop phenology. Air and soil temperatures, standing water, and radiation are believed to be primary drivers of such variations. We studied the dynamics of net ecosystem methane exchange in three consecutive years (2014-16) using eddy covariance technology. Wet season (July October) showed higher diurnal methane flux variations than that of dry season (December March) due to prolonged anoxic condition and higher methanogens in the former. Significant diurnal variations in NEME were also noticed during different crop growth stages. Variations were higher in flowering stage followed by ripening in 2015 and 2016. But in 2014, it was highest at panicle initiation (PI) stage. Principal component bivariate plot analysis and performance analytic correlation were performed for variables such as net ecosystem carbon dioxide exchange (NEE), NEME, sensible heat (Hs), latent heat (LE), photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), net radiation (NR), air temperature and soil temperature (5 cm depth) in order to assess their relationships. The NEME was positively correlated to air and soil temperatures in all the years. However, in year 2016, NEME also showed positive correlation to PAR and NR. These relationships could provide valuable information to partitioning and process based simulation modelling for projecting and up scaling of NEME to regional and global scales.

AB Canopy reduction describes NO2 flux reduction at leaf stomata. We implemented the big-leaf reduction approaches of Wang et al. (1998) and Yienger and Levy (1995) in the Biogenic Emission Inventory System (BEIS) and compared them with the BEIS standard approach. The different reduction functions lead to a reduction of 17 Gg N or 27 Gg N respectively of nitrogen emission in comparison to the standard approach which reduces the nitrogen flux by about 1 Gg N in the three summer months of 2012. These are significant differences to the standard approach. The concentration reduction of oxidized reactive nitrogen in the model area shows also a significant reduction. While concentration reduction in central europe is low, in more rural regions of Europe, concentration changes are considerably higher. The calculated concentrations of NO2 show a significant improvement of the model performance when compared to EMEP observations in central Europe. This study favors the implementation and use of canopy reduction factors, especially the parameterization of Wang et al. (1998), for regional and global emission models for reasons of model physical correctness and improved model results.

AB The chemical composition and oxidative potential (OP) of particulate matter (PM10) samples were investigated at an industrial (Ala) and a background (TN) site in northern Italy. Three emission sources of airborne metals were identified by Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) analysis, i.e., the zinc coating facility located in the area, the traffic on the nearby motorway and the pesticides normally used in the extensive vineyard cultivation. PM10 redox activity was measured using dithiothreitol (OPVDTT) and ascorbic acid (OPVAA) cell-free assays. Similar OPVDTT responses were obtained at the two sites (0.60 +/- 0.23 mmol min(-1) m(-3)), while higher (OPVAA) values were measured at Ala (1.4 +/- 1.1 nmol min(-1) m(-3)) than at TN (0.7 +/- 0.4 nmol min(-1) m(-3)). Overall, both OPVDTT and OPVAA responses were found to be broadly correlated with several inorganic species, namely ions and soluble metals, and organic components. In particular, OPVAA responses are mainly affected by Zn directly emitted from the zinc factory and Cu used in the vineyard cultivation. Therefore, the higher OPVAA values measured at Ala can be explained by the higher concentration of these metals at the industrial site.

AB Urban residents spend the majority of time in indoor environments, which, however, may not be a safe haven for staying away from outdoor air pollution, especially in China. To examine this hypothesis, the particle mass concentrations (0.056-18 mu m) and number concentrations (14-660 nm) were simultaneously measured in and outside of three typical urban indoor settings (n = 9), i.e., school, office and residence in Guangzhou, China from October-November 2014 (dry weather season) and June-August 2015 (wet weather season). The indoor and outdoor particle number concentrations were positively correlated with each other at all three sampling settings for both dry and wet weather seasons (r(2) = 0.13-0.65, p < 0.001). The infiltration factors and indoor/outdoor ratios of particles (14-660 nm) were estimated at 0.30-0.75 and 0.85-1.5, respectively, which were comparable to or higher than those (0.12-0.76 and 0.03-1.1) found in cites of other countries under infiltration conditions. Furthermore, the average infiltration factor of fine particle numbers (50-660 nm) in an office was 0.61 during a severe haze episode, indicating that approximately 60% of outdoor particles penetrated indoors. All findings suggested an efficient transport of outdoor particle sources into indoor environment, confirming that exposure of the general public to indoor particles in China should not be overlooked due to effective infiltration of outdoor particles and frequent heavy haze episodes.

AB Custom-built HNO3(g) passive diffusion-based samplers employing nylon filters were comprehensively quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) tested, including analysis of the PTFE protective filters for potential bias. The passive samplers routinely quantified HNO3(g) mixing ratios in the Canadian boreal up to a factor of 20 lower compared to previous passive sampling dose-response determination and measurements. The use of appropriate blanks alongside field collections resulted in the detection of time-weighted mixing ratios as low as 5 parts per trillion by volume (pptv) over a monthly sampling period or 121 pptv over a 24-h sampling period. The nylon filters were tested for a single reuse to reduce resources required and no statistical difference between the measured mean value of reused and new filters between five replicates across four intercomparisons was found. This showed that a single nylon filter reuse in remote regions is sound as long as replicates are employed. The custom-built passive samplers were installed along the Newfoundland and Labrador - Boreal Ecosystem Latitudinal Transect (NL-BELT) to quantify mixing ratios of HNO3(g) in these forests. Samples generated monthly time-weighted average mixing ratios at the NL-BELT field regions. Samples were collected monthly across 15 months from the summer of 2015 through to the fall of 2016 on the order of tens to a hundred pptv. Across this time period the HNO3(g) mixing ratios ranged from 9 to 200 pptv - after incorporation of comprehensive field QA/QC - with seasonal maxima occurring during the early summer months. No consistent latitudinal trends were observed along the transect, except that the most northern region always corresponded to the lowest mixing ratios of HNO3(g) for a given observation period. Extracts of the protective PTFE filter and collocated measurements of temperature and humidity determined that previously uncertain effects on sampling accuracy likely result in a negative sampling bias of 10-30%. These unpowered devices are now demonstrated to be sensitive, affordable, simple, and redeployable for the continuous ultra-trace detection of HNO3(g) in regions such as the remote Canadian boreal forest.

AB The light scattering enhancement factor f (RH), defined as the ratio of the light scattering coefficient (sigma(SP)) observed under an elevated relative humidity (RH) conditions to that under dry conditions, is a crucial parameter for estimating aerosol direct radiative effects and atmospheric visibility. In this paper, a new f (RH) parameterization scheme considering both the influence of aerosol chemical compositions and that of particle number size distribution (PNSD) is proposed based on in situ measurements in the North China Plain. The development of this parameterization scheme includes three steps. First, aerosol hygroscopicity parameter kappa is parameterized with aerosol chemical compositions. Then, the ratio between f (RH) fitted parameter kappa(sca) (f(RH) = 1 + kappa(sca) RH/100 - RH) and kappa is introduced to correlate f (RH) with kappa. The ratio, influenced mostly by PNSD, is described as a function of scattering angstrom ngstrom exponent (SAE) because the SAE can represent the predominant size of aerosol particles to some extent. Finally, f (RH) cycle is parameterized with kappa(sca). Validation results show that a good consistency between the parameterized and measured f (RH = 80%) is achieved and the correlation coefficient is 0.80. This parameterization scheme between aerosol chemistry and f (RH) can be used in chemical transport models for reducing uncertainties in estimations of direct aerosol radiative forcing and air quality assessments.

AB Bioaerosols abundantly found in the atmosphere can potentially influence the climate by acting as ice nuclei and thus profoundly influencing the hydrological cycle. As the first attempt over India, we report the diversity, abundance, and ice nucleating ability of bacteria present in the rainwater collected at Chennai, during summer and two contrasting monsoon seasons. Diverse bacterial communities were present in all the twenty rainwater samples and predominantly belonged to Actinobacteria (6%), Alpha proteobacter (9%), Bacilli (29%), Betaproterobacteria (14%), Flavobacteria (3%), and Gammaproteobacteria (39%). The most efficient ice nucleating bacteria such as Pseudomonas sp. and Pantoea sp. were present in our precipitation samples and they contributed to 8.4% and 9.4% of the total cultivable bacterial species obtained. The relative abundance of Pseudomonas was highest during the south-west monsoon (75%) whereas Pantoea was abundant in the north-east monsoon (51.8%). The dominant bacteria belonging to the known ice nucleating genera Pseudomonas, Pantoea, and Bacillus were chosen for the determination of their freezing temperatures using tube freeze assay technique. The onset freezing temperature of species belonging to Pseudomonas and Pantoea was recorded as -12 degrees C and for those species belonging to Bacillus it was found to be -14 degrees C. Further, the number of bacterial cells making up an ice nucleus was estimated at the temperatures ranging from -18 degrees C to -12 degrees C for all the ice nucleating bacteria and it was found to vary from 10(6) to 10(9) (cells/nucleus).

AB Dust aerosol optical depth (AOD) simulated by the CHIMERE-DUST model over North Africa during 2006-2008 was evaluated by the SeaWiFS Deep Blue satellite data and AERONET ground based remote sensing measurements. The simulations were conducted using two meteorological inputs, ECMWF and CFSR forecast data, downscaled by the WRF model. The two simulations generated similar AODs and PM10 surface concentrations, which are highly correlated to dust emissions. The comparison of the simulated daily value of AOD with the satellite data showed good correlations (0.6-0.8) between them. A slightly better correlation was achieved using WRF-CFSR data. The regression coefficients fluctuated around 1.0 in cold months and decreased in summer, with minimums in August. The biases had similar seasonal cycles. This is consistent with the comparison against AERONET hourly AOD data that the model underestimated AODs in warm months at most stations. The comparison of PM10 surface concentration and dry deposition also showed negative biases in warm months at stations in the Sahel. The significant underestimation of wet deposition was found in monsoon season due to the unrealistic simulation of mesoscale convective system. It indicates that the low dust emission in August is partly associated with cold pools generated by the convective precipitation. Frequent overestimations of AOD were found in the northwest mostly because of the high dust emission produced by the overestimated winds near the Atlas Mountains. The dust emissions resulted from the two simulations were similar in terms of intra annual variations but differed in terms of annul dust emission. The estimated annual emission using WRF-CFSR data could be about 200 Tg more than the estimation using WRF-ECMWF data.

AB The U.S. Mid-Atlantic region is affected by transport of ozone and its precursors from upwind states and therefore local emission-reduction strategies are not necessarily the most effective to reach attainment. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive modeling effort with two photochemical models recommended by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency - the Community Multiscale Air Quality Model (CMAQ) and the Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions (CAMx) - inclusive of source apportionment and localized emission reductions, to study the extent of ozone precursor transport in the Mid-Atlantic and the efficacy of emission-reduction strategies, with a focus on Delaware. Delaware is a small state in the Mid-Atlantic region that is in nonattainment of the 2015 national 8-h ozone standard (0.070 ppm) despite its relatively low local emissions, thus it is an ideal test case to study transport. We found that in Delaware: 1) reducing local emissions of NOx and VOC by 20% is minimally effective; 2) the same emission reduction in each of five upwind states individually lowers ozone but not sufficiently to reach attainment; 3) only a consorted effort by the five upwind states together can lower Delaware ozone significantly; and 4) the emission reduction needed by the five states together is approximately 10%, half that of each individual state. This suggests that coordinated efforts and long-term, multi-state strategies are necessary to protect air quality in the Mid-Atlantic.

AB Regulation for ozone (O-3) precursor emissions began in Europe around 1990 with control measures primarily targeting industries and traffic. To understand how these measures have affected air quality, it is important to investigate the temporal evolution of tropospheric O-3 concentrations in different types of environments. In this study, we analyze long-term trends of the concentrations of O-3 and the sum of oxidants O-x (O-3 + NO2) in Switzerland for the last 25 years. Statistical decomposition of the observed time series is used to extract the underlying time scales, i.e. the long-term, seasonal and short-term variability. This allows subtraction of the seasonal variation of O-3 and O-x from the observations and estimation of long-term changes of de-seasonalized O-3 and O-x with reduced uncertainties. A two-regime trend calculation based on the long-term variability accounts for non-monotonic temporal evolution of O-3. In addition, adjustment of the higher frequency meteorological influence was applied, based on the time series containing the short-term variability. This led to an uncertainty reduction in the trend estimation, but only by a small factor. We observe that, despite the implementation of regulations and reduction of nitrogen oxides concentrations, for all studied sites daily mean O-3 values increased until mid-2000s. Afterwards, a decline or a leveling-off in the concentrations is observed. The start of change in the trend depends on the site type; the more polluted the site, the later is the onset of the change in trend behavior. At locations close to sources, the observed trend can mainly be explained by the reduced titration of O-3 by NO due to the strong reductions in nitrogen oxides emissions. At remote locations (such as the high alpine station in Jungfraujoch) that are influenced by hemispheric transport of O-3 an increase during 1990s and a decline after early 2000s is observed. The calculated temporal trends exhibit distinct differences depending on the characteristics and pollution burdens of the measurement sites; such differences have become smaller following emission reductions.

AB An inventory of anthropogenic emissions of twelve hazardous trace elements (HTEs): Hg, As, Se, Pb, Cd, Cr, Ni, Sb, Mn, Co, Cu and Zn, in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region of China is developed for 1980-2012 by using inter-annual dynamic emission factors, which are determined with S-shaped curves. Our results indicate that the BTH regional total emissions of twelve HTEs have rapidly increased from 2190.0 tons in 1980 to 8704.6 tons in 2012. Coal combustion by industrial boilers, ferrous metal smelting, glass production and brake wear are identified to be the primary sources of regional HTE emissions. Beijing is the largest Sb emitting city with about 20.0% of regional total emission. However, for other eleven HTE emissions, Tangshan represents as the highest emitting city, accounting for about 15.3-35.9% of the BTH totals. The peak HTE emission intensities (emissions per square kilometer) are mainly distributed over the grid cells of central and southeastern of the BTH region, especially for the urban and rural-urban border zones of cities. Generally, monthly variations of HTE emissions in the BTH region exhibit seasonal peak to valley characteristics. The overall uncertainties of the newly developed inventory are estimated to be from -35.7% to 36.4%. Finally, integrated countermeasures for emission reduction of HTEs are proposed.

AB Crop straw combustion is a significant source for humic-like substances (HULIS) in fine particles (PM2.5), which have strong light absorption in the near ultraviolet and visible light region. In this study, the relative abundances, light absorption properties and fluorescence characteristics of HULIS produced by three crop straws (wheat, rice and corn straws) combusted under different moisture contents and stacking modes were comprehensively characterized. The results show that the moisture contents and stacking modes can affect the ratio of carbon content in HULIS to water-soluble organic carbon (HULIS-C/WSOC) and the ratio of HULIS to PM2.5 (HULIS/PM2.5). The absorption Angstrom exponent (AAE) and absorptivity ratios between 250 and 365 nm (E2/E3) for HULIS increased either under high moisture or stacking conditions for all three crop straws, while mass absorption efficiencies at 365 nm (MAE(365)) decreased under high moisture or stacking conditions. Four fluorescent components of HULIS were identified based on the characterization of the excitation-emission matrix combined with a parallel factor analysis model (EEM-PARAFAC): protein-like organic matter (Cl and C4), highly oxygenated humic-like substances (C3) and less-oxygenated humic-like substances (C2). A correlation analysis of the fluorescent components and light absorption indicators showed that the components C4, (C2, C3) and (C1, C2) determined the variations in the light absorption properties of HULIS derived from wheat, rice and corn straw burning, respectively. We also found that the flame burning of crop straw could reduce the contribution of light absorption to HULIS per unit mass of crop straw.

AB A total number of 109 new particle formation events identified in the ion-mobility spectra measured with a Neutral Cluster and Air Ion Spectrometer in the mobility range of 3.16-0.00133 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) (Diameter* range 0.36-47.1 nm) at a tropical site at Pune, (18.53 degrees N, 73.85 degrees E, 573 m amse India from March 08, 2010-December 31, 2012 are classified based on their shape characteristics under four categories. Most of these events occurred in the morning hours of the pre-monsoon season during the hottest months (April and May) of the year. The meteorological conditions and the changes in ion characteristics associated with some typical events are examined. Average ion-mobility spectrum for the event days shows a minimum in the negative big cluster ion (diameter, 0.85-1.6 nm) concentration and two maxima in the positive intermediate (diameter, 1.6-7.4 nm) and large ion (diameter, 7.4-47.1 nm) concentrations as compared to the average spectrum for all days. Analysis of 7-days airmass back trajectories shows that since the only source of big cluster ions is through the growth of small cluster ions (diameter, 0.36-0.85 nm) the growth of small to big cluster ions is faster when the airmass approaches our site from the land. Further, the concentrations of positive intermediate and light large (diameter, 7.4-22 nm) ions is more when the airmass approaches from the Arabian Sea.

AB Estimating the spatiotemporal variability of ground-level PM2.5 is essential to urban air quality management and human exposure assessments. However, it is difficult in a high-density and highly heterogeneous urban context as ground-level monitoring stations are most likely sparsely distributed. Satellite-derived Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) observation has made it possible to overcome such difficulty due to its advantage of spatial coverage. In this study, we improve the AOD-PM2.5 correlations by combining land use regression (LUR) modelling and incorporating microscale geographic predictors and atmospheric sounding indices in Hong Kong. The spatiotemporal variations of ground-level PM2.5 over Hong Kong were estimated using MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) AOD remote sensing images for the period of 2003-2015. An extensive LUR variable database containing 294 variables was adopted to develop AOD-LUR models by seasons. Compared to the baseline models (fixed effect models include only basic weather parameters), the prediction performance of all annual and seasonal AOD-LUR fixed effect models were significantly enhanced with approximately 20-30% increases in the model adjusted R-2. On top of that, a mixed effect model covers time-dependent random effects and a group of geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR) models were also developed to further improve the model performance. As the results, compared to the uncalibrated AOD-PM2.5 spatiotemporal correlation (adjusted R-2 = 0.07, annual fixed effect AOD-only model), the calibrated AOD-PM2.5 correlation (the GTWR piecewise model) has a significantly improved model fitting adjusted R-2 of 0.72 (LOOCV adjusted R-2 of 0.65) and thus becomes a ready reference for spatiotemporal PM2.5 estimation.

AB A large fraction of emitted and ultimately deposited ammonia (NH3) originates from swine waste storage. Understanding the factors that influence these emissions is important in determining how to mitigate NH3 loading of the atmosphere. Hog manure is stored in slurry pits, tanks, or lagoons. Ammonia emissions from a ground-level mid-western hog finisher manure tank collecting manure from a mean of 3508 animals was measured for 8-20 d each quarter of the year for two years. Forty of the 164 measurement days had sufficient measurements to represent entire days. These daily emissions averaged 0.44 g NH3 m(-2)h(-1) (53.1 g d(-1) AU-1, 7.2 g d(-1) hd(-1): AU = 500 kg animal mass, hd = 1 animal) with maximum emissions of 1.62 g NH3 m(-2)h(-1) (194.2 g d(-1) AU(-1), 26.4 g d(-1) hd(-1)). Emissions from the tank were greater on an area basis but comparable on an animal basis relative to emissions from much larger anaerobic lagoons. Emissions were correlated with air temperature and manure composition, but not wind speed or friction velocity- probably due to the turbulence created by the tank structure under all winds. Crusting of the manure surface in the tank corresponded with a non-significant 10% increase in NH3 emissions. A model of the tank emissions, based on nominal nitrogen loading rates from the literature and taking into account the configuration of the circular tank, had a mean bias error of 0.01 g NH3 m(-2)h(-1) (0.9 g d(-1) AU-1, 0.1 g d(-1) hd(-1)) and a root mean square error of 0.26 g NH(3)m(-2)h(-1) (31.6 d(-1) AU-1, 4.3 g d(-1) hd(-1)). Additional emissions measurements from such ground-level manure storage tanks with greater documentation of the manure liquid composition are needed to verify the modeling approach.

AB In this study rainfall events were sampled sequentially between April and June 2014 (one event in April, two in May and one in June 2014) in the city center of Bolu province located in the western Black Sea Region of Turkey. Particle size distributions, pHs, major ion compositions and fractional distributions, neutralization factors and washout, rainout identifications were investigated by evaluating the data obtained from the sequences of the rain events. Local wind directions and upper atmospheric three dimensional back trajectory calculations were also used to identify the source regions affecting the receptor site. The primary purposes of this study were to present the effectiveness of washout and rainout processes and to identify the contributions of local and distant source regions to the rainfall events affecting the north western part of Turkey. The average pH values for the subsamples were determined as 5.20 +/- 0.47, 5.51 +/- 0.21, 6.97 +/- 0.23 (6.66-7.20) and 6.42 +/- 0.16 (6.17-6.66), respectively for the four rain events sampled. Ninety percent of the particles were smaller than 1135 gm for the first fraction, 444,5 gm for the second fraction, and 0.79 gm for the third fraction, respectively. Except for the fourth fraction, sequences of the rain event showed a linear decrease in particle sizes. The highest rainout to washout ratios were observed for nitrate ion (72.4%) and followed by ammonium ion (63.5%), chloride (48.4%), sulfate (46.3%), magnesium ion (41.5%), and potassium ion (31.2%). Strong correlations of nitrate and sulfate with Ca2+, Mg2+ and Na+ suggested that the rain droplets were neutralized by these alkaline ions.

AB In this study, we present simulations of the global dust cycle for present day conditions using a new dust-atmosphere model based on the Non-hydrostatic Icosahedral Atmospheric Model (NICAM) coupled with the Spectral Radiation Transport Model for Aerosol Species (SPRINTARS), We focus on evaluations of the dust simulation with respect to emissions, depositions, surface concentrations, aerosol optical depths (AODs), and the dust-aerosol direct radiative effects (DREs). The sensitivities of the dust simulation to the meteorological fields are also investigated through with and without meteorological nudging. NICAM without meteorology nudging tends to systemically overestimate the 10 m wind speeds by approximately 30%-40%, whereas the daily magnitudes and variations in the 10 m wind speeds are both significantly improved with meteorological nudging, especially over the Sahara Desert. The estimated annual global mean dust emission flux, dust AOD, and dustaerosol shortwave DRE at the top of the atmosphere with meteorological nudging are 1463 Tg yr(-1), 0.033, and -1.3 Wm(-)(2), respectively. Due to the approximately 30%-40% overestimations of the 10 m wind speeds over the two major desert regions, the estimated annual global mean dust emission flux, AOD, and DRE without meteorological nudging are significantly greater than those with meteorological nudging. The overestimations of 10 m wind speeds and the associated dust emissions are mainly caused by the positive biases of wind speeds especially from surface to approximately 2 km and slightly affected by the temperature fields. The monthly variations in the dust depositions over the Atlantic and the surface dust concentrations over the Pacific are all better simulated with meteorological nudging. Compared to both the AERONET (Aerosol Robotics Network)and MODIS (Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer)- retrieved AODs, the simulated daily AOD variations are significantly improved with meteorological nudging, especially over the dust-aerosol dominated regions. The global and annual mean dust lifetime and size distribution, which are two critical factors for estimating dust radiative effects, are quite similar between the dynamic and nudged NICAMs. We therefore can use the dynamic model to understand climate-dust interactions in a global and annual scale. Furthermore, we can improve the model performances for some applications in regional and seasonal scales by meteorological nudging which probably cannot be achieved by just tuning the dust emission.

AB Environmental magnetism, and the magnetic leaf signal in particular, is amply investigated and applied as proxy for atmospheric particulate matter pollution. In this study, we investigated the magnetic signal of annual segments of tree branches, and the composition of particles deposited hereon. Branches are, contrary to leaves of deciduous trees, available during leaf-off seasons and exposed to air pollution year-round. We examined the intra- and inter-tree variation in saturation isothermal remanent magnetization (SIRM) of branch internodes of London plane (Platanus x aeerifolia Willd.) trees in an urban environment. The branch SIRM, normalized by surface area, ranged from 18 to 650 x 10(-6) angstrom; the median amounted to 106 x 10(-6) angstrom. Most of the branch magnetic signal was attributed to the epidermis or bark, and the presence of metal-containing particles on the branch surfaces was confirmed by SEM-EDX. The location of the trees and the height, the depth in the crown and the age of the branches significantly influenced the branch SIRM. The median branch SIRM was up to 135% higher near a busy ring road than in quiet environments (city park and quiet street canyon), and was linked to the presence of Fe-rich particles with co-occurrence of trace metals such as Cr, Cu, Zn and Mn on the branch surface. Within the tree crowns, the branch SIRM generally decreased with increasing height, and was 22% higher in the interior than at the periphery of the crowns. Within the branches, the SIRM increased with each year of exposure, but did not relate to year-to-year variation in particle concentrations due to branch surface changes (epidermis shedding). Our results provide indications that branches can be a valuable alternative for biomagnetic monitoring of particulate pollution, but intra-tree variability in branch SIRM can be substantial due to the branch's location in the tree and branch age.

AB An elevated pollution layer (EPL) at altitude -1700 m was observed over the North China Plain (NCP) in November 2016. The vertical profiles of aerosol loadings, chemical compositions and meteorological parameters were in-situ measured at both ground and aircraft platforms. The EPLs were observed simultaneously over Beijing and Baoding city (-150 km distance between) with similar aerosol concentration and size distribution, indicating the impact of the EPL at regional scale. The synoptic and remote sensing analysis suggest the pollutants in the EPL may result from regional transport from the polluted southwest, and then elevated by the influence of anticyclone circulation and surrounding terrain. The descent air mass next day may lead to EPL entrainment and contribute to increased aerosol concentration at lower level. The non-refractory compositions measured by aerosol mass spectrometer showed more significant fraction of nitrate and secondary organics in the EPL compared to the other layers. The pollutants in the EPL was then mixed into the developed planetary boundary layer (PBL), leading to uniform distribution of aerosol composition. Such atmospheric stratification at high level and its subsequent impact on the lower level needs to be considered for the future radiative forcing study over this region.

AB Emissions and meteorological conditions are two important factors on aerosol accumulation or dilution. Identifying the contributions of both emission reduction (ER) and meteorological conditions (MC) on aerosol pollution abatement is a hot topic recently. An objective assessment of ER measures' contribution on improving air quality is also of great significance. This study focuses on objective assessment for the air quality improvements (known as "Blue Sky") due to ER measures. A quantitative algorithm on identifying the contribution of ER measures was proposed. The emission-reducing contributions to the "Beijing blue" (August 20 to September 3, 2015, Beijing, International Association of Athletics Federations World Athletics Championships), the "Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) blue" (November 10-11, 2014, Beijing, APEC meeting), and the "Games blue" (November 12-27, 2010, Guangzhou, 16th Asian Games) were studied based on pollutant MC of Parameters Linking Air-quality to Meteorological Conditions index. Two individual evaluation algorithms of an average change rate algorithm and a parameter fitting method were developed in this study. Results showed that the special comprehensive emission-reducing measures contributions were up to 26%-30% for "Beijing blue." By analyzing the circulation anomaly during the "Beijing blue" with 30-year average historical atmospheric circulation and the real-time information in 3rd September 2015, we concluded that the "North China Cold Vortex," as unusual stable circulation system stagnation, provides favorable weather conditions for the "Beijing blue." This finding Indicates that approximately 70%-74% of the "Beijing blue" came from long terms of favorable weather conditions. This algorithm for evaluating the contributions of ER and MC was also applied for the "APEC blue" and the "Games blue." The contribution of emission-reducing measures on the "APEC blue" and the "Games blue" accounted for 36% and 25%, respectively. In summary, the favorable MC would contribute 65%-75% to the "Blue Sky" in China and acts as a remarkable role on the improvement of air quality.

AB This study investigates the effect of feedstock drying on the emissions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) associated with the particulate matter (PM) produced during the co-generation of biochar and bioenergy. Raw pyrolysis volatile mixtures were generated from the pyrolysis of rice husk at 400, 500, 600, 700, and 800 degrees C using a laboratory-scale continuous pyrolysis-combustion system and combusted at 850 degrees C. PM samples from the combustion were collected and analysed for 15 priority PAH species with a gas chromatography/mass spectrometer (GC/MS). It was found that the utilization of the as received (AR) rice husk resulted in significantly greater energy-based yields of PM 10 (1.2 times at 400 degrees C and 1.6 times at 800 degrees C) than the dried rice husk. The majority of the increase was of the PMzi-io size fraction. The PM-bound PAH concentration was found to be 2.1 and 2.8 times higher for the AR rice husk at 400 and 800 degrees C, respectively. This resulted in a significant increase in the energy-based yield of PAHs over the entire volatile production temperature range for the AR rice husk. Nevertheless, the majority of the PM-bound PAH species generated from the AR rice husk consisted of 2 and 3 ring PAHs (naphthalene, acenapthylene, and acenaphthene) with relatively low toxicity. The concentration of 4, 5, and 6 ring PAHs was generally lower than that generated from the dried rice husk. This resulted in the benzo(a)pyrene-equivalent toxicity of the PM generated from the AR rice husk being lower than the dried counterpart.

AB Gaussian plume models have been used to estimate pollutant distribution for decades. In view of the empirically determined dispersion coefficients (largely based on atmospheric stability), their application in urban setting needs to be interpreted cautiously. It is even more complicated if chemically reactive pollutants are considered. In this technical note, we examine the reactive plume dispersion over schematic urban areas in attempt to excel the functionality of the conventional Gaussian plume models. Open-channel flows over an array of identical ribs in crossflows serve the theoretical platforms of atmospheric surface layer (ASL) over buildings. The irreversible ozone O-3 titration oxidizes nitric oxide to nitrogen dioxide NO2, representing the typical anthropogenic air pollution chemistry. Large-eddy simulation (LES) is employed to calculate the flows and pollution physics/ chemistry coupling around/over the explicitly resolved roughness elements. The LES results show that, unlike the (larger) mesoscale ones, the conventional approach of modifying dispersion coefficients in terms of the timescales of pollution physics/chemistry is inapplicable due to inhomogeneous vertical mixing. We thus switch to the source depletion analogy which, however, estimates well the concentrations only above the plume rise mean height. A noticeable discrepancy is caused by the dominated oxidation in the near-wall region. Finally, the regression of LES output shows that the vertical dimensionless concentrations exhibit the Gamma gamma-distribution for a range of background O-3 concentrations, unveiling a new, primitive parameterization of reactive plume dispersion over urban areas.

AB The rapid development of industrialization and urbanization has led to haze in Beijing that has garnered world attention. For the first time, we studied the luminescence properties of individual haze aerosol particles by using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) coupled with a cathodoluminescence (CL) spectrometer. CL analysis has rarely been reported for haze particles, however, we found that many haze particles showed varied luminescence characteristics. Many types of mineral dusts showed strong CL emission in the visible light wavelengths. Nitrogen-rich secondary particles had a strong CL emission in the UV wavelengths. Anthropogenic particles such as fly ash and Fe-rich, Ti-rich, and carbonaceous materials had much weaker CL responses. The mixture of mineral dusts and other species showed lower CL intensity and widened CL spectra, which continuously covered the UV-VIS-IR portion of the spectrum and which contrasted with the CL emissions of original mineral dusts and pure secondary salts. The sensitivity of CL spectra with respect to tiny changes in components, impurity, and valences enabled the CL spectroscopy to provide a unique perspective with which to analyze highly complicated mixtures of haze particles.

AB The monitoring information provided by air quality monitoring networks (AQMNs) supports air quality assessment and improvement planning in urban environments. The existence of redundant monitoring stations in an AQMN not only determines the cost of pollution monitoring, but also determines the integrity of pollution information monitoring and the accuracy of air quality assessment. In this study, we developed a method of identifying redundant monitoring stations using a combination of correlation analysis, principal components analysis, an assignment method, the cluster analysis, and correspondence analysis. We used (i) correlation analysis to determine whether the pollution information captured by a monitoring station was correlated with that of other stations, so as to determine whether the AQMN had redundant monitoring stations; (ii) principal components analysis to classify the pollution information and initially identify potentially redundant monitoring stations using the assignment method; and (iii) cluster analysis to identify alternative combinations of redundant monitoring stations. Finally, we verified the alternative combinations by means of a correspondence analysis to determine the final stations which were redundant. We used data on six pollutants (particulates smaller than 2.5 mu m (PM2.5), 10 mu m (PM10) in diameter, sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O-3), and carbon monoxide (CO)) at 13 environmental monitoring stations in Xi'an city, China, in 2016. The analysis identified three redundant stations (Xiao Zhai, Guang Yun Tan, and the Hi-Tech West Zone), and alternatives for each of the redundant stations. Therefore, the method described in this paper can effectively optimize the layout of an AQMN, thereby improving the integrity of the monitoring information and decreasing the cost.

AB Since the Reform and Opening up in China, aerosols increasingly affect the country's climate change and human health. However, remote sensing studies have been inconclusive as to long-term trends in Chinese aerosol emissions. The newly-released MERRA-2 product provides a long-term (1980 onward) aerosol reanalysis dataset, and thus is used in this study for identifying trends in aerosol optical depth (AOD) and aerosol direct radiative effect (ADRE) in clear sky over the Yangtze River Basin (YRB) based on the MK nonparametric method. Results reveal that there is a notable turning point in AOD trends around 2008, i.e., significantly increasing by 0.0201 year(-1) before 2008 and then deceasing by -0.0185 year(-1). The reason may be the decreases of SO2, NOx and soot (dust) emissions from major cities in the YRB since 2006. Likewise, the cooling (warming) effects at the top of atmosphere (TOA), surface (SFC) and atmosphere (ATM) strongly increase by -0.3744 and -0.5652 (0.2935) wm(-2) year(-1) before 2008, and then significantly decrease by 0.2731 and 0.5868 (-0.3145) wm(-2) year(-1). Trend analyses confirm that changes in AOD dominate ADRE trends. Furthermore, AOD is significantly negatively (positively) associated with NDVI and precipitation (GDP and Population density) over most areas of the YRB. Besides, similar spatial trends with AOD are also identified in GDP and NDVI. This indicates that increases in GDP and decreases in NDVI caused by rapid urbanization partly lead to the growth of AOD over the middle and lower reaches of the YRB. However, changes in precipitation and Population density alone may not be the main factors for the increasing AOD.

AB The intake fraction (iF) expresses population exposure resulting from pollutant emissions. City-wide iFs estimated using simple one-compartment models, which have been used in a number of previous studies, have significant uncertainties and do not capture the intra-urban variation in exposure that is important for estimating health effects associated with traffic-related air pollutants. We present a novel and efficient approach for developing spatially-resolved iF estimates using dispersion modeling for near-road exposures that accounts for the spatial and temporal variation in meteorology, emissions and the population living and working near major roads. Using the new approach, iF estimates are developed for emissions of traffic-related fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in Lisbon, Portugal, and compared to estimates from a one-compartment model. Both methods use local meteorological and population data and represent exposures for a total of 2.8 million people. The new method produces an overall iF value of 16.4 ppm for the Lisbon metropolitan area, over twice that of the one-compartment model (8.1 ppm). Most of the exposure (12.0 ppm) occurs for the subset of the population (1.0 million people) living or working within 500 m of highways and major arterials. The iF for the remainder of the population (1.8 million people) is only 4.3 ppm. The spatially-resolved iF estimate accounts for high concentration areas, which can be densely populated, and accounts for much or most of the exposure from traffic-related emissions. The new method is computationally efficient and can improve estimates of exposure and health impacts occurring in urban areas, leading to more effective urban and transportation planning decisions to mitigate impacts.

AB This study presents a reanalysis of ozone (O-3) exposure experiments performed on deciduous broadleaf oak species in the Mediterranean region and a proposal of critical levels to improve the O-3 risk assessment in this area for these widely distributed forest species. Two experiments performed in Spain and Italy were considered, and the following 3 oak species were studied: Quercus pyrenaica, Q. faginea and Q. robur. All the experiments were performed with irrigated potted seedlings growing in Open-Top Chambers exposed to different O-3 levels (with charcoal-filtered air as the control treatment) for two consecutive growing seasons. The Phytotoxic Ozone Dose above an instantaneous threshold of 1 nmol O-3 m(-2) s(-1) (POD1) was calculated by applying a Jarvis type model for the estimation of the stomatal conductance (g(s),), and by adopting a big-leaf resistive scheme to account for the O-3 deposition on the vegetation. Two parameterisations were used for the g, multiplicative model: one species-specific based on the "local" g(s) measurements performed during each experiment, and the other "generic" based on the "Deciduous Mediterranean broadleaf" parameterisation described in the Manual on Methodologies and Criteria for Mapping Critical Loads and Levels and Air Pollution Effects, Risks and Trends of the UN/ECE (CLRTAP, 2015). The two different parameterisations were used to derive dose-response functions and ozone critical levels for the biomass loss of the deciduous oak species. The dose-response functions for roots and total biomass were statistically significant, with both the parameterisations tested (p < 0.05). The O-3 critical levels obtained indicate that deciduous broadleaf oaks in Mediterranean environment could be more tolerant to O-3 than other European broadleaf species and that O-3 is more harmful to the below-ground biomass of the plants rather than the above-ground biomass.

AB The present study is based on hourly aerosol particle and ancillary data taken at three stations in Northeastern Germany 150-200 km apart in the years 2009 through 2015 in order to investigate systematic process related differences that might show up when connecting their data with forward and backward air mass trajectories. The analysis of changes in the atmospheric aerosol during air mass transport between the stations focused on two low-pollution-to-high-pollution pathways of similar distance around 200 km. Despite rather different initial size distributions the increases in total concentration of particle number, volume, and black carbon agreed within 15%, Systematic variations were found in the different concentration increases as a function of time of day at which an interstation air mass transport took place that could be explained with related source and transport processes.
   With Radar-based precipitation data at the stations and along connecting trajectories sub-cloud particle scavenging was investigated. At each station sub-cloud particle scavenging coefficients were determined as a function of particle size between 10 and 700 nm diameter, and as a function of precipitation sums. Median particle scavenging coefficients taken over the central part of the size range of the study strongly increased between 0.2 and 1 mm of precipitation and then planed out towards higher precipitation values. With the particle scavenging coefficients determined at the individual stations and precipitation data along connecting trajectories the sub-cloud particle scavenging analysis was extended to wet scavenging along the transport paths yielding median sub-cloud scavenging ratios over the range 0.2-25 mm of precipitation sums with a non-linear shape similar to that of the median particle scavenging coefficients at the individual stations. Whereas in light precipitation more than 80% of the initial particles in the considered range survived 150-200 km of transport, more than 50% was scavenged by more than 15 mm of precipitation during aerosol transport.

AB Aerosol fluxes were measured by eddy-correlation for 8 weeks of the summer and fall of 2011 above a temperate broadleaf forest in central Ontario, Canada. These size-resolved measurements apply to particles with optical diameters between 50 and 500 nm and are the first ones reported above a temperate deciduous forest. The particle spectrometer was located on top of the flux tower in order to reduce signal dampening in the tube and thus maximize measurement efficiency. The 8-week data set extends into autumn, capturing leaf senescence and loss, offering a rare opportunity to investigate the influence of leaf area index on particle transfer. A distinct pattern of emission and deposition that depends on the particle size is highlighted: while the smallest particles (d(p) < 100 nm) are preferentially emitted (55% of the time), the largest particles (d(p) > 100 nm) are preferentially deposited (62% of the time). For the size bins with detection efficiency above 50% (68-292 nm), the median transfer velocity for each bin varies between +1.34 and -2.69 mm s(-1) and is equal to -0.21 mm s(-1) for the total particle count. The occurrence of the upward fluxes shows a marked diurnal pattern. Possible explanations for these upward fluxes are proposed. The measurements, and their comparison with an existing model, highlight some of the key drivers of the particle transfer onto a broadleaf forest: particle size, friction velocity, leaf area index and atmospheric stability.

AB Despite the widely accepted implications of particulate matter on urban air quality, the knowledge of directly measured real-world emissions of particles from urban areas is highly uncertain. During the Innsbruck Air Quality Study (INNAQS), size-resolved particle number concentrations and fluxes for particles with diameters between 6 nm and 0.64 mu m diameter were measured together with CO2, NOx and selective non-methane volatile organic tracers. With this unique dataset, exchange fluxes of eight different particle size bins were studied in relation to urban gas phase tracers. Particle number fluxes were almost completely dominated by ultrafine particles with diameters < 0.1 mu m of which 50% were smaller than 50 nm. Correlation analysis reveals that urban particles shared common sources with NOx, benzene, and CO2, which, based on footprint analysis, can mostly be attributed to traffic. Fluxes of particles with diameters between 0.03 mu m and 0.1 mu m were mostly positive and showed the best correlations with traffic and traffic associated tracer fluxes. Fluxes in the few-nanometer size-range showed more variability, which was caused by bidirectional flux patterns. Fluxes of particles larger than 0.25 mu m correlated only poorly with traffic-related emissions. This manuscript demonstrates size-specific variability and bi-directionality in particle exchange and provides size-specific particle emission factors for traffic related tracers from the urban area of Innsbruck.

AB Air quality in the city of Innsbruck, Austria, is affected by transalpine traffic and mountainous terrain, which is characterized by a pronounced mountain - valley wind system often favouring high pollution levels. To contribute to a better understanding of urban air pollution mechanisms in an Alpine valley, eddy covariance (EC) measurements with a condensation particle counter (CPC) were performed at an urban site in Innsbruck in the framework of the Innsbruck Air Quality Study (INNAQS). Emission fluxes of 10.6.10(7) m(-2) s(-1) (median) were observed during daytime and up-valley flow, whereas fluxes during reversal periods of the valley wind system were more variable and partly negative.
   Sporadic gust-like motions of vertical wind and concurrently measured large changes in particle number concentration (termed particle gusts) significantly biased total particle fluxes, reflecting, however, rather local fluxes at the measurement height. The particle gust events were identified by applying the median absolute deviation (MAD) method to particle fluxes. The particle flux was reconstructed by means of a continuous wavelet transform (CWT) to confirm the validity of the EC calculations during particle gusts. Their origin could not clearly be identified, but they indicate the presence of poorly mixed air parcels which are strongly enriched with particles. Due to the episodic yet large contribution to particle fluxes in Innsbruck, the potential impact of particle gusts on turbulent particle exchange should also be evaluated at other urban and non-urban sites.

AB In urban areas with high air pollution emissions, the boundary layer volume within which gases and particles are diluted is critical to air quality impacts. With advances in ground-based remote sensing technologies and data processing algorithms, observations of layers forming the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) are becoming increasingly available at high temporal resolution. Here, mixing height (MH) estimates determined from turbulence measurements of Doppler lidars and aerosol-derived mixed layer height (MLH) based on automatic lidar and ceilometer (ALC) observations within the centre of London are assessed. While MH uncertainty increases with shorter duration of vertical stare sampling within the Doppler lidar scan pattern, instrument-related noise of the ALC may result in large MLH errors due to the challenging task of layer attribution. However, when long time series are assessed most of the algorithm- and instrument-related uncertainties average out and therefore become less critical to overall climatological analyses. Systematic differences occur in nocturnal MH from two nearby (3-4 km) sites but MLH estimates at both sites generally agree with MH obtained at the denser urban setting. During daytime, most spatial variations in ABL structure induced by synoptic conditions or land cover heterogeneity at this scale do not exceed measurement uncertainty. Agreement between MH and MLH is clearly affected by ABL aerosol content and cloud conditions. Discrepancies increase with cloud complexity. On average, MH rises ahead of MLH during the morning growth period and peaks earlier in the day. There is a faster afternoon decay of MLH so that MLH and MH converge again around sunset and often have similar nocturnal values. Results demonstrate that turbulence-derived MH and aerosol-derived MLH should not be used interchangeably for purposes of model evaluation, interpretation of surface air quality observations or initialisation of chemical transport models.

AB Reactions between ammonia (NH3) and organic compounds containing carbonyl functional groups in aerosol particles can form organic products that are less basic than NH3 and are thus unable to neutralize efficiently nitric and sulfuric acids. In this exploratory study, the University of California, Irvine - California Institute of Technology (UCI-CIT) model is used to investigate the potential air quality impacts of including of the chemical uptake of NH3 by secondary organic aerosols (SOA) in a regional airshed model. A surface reaction of NH3 with SOA is implemented into the model to determine the impact of this process on NH3 and PM2.5 concentrations in the South Coast Air Basin of California (SoCAB). Air quality simulations are conducted using uptake coefficients ranging from 10(-5) to 10(-2) to explore the sensitivity of changes in NH3 and PM2.5 concentrations to the magnitude of the uptake coefficient. Results indicate that the chemical uptake of NH3 by SOA can potentially deplete gaseous NH(3 )concentrations, causing indirect reductions in the amount of ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulfate in particulate matter. The magnitude of the impact on NH3 and PM(2.5 )concentrations exhibits a strong but non-linear dependence on the value of the uptake coefficient, with evidence for small but notable impacts on air quality even with the lowest assumed uptake coefficient of 10(-5).

AB Fine urban aerosol particles with aerodynamic equivalent dimeter <= 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) were collected in Mainz (a city within the Rhine-Main area, the third largest metropolitan region in Germany) and Beijing (Chinese megacity). A solvent mixture of acetonitrile-water was used to extract the organic aerosol fraction (OA) from the particle samples. The extracts were analyzed by an ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometer (UHRMS) Orbitrap coupled with ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) both in the negative and positive ion mode. The number of compounds observed in Beijing is a factor of 2-10 higher compared to Mainz. The clear differences on chemical composition of OA in the two cities were observed. The majority of organics in Beijing OA is characterized by lower elemental H/C and O/C ratio but a higher degree of unsaturation and a larger aromaticity equivalent (X-c) compared to Mainz OA, suggesting that aromatics, which are related to direct combustion compounds (e.g., oxidized polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)), play an important role for OA in Beijing. A significant number of organosulfates (OSs) with long-carbon chain and low degree of unsaturation were observed in Beijing OA, indicating that long-chain alkanes emitted by vehicle might be their precursors.

AB Background & aim: Unconventional natural gas (UNG) extraction activities have considerable potential to affect air quality. However, there are few published quantitative observations of the magnitude of such impacts. To provide context, we compared measured exposures to diesel engine exhaust close to industrial fracking equipment at an UNG training simulation site in Lowicz, Poland to pedestrian exposures to traffic-related air pollution in the city centre of Glasgow, UK.
   Methods: We made mobile and static measurements at varying distances from sources in both of the above locations with a portable aethalometer (Aethlabs AE51) for black carbon (BC) and portable monitors (Aeroqual Series-500) for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O-3). Duplicate BC measurements were compared with NO2 observations, after correction of the NO2 sensor response for O-3 interference effects.
   Results: Duplicate BC instruments provided similar real-time measurements (r = 0.92), which in turn were relatively highly correlated with NO2 observations at 5-min temporal resolution at the UNG experimental site (r = 0.75) and on the walking route in Glasgow city centre (r = 0.64) suggesting common diesel sources for NO2 and BC in both locations. Average BC and NO2 concentrations measured approximately 10 m downwind of diesel fracking pumps were 11 and 113 mu g/m(3) respectively. These concentrations were approximately 37 times and 4 times higher than upwind background BC and NO2 concentrations at the site; and approximately 3 times higher than average BC and NO2 concentrations measured in traffic influenced areas in Glasgow.
   Conclusions: Marked elevations of BC and NO2 concentrations were observed in downwind proximity to industrial fracking equipment and traffic sources. This suggests that exposure to diesel engine exhaust emissions from fracking equipment may present a significant risk to people working on UNG sites over extended time.

AB Ammonia emissions play an important role in the formation of secondary inorganic aerosols. Road traffic is considered to be one of the main sources of ammonia in urban environments, although other sources have been identified. An experimental study was carried out in a suburban area of Madrid (Spain), in which high time resolution measurements of ammonia concentrations were obtained using Cavity-Enhanced Laser Absorption Spectroscopy. Mean hourly ammonia concentration during the study period of December 2014 to January 2015 was 2.17 +/- 1.70 mu g m(-3), with 9.3 mu gm(-3) being the maximum recorded value for a period of 10 min. Stagnant conditions dominated the measurement period and influenced the observed concentrations. Other gaseous and particulate matter parameters, including size-segregated mass concentration, particle number size distribution and aerosol chemical composition (non-refractory species) were monitored at the same site in order to support the data interpretation. No relationships with traffic-related pollutants were found, however, a nearby waste-water treatment plant was identified as the main source affecting the observed ambient concentrations of ammonia and aerosols. Ammonia emissions from wastewater treatment plants may be significant annual sources of ammonia in urban environments. High-resolution observations of air chemistry help to resolve emission inventories in urban environments, and improve the effectiveness of policy to reduce secondary inorganic aerosols.

AB A compact laser-based absorption sensor system associated with a 152-m path length absorption cell for simultaneous second harmonic (2f) detection of atmospheric nitrous oxide (N2O), methane (CH4), and water vapor (H2O) is presented. An 8 mu m external cavity quantum cascade laser (EC-QCL) was used as an excitation source to simultaneously target three neighboring absorption lines, N2O at 1255.424 cm(-1) , CH4 at 1255.000 cm(-1), and H2O at 1254.732 cm(-1) . Minimum detection limits (1 sigma) of 0.9 ppb for N2O, 4.8 ppb for CH4 and 31 ppm for H2O were achieved with a 1.s integration time at an optimum pressure of 50 Torr. Both laboratory and atmospheric environmental mixing ratios of these three gases associated with basic meteorological parameters were recorded and the corresponding emission sources were analyzed. In particular, the N2O emission was studied during extended time periods including rainy intervals.

AB Severe hazes occurred during 2016-2017 winter manifested winter haze was still a tough challenge in Beijing since the unprecedented haze in January 2013. Three haze episodes were identified from December 15, 2016 to January 15, 2017 in Beijing: the Red-Alert episode, the mixed haze-dust episode and the longest and heaviest Cross 2017 New Year's Haze episode. We analyzed the chemical components (water-soluble inorganic ions, carbonaceous components and trace elements) of multi-size airborne particles (PM1, PM2.5, PM10) samples, as well as the associated gaseous pollutants and meteorological parameters. Compared with the well-documented severe haze in January 2013, 2016-2017 winter haze was characterized by more stagnant synoptic conditions, sustained accumulation growth of PM enhanced by secondary reactions and regional contribution, as well as prominent fine particles mainly constituted by high concentrations of carbonaceous aerosol, secondary inorganic ions and anthropogenic elements. With strict pollution control measures since the enacting of Clean Air Action Plan in 2013, ambient concentrations of SO2 , as well as SO42- and most anthropogenic elements in PM2.5 have decreased, whereas NO3- and NH4+ concentration in PM2.5 increased by as high as 77.9% and 47.3% respectively compared with January 2013. The ratios of NO3-/SO42- in PM1, PM2.5, PM10 were higher than 1.0 no matter during normal period or haze period, totally different with the results in January 2013, which suggested the increased relative contribution from mobile sources and decreased contribution from coal combustion in Beijing. Nitrate and its precursors had become major concerns during winter haze in Beijing, although the rapid growth of sulfate still played an important role in the formation and evolution of extremely heavy haze events. Under ammonium-rich and high relative humidity conditions, NO3- was thought to mainly be produced by enhanced heterogeneous reactions. To prevent Beijing winter haze effectively, it's quite crucial to cut NOx, NH3 , SO2 and VOCs. emissions simultaneously and strengthen regional cooperation on air pollution control.

AB An intensive measurement campaign was conducted at a rural site in Northwest China to investigate aerosol optical absorption properties, using the ground-based mobile facility of the Semi-Arid Climate and Environment Observatory of Lanzhou University (SACOL). The average mass concentration of PM2.5 was 103 +/- 4 mu g m(-3) during the 20-day campaign in April 2014. Black carbon (BC) only accounted for similar to 0.4% of the PM2.5 on average, with the mean concentration of 443 +/- 12 ng m(-3) measured using a single particle soot photometer (SP2). The aerosol absorption coefficient (sigma(ap)) was 5.69 +/- 0.01 Mm(-1) on average, recorded by a multi-angle absorption photometer (S) at the wavelength of 637 nm. It showed a linear relationship with BC mass concentration during non-dust periods, especially at their diurnal peaks of 07:00-09:00 a.m. (local standard time), deriving a bulk mass absorption efficiency (MAE) for BC of 8.5 +/- 1.1 m(2) g(-1) . The sigma(ap) increased sharply during the dust storm, while the BC remained at a lower concentration than other moments, implying that the dust particles had a considerable contribution to light absorption. On average, dust particles accounted for 26.7% of the aerosol absorption and increased to 71.6% during the dust storm. The MAE of dust was calculated to be 0.014 +/- 0.00028 m(2) g(-1) , which was comparable to that measured in the downwind regions in East Asia. Based on the Mie theory for spherical particles, the refractive index (m) of natural mineral dust particles was estimated to be 1.50-0.0007i in Northwest China.

AB A framework to describe transport and deposition of ultrafine particles (UFP) within forests using large eddy simulation (LES) is presented. Comparison with measurements collected within and above a Scots pine stand in Southern Finland are used to explore the plausibility of the simulations. The numerical model is then employed to quantify the effects of canopy morphology (leaf area index and leaf area density), turbulence intensity, and particle size on the partitioning between upper canopy and subcanopy deposition and the overall deposition velocities. Results show a complex interplay between canopy morphology and turbulence, which is reflected on the particle flux profiles within the canopy. However, mean particle concentration profiles, total deposition, and deposition velocities at the canopy top are insensitive to the leaf area density profile but show dependence mostly on leaf area index, turbulence levels, and particle size. Finally, with the goal of understanding the sensitivity of the deposition velocity to all these parameters, an analytical model is developed that shows good agreement with LES results (within +/- 20%) for all conditions simulated here.

AB Recently, rising concentrations of PM emitted by biomass burning for residential heating purposes have been observed at sites throughout Europe. They are contributing to exceedances of the PM 10 daily limit value and have been shown at some sites to even outrun PM reductions achieved by mitigation strategies focussing on traffic emissions.
   To assess the contribution of fossil and biogenic carbonaceous matter to PM10 mass we measured equivalent black carbon (eBC) by 7-wavelength Aethalometer, elemental and organic carbon (EC/OC) via thermo-optical analysis and levoglucosan by ion chromatography at two monitoring sites (one urban background and one traffic site) in the Ruhr area, Germany, over a period of 16 months (September 2013-December 2014).
   To achieve differentiation between concentrations of carbonaceous particulate matter (CM) emitted by fossil fuel combustion (CMfossil) and CM concentrations attributed to biomass burning (CMbiomass) the so-called "Aethalometer approach" (Sandradewi et al., 2008) mainly based on eBC measurements was applied. Another approach based on levoglucosan as a mono-tracer for biomass burning emissions was used for evaluation of the Aethalometer approach resulting in well correlated concentrations for both approaches within the heating period (r(2) of 0.78 and 0.84, slope of 0.70 and 0.82 for urban background and traffic site, respectively). This confirms the general applicability of both methods. However, sensitivity studies regarding differing fixed factors applied in both approaches for converting eBC or levoglucosan to CM, respectively, showed that slight variation in pre-defined constants could result in CM bias by up to approximately 50%. As a consequence well-considered choice of these conversion factors is considered as crucial to warrant credibility of different CM values.
   Concentrations of CMfossil were found to be almost constant during the whole period whereas biomass emissions exhibited significant seasonal variability, leading to heating period/summer ratios of 2.82 and 2.51 at the urban background and traffic site, respectively. During the heating period concentrations of CMbiomass summed up to 2.8 mu g/m(3) (14.6% of PM10) at the urban background site compared to 2.2 mu g/m(3) (11.2% of PM10) at the traffic site - being in good agreement with those determined for other European sites. The PM10 share of CM(biomass )was almost equal to CMfossil at the traffic site whilst at the urban background site contributions of fossil fuel emissions were even outrun during the colder months. Additionally, data from those two sites observed during the study indicate that emissions from biomass burning processes might be of similar relevance as fossil fuel emissions in terms of exceedances of the daily PM10 limit value.

AB To study air pollution and chemical transformation in North China, annual and seasonal variations of the concentrations of atmospheric constituents were analyzed for four representative sites in three different types of regions (two agricultural, Beijing and surroundings, atmospheric background) in North China during 2005-2015. Satellite-derived vertical column densities (VCDs) of NO2, SO2, O-3, HCHO, and aerosol optical depth (AOD) over the four sites were used together with ground-based radiation and meteorological measurements at each site and, at one of them (Xinglong), ground-based observations of NO2, SO2, O-3 and PM2.5 concentrations. The temporal variations of UV loss in the atmosphere and VCDs of NO2, SO2, O-3 and HCHO were investigated together with the relations between these. Based on the analysis, a photochemical link relating the production of PM2.5 and O-3 in North China was proposed and confirmed. In particular the role of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in chemical and photochemical reactions is found to be prominent in the summer. Suggestions for air pollution control in North China are given, e.g., to reduce anthropogenic VOC emissions and to prevent artificial enhancements of biogenic VOC emissions.

AB We examined the correlations between winter aerosol optical depth (AOD) in North China (NC) and three synoptic-scale meteorological indices from 2001 to 2016, including the Siberian High intensity (SHI), East Asian Winter Monsoon intensity (EAWMI), and the Siberian High Position index (SHPI). To separate the influences from meteorology and emissions, NC AOD was detrended by subtracting a linear increasing trend from 2001 to 2013 and a decreasing trend from 2014 to 2016, in correspondence with reported changes in Chinese anthropogenic emissions during the same period. The SHPI explains 37% of the variability in the detrended NC AOD and 83% of the high SHPI winters correspond to high AOD. By contrast, the SHI and EAWMI show little correlation with the observed AOD variability. To project the SHPI in the future climate, we used the ensemble of six global circulation models (GCMs) which were found capable of reproducing the climatic spatial distribution and the longitudinal variability of the Siberian High from 1956 to 2005. The ensemble results show that the frequency of high SHPI winters and consequently more polluted conditions would increase by 29%, 61%, and 100% under RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 until 2099. There are 11 out of the 25 GCMs examined here that project the possibility of high SHPI conditions to increase under RCP8.5. This indicates changes in the Siberian High position induced by increasing global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions can lead to more winter pollution in North China in the future.

AB Organosulfur compounds are being of increasing interest in the atmospheric environment and climate because of their profound impacts on the formation of secondary organic aerosoL However, their role in the initial step of new particle formation (NPF) is still unclear. Here, using Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculation combined with the Atmospheric Clusters Dynamic Code (ACDC) model, we study the enhancement effect of hydroxymethanesulfonic acid (HMSA) - one of the most important organosulfur compounds - on sulfuric acid (SA) - dimethylamine (DMA) molecular clustering and the underlying mechanism. The results show that HMSA can enhance cluster formation rates at room temperature with the enhancement strength ranging from zero to four orders of magnitude. The comparison of the enhancement effect between HMSA and MSA shows that the enhancement strength of HMSA could be up to 3.97 times stronger than that of MSA, indicating that HMSA may be a more potential stabilizer. Meanwhile, different from the "bridge" role of alpha-hydroxyl acids, HMSA acts as "stabilizer" directly participating in NPF. Both of its enhancement strength on cluster formation rate and the corresponding contribution to the growth pathway present a negative dependence on SA concentration. All those could, to some extent, help to explain the missing sources of NPF between field observation and currently cognition, as well as to assist us to better understand atmospheric organosulfur chemistry.

AB In this study, we examine the oxidative potential of airborne particulate matter (PM) in Beirut, Lebanon, as influenced by dust events originating in the Sahara and Arabian deserts. Segregated fine (< 2.5 mu m) and coarse (2.5-10 mu m) PM samples collected during dust events, as well as during non-dust periods, were analyzed for chemical composition, and the in vitro alveolar macrophage (AM) assay was utilized to determine the oxidative potential of both types of samples. We performed Spearman rank-order correlation analysis between individual chemical components and the oxidative potential of PM to examine the impact of the changes in PM chemical composition due to the occurrence of dust events on overall PM oxidative potential. Our findings revealed that the oxidative potential of Beirut's urban PM during non-dust periods was much higher than during dust episodes for fine PM. Our findings also indicated that tracers of tailpipe emissions (i.e., elemental (EC) and organic carbon (OC)), non-tailpipe emissions (i.e., heavy metals including Cu, Zn, As, Cd, and Pb), and secondary organic aerosols (SOA) (i.e., water-soluble organic carbon, WSOC) were significantly associated with the oxidative potential of PM during dust days and non-dust periods. However, the contribution of desert dust aerosols to Beirut's indigenous PM composition did not exacerbate its oxidative potential, as indicated by the negative correlations between the oxidative potential of PM and the concentrations of crustal elements that were enriched during the dust days. This suggests that aerosols generated during Saharan and Arabian dust events pose no additional health risk to the population due to PM-triggered reactive oxygen species formation. These results significantly contribute to our understanding of the effects of desert dust aerosols on the composition and oxidative potential of PM in several countries throughout the entire Middle East region that are impacted by dust events in the Sahara and Arabian deserts.

AB Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) are important pollution gases which can affect air quality, human health and even climate change. Based on the combination of tropospheric NO2 and SO2 column density products derived from OMI satellite with the ground station observations, this study analyzed the spatial-temporal distribution of NO2 and SO2 amount in Inner Mongolia urban agglomerations. It shows that NO2 increased continually from 2005 to 2011 at a rate of 14.3% per year and then decreased from 2011 to 2016 at a rate of -8.1% per year. SO2 increased from 2005 to 2007 with a rate 9.7% per year. While with a peak value in 2011, SO2 generally showed a decreasing trend of -1.6% per year from 2007 to 2016. With regard to the spatial pattern, the highest levels of NO2 occur in Hohhot and Baotou, followed by Wuhai and Ordos, the least in Bayannur. Compared with NO2, the spatial distribution of SO2 is slightly different. The pollution of SO2 is the most serious in Wuhai, followed by Hohhot and Baotou, and the lightest in Ordos and Bayannur. The diurnal variations of NO2 and SO2 are basically the same, which decrease from 0:00 to 6:00, then increase to a peak value at 8:00, and decrease from 8:00 to 15:00. The diurnal variation of NO2 and SO2 is highly related to the diurnal variation of both anthropogenic emission and boundary layer height. Differently, the long-term spatial temporal distribution of NO2 and SO2 are more closely related to human activities.

AB Atmospheric PM1 has an impact on health and the environment, and is highly variable. PM1 filter samples were collected in urban roof and street sites in two Mediterranean cities in Europe (Barcelona and Madrid) to study the spatial and temporal trends of primary and secondary organic tracer compounds. Both cities are exposed to modern urban emission sources with intensive traffic in their centers. Moreover, their geographical situation in the Mediterranean region favors photo-chemical reactions and accumulation of secondary aerosols, due to sunny anti-cyclonic weather conditions. Barcelona is located along the coast with high relative humidity and an active sea-mountain breeze system, while the relative humidity in Madrid is low in summer, due to its location in the center of the Iberian Peninsula. These differences may influence the accumulation of primary air pollutants and the formation of secondary aerosols. In street site samples, the levels of primary organics, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, hopanes and nicotine, were about two times higher than those collected simultaneously at roof sites. Primary emitted levoglucosan and isomers from biomass burning were observed in higher concentrations in winter in both urban areas, but without significant difference between the road and roof sites samples, indicating regional transport of biomass smoke to the cities. Similar roof and street site sample concentrations were also observed for secondary organic aerosol (SOA) compounds, i.e. dicarboxylic acids and oxidation products of isoprene and alpha-pinene. The SOA compound concentrations were ten times higher in summer compared to winter samples, emphasizing the importance of SOA formation processes in summer. More evidence was obtained that linked the presence of cis-pinonic acid in the filter samples to new particle formation during nucleation. The urban organic PM1 is dominated by SOA, while the primary organic aerosol (POA) tracer compounds from combustion sources, including traffic and biomass burning, dominates in winter.

AB An extended study on the oxidative potential (OP) of PM10 particles collected from December 2014 to October 2015 at a peninsular site of the Central Mediterranean basin has been performed. PM10 particles have been selected to better account for all different aged/fresh particle types. Two acellular assays, i.e., the dithiothreitol (DTT) and ascorbic acid (AA) methods, were used to measure the OP of PM10 particles chemically speciated by more than 40 species.
   DTT and AA assays provide close mean values of volume normalized OPV responses, with similar variability range, i.e., mean OPVDTT = 0.24 +/- 0.12 nmol(DTT) min(-1) m(-3) and mean OPVAA = 0.29 +/- 0.18 nmol(AA) min(-1) m(-3). Also mass normalized OPm responses are similar for both assays, with mean value close to 0.008 nmol min(-1) mu g(-1).
   The measured OPVDTT and OPVAA are correlated with several inorganic species, namely ions and metals, and with organic/elemental carbon. The discrimination of the data according seasonality, i.e., Autumn-Winter (AW, October-March) and Spring-Summer (SS, April-September) days, shows a clear seasonal trend of correlation coefficients. In AW, OPVDTT is strongly correlated with nss-K+ and nss-Ca2+, in addition to Ba, Cd, Ce, Cr, Cu, Fe, and Mn (traffic-related metals) and with EC, OC, and POC associated with the traffic exhaust source and/or with the combustion including biomass-burning source. Otherwise, OPVDTT of SS samples is correlated only with NH4+, Cu, EC, OC, and POC.
   The OPVAA of AW samples is well correlated with Ba, Ce, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, nss-K+, EC, OC, and POC, which are related with traffic and/or combustion emissions. Conversely, in SS, OPVAA is mainly correlated with NH4+, nss-K+, nss-Mg2+, nss-Ca2+, nss-SO42-, Cu, Mn, P, Pb, and oxalate, that are species related to secondary aerosols and resuspended soil from vehicular traffic and/or transported Saharan dust.
   These findings point the importance of both organic components and transition metals to PM oxidative properties, and also suggest that synergistic/antagonistic interactions and cross-correlations between the PM redox-active components are likely responsible for the seasonal variation of the AA and DTT assay response. The inter-correlation among all analysed species has been investigated to explain contrasting results and the negative correlations between OP values and some chemical species.Cell-free methods assessed the oxidative potential of particulate matter collected at a Central Mediterranean Site and the results were correlated with PM10 chemical composition.

AB The spatio-temporal characteristics of aerosol loading over South China from 2001 to 2016 were investigated using aerosol optical depth (AOD) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and NO2 from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (0M1). AOD values were high in the central part and low in the southeast and northwest parts of South China. High AOD (larger than 0.7) were found in the Pearl River Delta, Nanning, and Hanoi (Vietnam). The seasonal average AOD was high in spring (approximately 0.7) and low in winter (approximately 0.4). Generally, an increasing trend of AOD was found from 2001 to 2004 and a decreasing trend from 2004 to 2016 in the continent due to the change in pollutant discharging, which was verified by annual NO2 data. Furthermore, the aerosol radiative effect (ARE) was calculated using the Mesoscale Atmospheric Global Irradiance Code (MAGIC) and MODIS AOD time series. The spatial distribution and temporal variation of ARE at surface showed similar patterns to AOD, with high values occurring in the Pearl River Delta (39 W/m(2)), Hanoi (36 W/m(2)), and Nanning (30 W/m(2)). From 2001 to 2016, ARE at surface in South China decreased by approximately 4 W/m(2) with the highest value (24.75 W/m(2)) occurring in 2007.

AB The contribution of precursor emissions from 17 mobile source sectors to ambient ozone and fine particulate matter levels across the U.S. were evaluated, using the CAMx photochemical model, to identify which mobile source sectors are projected to have the largest impacts on air pollution in 2025. Both onroad and nonroad sectors contribute considerably to projected air pollution across much of the country. Summer ozone season ozone contributions between 2 and 5 ppb, which are among the highest levels presented on the maps of mobile source sectors, are largely found in the southeast United States from the onroad sectors, most notably light-duty and heavy-duty vehicles, and along the coastline from the Category 3 (C3) marine sector. Annual average PM2.5 contributions between 0.5 and 0.9 mu g/m(3), which are among the highest levels presented on the maps of mobile source sectors, are found throughout the Midwest and along portions of the east and west coast from onroad sectors as well as nonroad diesel and rail sectors. Additionally, contributions of precursor emissions to ambient ozone and PM2.5 levels were evaluated to understand the range of impacts from precursors in the various mobile source sectors. For most mobile source sectors, in most locations, NOx emissions contributed more to ozone than VOC emissions, and secondary PM2.5 contributed more to ambient PM2.5 than primary PM2.5. The largest ozone levels on the maps showing contributions from mobile source NOx emissions tended to be between 2 and 5 ppb, while the largest ozone levels on the maps showing contributions from mobile source VOC emissions tended to be between 0.9 and 2 ppb, except for southern California where ozone contributions from VOC emissions from onroad light duty vehicles were between 2 and 5 ppb. The largest contributions to ambient PM2.5 on the maps showing primary and secondary contributions from mobile source sectors tended to be between 0.1 and 0.5 mu g/m(3). The contribution from primary PM2.5 extended over localized areas (urban-scale) and the contribution from secondary PM2.5 extended over more regional (multi-state) areas.

AB The land use and land cover (LULC) change can modulate regional meteorology and consequently influence the air quality. This study incorporates two types of LULC data (representing early 1990s and most recent years respectively) into the Weather Research and Forecasting Model-Community Multiscale Air Quality (WRF-CMAQ) model to investigate the impacts of LULC change on the meteorology and air quality. The LULC change and associated parameters including land cover proportion, land surface albedo, roughness length result in some variations of surface energy balance, surface temperature, planetary boundary layer height (PBLH), surface wind speed and direction, which lead to domain-wide increases of 2-m temperature (T-2) (0.53-0.96 degrees C, 3.6-14.9%), PBLH (3.3-130 m, 3.5-38.3%) and decrease of 10-m wind speed (WS10) (0.12-0.47 m/s, 5.2-15.7%) in the urban. As a result, the concentrations of air pollutants are also affected by LULC change. It leads to a domain- wide decrease of PM2.5 in the urban. The reductions are more obvious during the rush hour in the morning and evening. The impacts of LULC change on O-3 vary in different seasons and cities. In Beijing, O-3 increases by 0.5-4.3 ppb during daytime in July. While in Tianjin, O-3 decreases by up to 3.4 ppb at noon. In summer, the change of O-3 is inversely corresponding to NOx change, which may be associated with the VOC-limited O(3 )chemistry in daytime and NOx titration at night in the urban. In winter, the change of O-3 is mainly related to the reduced radiation which is unfavorable for O-3 formation. Meanwhile, these changes of PM2.5 and O-3 are different under variable levels of air pollution. The largest reduction ratio of PM2.5 occurs at slightly-heavily polluted levels instead of severely polluted level, while the extent of O-3 increase becomes greater along with the aggravation of O-3 pollution.

AB Multi-element reference materials (ME-RMs) mimicking atmospheric aerosol composition were generated using certified multi-element solutions on PTFE filters for use in calibration and quality checks of x-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis. The ME-RMs reference loadings were assigned using an approach based on two assumptions: the accuracy of potassium (K) measured by energy-dispersive XRF (EDXRF) analysis at the University of California-Davis, and no change in the chemical profile of multi-element solutions when deposited on PTFE filters. A subset of ME-RMs was analyzed by EDXRF and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) to check the agreement between the two methods and the reference loadings. Several statistical metrics revealed good agreements for Na, Al, Si, S, K, Ti, V, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Se, As, and Pb. Selected ME-RMs were tested for short-and long-term stability and homogeneity of deposit; they were shown to be homogeneously deposited and, except for Cl and Br, stable when handled and stored properly. The generated ME-RMs have the potential to fill a gap in the currently available XRF quality assurance resources by providing known element loadings in the range of interest for atmospheric aerosol measurements.

AB Quantifying the gas/particle partitioning of organic compounds is of great significance to the understanding of atmospheric aerosol indirect effect. Accurate determination of the hygroscopicities and vapour pressures of semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOC) is of crucial importance in studying their partitioning behaviour into atmospheric aerosol, as the influences on SVOCs evaporation from participation of inorganic species remains unclear. In this study we first present thermodynamic quantitative simulation and tweezed single particle measurement of hygroscopicity and volatility of single aerosol droplets. With thermodynamics simulation of the hygroscopicity, SVOC time dependent evaporation and potential chloride depletion reaction in a single trapped droplet, we illustrate influences from different process towards the trapped droplet. In optical tweezers measurement, the trapped droplet in the aerosol optical tweezers acts as a microcavity, which stimulates the cavity enhanced Raman spectroscopy (CERS) signal. Size and composition of the particle are calculated from Mie fit to the positions of the "whispering gallery mode" in the CERS fingerprint. Hygroscopic behaviours and SVOC saturated vapour pressure can then be extracted from the correlation between the changing droplet radius and solute concentration (derived from experimentally determined real part of refractive index (RI)) with good accuracy and reliability.

SO ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT

DT Article
DE Particulate matter; Cokriging; Chemistry-transport model
AB European Legislation (Directive, 2008/50/EC) requires the Member State to identify the areas where limit or target values are exceeded and to estimate the population exposed to these exceedances. The monitoring network of particulate matter with diameter less than 10 mu s (PM10) and 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) is homogeneous enough in Western Europe to describe accurately their daily spatial distribution. Daily mapping is required to correctly quantify the population exposed to the exceedances. Geostatistical methods are commonly used in Air Quality to interpolate the observations by taking into account the spatial dependencies between the data. The case of particulate matter is specific: in addition to the total PM10 observations, there are, for historical reasons, measurements of the so-called non-volatile fraction of the particles. The non-volatile fraction dataset is corrected and used as an observation of the total PM applied for mapping. It provides therefore a meaningful information on the chemical composition of the particles. Along this line, PM2.5 data, which are a subset of PM10, also bring an important information on the spatial distribution of the PM10, and conversely. This work demonstrates the importance of keeping an information considered as secondary in the monitoring network and how it is possible to improve the estimation of PM concentrations. An additive modelling for PM10 and its subset is used to link the explanatory variables between them and the related cokriging is presented. Maps and scores are shown and confronted to univariate kriging estimations throughout the first three months of 2015 in metropolitan France.

AB In 2015, diesel cars accounted for 41.3% of the total passenger car fleet in Europe. While harmonized emissions limits are implemented at the EU level, on-road emissions of diesel cars have been found to be up to 16 times higher than those measured in test stands. These excess emissions have been estimated to result in increased PM2.5 and ozone exposure causing approximately 5000 premature mortalities per year in Europe. Interventions aimed at mitigating these damages need to take into account the physical and political boundaries in Europe, where emissions from one country may have an impact on neighboring populaces (trans-boundary impacts). To date, the trans-boundary implications of excess NOx emissions in Europe are not understood and only excess NOx emissions have only been studied at the fleet level and for Volkswagen group cars. In this study, a distribution of emission factors is derived from existing on-road measurements for 10 manufacturers, covering 90% of all new vehicle registrations in Europe from 2000 to 2015. These distributions are combined with inventory data and driving behavior to quantify excess emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) in Europe in 2015. To quantify the changes in PM2.5 and ozone concentrations resulting from these emissions, we use a state-of-the-art chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem). Concentration-response functions from the epidemiological literature are applied to estimate the premature mortality outcomes and the number of life-years lost associated with degraded air quality. Uncertainty in the input parameters is propagated through the analysis using a Monte Carlo approach. We find that 70% of the total health impacts from excess NOx are due to trans-boundary emissions. For example, 61% of the impacts in Germany of total excess NOx emissions are caused by emissions released in other countries. These results highlight the need for a coordinated policy response at the European level. In addition, we find that total emissions accounting for country-specific fleet mixes and driving behaviors vary between manufacturers by a factor of 10 and mortality impacts per kilometer driven by a factor of 8. Finally, we find that if all manufacturers reduced emissions of the vehicles currently on the road to those of the best-performing manufacturer in the corresponding Euro standard, approximately 1900 premature deaths per year could be avoided.

AB Traffic emits a considerable amount of aerosol particles in urban areas and has also recently been shown to be a significant source of sub-3 nm particles. In this study, the concentration of sub-3 nm particles, here referred to as nanocluster aerosol (NCA), was continuously measured with 1 s resolution in a busy street canyon in the city of Helsinki, Finland, for a month period in 2017. NCA concentrations were carefully analyzed with respect to the time of day, the wind direction, the condensation sink, the concentration of sub-7 nm particles, the total particle size distribution, and the CO2 concentration, from which the emission factors for the NCA were calculated. The concentration of the NCA seemed to follow a similar trend to that of sub-7 nm particles. Diurnal variation of the NCA concentration divided into weekdays and weekends and sorted according to the wind direction followed the amount traffic. The NCA concentration was at highest when wind was blowing directly from the road, during the rush hours or when the condensation sink calculated from the particle size distributions was low. The NCA concentration was in line with the traffic-related nucleation mode of the size distribution and its diurnal variation, and the NCA fraction comprised a relatively large part of the total particle number concentration. Average emission factors for the NCA and sub-7 nm particles were 9.36.10(14) kg(fuel)(-1), and 2.73.10(15) kg(fuel)(-1), respectively. Diurnal variation of the emission factors showed an increase in the night, which may result from a dependency of the emission factors on traffic composition, temperature, condensation sink or the driving mode of vehicles.

AB Branches and leaves of six prevalent tree species in sub-tropical China (Masson pine, Oleander, Chinese fir, Camphor, Eucalyptus and Phoebe boumei) were burned in a self-designed biomass combustion system to determine the emission characteristics and chemical composition of the particulate matter emitted. The carbonaceous content and water-soluble ions of PM2.5 were analyzed by an Elementar elemental analyzer and ion chromatography in liquid. The results demonstrate that different combustion conditions have significant effects on emission factors, carbonaceous components and water-soluble ion emissions of PM2.5 released from the combustion of branches and leaves. The average emission factor of PM2.5 (EFPM2.5) of leaves in smoldering and flaming stages were 28.61 +/- 4.90 g/kg and 10.91 +/- 3.32 g/kg, respectively, while the average EFPM2.5 of branches in these stages were 21.09 +/- 2.86 g/kg and 9.74 +/- 2.76 g/kg. Compared to flaming, more PM2.5 was emitted during the smoldering stage from both branches and leaves for six different tree species, while leaves released greater PM2.5 than branches, and conifer trees contributed more to PM2.5 emissions than broad-leaved trees. In addition, findings demonstrate that the smoldering stage accelerates the release of OC (organic carbon), while the release of EC (elemental carbon) is promoted by the flaming stage. Findings also demonstrate that the ratio between OC, EC and PM2.5 varies significantly under different combustion conditions. Both tree species and combustion conditions were identified as important influencing factors for the content and emission factors of water-soluble ions in PM2.5. Ten kinds of water-soluble ions were detected in PM2.5, with K+ occupying the highest percentage of emissions content and highest emission factor, followed by Cl- , F- and SO42- . With these findings, this study contributes to further understanding of the impact of forest fires on the atmospheric environment and ecosystem in subtropical China, as well as provides reference for other regions of the world.

AB Aldehyde may occupy an important role in the volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from soil and plant residue. However, aldehyde emission from agricultural soil as well as the effect of straw incorporation is poorly understood. Therefore, a field straw incorporation experiment comprising two treatments, (1) S0 (no straw incorporation) and (2) S1 (incorporation of maize straw at a rate of 9000 kg ha(-1)), was performed in a maize cropping system to characterize the emissions of aldehyde as well as to estimate the effect of straw incorporation on aldehyde emissions. Nine kinds of aldehydes were investigated and three emission dynamic modes were observed during the experiment. Total aldehydes emissions were significantly different (426.8 and 540.2 g ha(-1) for S0 and S1, respectively). Generally speaking, decanal and nonanal had an obvious predominance in both treatments, taking up 33.1% and 29.2% of the total aldehydes emission for S0, and 30.4% and 28.4% for S1, respectively. In addition, the practice of straw incorporation significantly increased the emissions of the 9 kinds of aldehydes by 11.2%-103.3%, and the total aldehydes emission from incorporated straw alone was calculated as 2918.8 ng kg straw(-1) h(-1) . These results showed that straw incorporation substantially influenced the emissions of aldehydes from the agricultural soil. Additionally, a rough comparison indicated that straw in- corporation might not have much advantage over straw open burning in terms of reducing VOC (i.e., aldehyde) emissions. The results also suggested that environmental conditions (i.e., soil temperature, moisture and pH), especially soil pH, played an important role in aldehyde fluxes from the agricultural soil.

AB Methane emission factors (g/GJ) were determined testing residential heating biomass appliances (6-11 kW) under real-world operating conditions. User behavior for manually load appliances was simulated following a loading scheme starting from the cold start conditions, followed by two nominal batches and a final batch either with the nominal load of the appliance or by over loading the firebox (closing the air valves) and lasted until bum out. The results were analyzed both on batch-per-batch basis and for total combustion cycle from cold start to burn out in order to determine the critical situations causing high methane emissions. For comparison two automatic pellet appliances (8-25 kW) were also tested. Emission factors (EFs) for these automatic appliances are more than an order of magnitude lower with respect to batch-working room heaters. For the latter the average EFs ranged from 142 g/GJ to 238 g/GJ and showed both batch-to-batch and inter-appliance variability; however, many of the observed differences were not statistically significant. The results highlighted the importance of the user behavior to avoid high methane emissions. The climate relevance of methane emission levels has been assessed using global warming potential (GWP) taken from the literature, comparing CO(2)equivalent emissions with that of N2O and other near-term climate forcers (CO, NOx, VOC, black carbon) emitted by the same appliances. The results show that the warming impact of CH4 is lower than that of BC and CO (compounds emitted in relevant levels in small appliances burning wood), but is still an important portion of the CO2 avoided for the substitution of fossil fuels with biomass. Although the uncertainties associated with GWP are large and EFs are based on a limited number of appliances and fuel types, the results show that in the short term (i.e., 20-year period) CO(2)eq for all the non-CO2 forcers offset the CO2 benefits of biomass use.

AB Organic aerosols (OAs) account typically for 20-90% of fine particles (PM2.5) in the lower troposphere. They contribute to a wide range of environmental problems, from local issues (e.g., urban haze) to global problems (e.g., climate change). Huge efforts have been dedicated to studying the composition, abundance, spatial and temporal distribution and sources of organic aerosols in China. This review aims to summarize recent studies on characteristics and sources of OAs and assesses the current state of understanding of the organic aerosol pollution in China. The OA constitutes similar to 20-45% of the PM2.5 with an annual mean value of 5.2-44.5 mu g/m(3) at sites across China, which is about five times higher than that reported in North America and Europe. There are thousands of different organic compounds in atmospheric aerosols, but only about 5-10% of them have been identified and quantified. OAs show pronounced spatial variations with much higher concentrations in Northern than Southern China. Seasonally, the highest OA concentrations are observed in the winter, whereas the lowest are in the summer. This is due to higher emission rates from anthropogenic sources (e.g., biomass and coal combustion) and poorer dispersion conditions in the winter. Approximately 60-80% of total OA is apportioned by receptor modeling (such as Chemical Mass Balance, CMB) and tracer-yield method, based on the source profiles of primary organic aerosols (POA) and secondary OA (SOA) derived from local emission sources. A number of OA sources are identified, including motor vehicles, industrial emissions, biomass combustion, food cooking, and coal combustion for POA and anthropogenic and biogenic emissions for SOA. Industrial emissions and motor vehicular exhaust are the dominant sources of organic aerosols in the industrialized areas of Northern China, as well as the Pearl River Delta and Eastern China, whereas in other urban areas, residential coal combustion and motor vehicular exhaust are the dominant sources in winter and summer respectively.

AB This study concerns the oxidations of linalool, a monoterpene alcohol, via both addition of OH radical to unsaturated carbon atoms and H atom abstraction reactions. The molecular entities were optimized at M06-2X/6-311 + + G(d,p) level of theory. To validate the results, the structures were re-optimized at different functional of DFT and ab initio methods like MPW1K and MP2, CCSD(T), G3B3 with same level of theory respectively. On comparing both reaction channels, the OH addition to C1 carbon atom is the favorable reaction pathway, and competes with O-2 oxidation from early literature survey. Expectedly, all level of theories came up with comparable results and predicted that all proposed reactions were exothermic and exergonic. The rate constant calculations show that the addition and abstraction channels are positive and negative temperature dependent respectively. The predicted Wiberg bond indices shows that all the bonds are concerted but not fully synchronized thus; abstraction and addition reactions of LIN are feasible. Further, this study also calculates the life time of LIN with respect to addition reaction is 13.29 min whereas abstraction reaction found a higher life of 23.70 h, which could compete with real time calculations. Overall, OH addition reaction dominates over H abstraction reactions of LIN.

AB Continuous measurements were made of isotopic compositions in atmospheric water vapor (delta(v)) and in atmospheric precipitation (delta(p)) near the surface in the subtropical monsoon region (Changsha, China) from October 2014 to March 2017 to investigate the change characteristics of vapor isotopes and their interactions with precipitation isotopes. On a diurnal time scale, the delta O-18(v) values were more negative in the daytime and more positive at night, and the change in d(v) was reversed during non-rainy days; however, the delta O-18(v) values were more positive in the daytime and more negative at night, and the variation in d(v) was not significant during rainy days. On a seasonal time scale, affected by distinctive moisture sources, the vapor isotopes had obvious seasonal variations, with higher delta(18)O(v )and d(v) values occurring in cold seasons than in warm seasons. There were generally consistent and significant negative linear relationships of d(v) with temperature and absolute humidity, but the linear relationships between delta O-18(v) and meteorological factors were variable on the different time scales, which was closely associated with the local weather conditions on the short time scales from diurnal to intra-seasonal and movements of air masses with distinct thermodynamic properties on seasonal and sometimes intra-seasonal time scales. Although the change trend of daily delta O-18(v) closely approximated that of delta O-18(p) , delta O-18(p) experienced significant relative enrichment compared to delta O-18(v), with an average enrichment of 9.18 parts per thousand. Overall, the isotopic compositions of atmospheric water vapor were in equilibrium with those of precipitation while rainfall events occurred, except for those in the cold season in 2014, and when tracing short-duration weather events, delta O-18(v), provided more details and information related to weather processes than delta O-18(p).

AB Ten years (2008-2017) of Black Carbon (BC) observations obtained using Aethalometer (AE-31) are analyzed to investigate the seasonal trends and temporal variabilities over a tropical site Gadanki (13.5 degrees N, 79.2 degrees E) located in south-east India. Diurnal variations of BC have two peak structures one in the morning (similar to 08 IST) in all seasons and second in the evening (similar to 20 IST) only during the pre-monsoon (March-May). Intra-annual variation in BC indicated February and March months as the bio-mass burning with highest BC mass concentration (3000-5000 ng/m(3)). About 46% of air parcel back trajectories found passing across the in-land regions of southern peninsular India brining transported aerosol to the source location during pre-monsoon. The lowest BC (similar to 1500 ng/m(3)) is noticed during the monsoon months (June-September). The average BC (2200 ng/m(3)) represents observational site as a typical rural site. The inter-annual variability of BC did not show any significant trend. However, trends in the maximum (March) and minimum (July) BC values show statistically significant decreasing trend suggesting reduction in bio-mass burning sources during March supported by the decrease in the fire counts. Diurnal variation in the absorption angstrom exponent indicates that the morning and evening peaks are contributed by the bio-mass combustion with values above threshold of 1. However, angstrom exponent values are found below 1 during noon time of monsoon season suggesting fossil fuel contribution. Strong coupling is found between aerosol concentration and tropospheric dynamics, meteorology in addition to the sources. The present study is expected to provide valuable input to the modelers and observational physicists as BC is climate sensitive variable.

AB Residential indoor exposure to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is a major public health concern. However, the relevant pollution sources have not been well characterized in China. In this study, the 24-h integrated concentrations of 55 VOC species in 27 urban residences, Beijing were measured in the summer. The sources were characterized with positive matrix factorization (PMF) and general linear model (GLM). The most abundant species in terms of geometric mean concentration were formaldehyde (55.1 mu g/m(3)), acetaldehyde (18.7 mu g/m(3)), acetone (14.8 mu g/m(3)), toluene (14.1 mu g/m(3)), hexanal (13.8 mu g/m(3)), n-hexadecane (8.9 mu g/m(3)) and n-pentadecane (8.5 mu g/m(3)). PMF generated 7 factors associated with VOC sources, including aldehydes from ozone-initiated secondary reactions, butyraldehyde from hydrolysis of building materials and furniture, wood flooring emission, wooden furniture emission, wall coverings emission, mobile emission and halogenated hydrocarbons of miscellaneous outdoor origin. GLM identified leather sofa as another source of indoor terpenes and formaldehyde. GLM also found composite wood flooring had stronger emission of VOCs than solid wood flooring, except 1,4-dichlorobenzene. A comparison with multiple studies across the world suggested that: (1) more intensive ozone-initiated secondary reactions resulted in the significantly higher indoor carbonyl concentrations in Beijing than in Japan and USA in the summer; (2) the indoor concentrations of benzene and C-12-C-17 alkanes were much higher in Beijing, due to the traffic conditions and prevalent use of wood flooring varnishing.

AB Mist chambers (MC) have been used for decades to sample water-soluble gases in atmospheric studies. Herein, we characterize the use of a mist chamber for the collection of oxygenated organic gases, with a focus on intermediate solubility compounds to better constrain the transition from low-to-high collection efficiency. The investigated compounds span a range in Henrys law constants (K-H, 2.5 x 10(1) M atm(-1) to 4.1 x 10(5) M atm(-1)) and include moieties abundant in tropospheric gases (carboxylic acids, alcohols, and carbonyls). Under the configuration used here, the MC achieved greater than 90% collection efficiency for compounds with K-H > 4.9 x 10(2) M atm(-1). This represents an improvement over prior MC characterizations, likely due to the increased number of intermediate solubility compounds investigated. We apply the MC collection efficiency to simulations of VOC photooxidation. The results indicate that the MC is likely to collect the majority of gas-phase oxidation products for ten different VOCs, with the highest collection efficiency (94%) predicted for the oxidation products of alpha-pinene under low-NOx conditions.

AB The relationship between ozone and its main precursors exhibits complex non-linear feature in the atmospheric photochemical system. Therefore, sophisticated mathematical and nonlinear methods are very important for studying the O-3 sensitivity to its precursors and improving the O-3 prediction model. In this study, the coupling detrended fluctuation analysis (CDFA) method has been used to investigate the multi-temporal scaling pattern of coupling correlations between O-3 and its precursors. Hourly concentrations of ozone (O-3), nitrogen oxide (NOx) and non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs) from 1 March 2016 to 28 February 2017 of two traffic monitoring sites in Taiwan are analyzed. Coupling multifractality features are confirmed in the temporal distribution of coupling correlations between O-3 and its precursors. And the sources of coupling multifractal features are investigated by the phase randomized surrogates and the shuffling procedures. Moreover, in order to confirm the ozone sensitivity to its precursors at different time scales, a novel dynamical index, namely the coupling sensitivity degree (CSD), is introduced based on CDFA method. High temporal scale resolution of the O-3-NMHCs-NOx sensitivity is presented based on the concept of sliding window. And the O-3-NMHCs-NOx sensitivity regime can be shown visually by the temporal evolutions of the CSD on the whole year. Furthermore, statistics of seasonal CSD values are obtained by averaging the hourly sliding values. Result shows that the CSD values for both NMHCs and NOx are greatest in summer due to the more active photochemical reaction, compared to the other seasons. Meanwhile, the photochemical system is more sensitive to NMHCs for the two sites, which is consistent with the characteristics of pollutant emissions in the urban traffic area. At last, the diurnal pattern of the CSD for NMHCs and NOx are investigated. It is found that the greatest CSD for both NMHCs and NOx series are synchronized to the maximum O-3 generation. This study provides a feasible and effective dynamical index to describe O-3-NOx-NMHCs sensitivity, and suggests a new approach to improve the ozone prediction models in the photochemical system.

AB The importance of the oxidizing capacity of reactive chlorine species, and the heterogeneous reactions of atmospheric pollution gases on the surface of particles has been well established in field observation, modeling simulation and laboratory exploration. However, less is known about the reactions of reactive chlorine on mineral particles. We studied the effect of Cl-2 on the heterogeneous reaction of NO2 with gamma-Al2O3 by using ion chromatography and positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy. The presence of Cl-2 can promote the uptake of NO2 on gamma-Al2O3 at humid conditions. The probable explanations are that Cl-2 rapidly reacts with NO2 on the gamma-Al2O3 surface in the presence of adsorbed water, and nitrites, as the intermediate products during the heterogeneous reaction of NO2 on mineral dust, are immediately oxidized by adsorbed Cl-2. In the positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy experiment, a porous gamma-Al2O3 was demonstrated by the relatively high fourth lifetime intensity. The increase in the number of anions (onto gamma-Al2O3) when the reaction time was prolonged was a direct consequence of the decrease in the o-Ps intensity and the o-Ps lifetime, which illustrated that the heterogeneous reactions might occur on the porous surface of gamma-Al2O3. Our results suggest that the oxidative effect of Cl-2 on the heterogeneous conversion of NO2 to nitrogen-containing particles might have a significant contribution to the fine particle growth and to the unknown sources of nitrate observed in secondary inorganic aerosols.

AB The existence of elevated aerosol layer is common over India during monsoon season. Though its sources are well explained through long-range transport, its formation and maintenance is not explained to date. The formation and maintenances of an elevated aerosol layer, starting from similar to 2 km and extending up to similar to 5.5 km noticed is explained using two nearby lidars located in peninsular India. Existence of a cleaner environment with low aerosol loading below 2 km is attributed to the wet scavenging and existence of no strong local source. The low level jet (LLJ) from Arabian Sea persisting between 2 and 3 km is the main mechanism suggesting strong role of dynamics in the formation of these elevated layers. Persistent strong shears existing between LLJ and tropical easterly jet during this season restrict the up-liftment of aerosols to the higher altitudes. Observed features are explained in the light of dynamics, meteorology and long-range transport.

AB Solar UV radiation reaching the Earths surface is known to have various effects on human health and on the ecosystem. Ground-based measurements of surface UV radiation are spatially sparse and in many cases do not provide long time series. Higher spatial coverage can be provided by measurements from satellite based instruments, but these measurements need to be compared to ground-based measurements of sufficient quality before they can be used in health and ecosystem applications. Here, we compare the measurements of surface solar UV radiation in UVA (315-400 nm) and UVB (280-315 nm) bands with the satellite retrievals (CERES) and validate the latter at an urban location, Delhi, India. We have also used MODIS-retrieved aerosol optical depth (AOD) and cloud optical depth (COD) data to see the effect of atmospheric opacity on UV radiation. Ground based measurements of UVA and UVB were performed from 01 October, 2012 to 30 September, 2015: Correlations between daily surface measurements and CERES-derived surface UV fluxes showed very good agreement (r similar to 0.92-0.93) over Delhi. We found a negative correlation between UV fluxes and AOD over Delhi during all seasons. A unit increase in AOD leads to a decrease of similar to 4-5 Wm(-2) in UVA and similar to 0.09-0.14 Wm(-2) in UVB over Delhi. The trend analysis from monthly mean CERES-derived UV fluxes for 17 years data reveals that UVA and UVB are decreasing similar to 0.07 Wm(-2) yr(-1) and 0.003 Wm(-2) yr(-1), respectively with AOD increase (similar to 0.005 yr(-1)) over Delhi. The simultaneous increase in aerosol loading with decrease in UV fluxes at the surface may be explained as a masking effect of ever increasing pollution on surface UV radiation over Delhi. Our results show similar to 10% and similar to 20% decrease (with respect to mean) in UVA and UVB surface fluxes, respectively during last 17 years.

AB Aerosol size distributions were measured using a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS), and also PM1 (particulate matter <= 1 mu m in aerodynamic diameter) samples were collected in parallel at a representative site in New Delhi during spring in 2013 and 2014. Based on the temporal variation of particle count mean diameter (CMD), sampling periods are characterized as growth events and non-growth events. Particle size distribution measurements suggest that some consecutive nights experienced unique nighttime subsequent growth of particles, which sustained for a longer period. Average particle growth rate measured during growth events was 5.64 +/- 3.03 nm h(-1). Atmospheric trace gas concentrations and meteorological data show that these growth events (nighttime) are influenced by higher concentrations of gases, e.g., NO2 (56.5 +/- 29.7 mu g m(-3)), SO2 (9.34 +/- 1.14 mu g m(-3)) and RH (45.7 +/- 9.5%) than those of non-growth events (daytime) (37.9 +/- 18.6 mu g m(-3), 7.19 +/- 2.08 mu g m(-3) and 37.7 +/- 6.9%, respectively). Further, analysis of PM1 samples collected during the study period shows that the particulate water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) (12.7 +/- 4.1 mu g m(-3)), NH4+ (9.4 +/- 3.2 mu g m(-3)), SO42- (2.03 +/- 0.70 mu g m(-3)), K+ (1.06 +/- 0.40 mu g m(-3)), and NO2- + NO3- (0.59 +/- 0.36 mu g m(-3)) are the major contributors of particulate mass, wherein NH4+, SO42-, K+, NO2- + NO3- mass concentrations were higher during growth events. Correlation study shows that nighttime aerosol composition during growth (in sub-micron range) events are more enriched by inorganic species (i.e., NH4NO3, (NH4)(2)SO4 and H2SO4 vapors) as compared to organics (i.e., WSOC, does not show much difference in growth events and non events). Our results suggest that nighttime sulfate formation at the site is mostly mediated by high NO2 and NH3 at elevated RH. For the formation of sulfate and other inorganic species, a nighttime atmospheric chemistry is proposed, which is linked to particle growth. Growth events observed typically in nighttime have both biomass burning and anthropogenic influences as indicated by high concentrations of WSOC, K+ and black carbon in PM1 and carbon monoxide in gas phase.

AB During the past decades, many authors have studied extreme ozone (O-3) events on successive days in several cities around the world, where extreme pollution concentrations are considered as values exceeding air quality standards. These multiday episodes are caused by different variables: weather conditions, pollution precursors life times and air pollution transport. However, a complete characterization of the temporal behavior of multiday extreme O-3 episodes is still lacking. In the present paper, we used the Haar wavelet transform to study the period (T in days) of multiday extreme O-3 episodes in Mexico city during 2015-2016, when 10 ozone contingencies occurred and changes in driving restrictions were implemented. In addition, we studied the temporal correlations between extreme O-3 and extreme: nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO) and ultraviolet B radiation (UVB) for a broad range of time scales by means of the Haar Wavelet cross-correlation method. The results show that multiday O-3 episodes mainly exhibit periods of T > 4 days, while NO2 and CO show multiday episodes comprising principally periods of T > 2 days. The cross correlation analysis reveals that CO and NO2 are temporal anti-correlated with O-3 for daily variations T < 1. However, NO2 and CO are strongly and moderately correlated with O-3 for T > 4, respectively, indicating that NO2, CO and O-3 are correlated in a multi-temporal clustered form.

TI Future changes in precipitation extremes over China projected by a
   regional climate model ensemble
SO ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT

AB China has experienced frequent extreme precipitation events (i.e., floods and droughts) in recent years, which have resulted in significant economic losses and irrevocable damages to human societies and natural ecosystems. How to adapt to the forthcoming and long-term changes in precipitation extremes has become the top priority of decision makers and resources managers for developing resilient communities and sustainable agroecosystems. This essentially replies on a better understanding of possible changes in the spatiotemporal characteristics of precipitation extremes from both short-term and long-term perspectives. To this end, future changes in precipitation extremes across China in response to global warming are investigated in this study through a regional climate ensemble modeling approach. Specifically, in order to reflect spatiotemporal variations and uncertainties in model physics, a perturbed-physics global climate model ensemble is used to drive the PRECIS regional climate modeling system to generate 25-km climate projections throughout the 21st century for the entire country of China. The validation results for the ensemble simulations over the historical period show that the PRECIS model performs reasonably well in reproducing the spatial patterns of observed precipitation extremes in most regions of China. The future projections of precipitation extremes suggest that there is very likely to be a continuously-increasing trend in the analyzed precipitation extreme indices (except for a slight decreasing trend in CDD). Particularly, higher rates of increase in these indices are expected to occur from the forthcoming decades to the middle of this century. The results also indicate apparent spatial variations in the projected changes of precipitation extremes. In general, absolute changes in northern regions are relatively small compared to the significant changes in southeastern regions, suggesting that more severe floods might be expected in the southeast while slight increases in precipitation in the north (especially the northwest) would lead to a relief to the droughts. However, the percentage changes are larger in north than south. Moreover, it is reported that the frequency and intensity of heavy rains across the country are projected to increase, implying that more frequent urban flooding would become a major challenge for developing resilient and sustainable communities in China. The changes in thermal (i.e., temperature) and dynamical (i.e., circulations) factors could be some physical reasons for the increase of intensity and frequency in future precipitation.

AB A regional air quality model system (RAQMS) was developed by coupling the treatment of heterogeneous reactions between sea salt aerosols (SSAs) and trace gases and applied to the investigation of aerosol properties and evolutionary features in the western Pacific Ocean in the spring of 2014. Model results for meteorological variables, PM concentrations, and size-resolved water soluble inorganic aerosol (WSIA) concentrations were compared and analyzed with a variety of observations from in situ measurements and the research cruise Dongfanghong II. Model validation demonstrated that the model can simulate the spatial-temporal distribution and size distribution of aerosol inorganic components in the marine atmosphere over East Asia, and the inclusion of heterogeneous reactions on SSAs apparently improved the model simulation for WSIA concentration, especially for aerosol size distribution. In the western Pacific Ocean, the non-sea salt SO42- and NO3- formed on SSAs accounted for up to 30% and 90% of surface SO42- and NO3- concentrations on average, respectively. The atmospheric depositions of total inorganic sulfur and nitrogen were estimated to be 13184 x 10(3) kgS/d and 10728 x 10(3) kgN/d, respectively. Wet deposition was the dominant removal pathway, which accounted for 75% and 68% of sulfur and nitrogen depositions, respectively. The deposition of fine-mode SO42- exceeded that of coarse-mode SO42-, whereas the deposition of coarse-mode NO3- was comparable to that of fine-mode NO3-. The non-sea salt SO42- and NO3- formed on SSAs contributed 16% and 9% of total sulfur and nitrogen depositions on average, respectively. The above results revealed the important role of SSAs in both atmospheric chemistry and deposition in the western Pacific Ocean.

AB The study presents the first experimental evidence of the effects of atmospheric particulate matter (PM) deposition on two basmati (scented) rice varieties [Pusa Basmati-1509 (PB-1509) and Pusa Sugandh-5 (PS-5)] grown in Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) of India. Atmospheric PM load at the experimental site during rice crop growth period (August-November) was in the range of 162-660 mu gm(-3). The rice varieties growth, biochemical, physiological and yield attributes were monitored under three levels of PM deposition namely - low levels of PM deposition (LPM), ambient levels of PM deposition (APM) and elevated levels of PM deposition (EPM). PM deposition and PM flux on the canopy of rice varieties were 400-574 mu gcm(-2) and 24-58 mu gcm(-2) day(-1), respectively. PM deposition was 4.5% higher on the PS-5 than PB-1509 and among growth stages; it was the highest during the reproductive growth stage. Significant reduction in chlorophyll, leaf water and carotenoid content were observed in both varieties under EPM compared to APM. The air pollution tolerance index (APTI) also declined significantly. PM deposition enhanced leaf temperature (1-6%) of rice varieties under EPM compared to APM. The reduction in photosynthesis, stomata] conductance and transpiration of rice varieties under EPM were in the range of 9-52%; 6-40% and 8-46%, respectively compared to APM. PM deposition effects on plant height, the number of tillers and recoverable root biomass were found non-significant. PS-5 and PB-1509 exhibited 4-7% enhancement and 7.5-14% reduction in grain yield under LPM and EPM compared to APM, respectively. The results of the study indicate that increasing atmospheric PM pollution in IGP may adversely affect productivity and economic gains from scented basmati varieties of rice.

AB Zinc emission into the atmosphere from residual oil combustion is of significant concern due to its higher concentration, solubility and bioavailability. Exposure to zinc laden residual oil fly ash fine particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter <= 2.5 mu m (ROFA PM(2.)5) induces pulmonary and cardiac effects. These effects are closely linked to the concentration and bonding environment of zinc in ROFA PM2.5. Four ROFA PM2.5 samples were prepared in a 732 kW practical fire tube boiler (FTB) by burning one No. 5 and three No. 6 residual oil(s) of varying sulfur and ash contents. For comparison, one ROFA PM2.5 sample was prepared in a 82 kW small refractory line combustor (RLC) by burning one of the No. 6 oils. The X-ray absorption spectroscopy data of FTB PM2.5 samples reveal that zinc sulfate hydrate (ZnSO4 center dot 7H(2)O) is the dominant zinc form, with the remainder Zn in zinc phosphate hydrate (Zn-3(PO4)(2)center dot 4H(2)O) form. Following dissolution of zinc sulfate from FTB PM2.5, a minor Zn-sorbed ferrihydrite form was detected in the residue. In the RLC PM2.5, zinc phosphate hydrate is predominant. The study shows that zinc solubility is dependent on its speciation, grade and composition of oils, combustion condition, and mode of Zn incorporation into particles carbonaceous matrix. Speciation data provide valuable input to source attribution and health effect studies, and establish a link between the two.

AB Anthropogenic emissions within urban environments are characterized by spatial heterogeneity and temporal variability that present challenges for measuring urban greenhouse gases and air pollutants. To address these challenges, we mounted instruments on public transit light-rail train cars that traverse the metropolitan Salt Lake Valley (SLV) in Utah, USA to observe the temporal and spatial variability of atmospheric species including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), ozone (O-3), fine particulate matter (PM2.5), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Utilizing electrified light-rail public transit as an observational platform enables real-time measurements with low operating costs while avoiding self-contamination from vehicle exhaust. We examine temporal averages and case studies of each species that reveal gradients, intermittent point sources, seasonal and did changes, and complex relationships resulting from emissions, atmospheric chemistry, and meteorological conditions. CO2 and NO2 are related through the combustion of fossil fuel and we observed a broad spatial gradient across the city as well distinct plumes at traffic intersections and, for NO2, a large plume adjacent to a locomotive rail yard. Distributions of O-3 were strongly correlated with NO2 due to atmospheric photochemical and titration processes. Episodes of high PM2.5 had distinct spatial patterns depending on meteorological conditions during wintertime persistent cold-air pool episodes. The spatial pattern of CH4 was characterized by distinct plumes associated with industrial and commercial facilities, some of which followed temporal patterns indicative of daytime working hours; other plumes were persistent throughout the whole day, suggestive of leak-related fugitive emissions. The ongoing multi-year record of spatial and temporal air quality observations provides a valuable data set for future air quality exposure studies. Our results suggest pollution and greenhouse gas emission monitoring and exposure assessment could be greatly enhanced by deploying instruments on public transit systems in urban centers worldwide.

AB Data assimilation is one of the effective ways to improve model predictions. In this study, surface fine particulate matter (PM2.5) observations during 16 December 2015 to 15 January 2016 over China are assimilated in a regional air quality forecasting system using the three-dimensional variational (3DVAR) method. Two parallel experiments with and without data assimilation (DA) are conducted. The results show that 3DVAR can significantly reduce the uncertainties of the initial PM2.5 fields and improve the subsequent PM2.5 forecasts at a certain extent. The influences of DA on both analysis and forecast fields are different in different areas. Overall, the root-mean-square error of analysis field could be reduced by at least 50%, and the correlation coefficient could be improved to more than 0.9. Less improvement appears in the North China Plain. For forecast field, similar with previous studies, the DA is effective only within a certain forecast time. On average, the benefits of DA could last more than 48 h over China. Much longer benefits (> 24 h) are found in Sichuan basin, Xinjiang, southern China and part of northern China. In the first 24 h, there are more than half of Chinese cities with their daily mean PM2.5 hit rates increasing greater than 10%. The duration of DA benefits are mainly affected by weather condition and emission intensity. The areas with longer DA benefits generally have more stable weather condition and/or weaker emission intensity. The absence of heterogeneous reactions in chemical transport models may also has negative effects on the durations. In addition, we found that the assimilated observation information could transport along with the air masses, and the downwind areas generally have better DA benefits, indicating that when doing air quality forecasting using nested domains, we should conduct the DA in the largest domain rather than the innermost one.

AB The Municipality of Naples, with about 1 million residents and about 3 million people living in the surroundings, suffers, as for many a city, from low air quality, as demonstrated by the concentration level of pollutants measured by fixed monitoring stations of the Regional Air Quality Network. The port of Naples is among the most important ports in the Mediterranean sea with a large traffic of passengers and goods. Therefore, it contributes to atmospheric pollution of the nearby urban area with ship emissions. Public authorities need to know the contribution of different sources of atmospheric pollutants to put effective environmental policies into practice. In this article, a bottom-up methodology has been developed to assess the amount of atmospheric pollutants emitted by cruise ships traffic and its impact on the atmospheric pollution in Naples. A detailed description of in-port activities of cruise ships has been applied to calculate emission rates of NO and SO. by using standard procedures corrected and integrated by real data to better evaluate actual engine power applied and fuel consumption. Considered activities include: navigation in port both at arrival and departure; maneuvering for berthing and unmooring and hoteling at berth. The study covers all cruise ship calls during the year 2016. The impact of cruise ship emissions on the urban area has been assessed by using the Gaussian puff model CALPUFF, thus obtaining contour maps of 1-h and year average values. Finally, in order to assess the contribution of cruise ship emissions to air quality, simulations have been compared with concentrations measured at fixed monitoring stations and during a monitoring campaign.

AB Size-resolved effective densities of ambient aerosols in Riverside, CA were determined over 4 periods during 2015-2016. A DMA-CPMA-CPC technique was used to measure effective density for particles with selected diameters of 50, 70, 101 and 152 nm. A catalytic stripper (CS) was used alternately to remove the volatile fraction of aerosol before density measurements. Aerosol non-refractory composition measurement was conducted in June 2016 campaign to understand the effect of chemical composition on particle density. The average densities for particles over all the measurement campaigns over BP mode (i.e. bypassing the CS) were 1.17 g/cm(3) at 50 nm and L25-1.28 g/cm(3) at 70, 101 and 152 nm. The average density after CS conditioning (CS mode) showed a decreasing trend from 1.22 g/cm(3) to 1.04 g/cm(3), with increase in the selected size, and a mass fractal dimension (D-f) of 2.85. Both the BP and CS mode particles showed the lowest effective density at 6-9 am and highest density at 11 a.m.-3 pm. The diurnal variation of density for both modes became more intensive as particle size increased. The variation was also more intense for the CS mode compared to the BP mode. Organic aerosol and ammonium nitrate mass in the size range of density measurements correlated well positively (R-2 = 0.78) and negatively (R-2 = 0.62), respectively with BP mode effective density. The study provides an update to the aerosol density profiles of a well-known receptor site (Riverside, CA) and investigates the transformation of particles in different seasons. The effective density profiles will be used in a follow-up study to better estimate the respiratory-deposited ambient aerosol mass.

AB Many European cities suffer from poor air quality and still exceed the European standards prescribed by the Air Quality Directive, and the guidelines recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). This is especially the case for PM2.5, focus of this work. While international, national and local level actions to reduce air pollution have undoubtedly resulted in an overall improvement of the air quality over the years, there are still problems, which are localised in specific regions and many cities. A key issue is to determine at which scale to act in order to abate these remaining air pollution problems most effectively. Central to this, for cities, is a quantitative assessment of the different origins of air pollution (urban, regional, national and transboundary) to support the design of efficient, effective air quality plans, which are a legal obligation for countries and regions whenever exceedances occur.
   The "Screening for High Emission Reduction Potentials for Air quality" tool (SHERPA) is used in this work to quantify the origins of air pollution in cities and regions, both from a spatial (urban, country...) and sectoral (transport, residential, agriculture...) perspectives. For PM2.5 we conclude that (1) for many cities, local actions at the city scale are an effective means of improving air quality in that city; (2) the target sectors and scales to abate air pollution are city specific, even for cities that are located in the same country. Consequently, it is important to take into account these city-specific circumstances when designing air quality plans and (3) for many cities, sectoral measures addressing agriculture at country or EU scale would have a clear benefit on urban air quality.

AB High fidelity, scale-resolving numerical simulations of flow and pollutant dispersion around several elongated isolated buildings are presented in this paper. The embedded large eddy simulation (ELES) is used to model flow and concentration fields for six test cases with various source-building geometries. Specifically, the influence of building aspect ratio, wind direction, and source location is examined with these cases. Results obtained from the present ELES model are evaluated using available wind tunnel measurements, including those of streamwise and spanwise velocities, turbulent kinetic energy, and streamwise, lateral, and spanwise pollutant concentrations. Comparisons indicate that the ELES provides realistic representations of the flow and concentration fields observed in wind tunnel experiments, and captures several complex phenomena including the lateral shift and enhanced descent of the plume for rotated/elongated buildings. Furthermore, the ELES provides a means to study the advective and turbulent concentration fluxes, plume shapes, and geometry of vortical structures that is used to examine turbulent transport of pollutants around buildings. We investigate the enhancement of vertical and lateral plume spread as the building aspect ratio is increased. In addition, through the study of advective and turbulent concentration fluxes, we shed light on the physics behind higher ground-level concentrations observed for rotated buildings.

AB While laboratory experiments, numerical simulations as well as field tests have underlined the influence of noise barriers in dispersing vehicular emissions and reducing downwind peak concentrations, these pollutants still remain in the atmosphere. Artificial pollutant sinks (for example, particle capturing or toxic gas treating devices) installed on top of noise barriers can further alleviate this problem by eliminating the pollutants passing through it. However, it is not known how the installation of a semi-permeable pollutant sink affects the aerodynamics of the pollutants' flow. By finding an optimal position and orientation for these sinks, the mass of the pollutants reaching the sink inlet can be maximized. Scaled down water tunnel experiments have been used to investigate the effectiveness of installing such a pollutant sink, of fixed dimensions, on top of a noise barrier adjacent to a highway. It is found that installing a sink is more beneficial on top of shorter barriers and that vertically elevating the sink, only slightly, can enhance its pollutant capturing performance. Using a sink in a 'highway canyon' (two noise barriers placed symmetrically with respect to the highway) must be done cautiously as there are several flow regimes observed, which are sensitive not only to the canyon aspect ratio (ratio between canyon width and height), but also to the presence/absence of the sink. The results here not only demonstrate the effectiveness of installing pollutant sinks on noise barriers, but also provide ballpark estimates on the optimal placement, orientation and performance of these devices, prior to field tests or even large-scale installation.

TI Annual emissions of air toxics emitted from crop residue open burning in

AB Southeast Asia (SEA) has large agricultural crop production and huge amounts of crop residues generated annually are commonly burned in the field to quickly clear land for the next crop planting. This study developed annual emission inventory for crop residue open burning (CROB) covering 17 emission species/groups for 10 SEA countries during 2010-2015, illustrated with relative contributions by country and by crop type. The fractions of crop residue subjected to open burning (OB), a large source of uncertainty in the activity data, compiled from surveys in SEA were significantly higher than those suggested in international databases. Emission factors for rice and maize residue OB were obtained from field experiments conducted in Thailand. The best estimates of the annual emissions averaged over 6 years, of air toxics were: 32 Gg of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, 0.03 Gg organ-chlorinated pesticides, 292 Gg total chlorines, and 94 g I-TEQ dioxins. Emissions of PM2.5, BC and OC, in Tg yr(-1), were respectively 1.8, 0.08 and 0.8. The coefficients of variation of annual emissions during the period were relatively small (2.6-8.6% depending on species) but still showed an increasing trend that reflected the changes in production of major crops during the period. Regionally, CROB shared 10-43% of the total biomass open burning emissions but varying with country: by far dominant in Vietnam and Philippines, and much less dominant in Indonesia, Myanmar, and Thailand. Rice straw open burning was the most dominant (19-97%) in the total CROB emissions of the 8 considered crops. The spatial distributions of annual emissions (0.1 degrees x 0.1 degrees) showed higher emission intensity over the areas cultivated with rice and sugarcane, while higher monthly emissions coincided with major harvesting periods in the dry season. The obtained EI data can be further used for air quality modeling to assess effects of CROB emission and to promote non-OB alternatives in the region.

AB Secondary organic aerosols (SOA) have significant effects on atmospheric chemistry, human health and climate forcing, but their formation mechanisms via Criegee chemistry are still poorly understood. Here we present a comprehensive theoretical investigation on the oligomerization reaction of stabilized Criegee intermediates (SCIs) with organic acid/peroxy radical by using ab initio quantum-chemical methodologies. Our results show that the ozonolysis of isoprene easily leads to a series of C3 and C4 stable CIs due to its larger exothermicity and spontaneity. The formed SCIs have two isomers: syn- and anti-, and anti- is more stable in energy than that of synby about 2-5 kcal mol(-1). The barrier heights of oligomerization reactions are very sensitive to the size and structure of functional groups near the central carbon atom site, indicating they can be tuned by the substitutions. Reaction between SCIs and peroxy radical contributes significantly to the formation of oligomer which is the dominant component of SOA. However, the reaction between SCIs and organic acid plays an important role in aerosol nucleation in some regions where high SCI and low H2O concentrations occur such as in terrestrial equatorial area. Such knowledge should be useful for understanding the mechanism of SOA formation from alkenes ozonolysis and for developing atmospheric chemistry models.

AB Recently atmospheric brown carbon (BrC) is recognized as an important contributor to light absorption and positive climate forcing. In this work, daily fine particulate matter (PM2.5) samples were collected over a full year (May 2015-May 2016) in Nanjing, and seasonal light absorption properties of water-soluble BrC were investigated. We found that winter samples had the strongest light absorption among four seasons. The light absorption at 365 nm (Abs(365)) for all seasons linked closely with secondary organic carbon (SOC), indicating a dominant contribution from secondary sources to BrC. However primary biomass burning might also contribute to BrC as revealed by the good correlations of Abs(365) versus levoglucosan fragments and/or K+, and such influence was more evident during summer. Furthermore, an Aerodyne soot-particle aerosol mass spectrometer (SP-AMS) was employed to determine the elemental ratios of BrC. We found that except in winter, the Abs(365) in general positively correlated with the average oxidation states (OS,) of BrC, suggesting more BrC were produced at higher OS,. The mass absorption efficiency at 365 nm (MAE(365)) showed no clear dependences on OS, during spring, summer and fall, but decreased against OS, during winter, indicating chemical aging may lead to photo bleaching of BrC in winter. Moreover, positive responses of Abs(365) and MAE(365) to N/C ratios were found during all seasons, indicating nitrogen-containing organics can be important BrC chromophores. Potential source areas of BrC were further discussed to improve our understanding of BrC sources in this region.

AB The increase of the global demand for dairy products is reflected in a rise of animal feed and forage productivity. In the coastal Atlantic climate conditions of northern Spain the maize-ryegrass rotation is a common management used to satisfy this forage demand. With the aim of mitigating greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions associated with fertilization in this type of intensive management, the use of nitrification inhibitors (NI) such as 3,4-dimethylpyrazol phosphate (DMPP) or the isomeric mixture of 2-(3,4-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-1-yl) succinic acid and 2-(4,5-dimethy1-1H-pyrazol-1-y1) succinic acid (DMPSA) could be a useful strategy. Until now, the new NI DMPSA has only been evaluated under Mediterranean conditions. The objective of this study was to compare the efficiency of DMPSA with respect to DMPP reducing GHG emissions when applied in a maize-ryegrass rotation under Atlantic climate conditions. Nitrogen fertilizer was applied as ammonium sulphate, with and without both NIs, split into two applications of 80 and 100 kg N ha(-1) in the case of maize and in three applications of 80, 60 and 60 kg N ha(-1) in the case of ryegrass. An unfertilized control treatment was also included. Nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) fluxes were measured using the closed chamber technique. The new NI DMPSA showed a similar behaviour to DMPP, mitigating N2O emissions down to the levels of the unfertilized soil. The effect of DMPSA reducing N2O losses lasted for the same time as for DMPP (1 < four months). CH4 fluxes were not affected by the application of any of both NIs. In terms of yield and quality, DMPSA and DMPP maintained the yield and the forage crude protein content of both maize and ryegrass.

AB Heterogeneous reactions of various atmospheric gaseous pollutants on particle surfaces are important pathways for the formation of secondary aerosols. However, these heterogeneous reactions are inevitable affected by each other in the real atmosphere. In this study, the impacts of the heterogeneous uptake of NO2 on the conversion of acetaldehyde on the particle surfaces in the absence and presence of simulated solar irradiation were investigated by using diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy (DRIFTS) at 298 K. It is found that in the absence of simulated solar irradiation the hydration reaction and subsequent polyoligomeric reaction as well as oligomeric reaction of CH3CHO are promoted by the pre-adsorption of NO2 for a short reaction time, but these reactions are significantly hindered, accompanied with the slightly enhanced formation of crotonaldehyde and adsorbed acetate by the pre-adsorption of NO2 for a longer time. In the presence of simulated solar irradiation, the occurrence of the aldol condensation and the oxidation of CH3CHO are promoted by the combined impacts of illumination, hydrogen bond (H-bond) catalysis, the enhanced surface acidity and the formed nitrite and nitrate, especially, the photolysis of the formed nitrite and nitrate, whereas the hydration reaction and subsequent polyoligomeric reaction as well as oligomeric reaction of CH3CHO molecules are suppressed. Meanwhile, the hydrogen bond catalysis for aldol condensation is significantly enhanced by light irradiation, showing a combined result of hydrogen bond catalysis and illumination. The heterogeneous reaction mechanism is proposed, and atmospheric implications based on these results are discussed in this study.

AB This work is focused on the relationship between the size distribution of some source tracers of atmospheric particulate matter (PM) and the oxidative potential (OP) of each PM size fraction. Size-segregated PM samples were collected by a multistage impactor (cut-sizes: 0.18, 0.32, 0.56, 1.0, 1.8, 3.2, 5.6, 10 and 18 mu m) in two geographical areas of Italy (Rome and Ferrara), characterized by different strength of the main PM sources. The samples were analysed by three different acellular OP methods: dithiothreitol (DTT), dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH) and ascorbate (AA) assay.
   Elemental (Li, Be, B, Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga, As, Se, Rb, Sr, Zr, Nb, Mo, Cd, Sn, Sb, Te, Cs, Ba, La, Ce, W, Tl, Pb, Bi and U) and ionic (C1(-), NO3-, SO42-, Na NH4+, K+, me(+), ca(2+)) composition of the same samples was also determined, in order to trace the contribution of the main PM sources. The size distribution of the OP values was compared to the size distribution of some PM source tracers, with the aim of identifying the PM sources that mostly influence the oxidative properties of atmospheric dust.
   AA assay resulted to be more sensitive towards coarse particles and OPAA showed a size distribution very similar to that of brake dust tracers. DTT and DCFH assays resulted instead more sensitive towards fine particles. OPDTT and OPDCPH values were comparable at the two sites; sources whose strength was very different in the two monitored areas (secondary contribution and, to a less extent, industrial sources) did not then contribute significantly to the measured OP values. The dimensional behaviour of OPDTT and OPDCFH was consistent with the contribution of biomass burning.

AB A large factor contributing to the uncertainties associated with sector specific anthropogenic methane emissions is the lack of available methods and data to reliably discriminate the different production processes. In this study, a variety of source apportionment techniques were investigated and developed to improve CH4 apportionment for co-located CH4 sources. The goal was to distinguish emissions from different systems at a midstream natural gas (NG) site (compressor station). Continuous measurements of atmospheric CH4 and co-emitted volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were analysed using Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and Positive Matrix Factorisation (PMF) receptor models. After sensitivity studies, significant extensions were made to the classical PCA, (Monte Carlo Absolute PCA 'MC-APCA' and Monte Carlo moving Absolute PCA 'MC-mAPCA') to better suit this application. Results from the receptor models are compared and combined with isotopic analysis, examining both long and short-term temporal variations. This work determined MC-APCA and PMF to be the most appropriate techniques for the long-term analysis of dominant sources; according to MC-mAPCA, this was identified to be 77.5 +/- 0.6% natural gas, while 66% of the remaining variability was associated with traffic related proxies. Techniques such as the moving Miller-Tans method for isotopic source identification and MC-mAPCA gave an insight into the short-term variability of source composition. During most CH4 enhancement periods, delta(CH4)-C-13 sources range from-40 parts per thousand to -45 parts per thousand, while MC-mAPCA typically show methane to ethane ratios of 4%-8%, confirming the prevalence of NG emissions. Both techniques identified CH4 enhancements from intermittently contributing sources (in this case a ruminant source characterised by delta(CH4)-C-13 -62 +/- 3 parts per thousand and 0% C2H6:CH4), and differentiate small fluctuations in NG source composition. Overall, the best method to identify CH4 sources from atmospheric local measurements remains strongly dependant on the characteristics of said source. The campaign investigated here required sensitive analysis as it was predominantly single sourced, and focussed on the identification of two gas streams. In such a case, it was found that a combination of old and novel techniques provide the greatest information on the characteristics of CH4 sources and gives confidence in the results.

AB Particulate matter (PM), especially those with an aerodynamic particle size of less than 10 mu m (PM10), is typically emitted from transboundary forest fires. A large-scale forest fire may contribute to a haze condition known as a high particulate event (HPE), which has affected Southeast Asia, particularly Peninsular Malaysia, for a long time. Such event can alter the photochemical reactions of secondary pollutants. This work investigates the influence of PM on ground-level ozone (O-3) formation during HPE. Five continuous air quality monitoring stations from different site categories (i.e., industrial, urban and background) located across Peninsular Malaysia were selected in this study during the HPEs in 2013 and 2014. Result clearly indicated that O-3 concentrations were significantly higher during HPE than during non-HPE in all the sites. The O-3 diurnal variation in each site exhibited a similar pattern, whereas the magnitudes of variation during HPE and non-HPE differed. Light scattering and atmospheric attenuation were proven to be associated with HPE, which possibly affected O-3 photochemical reactions during HPE. Critical conversion time was used as the main determining factor when comparing HPE and non-HPE conditions. A possible screening effect that resulted in the shifting of the critical transformation point caused a delay of approximately of 15-30 min. The shifting was possibly influenced by the attenuation of sunlight in the morning during HPE. A negative correlation between O-3 and PM10, was observed during the HPE in Kiang in 2013 and 2014, with -0.87. Essentially, HPE with a high PM concentration altered ground-level O-3 formation.

AB The exchange of reactive pollutants (NO, NO2, and O-3) at the top (roof level) of a street canyon are investigated using the parallelized large-eddy simulation model (PALM). The transport equations of NO, NO2, and O-3 with simple photochemical reactions are combined within the LES model for this study. NO and NO2 are emitted from an area source located near the canyon floor, and O-3 is included within the ambient air and inflow. A clockwise rotating vortex appears in the street canyon and transports NO, NO2, and O-3. NO and NO2 are transported along the ground and leeward wall and escape from the canyon at the roof level. O-3 enters the canyon at the roof level and is transported along the windward wall. The mean O-3 production rate is generally negative with large magnitudes at and near the roof level and near the windward wall. The chemical reactions reduce the mean NO and O-3 concentrations in the canyon by 31% and 84%, respectively, and increase the mean NO2 concentration in the canyon by 318%. The exchange of reactive pollutants at the roof level is significantly affected by small-scale eddies at the roof level and low- or high-speed streaks above the canyon. Air in the canyon with high NO and NO2 concentrations escapes from the canyon when low-speed air parcel appears due to small-scale eddies at the roof level or low-speed streak above the canyon. In contrast, air outside the canyon with a high O-3 concentration enters the canyon when high-speed air parcel appears because of small-scale eddies at the roof level or highspeed streak above the canyon. The time-lagged correlation analysis reveals that NO, NO2, and O-3 concentrations near the ground are affected by low- or high-speed streaks above the canyon but not significantly affected by small-scale eddies at the roof level.

AB Under acidic atmospheric conditions, iron leached from atmospheric mineral dust may influence the distribution of bioavailable iron at a global scale. However, the effects of non-Fe-containing minerals on iron dissolution remain unknown. This work describes metal-metal synergistic and antagonistic effects on iron dissolution that go beyond aggregation and ionic strength effects in mineral dust mixtures. In this study, we investigated iron mobilization by proton-promoted dissolution in natural mineral dust samples from the Kalahari Desert (SZ1) and Australian Red Dawn event (RO), along with one iron oxide proxy, hematite. The total iron dissolution in natural dust samples highly corresponds with the respective amount of Ti, rather than their particle sizes or Fe contents. The dust sample with high Ti content, SZ1, also showed a higher fraction of dissolved Fe(II), under dark conditions. These observations are in good agreement with the dissolution data for hematite artificially mixed with metal oxides. Total iron dissolution in hematite, mixed with TiO2, is 1.5- and 2-fold higher compared to that of just hematite under dark and light conditions, respectively. However, dissolution of hematite is suppressed when mixed with Al2O2 and CaO. Under dark conditions, furthermore, dissolved Fe(II) fraction is enhanced for hematite when mixed with TiO2 compared to that of other mixtures or hematite alone. Yet, dissolved Fe(II) is lower in hematite mixed with TiO2 under light conditions compared to that of hematite alone, suggesting photo oxidation of Fe(II) by reactive oxygen species, such as OH radicals.

AB Sulfate geoengineering is a proposed method to partially counteract the global radiative forcing from accumulated greenhouse gases, potentially mitigating some impacts of climate change. While likely to be effective in slowing increases in average temperatures and extreme precipitation, there are known side-effects and potential unintended consequences which have not been quantified. One such consequence is the direct human health impact. Given the significant uncertainties, we take a sensitivity approach to explore the mechanisms and range of potential impacts. Using a chemistry-transport model, we quantify the steady-state response of three public health risks to 1 degrees C global mean surface cooling. We separate impacts into those which are "radiative forcing driven", associated with climate change "reversal" through modification of global radiative forcing, and those "direct impacts" associated uniquely with using sulfate geoengineering to achieve this. We find that the direct (non-radiative forcing driven) impact is a decrease in global mortality of similar to 13,000 annually. Here the benefits of reduced ozone exposure exceed increases in mortality due to UV and particulate matter, as each unit of injected sulfur incurs 1/25th the particulate matter exposure of a unit of sulfur emitted from surface sources. This reduction is exceeded by radiative forcing-driven health impacts resulting from using sulfate geoengineering to offset 1 degrees C of surface temperature rise. Increased particulate matter formation at these lower temperatures results in similar to 39,000 mortalities which would have been avoided at higher temperatures. As such we estimate that sulfate geoengineering in 2040 would cause similar to 26,000 (95% interval: -30,000 to +79,000) early deaths annually relative to the same year without geoengineering, largely due to the loss of health benefits associated with CO2-induced warming. These results account only for impacts due to changes in air quality and UV-B flux. They do not account for non-mortality impacts or changes in atmospheric dynamics, and must be considered in the wider context of other climate change impacts such as heatwave frequency and sea level rise.

AB Health risk assessment of trace elements (TrElems) in fine particulate matter (PM2.5) has been studied based on the total element concentrations or more recently on the phosphate buffered saline (PBS)-soluble concentrations. However, behaviors of the TrElems released from PM2.5 change considerably as the interacting media change. In this study, the bioaccessibility of particulate-bound TrElems (V, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, As, Cd and Pb) were investigated using three kinds of simulated body fluids, artificial lung fluid (ALF), artificial sweat (AS), and artificial gastric juice (AGJ), comparing with the commonly used PBS. Many TrElems, especially Pb, showed lower solubility in PBS than that in other fluids. Cu, Mn, V and As were observed to be the most soluble TrElems in all simulated body fluids. Carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic effects were evaluated using ALF, AS and AGJ-soluble fractions (representing the corresponding exposure routes: inhalation, dermal contact and ingestion) according to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) human health risk assessment model. The carcinogenic risks of As and Pb were higher than 1 x 10(-6) (the acceptable level) for both adults and children. High hazard quotient (HQ) values for As and Pb were also observed for children, indicating a potential non-carcinogenic risk posed by these toxic elements. Our results demonstrated that the health risks of particulate-bound TrElems might be misjudged if using the PBS-soluble or total element contents alone.

AB The global distribution of aerosol optical depth (AOD) is simulated using an aerosol transport model coupled to an atmospheric general circulation model with high spatial and temporal resolution. Daily representative AOD from model simulation is estimated after consideration of observation sampling in daytime (ground-based) and overpass time (satellite) after cloud masking. Large deviations in AOD are found after considering temporally inhomogeneous sampling, with positive differences over desert regions and negative differences over anthropogenic pollution and biomass burning regions. Mean difference in daily AOD of 5.33% (standard deviation of 8.02%), because of temporal inhomogeneous sampling, is identified based on observation time information from the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Relative differences in AOD of > 50% and > 30% were found in 7.9% and 22.8% of the data, respectively. Based on the observation time information from the AERONET, relative root mean square error (rRMSE) of AOD due to temporal inhomogeneous sampling is estimated to be 4.30-18.66%. After correcting for temporal sampling inhomogeneity, the simulated global AOD was compared with AODs from MODIS and AERONET. The simulated AOD becomes lower than MODIS AOD because of emission and transport discrepancies related to dust, a limited accounting of nitrate processes, and limitation errors from MODIS AOD retrieval. A regional positive bias in SPRINTARS AOD was found in biomass burning regions, which is due to transport pattern errors related to the initial injection height of emissions. A weak correlation is found over the regions with multiple aerosol sources because of complex interactions of individual aerosol types.

AB This study investigates the production/loss of sulfate on the sea surface during its transport from Eastern China to South Korea (Korea). We use the Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ) model to simulate sulfate concentrations in February 2015 and to examine the changes in them. Results of the CMAQ simulation show high sulfate concentrations over the sea surface areas between Eastern China and Korea despite nearly zero emissions. Their concentrations gradually increased (from 0.371 to 0.581 mu g/m(3)/h) as they passed through the East China Sea, the Yellow Sea, and the Korea Strait. The results from a quantitative analysis using the integrated process rate (IPR) in CMAQ suggest that increasing sulfate concentrations during the transport was mainly attributable to chemical sulfate productions by the aerosol process (up to 0.866 mu g/m(3)/h) and vertical transport (up to 0.994 mu g/m(3)/h) of chemically produced sulfate, resulting from vertical momentum transport caused by vertical wind shear and temperature gradient. The results of the sulfur tracking model (STM) in CMAQ verify that the OH + SO2 -> H2SO4 + HO2 reaction was the largest contributor (82.31%) to the production of sulfate over the sea surface areas during its transport. Surplus SO2 in the transporting plume reacted to abundant OH over the sea surface, formed H2SO4, and contributed to the consequently increased sulfate concentrations. The observed sulfate data in Korea confirm that sulfate concentrations over the sea surface areas enhanced sulfate concentrations in Korea (from 12.27 to 13.74 mu g/m(3)). The sulfate, however, was not directly transported from upwind regions but chemically produced during the transport. The results of several sensitivity simulations with varied meteorology revealed that the changes in chemical sulfate production rates during the transport of sulfate were mainly affected by temperature.

AB Biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) play an important role in the formation of tropospheric ozone. In the present work, biogenic emissions over the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region for year 2014 were developed based on the interpretation of remote sensing image and MODIS data using the Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (MEGAN). Impact of BVOCs emissions over the YRD region on ozone formation was investigated based on the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF)-Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ) modeling system for July 2014. Two parallel scenarios-with and without BVOCs emissions-were developed to evaluate the influence of BVOC5 emission on ozone formation. Biogenic emissions were estimated to be 18.86 x 10(5) ton yr(-1) over the YRD region for year 2014, with higher emissions in the southern YRD region than the northern region, and higher emissions in summer than other seasons. Model evaluation showed fairly good model performances, with the index of agreement (IOA) of meteorological parameters and ozone concentrations of 0.80-0.95 and 0.76-0.91, respectively. Ozone concentrations mainly concentrated in the northwest, which is the downwind of the YRD region in summer. Impact of biogenic emissions on ozone formation exhibited a strong spatial pattern: high contributions were observed in the middle YRD region, including Bengbu, Tongling, Hefei, Huzhou, Nanjing and Zhenjiang, with the maximum hourly ozone contribution of 18.43-36.1814/m(3) during July 18 to 23. Ozone concentrations in rural areas would be more likely to be influenced by BVOCs emissions than urban areas.

AB This paper presents an analysis of data from a wind tunnel (Heist et al., 2009) conducted to study dispersion of emissions from three depressed roadway configurations; a 6 m deep depressed roadway with vertical sidewalls, a 6 m deep depressed roadway with 30 sloping sidewalls, and a 9 m deep depressed roadway with vertical sidewalls. The width of the road at the bottom of the depression is 36 m for all cases. All these configurations induce complex flow fields, increase turbulence levels, and decrease surface concentrations downwind of the depressed road compared to those of the at-grade configuration. The parameters of flat terrain dispersion models are modified to describe concentrations measured downwind of the depressed roadways. In the first part of the paper, a flat terrain model proposed by van Ulden (1978) is adapted. It turns out that this model with increased initial vertical dispersion and friction velocity is able to explain the observed concentration field. The results also suggest that the vertical concentration profiles of all cases under neutral conditions are best explained by a vertical distribution function with an exponent of 1.3. In the second part of the paper, these modifications are incorporated into a model based on the RUNE (Snyder et al., 2013) line-source dispersion model. While this model can be adapted to yield acceptable estimates of near-surface concentrations (z < 6 m) measured in the wind tunnel, the Gaussian vertical distribution in RUNE, with an exponent of 2, cannot describe the concentration at higher elevations. Our findings suggest a simple method to account for depressed highways in models such as RUNE and AERMOD through two parameters that modify vertical plume spread.

AB Nitrate has become the most important hydrophilic chemical component in PM2.5 during serious air pollution periods in urban areas of the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region of south China, but there is a lack of fully understanding of its formation mechanisms and controlling factors, especially during daytime nitrate episodes. To fill the knowledge gap, water-soluble inorganic ions in PM2.5 and trace gases including SO2, HNO3, NH3, NOx and O-3, particle size distribution, vertical profile of aerosol backscatter density, and ground-level and vertical profiles of key meteorological variables were simultaneously measured at high time resolution in urban Guangzhou of the PRD. The remarkably enhanced nitrate mass concentrations observed at the surface-level during daytime were identified to be caused by strong boundary-layer turbulent mixing of residual aerosols produced from evaporation of low-level shallow stratocumulus clouds. This finding may have important implications on the sources of secondary inorganic aerosols in this and other similar cloudy regions.

AB The estimation of particle removal rates in closed atmospheric environments such as rooms or airplanes is of great interest because it is directly relevant to air quality and disease transmission. In this work we investigate experimentally and numerically the depletion of micron-sized particles inside a turbulent, naturally driven enclosure flow. The enclosure is a cubical cavity with side 0.7 m in which two opposite vertical walls are held at different temperatures while other walls are adiabatic. The transport of monodisperse SiO2 particles with diameter 0.5, 1.0, and 2.5 mu m was studied at Rayleigh numbers varying in the range of 3 x 10(8) to 10(9), corresponding to temperature differentials Delta T from 10 to 40 K. The decay time constant of the airborne particle concentration was calculated from discrete measurements performed with an Electrical Low-Pressure Impactor. It is found that the temperature difference greatly influences the deposition of particles with sizes equal to or less than 1 pm in diameter. For this particle range, thermophoresis becomes important and hence the larger the Delta T, the larger the deposition, a significant part of which taking place on the cold wall by the thermophoretic effect. As a result, the decay time constant of submicron particles is up to 5 times smaller than predicted by the stirred settling model, depending on the imposed AT. For the largest particles with diameter 2.5 mu m, the influence of thermophoresis and hence AT is negligible, and particle removal rates are in line with the stirred settling model predictions, with mostly gravity dominated deposition on the bottom wall. A Large Eddy Simulation of the tests was performed using an Euler-Lagrange approach, and predictions of the decay time constant are within less than 20% of the measured values.

AB The road transportation sector contributes largely to air pollution in urban areas, why the knowledge of accurate vehicle emission factors (EF) is crucial to prepare reliable emission inventories, which, in turn, are strategic tools for air quality management. Curbside and rooftop concentrations of several traffic-related species were measured within a busy street canyon in Londrina (Brazil). EF for NOx, black carbon (BC), fine particles (PM2.5) and particle number (PN) were calculated based on these measurements and on inverse modeling using the Operational Street Pollution Model (OSPM). We highlight the importance of this work in quantifying BC, PM2.5, NOx and PN emissions from vehicles driven in an urban area under real conditions in a continent-sized country where there is a lack of EF studies. In the case of EFPN, we report the first value in the entire South America. Our EF were consistent with results from other on-road studies, but much higher than laboratory measurements conducted in Brazil and Europe, especially for particles (quantified as mass and number). This finding suggests that the EF derived from laboratory tests should be revised for all vehicle categories, since inaccurate values can have major implications on the compilation of official national inventories for the road transportation sector and on the assessment of their health and climate (in the case of BC) impacts. Incorporating certification procedures that more closely resemble real driving conditions is highly recommended. Limitations of the EF determined in this research for application in other studies are also discussed.

AB The performance of the novel ammonium chemical ionization time of flight mass spectrometer (NH4+-CI3-TOF) utilizing NH4+ adduct ion chemistry to measure first generation oxidized product molecules (OMs) as well as highly oxidized organic molecules (HOMs) was investigated for the first time. The gas-phase ozonolysis of cyclohexene served as a first test system. Experiments have been carried out in the TROPOS free-jet flow system at close to atmospheric conditions. Product ion signals were simultaneously observed by the NH4+-CI3-TOF and the acetate chemical ionization atmospheric pressure interface time of flight mass spectrometer (acetate-CI-APITOF). Both instruments are in remarkable good agreement within a factor of two for HOMs. For OMs not containing an OOH group the acetate technique can considerably underestimate OM concentrations by 2-3 orders of magnitude. First steps of cyclohexene ozonolysis generate ten different main products, detected with the ammonium-CI3-TOF, comprising 93% of observed OMs. The remaining 7% are distributed over several minor products that can be attributed to HOMs, predominately to highly oxidized RO2 radicals. Summing up, observed ammonium-CI3-TOF products yield 5.6 x le molecules cm" in excellent agreement with the amount of reacted cyclohexene of 4.5 x 10(9) molecules cm(-3) for reactant concentrations of [O-3] = 2.25 x 10(12) molecules cm(-3) and [cyclohexene] = 2.0 x 10(12) molecules cm(-3) and a reaction time of 7.9 s. NH4+ adduct ion chemistry is a promising CIMS technology for achieving carbon-closure due to the unique opportunity for complete detection of the whole product distribution including also peroxy radicals, and consequently, for a much better understanding of oxidation processes.

AB Savanna ecosystems play a crucial role in global N2O emissions. However, our understanding of N2O emissions under limiting precipitation conditions is lacking. This study evaluates the effects of precipitation reduction on soil N2O fluxes from a woody savanna ecosystem in Yunnan Province, Southwest China. Precipitation exclusion shelters were installed above the tree canopy, and four total treatments were established as follows: a control (CK) and precipitation exclusions of 30% (PE3), 50% (PE5), and 70% (PE7). Two years (2015-2016) of N2O fluxes, soil temperature and soil water content data were collected. The N2O fluxes were generally low, ranging from 0.039 to 0.245 mg N m(-2) day(-1), and they were strongly linked to precipitation events. Additionally, the N2O fluxes during the rainy season were significantly greater than those during the dry season. The maximum N2O flux was observed in August, and the minimum flux occurred in December. Precipitation exclusion had a significant negative influence on the N2O fluxes. The N2O emissions of CK, PE3, PE5, and PE7 were 0.20, 0.17, 0.13, and 0.12 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. With the exacerbation of precipitation exclusion, the decrease rate of precipitation exclusion on the N2O emissions increased over the entire year (eventually reaching 41.8% in PE7), but the decrease rate of precipitation exclusion on the soil N2O emission during the dry season was stronger than that during the rainy season. Additionally, the proportion of dry season N2O emissions to total annual emissions decreased (from 45% to 41%), and that of rainy season N2O emissions to total annual emissions increased (from 55% to 59%) over the year, whereas they exhibited a stable trend from PE5. The data show that the Yuanjiang savanna is a net source of N2O; precipitation reduction decreases the N2O emissions in the savanna regions, indicating that precipitation reduction can only slow the increase in the N2O concentration in the atmosphere and can therefore slow global warming. In addition, the N2O emissions during the dry season may play a significant role in total N2O emissions and be more sensitive to precipitation reduction than those during rainy season. These possibilities should be considered in future studies, especially in those ecosystems that experience substantial inter-annual climatic fluctuations.

AB Missing or incomplete data in short or long intervals is a common problem in measuring air pollution. Severe issues may arise when dealing with missing data for time-series prediction schemes or mean analysis. This study aimed to develop a new regression imputation framework to impute missing values in the hourly air quality data set of Tehran and enhance the applicability of Tehran Air Pollution Forecasting System (TAPFS). The proposed framework was designed based on three types of features including measurements of other stations, WRF and CAMx physical models. In this framework, elastic net and neuro-fuzzy networks were efficiently combined in a two-layer structure. The framework was applied on Tehran's air pollution monitoring network. The hourly imputing results of the suggested method were seen to be superior to existing methods according to statistical criteria such as RMSE, MAE and R-values. Average R-values of 0.88, 0.73, 0.76 and 0.79 were obtained for O-3, NO, PM2.5 and PM10, respectively. The measurements of other stations had the main predictive power with a modest increase for the two physical models. The benefit of the models was somewhat higher for stations on boundaries of monitoring network. In addition, the central stations had better performance than the boundary stations and an approximately 0.05 increase was obtained in average R-value.

AB This study quantifies ammonia (NH3) emissions from biomass burning from 2005 to 2015 across the continental US (CONUS) and compares emissions from biomass burning with the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) National Emissions Inventory (NEI), the Fire Inventory from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (FINN) and the Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED). A statistical regression model was developed in order to predict NH3 emissions from biomass burning using a combination of fire properties and meteorological data. Satellite data were used to evaluate the annual fire strength and frequency as well as to calculate the total NH3 emissions across the CONUS. The results of this study showed the total fire number has decreased, while the total yearly burn area and the average fire radiative power has increased. The average annual NH3 emissions from biomass burning from this study, on a national scale, were approximately 5.4e8 +/- 3.3e8 kg year(-1). When comparing the results of this study with other emission inventories, it was found that ammonia emissions estimated by the NEI were approximately a factor of 1.3 lower than what was calculated in this study and a factor of 1.1 lower than what was modeled using the statistical regression model for 2010-2014. The calculated NH3 emissions from biomass burning were a factor of 5.9 and a factor of 13.1 higher than the emissions from FINN and the GFED, respectively. The modeled NH3 emissions from biomass burning were a factor of 5.0 and a factor of 11.1 higher than the emissions from FINN and the GFED, respectively. As the climate continues to change, the pattern (frequency, intensity and magnitude) of fires across the US will also change, leading to changes in NH3 emissions. The statistical regression model developed in this study will allow prediction of NH3 emissions associated with climate change.

AB A new convective turbulent dust emission (CTDE) empirical parameterization scheme was developed and validated using the observational data of dust concentrations and meteorological parameters over the Horqin Sandy Land area. Moreover, different CTDE schemes were compared and discussed. The statistical results from the observations in 2016 showed that the proportion of dust emission fluxes emitted by CTDE is 27% for all dust emission which indicates that the significance of CTDE events for the contribution of atmospheric dust aerosols. In addition, dust emission fluxes emitted by CTDE constituted up to 78% of the total dust emission fluxes due to direct aerodynamic entrainment, which verified that CTDE is indeed the most important and major form of aerodynamic entrainment dust emission. A new CTDE empirical parameterization scheme (F-mod = 2.93 x w(1.5), where 144, is the convective velocity scale), was established and validated based on nine typical CTDE events observed at the Horqin site in 2016, and the model predictions of the new CTDE scheme were in a good agreement with the observations both in magnitude and variation. The results of the model predictions using the MK14 scheme and Li scheme were also good, but their schemes exaggerated the impact of shear-driven turbulence, which caused discrepancies between the new empirical parameterization scheme and the MK14 scheme. Moreover, effects of soil moisture on CTDE were investigated in this study, and the results showed that there was no obvious relationship between soil moisture content and F-obs during CTDE events. This finding was likely because only dust particles in the upper few millimeters of the soil surface, where soil moisture content was relatively low in semi-arid region, can be emitted into the atmosphere during CTDE events due to weak wind speeds. In addition, compared with the saltation-bombardment and/or aggregation-disintegration dust emission (SADE) event, the process of a CTDE event may be aerodynamic lift limitation, not supply limitation.

   Methods: We analysed data on daily natural- (ICD 10: A00-R99), respiratory- (ICD 10: J00-J99) and circulatory cause mortality (ICD 10: I00-I99) for each of Spain's 52 provinces across the period 2000-2009. We calculated the impact of ozone on mortality by reference to relative risks (RRs) using generalised linear models, and performed an overall meta-analysis. Attributable mortality was calculated on the basis of RRs.
   Results: A quadratic relationship was observed and the existence of a threshold value identified in 33 of the 46 monitoring stations judged to be valid for ozone data, this threshold value was located above the 80th percentile. The overall RRs for 10 mu g/m(3) increases in concentrations of the 03 threshold value were as follows: 1.033 (95%C1: 1.023-1.044) for natural causes; 1.089 (95%C1: 1.058-1.120) for respiratory causes; and 1.025 (95%CI: 1.018-1.033) for mortality circulatory causes. The annual total of natural-cause ozone-attributable deaths was 499 (95%CI: 277-717), 126 of which (95%CI: 54-194) were due to respiratory causes and 167 (95%CI: 39-293) to circulatory causes.
   Conclusions: High ozone concentrations display a quadratic relationship with daily mortality. While this effect is more pronounced in respiratory causes, there is also a short-term effect on natural- and circulatory-cause mortality.

AB Marine isoprene concentrations in the East China Sea were measured during two oceanographic cruises: one from October 10, 2013 to November 21, 2013 and another from May 16, 2014 to June 13, 2014. Mean (range) isoprene concentrations in the surface water in the study area were 32.85 (16.31-108.2) pmol L-1 in late spring and 26.83 (11.22-42.13) pmol L-1 in autumn. The isoprene concentrations showed seasonal variation and were higher in late spring, which could be attributable to terrigenous diluted water and seasonal variations of phytoplankton structure. Isoprene and chlorophyll a (Chl-a) concentrations were significantly correlated in late spring and autumn even under complex hydrographic conditions. Isoprene and Chl-a concentrations also exhibited similar variations during a 25 h period and remained high during daytime. Analysis of depth profiles indicated that isoprene concentrations in the water column peaked at the surface layer and gradually decreased with increasing depth. The atmospheric concentration of isoprene (average: 53.4 ppt; range: 14.8-141 ppt) was high in the onshore area but low in the offshore area in late spring. The mean sea-to-air fluxes of isoprene in the East China Sea were 36.12 (late spring) and 48.34 (autumn) nmol m(-2) d(-1). Results revealed the substantial isoprene emission from surface seawater, which was also a net source of atmospheric isoprene during the study period.

AB Ammonium sulfate (AS) particles of submicron size are a major component of inorganic aerosol, and are regarded as a long-range transboundary air pollutant in Asia. However, only a few studies have focused on the effects of submicron AS particles on plants. In the present study, we investigated the amount of submicron AS particles deposited on the leaf surface of komatsuna plants (Brassica rapa L. var. perviridis), and their effects on nocturnal leaf (g(night)) and cuticular (g(out)) conductance. The plants were grown for 23 days after sowing in a naturally lit phytotron at air temperature of 25.0 +/- 1.0 degrees C/18.0 +/- 1.0 degrees C (6:00-18:00/18:00-6:00) and relative air humidity of 70 +/- 5%, and were artificially exposed to submicron AS particles at the 21st day after sowing. The exposure to submicron AS particles resulted in average daily atmospheric concentration of SO42- in PM2.5 inside the phytotron of 16.5 mu g m(-3). After the end of exposure, the plants were kept under light or dark conditions for 48 h in the phytotron. The amount of SO42- deposited on the leaf surface reduced over time, but did not significantly differ between the plants kept under light and dark conditions at 0, 6, 12, 18, 30, and 48 h after the end of exposure. An exposure to submicron AS particles with average daily atmospheric concentration of SO42- in PM2.5 inside the phytotron of 24.7 mu g m(-3) did not significantly affect the g(cut) of the plants. At 1.5 and 5 h after the end of exposure, the g(night) was significantly higher in the submicron AS particle-exposed plants than in the non-exposed control plants. These results indicate that submicron AS particles deposited on the leaf surface enhance the nocturnal water consumption of komatsuna plants.

AB A methodology utilizing multiple aerosol measurements and reanalysis was developed to analyze the long-range transport (LRT) of North African and Asian dust events and their effect on contiguous U.S. (CONUS) air quality.
   Two events in 2015, that originated inland from North Africa and Asia, were detected with aerosol optical depth (AOD) greater than 0.8 over the Gulf of Mexico (June 21) and west coast of Oregon and Washington (April 19). Large amounts of dust were rising over Sahara-Sahel and Taklamakan deserts during these events. For the North African dust event, dust remained the dominant aerosol species transporting from North Africa to CONUS. For Asian dust, before the Taklamakan dust outbreak traveled across the Pacific Ocean, it mixed with sulfate from East China and organic carbons from Siberia. The trans-Atlantic North African dust emerged and compressed below 5 km over the Azores High, whereas the trans-Pacific Asian dust entered the westerlies (5-10 km) along with the mid-latitude frontal system.
   For the two cases examined, the North African dust event tended to have more influence on CONUS air quality. During the LRT periods, there were 4 of 17 rural and suburban stations (with AOD > 0.5 as the LRT dust approached) in Texas and Louisiana reporting PM2.5 daily maximum observations greater than 36.3 mu g m(-3). In contrast, the Asian dust stayed above ground level, and all of the 4 rural and suburban stations (with AOD > 0.5 as the LRT dust approached) in Washington and Oregon observed daily maximum PM2.5 below 22.4 mu g m(-3). The integration of measurements and modeling was able to successfully characterize the sources and transport patterns of the LRT dust events, and differentiate their influence on CONUS air quality. Even though there was high AOD from the Asian LRT dust detected over the western CONUS, significant impacts on surface air quality was not observed as the dust remained aloft.Capsule: The integration of multiple measurements with model simulations was an effective approach with which to assess the long-range transport of dust storms and their impact on contiguous U.S. air quality.

AB The Pasquill system was designed to describe dispersion conditions and was never intended to be a "stand-alone" measure of stability, but it has nevertheless been used to characterize stability in a wide range of applications unrelated to atmospheric dispersion. In this study we evaluate whether the method's underlying assumptions are sufficiently robust for characterizing stability, and whether the method provides acceptable characterizations when used as a stability classification tool outside the context of atmospheric dispersion.
   Observed temperature lapse rates at six locations across Eurasia largely fail to support the Pasquill method's "exclusivity" assumptions prohibiting the identification of stable classes during daytime, unstable classes at night, and all non-neutral classes during day/night transition and overcast periods. While observed nighttime stability is mostly stable or neutral and thus largely consistent with the Pasquill method, daytime lapse rates frequently indicate stable conditions. Moreover, the majority of lapse rates during day/night transition periods are non-neutral. Substantial seasonal variability is observed in diurnal stability variations and is unaccounted for in the Pasquill system. When compared with observed stability based on lapse rates, the Pasquill classification scheme exhibits a strong neutral bias at most sites. The method performs particularly poorly during daytime, correctly identifying instability in only 1%-29% of cases at the sites analyzed. Nighttime stability is correctly identified more frequently, but the strength of nocturnal stability is overestimated at all sites analyzed.

AB Polar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) derivatives like nitrated and oxygenated PAHs have higher toxic potentials than the parent one, and are receiving growing interests. In this study, we investigated household air pollution and personal exposure to nitro- and oxy-PAHs during a winter period in rural Shanxi, northern China. The overall arithmetic means of 24-h average indoor nitro-PAHs and oxy-PAHs were 10.2 +/- 3.6 and 76.8 +/- 51.8 ng/m(3), respectively, that were much higher than the 7.98 +/- 4.30 and 54.7 +/- 45.4 ng/m(3) in the outdoor air. Nearly 90% of particulate PAHs derivatives were enriched in fine PM2.5 and even finer PM1.0 fraction. Daily inhalation exposure to nitro- and oxy-PAHs for the rural population were 8.41 +/- 3.08 and 68.5 +/- 79.7 ng/m(3), respectively. Residents burning briquette for cooking were found to have lower household air pollution and exposure levels compared with those burning wood. The calculated time-weighted average concentration overestimated, though correlated positively, the daily inhalation exposure compared to the that from personal carried samplers.

ID BOUNDARY-LAYER; IMPACT; PARAMETERIZATION; SIMULATION; EUROPE; AREA
AB The European Directive (2008/50/EC) encourages the use of models in the assessment and forecasting of air quality, and assigns them a supporting or replacing role with respect to fixed ground-based measurements. A thorough knowledge of performance of the modeling tools over urban areas is therefore required. In this study, we analyze sensitivity tests with the WRF-CHIMERE modeling system in order to investigate the effect of (1) the horizontal model grid size, (2) the resolution of the anthropogenic emission inventory, and (3) the introduction of urban canopy models. The work focuses on L'Aquila and Milan, two Italian cities widely differing for the number of inhabitants, the extension and the geographical location. We found a clear advantage in increasing the model resolution up to 4 km, but a further increase at 1 km resolution does not seem to be justified. Moreover, we found that the ozone simulation is generally degraded at higher resolution. The introduction of a more detailed treatment of the urban canopy and of the anthropogenic emissions suggests the potential for further improvement, but this requires a fine tuning on the area of application. For example, the Building Environment Parameterization corrects the surface wind speed daily cycle, but it also increases the planetary boundary layer height, resulting in excessive dilution of primary pollutants. The anthropogenic emissions should be refined proportionally to the increase in dynamic model resolution, possibly through new bottom-up inventories, rather than through a downscaling of a coarser inventory. We suggest that future work should primarily focus on intensive campaign periods, where a comprehensive observational characterization of the three dimensional structure and evolution of the planetary boundary layer is available.

AB The wildfires in Fort McMurray of Alberta, Canada, injected large amounts of smoke aerosols in May 2016 and were identified as being one of Canada's major weather events of the year. This paper presents a synergistic remote sensing and in-situ measurement of the resultant smoke plume transport, optical properties, and its impacts on local air quality in New York City (NYC). Comparisons with the operational air quality model forecast (the NOAA National Air Quality Forecasting Capability, NAQFC) performance are presented. The aloft plume intrusions on May 9-13 and 25-29, 2016, and their mixing down into the planetary-boundary layer (PBL) were observed by a combined lidar, ceilometer and other measurement. A decrease in single-scattering albedo and absorption Angstrom exponent near one indicates that the plumes were absorbing aerosol dominated. Dramatic impacts of smoke transport on the ground air quality are demonstrated with a coincident increase of ground PM2.5 (from 5- to 25-30 mu g/m(3)) in NYC urban and upwind rural area, enhancement of the PM2.5 speciation (organic carbon, elemental carbon, potassium ion (K)) and the ozone exceedance of NAAQS. Using the satellite and model product, we show regional spatial distribution of smoke, multiple transport paths and wildfire sources. Finally, with the lidar vertical profiling observations, we evaluate the model PBL-height (PBLH) and PM2.5 during May 24th to 30th, 2016. The model PBLH shows consistent diurnal variation with the observed mixing layer height (MLH), but is clearly overestimated during the convective daytime hours. On the other hand, when estimating the MLH directly from the model PM2.5 profile, better agreement with observation was indicated. This helps explain the good agreement between the model PM2.5 and surface measurements except for the model overestimate during the morning of May 25 and 26, 2016.

AB The World Health Organization estimates 3.7 million deaths in 2012 in low- and middle-income Asian countries due to outdoor air pollution. However, these estimates do not account for the higher exposures of specific particulate matter (PM) components - including fine particles (PM2.5), ultrafine particles (UFP) and black carbon (BC)- typical of transport microenvironments (TMEs). With the rapidly growing number of on-road vehicles in Asia, human exposure to PM is an increasing concern. The aim of this review article is to comprehensively assess studies of PM2.5, UFP, and BC in Asian TMEs in order to better understand the extent of exposure, the underlying factors leading to exposure, and how Asian exposures compare to those found in Europe and the United States of America (USA). The health impacts of exposure to PM2.5, UFP, and BC are described and the key factors that influence personal exposure in TMEs (i.e., walk, cycle, car, and bus) are identified. Instrumentation and measurement methods, exposure modeling techniques, and regulation are reviewed for PM2.5, UFP, and BC. Relatively few studies have been carried out in urban Asian TMEs where PM2.5, UFP, and BC had generally higher concentrations compared to Europe and USA. Based on available data, PM2.5 concentrations while walking were 1.6 and 1.2 times higher in Asian cities (average 42 mu g m(-3)) compared to cities in Europe (26 mu g m-3) and the USA (35 mu g m(-3)), respectively. Likewise, average PM2.5 concentrations in car (74 mu g m(-3)) and bus (76 mu g m(-3)) modes in Asian cities were approximately two to three times higher than in Europe and American cities. UFP exposures in Asian cities were twice as high for pedestrians and up to similar to 9-times as high in cars than in cities in Europe or the USA. Asian pedestrians were exposed to similar to 7-times higher BC concentrations compared with pedestrians in the USA. Stochastic population-based models have yet to be applied widely in Asia but can be used to quantify inter-individual and inter-regional variability in exposures and to assess the contribution of TMEs to total exposures for multiple pollutants. The review also highlights specific gaps in the Asian TME data set that need to be filled since UFP and BC studies were rare as were studies of pedestrian and cyclist exposure.

AB We investigate secondary organic aerosol (SOA) and gas phase organic acid yields from the sequential photo oxidation of seven monoterpene isomers (alpha-pinene, beta-pinene, limonene, sabinene, terpinolene, alpha-terpinene, and gamma-terpinene) using an Oxidative Flow Reactor under dry conditions. SOA yields were highest for terpinolene (33% at 5.7 days of aging), followed by sabinene, beta-pinene, alpha-pinene, limonene, gamma-terpinene, and alpha-terpinene. Isomers with exocyclic double bonds (i.e. immediately adjacent to a ring) had higher SOA yields than those with endocyclic double bonds, or with double bonds that are unattached to a ring structure. SOA yields increased with OH exposure, highlighting the limitation of using single values for SOA yield in modeling studies, and the need for isomer-specific SOA parameterization. SOA yields were adequately fit by a one-product model and in broad agreement with previous studies. SOA yields linearly increased with organic aerosol mass concentration, possibly the result of high OH loading and short residence times in the flow reactor. Gas phase yields of formic, acetic, butyric, and methacrylic acid (or their isomers) followed very different patterns as a function of OH exposure from SOA yields, and were poorly correlated with OH rate constants. These observations suggest that higher volatility (fragmentation) products of monoterpene photooxidation were produced and lost on different timescales from the production and condensation of lower-volatility (functionalization) products. Formic acid yields ranged from 0.06 to 9.3% across all OH exposures. Formic acid yields from gamma-terpinene (0.36-3%) monotonically increased with OH exposure, unlike the other monoterpene isomers, which exhibited initial increases in formic acid yields with OH exposure, followed by decreases at higher OH concentrations. This difference in organic acid yield trends is consistent with the distribution of carbon-containing species identified by chemical ionization mass spectrometry.

AB Aerosol abundance from widespread deserts over the Arabian Peninsula (AP) plays an important role in the regional climate and air quality. This study investigates the spatio-temporal variability of Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) ranging from seasonal to inter-annual time scales during the period 2003-2016 using satellite retrievals from MISR and MODIS, together with ground-based observations from the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) available during the period 2003-2012 over the AP. The MODIS AOD (MISR AOD) observations exhibit 0.81 and 0.85 (0.71 and 0.76) correlations with ground-based observations during the wet and dry seasons, respectively. The correlations were also found to be significant with respect to the surface monitoring station at Solar village in Saudi Arabia. Our observational analysis reveals higher (lower) concentrations of AOD during dry (wet) seasons over the AP. The observed AODs indicate similar spatial distributions over annual and seasonal time scales, with high AODs over the Southern Red sea (SR), and the Northeast AP, and lower AODs over the central and southern end of the AP. It is also observed that the AOD exhibits year-to-year variations over different subregions of the AP. Analyses of the inter-annual variability over the AP reveals a significant relationship between the AOD and El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) during the summertime. Furthermore, positive AOD anomalies over the AP can be closely linked with the intensification of the westerly jet at the Tokar Gap during La Nina phases. Enhanced monsoon associated heat low over the AP during La Nina phases further favors greater uplift and saltation of dust from desert regions.

AB In previous studies, a number of model-based dust forecasts and early warning systems have been developed for the prevention of environmental impacts due to dusts. However, the accuracy of the model is limited by imperfect identification of dust emissions, in particular by the friction velocity threshold parameterization in the emission process.
   In this study, an integrated dust storm forecast system - LOTOS-EUROS/Dust coupled with reduced-tangent linearization 4DVar data assimilation has been developed. In order to overcome the inflexibility and inaccuracy of the existing friction velocity threshold parameterization in large-scale models, a spatially varying multiplicative factor for the threshold is introduced. This parameter is estimated by assimilating measurements from a field station network developed by China Ministry of Environmental Protection. The data assimilation algorithm is adjoint-free, and its computational complexity increases with the number of uncertain parameters. Two model reducing techniques, sensitivity-based parameter filters and proper orthogonal decomposition, are sequentially implemented after each other, which lead to a reduction of parameter dimension from initially O(10(4)) to O(10(2)).
   Twin experiments are conducted to evaluate the impact of assimilation settings on the dust forecast accuracy. In addition, experiments with real observations are conducted. However, these observations also reflect the aerosol concentration from local emissions. To effectively use these observations as representative for dust concentrations, an observation bias correction and a variable representation error are designed. Improvements on the dust storm forecast with our system are demonstrated.

ID GREENHOUSE GASES; CH4; CO2; RATIOS; FUEL
AB In recent years, cities in developing countries have become more and more reliant on natural gas as a clean energy source for transportation to reduce air pollution. In this study, we used street-level measurement of atmospheric CH4 and CO2 concentrations to quantify CH4 emissions from natural gas vehicles (NGVs) in China. These measurements were made in eight cities (Chengdu, Urumqi, Jinan, Nanjing, Lanzhou, Harbin, Guangzhou) with varying sizes of NGV fleet. A traffic CH4:CO2 emission ratio (TER) was determined via linear regression of CH4 versus CO2 concentration data obtained from each street transect. The TER value was combined with the ratio of NGVs in the street traffic in a mathematical model to obtain the CH4 emission factor for NGVs. Results show that the TER increases with increasing NGV ratio and decreases with increasing traffic speed. Overall, the NGV CH4 emission factor in these cities is 0.022 +/- 0.0033 kg m(-3), about 8 times the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) default factor for NGVs and is more than 100% higher than the mean NGV tailpipe emission factor found in the published literature. That the overall emission factor is much larger than the tailpipe emission factor indicates that on-road vehicle gas leakage is a widespread problem. A business-as-usual scenario suggests that NGVs may emit 1.23 Tg CH4 yr(-1) in 2030, or about 3% of China's current total anthropogenic emission. Our study suggest that curbing the emissions from this sector should be a high priority for global climate mitigation efforts.

AB This study examines the role of grid resolution on particulate nitrate predictions over the Eastern US during the summer using the three-dimensional chemical transport model (CTM) PMCAMx. The Base Case simulation with coarse resolution (36 x 36 km) often predicts high nighttime nitrate production rates thus leading to over prediction of aerosol nitrate levels. This overprediction is due to the artificial mixing of NOx-rich plumes from major point and area sources with the background atmosphere. Three different horizontal grid resolutions were tested (12 x 12 km, 4 x 4 km and telescoping 12x12/4 x 4 km) for parts of the northeastern US. The bias for PM2.5 nitrate decreased by 65% when the grid resolution was increased to 4 x 4 km. However, the remaining discrepancies between nitrate predictions and measurements indicate the need for additional improvements including better simulation of the total emissions of ammonia and their temporal evolution, improved description of nighttime chemistry and mixing etc.

AB Exploring the spatial distribution of air pollutants under future urban planning scenarios is essential as urban sprawl increases in China. However, existing published prediction models usually forecast pollutant concentrations at the station level or estimate spatial distribution of pollutant in a historical perspective. This study has developed a hybrid Grey-Markov/land use regression (LUR) model (GMLUR) for PM10 concentration prediction under future urban scenarios by employing the forecast of Grey-Markov model as surrogate measurements to calibrate the spatial estimations of LUR model. Taking the agglomeration of Changsha-Zhuzhou-Xiangtan (CZT) in China as a case, the superiority of GMLUR was tested and spatial distribution of PM10 concentrations based on four potential land use scenarios for the year 2020 were predicted. Results show that GMLUR modelling outperforms LUR modelling with clear lower average relative percentage error (5.13% vs. 24.09%) and root-mean-square error (5.50 mu g/m(3) vs. 21.31 mu g/m(3)). The economic interest scenario identifies the largest demands of future built-up (2 306.50 km(2)) and bare (34.88 km(2)) areas. Built-up area demands for the business as usual scenario, resource-conserving scenario, and ecological interest scenario are 362.67, 1 042.22, and 1 014.70 km(2), respectively. Correspondingly, the economic interest scenario identifies the severest PM10 pollution with the highest mean predicted concentration of 53.78 mu g/m(3) and the largest percent (19.43%) of area exceeding the Level 2 value (70 mu g/m(3)) of Chinese National Ambient Air Quality Standard (CNAAQS); these are significantly higher than those of the business as usual scenario (49.63 mu g/m(3), 6.28%). The resource-conserving scenario (46.79 mu g/m(3)) and ecological interest scenario (46.76 mu g/m(3)) are cleaner with no area exceeding the Level 2 value of CNAAQS. It can be concluded that GMLUR modelling provides a feasible way to evaluate the potential outcome of future urban planning strategies in the perspective of air pollution.

AB Due to the non-linear nature of ozone production in the troposphere, ozone production as a function of aviation nitrogen oxide (NOx = NO + NO2) emissions varies based on the background NOx levels. Of the several different sources of background NOx in the atmosphere, NOx from lightning (LNOx) contributes a substantial amount of NOx to the upper troposphere and has an effect on the ozone production efficiency, even though the LNOx source still has significant uncertainty. In this study, CAM5, the atmospheric component of the Community Earth System Model (CESM), was used to study the effect of uncertainties in NOx emissions from lightning on the production of aviation-induced ozone. Three sensitivity studies were analyzed with varying LNOx values of 3.7, 5, and 7.4 TgN/yr, representing the best current range estimates for LNOx. Results show a decrease in the aviation -induced ozone production rate and radiative forcing (RF) as LNOx increases. This is tied to the decreased ozone production under NOx saturated conditions. The ozone production per unit of NOx emission from lightning ranges from 2.38 TgO(3)/TgN for the case with 3.7 TgN from lightning to 0.97 TgO(3)/TgN for the case with 7.4 TgN from lightning. Similarly, the O-3 RF decreases from 43.9 mW/m2 for the 3.7 TgN/yr case to 34.3 mW/m2 for 7.4 TgN/yr case. Understanding the current sensitivity of aviation-induced ozone production to the LNOx strength is important for reducing the uncertainty in ozone production from aviation NOx emissions.

AB In Lebanon, the steady growth of aircraft movements at Beirut-Rafic Hariri International Airport (RHIA) and its geographical characteristics, signifies the necessity to assess the impact of Beirut airport on air quality. Up till now, no study has assessed the impact of Beirut-Rafic Hariri International Airport (RHIA) on the air quality of Beirut. Hence, we produce the first emissions inventory of Beirut airport activities (2012) - including emissions from aircraft landing and take-off (LTO) operations, ground support equipment, stationary sources, as well as airside and landside vehicles. This study, in which the first comprehensive emissions inventory in the Middle East region is conducted, provides a methodology to assess airport emissions in a country with no data. We estimated that in 2012, Beirut airport emitted 454.8 t of NOx, 50.7 t of NO2, 404.1 t of NO, and 24.4 t of VOCs. Results showed that aircraft emissions (Landing/Take-off cycle and auxiliary power units) dominate the airport emissions for NOx (91%), NO2 (92%), NO (91%), and VOCs (58%). Our emissions estimates will be used in identifying the contribution of Beirut airport emissions to national emissions and in order to assess the airport's compliance with environmental legislations and to assess mitigation options.

SO ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT

DE Asbestos; Urban area; Scanning electron microscopy; Airborne fibers
AB Assessment of airborne asbestos in urban areas of Tehran is important due to its potential health risks posed by a significant excess of current standards. Determination of airborne fibers can be performed using Phase Contrast Microscopy (PCM) as well as such a modem technique as Facade pane and its spectrum (SEM). Since PCM cannot differentiate asbestos and non-asbestos fibers, SEM is recommended to monitor the airborne asbestos content. The objective of this study was to determine asbestos fiber concentrations in ambient air in different areas of Tehran. Following the collection of samples using standard methods, we determined all fiber counts using PCM and asbestos fiber counts using SEM with X-ray diffraction microanalysis. The study results were then compared to the data related to the past six years obtained from the Air Quality Control Company (Iran) conducting annual airborne dust measurements in residential areas of Tehran using PCM. It should be noted that the scope of activities of the Air Quality Control Company did not include differentiation of asbestos from non-asbestos fibers.
   According to the results, all airborne fibrous particles sampled were either organic or mineral fibers, the appearance and specter of which were different from those of asbestos. Filter loading with mineral and organic fibers as well as soot particles from automobile exhausts indicated generally high ambient air pollution at all sampling sites. Optical and electron microscopy analyses of five dust samples collected from horizontal outdoor surfaces detected no asbestos fibers. We recommend regular monitoring of ambient air pollution in the streets of Tehran at different seasons of the year and establishing asbestos fiber concentrations using scanning electron microscopy for complete characterization of air pollution.

AB The Sagebrush experiment, led by NOAA's Field Research Division of the Air Resources Laboratory, consisted of five releases (intensive observation periods, or IOPs) of a chemically inert trace gas on five days in October 2013. All releases occurred in the afternoon under either near neutral stability conditions with high wind speeds or unstable conditions with low wind speeds. The sampling network for the tracer concentrations covered distances 200 m-3200 m from the release location and samples were obtained in 10-min averages. HYSPLIT, NOAA's transport and dispersion model, was used to simulate the spatial and temporal distribution of the tracer. The dispersion simulations were driven by WRF meteorological data with 27-km to 333-m grid spacing and using the inline and offline approaches as well as different planetary boundary layer schemes and a large-eddy simulation parameterization. Comparisons with measured wind speeds showed that none of the WRF PBL schemes or the large-eddy simulation parameterization was able to reproduce the rapid increase in high wind speeds observed during IOP3. The dispersion results were compared with the tracer measurements obtained during the experiment. The HYSPLIT dispersion simulations for IOP3, driven by the WRF data generated with various PBL schemes, showed greater concentration variability than the simulations performed for IOP5. The comparison between the inline and offline HYSPLIT simulations showed that the inline approach statistically outperformed the offline approach in three out of four IOPs because the tight coupling between the advection and dispersion processes implemented in the inline approach produced higher simulated concentrations close to the release location.

AB Particle number size distribution in a suburban Beijing was measured during the HOPE-J3A (Haze Observation Project Especially for Jing-Jin-Ji Area) field campaigns in 2015 from 18 June to 23 July (summer) and 2 to 25 December (winter). Average particle concentrations during the summer and winter campaigns were 9.6 +/- 4.8 x 10(3)cm(-3) and 13.9 +/- 8.3 x 10(3)cm(-3), respectively. Particle numbers were dominated by Aitken mode particles in both seasons. During the winter campaign, pollution events occurred every four to five days, each lasting for two to three days. In contrast, pollution events lasted for one to two days every six to seven days during the summer campaign. Aitken mode particles were 50% higher in the winter but new particle formation (NPF) events occurred more frequently in the summer. NPF events usually starts at around 10:00 LT (local time) in the summer but 12:00 LT in the winter. Aitken and accumulation mode particles accounted for 43.5% and 38.2% of all particles. The proportion of Aitken mode to total particles remained almost the same during summer, while it increased as haze intensified in winter. Particle number concentration was closely correlated with traffic and residents living activities and wind speed, with higher concentrations during rush hours, heating period and in the southerly wind. These results, when combined with trajectory cluster analysis, suggest that Aitken and accumulation mode particles were mainly from regional transport during the summer campaign, but from vehicle and coal-combustion emissions during the winter campaign.

AB While there is ample observational evidence for ozone uptake by Sahara dust, whether Asian dust exerts a similar effect on ozone has not been well-established in the literature due in part to limited observations. In this study we investigate the impacts of Asian dust on surface ozone (O-3) over northern China on a daily scale using observations from recently established air quality monitoring network during spring (March, April, May; MAM) 2015-2017, the peak season of Asian dust outbreaks. Dust days and non-dust days are selected based on the distribution of the coarse-mode particulate matter mass concentrations (PMcoarse) and then paired based on similar temperature (T) and relative humidity (RH) so as to minimize the effect of different local meteorological conditions on ozone. The majority of the dust days shows lower O-3 compared to non-dust days both temporally and spatially. The regional average of seasonal-mean O-3 differences between dust days and their reference non day days are -10.1 ppbv (-24.6%), -2.4 ppbv (-4.8%) and -5.4 ppbv (-14.3%) over the Taklimakan Desert (TD), the Gobi Desert (GD) and North China (NC), respectively. The decrease of ozone tends to increase with increasing PMcoarse, although the use of PMcoarse to indicate dust is subject to uncertainty. Nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfate dioxide (SO2), and carbon monoxide (CO) appear to be higher during dust days outside dust source regions, possibly because of the compounding effects of large anthropogenic emissions over this region. In spite of higher or similar levels of primary pollutants, surface ozone concentrations are still lower during dust days over TD, GD and NC, supporting the mechanism of dust direct uptake of O-3.

AB Organic tracer-based positive matrix factorization (PMF) was used to apportion fine particulate (PM2.5) organic carbon (OC) to its sources in Centreville, AL, USA, a rural forested site influenced by anthropogenic emissions, during the Southern Oxidant and Aerosol Study (SOAS) in the summer of 2013. Model inputs included organosulfates, a group of organic compounds that are tracers of anthropogenically-influenced biogenic secondary organic aerosols (SOA), as well as, OC, elemental carbon, water-soluble organic carbon, and other organic tracers for primary and secondary sources measured during day and night. The organic tracer-based PMF resolved eight factors that were identified as biomass burning (11%, average contribution to PM2.5 OC), vehicle emissions (8%), isoprene SOC formed under low-NOx conditions (13%), isoprene SOC formed under high-NOx conditions (11%), SOC formed by photochemical reactions (9%), oxidatively aged biogenic SOC (6%), sulfuric acid-influenced SOC (21%, that also includes isoprene and monoterpene SOC), and monoterpene SOC formed under high-NOx conditions (21%). These results indicate that OC in Centreville during summer is mainly secondary in origin (81%). Fossil fuel combustion is the major source of NOx, ozone, and sulfuric acid that play a key role in SOA formation in the southeastern US. Fossil fuel was found to influence 61-76% of OC through vehicle emissions and SOA formation. Together with prescribed burns, which were the major type of biomass burning during this study, the OC influenced by anthropogenic activities reached 87%. The organic tracer-based PMF results were further compared with two complementary source apportionment techniques: PMF factors resolved for submicron organic aerosols measured using aerosol mass spectrometry (AMS) by Xu et al. (2015a) in Centreville during SOAS; biomass burning organic aerosols (BBOA, 11% of OC), isoprene-derived organic aerosols (isoprene-OA, 20% of OC), more-oxidized oxygenated organic aerosols (MO-OOA, 34% of OC), and less oxidized oxygenated organic aerosols (LO-OOA, 35% of OC); and PM2.5 OC apportioned by chemical-mass balance model (CMB), considering the same chemical species as this study, save for organosulfates; biomass burning (5%), diesel engines (2%), gasoline smokers (3%), vegetative detritus (1%), isoprene SOC (23%) and monoterpene SOC (34%), and other (likely biogenic secondary) sources (33%). Overall, this study indicates the primary and secondary sources resolved by the organic tracer-based PMF are in good agreement with CMB and AMS-PMF results, while the organic tracer-based PMF provides additional insight to the SOC formation pathways through the inclusion of organosulfates and other organic tracers measured during day and night.

AB The aim of the present study is to evaluate experimentally the impact of a non-absorbing coating material on the spectral radiative properties of freshly produced carbonaceous aerosols. Once emitted into the atmosphere, carbonaceous particles are prone to interact with organic chemical compounds to acquire a certain amount of non-absorbing or weakly absorbing coating on their surface. In the present study, oleic acid is used as a surrogate for the coating material and applied to aerosols produced by a miniCAST (soot particles of different chemical and morphological properties) and a spark discharge aerosol generator. A simple analytical model is presented to evaluate the coating thickness. Furthermore, the spectrally resolved extinction cross sections of uncoated and coated particles are determined enabling the evaluation of the mass specific extinction coefficient and the extinction enhancement factor over a wide spectral range (200 - 1100nm). Influences of the coating thickness and the type of core carbonaceous particles are also discussed.

AB Background: Ischemic heart disease is a serious cause of death. Ambient particulate matter pollution is similarly defined a national environmental issue in China. The objective of this study was to examine the association of particulate matter with hospital admissions for ischemic heart disease in 26 large Chinese cities.
   Methods: The study identified 720,261 hospital admissions for ischemic heart disease by using electronic hospitalization summary reports from 1 January 2014 through 31 December 2015. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate the percent changes with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) in ischemic heart disease admissions in relation to an interquartile range increase in ambient particulate matter concentrations. We also assessed the effect modification of ischemic heart disease risk by geographical region, gender, and age.
   Results: The means of air pollutants were 63.5 +/- 50.6 mu g/m(3) for PM2.5, 106.8 +/- 71.9 mu g/m(3) for PIVIN. The levels of PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations in northern China were much higher than those in southern China. Both PM2.5 and PM10 had the strongest effect for daily ischemic heart disease admissions on lag 2 days, with an interquartile range (IQR) increase in PM2.5 (47.5 mu g/m(3)) and PM10 (76.9 mu g/m(3)) at lag 2 days corresponded to a 1.7% (95% CI, 1.5-1.9%) and 2.0% (95% CI, 1.7-2.3%) increase in ischemic heart disease admissions, respectively. Associations with both PM2.5 and PMic, were stronger in northern China than in southern China in all lag structures. In northern China, an IQR increase in PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations at lag 2 days was associated with a 1.8% (95% CI, 1.6-2.1%) and 2.1% (95% CI, 1.8-2.4%) increase in ischemic heart disease admissions, respectively. In southern China, negative associations were observed with PM2.5 and with PM10 almost at all lag structures.
   Conclusion: Short-term elevations in the levels of PM2.5 and PM10 demonstrate significant associations with an increase in ischemic heart disease. In northern China, the associations between the increase of PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations and IHD admissions were positive. In southern China, the associations were null or negative.

AB Evidence of combined mortality effects of multi-pollutant on cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and the corresponding exposure-response (ER) relationship is limited. In this paper, we examined the association between four ambient air pollutants (i.e., fine particulate matter, PM2.5, particulate matter, PM10, nitrogen dioxide, NO2, and sulfur dioxide, SO2.) and CVD mortality and the corresponding ER relationship after incorporating the potential interaction among the multiple pollutants. Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) was used to evaluate the ER relationship and to explore the interactions between pollutants. The results showed that PMio and SO2 were dominant pollutants from 0 to 2 days, while PM2.5 and NO2 had strong effect on CVD mortality from 3 to 4 days. Generally, PM2.5 and NO2 had the similar ER relationship across different moving average concerning the CVD mortality. For the interaction among the multiple pollutants, we found that there is no interaction between partide pollutants (i.e. PM2.5 and PM10) and gaseous pollutants (i.e.NO2 and SO2). On the contrary, there might be an interaction between PM2.5 and PM10 though this interaction was detected by visually comparing the slopes of ER curves of a given particle pollutant at different levels of the other particle pollutant. But there is a lack of statistical significance test for this interaction. This study suggests that different ambient air pollutants might have the dominant effect on CVD deaths during different moving average, though there might not be statistical significant interactions among the ambient air pollutants in present study.

AB Acetaldehyde (CH3CHO) is a key player of atmospheric chemistry, an important air pollutant, and hence a major target of air quality modeling and management. The Regional Atmospheric Chemistry Mechanism (RACM) is a highly lumped gas-phase chemical mechanism that has been widely applied in atmospheric chemistry modeling studies. A significant update of the latest version of RACM (RACM2) is the addition of CH3CHO as an explicit aldehyde species, facilitating the direct simulation of CH3CHO. In this study, we compared the performances of RACM2 and Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM; v3.3.1) on the simulation of CH3CHO. Zero-dimensional chemical box models based on these two independent mechanisms were prescribed to a polluted scenario to simulate the evolution of ozone (O-3), hydroxyl radical (OH), C2H5O2 (ETHP) and CH3CHO, as well as their detailed chemical budgets. Overall, both mechanisms agreed with the simulation of O-3 and OH, but the RACM2 model simulated significantly higher levels of ETHP and CH3CHO than the MCM model. The difference in the chemical kinetic data in both mechanisms is not the reason for this discrepancy. The oversimplification of the lumped peroxy acyl radicals (RCO3) and >= C3 aldehydes chemistry of RACM2 should be responsible for its higher simulated ETHP and CH3CHO. We caution the use of RACM2 or any other highly aggregated chemical mechanism for the simulation of C2H5O2 and CH3CHO. Better methods are needed to represent the chemistry of peroxy acyl radicals and >= C3 aldehydes for aggregated chemical mechanisms. More experiments are required to directly validate and further improve the current chemistry mechanisms.

AB Air pollution has become one of the most stubborn environmental problem in China, the traditional environmental monitoring mainly focus on the horizontal distribution of the pollutants, while it is still of great importance to have the knowledge of the vertical profiles of them. The present study, for the first time, attempted to acquire the vertical distributions of O-3 and one of its precursors, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) within 1000 m of lower troposphere by using a tethered balloon in the suburban of Shanghai, a Chinese megacity. We analyze the concentration and the ozone formation potential (OFP) at three height level of 50-350, 350-700, and 700-1000 m. According to our measurement, the total concentration of VOC decreased with the altitude increasing. In addition, the dominant species of OFP was alkene, aromatics, and alkene at height level of 50-350, 350-700 and 700-1000 m, respectively. Our results suggest that, in the morning, the fresh emission contributed a lot to the high concentration of benzene and toluene near ground. Furthermore, the regression analyzes showed toluene decreased faster than benzene in the troposphere. The VOC concentration can be used as initial values for numerical simulations of chemical reaction in the lower troposphere.

AB Urbanization, population and economic growth in Indian megacities like Delhi have resulted in an increase in energy and transportation demand leading to severe air pollution and related health impacts, as well as to the rapid growth in the greenhouse gas emissions. In this study, an integrated assessment of air quality and climate policies for Indian cities-with a particular focus on National Capital Territory of Delhi, has been carried out. We have developed emission inventory of air pollutants and greenhouse gases for the base year (2010) and evaluated the impact of current policies on emission projections by 2030 in the business-as-usual scenario. Emissions of coarse and fine particulate matter are projected to be 51% and 15% higher in 2030 as compared to present. As the current legislations do not indicate progress towards the achievement of the Indian National Ambient Air Quality Standards in Delhi, we explored the effectiveness of additional emission control strategies with either advanced end-of-pipe emission controls or low carbon policies. Relative to the baseline scenario, the set of alternative policy strategies would reduce emissions rapidly in 2030. The results revealed that air quality policies under various scenarios could also have co-benefits of reducing carbon emissions. At the same time, the results suggest that low carbon policies would be more efficient to cut emissions as compared to advanced end-of-pipe emission control policies. However, their implementation could be limited by the availability of clean fuels. In the climate policy scenario, carbon emission in 2030 is estimated to decrease by 19% relative to baseline. Additional controls combined with low carbon policies like controlling non-industrial emissions create an opportunity to further enhance the scope for co-benefits and to attain the air quality standards in Delhi.

AB Particulate matter smaller than 2.5 mu m (referred to as PM2.5) is the most important criteria pollutant impacting human health, environment and climate. India is already recognized as pollution hotspot where PM2.5 has been increasing in the recent past. Here we project anthropogenic PM2.5 for the near future (till 2040) over India using multiple linear regression (MLR) approach based on RegCM projected meteorology and ECLIPSE projected emission. MISR derived PM2.5 concentration (mu g/m(3)) for the year 2010-2012 has been used to train the MLR model with reasonable accuracy (R > 0.9). The impact of the meteorological parameters under both RCP4.5 and 8.5 scenarios partially negates the impact of rising emission in future; more so in RCP8.5 than in RCP4.5 scenario. Air quality is projected to improve significantly with short lived climate pollutant (SLCP) 'mitigation' scenario in comparison with current legislation (CLE) baseline emission scenario. Spatial analysis identifies a rapid increase in anthropogenic PM2.5 in the eastern Indian states of Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Odisha, Peninsular India, and Delhi National Capital Region. Our results identify the near future pollution hotspots that would be useful in air quality management planning for the near future.

AB Over a period of eight years, were assessed the main types of airborne pollen in Mexico City (a tropical region). We established the airborne pollen calendar and we evaluated the associations between aeroallergens and allergic diseases in children treated at hospitals. A Hirst-type volumetric spore trap was placed in an open area within the Chapultepec Forest, and pollen records were obtained during the flowering period of the plants. A total of 502 patients between 1 and 17 years old were evaluated. The patients were diagnosed by skin testing with extracts of tree pollen, grass and weeds. During the monitoring period, the airborne pollen grains were dominated by trees (Fraxinus, Cupressaceae, Alnus, Quercus) followed by Poaceae, with the highest average values detected between January and February. Children with positive reactions to pollen aeroallergens were diagnosed with allergic diseases. The predominant airborne allergens were determined. An airborne pollen calendar was established. A close association was found between the most frequent and abundant pollen types and the responses of children produced by exposure to pollen grains. Children with positive reactions to pollen were diagnosed with allergic conjunctivitis, allergic rhinitis, asthma and keratoconjunctivitis.

AB It has been shown that the short-lived halogenated hydrocarbons, such as dichloromethane (DCM), which are not regulated by the Montreal Protocol, have the potential to impact stratospheric ozone. DCM with increasing atmospheric mixing ratios in recent years, is widely used in solvent, foam-blowing and methyl fluoride production sectors in China, which is a large producer as well as consumer of DCM. This study develops a comprehensive emission inventory of anthropogenic DCM in China using a bottom-up method based on the industrial consumption of DCM in China from 2005 to 2016 and makes a projection to 2030. The inventory considered solvent use, polyurethane (PU) foam manufacturing, the chemical industry, and other end uses. Anthropogenic emissions of DCM increased from 101 (80-122) Gg/yr to 318 (254-384) Gg/yr between 2005 and 2016, a increase of 215% over the last 11 years. Solvent use and the manufacture of PU foam agents are the major contributors to total DCM emissions. Under a business as usual (BAU) scenario future Chinese emissions of DCM are predicted to increase to 708 (588-831) Gg/yr by 2030, more than twice the emission IHS, 2016. Chinese emission account for approximately 25%-37% of the 515 Gg/yr estimates by the WMO as average annual global emissions in 2008.

AB Particle number size distributions are among the most important parameters in trying to understand the characteristics of particle population. Atmospheric particles were measured in an interaction of mixed environments in the Southeastern coastal city of Wollongong, Australia, during a comprehensive field campaign known as Measurements of Urban, Marine and Biogenic Air (MUMBA). MUMBA ran in summer season between 21st December 2012 and 15th February 2013. Particle number concentrations measured during this campaign were indicative of the interplay between marine environments and urban air which met the objective of this campaign. Particle number size distributions ranging from 14 nm to 660 nm in diameter:, as measured by Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS) in this study, were grouped using Principal Component Analysis. Based on strong component loadings (value >= 0.75), three different factors were identified (i) Small Factor (Ns): 15 nm < Dp < 50 nm, (ii) Medium Factor (NM): 60 nm < Dp < 150 nm and (iii) Large Factor (NL): 210 nm < Dp < 450 nm. The three factors describe 89% of the dataset cumulative variance. Particles in this region are dependent upon the interaction between the sources, and cannot be viewed as a simple mixture of biogenic and anthropogenic sources associated with various mechanical processes. The particles observed in the morning were found to be influenced by combustion emissions, presumably primarily from traffic, which is most obvious in N. The particle population during the day was found to be influenced by a mixture of marine sources and secondary aerosols production initiated by photochemical oxidation. The local steel works and the urban environment were the major contributors of particles at night. Secondary organic aerosols were identified in this study by the mass ratio of organic carbon to elemental carbon (OC/EC). Biogenic sources influenced secondary organic aerosols formation as a moderate correlation (R-2 = 0.6) was observed between secondary organic aerosols mass and biogenic isoprene. The processes described in this paper are likely repeated at other coastal urban environments worldwide.

AB Water soluble organic carbon (WSOC) can significantly influence the aerosol optical properties and the aqueous phase chemistry in cloudwater, fogwater and aerosol liquid water. Here, we examine how the changing pH (in acidic range) affects the absorption spectra of aqueous extracts from field biomass burning aerosols, under dark conditions and in presence of simulated sunlight illumination. The observation under dark conditions indicates that pH variation from 2 to 5 induces significantly enhanced light absorbance in the wavelength ranges of 235-270 nm and 300-550 nm, whereas the light absorbance decreased in the range of 270-300 nm, which might be partially ascribed to the deprotonation of carboxylic acids and phenols. During the extract photolysis, light absorption exhibits photo-bleaching below 380 nm and photo-enhancement above 380 nm, indicating that at acidic levels (pH = 2-5), the particle extracts could undergo a significant composition evolution leading to a modification of absorptive properties. Meanwhile, after 12 h-photolysis, the acidity ([H+]) normalized by WSOC concentration in aqueous extracts ([WSOCae]) increased with a variation of Delta[11(+)]/[WSOCae] = (3.7 +/- 0.7) x 10(-7) mol mgC(-1) (mean +/- standard deviation), suggesting the formation of new acidic substances. Although these findings were acquired in aqueous solutions more relevant to cloud and fog water, the similar evolution likely occurs in wetted aerosols. This calls more attention to the effect of acidity on the wetted aerosols in order to better estimate the aerosol radiative forcing.

AB Lately, black carbon (BC) has received significant attention due to its climate-warming properties and adverse health effects. Nevertheless, long-term observations in urban areas are scarce, most likely because BC monitoring is not required by environmental legislation. This, however, handicaps the evaluation of air quality models which can be used to assess the effectiveness of policy measures which aim to reduce BC concentrations.
   Here, we present a new dataset of atmospheric BC measurements from Germany constructed from over six million measurements at over 170 stations. Data covering the period between 1994 and 2014 were collected from twelve German Federal States and the Federal Environment Agency, quality checked and harmonized into a database with comprehensive metadata. The final data in original time resolution are available for download (https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.881173) . Though assembled in a consistent way, the dataset is characterized by differences in (a) measurement methodologies for determining evolved carbon and optical absorption, (b) covered time periods, and (c) temporal resolutions that ranged from half hourly to measurements every 6th day. Usage and interpretation of this dataset thus requires a careful consideration of these differences.
   Our analysis focuses on 2009, the year with the largest data coverage with one single methodology, as well as on the relative changes in long-term trends over ten years. For 2009, we find that BC concentrations at traffic sites were at least twice as high as at urban background, industrial and rural sites. Weekly cycles are most prominent at traffic stations, however, the presence of differences in concentrations during the week and on weekends at other station types suggests that traffic plays an important role throughout the full network. Generally higher concentrations and weaker weekly cycles during the winter months point towards the influence of other sources such as domestic heating. Regarding the long-term trends, advanced statistical techniques allow us to account for instrumentation changes and to separate seasonal and long-term changes in our dataset. Analysis shows a downward trend in BC at nearly all locations and in all conditions, with a high level of confidence for the period of 2005-2014. In depth analysis indicates that background BC is decreasing slowly, while the occurrences of high concentrations are decreasing more rapidly.
   In summary, legislation - both in Europe and locally - to reduce particulate emissions and indirectly BC appear to be working, based on this analysis. Adverse human health and climate impacts are likely to be diminished because of the improvements in air quality.

AB South Africa (SA) is influenced by anthropogenic SO2 emissions, however, no studies exist detailing the atmospheric or climatic effects resulting from volcanic eruptions at this location. In this work, the Calbuco volcano situated in southern Chile (41.79 degrees S, 73.13 degrees W), was used as a case study to investigate the transport of volcanic SO2 plumes over SA in 2015. The Calbuco volcano underwent a series of eruptive phases starting from 22 April 2015. In this study, HYSPLIT forward trajectories and cluster analysis were carried out in order to estimate the altitude level of air parcels entering the SA subcontinent. These analyses along with Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) assessments confirmed that trajectories beginning in Calbuco arrived in SA during the last few days of April (similar to 28 April 2015) and stayed until the 1st week of May 2015 (similar to 2 May 2015). In order to estimate the rise in SO2 columnar concentrations at various altitudes and surface SO2 levels, OMI data and 19 ground-based (GB) monitoring stations (situated throughout SA) were utilized. A comparative analysis employing SO2 data from pre-2014 and post-2016 volcanic eruption periods were also included in this study. Results showed that a major increase in SO2 concentration was observed at the Planetary Boundary Layer (similar to 2 DU) when compared to its upper layers during April and May 2015. Although some GB stations in North West province namely Damonsville, Mmabatho and Phola showed a moderate increase in SO2 values during April and May 2015, there was no significant rise in GB measurements at the surface in other locations However, we are not certain due to data gaps in the measurements and non-availability of ground-based measurements.

AB Carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes from six winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) paddocks (grain only, graze-grain, and graze-out) managed under conventional till (CT) and no-till (NT) systems were synthesized for the 2016-2017 growing season to compare the magnitudes and seasonal dynamics of CO2 fluxes and to investigate among-site variability of CO2 fluxes. Large variations in CO2 fluxes were observed among paddocks. Maximum daily (7-day averages) net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) ranged from - 3.39 to - 8.68 g C m(-2), gross primary production (GPP) ranged from 7.33 to 16.92 g C m(-2), and ecosystem respiration (ER) ranged from 5.85 to 9.98 g C m(-2). Seasonal sums of NEE ranged from -137 to -542 g C m(-2). Optimum photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), air temperature (T-a), and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) for NEE were approximately 1700 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), 22 degrees C, and 1.25 kPa, respectively. Across-site analysis showed percent of canopy cover (Canopy%) was strongly correlated with NEE (R-2 = 0.76) and ecosystem light use efficiency (ELUE, R-2 = 0.76). Integration of PAR with leaf area index (LAI) and integration of T-a with dry biomass weight (DW) explained 81% and 74% of variations in GPP and ER, respectively. Remotely-sensed enhanced vegetation index (EVI) explained 66% and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) explained 69% of the variations in NEE. Integration of PAR with NDVI or EVI explained similar to 80% of variations in GPP, while NDVI x T-a explained 58% of variations in ER. Results illustrated that differences in wheat canopies related to paddock management, as indicated by differences in DW, LAI, Canopy%, NDVI, and EVI, must be accounted for explaining among-site variability of CO2 fluxes. Long-term measurements from our clustered and paired eddy covariance towers will provide insights into the effects of tillage and different grazing practices on CO2 dynamics in winter wheat.

AB This short communication investigated the characteristics and sources of refractory black carbon (rBC) aerosols using an Aerodyne soot-particle aerosol mass spectrometer (SP-AMS). The SP-AMS dataset acquired at suburban Nanjing observed carbon clusters (C-n(+) ) up to n = 160, which was classified into three groups (low-C: C-1(+)-C-5 mid-C: C-6(+)-C-31(+); full-C (fullerenes): C-32(+)-C-160(+)). A simple method was first developed to reduce influences of organic molecules on the C-n(+) signals. We found that the temporal variations of low-C and mid-C varied similarly, but were substantially different from full-C, indicating different source contributions. Furthermore, positive matrix factorization analyses showed that the C-1(+)/C-3(+) ratios of traffic-, industry-, cooking-related rBC were 0.88, 1.29 and 0.01, respectively. We propose such C-1(+)/C-3(+) ratios can be used as references to distinguish different sources for rBC in ambient conditions, yet further verifications with more field data are still required, and whether or not such ratios in rBC cores are stable upon atmospheric ageing remains to be elucidated.

AB To understand the impacts of wood vinegar (WV), a by product of biochar production, on N2O and CH4 emissions and their total global warming potential (GWP(t)) from N-fertilized rice paddy soil, a soil column experiment was conducted using three treatments: 240 kg urea-N ha(-1) accompanied with 0, 5, and 10t WV ha(-1), respectively. Results showed that N2O and CH4 emission flux patterns were dominated by water regime of rice growth cycle, which was independent with WV application. The total N2O, CH4 emission loads and GWP(t) over rice season of three N received treatments were 6.41-8.85 kg ha(-1), 127.7-405.0 kg ha(-1), and 5.24-12.03 t CO2-e ha(-1) , respectively. Rice seasonal N2O and CH4 emissions were synchronously mitigated by 22.4% and 36.4%, respectively, when WV was applied at 5 t ha(-1). Consequently, 5 t ha(-1) WV treatment reduced 31.5% of GWP(t) compared with the urea treatment. In addition, 10 t ha(-1) WV treatment exerted a more positive effect on suppressing N2O with 27.6% reduction. However, it increased GWP(t) by 57.2% because its CH4 emission load was increased by 101.8%. In conclusion, WV amendment applied at an appropriate rate (5 t ha(-1)) or combination with other CH4 control technologies were suggested to reduce both N2O and CH4 emissions and thereby the GWP(t) in N-fertilized rice paddy soil.

AB Human activities have increased atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition, in turn changing CO2 emissions. Many studies concentrated on the relationships between the amount of N deposition and CO2 emissions. However, how N forms affect CO2 emissions is still poorly understood. A two-year field experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of N forms on CO 2 emissions in the coastal wetlands of the Yellow River Delta. The N forms consisted of nitrate (NaNO3), ammonium (NH4Cl) and organic N (urea-N: glycin-N = 1: 1), and the level of N addition was 8 g N M-2 yr(-1) . The CO2 emissions were measured in the growing season from April to October. The results showed that three types of N addition stimulated CO2 emissions (P < 0.05). Compared with the control treatment, nitrate, ammonium and organic N additions increased CO2 emissions by 23.24%, 32.92% and 49.02%, respectively. Nitrate and ammonium additions produced similar and positive effects on CO2 emissions, whereas organic N addition had larger and positive effects on CO2 emissions than those of inorganic N addition (P < 0.05). This may be attributed to the following reasons. First, three types of N addition tended to increase soil 0-glucosidase activity and Q(10) value of CO2 emissions, but only organic N addition significantly enhanced soil -glucosidase activity and Q(10) value (P < 0.05). Second, inorganic N addition had neutral and negative effects on the decomposition of soil organic carbon (SOC), whereas organic N addition increased SOC decomposition compared with control treatment (P < 0.05). Together, these findings highlight the significance of differentiating the influences of N forms on CO2 emissions.

AB Upon the effect of atmospheric stability on air pollution, this study highlights the weakened diurnal evolution of atmospheric boundary layer (ABL), which is crucial to the formation of regional fog-haze and air pollution episodes over eastern China (ECN). The decrease of atmospheric visibility (Vis) during 1973-2012 is found to be related to the more stable ABL with weakened diurnal evolution that is characterized by a concurrent weakening of surface wind, a decrease in ABL height, and a reduction of diurnal temperature range (DTR, - 0.26 and - 0.092 degrees C/10-years in the winter and summer, respectively). With a general synchronous variation, the increase in both aerosol loading and cloud cover might work in concert to reduce solar radiation reaching the surface, stabilize ABL and weaken the diurnal ABL evolution, thereby weakening the turbulent mixing of pollutants and enhancing air pollution. This conjecture of "aerosol, cloud - ABL - air pollution" feedback, with particular emphasis on the effect of cloud (in addition to the effect of aerosol) on the ABL evolution, is supported by our analysis of 40 years trends in the cloud, Vis and DTR from surface observation, the aerosol optical depth from MODIS, and the validated MERRA-2 reanalysis aerosol, cloud and boundary layer height (by surface observation and routine radiosonde sounding). Regarding the linkage between fog-haze and diurnal evolution of the ABL, the result emphasizes the effect of a persistent high relative humidity (RH), which is found to be important to the formation of regional persistent fog-haze episodes and must be carefully considered in future study. Therefore, a chain of processes is suggested to interpret the occurrence of regional persistent fog-haze episodes over ECN. First, during a polluted day, because of aerosol radiative effects, the high ABL stability and high RH can persist throughout the day, and consequently, favoring the accumulation of pollutants as well as the secondary formation and hygroscopic growth of aerosol. Second, the maintenance of such more stable, humid and polluted ABL is in contrast to a clear day when the ABL is more convective in the afternoon and facilitates the diffusion and dilution of pollutants. Third, under a persistent stable synoptic system, the increase of air pollution associated with the weakened diurnal evolution of ABL due to the "aerosol, cloud - ABL - air pollution" feedback, as described above, can be further strengthened, thereby renders more persistent and severe air pollution events. The DTR variation in relationship with the aerosol, cloud, ABL and air pollution is also discussed.

AB Household solid fuel combustion for heating and cooking in rural areas is an important source of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in northwestern China, which largely contributes to PM2.5 personal exposure concentrations during the cold winter. There is a general lack of understanding about the personal exposure to PM2.5 and to its chemical components emitted from domestic solid fuel combustion in northwestern Chinese rural populations. In this work, personal exposure to PM2.5 was sampled using a portative device together with fixed indoor and outdoor fixed samplings in Guanzhong Plain in December 2016 for the purpose of characterizing personal exposure to PM2.5 as a function of different solid fuels used in rural households. The average housewife's personal exposure to PM2.5 concentration was 263.4 +/- 105.8 mu g m(-3) (1 sigma, n = 30), which was about 40% higher than the values found indoors (186.5 +/- 79.5 mu g m(-3), l sigma, n = 30) and outdoors (191.0 +/- 85.3 mu g m(-3), l sigma, n = 30). High personal exposure PM2.5 levels were mainly related to the ignition of solid fuels for heating and cooking. Correlations among personal exposure, indoor and outdoor PM2.5 levels and their mutual ratios were computed to investigate how personal exposure to fine aerosols can be related to microenvironmental PM2.5 levels and to individual activities. The results showed that households using electric power for heating and cooking were characterized by an average personal exposure PM2.5 value of 156.8 +/- 36.6 mu g m(-3) (l sigma, n = 6) while personal exposure to PM2.5 in households using solid fuels was twice higher (310.8 +/- 90.4 mu g m(-3), l sigma, n = 24). Solid fuel combustion products and related secondary formed species dominated PM2.5 mass in personal exposure, indoor and outdoor samples. Motor vehicle emission and various dust sources were two other main contributors identified. Our results demonstrated that the use of clean energy could be an effective measure to reduce personal exposure levels of PM2.5 emitted from domestic solid fuels combustion in winter in rural areas, which implied that the government should speed up the upgrade of the heating and cooking equipment fleet to protect the health of rural residents in northwestern China.

AB Complex spatial and temporal patterns of ground-level O-3 and NO2 concentrations have been revealed across an important southern European O-3 exceedance area (Madrid Basin, central Spain). Data were obtained from 102 diffusion tube sites and 49 monitoring stations (25 urban/suburban, 12 urban/suburban-traffic, 7 remote, 3 rural, 2 urban-industrial) located through a wide area inside and beyond the city. This new, high-density database confirms that current locations of monitoring stations in the Madrid networks are well positioned to record representative levels of O-3 across the area. Two air quality monitoring stations were identified as reference measurement points, based on their lower O-3 and NO2 concentrations, and used as a proxy for regional and hemispheric background levels. Although a main regional contribution was evidenced, emissions of local precursors within the Madrid urban plume play a key role in the generation of O-3 exceedances, which are higher and occur earlier near the city than at rural sites, where the effect of NO titration is lower. Despite the fact that weekend emissions of O-3 precursors in Madrid are typically lower than on weekdays, mainly due to fewer road traffic emissions, there is little difference in average values of weekday and weekend O-3. However, more subtle "weekend effect" differences are revealed by probability density analysis, with high O-3 and low NO2 at the highest temperature range (30-35 degrees C) at weekends reflecting lower NO titration. This analysis highlights the importance of NO timing with respect to the photochemical activity timing. The complexity of these O-3 pollution patterns in and around the city is dependent on an ever-changing interplay between weather conditions, emission sources, and the timescale required for pollutant transport, chemical processing and recirculation in an evolving contaminated airmass.

AB Stable carbon isotopes provide information on aerosol sources, but no extensive long-term studies of these isotopes have been conducted in China, and they have mainly been used for qualitative rather than quantitative purposes. Here, 24 h PM2.5 samples (n = 58) were collected from July 2008 to June 2009 at Xi'an, China. The concentrations of organic and elemental carbon (OC and EC), water-soluble OC, and the stable carbon isotope abundances of OC and EC were determined. In spring, summer, autumn and winter, the mean stable carbon isotope in OC (delta C-13(oc)) were - 26.4 +/- 0.6, - 25.8 +/- 0.7, 25.0 .+/- 0.6 and - 24.4 +/- 0.8%o, respectively, and the corresponding delta C-13(EC) values were - 25.5 +/- 0.4, - 25.5 +/- 0.8, - 25.2 +/- 0.7 and - 23.7 +/- 0.6%o. Large delta(13) C-EC and delta C-13(oc) values in winter can be linked to the burning coal for residential heating. Less biomass is burned during spring and summer than winter or fall (manifested in the levels of levoglucosan, i.e., 178, 85, 370, 935 ng m(-3) in spring, summer, autumn, and winter), and the more negative delta C-13 (oc) in the warmer months can be explained by the formation of secondary organic aerosols. A levoglucosan tracer method combined with an isotope mass balance analysis indicated that biomass burning accounted for 1.6-29.0% of the EC, and the mean value in winter (14.9 +/- 7.5%) was 7 times higher than summer (2.1 +/- 0.4%), with intermediate values of 6.1 +/- 5.6 and 4.5 +/- 2.4% in autumn and spring. Coal combustion accounted for 45.9 +/- 23.1% of the EC overall, and the percentages were 63.0, 37.2, 36.7, and 33.7% in winter, autumn, summer and spring respectively. Motor vehicles accounted for 46.6 +/- 26.5% of the annual EC, and these contributed over half (56.7-61.8%) of the EC in all seasons except winter. Correlations between motor vehicle-EC and coal combustion-EC with established source indicators (B(ghi)P and As) support the source apportionment results. This paper describes a simple and accurate method for apportioning the sources of EC, and the results may be beneficial for developing model simulations as well as controlling strategies in future.

AB Sulfur dioxide emissions from the Kilauea Volcano on the island of Hawai'i and the subsequent formation of sulfate aerosols have caused a public health hazard across the state of Hawaii since the volcano began erupting continuously in 1983. The University of Hawaii at Manoa began to forecast the trajectory and dispersion of emissions in 2010 to help mitigate the hazards to public health. In this paper a comprehensive review of potential conversion reactions is presented with the goal of more accurately representing the sulfur dioxide chemistry in the dispersion model.
   Atmospheric sulfur dioxide chemistry and major process responsible for sulfate formation are well documented in urban and industrial settings. The atmosphere in the vicinity of Kilauea Volcano on the island of Hawaii differs from that in previous investigations by virtue of being far removed from both urban and industrial settings in a remote, tropical marine atmosphere. Additionally, the combination of the high rate of sulfur dioxide emissions and trace gases and metals from Kilauea Volcano creates a unique circumstance that requires a new look at potential conversion pathways to determine the dominant reactions.
   The theoretical analysis suggests that the dominant reaction in clear air will be between sulfur dioxide and the hydroxyl radical (0.01-5% h(-1)) and the dominant reaction in cloudy air involves hydrogen peroxide (3-50% s(-1)). Moreover, given the high SO2 emissions from the Halema'urna'u Crater vent, the oxidation of sulfur dioxide by these reactants is limited by their rate of production.

AB In the past decade, due to the management policies and coal combustion controls in Beijing, the consumption of natural gas has increased gradually. Nevertheless, the research on the emission characteristics of gaseous pollutants emitted from gas-fired industrial boilers, especially considering the influence of low nitrogen (low-NOx) retrofit policy of gas boilers, is scarcely. In this study, based on literature and field investigations, onsite measurements of NOx, CO, NH3 and VOCs (Volatile Organic Compounds) emissions from gas-fired industrial boilers as well as the key factors that affected the emission of gaseous pollutants were discussed. Category-specific emission factors (EFs) of NOx, CO, NH3 and VOCs were obtained from the field measurements of 1107 "low-NOx" retrofitted and unabated gas-fired industrial boilers. Our results showed that operating load and control measures were the two key factors affecting the formation of gaseous pollutants. The EFs of NOx (EFNOX and CO (EFCO) of atmospheric combustion boilers (ACBs) were much higher than the EFs of chamber combustion boilers (CCBs). The total emissions of NOx, CO, NH3 and VOCs from gas-fired industrial boilers in Beijing in the year of 2015 were estimated at 10489.6 t, 3272.8 t, 196.4 t and 235.4 t, respectively. Alkanes, BTEX, oxygenated VOCs and non-reactive organic matter were the four main chemical components of VOCs. As for the spatial distributions, the emissions of NOx, CO, NH3 and VOCs from gas-fired industrial boilers in Beijing were predominantly concentrated in central six urban districts. In the future, more detailed investigation and field tests for all kinds of gas-fired industrial boilers are still greatly needed to achieve more reliable estimations of atmospheric pollutants from gas-fired industrial boilers.

AB The increased availability and improved quality of new sensing technologies have catalyzed a growing body of research to evaluate and leverage these tools in order to quantify and describe urban environments. Air quality, in particular, has received greater attention because of the well-established links to serious respiratory illnesses and the unprecedented levels of air pollution in developed and developing countries and cities around the world. Though numerous laboratory and field evaluation studies have begun to explore the use and potential of low-cost air quality monitoring devices, the performance and stability of these tools has not been adequately evaluated in complex urban environments, and further research is needed. In this study, we present the design of a low-cost air quality monitoring platform based on the Shinyei PPD42 aerosol monitor and examine the suitability of the sensor for deployment in a dense heterogeneous urban environment. We assess the sensor's performance during a field calibration campaign from February 7th to March 25th 2017 with a reference instrument in New York City, and present a novel calibration approach using a machine learning method that incorporates publicly available meteorological data in order to improve overall sensor performance. We find that while the PPD42 performs well in relation to the reference instrument using linear regression (R-2 = 0.36-0.51), a gradient boosting regression tree model can significantly improve device calibration (R-2 = 0.68-0.76). We discuss the sensor's performance and reliability when deployed in a dense, heterogeneous urban environment during a period of significant variation in weather conditions, and important considerations when using machine learning techniques to improve the performance of low-cost air quality monitors.

AB Speciated mercury gridded emissions inventories together with chemical transport models and concentration measurements are essential when investigating both the effectiveness of mitigation measures and the mercury cycle in the environment. Since different mercury species have contrasting behaviour in the atmosphere, their proportion in anthropogenic emissions could determine the spatial impacts. In this study, the time series from 1970 to 2012 of the EDGARv4.tox2 global mercury emissions inventory are described; the total global mercury emission in 2010 is 1772 tonnes. Global grid-maps with geospatial distribution of mercury emissions at a 0.1 degrees x 0.1 degrees resolution are provided for each year. Compared to the previous tox1 version, tox2 provides updates for more recent years and improved emissions in particular for agricultural waste burning, power generation and artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) sectors. We have also developed three retrospective emissions scenarios based on different hypotheses related to the proportion of mercury species in the total mercury emissions for each activity sector; improvements in emissions speciation are seen when using information primarily from field measurements. We evaluated them using the GEOS-Chem 3-D mercury model in order to explore the influence of speciation shifts, to reactive mercury forms in particular, on regional wet deposition patterns. The reference scenario S1 (EDGARv4.tox2 S1) uses speciation factors from the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP); scenario S2 ("EPA_power") uses factors from EPA's Information Collection Request (ICR); and scenario S3 ("Asia_filedM") factors from recent scientific publications. In the reference scenario, the sum of reactive mercury emissions (Hg-P and Hg2+) accounted for 25.3% of the total global emissions; the regions/countries that have shares of reactive mercury emissions higher than 6% in total global reactive mercury are China + (30.9%), India + (12.5%) and the United States (9.9%). In 2010, the variations of reactive mercury emissions amongst the different scenarios are in the range of -19.3 t/yr (China +) to 4.4 t/yr (OECD_Europe). However, at the sector level, the variation could be different, e.g., for the iron and steel industry in China reaches 15.4 t/yr. Model evaluation at the global level shows a variation of approximately +/- 10% in wet deposition for the three emissions scenarios. An evaluation of the impact of mercury speciation within nested grid sensitivity simulations is performed for the United States and modelled wet deposition fluxes are compared with measurements. These studies show that using the S2 and S3 emissions of reactive mercury, can improve wet deposition estimates near sources.

AB Temporal variations of vehicle emissions are affected by various compounding factors in the real world. The focus of this study is to determine the effects of ambient conditions and post-tailpipe changes on traffic emissions measured in the near-road region. Emission factors allowed for the isolation of the traffic signal and accounted for effects of local meteorology and dilution. Five month-long measurement campaigns were conducted at an urban near-road site that exhibited a broad range of ambient conditions with temperatures ranging between -18 and + 30 degrees C. Particle number emission factors were 2.0 x higher in the winter relative to the summer, which was attributed to changes in particles post-tailpipe. Conversely, toluene emissions were 2.5 x higher in the summer relative to the winter, attributed to changes in fuel composition. Diurnal trends of emission factors showed substantial increases in emissions during the morning rush hour for black carbon (1.9 x), particle number (2.4 x), and particle-bound polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (3.0 x), affected by fleet make-up. In contrast, particle number emission factors were highest midday with mean values 3.7 x higher than at night. This midday increase was attributed to particle formation or growth from local traffic emissions and showed different wind direction dependence than regional events.

AB To better understand the molecular distributions, seasonality and source indices of organic aerosols in central Alaska, we measured homologous series of n-alkanes (C-19-C-35), fatty acids (C-12-C-32) and n-alcohols (C-8-C-30) in total suspended aerosols collected during June 2008 to 2009 using a gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The whole sampling period was divided as warm (early May to late September; summer) and cold (late September to early May; winter) periods. Molecular distribution was characterized in both periods by the predominance of C-25 for n-alkanes and C-24:0 for fatty acids. However, we noticed a difference in molecular distribution of n-alcohols between warm and cold periods, which was characterized by the predominance of C-22 in warm season while C-26 in cold period. Except for fatty acids, n-alkanes and n-alcohols showed higher concentrations in warm period than in cold period. We found significantly higher ratios of C-18:1/C-18:0 in warm period than those in cold period, suggesting the fresh biogenic and aged anthropogenic aerosols in warm and cold periods, respectively. This inference was consistent with significantly higher ratios of WSOC/OC, a proxy for photochemical aging, in cold period. Based on the carbon preference index (CPI), average chain length (ACL), low-to-high molecular weight (LMW/HMW) ratios, wax n-alkanes (%WNA) and estimated fossil fuel concentrations, we demonstrate that higher plant waxes, biomass burning from wildfires are two important sources in warm period while combustion derived anthropogenic emissions are major sources in cold period in central Alaska. This finding was further supported by higher ratios of nss-K+-/elemental carbon (EC) and methane-sulfonate (MSA(-))/EC ratios in warm period.

AB Upland forests are thought to be methane (CH4) sinks due to oxidation by methanotrophs in aerobic soils. However, CH4 budget for upland forests are not well quantified at the ecosystem scale, when possible CH4 sources, such as small wet areas, exists in the ecosystem. Here, we quantified CH4 fluxes in a cool-temperate larch plantation based on four-year continuous measurements using the hyperbolic relaxed eddy accumulation (HREA) method and dynamic closed chambers with a laser-based analyzer. After filling data gaps for half-hourly data using machine-learning-based regressions, we found that the forest acted as a net CH4 source at the canopy scale: 30 +/- 11 mg CH4 m(-2) yr(-1) in 2014, 56 +/- 8 mg CH4 m(-2) yr(-1) in 2015, 154 +/- 5 mg CH4 m(-2) yr(-1) in 2016, and 132 +/- 6 mg CH4 m(-2) yr(-1) in 2017. Hotspot emissions from the edge of the pond could strongly contribute to the canopy-scale emissions. The magnitude of the hotspot emissions was 10-100 times greater than the order of the canopy-scale and chamber-based CH4 fluxes at the dry soils. The high temperatures with wet conditions stimulated the hotspot emissions, and thus induced canopy-scale CH4 emissions in the summer. Understanding and modeling the dynamics of hotspot emissions are important for quantifying CH4 budgets of upland forests. Micrometeorological measurements at various forests are required for revisiting CH4 budget of upland forests.

AB Base cations, such as potassium (K+), calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+), are essential nutrients for plant growth and their atmospheric inputs can buffer the effect of acid deposition by nitrogen (N) and sulphur (S) compounds. However, the spatial variation in atmospheric deposition of these base cationic nutrients is less understood compared with N and S deposition. By synthesizing bulk deposition data for K+, Ca2+ and Mg2+, we assessed their annual rates and spatial characteristics at 34 forested sites across China. Our synthesis showed relatively high levels of bulk deposition of base cationic nutrients in China's forests, being an order of magnitude higher than in the USA and Europe. On average, K+, Cahigher than in the USA and Europe. On average, K+, Cahigher than in the USA and Europe. On average, K+, Ca2+ and mg(2+) accounted for 13%, 72% and 15% of the and mg(2+) accounted for 13%, 72% and 15% of the and mg(2+) accounted for 13%, 72% and 15% of the bulk deposition of base cationic nutrients, respectively. Surprisingly, base cation deposition was lower at sites near semi-arid regions compared with sites in eastern and southern China, which were far from semi-arid regions. Moreover, elevated base cation deposition was associated with urban hotspots, exhibiting a significant power-law increase with closer distance to the nearest large cities. We estimated that on average base cationic nutrients neutralized a significant proportion (76%) of the potential acid load due to acid deposition. Our findings suggest that in China there is considerable anthropogenic alteration of the regional cycling of base cationic nutrients, which plays an important role in counteracting the risk of soil acidification and base cation depletion in forest ecosystems, especially in the southern regions.

AB The bottom-up traffic emission model EMISENS is used to calculate hourly black carbon (BC) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emission rates on an average workday in Maribor (Slovenia), using emission factors that were previously determined with the on-road chasing measurements in Slovenia. From modeled NOx emission rates and in-situ NOx measurements we empirically determined the hourly dispersion of traffic emissions and applied it to model BC concentrations using BC emission rates. We compared the modeled BC concentrations with in-situ BC concentration measurements over three periods in winters 2011-2012 and 2012-2013, a total of 67 workdays. Measured BC concentrations were first apportioned to traffic using the top-down Aethalometer model. We found that the bottom-up modeled BC concentrations overestimated the top-down apportioned values by only 19%, 32% and 6% in each of the three investigated time periods, respectively. We did not find any influence of meteorology on the performance of the model. This is the first time that BC source apportionment results were used to evaluate traffic emissions calculated using the bottom-up modeling approach. We demonstrate that the two independent approaches yield similar results. We use thus validated emission inventory for evaluating different emission reduction scenarios. We show that excluding 10% of vehicles that are highest BC or NOx emitters would reduce the total BC or NOx emissions from traffic in Maribor by 39% and 33% respectively.

AB This work presents an evaluation of a surprising and unusual high turbidity summer period in 2013 recorded in the north-central Iberian Peninsula (IP). The study is made up of three main pollution episodes characterized by very high aerosol optical depth (AOD) values with the presence of fine aerosol particles: the strongest long-range transport Canadian Biomass Burning (BB) event recorded, one of the longest-lasting European Anthropogenic (A) episodes and an extremely strong regional BB. The Canadian BB episode was unusually strong with maximum values of AOD(440 nm) similar to 0.8, giving rise to the highest value recorded by photometer data in the IP with a clearly established Canadian origin. The anthropogenic pollution episode originated in Europe is mainly a consequence of the strong impact of Canadian BB events over north-central Europe. As regards the local episode, a forest fire in the nature reserve near the Duero River (north-central IP) impacted on the population over 200 km away from its source. These three episodes exhibited fingerprints in different aerosol columnar properties retrieved by sun-photometers of the AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) as well as in particle mass surface concentrations, PMx, measured by the European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP). Main statistics, time series and scatterplots relate aerosol loads (aerosol optical depth, AOD and particulate matter, PM) with aerosol size quantities (Angstrom Exponent and PM ratio). More detailed microphysical/optical properties retrieved by AERONET inversion products are analysed in depth to describe these events: contribution of fine and coarse particles to AOD and its ratio (the fine mode fraction), volume particle size distribution, fine volume fraction, effective radius, sphericity fraction, single scattering albedo and absorption optical depth. Due to its relevance in climate studies, the aerosol radiative effect has been quantified for the top and bottom of the atmosphere, obtaining mean daily values for this extraordinary summer period of -14.5 and -47.5 Wm(-2), respectively.

AB Measurements of ambient aerosol particles at the University of Leon, Leon, Spain, were made in May and June 2015 with a Wideband Integrated Bioaerosol Spectrometer (WIBS). The WIBS detects Fluorescing Aerosol Particles (FAP) in the size range from 0.5 to 20 mu m. These measurements were complemented with an analysis of pollen concentrations assessed with optical microscopy of samples captured with a volumetric Hirst spore trap. The total particle, FAP and pollen concentrations show clear, daily cycles. Whereas the total particle concentrations maximize at 0800 and 2200 UTC, the FAP concentrations have peaks at midnight and 0800 UTC while the pollen has a broad peak between 1200 and 2000 UTC. The FAP larger than 2 mu m represent 15-35% of the total particle population in this size range, maximizing at midnight UTC. Similar to what has been found by investigators at other locations, there is a strong positive correlation of the WIBS measured FAP with relative humidity; however, the pollen concentration is positively correlated with the temperature and anti-correlated with the relative humidity. Back trajectory analysis indicates that the largest FAP to total particle fractions are found in air masses arriving from the northeast with the second largest coming from the southwest. Given the location of the university in relation to the city and forested areas, this implies that the higher concentration FAP are coming from rural, probably natural, sources; however, more local, anthropogenic sources cannot be ruled out as a secondary source. The majority of the FAP that are identified from microscopy are fungal spores (Cladosporium, Aspergillus, Alternaria, Oidium) and pollen grains (mainly Poaceae, Quercus, Plantago, Rumex and Urticaceae). A comparison of the fluorescence fingerprints between laboratory generated FAP and the ambient particles showed some similarities; however, a significant fraction of the FAP are those whose fluorescence patterns do not match any of those that have been previously classified in the laboratory.

AB The long-lived radioactive iodine (I-129) is a useful geochemical tracer of radioactivity in the atmospheric environment. Although the behavior of I-129 in the atmosphere is still not fully known because of lack of continuous monitoring, we recently observed clear seasonal trends in air concentration and deposition of I-129 in Japan. Using these data, we developed a global atmospheric I-129 transport model to reveal key processes for the global atmospheric I-129 cycle. The physical and chemical processes of advection, turbulent diffusion, dry and wet deposition, atmospheric photolysis, gas-particle conversion in the atmosphere, anthropogenic sources of I-129 discharged from operating nuclear fuel reprocessing plants, and natural sources of I-129 volatilized from ocean and land were included into the model. The model generally reproduced the observed seasonal change in monthly air concentration and deposition of I-129 in Japan, and the global distribution of I-129 concentration in rain as presented in past literature. Numerical experiments changing the intensity of anthropogenic and natural sources were conducted to quantify the impact of anthropogenic sources on the global I-129 cycle. The results indicated that the atmospheric I-129 from the anthropogenic sources was readily deposited in winter and can be accumulated mainly in the northern part of Eurasia. In contrast, the atmospheric I-129 from the natural sources dominated the deposition in summer. These results suggested that the re-emission process of I-129 from the Earth's surface may be important as a secondary impact of I-129 in the global-scaled environment. Furthermore, although wet deposition dominated the total deposition in the Northern hemisphere, dry deposition regionally and seasonally contributed to the total deposition over arctic and northern part of Eurasia in winter, suggesting that the dry deposition may play a key role in the seasonal change of I-129 deposition in the high latitudes of the Northern hemisphere.

AB E-CF3CH=CHC2F5 is a promising substance that could be used as high temperature bump working fluid. In this study, the rate constants (k(1)) for the reaction of E-CF3CH=CHC2F5 with OH were measured by the relative rate method: k(1) (298K) = (9.10 +/- 0.29) x 10 -14 and k(1) (253-328K) = (7.56 +/- 0.88) x 10(-12) exp.[- (632 +/- 35)/T] cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1). The atmospheric lifetime of E-CF3CH=CHC2F5 was estimated to be 127 d, while its radiative efficiency (RE) was evaluated to be 0.198 W m(-2) ppb(-1). The estimated POCPs of E-CF3CH=CHC2F5 were estimated to be 0.5 and 0.2 for North-west European and USA urban conditions, respectively. The 20, 100, and 500-year time horizon global warming potentials (GWPs) of E-CF3CH=CHC2F5 were estimated to be 73, 20, and 6, respectively. CF3OOOCF3, CF3OOOC2F5, COF2 , CO2 and CO2 were identified as the carbon-containing products following the degradation of E-CF3CH=CHC2F5.

AB Vegetation open fires constitute a significant source of particulate pollutants on a global scale and play an important role in both atmospheric chemistry and climate change. To better understand the emission and aging characteristics of smoke aerosols, we performed small-scale fire experiments using the Large Aerosol Chamber (LAC, 1800 m(3)) with a focus on biomass burning from Siberian boreal coniferous forests. A series of burn experiments were conducted with typical Siberian biomass (pine and debris), simulating separately different combustion conditions, namely, flaming, smoldering and mixed phase.
   Following smoke emission and dispersion in the combustion chamber, we investigated aging of aerosols under dark conditions. Here, we present experimental data on emission factors of total, elemental and organic carbon, as well as individual organic compounds, such as anhydrosugars, phenolic and dicarboxylic acids. We found that total carbon accounts for up to 80% of the fine mode (PM2.5) smoke aerosol. Higher PM2.5 emission factors were observed in the smoldering compared to flaming phase and in pine compared to debris smoldering phase. For low-temperature combustion, organic carbon (OC) contributed to more than 90% of total carbon, whereas elemental carbon (EC) dominated the aerosol composition in flaming burns with a 60-70% contribution to the total carbon mass. For all smoldering burns, levoglucosan (LG), a cellulose decomposition product, was the most abundant organic species (average LG/OC = 0.26 for pine smoldering), followed by its isomer mannosan or dehydroabietic acid (DA), an important constituent of conifer resin (DA/OC = 0.033). A levoglucosan-to-mannosan ratio of about 3 was observed, which is consistent with ratios reported for coniferous biomass and more generally softwood.
   The rates of aerosol removal for OC and individual organic compounds were investigated during aging in the chamber in terms of mass concentration loss rates over time under dark conditions and compared to the loss rate of EC. The latter is used as an inert tracer for estimating aerosol mechanical deposition and wall losses of the otherwise chemically conserved aerosol species. The OC/EC ratio increased with smoke aging for the flaming phase, suggesting a production/partitioning of organic compounds after emission. On the other hand, for smoldering burns OC/EC ratios decreased further with aging due to additional sinks of OC, other than those related to deposition and wall losses alone, such as evaporation of semi-volatile compounds. The chemical fingerprints of the major PM components of fresh and aged smoke found in this study are proposed to be used for the assessment of contributions from Siberian biomass burning to atmospheric pollution in source apportionment studies like those using molecular marker approaches.

AB Wind erosion is a significant threat to the productivity and sustainability of agricultural soils. In the dryland winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-fallow region of Inland Pacific Northwest of the USA (PNW), farmers increasingly use conservation tillage practices to control wind erosion. In addition, some farmers in this dry region apply municipal biosolids to soils as fertilizer and a source of stable organic matter. The impacts of soil management practices on emissions of dust microbiota to the atmosphere are understudied. We used high-throughput DNA sequencing to examine the impacts of conservation tillage and biosolids amendments on the transport of dust-associated fungal and bacterial communities during simulated high-wind events over two years at Lind, WA. The fungal and bacterial communities contained in windblown dust differed significantly with tillage (conservation vs. conventional) and fertilizer (synthetic vs. biosolids) treatments. However, the richness and diversity of fungal and bacterial communities of dust did not vary significantly with tillage or fertilizer treatments. Taxa enriched in dust from fields under conservation tillage represented many plant-associated taxa that likely grow on residue left on the soil surface, whereas taxa that were more abundant with conventional tillage were those that likely grow on buried plant residue. Dust from biosolids-amended fields harbored greater abundances of taxa that likely feed on introduced carbon. Most human-associated taxa that may pose a health risk were not present in dust after biosolids amendment, although members of Clostridiaceae were enriched with this treatment. Results show that tillage and fertilizer management practices impact the composition of bioaerosols emitted during high-wind events and have potential implications for plant and human health.

AB Meteorology plays vital role in predicting air quality parameters in regional chemical transport models. WRF-Chem is one such chemical transport model that includes various physics and chemistry options for simulating ozone and PM10 concentrations. In this study, WRF-Chem model was used to compare the performance of different Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL) parameterization namely, the Yonsei University (YSU) and Asymmetric Convective Model v2 (ACM2) PBL schemes, over the Delhi megacity urban airshed. Surface observations were used for comparisons and evaluating model performance for both meteorological and air quality variables. The ACM2 PBL scheme resulted in better model performance for simulating ozone and PM10 concentrations along with an improvement in temperature and wind speeds due to incorporation of both local and non-local characteristics. The dependency of ozone and PM10 concentrations on meteorological parameters temperature and wind speed were studied. The influence of PBL height and ventilation coefficient on model performance was analysed as dispersion of pollutants strongly depend on these factors. The PBL height was highly over estimated during evening hours which was also reflected in the corresponding ventilation coefficient values. Even though ACM2 PBL scheme was concluded as the best PBL scheme for the study region, it still requires significant improvement for simulating air quality parameters. Further, ozone and PM10 concentrations were scrutinized for varying ranges of temperature and wind speed. Model performance for ozone and PM10 concentrations was good for temperature values below 40 degrees C and wind speed <= 8 m/s. A poor model performance was observed for regions with high wind speed values. Even though certain limitations were observed in the model evaluation of PBL height and high wind speed values, WRF-Chem model can be effectively employed for simulating ozone and PM10 , concentrations giving due considerations to limitations on high temperature and high wind speed regime.

AB There is a growing need for a broad overview of the state of knowledge on the environmental aspects of Electric Vehicles (EVs), which could help policymakers in the objective of making road transportation more sustainable and environmental friendly. This study provides a comprehensive review of the effects of EVs adoption on air quality, greenhouse gas emissions, and human health. Specifically, we (i) synthesized relevant published literature related to environmental implication of EVs, (ii) quantitatively evaluated the effect of EVs on environment and human health, and (iii) identified research gaps and recommend future research areas for the adoption of EVs and their benefits to society. We assessed in total 4734 studies and selected 123 articles of more detailed review, with 65 articles fulfilling the inclusion criteria. The studies reviewed consistently showed reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and emissions of some criteria pollutants. Particularly on PM and SO2, the increases or decreases are very dependent on the context. Overall, the positive benefits of EVs for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and human exposure depends on the following factors: (i) type of EV, (ii) source of energy generation, (iii) driving conditions, (iv) charging patterns, (v) availbailty of charging infrastructure, (vi) govermnat policies, and (vii) climate of a regions. This study provides a comprehansive analysis and review on the benefits of electric mobility.

AB Dose Response Functions (DRFs) are widely used in estimating corrosion and/or soiling levels of materials used in building constructions and cultural monuments. These functions quantify the effects of air pollution and environmental parameters on different materials through ground based measurements of specific air pollutants and climatic parameters. Here, we propose a new approach where available satellite observations are used instead of ground-based data. Through this approach, the use of DRFs is expanded to cover situations where there are no in situ measurements, introducing also a totally new field where satellite data can be shown to be very helpful. In the present work satellite observations made by MODIS (MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) on board Terra and Aqua, OMI (Ozone Monitoring Instrument) on board Aura and AIRS (Atmospheric Infrared Sounder) on board Aqua have been used.

Due to limited availability of observational data, it is difficult to understand/estimate the impact of dust aerosols on the Earth's radiation budget in detail. This study, applies a regional model, Weather Research and Forecasting model with chemistry (WRF-Chem), to investigate the impact of an intense dust storm that originated over the Arabian peninsula during 01-02 April 2015 and transported towards the Indian subcontinent by the westerly winds. Two identical numerical experiments are designed, each for 15 days, one with and another without dust aerosols, to estimate the impact of the dust storm over the Indian subcontinent and adjoining regions. WRF-Chem model reproduced the spatial, temporal as well as the vertical distribution of dust plume reasonably well.
   Model results show significant changes in aerosol optical, physical and radiative properties due to the dominance of coarse mode aerosols in the atmosphere during the dust storm. Analysis of vertical profiles of particulate matter (PM10) concentration reveals the presence of dust aerosols extending from the surface to altitudes as high as 3-4 km during the dust storm period. The dust storm induced a cooling effect at the surface via reduction in shortwave (SW) radiative flux. A substantial decrease in temperature is also seen at 850 hPa due to dust, indicating a significant impact of dust layer on the atmospheric temperature profile. Atmospheric heating due to dust aerosols in the SW region is found to be compensated up to a large extent by longwave (LW) cooling effect of dust. The net dust induced radiative perturbation at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) over different regions is negative and varied from -2.49 to -0.34 Wm(-2), while it is in the range of -0.62 to + 0.32 W-2 at the surface.

AB Reducing aviation emissions will be a major concern in the coming years, as the relative contribution of aviation to overall emissions is projected to increase in the future. The South Coast Air Basin of California (SoCAB) is an extreme nonattainment area with many airports located upwind of the most polluted regions in the basin. Techniques to reduce aviation emissions have been studied in the past, and strategies that can be implemented at airports include taxi-out times reduction, ground support equipment electrification and aviation biofuel implementation. These strategies have been analyzed only at the national scale, their effectiveness to improve air quality within the SoCAB given the local meteorology and chemical regimes is unclear. This work studies how the adoption of the techniques at commercial SoCAB airports affect ozone (O-3) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations. In addition, potential impacts on public exposure to PM2.5 and O-3 resulting from changes in the concentration of these pollutants are estimated. In addition, the work calculates aviation emissions for each scenario and simulate the transport and atmospheric chemistry of the pollutants using the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model. The simultaneous application of all reduction strategies is projected to reduce the aviation-attributable population weighted ground-level PM2.5 by 36% in summer and 32% in winter. On the other hand, O-3 increases by 16% in winter. Occurring mostly in densely populated areas, the decrease in ground-level PM2.5 would have a positive health impact and help the region achieve attainment of national ambient air quality standards.

AB Precipitation susceptibility of monsoon clouds to changes in aerosols has been studied initially by utilizing ground based observations from a High Altitude Cloud Physics Laboratory (HACPL), Mahabaleshwar, India collected during monsoon seasons and later compared with the results obtained from satellite observations. Cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentration, rain intensity and integrated liquid have been taken from ground based observations for calculating precipitation susceptibility. As a first step, we have analyzed the temporal variation of CCN concentration, rain intensity and integrated liquid water during monsoon season. It is observed that all three parameters exhibit strong diurnal variation with two peaks i.e. in morning and afternoon. CCN showed strong morning peak whereas other two showed during afternoon hours. Later precipitation susceptibility has been estimated using CCN as aerosol proxy and it is higher similar to 0.65 for the integrated liquid water ranging from 0.6 to 0.8 mm. Secondly, we have compared ground based observation with satellite observations carried out using aerosol optical depth (AOD), rain rate and liquid water path. Satellite observations showed that precipitation susceptibility, S-0, using AOD as aerosol proxy is higher (S-0 = 0.98) for liquid water path ranging from 800 to 1000 gm(-2). It is also seen that the results are in agreement with the earlier reported results especially with the report from tropical region. Present analysis also showed that the precipitation is getting suppressed at medium range of integrated liquid/liquid water path. This is the first such study from Indian region explicitly using ground-based observations.

AB As potential carriers of hazardous pollutants, airborne particles may deposit onto surfaces due to gravitational settling. A modified Markov chain model to predict gravity induced particle dispersion and deposition is proposed in the paper. The gravity force is considered as a dominant weighting factor to adjust the State Transfer Matrix, which represents the probabilities of the change of particle spatial distributions between consecutive time steps within an enclosure. The model performance has been further validated by particle deposition in a ventilation chamber and a horizontal turbulent duct flow in pre-existing literatures. Both the proportion of deposited particles and the dimensionless deposition velocity are adopted to characterize the validation results. Comparisons between our simulated results and the experimental data from literatures show reasonable accuracy. Moreover, it is also found that the dimensionless deposition velocity can be remarkably influenced by particle size and stream-wise velocity in a typical horizontal flow. This study indicates that the proposed model can predict the gravity-dominated airborne particle deposition with reasonable accuracy and acceptable computing time.

AB Biomass burning is a serious problem in the environment and climate system. However, the source identification of biomass-burning aerosols was somewhat impeded, partly due to the difficulty in quantification of relevant molecular markers. In this study, we present reference values for five aromatic acids (including p-hydroxybenzoic, vanillic, dehydroabietic, syringic and p-coumaric acids) in the NIST Standard Reference Material (SRM) 1649b. The concentration of levoglucosan was also revisited. Notable positive matrix effect was found for vanillic, dehydroabietic, syringic and coumaric acid. Using the standard addition method, the average value of p-hydroxybenzoic, vanillic, syringic, dehydroabietic and p-coumaric acids in SRM 1649b were found to be 26.9, 9.53, 1.13, 7.60 and 1.66 mu g g(-1), respectively. The analytical method developed in this study was also applied to the PM 10 samples from Beijing and PM2.5 samples from South Asia (Godavari, Nepal). The ratios of vanillic to p-hydroxybenzoic acid and syringic to vanillic acid further suggested that their biomass-burning types are mainly related to hard wood and herbaceous species (i.e., agricultural residues).

AB Since their inclusion in the Stockholm Convention, there has been a need for global monitoring of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), its salts and perfluorooctanesulfonyl fluoride (PFOSF), along with other non-listed highly fluorinated compounds. Passive air samplers (PAS) are ideal for geographic coverage of atmospheric monitoring. The most common type of PAS, using polyurethane foam (PUF) as a sorbent, was primarily developed for non-polar semivolatile organic compounds (SVOCs) and are not well-validated for polar substances such as the per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), however, they have been used for some PFASs, particularly PFOS. To evaluate their applicability, PAS were deployed for measurement of PFASs in outdoor and indoor air. Outdoors, two types of PAS, one consisting of PUF and one of XAD-2 resin, were deployed in an 18-week calibration study in parallel with a low-volume active air sampler (LV-AAS) in a suburban area. Indoors, PUF-PAS were similarly deployed over 12 weeks to evaluate their applicability for indoor monitoring. Samples were analysed for perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs), perfluoroalkyl sulfonates (PFSAs), perfluorooctane sulfonamides (FOSAs), and perfluorooctane sulfonamidoethanols (FOSEs). In outdoor air, 17 out of the 21 PFAS were detected in more than 50% of samples, with a median Sigma(17)PFASs of 18.0 pg m(-3) while 20 compounds were detected in indoor air with a median concentration Sigma(20)PFASs of 76.6 pg m(-3) using AAS samplers. PFOS was the most common PFAS in the outdoor air while PFBA was most common indoors. Variability between PAS and AAS was observed and comparing gas phase and particle phase separately or in combination did not account for the variation observed. PUF-PAS may still have a valuable use in PFAS monitoring but more work is needed to identify the applicability of passive samplers for ionic PFAS.

AB Ground measurements of physical, chemical and hygroscopic properties of aerosols were made at the Olympic Park, Seoul, as part of the KORea-United States Air Quality study (KORUS-AQ) campaign in May-June 2016. The average number concentrations of aerosols larger than 10 nm in diameter and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) at 0.6% supersaturation (S) were 10800 cm(-3) and 3400 cm(-3), respectively. The average geometric mean diameter (D-g) was 44 nm, and size-resolved aerosol hygroscopicity (kappa) from HTDMA ranged from 0.11 to 0.24 for particle diameters in the range of 30-150 nm. Aerosols were classified into three types based on mixing state and hygroscopic growth factor (GF): Type 1 (externally mixed aerosol), Type 2 (Internally mixed and growth aerosol) and Type 3 (internally mixed and non-growth aerosol). These three aerosol types showed distinct diurnal patterns. The difference in physical and chemical properties of aerosols for different air mass sources crucially impacted aerosol hygroscopicity. Using the external mixture assumption with measured hygroscopicity data improved the results of CCN prediction compared to those from the simple internal mixture assumption because externally mixed aerosols comprised a significant portion of aerosols in this urban area. Moreover, the simple assumption of aerosol size distribution with a fixed chemical composition sufficiently explained more than 50 percent of the variation of CCN number concentrations, although the information of chemical composition was still meaningful. Overall, the measured data showed consistency with Megacity Air Pollution Studies (MAPS-Seoul) campaign held during May-June 2015, implying that these results may represent urban aerosols in spring/summer in the Korean Peninsula.

AB There is increasing evidence that aqueous-phase atmospheric chemistry is an important source of secondary organic aerosols (SOA), but the related processes are currently not adequately represented in atmospheric chemistry models. Here we show that the absorption spectrum of pyruvic acid (PA) exhibits both an increase of the absorption intensity and a red shift of 13 nm while going from a dilute aqueous phase to a solution containing the inert salt sodium perchlorate (5M NaClO4). If this phenomenon turns out to be more general, many compounds that do not absorb actinic light in clouds and fog could become light absorbers at elevated salt concentrations in aerosol deliquescent particles. Compared to the direct photolysis of PA in dilute aqueous solution, the photolysis rate is increased by three times at high ionic strength (5M NaClO4 ). Such a considerable enhancement can be rationalized in the framework of the Debye-McAulay approach for reactions of ionic + neutral (or neutral + neutral) species, considering that the PA direct photolysis likely involves interaction between the photogenerated triplet state and water. This is, to our knowledge, the first report of a significant effect of the ionic strength on the rate of an atmospheric photochemical reaction. The phenomenon has important implications for the fate of PA and, potentially, of other organic compounds in atmospheric aerosol deliquescent particles.

AB The morphology, composition, and complex mixing states of aerosol are extremely important physicochemical properties which are the major inputs to the optical/radiative models. Though, ground based observations of the said properties are abundant but the vertical profiles of the same are very much limited throughout the globe. The information on the vertical heterogeneity of the aforementioned properties over a polluted environment like Delhi will be very helpful to develop a better understanding of the thermodynamics of the lower atmosphere.
   In present study, we carried out a tethered balloon based field campaign in National Physical Laboratory (28 degrees 38' 10 '' N, 77 degrees 10' 17 '' E) from 21 to 27 February 2014 to explore the vertical distribution of the said properties. Based on the microscopic observations, the bubbly shaped sulfate particles number percentage is less (5%) on the ground, abundant (49%) on altitude < 350 m and nearly absent on altitude > 350 m. At 500 m altitude, particles were majorly of spiked shape with elongated dimension similar to 3-4 mu m. The number percentage of the aged fractals has been found to increase by 4% in the 100-350 m range against the ground observations. Based on the bulk composition of non-carbonaceous species, at 200 m altitude, we observed significant amount (74%) of the oxides of sulfur compared to that of ground observations (30%) that could be due to temperature inversion and air parcel movement from IGP (Indo Gangetic Plain). Various core-shell type particle configurations have been observed at different altitudes. At 200 m altitude, particles were majorly aged with anionic species (like S, Cl and HSO4) and cationic species (like C2H5). The bulk and individual particle level data generated over Delhi environment in this experiment may improve our understanding of boundary layer aerosol and could provide the scientific insights of their probable effects on low level cloud formation.

AB Diesel fuel is a complex mixture of intermediate volatility organic compounds (IVOCs). Previous studies focused on secondary organic aerosol (SOA) and ozone formation from photo-oxidation of organic vapor from diesel exhaust and their components such as aromatics and heavy alkanes. However, there are few studies on atmospheric behavior of unburnt diesel. Therefore, in this study, ten unburnt #2 commercial diesel samples and one FACE9A research diesel fuel were photo-oxidized in the University of California Riverside, College of Engineering-Center for Environmental Research & Technology dual environmental chambers to investigate their SOA and ozone production potential. Photochemical aging rapidly produced significant SOA (yield similar to 20.3-37.7%) in the presence of a surrogate reactive organic gas (ROG) mixture used to mimic urban atmospheric reactivity. SOA yields were consistent with n-Heptadecane yields under similar conditions. Doubling NOx concentrations within relevant urban concentration levels enhanced SOA formation by 33% and ozone formation by 48%. SOA formation in this study was approximately fourteen times higher than previously reported for very high NOx conditions. An SOA experiment designed to mimic the previous work achieved similar yields to the earlier work. SOA formed under urban relevant NOx concentrations were consistent with semi-volatile-oxygenated organic aerosol (SV-OOA) and underwent little further chemical processing once produced.

AB Vertical profiles of carbon dioxide (CO2) mixing ratio in the equatorial eastern and western Pacific were measured by newly developed balloon-borne CO2 sondes in February 2012 (two soundings) and February-March 2015 (four soundings), respectively. The 1-10 km vertically averaged CO2 mixing ratios lie between the background surface values in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) and those in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) monitored at ground-based sites during these periods. A backward trajectory analysis, taking account of convective mixing processes using geostationary satellite cloud-image data, is applied to the measured CO2 profiles to estimate the origin of the observed air masses. Air masses originating in the SH show low CO2 mixing ratios that are similar to the background values in the SH. This relationship is confirmed by a positive correlation (similar to 0.6) between the CO2 mixing ratio and the latitude of air mass origin which is found from trajectory calculations. This result suggests that the CO2 distribution in the troposphere over the equatorial Pacific is controlled by monthly time scale, large-scale CO2 distribution and weekly time-scale atmospheric transport processes. Furthermore, this study shows that the combination of CO2 sonde measurements and trajectory analysis, taking account of convective mixing, is a useful tool in investigating CO2 transport processes.

AB ADMS-Urban is a non-linear, static, urban air quality model, with high-dimensional outputs. A simulation of NO2 and PM10 concentrations every hour during a full year and over an entire city can take dozens of days of computations, which greatly limits the range of methods that can be applied to the model, especially for uncertainty quantification. This work presents a method to replace the complete model, ADMS-Urban, with a meta model or surrogate model, i.e., a reasonably close approximation of ADMS-Urban whose computational cost is negligible. When the emissions are formulated as a function of the day and the hour, the complete-model inputs essentially contain a few scalar values, to describe the meteorological conditions, the background pollution and the target date. The complete-model outputs are first projected onto a reduced subspace. The relations between the projection coefficients and the low-dimensional inputs are then emulated by a fast statistical emulator, based on Kriging or radial basis functions (RBF). The mean error between the meta-model and ADMS-Urban is 22% with Kriging and 27% with RBF for NO2, and 14% with Kriging and 20% with RBF for PK10. The meta-model performs as well as ADMS-Urban when compared to the observations. Its computational cost is almost negligible to compute the concentrations at a given hour and date for an entire city: 50 ms with RBF and 150 ms with Kriging to simulate 1 h on one core, while the complete model requires 8 min on 16 cores.

AB The waste heat recovery (HR) systems are employed to increase the overall thermal efficiency of electric generation units (EGUs). Although the emission factors (in terms of gram of pollutants per unit of thermal energy consumed or electric energy generated) generally decreases after installing HR systems, the emission rates in terms of grams of pollutants per unit of time remain unchanged. However, HR systems reduce stack exit temperature, resulting in lower effective emission heights, which lead to higher near-source ground level concentrations (GLCs) of air pollutants. In order to comprehensively evaluate the near-source air quality impact from deploying HR systems, we proposed a new modeling framework by integrating a computationally efficient Gaussian-based dispersion model (AERMOD) and a (relatively) more accurate computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. As a demonstration of the proposed framework, we investigated the HR impact on NO,, concentrations near a simple cycle gas turbine located in Brentwood, NY. Specifically, we applied the AERMOD modeling system to screen the hourly GLCs over five years, and highest values (and the corresponding hours) were shown to cluster into two main meteorological conditions: the stable atmospheric boundary layer with relatively high wind speed (Stable, HW) and the unstable atmospheric boundary layer with relatively low wind speed (Unstable, LW). These two conditions were further simulated using a CFD model that have been extensively evaluated previously for detailed analysis. By setting different stack exit temperatures, the near-source air quality impact of different waste heat conversion rates was evaluated. We introduced a concept called the heat recovery amplified factor (HRAF), defined as the ratio between the maximum GLC with HR system and that without HR system, as an indicator of HR impact. HRAF was shown to be much more sensitive to temperature in the Unstable, LW condition than in the Stable, HW condition. Although the results were limited to a specific simple cycle gas turbine, the proposed modeling framework and HRAF can be used for evaluating the HR systems impact for other emission sources.

AB In a relatively low mountain area adjacent to Matsuyama city in Japan, ozone concentration variations were studied at spatial scales of O(10) similar to O(10(3)) m. Walking mobile measurements were complemented by vertical profiling, wind measurements, and passive sampling. The broad -scale distribution at O(10(2)) similar to O(10(3)) m was found to depend on time of day, atmospheric stability, and geography in ways consistent with previous studies. Well-defined areas of low ozone concentrations O(10) m in width were found at several locations. No distinctive features of these locations were immediately discernible, but detailed examination of the temporal variations coupled with the wind field suggested that the distribution of the low-ozone areas was determined by subtle differences in the terrain topography.

AB Environmentally persistent free radicals (EPFRs) are present within atmospheric fine particles, and they are assumed to be a potential factor responsible for human pneumonia and lung cancer. This study presents a new method for the rapid quantification of EPFRs in atmospheric particles with a quartz sheet-based approach using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The three-dimensional distributions of the relative response factors in a cavity resonator were simulated and utilized for an accurate quantitative determination of EPFRs in samples. Comparisons between the proposed method and conventional quantitative methods were also performed to illustrate the advantages of the proposed method. The results suggest that the reproducibility and accuracy of the proposed method are superior to those of the quartz tube-based method. Although the solvent extraction method is capable of extracting specific EPFR species, the developed method can be used to determine the total EPFR content; moreover, the analysis process of the proposed approach is substantially quicker than that of the solvent extraction method. The proposed method has been applied in this study to determine the EPFRs in ambient PM2.5 samples collected over Xi'an, the results of which will be useful for extensive research on the sources, concentrations, and physical-chemical characteristics of EPFRs in the atmosphere.

AB Excitation-emission matrix (EEM) spectra were used to analyze the fluorescence properties of water-soluble organic compounds (WSOC) in PM2.5 during winter and summer seasons in Lanzhou city, northwest China. Protein-like substances, humic-like substances and microbial by-products were found to be the main fluorophoric organic matter. Humification index (HIX), biological index (BIX) and fluorescence index (FI) were 1.2 +/- 0.1, 1.4 +/- 0.1 and 1.7 +/- 0.2 in winter and 2.0 +/- 0.3, 1.3 +/- 0,1 and 1.2 +/- 0.4 in summer, respectively, indicating higher aromaticity of WSOC in summer and terrestrial biogenic sources of WSOC in both seasons. Strong correlations were found between regional average fluorescence intensities (RAFI) at the fluorescence regions of II-V and water-soluble inorganic ions (K+, Cl, NO3- and SO42-) in winter with the Spearman correlation coefficients rho being larger than 0.7 and mostly around 0.9, suggesting significant contributions of bioaerosols, coal combustion and vehicle exhaust to PM2.5. Moderate correlations were found between RAFI and K+, Cl-, and NO3- in summer, indicating the more important roles of biogenic and vehicle exhaust than coal combustion sources in summer. High temperature in winter was conducive to and in summer prohibitive to polycondensation of WSOC, indicating the existence of an optimum temperature for such a process to occur. High relative humidity was unfavorable to the formation of fluorescent WSOC.

AB Seabird colonies alter the biogeochemistry of nearby ecosystems, while the associated emissions of ammonia (NH3) may cause acidification and eutrophication of finely balanced biomes. To examine the possible effects of future climate change on the magnitude and distribution of seabird NH3 emissions globally, a global seabird database was used as input to the GUANO model, a dynamic mass-flow process-based model that simulates NH3 losses from seabird colonies at an hourly resolution in relation to environmental conditions. Ammonia emissions calculated by the GUANO model were in close agreement with measured NH3 emissions across a wide range of climates. For the year 2010, the total global seabird NH3 emission is estimated at 82 [37-127] Gg year(-1). This is less than previously estimated using a simple temperature-dependent empirical model, mainly due to inclusion of nitrogen wash-off from colonies during precipitation events in the GUANO model. High precipitation, especially between 40 degrees and 60 degrees S, results in total emissions for the penguin species that are 82% smaller than previously estimated, while for species found in dry tropical areas, emissions are 83-133% larger. Application of temperature anomalies for several IPCC scenarios for 2099 in the GUANO model indicated a predicted net increase in global seabird NH3 emissions of 27% (B1 scenario) and 39% (A2 scenario), compared with the 2010 estimates. At individual colonies, the net change was the result of influences of temperature, precipitation and relative humidity change, with smaller effects of wind-speed changes. The largest increases in NH3 emissions (mean: 60% [486 to -50] increase; A2 scenario for 2099 compared with 2010) were found for colonies 40 degrees S to 65 degrees N, and may lead to increased plant growth and decreased biodiversity by eliminating nitrogen sensitive plant species. Only 7% of the seabird colonies assessed globally (mainly limited to the sub-polar Southern Ocean) were estimated to experience a reduction in NH3 emission (average: -18% [-50 to 0] reduction between 2010 and 2099, A2 scenario), where an increase in precipitation was found to more than offset the effect of rising temperatures.

AB In this paper we illustrate the application of modern functional data analysis methods to study the spatiotemporal variability of particulate matter components across the United States. The approach models the pollutant annual profiles in a way that describes the dynamic behavior over time and space. This new technique allows us to predict yearly profiles for locations and years at which data are not available and also offers dimension reduction for easier visualization of the data. Additionally it allows us to study changes of pollutant levels annually or for a particular season. We apply our method to daily concentrations of two particular components of PM2.5 measured by two networks of monitoring sites across the United States from 2003 to 2015. Our analysis confirms existing findings and additionally reveals new trends in the change of the pollutants across seasons and years that may not be as easily determined from other common approaches such as Kriging.

AB We exploited a novel sampling vehicle, a multi-rotor drone carrying a remote-controlled whole air sampling device, to collect aerial samples with high sample integrity and preservation conditions. An array of 106 volatile organic compounds (VOCs), CO, CH4, and CO2 were analyzed and compared between the aerial samples (300-m height) and the ground-level samples in pairs to inspect for vertical mixing of the trace gases at a coastal site under three different meteorological conditions of local circulation, frontal passage, and high-pressure peripheral circulation. A rather homogeneous composition was observed for the sample pairs immediately after the frontal passage, indicating a well-mixed condition below 300 m. In contrast, inhomogeneous mixing was observed for the sample pairs under the other two conditions (local circulation and high-pressure peripheral circulation), suggesting different layers of air masses. Furthermore, information of unique source markers, composition profiles, and lifetimes of compounds were used to differentiate the origins of the air masses aloft and at the surface to substantiate the observed inhomogeneity. The study demonstrates that, with the availability of the near-surface aerial sampling coupling with in-laboratory analysis, detailed compositions of trace gases can now be readily obtained with superior data quality. Based on the distinctive chemical compositions, the sources, transport, and atmospheric mixing of the airborne pollutants in the near-surface atmosphere can be better studied and understood.

AB Air pollution is among the greatest risk factors for human health, but it also poses risks to the food security, the economy and the environment. The majority of the pollutants emitted by human activities derive from the production and use of fossil-fuel-based energy. Most energy-related emissions contain sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. The principal source of sulfur dioxide originates from coal, and the main sources of nitrogen oxide emissions are power generation and use of vehicles. Other important pollutants are the inhalable coarse particles (PM10) and the fine particulate matter (PM2.5), which arises from the building sector.
   Over the last decade, since Romania joined the European Union on the 1st of January 2007, the use of fossil fuels has decreased dramatically, as consumers switched to either natural gas or biomass. This was as a result of the European Commission encouraging the member countries to make use of renewable sources (including biomass). To reduce the PM emissions, in April 2015 EC has extended the EcoDesign Directive to solid-fuel boilers and solid-fuel space heaters. The boilers need to generally meet certain requirements that will be introduced by 1 January 2020. In this article, we are highlighting the fluctuations in air pollution in Romania from the European WebDAB - EMAP database and trends in ambient concentrations of air pollutants using Romania's national air pollution monitoring network.
   Romania's Air Pollutants/Air Quality Monitoring Network consists of 142 automatic air quality monitoring stations. The results indicate that Romania's annual average mass emissions of CO decreased from 3186 Gg in 1990 to 774 in 2014 (decrease by < 76%), SOx decreased from 1311Gg-176Gg (decrease by similar to 60%), NOx decreased from 546 Gg to 218 (decrease by similar to 87%), CO2 decreased from 66.226 Gg/year in 2007 to 38.916 Gg/ year in 2014 (decrease by < 41%).

AB An Eulerian-Lagrangian 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of pesticide dust drift from precision vacuum planters in field conditions was developed. Tractor and planter models were positioned in an atmospheric computational domain, representing the field and its edges. Physicochemical properties of dust abraded from maize seeds (particle size, shape, porosity, density, a.i. content), dust emission rates and exhaust air velocity values at the planter fan outlets were measured experimentally and implemented in the model. The wind profile, the airflow pattern around the machines and the dust dispersion were computed. Various maize sowing scenarios with different wind conditions, dust properties, planter designs and vacuum pressures were simulated. Dust particle trajectories were calculated by means of Lagrangian particle tracking, considering nonspherical particle drag, gravity and turbulent dispersion. The dust dispersion model was previously validated with wind tunnel data. In this study, simulated pesticide concentrations in the air and on the soil in the different sowing scenarios were compared and discussed. The model predictions were similar to experimental literature data in terms of concentrations and drift distance. Pesticide exposure levels to bees during flight and foraging were estimated from the simulated concentrations. The proposed CFD model can be used in risk assessment studies and in the evaluation of dust drift mitigation measures.

AB Livestock is the largest anthropogenic methane (CH4) source at the global scale. Previous inventories of this source for China were based on the accounting of livestock populations and constant emission factors (EFs) per head. Here, we re-evaluate how livestock CH4 emissions have changed from China over the last three decades, considering increasing population, body weight and milk production per head which cause EF to change with time, and decreasing average life span (ALS) of livestock. Our results show that annual CH4 emissions by livestock have increased from 4.5 to 11.8 Tg CH4 yr(-1) over the period 1980-2013. The increasing trend in emissions (0.25 Tg CH4 yr(-2)) over this period is 12% larger than that if using constant EFs and ALE. The increasing livestock population, production per head and decreasing ALS contributed + 91%, + 28% and -19% to the increase in CH4 emissions from livestock, respectively. This implies that the temporal changes in EF and ALS of livestock cannot be overlooked in inventories, especially in countries like China where livestock production systems are experiencing rapid transformations.

AB Monoterpenes react with nitrate radicals (NO3), contributing substantially to nighttime organic aerosol (OA) production. In this study, the role of reactions of monoterpenes + NO3 in forming biogenic secondary organic aerosol (BSOA) was examined using the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model, with extended emission profiles of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs), speciesspecific representations of BSOA production from individual monoterpenes and updated aerosol yields for monoterpene + NO3. The model results were compared to detailed measurements from the Southern Oxidants and Aerosol Study (SOAS) at Centreville, Alabama. With the more detailed model, monoterpene-derived BSOA increased by similar to 1 mu g m(-3) at night, accounting for one-third of observed lessoxidized oxygenated OA (LO-OOA), more closely agreeing with observations (lower error, stronger correlation). Implementation of a multigenerational oxidation approach resulted in the model capturing elevated OA episodes. With the aging model, aged semivolatile organic compounds (ASVOCs) contributed over 60% of the monoterpene-derived BSOA, followed by SOA formation via nitrate radical chemistry, making up to 34% of that formed at night. Among individual monoterpenes, A-pinene and limonene contributed most to the monoterpene-derived BSOA from nighttime reactions.

AB The long-term characteristics of submicron particles (PM1) over Shanghai and their contributing factors (including precursor gases and meteorological variables), as well as their impact on visibility, were investigated using in situ measurements from Jan 1st, 2015, to Dec 31st, 2016. A discretization method was introduced to identify the impact of each contributing factor on PM1. The results show that the annual mean PM1 concentration over Shanghai is similar to 28 mu gm(-3), which accounts for 69% of fine particles (PM2.5). The PM1 concentration shows obvious temporal variations on the scales of days, weeks, months, and years. Its diurnal pattern shows higher values in the daytime (with two peaks) than in the nighttime, which is different from the pattern for PM2.5 with high/low values in the nighttime/daytime. During a week, the PM1 concentration is the lowest on Tuesday and the highest on Friday. The discretized approach reveals that PM1 shows good linear relationships with its gaseous precursors and with meteorological variables under most conditions. The concentration of PM1 increases with increases in SO2, NO2, and NO (< 34 ppb) with slopes of 3.37, 1.17, and 1.08 mu gm(-3) per ppb precursor, respectively. This approach and the slopes were confirmed by the comparison of the observed and calculated PM1 changes with the day of the week. PM1 is negatively (positively) correlated with ozone (O-3) when O-3 is < 30 (> 30) ppb. PM1 are negatively correlated with precipitation intensity, relative humidity (RH, > 35%), and wind speed (> 1.5 ms(-1)), and their rates of decrease are 3.3, 0.26, and 5.9 mu gm(-3) per 1 mmh(-1), 1%, and 1 ms(-1), respectively. Other factors (e.g., temperature and pressure) show nonlinear relationships with PM1 concentration, presumably due to their indirect influence on the transport, formation, or accumulation of PM1. The PM1 concentration has a distinct impact on visibility, and the PM1/PM2.5 ratio is a key indicator to represent the impact of particulate matter hygroscopicity on visibility. The PM1/PM2.5 ratio shows. an exponential relationship (i.e., PM1/PM2.5 = 0.76 [(1-RH)/(1-40%)](0.11)) with RH with a determination coefficient of 0.98. This parameter combined with the PM2.5 concentration well describes the impact of particulate matter and its hygroscopicity on visibility.

AB Air pollution in urban atmosphere directly affects public-health; therefore, it is very essential to predict air pollutant concentrations. Air quality is a complex function of emissions, meteorology and topography, and artificial neural networks (ANNs) provide a sound framework for relating these variables. In this study, we investigated the feasibility of using ANN model with meteorological parameters as input variables to predict ozone concentration in the urban area of Jinan, a metropolis in Northern China. We firstly found that the architecture of network of neurons had little effect on the predicting capability of ANN model. A parsimonious ANN model with 6 routinely monitored meteorological parameters and one temporal covariate (the category of day, i.e. working day, legal holiday and regular weekend) as input variables was identified, where the 7 input variables were selected following the forward selection procedure. Compared with the benchmarking ANN model with 9 meteorological and photochemical parameters as input variables, the predicting capability of the parsimonious ANN model was acceptable. Its predicting capability was also verified in term of warming success ratio during the pollution episodes. Finally, uncertainty and sensitivity analysis were also performed based on Monte Carlo simulations (MCS). It was concluded that the ANN could properly predict the ambient ozone level. Maximum temperature, atmospheric pressure, sunshine duration and maximum wind speed were identified as the predominate input variables significantly influencing the prediction of ambient ozone concentrations.

AB Epidemiological studies generally use particulate matter measurements with diameter less 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) from monitoring networks. Satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) data has considerable potential in predicting PM2.5 concentrations, and thus provides an alternative method for producing knowledge regarding the level of pollution and its health impact in areas where no ground PM2.5 measurements are available. This is the case in the Brazilian Amazon rainforest region where forest fires are frequent sources of high pollution. In this study, we applied a non-linear model for predicting PM2.5 concentration from AOD retrievals using interaction terms between average temperature, relative humidity, sine, cosine of date in a period of 365,25 days and the square of the lagged relative residual. Regression performance statistics were tested comparing the goodness of fit and R-2 based on results from linear regression and non-linear regression for six different models. The regression results for non-linear prediction showed the best performance, explaining on average 82% of the daily PM2.5 concentrations when considering the whole period studied. In the context of Amazonia, it was the first study predicting PM2.5 concentrations using the latest high-resolution AOD products also in combination with the testing of a non-linear model performance. Our results permitted a reliable prediction considering the AOD-PM2.5 relationship and set the basis for further investigations on air pollution impacts in the complex context of Brazilian Amazon Region.

AB Total OH reactivity, which gives the instantaneous loss rate of OH radicals due to reactive species, is an invaluable technique to understand regional air quality, as it gives the overall reactivity of the air mass, the fraction of each trace species reactive to OH, the fraction of missing sinks, O-3 formation potential, etc. Total OH reactivity measurement was conducted in a small suburban forest located similar to 30 km from Tokyo during the air quality study at field museum TAMA (AQUAS-TAMA) campaign in early autumn 2012 and summer 2013. The average measured OH reactivities during that autumn and summer were 7.4 s(-1) and 11.4 s(-1), respectively. In summer, isoprene was the major contributor, accounting for 28.2% of the OH reactivity, as a result of enhanced light-dependent biogenic emission, whereas NO2 was major contributor in autumn, accounting for 19.6%, due to the diminished contribution from isoprene as a result of lower solar strength. Higher missing OH reactivity 34% was determined in summer, and linear regression analysis showed that oxygenated VOCs could be the potential candidates for missing OH reactivity. Lower missing OH reactivity 25% was determined in autumn and it was significantly reduced (11%) if the interference of peroxy radicals to the measured OH reactivity were considered.

AB We analyzed the ozone (O-3) profile product (PROFOZ) derived from Ozone Monitoring Instrument(OMI) ultraviolet (UV) spectra to reveal spatial and temporal variations in O-3 distributions over China. Although discriminating vertical O-3 in the lower troposphere is a challenge for satellite-borne measurements, previous research has confirmed the reliability of the lowermost layer O-3 of the PROFOZ product, corresponding to 0-3 km, under the high O-3 condition over China by comparison with the airborne measurements. In the present study, we focus on the seasonal variation of O-3 obtained in the lowermost layer over China. We track the O-3 enhancement under polluted conditions by using the ozone anomaly (Delta O-3), defined as the difference between the retrieval values and a priori values, because our focus is the temporally high O-3 level compared with the background level. We divide the 25-40 degrees N and 100-135 degrees E region into clusters according to the similarity of the seasonal variation in Delta O-3 at the lowermost layer corresponding to approximately 0-3 km in altitude. Using this cluster analysis, we distinguish the areas in which Delta O-3 has outstanding seasonality with high values in summer, particularly in June, and low values in winter over the North China Plain and Sichuan basin. The areas with these anomalous Delta O-3 values correspond to high NO2 emission areas. We compare the results with model simulations from the Meteorological Research Institute-Chemistry Climate Model (MRI-CCM2) and meteorological data. The areas showing outstanding seasonality also correspond to those of high chemical production rates in June. Along the coastal area, Delta O-3 values tend to drop to negative in August, which can be attributed to the inflow of clean oceanic air to inland regions. The results presented here again demonstrate the reliability of the lower tropospheric O-3 data from the OMI PROFOZ product and suggest good capability of UV satellite sensors for monitoring O-3 pollution that will be launched in the near future.

AB In this work we use cluster analysis of long term particle size distribution data to expand an array of different shorter term atmospheric measurements, thereby gaining insights into longer term patterns and properties of Arctic aerosol. Measurements of aerosol number size distributions (9-915 nm) were conducted at Villum Research Station (VRS), Station Nord in North Greenland during a 5 year record (2012-2016). Alongside this, measurements of aerosol composition, meteorological parameters, gaseous compounds and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activity were performed during different shorter occasions. K-means clustering analysis of particle number size distributions on daily basis identified several clusters. Clusters of accumulation mode aerosols (main size modes > 100 nm) accounted for 56% of the total aerosol during the sampling period (89-91% during February-April, 1-3% during June-August). By association to chemical composition, cloud condensation nuclei properties, and meteorological variables, three typical accumulation mode aerosol clusters were identified: Haze (32% of the time), Bimodal (14%) and Aged (6%). In brief: (1) Haze accumulation mode aerosol shows a single mode at 150 nm, peaking in February-April, with highest loadings of sulfate and black carbon concentrations. (2) Accumulation mode Bimodal aerosol shows two modes, at 38 nm and 150 nm, peaking in June-August, with the highest ratio of organics to sulfate concentrations. (3) Aged accumulation mode aerosol shows a single mode at 213 nm, peaking in September-October and is associated with cloudy and humid weather conditions during autumn. The three aerosol clusters were considered alongside CCN concentrations. We suggest that organic compounds, that are likely marine biogenic in nature, greatly influence the Bimodal cluster and contribute significantly to its CCN activity. This stresses the importance of better characterizing the marine ecosystem and the aerosol-mediated climate effects in the Arctic.

AB The PM2.5 is the culprit of air pollution, and it leads to respiratory system disease when the fine particles are inhaled. Therefore, it is increasingly significant to develop an effective model for PM2.5 forecasting and warnings that informs people to foresee the air quality. People can reduce outdoor activities and take preventive measures if they know the air quality is bad ahead of time. In addition, reliable forecasting results can remind the relevant departments to control and reduce pollutants discharge. According to our knowledge, the current hybrid forecasting techniques of PM2.5 do not take the meteorological factors into consideration. Actually, meteorological factors affect the concentrations of air pollution, but it is unclear whether meteorological factors are helpful for improving the PM2.5 forecasting results or not. This paper proposes a hybrid model called CEEMD-PSOGSA-SVR-GRNN, based on complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD), particle swarm optimization and gravitational search algorithm (PSOGSA), support vector regression (SVR), generalized regression neural network (GRNN) and grey correlation analysis (GCA), for the daily PM2.5 concentrations forecasting. The main steps of proposed model are described as follows: the original PM2.5 data decomposition with CEEMD, optimal SVR selection with PSOGCA, meteorological factors selection with GCA, residual revision by GRNN and forecasting results analysis. Three cities (Chongqing, Harbin and Jinan) in China with different characteristics of climate, terrain and pollution sources are selected to verify the effectiveness of proposed model, and CEEMD-PSOGSA-SVR*, EEMD-PSOGSA-SVR, PSOGSA-SVR, CEEMD-PSO-SVR, CEEMD-GSA-SVR, CEEMD-GWO-SVR are considered to be compared models. The experimental results show that the hybrid CEEMD-PSOGSA-SVR-GRNN model outperforms other six compared models. Therefore, the proposed CEEMD-PSOGSA-SVR-GRNN model can be used to develop air quality forecasting and warnings.

AB Emission inventory of pollutants is essential for the environmental fate study and management of the pollutant. To construct a reasonable PCB (polychlorinated biphenyls) inventory in China, this study estimates PCB usage and emission using power generating capacity, installed capacity of power plants and transformer substations, population density and GDP as surrogates. Inventory of representative PCB (PCB-153) with a resolution of 1/4(degrees) latitude x 1/4(degrees) longitude in China from 1952 to 2005 was generated and assessed as an example. Totally, about 20.3 kt PCBs were applied in China, of which 179 t were PCB-153. By the end of 2005, most of them (56.4%) were emitted into the soil, 2.7% entered the air, and about 20.8% was sealed in storage site or still in service. Historical emissions exhibited increasing trends after 1968, 1984 and 1994, which were mainly associated with usage or disposal processes. Although primary emission has been declined since 2005, the influence of secondary emission from soils, unintentionally produced PCBs (UP-PCB), and reemission from storage sites could be a longlasting issue in the future. This new emission inventory improves previous PCB emission inventory significantly, which underestimated PCB emission in China considerably.

AB A field observation focusing on reactive oxygen species (ROS) was conducted before, during, and after the 2015 China Victory Day Parade to understand the influence of short-term emissions controls on atmospheric oxidative activity. The hourly average concentrations of PM2.5, SO2, NO, NO2, CO, O-3, as well as gas and particle-phase ROS, were measured using a series of online instruments. PM2.(5) concentrations during control days were significantly lower than non-control days, which directly lead to the "Parade Blue", yet reductions of most gaseous pollutants except SO2 were not so obvious as PM. Similarly, the control measures also led to a great loss of particle-phase ROS throughout the control period, while the reduction of ROS in gas phase was not obvious until the more stringent measures implemented since September 1. Furthermore, only weak positive correlations were observed among ROS and some other measured species, indicating ROS concentrations were affected by a number of comprehensive factors that single marker could not capture. Meanwhile, meteorological condition and regional transportation were also shown to be the minor factors affecting atmospheric oxidizing capacity. The results of this observation mainly revealed the control measures were conducive to reducing particle-related ROS. However, the reduction of gas-phase ROS activity was less effective given the menu of controls employed for the 2015 China Victory Day Parade. Therefore, short-term emissions controls only aimed to PM reduction and visibility improvement will produce the blue sky but will not equivalently reduce the gas-phase ROS. Supplemental control measures will be needed to further reduce gas-phase ROS concentrations.

TI A national-scale review of air pollutant concentrations measured in the

AB In 2010, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) revised the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for NO2 to include a primary health-based standard for hourly NO2, and required air quality monitoring next to major roadways in urban areas in the U.S. Requirements for near-road measurements also include carbon monoxide (CO) and particulate matter smaller than 2.5 mu m in diameter (PM2.5). We performed a national-scale assessment of air pollutants measured at 81 sites in the near-road environment during the first two years (2014 and 2015) of the new measurement program. We evaluated how concentrations at these locations compared to the NAAQS, to concentrations measured at other sites within the same urban areas, and when considering their site characteristics (distance of monitor to road, traffic volume, and meteorology). We also estimated the contribution of emissions from adjacent roadways at each near-road site to the PM2.5 concentrations above the local urban background concentrations, i.e., the near-road "increment." Hourly values of CO reached a maximum of 4.8 ppm across 31 sites in 2014 and 9.6 ppm across 47 sites in 2015, and were well below the NAAQS levels for both the 1-hr (35 ppm) and 8-hr (9 ppm) standards. Hourly concentrations of near road NO2 reached 258 ppb across 40 sites in 2014; however, there were only two occurrences of a daily 1-hr maximum NO2 concentration above 100 ppb (the level of the hourly NO2 standard). In 2015, hourly concentrations of near-road NO2, monitored at 61 sites in 55 urban areas, reached 154 ppb. Only 0.0015% (n = 5) of hourly NO2 observations in 2015 exceeded 100 ppb. The highest annual NO2 average recorded in 2015 (29.9 ppb) occurred at the Ontario site located along I-10 in the Los Angeles, California, area and was below the level of the NO2 annual standard (53 ppb); in 2014, the highest annual mean NO2 was also observed in Los Angeles at the Anaheim site (27.1 ppb). In 2014, sites in Cincinnati, Indianapolis, and Louisville recorded annual average PM2.5 concentrations at or above 12 mu g/m(3) (the level of the annual standard). There were 15 occurrences in 2014 of 24-hr PM2.5 concentrations above the NAAQS level of 35 mu g/m(3). Annual average PM2.5 exceeded 12 mu g/m(3) at near-road sites in five urban areas in 2015, and there were 33 days across 12 near-road locations with 24-hr PM2.5 concentrations above 35 mu g/m(3). Across the near-road monitoring network, annual average PM2.5 concentrations did not have a significant relationship with traffic volume or distance between the monitor and the adjacent roadway; rather, variations in PM2.5 were mostly driven by urban-scale PM2.5, with a typically small "increment" above urban-scale concentrations due to a site's proximity to the roadway. We estimated this increment, i.e., the difference between near-road PM2.5 concentrations and the concentrations at sites in the urban area of each near-road monitor, to be on average 1.2 mu g/m(3) (sigma = 0.3 mu g/m(3)), with a range of -1.2 mu g/m(3) to 3.1 mu g/m(3) across the 26 sites (four of which had a negative increment). The near-road increment is on average 13% of the near-road PM2.5, and 15% of the near-road PM2.5 for sites within 20 m of the roadway.

AB Atmospheric peroxides play important roles in atmospheric chemistry, acting as reactive oxidants and reservoirs of HOx and ROx radicals. Field measurements of atmospheric peroxides were conducted over urban Beijing from 2015 to 2016, including dust storm days, haze days and different seasons. We employed a box model based on RACM2 mechanism to conduct concentration simulation and budget analysis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and peroxyacetic acid (PAA). In this study, heterogeneous reaction is found to be a significant sink for atmospheric H2O2 and PAA in urban Beijing. Here, we recommend a suitable uptake coefficient formula considering the water effect for model research of peroxides. It is found that H2O2 and PAA unexpectedly maintained considerable concentrations on haze days, even higher than that on non-haze days. This phenomenon is mainly ascribed to relatively high levels of volatile organic compounds and ozone on haze days. In addition, high levels of water vapor in pollution episode can promote not only the heterogeneous uptake to aerosol phase but also the production of H2O2. Atmospheric PAA formation is suggested to be sensitive to alkenes and NOx in urban Beijing. In particular, with the help of peroxides, sulfate formation rate from heterogeneous uptake could increase by similar to 4 times on haze days, indicating the potential effect of peroxides on enhancement of aerosol oxidative property and secondary sulfate formation.

AB The accurate measurements of natural and anthropogenic aerosol particulate matter (PM) is important in managing both environmental and health risks; however, limited monitoring in regional areas hinders accurate quantification. This article provides an overview of the ability of recently launched geostationary earth orbit (GEO) satellites, such as GOES-R (North America) and HIMAWARI (Asia and Oceania), to provide near real-time ground-level PM concentrations (GLCs). The review examines the literature relating to the spatial and temporal resolution required by air quality studies, the removal of cloud and surface effects, the aerosol inversion problem, and the computation of ground-level concentrations rather than columnar aerosol optical depth (AOD).
   Determining surface PM concentrations using remote sensing is complicated by differentiating intrinsic aerosol properties (size, shape, composition, and quantity) from extrinsic signal intensities, particularly as the number of unknown intrinsic parameters exceeds the number of known extrinsic measurements. The review confirms that development of GEO satellite products has led to improvements in the use of coupled products such as GEOS-CHEM, aerosol types have consolidated on model species rather than prior descriptive classifications, and forward radiative transfer models have led to a better understanding of predictive spectra inter-dependencies across different aerosol types, despite fewer wavelength bands. However, it is apparent that the aerosol inversion problem remains challenging because there are limited wavelength bands for characterising localised mineralogy.
   The review finds that the frequency of GEO satellite data exceeds the temporal resolution required for air quality studies, but the spatial resolution is too coarse for localised air quality studies. Continual monitoring necessitates using the less sensitive thermal infra-red bands, which also reduce surface absorption effects. However, given the challenges of the aerosol inversion problem and difficulties in converting columnar AOD to surface concentrations, the review identifies coupled GEO-neural networks as potentially the most viable option for improving quantification.

AB Over the past decades, mitigation strategies have been adopted both by federal and state agencies in the United States (US) to improve air quality. Between 2007 and 2009, the US faced a financial/economic crisis that lowered activity and reduced emissions. At the same time, changes in the prices of coal and natural gas drove a shift in fuels used for electricity generation. Seasonal patterns, diel cycles, spatial gradients, and trends in PM2.5 and gaseous pollutants concentrations (NOx, SO2, CO and O-3) monitored in New York State (NYS) from 2005 to 2016 were examined. Relationships between ambient concentrations, changes in NYS emissions retrieved from the US EPA trends inventory, and economic indicators were studied. PM2.5 and primary gaseous pollutants concentrations decreased across NYS. By 2016, PM2.5 and SO2 attained relatively homogeneous concentrations across the state. PM2.5 concentrations decreased significantly at all sites. Similarly, SO2 concentrations declined at all sites within this period, with the highest slopes observed at the urban sites. Reductions in NOx emissions likely contributed to summertime average ozone reductions. NOx and VOCs controls reduced O-3 peak concentrations as seen in significant relationships between the annual o(3) 4th-highest daily maximum 8-h concentrations and estimated NOx emissions at rural and suburban sites (r(2) similar to 0.7). Spring maxima were not reduced with most sites showing insignificant slopes or significant positive slopes (e.g., +2.6% y(-1) and +2% y(-1), at CCNY and PFI, respectively). Increases in autumn and winter ozone concentrations were found (e.g., 6.6 +/- 0.4% y(-1) on average in New York City). Significant relationships were observed between PM2.5, primary pollutants, and economic indicators. Overall, a decrease in electricity generation with coal, and the simultaneous increase in natural gas consumption for power generation, led to a decrease in PM2.5 and gaseous pollutants concentrations.

   METHODOLOGY
AB Atmospheric haze pollution has become a global concern because of its severe effects on human health and the environment. The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration is located in northern China, and its haze is the most serious in China. The high concentration of PM2.5 is the main cause of haze pollution, and thus investigating the temporal and spatial characteristics of PM2.5 is important for understanding the mechanisms underlying PM2.5 pollution and for preventing haze. In this study, the PM2.5 concentration status in 13 cities from the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region was statistically analyzed from January 2016 to November 2016, and the spatial variation of PM2.5 was explored via spatial autocorrelation analysis. The research yielded three overall results. (1) The distribution of PM2.5 concentrations in this area varied greatly during the study period. The concentrations increased from late autumn to early winter, and the spatial range expanded from southeast to northwest. In contrast, the PM2.5 concentration decreased rapidly from late winter to early spring, and the spatial range narrowed from northwest to southeast. (2) The spatial dependence degree, by season from high to low, was in the order winter, autumn, spring, summer. Winter (from December to February of the subsequent year) and summer (from June to August) were, respectively, the highest and lowest seasons with regard to the spatial homogeneity of PM2.5 concentrations. (3) The PM2.5 concentration in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region has significant spatial spillovers. Overall, cities far from Bohai Bay, such as Shijiazhuang and Hengshui, demonstrated a high-high concentration of PM2.5 pollution, while coastal cities, such as Chengde and Qinhuangdao, showed a low-low concentration.

AB A comparison was made between the relative performance of active and passive sampling methods for the analysis of 1,3-butadiene in outdoor air. Active and passive sampling was conducted using multi-sorbent bed tubes (Carbotrap, Carbopack X, Carboxen 569) and RAD141 Radiello (R) diffusive samplers (filled with Carbopack X), respectively. Daily duplicate samples of multi-sorbent bed tubes were taken over a period of 14 days (9 + 5 days) at El Morell (Tarragona, Spain), near the petrochemical area. As 1,3-butadiene is a reactive pollutant and can be rapidly oxidized, half of the samplers were equipped with ozone scrubbers. Samples consisted in two tubes connected in series (front and back) to allow the determination of breakthrough. Quadruplicate samples of Radiello (R) tubes were taken over a period of 14 days (9 days and 5 days), too. During those days, ozone concentration was measured using RAD172 Radiello (R). samplers. In addition to this, daily duplicate samples of multi-sorbent bed tubes were taken in the city of Barcelona over a period of 8 days. Simultaneously, 4 samples of Radiello (R) tubes were exposed to outdoor air. Sampling was done throughout June and July 2017. Analysis was performed by thermal desorption coupled with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Analytical performance of the two sampling methods was evaluated by describing several quality assurance parameters, with results showing that performances are quite similar. They display low detection limits, good precision, linearity and desorption efficiency, low levels of blank values, and low breakthrough for multi-sorbent bed tubes. However, Radiello (R) samplers were not able to uptake episodic 1,3-butadiene high concentrations, leading to underestimation of real values. Hence, we can conclude that Radiello (R) samplers can be used for baseline 1,3-butadiene levels whereas multi-sorbent bed tubes would be advisable when relevant episodes are expected.

AB Daya Bay in the South China Sea (SCS) has experienced rapid nitrogen pollution and intensified eutrophication in the past decade due to economic development. Here, we estimated the deposition fluxes of nitrogenous species, clarified the contribution of nitrogen from precipitation and measured ions and isotopic composition (delta N-15 and delta O-18) of nitrate in precipitation in one year period to trace its sources and formation processes among different seasons. We found that the deposition fluxes of total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), NO3-, NH4+, NO2-, and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) to Daya Bay were 132.5, 64.4 17.5, 1.0, 49.6 mmol m(-2.)yr(-1), respectively. DON was a significant contributor to nitrogen deposition (37% of TDN), and NO3- accounted for 78% of the DIN in precipitation. The nitrogen deposition fluxes were higher in spring and summer, and lower in winter. Nitrogen from precipitation contributed nearly 38% of the total input of nitrogen (point sources input and dry and wet deposition) in Daya Bay. The delta N-15-NO3- abundance, ion compositions, and air mass backward trajectories implicated that coal combustion, vehicle exhausts, and dust from mainland China delivered by northeast monsoon were the main sources in winter, while fossil fuel combustion (coal combustion and vehicle exhausts) and dust from PRD and southeast Asia transported by southwest monsoon were the main sources in spring; marine sources, vehicle exhausts and lightning could be the potential sources in summer. delta O-18 results showed that OH pathway was dominant in the chemical formation process of nitrate in summer, while N2O5 + DMS/HC pathways in winter and spring.

AB Atmospheric ammonia plays an important role in haze formation in East China. In this study, long-term measurements of NH3 concentrations were implemented at urban, suburban, and tunnel sites in Shanghai, the largest city in East China. The average monthly ammonia concentrations at the urban site varied from 3.7 ppb to 14.5 ppb and exhibited the highest levels in summer and lowest levels in winter, indicating that the biological emissions and agriculture in the surrounding areas are important contributors. The suburban NH3 levels were significantly higher in autumn compared to those at the urban site, indicating the important contribution of agricultural activities. Regardless of the season, the difference of NH3 concentrations between the tunnel and urban sites remained almost constant. On average, the tunnel NH3 level was three times higher than that of the nearby urban site, indicating strong vehicle NH3 emissions in the tunnel. The tunnel NH3 levels on weekdays were comparable to those on weekends, a result that was in agreement with the daily average traffic volume. It was estimated that the vehicle emissions contributed 12.6-24.6% of the atmospheric NH3 in the urban area and 3.8-7.5% for the whole area of Shanghai. Our results suggest that vehicle NH3 emissions should be considered, although agricultural emissions are still more important for mitigating severe haze pollution during wintertime in the megacities of China.

AB As one of the highest energy consumption and pollution industries, the iron and steel industry is regarded as a most important source of particulate matter emission. In this study, chemical components of size-segregated particulate matters (PM) emitted from different manufacturing units in iron and steel industry were sampled by a comprehensive sampling system. Results showed that the average particle mass concentration was highest in sintering process, followed by puddling, steelmaking and then rolling processes. PM samples were divided into eight size fractions for testing the chemical components, S(O4)(2- )and NH4+ distributed more into fine particles while most of the Ca2+ was concentrated in coarse particles, the size distribution of mineral elements depended on the raw materials applied. Moreover, local database with PM chemical source profiles of iron and steel industry were built and applied in CMAQ modeling for simulating SO42- and NO3- concentration, results showed that the accuracy of model simulation improved with local chemical source profiles compared to the SPECIATE database. The results gained from this study are expected to be helpful to understand the components of PM in iron and steel industry and contribute to the source apportionment researches.

AB Knowledge of black carbon (BC) emission factors from ships is important from human health and environmental perspectives. A study of instruments measuring BC and fuels typically used in marine operation was carried out on a small marine engine. Six analytical methods measured the BC emissions in the exhaust of the marine engine operated at two load points (25% and 75%) while binning one of three fuels: a distillate marine (DMA), a low sulfur, residual marine (RMB-30) and a high-sulfur residual marine (RMG-380). The average emission factors with all instruments increased from 0.08 to 1.88 gBC/kg fuel in going from 25 to 75% load. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) tested BC emissions against instrument, load, and combined fuel properties and showed that both engine load and fuels had a statistically significant impact on BC emission factors. While BC emissions were impacted by the fuels used, none of the fuel properties investigated (sulfur content, viscosity, carbon residue and CCAI) was a primary driver for BC emissions. Of the two residual fuels, RMB-30 with the lower sulfur content, lower viscosity and lower residual carbon, had the highest BC emission factors. BC emission factors determined with the different instruments showed a good correlation with the PAS values with correlation coefficients R2 > 0.95. A key finding of this research is the relative BC measured values were mostly independent of load and fuel, except for some instruments in certain fuel and load combinations.

AB An occupational sampling campaign was conducted in the city of Londrina, Parand, during an eleven-week period of the dry season (spring) of 2015. To assess worker exposure, concentrations of black carbon (BC), fine particles (< 2.g5 mu m) and particle number counts (PNC, between 0.01 and 1.0 mu m), total volatile organic compounds (TVOCs) and ozone (O-3) were monitored at a 1-min resolution within seven occupational microenvironments for an entire working week (similar to 45 h in each location). Workplace observations were supported by simultaneous collection of BC, PM2.5, PNC, O-3 and meteorological variables at an urban background site. In order to distinguish between immediate local sources and wide-area influences on worker exposures, the contribution of long-range transport (LRT) from fire events was assessed using air mass back trajectory and satellite fire spot analyses. A total of fifteen environmental variables influencing workplace exposures were tested using multiple regression models and exposure differences between occupations were assessed using non-parametric tests. Although the environmental settings differed substantially, weekly median exposures were similar, with the exception of occupations involving significant indoor sources and those proximate to heavy traffic. Median TVOC exposure was 8 (3,351, range 17-77,530 ppb, p < 0.001) and 3.5 times higher (1,616, range 0.3-18,861 ppb, p < 0.001) at a shoe repair store and hair salon, respectively, than in a clean office environment situated directly within the city centre (414, range 0.5-4844 ppb). Similarly, median BC concentrations were 2.8 (3.7, range 1.2-27.8 mu g/m(3), p < 0.001) times greater inside a street canyon drug store and elevated by a factor of 3.0 (3.8, range 0.4-39.6 mu g/m(3), p < 0.001), on a local commuter bus, than in the office environment (1.3 mu g/m(3)). These results hold important implications for workplace exposure and can aid in informing potential mitigation strategies, such as a review of ventilation configurations and hazardous materials used in certain occupations.

AB PM2.5 concentrations increased and have been one of the major social issues along with rapid urbanization in many regions of the world in recent decades. The development of urbanization differed among regions, PM2.5 pollution also presented discrepant distribution across the world. Thus, this paper aimed to grasp the profile of global distribution of urbanization and PM2.5 and their evolutionary relationships. Based on global data for the proportion of the urban population and PM2.5 concentrations in 1998-2015, this paper investigated the spatial distribution, temporal variation, and evolutionary relationships of global urbanization and PM2.5. The results showed PM2.5 presented an increasing trend along with urbanization during the study period, but there was a variety of evolutionary relationships in different countries and regions. Most countries in East Asia, Southeast Asia, South Asia, and some African countries developed with the rapid increase in both urbanization and PM2.5 Under the impact of other socioeconomic factors, such as industry and economic growth, the development of urbanization increased PM2.5 concentrations in most Asian countries and some African countries, but decreased PM2.5 concentrations in most European and American countries. The findings of this study revealed the spatial distributions of global urbanization and PM2.5 pollution and provided an interpretation on the evolution of urbanization-PM2.5 relationships, which can contribute to urbanization policies making aimed at successful PM2.5 pollution control and abatement.

AB Vegetation including canopy, grasslands, and shrublands can directly sequester pollutants onto the plant surface, resulting in an improvement in air quality. Until now, several studies have estimated the pollution removal capacity of canopy cover at the level of a county, but no such work exists for grasslands and shrublands. This work quantifies the air pollution removal capacity of grasslands and shrublands at the county-level in the United States and estimates the human health benefits associated with pollution removal using the i-Tree Eco model. Sequestration of pollutants is estimated based on the Leaf Area Index (LAI) obtained from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) derived dataset estimates of LAI and the percentage land cover obtained from the National Land Cover Database (NLCD) for the year 2010. Calculation of pollution removal capacity using local environmental data indicates that grasslands and shrublands remove a total of 6.42 million tonnes of air pollutants in the United States and the associated monetary benefits total $268 million. Human health impacts and associated monetary value due to pollution removal was observed to be significantly high in urban areas indicating that grasslands and shrublands are equally critical as canopy in improving air quality and human health in urban regions.

AB Zhoushan is an island city with booming tourism and service industry, but also has many developed VOCs and/or NOx emission industries. It is necessary to carry out regional VOCs and O-3 pollution control in Zhoushan as the only new area owns the provincial economic and social administration rights. Anthropogenic VOCs emission inventories were built based on emission factor method and main emission sources were identified according to the emission inventories. Then, localized VOCs source profiles were built based on in-site sampling and referring to other studies. Furthermore, ozone formation potentials (OFPs) profiles were built through VOCs source profiles and maximum incremental reactivity (MIR) theory. At last, the priority control analysis results showed that industrial processes, especially surface coating, are the key of VOCs and O-3 control. Alkanes were the most emitted group, accounting for 58.67%, while aromatics contributed the most to ozone production accounting for 69.97% in total OFPs. n-butane, m/p-xylene, i-pentane, n-decane, toluene, propane, n-undecane, o-xylene, methyl cyclohexane and ethyl benzene were the top 10 VOC species that should be preferentially controlled for VOCs emission control. However, m/p-xylene, o-xylene, ethylene, n-butane, toluene, propene, 1,2,4-trimethyl benzene, 1,3,5-trimethyl benzene, ethyl benzene and 1,2,3-trimethyl benzene were the top 10 VOC species that required preferential control for O-3 pollution control.

AB Nitrous acid (HONO) is a key reservoir of the hydroxyl radical (OH) and plays a central role in the atmospheric chemistry. To understand the sources and impact of HONO in the polluted atmosphere of northern China, continuous measurements of HONO and related parameters were conducted from September 2015 to August 2016 at an urban site in Ji'nan, the capital city of Shandong province. HONO showed well-defined seasonal and diurnal variation patterns with clear wintertime and nighttime concentration peaks. Elevated HONO concentrations (e.g., over 5 ppbv) were frequently observed with a maximum value of 8.36 ppbv. The HONO/NOx ratios of direct vehicle emissions varied in the range of 0.29%-0.87%, with a mean value of 0.53%. An average NO2-to-HONO nighttime conversion frequency (k(het)) was derived to be 0.0068 +/- 0.0045 h(-1) from 107 HONO formation cases. A detailed HONO budget analysis suggests an unexplained daytime missing source of 2.95 ppb h(-1) in summer, which is about seven times larger than the homogeneous reaction of NO with OH. The effect of HONO on OH production was also quantified. HONO photolysis was the uppermost source of local OH radical throughout the daytime. This study provides the year-round continuous record of ambient HONO in the North China Plain, and offers some insights into the characteristics, sources and impacts of HONO in the polluted atmospheres of China.

AB Paired indoor and outdoor measurements of 16 NPAHs and 5 OPAHs in PM2.5 were conducted at urban and suburban sites during January 2016 in Jinan, China. The concentrations of both indoor and outdoor NPAHs and OPAHs were higher at the urban site compared with the suburban site. 9N-ANT (16-42%), 2 + 3N-FLA (15-51%), 2N-PYR (6-20%), and 1N-PYR (4-6%) were the dominant NPAHs at all sites, and 9-FO (61-81%) was the most abundant OPAHs. Solid fuel combustion, motor vehicle exhausts, and secondary generation were the main sources of the PAH derivatives in this study area. The I/O ratios of 90% of NPAHs and OPAHs at the first urban indoor site (abbreviated as URI1, Green Tree Inn) and the suburban indoor site (abbreviated as SUI, the Seven Star Hotel) were < 1.00 indicating that many of the compounds measured indoors originated from outdoor sources. At the second urban indoor site (abbreviated as URI2, Shandong University Hotel), the I/O ratios of 2-and 3-ring NPAHs and OPAHs were > 1.00, which was likely due to cooking activities occurring near the measurement site. Measurements of outdoor 2 + 3N-FLA/1N-PYR revealed mainly primary emission at the urban site and secondary sources at the suburban site, the average ratios were 3.76 and 12.22, respectively. The average ratio of 2 + 3N-FLA/2N-PYR at all sites was 3.3, indicating that the OH-initiated reaction was the dominant secondary formation pathway. Nighttime ratios of 2 + 3N-FLA/1N-PYR were significantly higher than the daytime ratios at all sites. The difference was especially pronounced during heavily polluted conditions at the suburban site, which suggests that heavy pollution and nighttime conditions promote secondary production. Additionally, the cancer risk was highest in urban outdoor (abbreviated as URO) when the population expose to the level as the outdoor air in the urban. The risk suggested that adults may be at a higher cancer risk.

AB Atmospheric carbonyl sulfide (COS or OCS) is the most abundant sulfur containing gas in the troposphere and is an atmospheric tracer for the carbon cycle. Gridded inventories of global anthropogenic COS are used for interpreting global COS measurements. However, previous gridded anthropogenic data are a climatological estimate based on input data that is over three decades old and are not representative of current conditions. Here we develop a new gridded data set of global anthropogenic COS sources that includes more source sectors than previously available and uses the most current emissions factors and industry activity data as input. Additionally, the inventory is provided as annually varying estimates from years 1980-2012 and employs a source specific spatial scaling procedure. We estimate a global source in year 2012 of 406GgS y(-1) (range of 223-586 Gg S y(_1)), which is highly concentrated in China and is twice as large as the previous gridded inventory. Our large upward revision in the bottom-up estimate of the source is consistent with a recent top-down estimate based on air-monitoring and Antarctic firn data. Furthermore, our inventory time trends, including a decline in the 1990's and growth after the year 2000, are qualitatively consistent with trends in atmospheric data. Finally, similarities between the spatial distribution in this inventory and remote sensing data suggest that the anthropogenic source could potentially play a role in explaining a missing source in the global COS budget.

AB Nitrate-containing particles are ubiquitous in the troposphere because of their secondary production due to anthropogenic emissions of NOx from the combustion of fossil fuels. Nitrate ions are recognized as photoactive species that may contribute to the formation of oxidants in the atmosphere through heterogeneous photochemical reactions. The chemical transformation of aerosol particles in the atmosphere often leads to modification of the particles' hygroscopic properties. Although the photo-transformation of nitrate ions into nitrite within aerosol particles has been investigated, the influence of the photoproducts formation on the hygroscopic behavior of particles has not been reported. In this study, we examined the hygroscopic properties of single, ultraviolet-irradiated NaNO3 droplets using Raman microspectrometry. We are the first demonstrated that irradiating NaNO3 particles affects their hygroscopic behavior. For short-term exposures, regarding hygroscopic behavior, the irradiated particles exhibited two-stage transitions that were clearly reproduced in the experimental NaNO3-NaNO2 phase diagram. The production of NO2- decreased the deliquescence relative humidity values. For long irradiation times (> 5 h), these values are even more affected by the additional production of peroxynitrite and carbonate ions in individual droplets. The NaNO3-NaNO2 deliquescence phase diagram cannot explain the hygroscopic behavior of long-term irradiated particles. Finally, we demonstrated the influence that CO2 has on the photo-transformation process in NaNO3 droplets.

AB Vehicle emissions represent a major source of air pollution in urban districts, producing highly variable concentrations of some pollutants within cities. The main goal of this study was to identify a deconvolving method so as to characterize variability in local, neighbourhood and regional background concentration signals. This method was validated by examining how traffic-related and non-traffic-related sources influenced the different signals.
   Sampling with a mobile monitoring platform was conducted across the Greater Toronto Area over a seven-day period during summer 2015. This mobile monitoring platform was equipped with instruments for measuring a wide range of pollutants at time resolutions of 1 s (ultrafine particles, black carbon) to 20 s (nitric oxide, nitrogen oxides). The monitored neighbourhoods were selected based on their land use categories (e.g. industrial, commercial, parks and residential areas). The high time-resolution data allowed pollutant concentrations to be separated into signals representing background and local concentrations. The background signals were determined using a spline of minimums; local signals were derived by subtracting the background concentration from the total concentration.
   Our study showed that temporal scales of 500 s and 2400 s were associated with the neighbourhood and regional background signals respectively. The percent contribution of the pollutant concentration that was attributed to local signals was highest for nitric oxide (NO) (37-95%) and lowest for ultrafine particles (9-58%); the ultrafine particles were predominantly regional (32-87%) in origin on these days. Local concentrations showed stronger associations than total concentrations with traffic intensity in a 100 m buffer (p:0.21-0.44). The neighbourhood scale signal also showed stronger associations with industrial facilities than the total concentrations. Given that the signals show stronger associations with different land use suggests that resolving the ambient concentrations differentiates which emission sources drive the variability in each signal. The benefit of this deconvolution method is that it may reduce exposure misclassification when coupled with predictive models.

AB Biogenic isoprene emissions play a very important role in atmospheric chemistry. These emissions are strongly dependent on various environmental conditions, such as temperature, solar radiation, plant water stress, ambient ozone and CO2 concentrations, and soil moisture. Current biogenic emission models (i.e., Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature, MEGAN) can simulate emission responses to some of the major driving variables, such as short-term variations in temperature and solar radiation, but the other factors are either missing or poorly represented. In this paper, we propose a new modelling approach that considers the physiological effects of drought stress on plant photosynthesis and isoprene emissions for use in the MEGAN3 biogenic emission model. We test the MEGAN3 approach by integrating the algorithm into the existing MEGAN2.1 biogenic emission model framework embedded into the global Community Land Model of the Community Earth System Model (CLM4.5/CESM1.2). Single-point simulations are compared against available field measurements at the Missouri Ozarks AmeriFlux (MOFLUX) field site. The modelling results show that the MEGAN3 approach of using of a photosynthesis parameter (V-cmax) and soil wetness factor (beta(t))o determine the drought activity factor leads to better simulated isoprene emissions in non-drought and drought periods. The global simulation with the MEGAN3 approach predicts a 17% reduction in global annual isoprene emissions, in comparison to the value predicted using the default CLM4.5/MEGAN2.1 without any drought effect. This reduction leads to changes in surface ozone and oxidants in the areas where the reduction of isoprene emissions is observed. Based on the results presented in this study, we conclude that it is important to simulate the droughtin-duced response of biogenic isoprene emission accurately in the coupled Earth System model.

AB Air quality has significantly improved in Europe over the past few decades. Nonetheless we still find high concentrations in measurements mainly in specific regions or cities. This dimensional shift, from EU-wide to hotspot exceedances, calls for a novel approach to regional air quality management (to complement EU-wide existing policies). The SHERPA (Screening for High Emission Reduction Potentials on Air quality) modelling tool was developed in this context. It provides an additional tool to be used in support to regional/local decision makers responsible for the design of air quality plans. It is therefore important to evaluate the quality of the SHERPA model, and its behavior in the face of various kinds of uncertainty. Uncertainty and sensitivity analysis techniques can be used for this purpose. They both reveal the links between assumptions and forecasts, help inmodel simplification and may highlight unexpected relationships between inputs and outputs.
   Thus, a policy steered SHERPA module - predicting air quality improvement linked to emission reduction scenarios - was evaluated by means of (1) uncertainty analysis (UA) to quantify uncertainty in the model output, and (2) by sensitivity analysis (SA) to identify the most influential input sources of this uncertainty. The results of this study provide relevant information about the key variables driving the SHERPA output uncertainty, and advise policy-makers and modellers where to place their efforts for an improved decision-making process.

AB The aim of this study is to validate the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) erythemal dose rates using ground-based measurements in Thessaloniki, Greece. In the Laboratory of Atmospheric Physics of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, a Yankee Environmental System UVB-1 radiometer measures the erythemal dose rates every minute, and a Norsk Institutt for Luftforskning (NILU) multi-filter radiometer provides multi-filter based irradiances that were used to derive erythemal dose rates for the period 2005-2014. Both these datasets were independently validated against collocated UV irradiance spectra from a Brewer MkIII spectrophotometer. Cloud detection was performed based on measurements of the global horizontal radiation from a Kipp & Zonen pyranometer and from NILU measurements in the visible range. The satellite versus ground observation validation was performed taking into account the effect of temporal averaging, limitations related to OMI quality control criteria, cloud conditions, the solar zenith angle and atmospheric aerosol loading. Aerosol optical depth was also retrieved using a collocated CIMEL sunphotometer in order to assess its impact on the comparisons. The effect of total ozone columns satellite versus ground-based differences on the erythemal dose comparisons was also investigated. Since most of the public awareness alerts are based on UV Index (UVI) classifications, an analysis and assessment of OMI capability for retrieving UVIs was also performed.
   An overestimation of the OMI erythemal product by 3-6% and 4-8% with respect to ground measurements is observed when examining overpass and noontime estimates respectively. The comparisons revealed a relatively small solar zenith angle dependence, with the OMI data showing a slight dependence on aerosol load, especially at high aerosol optical depth values. A mean underestimation of 2% in OMI total ozone columns under cloud-free conditions was found to lead to an overestimation in OMI erythemal doses of 1-5%.While OMI overestimated the erythemal dose rates over the range of cloudiness conditions examined, its UVIs were found to be reliable for the purpose of characterizing the ambient UV radiation impact.

AB A case study is provided of the development and application of methods to identify and quantify specific sources of emissions from within a large complex industrial site. Methods include directional analysis of concentrations, chemical source tracers and correlations with gaseous emissions. Extensive measurements of PM10, PM2.5, trace gases, particulate elements and single particle mass spectra were made at sites around the Port Talbot steelworks in 2012. By using wind direction data in conjunction with real-time or hourly-average pollutant concentration measurements, it has been possible to locate areas within the steelworks associated with enhanced pollutant emissions. Directional analysis highlights the Slag Handling area of the works as the most substantial source of elevated PM10 concentrations during the measurement period. Chemical analyses of air sampled from relevant wind directions is consistent with the anticipated composition of slags, as are single particle mass spectra. Elevated concentrations of PM10 are related to inverse distance from the Slag Handling area, and concentrations increase with increased wind speed, consistent with a wind-driven resuspension source. There also appears to be a lesser source associated with Sinter Plant emissions affecting PM10 concentrations at the Fire Station monitoring site. The results are compared with a ME2 study using some of the same data, and shown to give a clearer view of the location and characteristics of emission sources, including fugitive dusts.

TI Insights into the degradation of (CF3)(2)CHOCH3 and its oxidative

AB In this work, a systematic investigation of the atmospheric oxidation mechanism of (CF3)(2)CXOCH3 and their oxidative products (CF3)(2)CXOCHO (X = H, F) initiated by OH radical or Cl atom is performed by density functional theory. This study reveals that the introduction of NO and O-2 promotes the formation of organic nitrates, which are hygroscopic and are inclined to form secondary organic aerosols (SOA) and can affect the air quality. The rate constants of the individual reactions are found to be in agreement with the experimental results. One of the intriguing findings of this work is that the peroxynitrite of (CF3)(2)CHOCH2OONO formed from the subsequent reactions of (CF3)(2)CHOCH3 is more favorable to isomerize to organic nitrate (CF3)(2)CH0CH(2)ONO(2) than to dissociate into alkoxy radical (CF3)(2)CH0CH(2)O and NO2 because of the lower energy barrier of isomerization. The second significant observation is that the organic nitrate can be degraded more favorably with the presence of NH3, CH3NH2, and CH3NHCH3 than its naked decomposition reaction (CF3)(2)CHOCH2ONO2 ->(CF3)(2)CHOCHO + HONO. The ammonium salt, a vital part of haze, is harmful to human health and can be formed in the existence of the NH3, CH3NH2, and CH3NHCH3. In addition, the toxic substance of peroxyalkyl nitrate (CF3)(2)CHOC(O)ONO2 which can reduce the visibility of the atmosphere is produced as the primary subsequent oxidation product of (CF3)(2)CHOCHO in a NO-rich environment. The main species detected experimentally are confirmed by this study. The computational results are crucial to risk assessment and pollution prevention of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs).

AB We present a comprehensive analysis of the seasonal variability of the vertical profiles of the optical and geometrical properties of Saharan dust aerosols, observed in the height region between 1000 and 6000 m, over the city of Athens, Greece, from February 2000 to December 2016. These observations were performed by a multiwavelength (355-387-532-1064 nm) Raman lidar system under cloud-free conditions. The statistical analysis (using aerosol monthly mean values) is based on nighttime vertical Raman measurements of range-resolved aerosol optical properties (backscatter and extinction coefficients, lidar ratio, Angstrom exponent) at 355 nm (57 dust events during more than 80 measurement hours). We found that the number of dust events was highest in spring, summer, and early autumn periods and that during spring the dust layers were moved at higher altitudes (similar to 4500 m) than in other seasons. The number of the forecasted dusty days (on monthly basis) by the BSCDREAM8b model compared to those of the performed lidar measurements were found to have a quite strong correlation (R-2 = 0.81), with a maximum occurrence predicted for the spring season. In the worst case scenario, at least 50% of the model-forecasted dust events can be observed by lidar under cloudless skies over Athens. For the sampled dust plumes we found mean lidar ratios of 52 +/- 13 sr at 355 nm in the height range 2000-4000 m a.s.l. Moreover, the dust layers had a mean thickness of 2497 +/- 1026 m and a center of mass of 2699 +/- 1017 m.
   An analysis performed regarding the air mass back-trajectories arriving over Athens revealed two main clusters: one pathway from south-west to north-east, with dust emission areas in Tunisia, Algeria and Libya and a second one from south, across the Mediterranean Sea with emission areas over Libya and the remaining part of Algeria and Tunisia. This clustering enabled us to differentiate between the aerosol optical properties between the two clusters, based on their residence time over the Saharan region, the European continent and the Mediterranean Sea. We finally concluded that even if the dust source regions are about the same, the aging and mixing processes of these air masses, passing over different areas, might have an impact on the aerosol optical properties.

AB This paper examines the impact of variability in impact of air pollution on life satisfaction (LS). Previous studies have shown robust negative impact of air pollution on subjective well-being (SWB). However, empirical studies that consider variability in air pollution effects through comparative city study are limited. This study provides comparative evaluation of two major Chinese cities: Beijing and Shanghai. We apply a geo-statistical spatial interpolation technique on pollution data from monitoring sites to estimate the Sulfur Dioxide (SO2), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), coarse particles with a diameter between 2.5 and 10 mu(10)) and fine particles with a diameter of 2.5 pm or less (PM2.5) pollution exposure of respondents of a survey conducted in 2016. The results show that all pollutants have robust negative impacts on LS for Beijing residents, whereas only SO2 and NO2 have significant negative impacts on LS for Shanghai residents; Per unit impact of SO2 is greater in Shanghai, and that of NO2 is greater in Beijing. Beijing and Shanghai residents have almost same monetary valuation for SO2 reduction but Beijing residents place approximately 1.5 times valuation on NO2 reduction compared to Shanghai residents. Moreover, the LS of Beijing residents is sensitive to temporal changes in the pollution level, whereas Shanghai residents are unaffected by such changes.

AB A yearlong air monitoring campaign was conducted to assess the impact of local temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed on the temporal and spatial variability of PM2.5 in El Paso, Texas. Monitoring was conducted at four sites purposely selected to capture the local traffic variability. Effects of meteorological events on seasonal PM2.5 variability were identified. For instance, in winter low-wind and low-temperature conditions were associated with high PM2.5 events that contributed to elevated seasonal PM2.5 levels. Similarly, in spring, high PM2.5 events were associated with high-wind and low-relative humidity conditions. Correlation coefficients between meteorological variables and PM2.5 fluctuated drastically across seasons. Specifically, it was observed that for most sites correlations between PM2.5 and meteorological variables either changed from positive to negative or dissolved depending on the season. Overall, the results suggest that mixed effects analysis with season and site as fixed factors and meteorological variables as covariates could increase the explanatory value of LUR models for PM2.5.

AB This paper presents an 8-year (2005-2012 inclusive) study of the marine aerosol distribution and variability over the Southern Indian Ocean, precisely in the area {10 degrees S- 40 degrees S; 50 degrees E- 110 degrees E} which has been identified as one of the most pristine regions of the globe. A large dataset consisting of satellite data (POLDER, CALIOP), AERONET measurements at Saint-Denis (French Reunion Island) and model reanalysis (MACC), has been used. In spite of a positive bias of about 0.05 between the AOD (aerosol optical depth) given by POLDER and MACC on one hand and the AOD measured by AERONET on the other, consistent results for aerosol distribution and variability over the area considered have been obtained. First, aerosols are mainly confined below 2 Ion asl (above sea level) and are dominated by sea salt, especially in the center of the area of interest, with AOD <= 0. 1. This zone is the most pristine and is associated with the position of the Mascarene anticyclone. There, the direct radiative effect is assessed around -9 W m(-2) at the top of the atmosphere and probability density functions of the AODs are leptokurtic lognormal functions without any significant seasonal variation. It is also suggested that the Madden-Jullian oscillation impacts sea salt emissions in the northern part of the area considered by modifying the state of the ocean surface. Finally, this area is surrounded in the northeast and the southwest by seasonal Australian and South African intrusions (AOD > 0.1); throughout the year, the ITCZ seems to limit continental contaminations from Asia. Due to the long period of time considered (almost a decade), this paper completes and strengthens results of studies based on observations performed during previous specific field campaigns.

AB Daytime cycles of aerosol optical depth (AOD) and Angstrom exponent (AE) climatology were analyzed based on long-term (5-15 years) measurements at 18 stations of the China Aerosol Remote Sensing Network (CARSNET) in North China. AOD in Northwest China (NWC) exhibits a daytime trend with negative departures in the early morning and later afternoon while positive departures at midday. Daytime AOD relative departure in different sites and seasons varies from - 30.26% to 30.28%. AE in NWC shows an opposite pattern to daytime variation of AOD. Daytime variation of AE is negligible in North China Plain (NCP), AOD increases steadily throughout the day. This trend is consistent and repeatable in four seasons. Such pronounced variability in AOD and AE should be taken accounted for in the estimation of diurnal aerosol direct radiative effects (ADRE), as suggested by the radiative transfer model simulations. The replacement of the observed daytime variation of AOD and AE by daytime mean values in NWC results in ADRE differences of 0.31 Wm(-2) at the surface and 0.05 Wm(-2) at the top of the atmosphere (TOA). ADRE in NWC will be underestimated by -0.47 Wm(-2) and -0.25 Wm(-2) at the surface and TOA, respectively, if instantaneous AOD and AE during the overpass time of Terra and Aqua are taken as the daytime mean values. The annual mean ADRE at the surface and TOA will be underestimated by -0.17 Wm(-2) and -0.03 Wm(-2) if daytime variations of AOD and AE are replaced by daytime mean values in NCP. ADRE will be underestimated by -0.07 Wm(-2) at the surface and -0.06 Wm(-2) at the TOA if instantaneous AOD and AE during the overpass time of Terra and Aqua other than daytime variation of AOD and AE are used in the calculations.

AB A suite of aircraft measurements was conducted over the Gulf of Tonkin, located downwind to the east of Mainland Southeast Asia (MSE), between March 23rd and April 6th, 2015. To the best of our knowledge, this campaign of 11 flights (totaling 34.4 h) was the first in-flight measurement over the region. Measurements of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, ozone, carbon monoxide, black carbon and the particulate scattering coefficient were recorded at approximately 1 500 m (low level) and 3 000 m (high level). Significantly higher measurements of black carbon, carbon monoxide and ozone in the high level on March 23rd and April 5th and 6th were directly related to biomass burning in the MSE and were comparable to severe pollution events at the surface. Similarly, relatively low pollutant concentrations were observed at both altitudes between March 23rd and April 5th. A combined analysis of the measurements with meteorology and satellite data verified that the plumes captured at 3 000 m were attributed to transport in the high altitude originating from biomass burning in northern MSE. Furthermore, each plume captured by the measurements in the high level corresponded to heavy regional air pollution caused by biomass burning in northern MSE. In addition, relatively low levels of the measured pollutants corresponded to relatively light pollution levels in MSE and its adjacent areas. Taken together, these results indicated that aircraft measurements were accurate in characterizing the variation in transport and pollutant levels. During the most active season of biomass burning in MSE, pollutant emissions and their regional impact could vary on an episodic basis. Nonetheless, such concentrated emissions from biomass burning is likely to lead to particularly high atmospheric-loading of pollutants at a regional level and, depending on weather conditions, has the potential of being transported over considerably longer distances. Further investigation of the short-term impacts of such concentrations therefore appears prudent.

AB Inhalation of respirable crystalline silica (RCS) can cause diseases including silicosis and cancer. Levels of RCS close to an emission source are measured but little is known about the wider ambient exposure from industry emissions or natural sources. The aim of this work is to report the RCS concentrations obtained from a variety of ambient environments using a new mobile respirable (PM4) sampler. A mobile battery powered high flow rate (52 L min(-1)) sampler was developed and evaluated for particulate aerosol sampling employing foams to select the respirable particle size fraction. Sampling was conducted in the United Kingdom at site boundaries surrounding seven urban construction and demolition and five sand quarry sites. These are compared with data from twelve urban aerosol samples and from repeat measurements from a base line study at a single rural site. The 50% particle size penetration (d(50)) through the foam was 4.3 mu m. Over 85% of predict bias values were with +/- 10% of the respirable convention, which is based on a log normal curve. Results for RCS from all construction and quarry activities are generally low with a 95 th percentile of 11 mu g m(-3). Eighty percent of results were less than the health benchmark value of 3 mu g m(-3) used in some states in America for ambient concentrations. The power cutting of brick and the largest demolition activities gave the highest construction levels. Measured urban background RCS levels were typically below 0.3 mu g m(-3) and the median RCS level, at a rural background location, was 0.02 mu g m(-3). These reported ambient RCS concentrations may provide useful baseline values to assess the wider impact of fugitive, RCS containing, dust emissions into the wider environment.

AB Vehicle emissions are a major contributor to air pollution in cities and have serious health impacts to their inhabitants. On-road remote sensing is an effective and economic tool to monitor and control vehicle emissions. In this review, the mechanism, accuracy, advantages and limitations of remote sensing were introduced. Then the applications and major findings of remote sensing were critically reviewed. It was revealed that the emission distribution of on-road vehicles was highly skewed so that the dirtiest 10% vehicles accounted for over half of the total fleet emissions. Such findings highlighted the importance and effectiveness of using remote sensing for in situ identification of high-emitting vehicles for further inspection and maintenance programs. However, the accuracy and number of vehicles affected by screening programs were greatly dependent on the screening criteria. Remote sensing studies showed that the emissions of gasoline and diesel vehicles were significantly reduced in recent years, with the exception of NO emissions of diesel vehicles in spite of greatly tightened automotive emission regulations. Thirdly, the experience and issues of using remote sensing for identifying high emitting vehicles in Hong Kong (where remote sensing is a legislative instrument for enforcement purposes) were reported. That was followed by the first time ever identification and discussion of the issue of frequent false detection of diesel high-emitters using remote sensing. Finally, the challenges and future research directions of on-road remote sensing were elaborated.

AB Communities in the Navajo Nation face public health burdens caused in part by the combustion of wood and coal for indoor heating using stoves that are old or in disrepair. Wood and coal combustion emits particulate matter (PM) with aerodynamic diameter < 2.5 mu m (PM2.5), which can reach deep in the lung and cause injuries. Currently, there is little information about the health effects of wood and coal combustion-derived PM2.5 on Navajo Nation residents. This study tested the hypothesis that PM2.5 generated from solid fuel combustion in stoves commonly used by Navajo residents would induce stratified oxidative stress responses ranging from activation of antioxidant defense to inflammation and cell death in mouse macrophages (RAW 264.7). PM2.5 emitted from burning Ponderosa Pine (PP) and Utah Juniper (UJ) wood and Black Mesa (BM) and Fruitland (FR) coal in a stove representative of those widely used by Navajo residents were collected, and their aqueous suspensions used for cellular exposure. PM from combustion of wood had significantly more elemental carbon (EC) (15%) and soluble Ni (0.0029%) than the samples from coal combustion (EC: 3%; Ni: 0.0019%) and was also a stronger activator of antioxidant enzyme heme oxygenase-1 (11-fold increase vs. control) than that from coal (5 fold increase). Only PM from PP-wood (12-fold) and BM-coal (3-fold) increased the release of inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha. Among all samples, PP-wood consistently had the strongest oxidative stress and inflammatory effects. PM components, i.e. low-volatility organic carbon, EC, Cu, Ni and K were positively correlated with the cellular responses. Results showed that, at the concentrations tested, emissions from all fuels did not have significant cytotoxicity. These findings suggest that PM2.5 emitted from combustion of wood and coal commonly used by Navajo residents may negatively impact the health of this community.

AB Equivalent black carbon (BBC) mass concentrations in the fine inhalable fraction of airborne particles (PM2.5) were determined using a 7-wavelength Aethalometer for 17 months, between November 2014 and March 2016, for a suburban location of the Metropolitan Area of Buenos Aires (MABA), Argentina. In addition to describing seasonal and diurnal black carbon (BC) cycles for the first time in this region, the relative contributions of fossil fuel and remote and local biomass burning were determined by distinguishing different carbonaceous components based on their effect on light attenuation for different wavelengths. Trajectory analyses and satellite-based fire products were used to illustrate the impact of long-range transport of particles emitted by non-local sources. EBC data showed a marked diurnal cycle, largely modulated by traffic variations and the height of the boundary layer, and a seasonal cycle with monthly median EBC concentrations (in mu g/m(3)) ranging from 1.5 (February) to 3.4 (June). Maximum values were found during winter due to the combination of prevailingly stable atmospheric conditions and the increase of fossil fuel emissions, derived primarily from traffic and biomass burning from the domestic use of wood for heating. The use of charcoal grills was also detected and concentrated during weekends. The average contribution of fossil fuel combustion sources to BBC concentrations was 96%, with the remaining 4% corresponding to local and regional biomass burning. During the entire study period, only two events were identified during which EBC concentrations attributed to regional biomass burning accounted for over 50% of total BBC; these events demonstrate the relevance of agricultural and forestry activities that take place far from the city yet whose emissions can affect the urban atmosphere of the MABA.

AB Irradiance and LiDAR measurements at the surface combined with satellite products from SEVIRI (Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager) and MODIS (MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) were used to detect and characterize the Etna volcano (Italy) plume that crossed southeastern Italy on 3 December 2015, from about 10:00 up to 11:30 UTC, and estimate its radiative impact. The volcanic plume was delivered by a violent and short paroxysmal eruption that occurred from 02:30 to 03:10 UTC of 3 December 2015, about 400 km away from the monitoring site. Measurements from the LiDAR combined with model results showed that the aerosol optical depth of the volcanic plume, located from about 11 to 13 km above sea level (asl), was equal to 0.80 +/- 0.07 at 532 nm. A low tropospheric aerosol load, located up to about 7 km asl, with optical depth equal to 0.19 +/- 0.01 at 532 nm was also revealed by the LiDAR measurements. Short-Wave (SW) downward and upward irradiance measurements revealed that the instantaneous SW direct radiative forcing at the surface (DRFsurf) decreased to -146 +/- 16 Wm(-2) at 10:50 UTC because of the volcanic plume passage. A Two-Stream radiative transfer model integrated with experimental measurements, which took into account the volcanic plume and the low tropospheric aerosol properties, was used to reproduce the SW radiative flux measurements at the surface and estimate the aerosol DRF both at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) and at the surface, in addition to the aerosol heating rate vertical profile. We found that the clear-sky, instantaneous, SW DRF at the TOA and the atmospheric forcing were equal to -112 and 33 W m(-2), respectively, at 10:50 UTC that represented the time at which the volcanic plume radiative impact was the highest. The SW aerosol heating rate reached the peak value of 1.24 K day(-1) at 12 km asl and decreased to - 0.06 K day(-1) at 11 km asl, at 10:50 UTC. The role of the aerosol load located up to about 7 km asl and the corresponding radiative impact has also been evaluated.
