AB Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating on potassium feldspar has been performed with high resolution in the Luochuan section in the Chinese Loess Plateau. An age hiatus of similar to 15 ka is found at the top of L2 layer within the loess/paleosol sequences. The age of the potassium feldspar from the calcrete nodules along the S1/L2 boundary is significantly older than those of the paleosol and loess samples lying above and below the boundary. The age overestimation of the potassium feldspar from calcrete nodules is caused by the underestimation of the dose rate, because accretion of carbonates could dilute the radioactivity. The age hiatus at the top of L2 also resulted from the underestimation of the dose rates of four loess samples beneath this hiatus. These four loess samples have high CaO concentrations. Ages of these samples are overestimated in the similar way as the nodules, but with smaller degrees. All results suggest that the accretion of carbonates happened after the loess deposition.
   The carbonate accretion process of the calcrete nodules has been simulated with accumulation models. The accretion can be as young as 46 ka, assuming the calcrete nodules formed rapidly at a certain time point. For slow and gradual accretion models, the carbonate started to accumulate slowly since the dust deposition and the accumulation became faster afterwards. The transition of the accretion rate may relate to the climate change or a change in the carbonate leaching and re-precipitation system.

AB Understanding the chronology of eolian sand-loess-paleosol sequences along the northern margin of the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) is crucial for comprehending climate change and the advance and retreat of the adjacent Mu Us desert. In this study, a sand-loess-soil sequence from the northern margin of the CLP was studied by applying the single aliquot regenerative (SAR) protocol to quartz grains, and the multi-elevated-temperature post-IR IRSL (MET-pIRIR) protocol to K-feldspar grains. For equivalent dose (D-c) determination, 63-90 mu m quartz and K-feldspar grains were used. Our results indicate that the MET-pIRIR ages of K-feldspar grains in this sequence range from 94.4 +/- 7.0 ka to 148.3 +/- 13.3 ka for the last interglacial paleosol (S1); for the upper part of the section, quartz-based SAR-OSL dating was used, yielding ages spanning from 5.8 +/- 0.4 ka to 35.9 +/- 4.1 ka. After cross-checking these results with previously-reported isochron OSL and TL ages, the reliability of the METpIRIR protocol when applied to the last interglacial paleosol was confirmed. Based on a new OSL chronology of the Shimao profile, the studied eolian deposits can be broadly correlated with the last glacial-interglacial cycle, but their dating also points to sedimentary hiatuses occurring at 94.4 ka, 35.9 ka and 5.8 ka, due most probably to strong wind erosion caused by intensified cold-dry winter monsoonal circulations during the last glacial maxima.

AB Loess deposits are important archives of past climate change in subtropical China, where long-term terrestrial records are scarce. However, only a few long-term records with reliable dating were reported in Jiangsu Province, where loess deposits in southeastern China were first discovered and designated as the Xiashu Loess. Moreover, the provenance of the Xiashu Loess is still controversial. This study presents the magnetostratigraphy and detrital zircon U-Pb age results of loess deposits at Zhoujiashan in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province. To date, this section (with basal age of approximately 0.88 Ma) may be the oldest loess deposits discovered in southeastern China. Based on the detrital zircon U-Pb ages of the Zhoujiashan section, together with published results of geochemistry, geomorphology, sedimentology, and meteorology, we propose that the Xiashu Loess has two mixed sources. Local materials derived from the Yangtze River Basin (including exposed river/lake beds, floodplains, and mountains) served as a major contributor. The distal eolian dust that originated from the arid areas of North China (including deserts, piedmont alluvial fans, and drylands) played a minor role in the formation process of the Xiashu Loess. The nearly synchronous onset age (approximately 0.88-0.85 Ma) of the Xiashu Loess was attributed to a regional environmental event during the middle Pleistocene transition.

AB In this work, the Moving Particle Semi-implicit (MPS) method is enhanced for multi-resolution problems with different resolutions at different parts of the domain utilising a particle splitting algorithm for the finer resolution and a particle merging algorithm for the coarser resolution. The Least Square MPS (LSMPS) method is used for higher stability and accuracy. Novel boundary conditions are developed for the treatment of wall and pressure boundaries for the Multi-Resolution LSMPS method. A wall is represented by polygons for effective simulations of fluid flows with complex wall geometries and the pressure boundary condition allows arbitrary inflow and outflow, making the method easier to be used in flow simulations of channel flows. By conducting simulations of channel flows and free surface flows, the accuracy of the proposed method was verified. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The vibration behavior of thin elastic structures can be noticeably influenced by the surrounding water, which represents a kind of heavy fluid. Since the feedback of the acoustic pressure onto the structure cannot be neglected in this case, a strong coupled scheme between the structural and fluid domains is usually required. In this work, a coupled finite element and boundary element (FE-BE) solver is developed for the free vibration analysis of structures submerged in an infinite fluid domain or a semi-infinite fluid domain with a free water surface. The structure is modeled by the finite element method (FEM). The compressibility of the fluid is taken into account, and hence the Helmholtz equation serves as the governing equation of the fluid domain. The boundary element method (BEM) is employed to model the fluid domain, and a boundary integral formulation with a half-space fundamental solution is used to satisfy the Dirichlet boundary condition on the free water surface exactly. The resulting nonlinear eigenvalue problem (NEVP) is converted into a small linear one by using a contour integral method. Adequate modifications are suggested to improve the efficiency of the contour integral method and avoid missing the eigenfrequencies of interest. The Burton-Miller method is used to filter out the fictitious eigenfrequencies of the boundary integral formulations. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the accuracy and applicability of the developed eigensolver, and also show that the fluid-loading effect strongly depends on both the water depth and the mode shapes.

AB We present a weak-coupling approach for fluid-structure interaction with low density ratio (rho) of solid to fluid. For accurate and stable solutions, we introduce predictors, an explicit two-step method and the implicit Euler method, to obtain provisional velocity and position of fluid-structure interface at each time step, respectively. The incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, together with these provisional velocity and position at the fluidstructure interface, are solved in an Eulerian coordinate using an immersed-boundary finite-volume method on a staggered mesh. The dynamic equation of an elastic solid-body motion, together with the hydrodynamic force at the provisional position of the interface, is solved in a Lagrangian coordinate using a finite element method. Each governing equation for fluid and structure is implicitly solved using second-order time integrators. The overall second-order temporal accuracy is preserved even with the use of lower-order predictors. A linear stability analysis is also conducted for an ideal case to find the optimal explicit two-step method that provides stable solutions down to the lowest density ratio. With the present weak coupling, three different fluid-structure interaction problems were simulated: flows around an elastically mounted rigid circular cylinder, an elastic beam attached to the base of a stationary circular cylinder, and a flexible plate, respectively. The lowest density ratios providing stable solutions are searched for the first two problems and they are much lower than 1 (rho(min)= 0.21and 0.31, respectively). The simulation results agree well with those from strong coupling suggested here and also from previous numerical and experimental studies, indicating the efficiency and accuracy of the present weak coupling.

AB We investigated the effects of sintering temperature and time on the dielectric and mechanical properties, sintering, microstructure, crystallization, and thermal expansion coefficient of Magnesium aluminum silicate glass-ceramic for the applications of low temperature co-fired ceramics substrates. The glass-ceramic has been prepared by melt quenching route. The crystallization kinetics of glass-ceramic was investigated using non-isothermal methods by differential thermal analysis. The activation energy for crystallization E was found to be 201.92 kJ/mol. Mg0.6Al1.2Si1.8O6 was the first crystalline phase forming in the glass-ceramic. With the increase of sintering temperature, the phases of ZrO2 and indialite precipitate successively. The coefficient of thermal expansion of glass-ceramic increased with the increase of the sintering temperature and time. With the increase of sintering temperature or holding time, the density, bending strength and dielectric constant of the material all increased first and then decreased. The samples sintered at 900 degrees C for 2 h showed the best properties: high bulk density (2.695 g/cm(3) ), low dielectric constant (6.21) and low dielectric loss (1.2 * 10(-3)), good bending strength (163 MPa) and low coefficient of thermal expansion (6.35 * 10(-6) K--(1)). The results showed that the prepared glass-ceramic can be considered as a potential candidate for the application of low temperature co-fired ceramic substrates.

The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) technique at various heating rates under the non-isochronal conditions was used to identify the characteristic temperatures like the glass transition (T-g), the softening (T-s), the crystallization (T-c), the liquidus (T-L ), and the melting (T-m) of the system. The glass stability and glass forming ability (GFA) parameters were determined based on these characteristic temperatures. The activation energies of both the glass transition (E-g) and crystallization (Ec) have been computed by different methods. The Avrami kinetic constant (n) has been determined by more than a method to identify the crystallization succession.

AB Despite great advances in glass science and technology, the debate on the predominant feature of the glass structural model, especially the structure-property relationship, has lasted for more than half a century. Recently, the phase diagram approach has shown to be an effective method for investigating the physical properties of glass but it is restricted to the binary glass systems. Herein, the phase diagram approach was popularized to a series of ternary glass systems with a quantitative prediction of their structure and physical properties, including the density, refractive index, thermal expansion coefficient, elastic modulus and shear modulus. Furthermore, the structure-property relationship of ternary glass and the borate anomaly are reasonably described via the phase diagram approach. Detailed error analysis for the predicted results is also performed. The good agreement between the calculated results and experimental data indicates that the phase diagram approach is a promising method for investigating the structure and physical properties of glasses, providing a novel insight into the study of glass science and technology.

AB Novel TiO2/g-C3N4 hollow nanotube heterojunction was prepared via a molten salts method. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) result showed the crystalline phase of g-C3N4 hollow nanotube was changed from triazine-based g-C3N4 phase transition to heptazine-based g-C3N4 phase with the addition of TiO2 nanoparticles. The square hollow morphology, about 400 nm width and 60-70 nm wall thickness were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) implied that the heterojunction can capture more visible light. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra showed that the heterojunction had efficient separation of photo generated electrons and holes. The heterojunction showed a rapid RhB degradation with the degradation rate of 95% in 60 min. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A novel filter paper (FP) with superhydrophobicity and superoleophilicity was prepared via adsorption and immersion process for the separation of surfactant-stabilized water-in-oil emulsions. The realization of superhydrophobicity with a water contact angle of 153 degrees benefits from the Cu(OH)(2) nanostructure formed on FP and subsequent stearic acid (STA) modification. The three-dimensional network of FP as well as superhydrophobic and superoleophilic property can facilitate the demulsification of emulsified oil, thus the only gravity-driven separations of various water-in-oil emulsions with high oil flux and good recyclability have been achieved. The superhydrophobic FP can be massively applied in emulsion separation due to its facile preparation and superior performance. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In4Se3 exhibits high thermoelectric performance as a typical example of semiconductors, which is a promising thermoelectric candidate for energy conversion applications. Here, InSe alloy core thermoelectric fibers with glass cladding were fabricated by a reactive molten core drawing method. The as-drawn fiber core was found to be InSe crystals as evidenced by X-ray diffraction. The In4Se3 crystals were obtained in the fiber core by annealing the as-drawn fibers. The Seebeck coefficient of the In4Se3 core fibers (-347 mu V/K) was enhanced by similar to 85% compared with that of the as-drawn InSe core fibers (-189 mu V/K). This work constitutes a proof-of-concept that thermoelectric materials can be incorporated into fibers, which have promising applications in fiber-based thermoelectric devices. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this paper, the physio-chemical characteristics of green synthesised PLA/silver nanoparticles (PLA-AgNPs) system was investigated for H2O2 sensing. The precursor, silver nitrate (AgNO3) was reduced to nanosilver (n-Ag) by Piper nigrum leaves extract in dual phase medium containing PLA (Capping agent). X-ray photo electron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was carried out to evaluate the interaction of PLA with silver nanoparticles. The morphological analysis by Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) obtained images of spherical silver particles with average size of about 10-20 nm. The H2O2 sensing was confirmed from the colour fading of the solution and vanishing of the characteristic surface plasmon resonance (SPR) absorbance peak of PLA-AgNPs on adding H2O2. The proposed sensor can detect even very low concentrations (5 mu M) of hydrogen peroxide and finds applicability in biological and environmental analysis. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, Te-doped multifilled n-type skutterudite compounds were prepared by high pressure and high temperature (HPHT) method and characterized by X-ray and SEM, which showed that InxBa0.2-xCo4Sb11.5Te0.5 samples with fine grain size can be prepared by HPHT rapidly. Both thermal transport properties and electrical transport properties have been characterized in the temperature range of 363-765 K. The combination of (In, Ba) double-filled and Te-doped is more effective than simple Te-doped or the combination of In-filled and Te-doped in reducing lattice thermal conductivity. Finally, the figure of merit value (ZT) of In0.15Ba0.05Co4Sb11.5Te0.5 reached 1.11 at 765 K. This showed that the ZT values of samples can likely be improved through combining multiple filling atoms and doping atoms to broaden the range of resonant phonon scattering. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The sintering temperature of the LBBS glass doped LMNT ceramics can be effectively lowered to 900 degrees C. The experimental results revealed that the addition of the LBBS glass can assist to improve the Q x f values while shifting the tau(f) values toward negative direction. Particularly, the 1 wt% of LBBS glass doped LMNT ceramic sintered at 900 degrees C for 4 h possessed excellent microwave dielectric properties: epsilon(r) = 16, Q x f = 42,648 GHz, tau(f) = -1ppm/degrees C, which is potential for LTCC applications.

AB Silver nanowires (AgNWs) were decorated with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) using a facile spraying/dipcoating method so that the AgNW@AuNP film was fabricated as a promising alternative to conventional ITO film. The AgNW@AuNP film shows a network structure with AuNPs (<10 nm) decoration on the surface of AgNWs. This novel film exhibits excellent thermal stability (similar to 350 degrees C) due to the suppressed atom migration on silver surface, and a low sheet resistance of 8.1 Omega/square with just an absorbance incensement less than 6% compared to bare AgNW film. The films have potential applications as transparent conductive materials for optoelectronic and photoelectrochemical devices in harsh environment. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, the FeMnTiOx catalysts were modified firstly by tourmaline nanopowders via one-step solgel method, aiming at improving the catalytic efficiency. The effects of tourmaline nanopowders on the growth, micro morphology and surface elements valence distribution of the catalysts were systematically analyzed, which showed the tourmaline nanopowders had obvious influence on the growth mechanism of FeMnTiOx. The nano size solid solution catalyst was formed and loaded a 28.52 nm thickness shell on the surface of tourmaline nanopowders, and the contents of surface chemical oxygen, Mn3+ and Mn4+ were enhanced obviously due to the unique structure formed by tourmaline nanopowders. Accordingly, both the operation temperature window and catalytic efficiency of the modified FeMnTiOx catalysts as prepared were improved significantly, which was demonstrated to be an economical and efficient method in the field of low temperature SCR technology.

AB In this study, we studied the exchange bias (EB) effect in Ni50Mn35In15 and Ni50Mn35In15/BiFeO3 heterostructure thin films deposited onto Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si substrate using dc/rf magnetron sputtering. In pure Ni50Mn35In15 film, the shift of the hysteresis loop from the origin up to 110 Oe was observed at 10 K due to coexistence of FM-AFM interface. On the other hand, the shift of the hysteresis loop was significantly enhanced (480 Oe) in Ni50Mn35In15/BiFeO3 heterostructure thin film at 10 K in field cooled. Further, a high exchange bias field of 80 Oe was found at room temperature in Ni50Mn35In15/BiFeO3 heterostructure thin film. The observed exchange bias field (H-E) in this heterostructure thin film was attributed to the presence of a pinned and uncompensated spins in the antiferromagnetic at the interface, and induced by the interface exchange coupling between Ni50Mn35In15 and BiFeO3. This behaviour is an additional property for the Ni50Mn35In15/BiFeO3 heterostructure thin film to be used in various other magnetic memory devise applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

ID CUS; NANOSTRUCTURES
AB Copper sulfide (CuS) nanostructures have an important application prospect in the field of solar photothermal conversion because of their excellent photo-thermal stability. In this paper, nanostructured CuS nanorods were successfully prepared via hydrothermal reaction method. The crystal structure and surface morphology of the as-prepared CuS nanorods were characterized. The optical absorption and photo-thermal conversion performance of the CuS emulsions based on water were studied. The ultraviolet/visible/near infrared (UV/Vis/NIR) absorption spectra tests show that the prepared CuS emulsions have strong optical absorption in both visible light and near infrared light bands. And the photothermal conversion results indicate that the CuS emulsions possess good photo-thermal conversion performance, and the maximum temperature of the emulsion reaches about 74.44 degrees C with the mass fraction of 0.10%. Moreover, in a certain concentration range, the photo-thermal conversion performance will be effectively enhanced with increasing the mass fractions of the emulsions. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Obstacles to the commercialization of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in alternative energy and clean water applications include high production costs, aggregation problems, and poor water solubility. We report the use of Laponite nanoparticles to improve the aqueous phase fabrication of single-walled CNT (SWCNT) percolating networks. SWCNT/Laponite films were cast at varied Laponite and CNT ink concentrations to optimize polydispersity. Structural and morphological characterization identified isolated aggregates, coalesced aggregates, and interconnected networks. Conductive atomic force microscopy studies confirmed that the nanocomposite films maintained their electrical transport properties after heteromixing. Incorporating Laponite improved CNT aqueous dispersibility, prevented aggregation, and promoted continuous, homogenous film formation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB TiO2 composites are ideal pollution control materials. In this paper, Fe2O3/TiO2 film electrodes were prepared by the sol-gel and forced hydrolysis method. The apparent properties and electrochemical properties of the prepared electrodes were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), chronocoulometry and linear sweep voltammetry, and their photoelectrocatalytic properties were investigated under visible light by degradation experiments of Rhodamine B (RhB). The results showed that the particles prepared from 0.1 M Fe(NO3)(3) precursor were completely and uniformly distributed on the film surface. During the degradation experiments, the visible-light response current was 23.4 mu A, and the decolorized rate for RhB could be up to 92.3%. The semiconductor heterojunction structure comprised of Fe2O3 and TiO2 could effectively separate photo-generated electron hole pairs, inhibit their recombination, accelerate interfacial charge transfer, and enhance photocatalytic properties.

In order to enhance performance electrochemical energy storages, we have developed core (active material)/shell (conductive material) type CuO/graphene QDs as electrode materials using the combined electrolytes (KOH + LiCl). As a result, the performance of electrochemical energy storages exhibits specific capacitance of 154 F g(-1) at current density of 1 A g(-1) and cycling stability with 84% capacitance retention after 3,000 cycles.

AB As a novel process, the plasma spray-physical vapor deposition technology was used to in-situ synthesize the TiN coatings on the Ti-6Al-4V alloy. Due to its high power input and very low pressure, relatively pure TiN coatings with hybrid structures were successfully obtained at different spraying distances, which was not previously achieved with other thermal spraying processes. The results showed that the nitriding reaction occurred not only in the plasma jet but also on the substrate. Moreover, the spraying distance was found to affect the phase, microstructure, and mechanical property of the TiN coating. As a result, the mechanical properties of the Ti-6Al-4V alloy can be significantly enhanced by the TiN coatings. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A novel metal-free photocatalyst of g-C3N4/graphene oxide nanocomposite (CNNP/GO) was fabricated by loading g-C3N4 nanoparticles on graphene oxide through electrostatic self-assembly strategy. XRD, FT-IR, SEM, TEM, and PL were adopted to analyze the structure and properties of the CNNP/GO nanocomposite. Photocatalytic activity of CNNP/GO nanocomposite was evaluated by the degradation of methylene blue (MB) under visible-light irradiation. The results show that the nanonization of bulk g-C3N4 widens the band gap of g-C3N4 from 2.75 eV to 3.40 eV, and the obtained CNNP exhibits an obvious blue-shift in the absorption band edge compared with bulk g-C3N4, resulting in the weak response to visible light. Introducing GO into CNNP can efficiently reduce the band gap to 2.55 eV, thereby enhancing the utilization of visible light. Moreover, the GO can be served as an electron acceptor in the CNNP/GO nanocomposite, leading to significantly improvement in separation efficiency of photo-generated carriers. Hence, the best photocatalytic degradation rate of MB over CNNP/GO nanocomposite is about 2 and 6 times higher than that over bulk g-C3N4 and CNNP samples, respectively. Furthermore, this work also indicates that the novel CNNP could be an excellent material to combine with other semiconductors to construct high efficient nanocomposite photocatalyst.

AB Utilization of low heat cement is an effective way to decrease the cracking risk in mass concrete. This paper investigates hydration, mechanical property and calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) structure of early-strength low-heat Portland (ESLHP) cement-based materials. Due to the low content of C3S and slow hydration rate of ESLHP cement at early age, the hydration heat of ESLHP paste is lower compared with that of Portland cement (PC) paste. C-S-H in ESLHP cement paste has a higher degree of polymerization than that in PC one at late age. Besides, ESLHP cement has desirable early strength. The mechanical property of ESLHP mortar at late age is superior to that of PC mortar. The compressive strength of mortars is positively correlated with the mean silicate chain length in C-S-H.

The morphologies of Laves phase are discrepant under different laser power. The formation of Nb and Mo rich Laves phase is found in the as-deposited IN718 superalloy. The grains vary with increasing laser power from 850 W to 1100 W. Fine and relative uniform grains of IN718 superalloy are obtained under laser power 1000 W after solution treated at 1100 degrees C for 1 h. When the laser power is 1000 W, the obtained IN718 superalloy has the highest residual stress in the overlap area. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Titanium-diffused lithium tantalate (Ti: LT) multimode planar waveguide was produced by in-diffusion of titanium thin-film deposited onto a Z-cut congruent LT substrate. Titanium concentration (C-Ti) in the titanium-diffused layer was profiled by secondary-ion-mass-spectrometry. Modes guided in the waveguide were characterized by prism coupling technique. Refractive index in the waveguide is profiled on the basis of the measured mode indices, and is related to the C-Ti profile. The results show that both the refractive index and the C-Ti profiles obey to a Gaussian function. The profiles of titanium-induced extraordinary and ordinary index changes are almost identical, implying that the index change in the Ti: LT waveguide has a small anisotropy and the confinement to the mode field is polarization-insensitive. The ordinary and extraordinary index changes reveal a similar exponential dependence on the C-Ti with a power index of similar to 0.8. (C) 2018 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

The results indicated that filling the ET with 5 g of LECA particles with diameter of about 4 mm enhanced the energy absorption of the empty aluminum tube by 24%.

AB Present study reports the fabrication of Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) nanostructures on silicon (Si) substrates with the help of GaAs ions produced by hot and dense argon plasma in a modified dense plasma focus device. The fabricated nanostructures are further irradiated by Ar2+ ion beam having energy of 100 keV and fluences of 1 x 10(13) ions/cm(2), 5 x 10(14) ions/cm(2) and 5 x 10(15) ions/cm(2) in a ion beam accelerator. The morphological, stoichiometric and optical properties of as-fabricated and ion beam irradiated nanostructures have been compared to study the presence of defect states. As-deposited GaAs nanodots were found to be modified as nanostructured films upon ion irradiation. Excess arsenic present in as-deposited nanodots as deep level defect, is removed from ion irradiated nanostructured films. Thus, we found that the deep level defect states i.e., arsenic antisite (EL2) were annealed out in ion irradiated samples as is evident from Raman and photoluminescence spectra. It is found that ion irradiation reduces the EL2 defects in nanostructured films which have immense potential applications in enhancing efficiency of optoelectronic and electronic devices.

AB Novel N-doped CsTi2NbO7@g-C3N4 (NCT/CN) core-shell nanobelts were prepared by a facile one-step calcination method for the first time, in which [Ti2NbO7](-) layers were in situ doped by nitrogen atoms, and g-C3N4 was formed both on the external surface and within the interlayers of N-CsTi2NbO7. The morphology, structure and visible-light photocatalytic activity of samples were studied and discussed in detail. The resulted NCT/CN composite showed an enhanced visible-light photocatalytic activity in the degradation of RhB, attributing to the synergistic effects of N-doping, morphology engineering and heterojunction formation.

AB It's the first time to modify cadmium sulfide (CdS) nanostructures using copper (Cu), yielding Cu-CdS, for oxytetracycline (OTC) removal and highly efficient hydrogen formation at the same time with dual cell. Cu-CdS composites were synthesized through photodeposition method. The high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) results reveal that Cu is uniformly loaded on the surface of CdS. Corresponding results show that the best Cu loading content for hydrogen production of 24.88 mmol h(-1) g(-1) is 1%. In addition, 4% Cu-CdS shows the best OTC removal efficiency of 81.4%. Moreover, H-2 formation and OTC degradation is majorly induced by h(+) and center dot OH based on the results of scavenging experiment and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis.

The starting zeolites, in their H-form, were subjected to desilication and recrystallization in a single step in the presence of a NaOH solution at 100 degrees C for 20 h. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) results confirmed the formation of crystalline zeolite P. Specific surface areas from 20 to 70 m(2)/g were obtained with mesoporous volumes between 0.03 and 0.22 cm(3)/g. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) micrographs showed that the obtained materials had been formed by agglomerates of nanosized crystallites. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Garnet-type lithium ion conductor Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) has received great attention toward development of all solid-state lithium ion batteries due to its high lithium ion conductivity and relative stability against lithium metal at room temperature. Nowadays, more efforts about LLZO focus on studying the effect of crystal structure and ion doping on lithium ion conductivity. However, the morphology of LLZO also is somehow less studied. In this paper, LLZO fibers are successfully synthesized using naturally bio-mass Kapok fibers as template. The pellets pressed by LLZO fibers exhibit higher lithium ion-conductivity with the value 1.30 x 10(-4) S.cm(-1). Meanwhile LLZO ink obtained by dispersing LLZO fibers into isopropanol reveals Newtonian fluid property, and is potentially suitable for jet printing. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB SnO2 has been studied as a promising anode material for lithium-ion batteries due to its high theoretical capacity. However, the large volume change (>300%) and severe structural collapse during cycles are serious. To solve these issues, the porous SnO2 dumbbell-shaped hollow microspheres (DSHSs) were synthesized by a sacrificial template method. The porous SnO2 DSHSs deliver a capacity of 695 mAh g(-1) when the current density returns from 1600 to 100 mA g(-1). After being tested at larger current density of 1.0 A g(-1) for 100 cycles, the capacity retain 602 mAh g(-1). The superior performance of porous SnO2 DSHSs can be attributed to the porous and hollow microstructure, which provides more lithium storage sites; shorter Li-ion diffusion length and sufficient void space.

AB Er-doped AlN thin films were deposited by RF magnetron sputtering on (0001) sapphire substrates under different temperature. We systematically investigate the influence of substrate temperature on the crystalline structure and the piezoelectric properties of the films. Consequently, the XRD intensity of (0 0 2) oriented peak first increases and then decreases with increasing substrate temperature, reaching a maximum value and a highly c-axis columnar crystal structure at 200 degrees C. The piezoelectric constant d(33) indicates a maximum value of 9.41 pm/V at substrate temperature of 200 degrees C. Due to Er doping in AlN films, an improvement in their crystalline structures and piezoelectric properties is noticed. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Evidence for Jahn-Teller compression in the (Mg, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn)O
   entropy-stabilized oxide: A DFT study

ID COPPER(II) CENTERS; STATES; EPR; CAO
AB The local atomic configuration and the electronic structure of the octahedral Cu2+ centers in the entropy-stabilized oxides (ESOs), (MgCoNiZn)(1) xCuxO (x = 0.13, 0.2, 0,.26), have been investigated using density functional theory. The calculated Cu-O bond lengths combined with the analysis of the electronic density of states indicate that similar to 10% of the CuO6 octahedra in ESOs undergo Jahn-Teller (JT) compression. This unexpected behavior is likely related to the structural constraints imposed by the rocksalt lattice and reflects the competition between the regular octahedral environment preferred by the cations in the system and the JT distortion imposed by the Cu-centers. The orientation of the distortions appears to be random, in agreement with recent experimental results. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Different weight ratios of 316L austenitic stainless steel, Cr3C2 and Ti powders were mixed to synthesize TiC-reinforced Fe-based composites by laser melting deposition. Fine TiC-particles were in situ synthesized through the reaction of Ti with Cr3C2 and were found to be uniformly dispersed in the matrix. The alpha-Fe phase was precipitated out of the gamma-Fe matrix with the addition of Cr3C2 and Ti powders. The mechanism of TiC formation and phase evolution was analyzed based on thermodynamics calculations. The volume fraction and the size of the in situ synthesized TiC were found to affect grain texture of the gamma-Fe matrix. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Using photo-Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (photo-KPFM) we observed macroscopic, photo-induced polarization through 200 nm thick polycrystalline methylammonium lead triiodide (MAPbI(3)) perovskite films in MAPbI(3)/charge carrier transport material (CTM) bilayers. A polarization of up to similar to 600 mV was observed for some MAPbI(3)/CTM bilayers and the sign of polarization is dependent on the predominant charge carrier properties of the CTM used. We propose that through-film photo-KPFM polarization measurements can be useful in determining the efficacy of a CTM. Polarized perovskite films may also have applications as surfaces for performing electrochemical reactions. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A high performance polyaniline (PANI) nanowires electrode was prepared by electrodeposition of aniline on porous tubular carbon (PTC). The resulting composites PTC/PANI with a vine-like shape exhibited remarkable electrochemical performance, including a high specific capacitance (477.7 F g (1) at (1) A g (1)) and an excellent cycling stability (91% capability retention after 5000 cycles). Such excellent performance was attributed to the synergistic effects between PTC and PANI. PTC with well-defined macropores and interconnected meso-/micropores structure can facilitate the transfer of ions and electrons and can also effectively avoid PANI agglomeration; the nanostructured PANI can provide pseudocapacitance. Moreover, the good contact between PANI and PTC, which was constructed by electrodeposition, ensures a low contact resistance and reinforces structural stability of the composite electrode.

AB HA/45S5 composite films were deposited by a KrF excimer laser on Ti-6Al-4 V, and a post annealing was carried out. HA/45S5 composite film deposited at 200 degrees C is amorphous, and the post annealing can't promote the crystallization of 45S5 bioglass but can increase the crystallinity of HA greatly. The composition of the composite films and the annealing process play an important role on the formation of the oriented HA. Slight a-axis preferred orientation of HA structure was observed in the films treated at 700 degrees C for 2 h, and c-axis preferred orientation of HA structure was observed at 800 degrees C for 2 h or 4 h.

AB The novel composite materials that can efficiently harvest multifunction will be critical in smart applications. In this work, the inorganic-organic hybrid TiO2@PDA@CuO nanoparticles were prepared by a simple method and characterized by SEM, TEM, XRD, Raman, BET, XPS, UV-vis and TGA analyses. The as-prepared TiO2@PDA@CuO particles exhibit oval or polygon shape (similar to 30 nm). Effects of modifiers' kinds, concentration, supports and modification time on wettable property of TiO2@PDA@CuO were investigated initially. Next we demonstrated that the photocatalytic ability had an accelerated process after PDA loading on TiO2 support. The gas sensing ability is another important application and this research covers its optimal operating temperature (260 degrees C), response time, recovery time and long-time stability.

AB Ichthyophthirius multifiliis is a ciliated parasite that infests almost all freshwater fish species and causes great economic losses to the aquaculture industry. In this study, a compound with anti-I. multifiliis activity was isolated from Polygonum cuspidatum and identified as emodin. In vitro anti-I. multifiliis results showed that emodin at 1 mg/L killed all I. multifiliis theronts for 96.0 min, and at 0.5 mg/L or lower concentrations could not kill all I. multifiliis theronts, but could significantly reduce the infectivity of theronts after pretreatment with emodin at the low concentrations mentioned above for 2 h. Additionally, emodin at 1 mg/L and 2 mg/L completely terminated the reproduction of nonencysted and encysted tomonts, respectively. In vivo tests, emodin at 0.5 mg/L could cure infected grass carp and protect naive fish from I. multifiliis infection by continuous adding emodin for 10 days. The 96 h median lethal concentration (LC50) of emodin to grass carp was 3.15 mg/L, which were approximately 18 and 7 times the median effective concentration (EC50) of emodin for killing theronts (0.18 mg/L) and nonencysted tomonts (0.45 mg/L), respectively. On the basis of these results, emodin is an effective compound for the development of a new drug against I. muldfiliis.

AB The aim of these studies was to determine the reduction in pasture infectivity likely to be achieved by the supplementation of grazing sheep with BioWorma, a product containing the chlamydospores of the nematophagous fungus Duddingtonia flagrans strain IAH 1297. Four placebo-controlled trials were conducted between 2009 and 2013 in sheep in different climatic regions of New South Wales and Queensland, Australia and across several seasons. The effectiveness of BioWorma was assessed by total worm counts in tracer sheep placed in paddocks grazed by parasitised sheep which were fed a daily supplement with and without BioWorma under group-feeding conditions. Further proof of concept was obtained by assessing the worm burdens and weight gains of the parasitised sheep, as well as the number of anthelmintic ("salvage") treatments required when faecal egg counts exceeded a threshold level.
   Significant reductions ranging from 57 to 84% (P < 0.05) in worm burdens of the tracer sheep placed in the paddock grazed by BioWorma treated sheep were obtained in all four trials, compared to the Control group. In two of the studies the treatment effect was greater at the end of the trial, indicating that pasture infectivity in the Control paddocks had risen considerably. The main nematodes encountered were Haemonchus spp., Trichostrongylus spp., and Teladorsagia spp. (including multi-resistant strains) and significant reductions were demonstrated for each of these species.
   Given the results of the four trials it can be concluded that supplementation of pastured sheep with BioWorma was effective in reducing the numbers of parasitic nematode larvae ingested by tracer sheep. It is considered that these levels of reduced pasture larvae would result in productivity increases in grazing sheep and reduce the requirement for intervention with anthelmintic chemicals. Therefore, use of BioWorma will provide an alternative means for control of gastrointestinal nematode (GIN) parasites on pasture.

AB Trichinella is an important zoonotic parasite found in a range of wildlife species harvested for food and fur in Canada. We compared larval intensity from tongue and diaphragm, the best predilection sites in other animal species, from naturally infected, wild wolverines (Cub gulo) (n = 95). Muscle larvae of Trichinella spp. were recovered by the pepsin/HCl artificial digestion method (gold standard) using double separatory funnels, and species were identified using multiplex PCR. Prevalence was 83% (79/95). Of those positive for Trichinella spp. (n = 79), 76 (96.2%) were detected in both tissues, 2 (2.5%) were positive only on diaphragm, and 1 (1.3%) only on tongue. A total of 62 of 79 wolverines (78.5%) had higher larval burden in tongue than in diaphragm, whereas 17 wolverines (21.5%) had higher larval burden in diaphragm. The predilection site (higher larval burden) of Trichinella spp. larvae did not vary significantly between juvenile and adult wolverines (P = 0.2), between male and female wolverines (P = 0.9), and among wolverines classified as having low and high larval intensities overall (P = 0.2). Trichinella T6 was the predominant genotype (63 of 79; 80%), followed by T. nativa (T2) (6 of 79; 8%). Mixed infections of T2 and T6 were observed in 9 of 79 (12%) wolverines. Larval intensity of Trichinella T6 was higher in tongues than diaphragms. No statement can be made for T2 due to insufficient T2 positive samples. In conclusion, tongues are a better site for sampling than diaphragms in future surveys of Trichinella larval intensity in wolverines; however, either tissue is suitable for prevalence studies.

AB Salinization of freshwaters by human activities is of growing concern globally. Consequences of salt pollution include adverse effects to aquatic biodiversity, ecosystem function, human health, and ecosystem services. In headwater streams of the temperate forests of eastern USA, elevated specific conductance (SC), a surrogate measurement for the major dissolved ions composing salinity, has been linked to decreased diversity of aquatic insects. However, such linkages have typically been based on limited numbers of SC measurements that do not quantify intra-annual variation. Effective management of salinization requires tools to accurately monitor and predict salinity while accounting for temporal variability. Toward that end, high-frequency SC data were collected within the central Appalachian coalfield over 4 years at 25 forested headwater streams spanning a gradient of salinity. A sinusoidal periodic function was used to model the annual cycle of SC, averaged across years and streams. The resultant model revealed that, on average, salinity deviated approximately +/- 20% from annual mean levels across all years and streams, with minimum SC occurring in late winter and peak SC occurring in late summer. The pattern was evident in headwater streams influenced by surface coal mining, unmined headwater reference streams with low salinity, and larger-order salinized rivers draining the study area. The pattern was strongly responsive to varying seasonal dilution as driven by catchment evapotranspiration, an effect that was amplified slightly in unmined catchments with greater relative forest cover. Evaluation of alternative sampling intervals indicated that discrete sampling can approximate the model performance afforded by high-frequency data but model error increases rapidly as discrete sampling intervals exceed 30 days. This study demonstrates that intra-annual variation of salinity in temperate forested headwater streams of Appalachia USA follows a natural seasonal pattern, driven by interactive influences on water quantity and quality of climate, geology, and terrestrial vegetation. Because climatic and vegetation dynamics vary annually in a seasonal, cyclic manner, a periodic function can be used to fit a sinusoidal model to the salinity pattern. The model framework used here is broadly applicable in systems with streamflow-dependent chronic salinity stress. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Struvite precipitation is a well-documented method for recovering up to 98% of phosphorus from urine, which is one of the main nutrients in fertilizers besides nitrogen and potassium. Shortcomings of this process, however, are the low nitrogen recovery ratio and the possible uptake of pharmaceuticals from urine. In this work, the NH4+ adsorbent materials biochar and zeolite are coupled with struvite precipitation to increase the N-recovery of struvite from 5.7% to 9.8%. Since nitrogen is one of the main nutrients in fertilisers, this increase is of significance for its potential commercial use. In addition, urine is spiked with pharmaceuticals to measure the consequential uptake in struvite-based fertilisers and crops afterwards. Five fertilisers are prepared by nutrient recovery from spiked urine using: (1) struvite crystallisation, (2) struvite crystallisation combined with N adsorption on zeolite, (3) struvite crystallisation combined with N adsorption on biochar, (4) N adsorption on zeolite without struvite crystallisation, and (5) N adsorption on biochar without struvite crystallisation. The fertiliser with the highest purity product and the lowest uptake of pharmaceuticals was struvite combined with zeolite.
   Next, the contaminated struvite-sorbent fertilisers are tested in a crop trial in which the bio-accumulation of pharmaceuticals in edible plant tissue (tomatoes) is measured. This bioaccumulation in tomato fruit biomass from each of the spiked fertilisers in the crop trial was found to be lower than 0.0003% in all cases, far below the acceptable daily intake (ADI) levels (750 kg of dry tomatoes should be consumed per day to reach the ADI limit). Consequently, the subsequent risk to human health from tomato fruit grown using urine derived struvite-sorbent fertilisers is found to be insignificant. (C) 2018 The Authors.

AB Start-up of biofilm process initiated by the deposition of soluble matters on biocarriers is a very important yet time-consuming procedure. However, rapid start-up methods especially in the enhancement of soluble matters deposition have been rarely addressed. In this study, a quartz crystal micro balance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) was applied to investigate the influences of calcium ion and rhamnolipid (RL) on the deposition of soluble matters from real and synthetic industrial wastewaters with different configurations of organics (bovine serum albumin and sodium alginate) and ionic strength on the model biocarriers polystyrene and polyamide. Results showed that deposition was effectively promoted by the addition of Ca2+ and along with the increase in Ca2+ content. However, RL enhanced the deposition effectively only in hyperhaline wastewater through breaking hydration repulsion and decreased the deposition in low-salinity wastewater, and its influence to the deposited layer property exhibited characteristics of negative feedback. The combined use of Ca2+ and RL had a better enhancement effect than that of separate use and the mechanism involved can not be soundly explained only by Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory. The strategy of mediating the deposition of soluble matters on different biocarriers by adding Ca2+ and RL has important implications for regulating biofilm formation to accelerate the start-up process in attached-growth bioreactors.

AB Cold atmospheric plasmas are weakly ionized gases that can be generated in ambient air. They produce energetic species (e.g. electrons, metastables) as well as reactive oxygen species, reactive nitrogen species, UV radiations and local electric field. Their interaction with a liquid such as tap water can hence change its chemical composition. The resulting "plasma-activated liquid" can meet many applications, including medicine and agriculture.
   Consequently, a complete experimental set of analytical techniques dedicated to the characterization of long lifetime chemical species has been implemented to characterize tap water treated using cold atmospheric plasma process and intended to agronomy applications. For that purpose, colorimetry and acid titrations are performed, considering acid-base equilibria, pH and temperature variations induced during plasma activation. 16 species are quantified and monitored: hydroxide and hydronium ions, ammonia and ammonium ions, orthophosphates, carbonate ions, nitrite and nitrate ions and hydrogen peroxide. The related consumption/production mechanisms are discussed. In parallel, a chemical model of electrical conductivity based on Kohlrausch's law has been developed to simulate the electrical conductivity of the plasma-activated tap water (PATW). Comparing its predictions with experimental measurements leads to a narrow fitting, hence supporting the self-sufficiency of the experimental set, I.e. the fact that all long lifetime radicals of interest present in PATW are characterized.
   Finally, to evaluate the potential of cold atmospheric plasmas for agriculture applications, tap water has been daily plasma-treated to irrigate lentils seeds. Then, seedlings lengths have been measured and compared with untreated tap water, showing an increase as high as 34.0% and 128.4% after 3 days and 6 days of activation respectively. The interaction mechanisms between plasma and tap water are discussed as well as their positive synergy on agronomic results. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Vacuum-Ultraviolet (VUV), an efficient and green method to produce hydroxyl radical (center dot OH), is effective in degrading numerous organic contaminants in aqueous solution. Here, we proposed an effective and simple kinetic model to describe the degradation of organic pollutants in VUV system, by taking the center dot OH scavenging effects of formed organic intermediates as co-existing organic matter in whole. Using benzoic acid (BA) as a center dot OH probe, center dot OH was regarded vital for pollutant degradation in VUV system, and the thus developed model successfully predicted its degradation kinetics under different conditions. Effects of typical influencing factors such as BA concentrations and UV intensity were investigated quantitatively by the model. Temperature was found to be an important influencing factor in the VUV system, and the quantum yield of center dot OH showed a positive linear dependence on temperature. impacts of humic acid (HA), alkalinity, chloride, and water matrices (realistic waters) on the oxidation efficiency were also examined. BA degradation was significantly inhibited by HA due to its scavenging of center dot OH, but was influenced much less by the alkalinity and chloride; high oxidation efficiency was still obtained in the realistic water. The degradation kinetics of three other typical micropollutants including bisphenol A (SPA), nitrobenzene (NB) and dimethyl phthalate (DMP), and the mixture of co-existing BA, BPA and DMP were further studied, and the developed model predicted the experimental data well, especially in realistic water. It is expected that this study will provide an effective approach to predict the degradation of organic micropollutants by the promising VUV system, and broaden the application of VUV system in water treatment.

AB Pharmaceutical wastewaters containing antibiotics and high salinity can damage traditional biological treatment and result in the proliferation of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Bioelectrochemical system (BES) is a promising approach for treating pharmaceutical wastewater. However, the fate of ARGs in BES and their correlations with microbial communities and horizontal genes transfer are unknown. In this study, we investigated the response of ARGs to bio-electrochemical treatment of chloramphenicol wastewater and their potential hosts under different salinities. Three ARGs encoding efflux pump (cmlA, floR and tetC), one class 1 integron integrase encoding gene (intl1), and sul1 gene (associate with intl1) were analyzed. Correlation analysis between microbial community and ARGs revealed that the abundances of potential hosts of ARGs were strongly affected by salinity, which further determined the alteration in ARGs abundances under different salinities. There were no significant correlations between ARGs and intl1, indicating that horizontal gene transfer was not related to the important changes in ARGs. Moreover, the chloramphenicol removal efficiency was enhanced under a moderate salinity, attributed to the altered microbial community driven by salinity. Therefore, microbial community shift is the major factor for the changes of ARGs and chloramphenicol removal efficiency in BES under different salinities. This study provides new insights on the mechanisms underlying the alteration of ARGs in BES treating high-salinity pharmaceutical wastewater. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Environmental gradient have strong effects on community assembly processes. In order to reveal the effects of alkaline mine drainage (AIkMD) on bacterial and denitrifying bacterial community compositions and diversity in tailings reservoir, here we conducted an experiment to examine all and core bacterial taxa and denitrifying functional genes's (nirS, nirK, nosZ(I)) abundance along a chemical gradient in tailings water in Shibahe copper tailings in Zhongtiaoshan, China. Differences in bacterial and denitrifying bacterial community compositions in different habitats and their relationships with environmental parameters were analyzed. The results showed that the richness and diversity of bacterial community in downstream seeping water (SDSW) were the largest, while that in upstream tailings water (STW1) were the lowest. The diversity and abundance of bacterial communities tended to increase from STW1 to SDSW. The variation of bacterial community diversity was significantly related to electro-conductibility (EC), nitrate (NO3-), nitrite (NO2-), total carbon (TC), inorganic carbon (IC) and sulfate (SO42-), but was not correlated with geographic distance in local scale. Core taxa from class to genus were all significantly related to NO3- and NO2-. Core taxa Rhodobacteraceae, Rhodobacter, Acinetobacter and Hydrogenophaga were typical denitrifying bacteria. The variation trends of these groups were consistent with the copy number of nirS, nirK and nosZI, demonstrating their importance in the process of nitrogen reduction. The copy number of nirK, nosZ(I) and nirS/16S rDNA, nirK/16Sr DNA correlated strongly with NON, NOT and IC, but nirS and nosZ(I)/16SrDNA had no significant correlation with NO3- and NOT. The copy numbers of denitrifying functional genes (nirS, nirK and nosZI) were negatively correlated with heavy metal plumbum (Pb) and zinc (Zn). It showed that heavy metal contamination was an important factor affecting the structure of denitrifying bacterial community in AIkMD. In this study we have identified the distribution pattern of bacterial community along physiochemical gradients in alkaline tailings reservoir and displayed the driving force of shaping the structure of bacterial community. The influence of NON, NOT, IC and heavy metal Pb and Zn on bacterial community might via their influence on the functional groups involving nitrogen, carbon and metal metabolisms.

AB Arsenic contamination in groundwater is a critical issue and one that raises great concern around the world as the cause of many negative health impacts on the human body, including internal and external cancers. There are many ways to remove or immobilize arsenic, including membrane technologies, adsorption, sand filtration, ion exchange, and capacitive deionization. These exhibit many different advantages and disadvantages. Among these methods, in-situ subsurface arsenic immobilization by aeration and the subsequent removal of arsenic from the aqueous phase has shown to be very a promising, convenient technology with high treatment efficiency. In contrast to most of other As remediation technologies, in-situ subsurface immobilization offers the advantage of negligible waste production and hence has the potential of being a sustainable treatment option. This paper reviews the application of subsurface arsenic removal (SAR) technologies as well as current modeling approaches. Unlike subsurface iron removal (SIR), which has proven to be technically feasible in a variety of hydrogeochemical settings for many years, SAR is not yet an established solution since it shows vulnerability to diverse geochemical conditions such as pH, Fe:As ratio, and the presence of co-ions. In some situations, this makes it difficult to comply with the stringent guideline value for drinking water recommended by the WHO (10 mu g L-1). In order to overcome its limitations, more theoretical and experimental studies are needed to show long-term application achievements and help the development of SAR processes into state-of-the-art technology.

AB By simulating decreasing inflow concentrations, the extent of desorption of organic micropollutants (OMP) from three activated carbons (AC) was examined in laboratory batch tests. The tested AC showed strong differences in pore size distribution and could therefore be characterized as typical micro-, meso- and macroporous AC, respectively. Adsorption and desorption conditions were varied by using drinking water (containing dissolved organic matter (DOM)) and DOM-free pure water as background solutions to examine the influence of DOM on OMP desorption for the different AC. Under ideal conditions (adsorption and desorption in pure water) adsorption of the tested OMP was found to be highly up to completely reversible for all tested AC. Under real conditions (adsorption and desorption in drinking water) additional DOM adsorption affects desorption in different ways depending on the AC pore structure. For the micro- and mesoporous AC, an increased irreversibility of OMP adsorption was found, which shows that DOM adsorption prevents OMP desorption. This could be referred to pore blockage effects that occur during the parallel adsorption of DOM and OMP. For the macroporous AC, DOM adsorption led to an enhanced OMP desorption which could be attributed to displacement processes. These results show that smaller pores tend to be blocked by DOM which hinders OMP from desorption. The overall larger pores of the macroporous AC do not get blocked which could allow (i) OMP to desorb and (ii) DOM to enter and displace OMP. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A broad number of natural and synthetic progestins are widely used in human and veterinary therapies. Although progestins exhibit adverse effects in aquatic organisms, information about environmental occurrence and fate have been limited to several compounds, hampering the accuracy of risk assessments of the compounds. In this study, a selective and sensitive analytical method was established to simultaneously determine 19 natural and 42 synthetic progestins in environmental waters, and the synthetic progestins included 19-nortestosterone, 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone and progesterone derivatives. All of the target compounds were effectively separated using an HSS T3 column, and the recoveries for effluent and river samples were 80-115% and 75-105%, respectively. The detection limits for the 61 analytes were in the range of 0.05-0.60 ng/L and 0.03-0.40 ng/L for the effluent and river samples, respectively. The developed method is applied to analyze the target progestogens in sewage effluent and river water samples from Beijing. The detected concentrations of natural progesterone metabolites (3 alpha-hydroxy-5 beta-tetrahydroprogesterone) were up to 63 times higher than those of the parent compound. Of the three groups of synthetic progestins, the progesterone derivatives were detected for the first time and had the highest concentrations followed by the 19-nortestosterone and 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone derivatives. In contrast to previous studies, the predominant derivative compounds of 19-nortestosterone were found to be 19-nortestosterone, gestodene and mifepristone, and those of 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone were 6-epi-medroxy progesterone 17-acetate and melengestrol acetate. The toxicities and environmental risk of these emerging progestins deserves more attention in the future. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Algal growth causes a drastic change in aquatic conditions over a diel cycle, which may induce sensitive feedback systems in sediments, causing P release. In this study, a microcosm experiment was performed using a suction sampler (Rhizon) to observe changes in soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and soluble Fe(11) concentrations in the top 20 mm sediment layer on a 3-h time interval, at different phases of harmful algal bloom (HAB) development. The results showed that the algal blooms prevailed up to 15 days after incubation, after which the process of bloom collapse proceeded until the 70th day. The concentrations of pore-water soluble Fe(11) and SRP increased throughout the incubation period. Compared to day 1, maximum increases of 214% in soluble Fe(11) and 387% in SRP were observed at night during the bloom and collapse periods, respectively. The diffusive fluxes of Fe and P at the sediment water interface (SWI) generally corresponded to their changes in concentrations. Hourly fluctuation in soluble Fe(11) and SRP concentrations were observed with two distinct concentration peaks occurred at 21:00 p.m. and 06:00 am. (or 03:00 a.m.), respectively. These findings suggest that Fe-P coupling mechanisms are responsible for the release of P from sediments. During the collapse period, soluble Fe(11) concentrations were suppressed by the increase of labile S(-11) at night. Meanwhile, SRP concentrations were decoupled from Fe cycling with small fluctuations (<11% RSD) on an hourly timescale, and the decomposition of algae was a dominant source contributing to the release of P from sediments. These results significantly improved the understanding of processes and mechanisms behind the stimulated release of P from sediments during HABs. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Although the removal of Se(VI) from water by using zero-valent iron (ZVI) is a promising method, passivation of ZVI severely inhibits its performance. To overcome such issue, we proposed an efficient technique to enhance Se(VI) removal via pre-corrosion of ZVI with H2O2/HCl in a short time (15 min). The resultant pcZVI suspension was weakly acidic (pH 4.56) and contained abundant aqueous Fe2+. Fe-57 Mossbauer spectroscopy showed that pcZVI mainly consisted of Fe-0 (66.2%), hydrated ferric oxide (26.3%), and Fe3O4 (7.5%). Efficient removal of Se(VI) from sulfate-rich solution was achieved by pcZVI compared with ZVI (in the absence and presence of H2O2) and acid-pretreated ZVI. Moreover, the efficient removal of Se(VI) by pcZVl sustained over a broad pH range (3-9) due to its strong buffering power. The presence of chloride, carbonate, nitrate, and common cations (Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Mg2+) posed negligible influence on the removal of Se(VI) by pcZVI, while the inhibitory effect induced by sulfate, silicate, and phosphate indicated the significance of Se(VI) adsorption as a prerequisite step for its removal. The consumption of aqueous Fe2+ was associated with Se(VI) removal, and X-ray absorption near edge structure revealed that the main pathway for Se(VI) removal by pcZVI was a stepwise reduction of Se(VI) to Se(IV) and then Se-0 as the dominant final state (78.2%). Moreover, higher electron selectivity of pcZVI was attributed to the enhanced enrichment of Se oxyanions prior to their reduction. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Emerging contaminants, such as antibiotics, pharmaceuticals, personal care products, hormones, and artificial sweeteners, are recognized as new classes of water contaminants due to their proven or potential adverse effects on aquatic ecosystems and human health. This review provides comprehensive data on the occurrence of 60 emerging contaminants (ECs) in influent, treated effluent, sludge, and biosolids in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). In particular, data on the occurrence of ECs in the influents and effluents of WWTPs are systematically summarized and categorized according to geographical regions (Asia, Europe, and North America). The occurrence patterns of ECs in raw influent and treated effluents of WWTPs between geographical regions were compared and evaluated. Concentrations of most ECs in raw influent in Asian region tend to be higher than those in European and North American countries. Many antibiotics were detected in the influents and effluents of WWTPs at concentrations close to or exceeding the predicted no-effect concentrations (PNECs) for resistance selection. The efficacy of EC removal by sorption and biodegradation during wastewater treatment processes are discussed in light of kinetics and parameters, such as sorption coefficients (K-d) and biodegradation constants (k(biol)), and physicochemical properties (i.e. log K-ow and pK(a)). Commonly used sampling and monitoring strategies are critically reviewed. Analytical research needs are identified, and novel investigative approaches for future monitoring studies are proposed.

AB With the accelerated application of CeO2 nanoparticles (NPs), wastewater treatment plants will increasingly receive CeO2 NPs, thus inevitably causing CeO2 NPs to encounter microaggregates. Here, we comprehensively elucidate the responses in the structural, physicochemical and microbial properties of wastewater biofilms to chronic exposure (75 days) to different CeO2 NPs concentrations, with a particular emphasis on the protective mechanisms of stratified extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs). Chronic exposure to 0.1 mg/L CeO2 NPs boosted the content and broadened the distribution of alpha-D-glucopyranose polysaccharides (PS), while the sharply increased production and breadth of beta-D-glucopyranose PS, forming a formidable shield, was a response to 10 mg/L CeO2 NPs. After the bacteria were exposed to CeO2 NPs, loosely bound EPSs (LB-EPSs) aggregated into macromolecules (increasing in apparent molecular weight (AMW)) but at a lower abundance, whereas the average AMW in tightly bound EPSs (TB-EPSs) decreased. The acetyl content and (alpha-helix+3-turn helix)/beta-sheet value of TB-EPSs increased to resist CeO2 NPs. Furthermore, long-term exposure to CeO2 NPs decreased cell viability, reduced microbial diversity and shifted the microbial composition. N-acylated-L-homoserine lactone concentrations increased with increased density of Pseudomonas, which was associated with PS -regulated control, thus promoting PS production in EPSs in response to CeO2 NPs. These results expand the understanding of how microaggregates resist environmental stress caused by NPs. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Remarkable atrazine degradation in the S(IV) autoxidation process catalyzed by Fe2+-Mn2+ (Fe2+/Mn2+/sulfite) was demonstrated in this study. Competitive kinetic experiments, alcohol inhibiting methods and electron spin resonance (ESR) experiments proved that sulfur radicals were not the major oxidation species. Mn(III) was demonstrated to be the primary active species in the Fe2+/Mn(2+/)sulfite process based on the comparison of oxidation selectivity. Moreover, the inhibiting effect of the Mn(III) hydrolysis and the S(IV) autoxidation in the presence of organic contaminants indicated the existence of three Mn(III) consumption routes in the Fe2+/Mn2+/sulfite process. The absence of hydroxyl radical and sulfate radical was interpreted by the competitive dynamics method. The oxidation capacity of the Fe2+/Mn2+/sulfite was independent of the initial pH (4.0-6.0) because the fast decay of S(IV) decreased initial pH below 4.0 rapidly. The rate of ATZ degradation was independent of the dissolved oxygen (DO) because that the major DO consumption process was not the rate determining step during the production of SO5 center dot-. Phosphate and bicarbonate were confirmed to have greater inhibitory effects than other environmental factors because of their strong pH buffering capacity and complexing capacity for Fe3+. The proposed acetylation degradation pathway of ATZ showed the application of the Fe2+/Mn2+/sulfite process in the research of contaminants degradation pathways. This work investigated the characteristics of the Fe2+/Mn2+/sulfite process in the presence of organic contaminants, which might promote the development of Mn(III) oxidation technology.

AB Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are acting as routes of microplastics (MPs) to the environment, hence the urgent need to examine MPs in wastewaters and different types of sludge through sampling campaigns covering extended periods of time. In this study, the efficiency of a municipal WWTP to remove MPs from wastewater was studied by collecting wastewater and sludge samples once in every two weeks during a 3-month sampling campaign. The WWTP was operated based on the conventional activated sludge (CAS) process and a pilot-scale membrane bioreactor (MBR). The microplastic particles and fibers from both water and sludge samples were identified by using an optical microscope, Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) microscope and Raman microscope. Overall, the retention capacity of micro plastics in the studied WWTP was found to be 98.3%. Most of the MP fraction was removed before the activated sludge process. The efficiency of an advanced membrane bioreactor (MBR) technology was also examined. The main related finding is that MBR permeate contained 0.4 MP/L in comparison with the final effluent of the CAS process (1.0 MP/L). According to this study, both microplastic fibers and particles are discharged from the WWTP to the aquatic environment. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Coagulation is often applied as a pre-treatment for membrane processes to reduce dissolved organic matter and to prevent membrane fouling. Biopolymers (BPs) have repeatedly been reported as major organic foulants, and coagulation conditions such as pH or dose have been optimised to minimise the remaining BPs. Optimisation however remains problematic because of the complex and heterogenetic nature of BP. In this study, the behaviour of several BP fractions in a coagulation process was investigated by excitation-emission matrix-parallel factor analysis (EEM-PARAFAC) following liquid chromatography (LC)-fractionation. Using a series of jar tests, we found that BP removal depends on the type of source water, reflecting differences in charge neutralisation conditions in three samples of natural water despite nearly identical processes for removing humic substances. This result demonstrates the complexity of optimisation for BP coagulation. Fractionation of EEM-PARAFAC to BP by LC showed that at least three organic component groups (C1, C2 and C3) constitute BP. Cl is tryptophan-like organic matter that is often found in wastewater effluent, C2 is tyrosine-like organic matter that has a phenolic chemical structure, and C3 is a humic-like substance. Cl was removed thoroughly at acidic pH but not at neutral pH, while the removal of C2 was inefficient even with a significant change in pH or dose, indicating similar difficulties in a coagulation process. The difference in components C1 and C2 may partly explain the difference in efficiencies of removal of BP in water from different sources. Our investigation suggests that the optimisation or selection of appropriate pre-treatment processes for membrane systems should be substantially based on the composition of BPs (e.g., C1 and C2 components).

AB Ammonium and/or free ammonia (the unionized form of ammonium) are generally thought to inhibit the activities of microbes involved in anaerobic digestion of waste activated sludge. It was found in this work, however, that the presence of ammonium (NH4+-N) largely enhanced dark fermentative hydrogen production from alkaline pretreated-sludge. With the increase of initial NH4+-N level from 36 to 266 mg/L, the maximal hydrogen production from alkaline (pH 9.5) pretreated-sludge increased from 7.3 to 15.6 mL per gram volatile suspended solids (VSS) under the standard condition. Further increase of NH4+-N to 308 mg/L caused a slight decrease of hydrogen yield (15.0 mL/g VSS). Experimental results demonstrated that free ammonia instead of NH4+-N was the true contributor to the enhancement of hydrogen production. It was found that the presence of free ammonia facilitated the releases of both extracellular and intracellular constituents, which thereby provided more substrates for subsequent hydrogen production. The free ammonia at the tested levels (i.e., 0-444 mg/L) did not affect acetogenesis significantly. Although free ammonia inhibited all other bio-processes, its inhibition to the hydrogen consumption processes (i.e., homoacetogenesis, methanogenesis, and sulfate-reducing process) was much severer than that to the hydrolysis and acidogenesis processes. Further investigations with enzyme analyses showed that free ammonia posed slight impacts on protease, butyrate kinase, acetate kinase, CoA-transferase, and [FeFe] hydrogenase activities but largely suppressed the activities of coenzyme F420, carbon monoxide dehydrogenase, and adenylyl sulfate reductase, which were consistent with the chemical analyses performed above.

AB Treatment of wastewater for potable reuse requires the reduction of enteric viruses to levels that pose no significant risk to human health. Advanced water treatment trains (e.g., chemical clarification, reverse osmosis, ultrafiltration, advanced oxidation) have been developed to provide reductions of viruses to differing levels of regulatory control depending upon the levels of human exposure and associated health risks. Importance in any assessment is information on the concentration and types of viruses in the untreated wastewater, as well as the degree of removal by each treatment process. However, it is critical that the uncertainty associated with virus concentration and removal or inactivation by wastewater treatment be understood to improve these estimates and identifying research needs. We reviewed the critically literature to assess to identify uncertainty in these estimates. Biological diversity within families and genera of viruses (e.g. enteroviruses, rotaviruses, adenoviruses, reoviruses, noroviruses) and specific virus types (e.g. serotypes or genotypes) creates the greatest uncertainty. These aspects affect the methods for detection and quantification of viruses and anticipated removal efficiency by treatment processes. Approaches to reduce uncertainty may include; 1) inclusion of a virus indicator for assessing efficiency of virus concentration and detection by molecular methods for each sample, 2) use of viruses most resistant to individual treatment processes (e.g. adenoviruses for UV light disinfection and reoviruses for chlorination), 3) data on ratio of virion or genome copies to infectivity in untreated wastewater, and 4) assessment of virus removal at field scale treatment systems to verify laboratory and pilot plant data for virus removal.

AB The widespread occurrence of pharmaceuticals and their metabolites in natural waters has raised great concerns about their potential risks on human health and ecological systems. This study systematically investigates the degradation of sulfasalazine (SSZ) and its two human metabolites, sulfapyridine (SPD) and 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), by UV and UV/peroxydisulfate (UV/PDS) processes. Experimental results show that SPD and 5-ASA were readily degraded upon UV 254 nm direct photolysis, with quantum yields measured to be (8.6 +/- 0.8) x 10(-3) and (2.4 +/- 0.1) x 10(-2) mol Einstein(-1), respectively. Although SSZ was resistant to direct UV photolysis, it could be effectively removed by both UV/H2O2 and UV/PDS processes, with fluence-based pseudo-first-order rate constants determined to be 0.0030 and 0.0038 cm(2) mJ(-1), respectively. Second-order rate constant between SO4 center dot- and SSZ was measured as (1.33 +/- 0.01) x 10(9) M-1 s(-1) by competition kinetic method. A kinetic model was established for predicting the degradation rate of SSZ in the UV/PDS process. Increasing the dosage of PDS significantly enhanced the degradation of SSZ in the UV/PDS process, which can be well predicted by the developed kinetic model. Natural water constituents, such as natural organic matter (NOM) and bicarbonate (HCO3-), influenced the degradation of SSZ differently. The azo functional group of SSZ molecule was predicted as the reactive site susceptible to electrophilic attack by SO4 center dot- by frontier electron densities (FEDs) calculations. Four intermediate products arising from azo bond cleavage and SO2 extrusion were identified by solid phase extraction-liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (SPE-LC-MS/MS). Based on the products identified, detailed transformation pathways for SSZ degradation in the UV/PDS system were proposed. Results reveal that UV/PDS could be an efficient approach for remediation of water contaminated by SSZ and its metabolites. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Carbon-based engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) are widely used in consumer products due to their small size and unique physicochemical properties. Therefore, their release and distribution into the surface and subsurface environment is a subject of concern. Several studies have evaluated the transport and retention of carbon nanotubes and fullerenes, but none investigated the transport and retention of carbon dots (CDs). The aim of this research is to fill this knowledge gap by evaluating the transport and retention of CDs in saturated and unsaturated porous medium. Here, we investigate the effects of solution ionic strength (IS, 1-700 mM NaCI) and pH (4-9), the initial concentration of CDs (50-200 mg L-1), and porous media grain size (0.20-0.50 mm, 0.50-1 mm, 1-1.5 mm and 1.5-2 mm grain diameters) on the transport and retention of CDs in saturated (upward flow) and unsaturated (downward flow) quartz porous media. A mathematical model based on the advection-dispersion equation coupled with the second-order kinetics was used to fit the breakthrough curves and to calculate the attachment and straining rates under the different experimental conditions. These analyses were underpinned by characterization of CD surface functional groups, surface charge and aggregation under the different experimental conditions, calculation of CD-CD and CD-quartz sand interaction potential according to DLVO theory.
   Transport and retention of CDs in quartz porous media are consistent with those observed for other types of carbon-based ENPs such as fullerenes and carbon nanotubes. Mobility of CDs in both saturated and unsaturated porous media increases with the decrease in ionic strength, increase in pH, and increase in collector grain size. Retention of CDs increases with the increase in IS, decrease in pH and decrease in grain size. Generally, CDs mobility was higher under saturated than under unsaturated flow conditions, for the same experimental conditions. Overall, CDs tend to be highly mobile and could travel for long distances at a wide range of environmental conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Internal combustion engines are used to translate the chemical energy of fuel to the brake power and over two third of energy is wasted in the form of exergy and anergy in this process. An experimental energy balance analysis can make the engine energy flow clear and help to recycle the exergy of exhaust gas to increase brake thermal efficiency. In this paper, the effect of five different parameters on the energy distribution was investigated using heat balance test data from a 2.3 L turbocharged hydrogen engine. The results show that when proportion of exhaust gas energy ranges from 24.1% to 36.4% with various engine speeds, brake thermal efficiency can increase 3.69% at 2000 rpm and 7.67% at 4000 rpm with various load, which means that high engine speed and load are beneficial to increase exergy of total system. Both Engine speed and brake thermal efficiency increase with equivalence ratio ranging from 0.4 to 0.9, while proportion of energy of cooling system decreases, which means that both power and economic ascend with increasing equivalence ratio and anergy of total system decreases at low engine speed and load. Furthermore, proportion of exhaust gas energy can increase by 3% at 75% load and 2.5% at 50% load with spark timing dosing to TDC and NOx emission is decreasing. Finally, the variation of the coolant temperature has an almost negligible effect in terms of brake thermal efficiency but it can decrease anergy of total system.

AB In this work, the thermal behaviors, kinetic parameters, high pressure properties, and product characteristics of Qi 40 heavy oil in air, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, oxygen-denuded air, and flue gas atmospheres were systematically and comparatively studied by thermogravimetric analysis, kinetic analysis, pressure-volume-temperature test, and stimulation experiments. The thermal decomposition of heavy oil occurred in three major zones. The comprehensive devolatilization indices of heavy oil in nitrogen, carbon dioxide, oxygen-denuded air, air, and flue gas atmospheres were 3.32 x 10(-7), 2.94 x 10(-7), 2.07 x 10(-7), 2.30 x 10(-7), and 2.58 x 10(-7) % K-3 min(-2), respectively. The kinetics analysis indicated that, except for zone 2 in oxygen-denuded air, the best kinetic models of three zones were (1 - x)(1/3), (1 - x)(3/4), and (1 - x), respectively. Pressure volume-temperature tests displayed that the high pressure properties of heavy oil were mainly influenced by the gas solubility effects at low temperatures, and the heating effects at high temperatures. Moreover, Fourier transform infrared spectra, crude oil group, element, and gas chromatography analysis on products from stimulation experiments of heavy oil all showed that the product characteristics might be influenced by the existence of oxygen in the non-condensable gases. The results of this study provided useful information for potential application of non-condensable gases injection on thermal enhanced oil recovery.

AB Heat load variations in district heating systems lead to increased costs for heat generation and, in most cases, increased greenhouse gas emissions associated with the marginal use of fossil fuels. This work investigates the benefits of applying thermal energy storage in district heating systems to decrease heat load variations, comparing storage using a hot water tank and the thermal inertia of buildings (with similar storage capacity). A detailed techno-economic optimisation model is applied to the district heating system of Goteborg, Sweden. The results show that both the hot water tank and the thermal inertia of buildings benefit the operation of the district heating system and have similar dynamics of utilisation. However, compared to the thermal inertia of buildings, the hot water tank stores more than twice as much heat over the modelled year, owing to lower energy losses. For the same reason, only the hot water tank is used to store heat for periods longer than a few days. Furthermore, the hot water tank has its full capacity available for charging/discharging at all times, whereas the capacity of the thermal inertia of buildings depends on the heat transfer between the building core and its indoor air and internals. Finally, the total system yearly operating cost decreases by 1% when the thermal inertia of buildings and by 2% when the hot water tank is added to the district heating system, as compared to the scenario without any storage.

AB A partially recuperative gas turbine combined cycle (GTCC(Pr)) is proposed in this paper to improve the off-design performance of power plants. The performance coupling with a new operation strategy is also analyzed. In the proposed GTCC(Pr), the gas flow at the outlet of the turbine is divided into two streams, and only a part of exhaust gas from the turbine is used to preheat the outlet air of the compressor. Exhaust gas streams from the recuperator are mixed with flue from the second reheater at the inlet of the first reheater to achieve similar temperature level. Specifically, the fraction of exhaust gas that preheats air can be changed to adjust the load of the combined cycle. The PG9351FA gas turbine unit is selected as the reference unit for comparison. Then, the design/off-design characteristics of the two cycles are compared and analyzed with the same turbine initial temperature. Results indicate that the partially recuperative GTCC(Pr) running with the new operation has better off-design performances than the reference unit with approximately 1.7% maximum difference of efficiency. At the design point, the exhaust gas used for partial recuperation only accounts for 10% of the total mass, and the effect of recuperation is not evident. Therefore, the two cycles possess nearly similar output and efficiency. The efficiency of partially recuperative GTCC(Pr) is nearly unchanged with the increasing recuperative mass fraction, which changes its specific power to adjust the load. At low loads, with decreasing turbine exhaust gas temperature, the efficiency improvement also decreases due to the partial recuperation. A comprehensive comparison with the reference unit revealed that GTCC(Pr) with the proposed "recuperation adjustment" method can maintain a higher off-design efficiency and slightly lower design power output compared with the conventional cycle. Specific power adjustment of recuperation is one of the efficient methods for load adjustment, and GTCC(Pr) is one of the best options.

AB In this paper, a solar double absorption heat transformer (SDAHT) operating with the LiBr-H2O solution is proposed to provide high temperature energy. The flat plate collector (FPC) is used to supply the demanded heat input in the present configuration, which will greatly broaden the application scope of the FPCs. The thermo-economic concept is applied to the evaluation and optimization of the SDAHT, aimed at minimizing its annual capital cost per kilowatt heat capacity (CPK) and payback period (PP). A dedicated computer model in the software Engineering Equation Solver was developed to conduct the study by means of a parametric analysis. The results show that there exists an optimum absorber/evaporator temperature at which CPK and PP can obtain the minimum values. With solar radiation intensity at 600 W/m(2), generation (evaporation) temperature at 75 degrees C, condensation temperature at 38 degrees C, absorption temperature at 135 degrees C and economizer efficiency set to 0.8, the optimum absorber/evaporator temperature and corresponding CPIC and PP are 104.0 degrees C, 928.1 euros/kW and 4.0 years, respectively. The cost of the FPCs takes the major part of CPK. Moreover, the effects of the operating parameters such as the generation (evaporation), condensation, absorption temperatures and design parameters including the first and second economizer efficiencies on the optimum absorber/evaporator temperature and corresponding CPK and PP have been analyzed in detail. Besides, some suggestions derived from the results are also given to assist the engineers in estimation of the economic performance.

AB A novel cascade organic Rankine cycle (ORC) configuration involving ejector refrigeration loops is introduced to produce liquefied natural gas (LNG) and power. Linear Fresnel solar collectors are utilized to supply the required energy of the system. Exergy, exergoeconomic and exergoenvironmental concepts are undertaken upon the concerned system during a year. A multi-objective optimization procedure based on a fast and elitist non dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is conducted and three decision makers, i.e. Shannon Entropy, LINMAP and TOPSIS methods are employed to find the ultimate optimum thermodynamic, economic and environmental impact performances from Pareto frontier obtained by NSGA-II with corresponding design variables of the system. As a result, the solar radiation increment affects the efficiencies negatively and the lowest total product cost and EI rates are obtained within 78.588 $/h in May and 77.544 Pts/h in December, respectively. The optimum energy and exergy efficiencies are achieved respectively by about 7.3% and 12.6% in relation to the base point using Shannon Entropy decision maker. Moreover, the economic and El performances of the system are improved respectively within 1.2% and 1.1% through the LINMAP method so that the highest reduction may be obtained for the cost and EI per unit exergies of LNG within 0.4200 $/GJ and 7.36 Pts/GJ, respectively.

AB The optimization and assessment study of a thermal energy adsorption storage system is presented. The system integrates an adsorption heat storage module in a conventional hot water storage tank of a solar thermal system, operating with the silica-gel/water adsorption pair. The system was modeled using TRNSYS circle and MATLAB(circle), and was previously assessed and improved through a set of parametric tests for each main component. In this work, the GenOpt(circle) optimization software was used to obtain the optimal performance of the whole system. It is found that a slender and lengthy adsorber with a large number of thin fins, a thick and lengthy condenser, and an evaporator with a large number of lengthy tubes improve the system's performance, by increasing the heat transfer areas and the adsorbent mass. The performance also improves by controlling the adsorber-condenser valve only through the system's pressure and opening the evaporator-adsorber valve at the hot water setpoint temperature. The optimized system presents a 16% saving in annual backup energy consumption compared with a similar conventional storage system, thus validating the results of the previous segregated parametric study. This optimized system operates at the highest performance with the same configuration in different locations/ climates, as only the inclination of the solar collector affects the results: larger inclinations improve the system's performance, by favoring its operation in Winter. Results present this system as a promising solution to increase the energy storage capacity of solar thermal systems, and potentially of systems using other primary energy sources.

AB The effective compression ratio of spark ignition engines is influenced by several factors, and can feature a relatively wide range even for production power units. This is given mainly by the tolerances used for different components, but also due to the actual operating parameters that can result in different thermal regimes and therefore in dimensional variations. Given their design, optical engines are characterized by high crevice volumes and increased blow-by losses. Within this context, this work was aimed at developing a procedure for estimating the effective compression ratio and charge losses, based on the analysis of in-cylinder pressure traces. Compared to existing methods that require heat release rate modeling for ensuring good accuracy, the proposed route follows a different approach, that uses sub-models only for simulating heat transfer and blow-by losses. In this way, acceptable error levels were ensured, with minimum computational demand. The new procedure was applied on two different engine configurations, as well as operation with different fuels. Estimation of combustion efficiency was found to be an important issue for correct blow-by losses determination, while compression ratio evaluation depended mostly on the thermal regime of the piston.

AB In this paper, a previously developed Aspen Plus model for gasification of biomass was adapted to the gasification of microplastics in a temperature range of 400-1200 degrees C. The effect of parameters such as equivalence ratio (ER), steam-to-biomass ratio (SBR) and gasification temperature in hydrogen production was evaluated, as well as three different gasifying agents namely air, 02 and steam were tested. The relationship between all these variables was assessed in order to better characterize the final syngas. Results showed that for higher hydrogen yields, microplastics composition should be majorly polyethylene terephthalate (PET), assuring H-2 molar fraction contents in the order of 63-66%. The achieved lower heating value (LHV) was 9.2 MJ/Nm(3) which endorsed high-quality syngas.

AB In this paper a dynamic proton exchange membrane fuel cell model for real-time applications is presented. Following a quasi-2D approach, effects such as multicomponent diffusion in porous layers, membrane water transport driven by diffusion and electro-osmotic drag as well as membrane nitrogen crossover forced by partial pressure differences, are considered. A linearisation of the governing equations with respect to the previous time step is applied to avoid numerically expensive Newton iterations and to speed up the simulation. Furthermore, a solution method based on Chebyshev collocation minimises the required number of nodes and assures real-time capability. The model is validated in terms of polarisation curves, current density and species distribution versus steady-state computational fluid dynamics simulations of a 3D fuel cell performed in AVL Fire (TM). The transient behaviour is found to be in good qualitative agreement with results published by other authors. Due to the fast computation capability of the presented model, it is suitable for widespread parameter studies, control unit adjustments or state predictions, e.g. fuel starvation or membrane drying and flooding.

AB Accurate wind power forecast is essential for grid integration, system planning, and electricity trading in certain electricity markets. Therefore, analyzing prediction errors is a critical task that allows a comparison of prediction models and the selection of the most suitable model. In this work, the temporal error and absolute magnitude error are simultaneously considered to assess the forecast error. The trade-off between both types of errors is computed, analyzed, and interpreted. Moreover, a new index, the dynamic mean absolute error, DMAE, is defined to measure the prediction accuracy. This index accounts for both error components: temporal and absolute. Real cases of wind energy forecasting are used to illustrate the use of the new DMAE index and show the advantages of this new index over other error indices.

AB The aim of this work is to evaluate the performance of an intermittent personalized ventilation (PV) system assisting a displacement ventilation (DV) system based on its ability in improving thermal comfort and protecting occupants from floor emitted passive contaminants. A simplified transient mathematical model was developed of heat and species transport to predict the temperature and concentration fields in the macroclimate room air, in the thermal plume induced by the occupant and internal heat sources and within the intermittent PV jet facing the occupant face at a fixed distance. The model's predictions of temperature and concentration were experimentally validated for a PV frequency range [0.3-1 Hz] in a climatic chamber conditioned with a DV system assisted with an intermittent PV jet. Good agreement was found between the predicted and measured values of temperature and concentration of tracer gas in the different regions of macroclimate air, thermal plume, and PV jet.
   The validated model was used to conduct a case study where comfort and air quality were assessed and the energy consumption of the transient PV + DV system was compared to steady PV + DV and standalone DV systems. It was found that the intermittent PV range [0.3-1 Hz] was able to improve comfort compared to steady PV and provide acceptable air quality. Moreover, energy analysis showed that the intermittent PV + DV (40 L/s) was able to achieve maximum energy savings of 54.61% and 31.58% compared to a standalone DV and steady PV respectively for equivalent comfort.

AB A new power and cooling cogeneration cycle is proposed that combines the Kalina power cycle and the ejector absorption refrigeration cycle with an ammonia-water mixture as the working fluid. The proposed system, Kalina power-cooling with an ejector cycle (KPCE), originates from the Kalina power and cooling cycle (KPCC) and introduces an ejector before the evaporator. Thermodynamic analyses from the viewpoints of energy efficiency, as well as comparisons between KPCC and KPCE under the same initial conditions, were conducted for the cycles' refrigeration output and thermal efficiency. Energy analysis results showed that the KPCE provides a performance improvement without greatly increasing system complexity. At the same power production level, the refrigeration output and thermal efficiency of KPCE is 13.5% higher and 17% more than KPCC, respectively. Energy losses due to inefficient heat recovery design of the system are identified by cross heat pinch analysis. All three preheaters of the system showed an inefficient design of heat recovery. After redesigning, power, and power-cooling efficiencies showed 7% and 4.3% increases, respectively. The effect of four important input parameters including three pressure levels and ammonia mass fraction on the KPCE performance are investigated to optimize the system. The optimized KPCE performance improved by 17.9% and 13.6% for power and power-cooling efficiency while the total annual cost of the system could decrease by 6.8%.

AB Wind speed forecasting is an important technology in the wind power field; however, because of their chaotic nature, predicting wind speeds accurately is difficult. Aims at this challenge, a new hybrid model is proposed for short-term wind speed forecasting, where the short-term forecasting period is ten minutes. The model combines extreme learning machine with improved complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (ICEEMDAN) and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA). The extreme learning machine model is employed to obtain short-term wind speed predictions, while the autoregressive model is used to determine the best input variables. An ensemble method is used to improve the robustness of the extreme learning machine. To improve the prediction accuracy, the ICEEMDAN-ARIMA method is developed to post process the errors; this method can also be used to preprocess original wind speed. Additionally, this paper reports the results of a comparative study on preprocessing and postprocessing time series data. Three experimental results show that: (1) the error correction is effective in decreasing the prediction error, and the proposed models with error correction are suitable for short-term wind speed forecasting; (2) the ICEEMDAN method is more powerful than other variants of empirical mode decomposition in performing non-stationary decomposition, and the ICEEMDAN-ARIMA method achieves satisfactory performance both for preprocessing and post processing; and (3) for prediction, the preprocessing of time series is more effective than its postprocessing.

AB An inappropriate choice of isentropic efficiencies for the sizing of the component parts of monophasic ejectors is one of the greatest sources of error in their design. The present study shows that the replacement of isentropic efficiencies with polytropic efficiencies within 1D ejector models provides more accurate results. Polytropic efficiencies access more precisely the effects of the pressure ratio variation on the irreversibilities of the acceleration and deceleration processes. It is demonstrated that the deviation in the constant area duct length, calculated by using an isentropic efficiency from the real length is three times greater than the one calculated by using a polytropic efficiency. The polytropic efficiencies are extracted from the CFD modeling of two types of ejectors, a constant area mixing (CAM) ejector and a constant pressure mixing (CPM) ejector. A 1D thermodynamic model for CAM and CPM ejectors, based on the polytropic efficiency concept, is proposed and validated against experimental data. Parametric studies based on this model were completed. They reveal that the variation in polytropic efficiency of the primary nozzle has the most important impact on the constant area duct length. New empirical correlations to estimate the polytropic efficiencies are also provided.

AB The dynamic responses of a Li-ion battery pack deployed on hybrid electric vehicles are studied with a high fidelity finite element model and a parametric reduced-order model. The effects of microstructure transformation in the electrode materials caused by lithium-ion intercaladon/deintercalation on the evolution of dynamic responses are investigated including the effects of the state of charge, aging, and cell-to-cell variations. The dynamic responses obtained from a finite element analysis show two interesting phenomena. First, the high modal density is controllable with the design modification of a pack component. Second, dynamic responses, especially the evolution of the natural frequencies of the fixed-boundary modes, of a Li-ion battery pack provide useful information to estimate the dynamic states or health states of the battery. A probabilistic analysis is also carried out considering stochastic operational conditions of hybrid electric vehicles with a parametric reduced order model. The probabilistic analysis not only suggests appropriate modes and locations for monitoring its dynamic responses, but also determines the maximum response level of every cell in the battery pack. The proposed modeling approach can improve the safety and reliability of the structural design of battery cells and packs. Furthermore, it can be useful for the identification of the battery states during the operation.

AB In internal combustion engines, severe knock is a destructive phenomenon that would converge the energy released by fuel burning to damage the piston so that the engine can't work anymore, which should be avoided. The destruction mechanism have been revealed in previous researches in which the focusing of shock waves is considered as a main reason to cause the energy convergence and the destruction. However, the method to alleviate such shock wave focusing hasn't been put forward yet. Based on the destruction mechanism proposed before, in this research, a concave combustion chamber has been designed to alleviate the energy convergence of shock waves under severe knock so that the destruction of the piston under severe knock can be avoided. To validate the alleviation effect of the concave chamber, detonation bomb experiments have been conducted separately for the typical cone chamber and the redesigned concave chamber. Four pressure sensors installed in different positions of either chamber were used to monitor the shock wave behaviors and compare the energy convergence intensity for both of these two chambers. The experimental results prove that the concave chamber can efficiently alleviate the energy convergence in the center region. Furthermore, a series of numerical simulations have been conducted to reveal the alleviation mechanism of the concave chamber. Two kinds of alleviation mechanism have been obtained which are separately: the shock wave diffraction and the shock wave breaking up. These mechanism can efficiently alleviate the energy convergence of shock waves. The research results can be used as a theoretical basis for the chamber design to avoid the destruction under severe knock.

ID ELECTRICITY MARKETS; POWER; FLEXIBILITY; EQUILIBRIA; RIGHTS
AB Rising penetrations of variable renewable generation in electric power systems can raise operational challenges. One is that renewables can increase the need for dispatchable generation with fast-ramping capabilities. This can be costly, because in many instances flexible generators can be more expensive than baseload units that have slower ramping capabilities. If ramping capacity is not available, renewable curtailment may be needed. An alternate solution to this need for ramping is to use energy storage.
   A question that this raises is how renewable and conventional generators and energy storage would interact in a market environment, and whether certain asset-ownership structures would result in more efficient coordination. To this end, this paper presents a multi-period market-equilibrium model of interactions between these different types of market agents. The impacts on renewable integration of conventional generators having limited ramping capabilities are studied through an illustrative case study. We also examine a variety of structures for the participation of energy storage in the market. We find that co-ownership and co-operation of renewable generators and energy storage brings about the best results from the perspective of alleviating market inefficiencies. Having energy storage directly controlled by the market operator or participating as an independent profit-maximizing firm is less efficient.

AB Variable pressure humidification technology is proposed for seawater desalination through evaporation at pressure(s) less than atmospheric and subsequent condensation. Two sub-atmospheric humidification processes (process-I and II) utilizing solar heat are proposed and assessed theoretically. The desalinated water production rate, gained output ratio and an economical comparison between processes are made subject to similar operating conditions. It is deduced that, under similar conditions, pressure reduction from 0.9 bars to 0.1 bars leads to approximately 50% increase in the desalinated water production rate in each of the proposed processes. For humidifier pressures less than atmospheric pressure, the maximum gained output ratio for process-II is higher by 139.13% than that of process-I while the distilled water production rate is lower by 5.71%. Unlike other variable pressure desalination processes, there is no need to use compressor when the vacuum pump is present. To have a comprehensive study of the proposed systems and determine their feasibilities, a cost analysis is conducted. The result of cost analysis indicates that the total cost per liter of distilled water in two proposed process are 0.034 and 0.041 US $/4., respectively. This value is estimated to be reduced to 0.002 US $/L for an industrial scale variable pressure humidification-dehumidification plant.

AB Babesiosis is a tick-borne disease that occurs worldwide with the most recognized Babesia species that infect dogs being Babesia canis, B. vogeli, B. rossi and B. gibsoni. While B. vogeli is reported in dogs worldwide, clinical and laboratory data on infections is based on reports of naturally infected dogs. To provide reliable data on the clinical and laboratory abnormalities associated with acute and more chronic infections in healthy dogs free of other tick-borne diseases, we experimentally infected dogs with a Chinese strain of B. vogeli. All of the six infected Beagles, three of which were splenectomized, became infected with B. vogeli detected in blood smears taken the day following infection and the organism detected by FRET-qPCRs in most blood samples (77/86; 90%) collected about every 4 days until the end of the experiment on day 95. All the infected dogs showed fever, partial anorexia and malaise that was more severe in the splenectomized dogs that did not gain weight for three weeks in the period after initial infection. Regenerative anemia, thrombocytopenia and decreased white blood cell counts were seen in all dogs but were more severe in the splenectomized dogs, of which two had life threatening infections and had to be removed from the study for treatment. Following re-infection on day 66, none of the dogs showed clinical signs and copy numbers did not change significantly although all the dogs were negative by FRET-qPCR on at least some of the subsequent sampling days. Laboratory values in the non-splenectomized dogs were relatively unchanged while in the splenectomized dog there was a temporary small increase in the platelet and white blood cell counts and a temporary slight worsening of the anemia. In summary, our study shows dogs experimentally infected with a B. vogeli strain from China develop only mild clinical signs that are followed by asymptomatic infections that can last for least 95 days. In splenectomized dogs, however, severe life threatening signs may develop.

AB The immature immune system of cats in their paediatric age (i.e., first six months of life) favours the establishment of infectious respiratory tract diseases mainly caused by well recognized viruses and bacteria species. Conversely, lungworm infections are less investigated during respiratory disorders in kittens. In the last decade, Troglostrongylus brevior has been found affecting the respiratory tract of cats, along with the better-known Aelurostrongylus abstrusus. Given the scant data available on the epidemiology of feline troglostrongylosis, faecal samples from 575 domestic animals living in three Italian municipalities (i.e., Bad, Messina and Siena) were screened for lungworm infection by Baermann and molecular tecniques. Animals were grouped according to their age as 6 months (i.e., paediatric patients), 6-24 months, or > 24 months. Paediatric cats were further sub-divided in infant (2-6 weeks), weanling (6-12 weeks) and juvenile (3-6 months). Of the 575 animals tested, 241 (42.0%) were younger than 6 months, 188 (33%) were 6 -24-month-old and 146 (25%) were older than 24 months. Lungworm infection was diagnosed in 84 (14.6%) of the examined cats. Of the 49 (20.3%) paediatric animals positive for lungworms, T. brevior was the nematode species most frequently diagnosed (n = 44; 89.8%), followed by A. abstrusus (n = 2; 4.1%), and three cats (6.1%) were co-infected by both species. The diagnosis of T. brevior infection was significantly associated with animals aging <= 6 months (18.2%; P < 0.01) than elder cats. Indeed, the prevalence of infection by T. brevior decreased in animals aging 6-24 months (3.2%) being not detected in cats older than two years. Results of this study indicate that paediatric cats are at higher risk of T. brevior infection compared to adults (P < 0.01).

AB In this study a relatively large and open top aquarium was designed, constructed and introduced as a suitable habitat for nutrition, growth and development as well as for egg laying and breeding of Galba truncatula under laboratory conditions. The soil and water used in the aquarium were collected from the locality in which the snails were collected. The aquarium was placed in a laboratory with temperature of 18-32 degrees C and relative humidity of 22-37% respectively, according to the season. The artificial light was controlled by a light timer, giving 12 h of light and 12 h of darkness. The snails were fed with dried lettuce leaves, Cyperus alternifolius (aquatic plant), Spirulina (algae), Orthotrichum rupestre (moss) and cuttlebone (a supplementary source of calcium). Approximately five weeks after the start of study, there was evidence of reproduction and success in rearing of G. truncatula by the appearance of eggs and small snails (0.1-0.5 mm) in the aquarium. In conclusion, large scale laboratory rearing of G. truncatula is a feasible task. The method may be improved by balancing the temperature and relative humidity as well as by optimizing the soil type, the water quality and the type of food.

ID IDIOPATHIC EOSINOPHILIC MENINGOENCEPHALITIS; DISSEMINATED PROTOTHECOSIS;
   CANINE SPIROCERCOSIS; DOGS; INFECTION
AB Spirocerca lupi is a nematode infecting dogs mostly in tropical and subtropical areas. Although its typical target is the esophageal wall, aberrant migration is not uncommon, including migration of unknown incidence into the spinal cord. While successful treatment of intraspinal S. lupi (ISSL) infection depends on early diagnosis, tools for definitive ante-mortem diagnosis are unavailable. We therefore aimed at characterizing clinical signs and clinical pathology findings of ISSL in dogs.
   For that, we analyzed medical records of dogs hospitalized in 2005-2016 presenting with neurological signs consistent with ISSL, which were diagnosed definitively post-mortem. Retrieved information included signalment, medical history, chief complaint, physical and neurological evaluation, neuroanatomical localization at presentation, clinical pathology, imaging findings, treatment, outcome and post-mortem findings. Ten midsize to large breed dogs were included, 7 of which had received prophylactic treatment. In all 10 dogs, onset was acute and neurological deterioration until presentation (2 h-6 d) was fast. Neurological examination localized the lesions within the spinal cord and paresis or paralysis was asymmetric in all dogs. Spinal pain was documented in 9/10 dogs. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis was abnormal in all dogs and was characterized by pleocytosis in 8/10, whereas cytology revealed the presence of eosinophils in all dogs. Advanced imaging excluded spinal cord compression in all dogs tested. Post-mortem examination detected spinal cord migration tract in all cases. Nematodes were found in the spinal cord parenchyma (8/10) or adjacent to it (2/10) in all dogs. A larva was found in the subarachnoid space of one dog and an adult nematode in the thoracic intervertebral artery of another. Esophageal nodules were found in 5/10 dogs.
   These findings suggest that the combination of sudden onset of acute asymmetric paresis accompanied by pain, presence of eosinophils in the CSF and lack of compressive lesion may serve as sufficient evidence for tentative diagnosis of ISSL in endemic areas.

AB The distribution of Thelazia callipaeda, commonly known as "oriental eyeworm", has been considered for a long time to be confined to the former soviet Republics and Asia where the nematode causes infections in domestic and wild carnivores, rabbits and sometimes humans. However, since 2000, thelaziosis has been diagnosed in dogs and sometimes in cats from a growing number of European countries, including France. In 2006, a survey demonstrated that many autochthonous cases of canine thelaziosis were present in the department of Dordogne (southwestern France) in three hyperenzootic counties where strawberry production was predominant. The objective of the present study was to obtain an updated evaluation of the enzootic occurrence of T. callipaeda in France. In April 2016, an electronic questionnaire was sent to 1670 veterinary clinics from 24 French departments of southwestern France. Among 279 responses, 97 veterinary clinics reported cases of canine thelaziosis during the last 12 months. Most of them (72/97, 74.2%) reported a limited number of cases. Two veterinary clinics in previously-identified hyperenzootic counties of Dordogne reported the higher incidence (50 and 68 new cases annually). Noteworthly, two clinics located in another department (Landes) also reported many autochthonous cases (30 cases annually) demonstrating the existence of new enzootic foci. The present investigation confirmed that Dordogne is still an enzootic area of ocular thelaziosis and that the disease is spreading in new areas of southwestern France since a decade.

AB Visceral leishmaniosis (VL) is a multisystem disease that affects domestic dogs and can have several clinical manifestations, including some rare reports of neurological clinical signs, or it may remain asymptomatic, depending on the individual immune response against the Leishmania parasite. VL involves immune system sensors, such as the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), that are related to innate immunity and inflammation. Previously, we have reported the presence of brain inflammation in infected dogs. Here, we investigated the gene expression profile of TLRs 1-10 in the brain and the spleen of infected dogs, along with the production of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-1 beta and IL-6) with the aim of explaining the origin of brain inflammation. The gene expression of TLRs has varied according to the tissue evaluated. In the brain, TLR-4 was only up-regulated in a small subpopulation of infected dogs, while in the spleen, we detected an increase in TLR-5 and TLR-9 transcripts, as well as a reduction in TLRs 2-4 and TLR-10. All cytokines except IL-6 were detected in infected dogs. Moreover, we detected Leishmania DNA in all infected dogs in both tissues evaluated. In the histopathological analysis, we observed a predominance of lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate, mainly in leptomeninges and choroid plexuses, ranging from mild to intense. This study provides the first insight into the TLRs profile in the brain and the spleen during canine VL and provides support to confirm the involvement of sensors of the innate immune system sensors against L. infantum parasites.

AB Phlebotomine sand flies (Diptera, Psychodidae) are vectors of Leishmania spp., among which Leishmania infantum is recognized as the main agent of human and canine leishmaniosis (CanL) in the Mediterranean area. In this study, females of Phlebotomus spp. (P. perniciosus, P. neglectus and P. papatasi) and Sergentomyia minuta were collected in a dog shelter of southern Italy, where CanL is endemic, and examined for Leishmania DNA. In total, 32 out of 56 of Phlebotomus spp. insects (57.1%) were found positive for L. infantum DNA by quantitative PCR (qPCR), with a mean parasite load of 1.9 x 10(3) promastigotes/ml among 23 positive P. perniciosus and 2.1 x 10(3) promastigotes/ml among five positive P. neglectus. Four P. papatasi, a species known to be refractory to L. infantum development, were also found positive. Among 216 S. minuta specimens examined, 25 (11.6%) scored positive for Leishmania tarentolae by conventional nested PCR; two (16.7%) of them were also positive for lizard blood, which is in agreement with the feeding preference of this phlebotomine species. Nine S. minuta (4.2%) were positive for L. infantum by qPCR, with a mean parasite load of 1.62 x 10(2) promastigotes/ml. The detection of L. infantum DNA in S. minuta may suggest that this species could acquire the protozoan, occasionally feeding on infected dogs. Further investigations need to clarify the potential role that S. minuta may have in the transmission of L. infantum to receptive mammal hosts.

AB Toxoplasma gondii is an apicomplexan parasite that in Europe is genetically characterized by three main clonal genotypes, with a lesser prevalence of atypical patterns. Data on the genotypes of T. gondii circulating both in wildlife and livestock in Northern Italy are scarce. In the present study skeletal muscle samples of cattle (Bos taurus), swine (Sus scrofa domesticus), fox (Vulpes vulpes), roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) and wild boar (Sus scrofa) were genotyped by using a nested PCR of 6 loci (alt.SAG2, GRAB, 5'SAG2, BTUB, C22-8 and SAG1) and in silico RFLP. High prevalence of genotype I and non-canonical genotypes were observed in this study, with some differences in the population structure of the parasite between livestock and wildlife. Genetic variability of T. gondii in Europe could be more variable than previously thought, with possible implication for public health.

AB Anthelmintic treatments to ewes around lambing time, often with long acting products, have become common practice on UK sheep farms, but these treatments have also been shown to be highly selective for anthelmintic resistance in New Zealand and Australia, with field data supported by modelling results. The purpose of this study was to determine (1) the effect of treating or withholding anthelmintic treatments and (2) the effect of treatment of ewes with a persistent or non-persistent anthelmintic, on early infection in lambs in the UK. Faecal egg count data for 10-16 weeks old lambs collected over a three year period (2012-2014) was analysed. Samples were grouped according to whether the ewes on the farm had or had not been treated with an anthelmintic at lambing. For both analyses, data for early infection were analysed by generalised linear mixed model. There was no effect of withholding or treating ewes on subsequent early infection in lambs. In addition, there was no effect of region, farm type or management type on the faecal egg counts. There was, however an effect of year, with lambs having lower counts in 2014 than in 2012 and an interaction between year and ewe treatment, with data suggesting lower infection levels over time for those farms withholding anthelmintic treatments altogether. There was no effect of drug type on early infection in lambs nor region, farm type or treatment on the lamb faecal egg counts. However, there was an effect of year and an interaction between year and drug type with lower egg count over time with the short acting drugs. Our study supports data generated by other researchers suggesting that the practice of treating ewes at lambing to reduce contamination on pasture and minimise subsequent disease may not in fact always result in lower levels of infection in lambs. The study also demonstrated no significant benefit in early infection in lambs when ewes were treated with long acting compared to short acting anthelmintics. This provides further evidence to support the potential benefits of a more targeted approach to anthelmintic treatment on sheep farms.

AB Livestock trypanosomoses, caused by three species of the Trypanozoon subgenus, Trypanosome brucei brucei, T. evansi and T. equiperdum are widely distributed and limit animal production throughout the world. The infectivity and virulence of clones derived from Trypanosome evansi and Trypanosome equiperdum Venezuelan strains were compared in an in vivo mouse model. Primary infectivity and virulence determinants such as survival rates, parasitemia levels, PCV, and changes in body weight and survival rates were monitored for up to 32 days. The T. equiperdum strain was the most virulent, with 100% mortality in mice, with the highest parasitemia levels (7.0 x 10(7) Tryps/ml) and loss of physical condition. The T. evansi strains induced 100% and 20% fatality in mice. Our results show that the homogeneous parasite populations maintain the virulent phenotype of the original T. equiperdum and T. evansi stocks. This is the first comparative study of infectivity and virulence determinants among clonal populations of T. equiperdum and T. evansi.

AB The Northern bobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus) is an economically significant gamebird that has experienced a decline throughout the Rolling Plains ecoregion of Texas. Recent surveys of this area have revealed a high prevalence in eyeworm (Oxyspirura petrowi) and caecal worm (Aulonocephalus pennula) infection that may contribute to this decline. In order to further understand these parasites role in bobwhite populations, a time-, and cost-effective multiplex quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay was developed in this study to detect eyeworm and caecal worm infection through egg detection using the ITS2 and COX1 gene region, respectively. Method validation for the qPCR involved bobwhite fecal samples from the Rolling Plains as well as samples spiked with eyeworm, caecal worm, and bobwhite DNA. Results showed an observed increasing qPCR parasite egg detection with increasing worm burdens. Future uses with this assay can also provide insight to seasonal parasite infection and the life cycles of eyeworm and caecal worm.

AB Although various studies have provided novel insights into how to best design, analyze and interpret a fecal egg count reduction test (FECRT), it is still not straightforward to provide guidance that allows improving both the standardization and the analytical performance of the FECRT across a variety of both animal and nematode species. For example, it has been suggested to recommend a minimum number of eggs to be counted under the microscope (not eggs per gram of feces), but we lack the evidence to recommend any number of eggs that would allow a reliable assessment of drug efficacy. Other aspects that need further research are the methodology of calculating uncertainty intervals (UIs; confidence intervals in case of frequentist methods and credible intervals in case of Bayesian methods) and the criteria of classifying drug efficacy into 'normal', 'suspected' and 'reduced'. The aim of this study is to provide complementary insights into the current knowledge, and to ultimately provide guidance in the development of new standardized guidelines for the FECRT. First, data were generated using a simulation in which the 'true' drug efficacy (TDE) was evaluated by the FECRT under varying scenarios of sample size, analytic sensitivity of the diagnostic technique, and level of both intensity and aggregation of egg excretion. Second, the obtained data were analyzed with the aim (i) to verify which classification criteria allow for reliable detection of reduced drug efficacy, (ii) to identify the UI methodology that yields the most reliable assessment of drug efficacy (coverage of TDE) and detection of reduced drug efficacy, and (iii) to determine the required sample size and number of eggs counted under the microscope that optimizes the detection of reduced efficacy. Our results confirm that the currently recommended criteria for classifying drug efficacy are the most appropriate. Additionally, the UI methodologies we tested varied in coverage and ability to detect reduced drug efficacy, thus a combination of UI methodologies is recommended to assess the uncertainty across all scenarios of drug efficacy estimates. Finally, based on our model estimates we were able to determine the required number of eggs to count for each sample size, enabling investigators to optimize the probability of correctly classifying a theoretical TDE while minimizing both financial and technical resources.

AB Eimeria maxima 14-3-3 (Em14-3-3) open reading frame (ORF) which consisted of 861 bp encoding a protein of 286 amino acids was successfully amplified and sequenced. Subsequently, the Em14-3-3 ORF was subcloned into pET-32a (+) and pVAX1, respectively. RT-PCR and immunoblot analyses confirmed that the target gene was successfully transcribed and expressed in vivo. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that Em14-3-3 was expressed in both the sporozoites and merozoites. The animal experiments demonstrated that both rEm14-3-3 and pVAX1-14-3-3 could clearly alleviate jejunum lesions and body weight loss. The Em14-3-3 vaccines could increase oocyst decrease ratio, as well as produce an anticoccidial index of more than 165. The percentages of CD4(+) in both the Em14-3-3 immunized groups were much higher, when compared with those of PBS, pET32a (+), and pVAX1 controls (P < 0.05). Similarly, the anti-Em14-3-3 antibody titers of both rEm14-3-3 and pVAX1-14-3-3 immunized groups showed higher levels compared with those of PBS, pET32a (+), and pVAX1 controls (P < 0.05). The IFN-gamma and tumor growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) levels showed significant increments in the rEm14-3-3 and pVAX1-14-3-3 immunized groups, when compared with those in the negative controls (P < 0.05). These results demonstrated that Em14-3-3 could be used as a promising antigen candidate for developing vaccines against E. maxima.

AB Zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis (ZVL) is a parasitic disease affecting dogs and humans, which is transmitted by female sandflies. Over the last decade, disease prevalence has increased fivefold in parts of southern Europe, where an estimated 2.5 million dogs are infected. This increase is mainly due to an expansion in sandfly distribution due to climate change and to the greater numbers of dogs travelling among European countries. To combat the spread of ZVL in Europe, international guidelines have been drawn up that describe strategies to prevent, control and monitor the disease. To investigate whether these strategies are being implemented in the field, we conducted an online survey among veterinarians in Spain (endemic for ZVL) and France (south: emerging; north: non-endemic). Of the 889 respondents, 459 veterinarians completed all questions. Although 60% of all veterinarians were aware of the current ZVL increase in Europe, 70% were not familiar with any guidelines for controlling the disease. Most of their preventive and treatment actions were, however, in line with intervention strategies recommended by the guidelines. From the veterinarians in this survey, 76% had received no reports regarding confirmed cases of canine leishmaniosis (CanL) or human visceral leishmaniasis in their region or country. The fact that 88% of confirmed cases of clinical CanL were not reported suggests inadequate disease monitoring and evaluation. We therefore recommend that an easy-to-use and accessible international online network be developed, where both veterinarians and physicians can report confirmed cases of leishmaniosis in dogs and humans. This is crucial for monitoring, controlling and preventing the further spread of ZVL in Europe at regional, national and international level.

ID AMERICAN PERSPECTIVE
AB Veterinary education in Portugal began in 1830, but individualised teaching of parasitology started in 1911 at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Lisbon (FMV-ULisboa). Parasitology and Parasitic Diseases were taught in the 3rd and 4th years of the veterinary course, respectively. In 2007/2008, a new curriculum was implemented as a consequence of the Bologna Process (BP), with Parasitology converted into "Parasitology I" (General Parasitology, Arthropods and Protozoology) and "Parasitology II" (Helminthology), being taught in the 1st and 2nd semesters of the 2nd year of the course, respectively. "Parasitic Diseases" became a one-semester subject in the 4th year. BP was intended to harmonise university courses, foster mobility and cooperation among European Universities, but instead there have been major challenges in reducing student contact and an erosion of Parasitology I and II as basic subjects, which were moved to 2nd year. In spite of these changes, the way subjects have been taught since then shows that veterinary students are satisfied with Parasitology; academic success ranges from 70% to 90%; the number of Master and PhD theses in Parasitology has increased; and students share their research results in classes and at conferences in our faculty and abroad. This shows how research and teaching of Veterinary Parasitology are tightly inter-linked and critical, presenting an opportunity to motivate future students to study Parasitology and Parasitic Diseases in such a challenging tertiary education environment in Portugal.

AB This guideline is intended as an aid in the design, implementation and interpretation of studies for the assessment of drug efficacy against Eimeria in cattle and sheep, Cystoisospora in pigs and dogs, and Cryptosporidium in cattle. It deals with the most important aspects of how to conduct both experimental and field studies for dose determination, dose confirmation and assessment of field effectiveness. Also, guidance on the selection of animals, diagnostic techniques, statistical evaluation and methods for the preparation, maintenance and use of parasites is provided. The specific management conditions that may influence the course of natural infections and consequently determine treatment schemes are mentioned and suggestions for best practice in sampling and evaluation of data prior to conducting of efficacy studies are given. The guideline is also intended to assist investigators in carrying out specific studies, provide relevant information for registration authorities involved in the decision-making process, assist in the approval of anticoccidial drugs in the target species, and facilitate the world-wide adoption of standard procedures. Although currently not implemented, issues of drug resistance testing and alternative methods for drug testing are also discussed as future issues in drug testing against mammalian coccidia.

AB The discovery that plant secondary compounds, including proanthocyanidins (PAC), suppress gastrointestinal nematode (GIN) infection has provided promise for alternative methods of GIN control in small ruminants. This investigation is the first to examine the anthelmintic potential of cranberry vine (CV) against the GIN Haemonchus contortus. The purpose of this study was to explore the anti-parasitic activity of CV in the form of a specific organic proanthocyanidin extract (CV-PAC) and an aqueous extract (CV-AqE) containing PAC and other compounds. In vitro egg hatching, first (L1) and third (L3) stage larval and adult worm motility and L3 exsheathment were evaluated after a 24-h incubation with CV products. In addition, CV treated worms were observed via scanning electron microscopy, and a preliminary investigation of the efficacy of CV powder against an experimental infection of H. contortus was conducted. The in vivo effect on an experimental infection was determined by administering 21.1 g CV powder to lambs (n = 9 per group) for three consecutive days, and collecting fecal egg count data for four weeks post -treatment. The effect of CV-PAC on egg hatching, L3 motility and exsheathment was limited. However, a substantial effect was observed on motility of post-hatch Ll (EC50 0.3 mg PAC/mL) and adults (EC50 0.2 mg PAC/mL). The CV-AqE showed more effect on egg hatching (EC50 5.3 mg/mL containing 0.6 mg PAC/mL) as well as impacting motility of Ll (EC50 1.5 mg/mL with 0.2 mg PAC/mL) and adults (EC50 3.4 mg/mL with 0.4 mg PAC/mL), but like CV-PAC, did not substantially effect L3 motility or exsheathment. Scanning electron microscopy revealed an accumulation of aggregate on the cuticle around the buccal area of adult worms incubated in CV-AqE and CV-PAC. In the preliminary in vivo study, there was a significant effect of treatment over time (p = .04), although differences in individual weeks were not significant. In summary, both extracts inhibited motility of Ll and adult worms. The higher efficacy of CV-AqE than CV-PAC at levels that contained the same concentrations of PAC tested alone, suggest that other secondary compounds in the CV-AqE contributed to the observed effects on the parasites. This first study of the in vitro and in vivo effects of CV suggest that this readily available plant product may have utility in integrated control of H. contortus and support the need for additional testing to provide further information.

AB Radiation-induced interface traps are the essential defects affecting the reliability of microelectronic devices, and it is generally agreed that protons play a key role in the reaction that generates the traps. We thus perform first-principles calculations to investigate the reactions that possibly release protons in amorphous SiO2 (a-SiO2). Two fundamental mechanisms are explored, namely the dissociation of hydrogen molecules at positive oxygen vacancies and the dissociation of hydrogenated defects. The calculations show that there are high energy barriers for the singly hydrogenated vacancies to generate protons, and that the barrier for the doubly hydrogenated vacancy is relatively low. The calculations also show that the dissociation of hydrogen molecule at the dimer configuration has a lower energy barrier and a more stable product than the dissociation at the puckered configuration. The energy barrier of the dissociation at the dimer configuration can be as low as 0.58 eV, which ensures that the reaction can take place quickly at room temperature. The details of the reactions are investigated at the atomic scale to provide a microscopic insight into proton release in a-SiO2.

AB The relative entropic contributions of correlated vs. uncorrelated Si-O bond length and Si-O-Si bond angle distributions in the corner-shared tetrahedral network of vitreous silica are estimated semi-quantitatively using the concept of differential entropy. The results suggest that a positively correlated Si-O vs. Si-O-Si distribution will be entropically stabilized in a glass structure over a negatively correlated distribution, which is typical of crystalline polymorphs of silica. This hypothesis lends support to the recent experimental observation of a positively correlated joint distribution of Si-O distances and Si-O-Si angles in vitreous silica by O-17 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. On the other hand, an estimation of the relative effect of these distributions on the ring strain energy suggests that the glass structure avoids a random or uncorrelated joint distribution of these structural parameters as in a continuous random network, due to the high strain energy associated with such a distribution.

AB Glass materials have been applied as insulators during hot extrusion of titanium- and nickel-based alloys to reduce the friction and thermal conduction in the Ugine-Sejournet process. In this research, parallel plate viscometry (PPV) and rotational viscometry (RV) tests were carried out to characterize the viscosity of glass materials such as lead-borate, potassium-lead-silicate, and potassium-sodium-lead-silicate, quantitatively. Herein, we propose a new equation that can be used to predict an extensive range of viscosities from the softening to the melting point. This equation demonstrates more accurate predictions compared with the conventional Vogel-Fulcher-Tamman (VFT), the Avramov&Milchev (AM) and the Mauro-Yue-Ellison-Gupta-Allan (MYEGA) equations.

AB In this work, a controlled uni-directional heat flow was realized during the bulk metallic glasses preparation by using a vertical Bridgman solidification apparatus. Fully amorphous Zr41.2Ti13.8Cu12.5Ni10Be22.5 bulk metallic glass specimens were prepared. The obvious difference in hardness between the cross and longitudinal sections of the as-prepared Zr41.2Ti13.8Cu12.5Ni10Be22.5 bulk metallic glass specimens was identified, indicating strong mechanical anisotropy. The observed anisotropy can be ascribed to the uni-directional heat flow during the process of Bridgman solidification. The mechanical anisotropy may be explained by the free volume theory.

Density of the glasses increased and molar volume decreased up to x = 0.3 and reversed their trends for x > 0.3. The glass transition temperature is increased up to x = 0.30 and decreased for x > 0.3. Changes in density, molar volume and glass transition temperature around x = 0.3 may be ascribed to structural/topological modifications occurring in the glasses. Polaron parameters have been determined. Thermal stability is found to increase with increasing x. Activation energy for dc conduction at high temperature has been determined by applying Mott's small polaron hopping model. Conductivity and activation energy were found to pass through minimum and maximum respectively for x around 0.30, which may be due to a changeover of conduction mechanism from predominantly ionic regime to electronic regime. This transition can be attributed to the interaction between electrons and alkali ions. This result is of significance both scientifically and technologically. Mott's variable range hopping model has been employed to understand conductivity at low temperature for the present glasses.

AB Liu Tungsheng (1917-2008) resumed his scientific career and became actively involved on the international stage in the field of Quaternary Sciences after 1982, at the age of 65, following Deng Xiaoping's 'Reform and Open Up' policy, after his first international publication of China loess research published in 1950s. Though his best known contribution to Quaternary research is his pioneering study of the extensive loess deposits of China, several other important scientific contributions are less widely known, as they were published in Chinese. By studying about 400 well-preserved fieldwork notebooks left by Liu Tungsheng, as well as many biographical and personal photographic collections, we have mapped his remarkable life during his 91-year journey and the contributions to geoscience. From a historical point of view, Liu Tungsheng created a unique chapter in the history of modern geological science in China in his role as a geologist emerging from a traditional Chinese cultural background who became a star on the international scientific stage.

AB The terrestrial mollusk fossils found in Chinese loess strata have been studied for over one hundred years. However, the greatest progress in these studies has been made only in the last two decades. In this paper, we review the advancements, advantages and limitations of terrestrial mollusk studies in Chinese loess deposits. Improvements in research methods and approaches have allowed the extraction of more detailed paleoenvironmental and paleoclimatic information from mollusk assemblages. The broadened research scope and content have yielded many new findings and results. The mollusk record has thus become one of the most important proxies in the paleoenvironmental and paleoclimatic reconstruction of loess-paleosol sequences in China. The greatest progress in the studies of terrestrial mollusks in Chinese loess sequences can be summarized as follows: (1) modern mollusk assemblages can be classified into four ecotypes, based on their temperature and humidity requirements, including eurytopic, semi-aridiphilous and sub-humidiphilous, cold-aridiphilous, and thermo-humidiphilous types; (2) Quaternary mollusk assemblages can be modified into the following three ecological types: glacial loess, interglacial paleosol, and interstadial weakly-developed paleosol assemblages; (3) mollusk records successfully reveal long-term climatic and environmental changes reflective of the history of East Asian monsoonal variations since the Late Cenozoic, and the succession of mollusk species also indicate short-term environmental changes such as millennial climate variability during Last Glacial Maximum and unstable climatic fluctuations during glacial and interglacial periods; and (4) more recently, new analytical approaches have offered increased research potential in areas such as paleotemperature reconstruction using the isotopic compositions of modern and fossil mollusk shells, combined with higher accuracy C-14 dating of Quaternary loess deposits, which will greatly improve future loess paleoenvironrnental research.

AB This study reports hydrogen isotopic records from the central Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) over the past 250 ka. After eliminating the influence of ice and local temperatures, the delta D-wax records extracted from two loess sites at Xifeng and Luochuan can be taken to represent arid/humid alternations in the hydrological environment in this marginal Asian Summer Monsoon (ASM) region; they also contain integrated information on summer precipitation patterns and the corresponding responses to these changes by predominant vegetation cover types. These arid/humid alternations show 100 ka, 40 ka and 20 ka cycles. An increase in precipitation in association with an enhanced summer monsoon has historically been taken to be the major factor driving a humid environment in the central CLP. However, hydroclimatic changes in delta D-wax records differ for the central CLP, central China and southern China. Over a 20 ka cycle, the influence of solar insolation on hydroclimatic changes can be shown to be consistent throughout the central CLP. However, changes in the relative location of the land and sea may have caused different hydroclimatic responses between southern China and the central CLP on a glacial-interglacial scale. The hydroclimatic variability in the central CLP would suggest that an enhanced summer monsoon due to climatic warming is the key to understanding decreased drought degree in this marginal monsoonal region.

AB The Pliocene epoch (5.3-2.6 Ma) is the most recent geological interval in which atmospheric CO2 levels were similar to those of the present day (similar to 400 ppmv). This epoch is therefore considered to be the best ancient analog for predicting a future anthropogenic greenhouse world. In order to determine the response of the East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM) rainbelt during Pliocene warmth, a 71.9 m-thick aeolian 'red clay' sequence at Pianguan was investigated. Rock magnetic experiments suggest that magnetite of pseudo-single domain size is the dominant remanence carrier in the 'red clay' sequence. Magnetostratigraphic data, constrained by lithos-tratigraphy, show that the polarity zones of the 'red clay' section correlate with those between subchrons C2An.2r and C3An.2n of the geomagnetic polarity time scale (GPTS), yielding an age range of 6.9-2.9 Ma. The 'red clay' deposits exhibit enhanced weathering intensity over two time intervals, namely 5.23-4.3 Ma and 3.7-2.9 Ma, as evidenced by their well-developed pedogenic characteristics, as well as their high free to total Fe2O3 ratios and high redness (a*) values, which in turn indicate an increased summer monsoon intensity during most of the Pliocene. Furthermore, the pedogenic characteristics of the well-weathered Pliocene soils were compared with those of paleosol unit S-5 (one of the best-developed soil units found in Pleistocene loess) from the Yulin, Luochuan and Lantian sections, which constitute a north-south transect across the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP). The Pliocene soils at Pianguan show a pedogenic development similar to the S-5 (similar to 0.5 Ma) at Luochuan in the central Plateau, which is located some 3.7 degrees latitude south of Pianguan, but this development is much stronger than that observed at Yulin in the north, and weaker than that seen at Lantian in the south. This may imply a more northerly penetration (similar to 400 km) of the monsoon rainbelt during Pliocene warmth compared with the Pleistocene interglacial period (similar to 0.5 Ma ago), supporting the prediction that the EASM rainbelt shifts northward in a warmer world. In addition, our results show that Pliocene warmth was unlikely to have been characterized by a permanent El Nino-like state, but was possibly influenced by a La Nina-like state.

AB Loess deposits in Xinjiang, northwestern China are ideal archives for past environmental changes in the Westerlies-dominated central Asia. Among previous luminescence dating studies of loess in Xinjiang, few have attempted to systematically investigate the methodological aspects. In this study, we report results of a multiple procedure luminescence dating of the Zeketai loess section in the Ili Basin, central Xinjiang. Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) and post-infrared infrared stimulated luminescence (pIRIR) signals were used for quartz and polymineral grains of different sizes. The pIRIR ages obtained with two protocols agree well with each other and constrain the loess deposition between 50 ka and 88 ka. The OSL ages of fine-grained quartz are in stratigraphic order and range from 37 ka to 61 ka, but are 30% younger than the pIRIR295 ages of both fine and medium grained polyminerals. Although the causes of the discrepancy between the ages derived from different luminescence dating protocols are still to be understood, we stress that the quartz OSL ages of loess in this region are likely to be underestimated, especially for samples older than 40 ka. The polymineral or potassium feldspar pIRIR signal is recommended for dating loess in the Ili Basin, at least as an internal check.

AB Loess deposits and deserts are regarded as coupled geological systems and loess deposits on the periphery of deserts can often be used to reconstruct desert evolution. Previous studies of desert evolution in Asia are mainly concentrated in northwest China and the China Loess Plateau, and little is known about long-term desert evolution in east China. In this study, we selected the Sishijiazi loess section in the Chifeng area in northeast China to study the long-term evolution of the desert in east China. A high-resolution magnetostratigraphy combined with optically stimulated luminescence dating indicated that the age of the section base is approximately 1.02 Ma. The Brunhes-Matuyama boundary is at the depth of 39.8 m in loess unit L8, and the upper boundary of the Jaramillo Subchron is at the depth of 60.8 m in paleosol S10. The results of grain-size analysis indicate a coarsening grain-size trend in the past 1.0 Ma. In addition, based on grain-size variations, the desert evolution in east China since similar to 1.0 Ma can be divided into three stages: stability from 1.0 to 0.8 Ma, desert recession from 0.8 to 0.5 Ma, and gradual expansion since 0.5 Ma. Our results further indicate that the evolution of desert in east China was mainly controlled by changes in global ice volume, and that the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau may have had an additional effect.

AB The stable carbon isotopic composition of organic matter of aeolian silt deposits is regarded as an appropriate proxy index of paleovegetation, especially in the Chinese Loess Plateau in central China. In this study, a loess paleosol sequence in the southeastern Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in northeastern (NE) China, which is located outside the Chinese Loess Plateau, is chosen to reconstruct the vegetation history since similar to 1.08 Ma. Temperature exhibits a threshold value, which determines the growth of C-4 plants in this study area. The organic matter of the samples is derived from two different vegetation types, namely, the mixed C-3 and C-4 plants and the pure C-3 plants. The delta C-13 of the organic matter shows negative values in loess units and higher values in paleosol units. This finding reflects the influence of temperature and summer monsoon intensity on the vegetation dynamics over glacial interglacial cycles. On a longer time scale, the delta C-13 values are higher between similar to 1.1 and similar to 0.9 Ma and after similar to 0.35 Ma, and lower between similar to 0.9 and similar to 0.35 Ma, which may be attributed to a long-term temperature variation. Our analysis shows that regional temperature is the most important limiting factor that forces vegetation changes at the glacial interglacial time scale in NE China.

AB Loess deposits in Xiashu are representative of such deposits in Southeastern China that are mainly distributed in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River valley. These loess-paleosol sequences provide a key archive of past climate change in humid, subtropical regions. However, the ages of the sequences are not well constrained. In this study, the standard quartz single-aliquot regenerative (SAR) dose optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) and K-feldspar post-infrared infrared stimulated luminescence (post-IR IRSL; pIRIR290) methods are used to date two loess sequences in Nanjing region. Our results show that quartz SAR OSL and K-feldspar pIRIR(290) ages are more or less indistinguishable from one another up to similar to 50 ka. Beyond this age, the K-feldspar pIRIR ages increased systematically with deposition depth, agreeing well with the expected ages as far as similar to 200 ka. On the basis of a fully independently-dated timescale, we are therefore able to propose, for the first time, a new age model for the Xiashu Loess deposits accumulated since the penultimate interglacial period. Using our newly obtained luminescence dating ages, we observe a marked difference between the loess accumulation rates in the two sequences, potentially forced by regional depositional processes and loess preservation.

AB A novel and comprehensive computational method, referred to as the eXtended Algebraic Variational Multiscale-Multigrid-Multifractal Method (XAVM(4)), is proposed for large-eddy simulation of the particularly challenging problem of turbulent two-phase flow. The XAVM(4) involves multifractal subgrid-scale modeling as well as a Nitsche-type extended finite element method as an approach for two-phase flow. The application of an advanced structural subgrid-scale modeling approach in conjunction with a sharp representation of the discontinuities at the interface between two bulk fluids promise high-fidelity large-eddy simulation of turbulent two-phase flow. The high potential of the XAVM(4) is demonstrated for large-eddy simulation of turbulent two-phase bubbly channel flow, that is, turbulent channel flow carrying a single large bubble of the size of the channel half-width in this particular application.

AB In this work we develop a set of nonlinear correction equations to enforce a consistent time-implicit emission temperature for the original semi-implicit IMC equations. We present two possible forms of correction equations: one results in a set of non-linear, zero-dimensional, non-negative, explicit correction equations, and the other results in a non-linear, non-negative, Boltzman transport correction equation. The zero-dimensional correction equations adheres to the maximum principle for the material temperature, regardless of frequency-dependence, but does not prevent maximum principle violation in the photon intensity, eventually leading to material overheating. The Boltzman transport correction guarantees adherence to the maximum principle for frequency-independent simulations, at the cost of evaluating a reduced source non-linear Boltzman equation. We present numerical evidence suggesting that the Boltzman transport correction, in its current form, significantly improves time step limitations but does not guarantee adherence to the maximum principle for frequency-dependent simulations.

AB A discrete De Rham complex enables compatible, structure-preserving discretizations for a broad range of partial differential equations problems. Such discretizations can correctly reproduce the physics of interface problems, provided the grid conforms to the interface. However, large deformations, complex geometries, and evolving interfaces makes generation of such grids difficult. We develop and demonstrate two formally equivalent approaches that, for a given background mesh, dynamically construct an interface-conforming discrete De Rham complex. Both approaches start by dividing cut elements into interface-conforming subelements but differ in how they build the finite element basis on these subelements. The first approach discards the existing non-conforming basis of the parent element and replaces it by a dynamic set of degrees of freedom of the same kind. The second approach defines the interface-conforming degrees of freedom on the subelements as superpositions of the basis functions of the parent element. These approaches generalize the Conformal Decomposition Finite Element Method (CDFEM) and the extended finite element method with algebraic constraints (XFEM-AC), respectively, across the De Rham complex.

AB In Hu and Yi (2016) [20], a non-oscillatory k-exact reconstruction method was proposed towards the high-order finite volume methods for steady Euler equations, which successfully demonstrated the high-order behavior in the simulations. However, the degeneracy of the numerical accuracy of the approximate solutions to problems with curved boundary can be observed obviously. In this paper, the issue is resolved by introducing the Non-Uniform Rational B-splines (NURBS) method, i.e., with given discrete description of the computational domain, an approximate NURBS curve is reconstructed to provide quality quadrature information along the curved boundary. The advantages of using NURBS include i). both the numerical accuracy of the approximate solutions and convergence rate of the numerical methods are improved simultaneously, and ii). the NURBS curve generation is independent of other modules of the numerical framework, which makes its application very flexible. It is also shown in the paper that by introducing more elements along the normal direction for the reconstruction patch of the boundary element, significant improvement in the convergence to steady state can be achieved. The numerical examples confirm the above features very well. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB An optimally efficient explicit numerical scheme for solving fluid dynamics equations, or any other parabolic or hyperbolic system of partial differential equations, should allow local regions to advance in time with their own, locally constrained time steps. However, such a scheme can result in violation of the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition, which is manifestly non-local. Although the violations can be considered to be "weak" in a certain sense and the corresponding numerical solution may be stable, such calculation does not guarantee the correct propagation speed for arbitrary waves. We use an experimental fluid dynamics code that allows cubic "patches" of grid cells to step with independent, locally constrained time steps to demonstrate how the CFL condition can be enforced by imposing a constraint on the time steps of neighboring patches. We perform several numerical tests that illustrate errors introduced in the numerical solutions by weak CFL condition violations and show how strict enforcement of the CFL condition eliminates these errors. In all our tests the strict enforcement of the CFL condition does not impose a significant performance penalty. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Mathematical models for flow through porous media typically enjoy the so-called maximum principles, which place bounds on the pressure field. It is highly desirable to preserve these bounds on the pressure field in predictive numerical simulations, that is, one needs to satisfy discrete maximum principles (DMP). Unfortunately, many of the existing formulations for flow through porous media models do not satisfy DMP. This paper presents a robust, scalable numerical formulation based on variational inequalities(VI), to model non-linear flows through heterogeneous, anisotropic porous media without violating DMP. VI is an optimization technique that places bounds on the numerical solutions of partial differential equations. To crystallize the ideas, a modification to Darcy equations by taking into account pressure-dependent viscosity will be discretized using the lowest-order Raviart-Thomas (RT0) and Variational Multi-scale (VMS) finite element formulations. It will be shown that these formulations violate DMP, and, in fact, these violations increase with an increase in anisotropy. It will be shown that the proposed VI-based formulation provides a viable route to enforce DMP. Moreover, it will be shown that the proposed formulation is scalable, and can work with any numerical discretization and weak form. A series of numerical benchmark problems are solved to demonstrate the effects of heterogeneity, anisotropy and non-linearity on DMP violations under the two chosen formulations (RT0 and VMS), and that of non-linearity on solver convergence for the proposed VI-based formulation. Parallel scalability on modern computational platforms will be illustrated through strong-scaling studies, which will prove the efficiency of the proposed formulation in a parallel setting. Algorithmic scalability as the problem size is scaled up will be demonstrated through novel static-scaling studies. The performed static-scaling studies can serve as a guide for users to be able to select an appropriate discretization for a given problem size. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper introduces a new approach to Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) where subgrid-scale (SGS) dissipation is applied proportionally to the degree of local spectral broadening, hence mitigated or deactivated in regions dominated by large-scale and/or laminar vortical motion. The proposed coherent-vorticity preserving(CvP) LES methodology is based on the evaluation of the ratio of the test-filtered to resolved (or grid-filtered) enstrophy, sigma. Values of sigma close to 1 indicate low sub-test-filter turbulent activity, justifying local deactivation of the SGS dissipation. The intensity of the SGS dissipation is progressively increased for sigma < 1 which corresponds to a small-scale spectral broadening. The SGS dissipation is then fully activated in developed turbulence characterized by sigma <= sigma(eq), where the value sigma(eq) is derived assuming a Kolmogorov spectrum. The proposed approach can be applied to any eddy-viscosity model, is algorithmically simple and computationally inexpensive. LES of Taylor-Green vortex breakdown demonstrates that the CvP methodology improves the performance of traditional, non-dynamic dissipative SGS models, capturing the peak of total turbulent kinetic energy dissipation during transition. Similar accuracy is obtained by adopting Germano's dynamic procedure albeit at more than twice the computational overhead. A CvP-LES of a pair of unstable periodic helical vortices is shown to predict accurately the experimentally observed growth rate using coarse resolutions. The ability of the CvP methodology to dynamically sort the coherent, large-scale motion from the smaller, broadband scales during transition is demonstrated via flow visualizations. LES of compressible channel are carried out and show a good match with a reference DNS. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A numerical method using implicit surface representations is proposed to solve the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann equation that arises in mathematical models for the electrostatics of molecules in solvent. The proposed method uses an implicit boundary integral formulation to derive a linear system defined on Cartesian nodes in a narrowband surrounding the closed surface that separates the molecule and the solvent. The needed implicit surface is constructed from the given atomic description of the molecules, by a sequence of standard level set algorithms. A fast multipole method is applied to accelerate the solution of the linear system. A few numerical studies involving some standard test cases are presented and compared to other existing results.

AB Multigrid schemes for high order finite difference methods on summation-by-parts form are studied by comparing the effect of different interpolation operators. By using the standard linear prolongation and restriction operators, the Galerkin condition leads to inaccurate coarse grid discretizations. In this paper, an alternative class of interpolation operators that bypass this issue and preserve the summation-by-parts property on each grid level is considered. Clear improvements of the convergence rate for relevant model problems are achieved. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, a multi-moment finite volume method (FVM) based on block-structured adaptive Cartesian mesh is proposed for simulating incompressible flows. A conservative interpolation scheme following the idea of the constrained interpolation profile (CIP) method is proposed for the prolongation operation of the newly created mesh. A sharp immersed boundary (IB) method is used to model the immersed rigid body. A moving least squares (MLS) interpolation approach is applied for reconstruction of the velocity field around the solid surface. An efficient method for discretization of Laplacian operators on adaptive meshes is proposed. Numerical simulations on several test cases are carried out for validation of the proposed method. For the case of viscous flow past an impulsively started cylinder (Re = 3000, 9500), the computed surface vorticity coincides with the result of the body-fitted method. For the case of a fast pitching NACA 0015 airfoil at moderate Reynolds numbers (Re = 10000, 45000), the predicted drag coefficient ( CD) and lift coefficient (C-L) agree well with other numerical or experimental results. For 2D and 3D simulations of viscous flow past a pitching plate with prescribed motions (Re = 5000, 40000), the predicted C-D, C(L)and C-M (moment coefficient) are in good agreement with those obtained by other numerical methods.

AB We present an algorithm for the numerical calculation of Taylor states in toroidal and toroidal-shell geometries using an analytical framework developed for the solution to the time-harmonic Maxwell equations. Taylor states are a special case of what are known as Beltrami fields, or linear force-free fields. The scheme of this work relies on the generalized Debye source representation of Maxwell fields and an integral representation of Beltrami fields which immediately yields a well-conditioned secondkind integral equation. This integral equation has a unique solution whenever the Beltrami parameter lambda is not a member of a discrete, countable set of resonances which physically correspond to spontaneous symmetry breaking. Several numerical examples relevant to magnetohydrodynamic equilibria calculations are provided. Lastly, our approach easily generalizes to arbitrary geometries, both bounded and unbounded, and of varying genus. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The two-way artificial boundary condition (2wABC) works as pure incidence, pure radiation and as combined incidence/radiation BC. In this work the 2wABC is applied to harmonic linear water waves; its performance is tested against the analytical solution for wave propagation over horizontal sea bottom, standing and partially standing wave as well as wave interference of waves with different periods.

AB This paper investigates the lowest-order weak Galerkin finite element method for solving the Darcy equation on quadrilateral and hybrid meshes consisting of quadrilaterals and triangles. In this approach, the pressure is approximated by constants in element interiors and on edges. The discrete weak gradients of these constant basis functions are specified in local Raviart-Thomas spaces, specifically RT0 for triangles and unmapped RT[0] for quadrilaterals. These discrete weak gradients are used to approximate the classical gradient when solving the Darcy equation. The method produces continuous normal fluxes and is locally mass-conservative, regardless of mesh quality, and has optimal order convergence in pressure, velocity, and normal flux, when the quadrilaterals are asymptotically parallelograms. Implementation is straightforward and results in symmetric positive-definite discrete linear systems. We present numerical experiments and comparisons with other existing methods.

AB A hybrid, design-order sliding mesh algorithm, which uses a control volume finite element method (CVFEM), in conjunctionwith a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) approach at nonconformal interfaces, is outlined in the context of a low-Mach fluid dynamics equation set. This novel hybrid DG approach is also demonstrated to be compatible with a classic edgebased vertex centered (EBVC) scheme. For the CVFEM, element polynomial, P, promotion is used to extend the low-order P = 1CVFEM method to higher-order, i.e., P = 2. An equalorder low-Mach pressure-stabilized methodology, with emphasis on the non-conformal interface boundary condition, is presented. A fully implicitmatrix solver approach that accounts for the full stencil connectivity across the non-conformal interface is employed. Acomplete suite of formal verification studies using the method of manufactured solutions (MMS) is performed to verify the order of accuracy of the underlying methodology. The chosen suite of analytical verification cases range from a simple steady diffusion system to a traveling viscous vortex acrossmixed-order non-conformal interfaces. Results from all verification studies demonstrate either second-or third-order spatial accuracy and, for transient solutions, second-order temporal accuracy. Significant accuracy gains in manufactured solution error norms are noted even with modest promotion of the underlying polynomial order. The paper also demonstrates the CVFEM/DG methodology on two production-like simulation cases that include an inner block subjected to solid rotation, i.e., each of the simulations include a sliding mesh, non-conformal interface. The first production case presented is a turbulent flow past a high-rate-of-rotation cube (Re, 4000; RPM, 3600) on like and mixed-order polynomial interfaces. The final simulation case is a full-scale Vestas V27 225 kW wind turbine (tower and nacelle omitted) in which a hybrid topology, low-order mesh is used. Both production simulations provide confidence in the underlying capability and demonstrate the viability of this hybrid method for deployment towards high-fidelity wind energy validation and analysis.

AB We present an implementation of EAM and FS interatomic potentials, which are widely used in simulating metallic systems, in HOOMD-blue, a software designed to perform classical molecular dynamics simulations using GPU accelerations. We first discuss the details of our implementation and then report extensive benchmark tests. We demonstrate that single-precision floating point operations efficiently implemented on GPUs can produce sufficient accuracy when compared against double-precision codes, as demonstrated in test simulations of calculations of the glass-transition temperature of Cu64.5Zr35.5, and pair correlation function g(r) of liquid Ni3Al. Our code scales well with the size of the simulating system on NVIDIA Tesla M40 and P100 GPUs. Compared with another popular software LAMMPS running on 32 cores of AMD Opteron 6220 processors, the GPU/CPU performance ratio can reach as high as 4.6.

AB This paper extends the multidimensional positive definite advection transport algorithm (MPDATA) to third-order accuracy for temporally and spatially varying flows. This is accomplished by identifying the leading truncation error of the standard second-order MPDATA, performing the Cauchy-Kowalevski procedure to express it in a spatial form and compensating its discrete representation-much in the same way as the standard MPDATA corrects the first-order accurate upwind scheme. The procedure of deriving the spatial form of the truncation error was automated using a computer algebra system. This enables various options in MPDATA to be included straightforwardly in the third-order scheme, thereby minimising the implementation effort in existing code bases. Following the spirit of MPDATA, the error is compensated using the upwind scheme resulting in a sign-preserving algorithm, and the entire scheme can be formulated using only two upwind passes. Established MPDATA enhancements, such as formulation in generalised curvilinear coordinates, the nonoscillatory option or the infinite-gauge variant, carry over to the fully third-order accurate scheme. A manufactured 3D analytic solution is used to verify the theoretical development and its numerical implementation, whereas global tracertransport benchmarks demonstrate benefits for chemistry-transport models fundamental to air quality monitoring, forecasting and control. A series of explicitly-inviscid implicit large-eddy simulations of a convective boundary layer and explicitly-viscid simulations of a double shear layer illustrate advantages of the fully third-order-accurate MPDATA for fluid dynamics applications.

AB In implicit large eddy simulations (ILES) numerical dissipation prevents buildup of small scale energy in a manner similar to the explicit subgrid scale (SGS) models. If spectral methods are used the numerical dissipation is negligible but it can be introduced by applying a low-pass filter in the physical space, resulting in an effective ILES. In the present work we provide a comprehensive analysis of the numerical dissipation produced by different filtering operations in a turbulent channel flow simulated using a non-dissipative, pseudo-spectral Navier-Stokes solver. The amount of numerical dissipation imparted by filtering can be easily adjusted by changing how often a filter is applied. We show that when the additional numerical dissipation is close to the subgrid-scale (SGS) dissipation of an explicit LES the overall accuracy of ILES is also comparable, indicating that periodic filtering can replace explicit SGS models. A new method is proposed, which does not require any prior knowledge of a flow, to determine the filtering period adaptively. Once an optimal filtering period is found, the accuracy of ILES is significantly improved at low implementation complexity and computational cost. The method is general, performing well for different Reynolds numbers, grid resolutions, and filter shapes. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A formulation for soluble surfactant transport in multiphase flows recently presented by Muradoglu and Tryggvason (JCP 274 (2014) 737-757) [17] is adapted to the context of the Level Contour Reconstruction Method, LCRM, (Shin et al. IJNMF 60 (2009) 753-778,[ 8]) which is a hybrid method that combines the advantages of the Front-tracking and Level Set methods. Particularly close attention is paid to the formulation and numerical implementation of the surface gradients of surfactant concentration and surface tension. Various benchmark tests are performed to demonstrate the accuracy of different elements of the algorithm. To verify surfactant mass conservation, values for surfactant diffusion along the interface are compared with the exact solution for the problem of uniform expansion of a sphere. The numerical implementation of the discontinuous boundary condition for the source term in the bulk concentration is compared with the approximate solution. Surface tension forces are tested for Marangoni drop translation. Our numerical results for drop deformation in simple shear are compared with experiments and results from previous simulations. All benchmarking tests compare well with existing data thus providing confidence that the adapted LCRM formulation for surfactant advection and diffusion is accurate and effective in three-dimensional multiphase flows with a structured mesh. We also demonstrate that this approach applies easily to massively parallel simulations. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this study a new spectral iterative method (SIM) based on fractional interpolation is presented for solving nonlinear fractional differential equations (FDEs) involving Caputo derivative. This method is equipped with a pre-algorithm to find the singularity index of solution of the problem. This pre-algorithm gives us a real parameter as the index of the fractional interpolation basis, for which the SIM achieves the highest order of convergence. In comparison with some recent results about the error estimates for fractional approximations, a more accurate convergence rate has been attained. We have also proposed the order of convergence for fractional interpolation error under the L-2-norm. Finally, general error analysis of SIM has been considered. The numerical results clearly demonstrate the capability of the proposed method. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Genetic evidence for a link between DNA replication and glycolysis has been demonstrated a decade ago in Bacillus subtilis, where temperature-sensitive mutations in genes coding for replication proteins could be suppressed by mutations in genes of glycolytic enzymes. Then, a strong influence of dysfunctions of particular enzymes from the central carbon metabolism (CCM) on DNA replication and repair in Escherichia coli was reported. Therefore, we asked if such a link occurs only in bacteria or it is a more general phenomenon. Here, we demonstrate that effects of silencing (provoked by siRNA) of expression of genes coding for proteins involved in DNA replication and repair (primase, DNA polymerase 1, ligase IV, and topoisomerase III beta) on these processes (less efficient entry into the S phase of the cell cycle and decreased level of DNA synthesis) could be suppressed by silencing of specific genes of enzymes from CMM. Silencing of other pairs of replication/repair and CMM genes resulted in enhancement of the negative effects of lower expression levels of replication/repair genes. We suggest that these results may be proposed as a genetic evidence for the link between DNA replication/repair and CMM in human cells, indicating that it is a common biological phenomenon, occurring from bacteria to humans.

AB Increasing amounts of evidence have indicated that non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) have important regulatory potential in various biological processes. However, the contribution of ncRNAs, especially long non-coding RNAs (IncRNAs) to drug induced steatosis remain largely unknown. The aim of this study is to investigate miRNA, IncRNA and mRNA expression profiles and their potential roles in the process of drug induced steatosis. Microarray expression profiles of miRNAs, IncRNAs and mRNAs were determined in dexamethasone treated HepG2 cell as well as control cell. Differential expression, pathway and gene network analyses were developed to identify possible functional RNA molecules in dexamethasone induced steatosis. Compared with control HepG2 cell, 652 IncRNAs (528 up-regulated and 124 down-regulated), 655 mRNAs (527 upregulated and 128 down regulated) and 114 miRNAs (55 miRNAs up-regulated and 59 down-regulated) were differentially expressed in dexamethasone treated HepG2 cell. Pathway analysis showed that the fatty acid biosynthesis, insulin resistance, PPAR signaling pathway, regulation of lipolysis in adipocytes, carbohydrate digestion and absorption, steroid hormone biosynthesis signaling pathways had a close relationship with dexamethasone induced steatosis. 10 highly dysregulated mRNAs and 20 miRNAs, which are closely related to lipid metabolism, were identified and validated by PCR, which followed by ceRNA analysis. CeRNA network analysis identified 5 lipid metabolism related genes, including CYP7A1, CYP11A1, PDK4, ABHD5, ACSL1. It also identified 12 miRNAs (miR-23a-3p, miR-519d-3p, miR-4328, miR-15b-5p etc.) and 177 IncRNAs (ENST00000508884, ENST00000608794, ENST00000568457 etc.). Our results provide a foundation and an expansive view of the roles and mechanisms of ncRNAs in dexamethasone induced steatosis.

AB Background: Although the influence of a common variant in the glucokinase regulatory gene (GCKR rs780094) in type 2 diabetes mellitus has been well documented, less data however, is available of its role in gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). We carried out a case control study to assess the association between GCKR rs780094 and GDM in the Asian, and also a meta-analysis to further assess the strength of the association.
   Methods: Demographic, clinical and genotype data were determined for 1122 women (267 cases and 855 controls) recruited from the University of Malaya Medical Centre in the Klang Valley, Kuala Lumpur. Relevant articles were identified from Pubmed, Embase, MEDLINE, and Web of Science. Extraction of data was carried out and summary estimates of the association between rs780094 and GDM were examined.
   Results: The frequency of risk allele C was significantly higher in the cases than controls (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.09-1.66, P = 0.006). The C allele was also associated with increased level of random 2-hour fasting plasma glucose and pregravid body mass index. Meta-analysis further confirmed the association of the GCKR rs780094 with GDM (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.14-1.52, P = 0.0001).
   Conclusion: This study strongly suggests that GCKR rs780094-C is associated with increased risk of GDM.

AB The domestic yak (Bos grunniens) is a culturally important animal that lives at high altitude and is farmed by Tibetan herders for its meat, milk, and other animal by-products. Within the animal, adipose tissue is an important store and source of energy and is used to maintain adequate body temperature during the extended cold seasons. Exploring the biomolecular role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the regulation of growth, development, and metabolism of yak adipocytes may provide valuable insights into the physiology of adipogenesis in the yak. This study investigated whether and how miR-200a (a miRNA recently reported to promote adipogenesis in ST2 bone marrow stromal cells) regulates adipocyte differentiation in the yak. Expression levels of miR-200a gradually increased during day 0 to day 8 of adipocyte differentiation, and transfection of adipocytes with miR-200a enhanced lipid accumulation and triglyceride content compared to control (un-transfected) adipocytes. We additionally verified (using qRT-PCR analysis) that miR-200a increased the expression of adipocyte-specific genes involved in lipogenic transcription (PPAR gamma, ELVOL, and C/EBP alpha), fatty acid synthesis (ACC, ACS, SCD, and FAS), and fatty acid transport (DGAT, LPL, and FABP4). We also found that transfection of adipocytes with miR200a resulted in suppression of the levels of noncanonical Wnt signaling transcription factors (Wnt5a, TAKI, and NLK). These results indicate that miRNA-200a plays an important role in promoting yak adipocyte differentiation that may operate via the suppression of noncanonical Wnt signaling.

AB Co-located 5S rDNA genes and interstitial telomeric sites (ITS) revealed the involvement of multiple 5S rDNA clusters in chromosome rearrangements of Loricariidae. Interstitial (TTAGGG)n vestiges, in addition to telomeric sites, can coincide with locations of chromosomal rearrangements, and they are considered to be hotspots for chromosome breaks. This study aimed the molecular characterization of 5S rDNA in two Rineloricaria latirostris populations and examination of roles of 5S rDNA in breakpoint sites and its in situ localization. Rineloricaria latirostris from Brazil's Das Pedras river (2n = 46 chromosomes) presented five pairs identified using a 5S rDNA probe, in addition to a pair bearing a co-located ITS/SS rDNA. Rineloricaria latirostris from the Piumhi river (2n = 48 chromosomes) revealed two pairs containing 5S rDNA, without ITS. A 702-bp amplified sequence, using 5S rDNA primers, revealed an insertion of the MT transposable element (TE), referred to as a degenerate 5S rDNA. Double-FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization) demonstrated co-localization of 5S rDNA/degenerate 5S rDNA, 5S rDNA/hAT and ITS/5S rDNA from the Das Pedras river population. Piumhi river isolates possessed only 5S rDNA sites. We suggest that the degenerate 5S rDNA was generated by unequal crossing over, which was driven by invasion of hAT, establishing a breakpoint region susceptible to chromosome breakage, non-homologous recombination and Robertsonian (Rb) fusion. Furthermore, the presence of clusters of 5S rDNA at fusion points in other armored catfish species suggests its re-use and that these regions represent hotspots for evolutionary rearrangements within Loricariidae genomes.

AB Background and aim: Insulin resistance plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Recently, paraoxonase-1(PON1) is reported to have an ability to reduce insulin resistance by promoting glucose transporter-4 (GLUT-4) expression in vitro. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in PON1 is associated with variability in enzyme activity and concentration. Based on this we aimed to investigate the association of PON1 (Q192R and L55M) polymorphisms with the risk of developing insulin resistance in adult South Indian population.
   Methods: Two hundred and eighty seven (287) Type 2 diabetes patients and 293 healthy controls were enrolled in this study. All the study subjects were genotyped for PON1 (Q192R and L55M) missense polymorphisms using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCRRFLP) method. Fasting serum insulin level was measured by ELISA.
   Results: The distribution of QR/RR and LM/MM genotypes were significantly higher in type 2 diabetes patients compared with healthy controls. Moreover, the R and M alleles were significantly associated with type 2 diabetes with an Odds Ratio of 1.68 (P < 0.005) and 2.24 (P < 0.005) respectively. SNP 192 Q > R genotypes were found to be significantly associated with higher BMI, cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, fasting serum insulin and HOMA-IR. Further, the mutant allele or genotypes of PON1 L55M were associated with higher BMI, triglycerides, VLDL, fasting serum insulin and HOMA-IR among adult type 2 diabetes patients.
   Conclusion: PON1 (Q192R and L55M) polymorphisms may play a crucial role in pathogenesis and susceptibility of insulin resistance thus leads to the development of type 2 diabetes in South Indian population.

AB Kruppel-like Factors (KLF) are responsible for regulating many genes involved in physiological and pathological processes. They are characterized by three conserved zinc-fingers in the DNA-binding domain, wherein mutations could affect the binding efficiency and transcription regulation. This study aimed to perform bioinformatics analysis to determine the most deleterious non-synonymous variants in KLFs involved in cardiac development and diseases, and their effects over the protein structure and stability. Eight hundred and fifty non-synonymous variants were found in seven KLFs related to cardiac diseases. Seventeen algorithms were used to predict the effect of selected variants over the structure and function of seven KLFs. The Top3 variants were selected in each category of conserved and non-conserved residues in the zinc-finger (ZF) domain. KLF5 p.Cys410Phe was the only variant predicted as deleterious in all algorithms, occurring in a conserved residue of zinc ion interaction. KLF15 p.Arg364Pro was the only variant predicted to affect the DNA-binding, and also occurs in a conserved ZF-domain. Our bioinformatics analysis determined potential variants that may lead to development of cardiac diseases, as well as reinforced the importance of KLF analysis in vitro and in vivo.

AB Objective: The present study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanism underlying congenital obstructive nephropathy (CON).
   Methods: The microarray dataset GSE70879 was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus, including 3 kidney samples of megabladder mice and 4 control kidneys. Using this dataset, differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) were identified between the kidney samples from megabladder mice and controls, followed by identification of the target genes for these DEMs and construction of a DEM and target gene interaction network. Additionally, the target genes were subjected to Gene Ontology and pathway enrichment analyses, and were used for construction of a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Finally, regulatory networks were constructed to analyze transcription factors for the key miRNAs.
   Results: From 17 DEMs identified between kidney samples of megabladder mice and controls, 3 key miRNAs were screened, including mmu-miR-150-5p, mmu-miR-374b-5p and mmu-miR-126a-5p. The regulatory networks identified vascular endothelial growth factor A (Vegfa) as the common target gene of mmu-miR-150-5p and five transcription factors, including nuclear receptor subfamily 4, group A, member 2 (Nr4a2), Jun dimerisation protein 2 (Jdp2), Kruppel-like factor 6 (Klf6), Neurexophilin-3 (Nxph3) and RNA binding motif protein 17 (Rbm17). The gene encoding phosphatase and tensin homolog (Pten) was found to be co-regulated by mmu-miR-374b-5p and high mobility group protein A1 (Hmga1), whereas the kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene (Kras) was identified as a common target gene of mmu-miR-126a-5p and paired box 6 (Pax6).
   Conclusions: In summary, the above-listed key miRNAs, transcription factors and key genes may be involved in the development of CON.

AB Wastewater sludge are characterized by complex rheological properties, strongly dependent on solids concentration and temperature. These properties are required for process hydrodynamic modelling but their correct measurement is often challenging at high solids concentrations. This is especially true to model the hydrodynamic of dewatered sludge during drying process where solids content (TS) increases with residence time. Indeed, until now, the literature mostly focused on the rheological characterization of sludge at low and moderate TS (between 4 and 8%). Limited attention was paid to pasty and highly concentrated sludge mainly because of the difficulties to carry out the measurements. Results reproducibility appeared to be poor and thus may not be always fully representative of the effective material properties. This work demonstrates that reproducible results can be obtained by controlling cracks and fractures which always take place in classical rotational rheometry. In that purpose, a well-controlled experimental procedure has been developed, allowing the exact determination of the surface effectively sheared. This surface is calculated by scattering a classical stress sweep with measurements at a reference strain value. The implementation of this procedure allows the correct determination of solid like characteristics from 20 to 45% TS but also shows that pasty and highly concentrated sludge highlight normal forces caused by dilatancy. Moreover the surface correction appears to be independent of TS in the studied range. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Strontium (Sr) is a chemical element that is often used as a tracer in hydrogeochemical studies, and is ubiquitously distributed as a radioactive contaminant in nuclear sites in the form of strontium-90 (Sr-90). At the interface between groundwater and surface water, wetlands possess unique hydrogeochemical properties whose impact on Sr transport has not been investigated thoroughly. In this study, the adsorption and desorption of Sr was investigated on six natural wetland substrates and two mixes of exogenous media and wetland sediment: winter and summer wetland sediments, decayed cattails, wood, leaf litter, moss, bone charcoal, and clinoptilolite. The composition of the organic matter was characterized using carbon-13, solid phase Nuclear Magnetic Resonance analysis. The range of the substrates' adsorption coefficients obtained could be explained by factors indicative of proteins in the organic matter, which were shown to support strong and poorly reversible Sr adsorption. In contrast, the proportion of carbohydrates and lignin were found to be indicative of lower adsorption coefficients and higher desorption. The implications of these results for Sr pollution remediation in wetlands are discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Transparent exopolymer particles (TEP) and their precursors are gel-like acidic polysaccharide particles. Both TEP precursors and TEP have been identified as causal factors in fouling of desalination and water treatment systems. For comparison between studies, it is important to accurately measure the amount and fouling capacity of both components. However, the accuracy and recovery of the currently used Alcian blue based TEP measurement of different surrogates and different size fractions are not well understood. In this study, we compared Alcian blue based TEP measurements with a total carbohydrate assay method. Three surrogates; xanthan gum, pectin and alginic acid; were evaluated at different salinities. Total carbohydrate concentrations of particulates (>0.4 mu m) and their precursors (<0.4 mu m, >10 kDa) varied depending on water salinity and method of recovery. As xanthan gum is the most frequently used surrogate in fouling studies, TEP concentration is expressed as xanthan gum equivalents (mg XG(eq)/L) in this study. At a salinity of 35 mg/L sea salt, total carbohydrate assays showed a much higher particulate TEP fraction for alginic acid (38%) compared to xanthan gum (9%) and pectin (12%). The concentrations of particulate TEP therefore may only represent similar to 10% of the total mass; while precursor TEP represents similar to 80% of the total TEP. This highlights the importance of reporting both particulate and precursor TEP for membrane biofouling studies. The calculated concentrations of TEP and their precursors in seawater samples are also highly dependent on type of surrogate and resulting calibration factor. A linear correlation between TEP recovery and calibration factor was demonstrated in this study for all three surrogates. The relative importance and accuracy of measurement method, particulate size, surrogate type, and recovery are described in detail in this study. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Recycling of acid from aqueous waste streams is highly important not only from the environmental point of view but also for developing the sustainable technology. One of the effective ways to recover acid from aqueous waste streams is the anion-exchange membrane based diffusion-dialysis. The work presents the synthesis and characterization of anion-exchange pore-filled membranes for the objective of recovery of high concentration of acid by diffusion dialysis. The membranes were prepared by anchoring the guest organic-inorganic anionic gel in the pores of the host poly(propylene) membrane by in situ UV-initiator induced polymerization of the appropriate monomers along with cross-linker. The removal of nitric acid in the presence of different representative monovalent, divalent and trivalent nitrates and the leakage of these ions through anion exchange membrane have been studied by DD technique for optimizing the chemical composition of the membrane. The nitric acid permeation rate of the membrane with the optimized composition has been found to be considerably faster than the commercial Selemion membrane without sacrificing salt leakage. The performance of the optimized pore-filled anion exchange membranes has been found to be independent of the acid concentration, nature of the anion and substrate and has been observed to be solely dependent on the guest inorganic-organic hybrid anionic gel component. The membranes have been found to be stable and reusable for the acid recovery. Removal of nitric acid as high as 90% from the simulated high level nuclear waste with the optimized grafted pore filled membrane has been achieved with negligible salt transport.

AB The widespread adoption of engineered wetlands designed for water treatment is hindered by uncertainties in system reliability, resilience and management associated with coupled biological and physical processes. To better understand how shallow unit process open-water wetlands self-colonize and evolve, we analyzed the composition of the microbial community in benthic biomats from system establishment through approximately 3 years of operation. Our analysis was conducted across three parallel demonstration-scale (7500 m(2)) cells located within the Prado Constructed Wetlands in Southern California. They received water from the Santa Ana River (5.9 +/- 0.2 mg/L NO3-N), a water body where the flow is dominated by municipal wastewater effluent from May to November. Phylogenetic inquiry and microscopy confirmed that diatoms and an associated aerobic bacterial community facilitated early colonization. After approximately nine months of operation, coinciding with late summer, an anaerobic community emerged with the capability for nitrate attenuation. Varying the hydraulic residence time (HRT) from 1 to 4 days the subsequent year resulted in modest ecological changes across the three parallel cells that were most evident in the outlet regions of the cells. The community that established at this time was comparatively stable for the remaining years of operation and converged with one that had previously formed approximately 550 km (350 miles) away in a pilot-scale (400 m(2)) wetland in Northern California. That system received denitrified (20.7 +/- 0.7 mg/L NO3-N), secondary treated municipal wastewater for 5 years of operation. Establishment of a core microbiome between the two systems revealed a strong overlap of both aerobic and anaerobic taxa with approximately 50% of the analyzed bacterial sequences shared between the two sites. Additionally the same species of diatom, Stauirsa construens var. venter, was prolific in both systems as the putative dominant primary producer. Our results indicate that despite differences in scale, geographic location and source waters, the shallow open water wetland design can select for a rapid convergence of microbial structure and functionality associated with the self-colonizing benthic biomat This resulting biomat matures over the first growing season with operational parameters such as HRT further exerting a modest selective bias on community succession.

AB Autotrophic denitrification has been widely studied for odor mitigation, corrosion control and nitrogen removal in recent years. This paper examines the response of sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (SOB) driven autotrophic denitrification under short-term stress of dissolved sulfide. A series of batch tests were conducted to investigate the effect of different sulfide concentrations (0-1600 mg-total dissolved sulfide (TDS)/L) on autotrophic denitrification and sulfide oxidation by SOB-enriched sludge. Our results show that autotrophic denitrification (NO3- to N-2) was stimulated up to 200 mg-TDS/L with a maximum denitrification rate of 9.4 mg-N/g-volatile suspended solids (VSS)/h, and the nitrite reduction was a rate limiting step. When sulfide concentration was higher than 200 mg-TDS/L, it inhibited nitrate reductase, and nitrate reduction became the rate limiting step according to Edwards and Aiba inhibition models. Sulfide oxidation, however, was not inhibited and the maximum rate of 100.3 mg-TDS/g-VSS/h was obtained at sulfide concentration of 1000 mg-TDS/L. It is important to point out that the transient inhibition on autotrophic denitrification caused by high sulfide stress was resilient and non-lethal with no significant changes in cell viability even under sulfide concentration of 1000 mg-TDS/L. This study reveals the stimulatory and inhibitory effects of dissolved sulfide on SOB driven autotrophic denitrification and its possible underlying mechanism with discussion on engineering implications.

AB Since the 1980s, the pulp and paper industry in Finland has resulted in the accumulation of fibres in lake sediments. One such site in Lake Nasijarvi contains approximately 1.5 million m(3) sedimented fibres. In this study, the methane production potential of the sedimented fibres (on average 13% total solids (TS)) was determined in batch assays. Furthermore, the methane production from solid (on average 20% TS) and liquid fractions of sedimented fibres after solid -liquid separation was studied. The sedimented fibres resulted in fast methane production and high methane yields of 250 +/- 80 L CH4/kg volatile solids (VS). The main part (ca. 90%) of the methane potential was obtained from the solid fraction of the sedimented fibres. In addition, the VS removal from the total and solid sedimented fibres was high, 61-65% and 63-78%, respectively. The liquid fraction also contained a large amount of organics (on average 8.8 g COD/L), treatment of which also has to be considered. The estimations of the methane production potentials in the case area showed potential up to 40 million m(3) of methane from sedimented fibres. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Sodium persulfate has become the most popular oxidant source for the in situ chemical oxidation (ISCO) treatment of organic contaminants in the subsurface. The most common persulfate activators, iron chelates and base, are often ineffective in initiating the generation of reactive oxygen species in field applications. In this study, glucose was investigated as a persulfate activator in systems containing varying concentrations of sodium hydroxide using nitrobenzene as a hydroxyl radical probe and hexachloroethane as a reductant + nucleophile probe. Glucose activation of persulfate increased as a function of sodium hydroxide addition, but was still effective at circumneutral pH regimes. Use of central composite rotatable experimental designs showed that hydroxyl radical and reductant + nucleophile generation rates increased as a function of persulfate at near-neutral pH regimes. Glucose activation of persulfate has the advantages over other activation pathways of more options and flexibility for effective process chemistry and of minimizing or eliminating the mass of sodium hydroxide added to the subsurface. The results of this research can be applied in the field by first evaluating glucose activation compared to base and iron chelate activation of persulfate in laboratory treatability studies.

AB Phosphorus (P) is an important and often limiting element in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem. A lack of understanding of its distribution and structures in the environment limits the design of effective P mitigation and recovery approaches. Here we developed a robust method employing size exclusion chromatography (SEC) coupled to an ICP-MS to determine the molecular weight (MW) distribution of P in environmental samples. The most abundant fraction of P varied widely in different environmental samples: (i) orthophosphate was the dominant fraction (93-100%) in one lake, two aerosols and DOC isolate samples, (ii) species of 400-600 Da range were abundant (74-100%) in two surface waters, and (iii) species of 150-350 Da range were abundant in wastewater effluents. SEC-DOC of the aqueous samples using a similar SEC column showed overlapping peaks for the 400-600 Da species in two surface waters, and for >20 kDa species in the effluents, suggesting that these fractions are likely associated with organic matter. The MW resolution and performance of SEC-ICP-MS agreed well with the time integrated results obtained using conventional ultrafiltration method. Results show that SEC in combination with ICP-MS and DOC has the potential to be a powerful and easy-to-use method in identifying unknown fractions of P in the environment. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB To address the undesired effect of chemotherapeutants in aquaculture, ozone has been suggested as an alternative to improve water quality. To ensure safe and robust treatment, it is vital to define the ozone demand and ozone kinetics of the specific water matrix to avoid ozone overdose. Different ozone dosages were applied to water in freshwater recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS). Experiments were performed to investigate ozone kinetics and demand, and to evaluate the effects on the water quality, particularly in relation to fluorescent organic matter. This study aimed at predicting a suitable ozone dosage for water treatment based on daily ozone demand via laboratory studies. These ozone dosages will be eventually applied and maintained at these levels in pilot-scale RAS to verify predictions. Selected water quality parameters were measured, including natural fluorescence and organic compound concentration changes during ozonation. Ozone reactions were described by first order kinetics. Organic matter, assessed as chemical oxygen demand and fluorescence, decreased by 25% (low O-3), 30% (middle O-3) and 53% (high O-3), while water transmittance improved by 15% over an 8-day period. No fish mortality was observed. Overall, this study confirms that ozone can improve RAS water quality, provides a better understanding of the ozone decay mechanisms that can be used to define further safe ozone treatment margins, and that fluorescence could be used as a monitoring tool to control ozone. This study might be used as a tool to design ozone systems for full-scale RAS by analysing water sample from the specific RAS in the laboratory. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Degradation of recalcitrant naphthenic acids from raw and ozonated oil

AB In this study, a fixed-bed biofiltration system (biofilter) that utilized indigenous microorganisms was developed for the reclamation of oil sands process-affected water (OSPW). With the assistance of quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), indigenous microorganisms from OSPW were able to attach to the surface of sand media and form biofilms. The number of total bacteria on the biofilter media reached a steady state (109/g) after 23 days of operation. Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography/High Resolution Mass Spectrometry (UPLC/HRMS) analysis showed that 21.8% of the classical naphthenic acids (NAs) removal was achieved through the circulation of raw OSPW on the biofilter for 8 times (equivalent to a hydraulic retention time of 16 h). When ozonation with utilized ozone dose of 30 mg/L was applied as pretreatment, the classical NAs in the ozonated OSPW were removed by 89.3% with an accelerated biodegradation rate of 0.5 mg/L/h. Compared with other biofilm reactors such as moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR), ozonation pretreatment could benefit the biodegradation of NAs in the biofilter more (classical NA removal: 89.3% vs. 34.4%), especially for those with high carbon number and cyclicity. The combined ozonation-biofiltration process could remove 92.7% of classical NAs from raw OSPW in 16 h. Although both ozonation and biofiltration alone did not show degradation of oxidized NAs from raw OSPW, the combined process led to a 52.9% and 42.6% removal for O-3-NAs and O-4-NAs, respectively, which were the dominant oxidized NA species in OSPW. Metagenomic sequencing analysis showed that Rhodococcus was the dominant bacterial genus on the sand media, which may play a crucial role during the NA biodegradation. With the advantage of high NA removal efficiency, the combined ozonation-biofiltration process is a promising approach for NA degradation and shows high potential to be scaled up for in-situ OSPW treatment.

AB Excess nitrogen (N) export from lowland artificial watersheds (polders) is often assumed to be a major contributor to the cultural eutrophication of downstream aquatic ecosystems. However, the complex transport processes characterizing lowland areas pose significant challenges in accurately quantifying their actual role. In this study, we developed a dynamic model to track N sources and transport pathways in lowland polders. The model is able to accommodate all the unique characteristics of polder dynamics, including artificial drainage, and interactions among surface water, groundwater and soil water. Our model was calibrated and validated against water level data and nitrogen concentrations measured in a lowland polder (Polder Jian) in China during the 2014-2016 period. Model performance was satisfactory with an R-2 value of 0.55 and an NS value of 0.53 for total N concentrations. The characterization of the various components of water budget and N cycle derived by the model was on par with local empirical estimates. N export from Polder Jian was approximately 57 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) and was distinctly higher than values reported from nearby non-polder areas. The largest fraction of N export stemmed from seepage. To our knowledge, this is the first dynamic model to quantify N export from a watershed with artificial drainage network and can be used to design remedial measures of ecosystem degradation.

The crystal symmetry, ferroelectric response, and temperature stable dielectric properties were investigated as a function of different LT-content. The X-ray diffraction study of BFBTMC-LT piezoceramics revealed no remarkable variation in the crystal symmetry. The value of maximum polarization (P-m approximate to 24 mu C/cm(2)) and remnant polarization (P-r approximate to 18 mu C/cm(2)) were obtained at BFBTMC-0.010LT composition. The maximum temperature of permittivity (T-max) decreased by the addition of LT-content in BFBTMC materials. The un-doped sample was ferroelectric; a change to relaxor behavior occurred by the addition of LT-content, with broad frequency dependent curves of dielectric mid-value permittivity (epsilon(rmid)) and tangent loss as a function of temperature. A significant enhancement occurred at 3 mol% LT-modified BFBTMC ceramics, with epsilon(rmid) = 5000 +/- 9.5% (250-450 degrees C at 1 kHz). These results are favorable for practical applications in high temperature dielectrics. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Ruddlesden-Popper type La2NiO4+delta (LNO) oxide was investigated as a novel pseudocapacitive electrode and performed high performance with the capacitance of 657.4 F g(-1) under the scan rate of 2 mV s(-1) in 3 M KOH electrolyte. Two cathodic peaks and one anodic peak in CV curves of LNO in KOH electrolyte indicate the special oxygen insertion/extrusion processes because its structure alternates with perovskite LaNiO3 layers and LaO rock-salt layers in succession. Cycle performance of LNO at a relatively high current density of 10 A g(-1) is approximately 96.2% after 500 cycles in 3 M KOH electrolyte, showing good cycling stability. This confirms LNO as a potential candidate for high performance pseudocapacitor electrodes. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Medical implants play a key role in treating bone fractures. Permanent implants are currently used for immobilization of fractures and bearing physiological loads during bone healing. After bone has healed, these implants, if not removed, often cause complications in the long run; and secondary surgeries for removing them pose additional discomfort and expenses for patients. Magnesium (Mg)-based bioresorbable implants, can potentially eliminate the need for additional surgeries by degrading safely over time in the human body. When studying the degradation behaviors of Mg-based implants in vitro, it is important to simulate physiological conditions in vivo closely, including loading. Considering that implants often carry physiological loads in vivo and mechanical stresses affect the degradation rate of Mg, a novel loading device was designed and manufactured for studying Mg degradation under load over a long period of time in a simulated body fluid in vitro. Degradation of Mg rods was investigated by immersing in a revised simulated body fluid (rSBF) for two weeks while a consistent compressive load was applied using the loading device. The results showed that the loading device provided a consistent load of 500 +/- 45 N during the two weeks of immersion. Mg rods showed a significant faster degradation rate under the applied load, as demonstrated by a higher mass loss of the sample, a higher pH increase and Mg2+ ion release in the rSBF.

DE 3D-printing; Gelatin membrane; Heterogeneous tissue; Tissue engineering
AB Although biological membranes may look like a 2D assembly, they often have complex structures in their 3rd dimension. Using layer-by-layer assembly, 3D-printing can offer an advanced and unique approach for the fabrication of such models. However, printing of some widely used hydrogels, such as gelatin, encounters experimental difficulties due to their rheological properties. In this paper, we (a) discuss the complexities involved in printing gelatin, (b) offer a reproducible approach to overcome such difficulties, and (c) present the detailed design criteria and the production process of such 3D-printed gelatin membranes by exemplifying scaffolds suitable for growth of full-thickness oral mucosa as a heterogeneous tissue.

AB Porous ZnCo2O4 nanosheets (NSs) were synthesized via a solvothermal method in ethylene glycol (EG) and water combined solvent, and followed by calcination in air at 400 degrees C for 2 h. No surfactant or template was employed during the entire synthetic process. The ZnCo2O4 NSs have a thickness of about 100-150 nm, and possess a BET surface area and pore size of 54.4 m(2) g(-1) and 7.8 nm, respectively. Such porous NSs would gradually stack into quasi-cube-like microstructures with reaction time prolonging. Quasi-cubes with edge length ranging from 10 to 30 mu m were produced, and NSs almost disappeared after 15 h of solvothermal treatment. It was found that the volume ratio of EG to water played important role for the final shapes of ZnCo2O4. Some irregular and broken NSs were formed if less amount of EG was used, while quasi-microcubes stacked by NSs were dominant in the product as the ratio of EG to water increased to 4:1. The current approach is simple and low cost, and can be extended for preparation of other transition metal oxides in nanoscaled size and porous structure. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A Li+-OH exfoliation system was designed to prepare graphene in water without surfactants or sonication. Due to the positive charge transferred from intercalating Li+ ions to adjacent C atoms, OH could add on the graphene sheets and further promote their affinity to water, resulting in efficient exfoliation of graphene in water. The as-prepared graphene concentration was up to 0.09 mg.mL (1), and sheet sizes range from 1 to 2 mu m. Detailed characterizations revealed the formation of high-quality and few-layer graphene sheets and confirmed the addition of hydroxyl groups on graphene sheets during exfoliation. This strategy has potential in scalable production of graphene in aqueous phase. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Synthesis of metal ions (Cd2+, Li+) doped CePO4 nanocrystals were achieved through a simple hydrothermal route at 150 degrees C using citric acid and poly-ethylene-glycol (PEG-6000). The results obtained reveal that the low percentage of (Cd2+, Li+) dopant affect the structure showing a weak decrease in the lattice parameters compared to the CePO4. The total electrical conductivity plots obtained from impedance spectra, between 300 and 450 degrees C, indicated that the activation energies for CePO4, Ce0.9Cd0.15PO4, Ce0.9Cd0.13Li0.04PO4 are 1.05, 0.99 and 0.72 eV, respectively, showing an increase of the total conductivity as Li-content increases. The conduction mechanism is described using correlated barrier hopping model. The partial substitution leads to the improvement capacity when increasing the Li-content from 65F.g (1) for Ce0.9Cd0.15PO4 to 75F.g (1) for Ce0.9Cd0.13Li0.04PO4. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The gas sensing properties were attributed to the electron hopping mechanism in V2O5 center dot 1.6H(2)O nanostructures at room temperature. We observed that the change in morphology of V2O5 center dot 1.6H(2)O helps to augment the overall response (to 53% at 300 ppm) with very low response/recovery time (9/10 s). The excellent sensing properties at room temperature, make V2O5 center dot 1.6H(2)O nanostructures a potential material for He gas sensing application. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

By analyzing the zeta potential and viscosity, the optimal slurries with good dispersibility and stability were prepared when the pH was about 10.5. In 6 T, c-axis of TiB2 grain was oriented to parallel to the direction of magnetic field and its a or b-axis was perpendicular to the direction of magnetic field in TiB2 ceramics. The degree of texture was 0.80 on the top surface perpendicular to the direction of magnetic field in the green body. After sintering without the magnetic field, the degree of texture reached 0.94. Sintering process promoted the improvement of degree of texture in TiB2 ceramics by grain growth. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The growth of gallium nitride nanowires on c-plane sapphire substrates using binary catalytic alloy was investigated by manipulating growth time and precursor-to-substrate distance. The variations in structural, optical and morphological behaviour of the samples at different growth conditions were observed using X-ray diffractometer, cathodoluminescence spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. It was noticed that, thickness of the nanowires decreased with increase in growth time and precursor-to-substrate distance. Simultaneously, length of the nanowires increased with growth time and varied with precursor-to-substrate distance. The reduction in nanowire thickness was found to have a positive effect in improving luminescence property and bandgap of the grown nanowires. The results indicate that this material system can be catered for optoelectronic device applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Biodiesel obtained from vegetable oils is considered a renewable fuel and because of its environmental advantages and low cost it is in sight of many investigations all around the world. This work discusses the application of a new metal-organic framework (MOF) on the ultrasonic-assisted transesterification process of Erythrina mexicana oil. The new heterogeneous catalyst cobalt (II) metal-organic framework MOF (1), was synthesized by the hydrothermal reaction of Co(NO3)(2)center dot 6H(2)O, 1,2-di-(4-pyridyl)-ethylene (L1) and 5-Nitroisophthalic acid (L2) in water at 160 degrees C. Monocrystal X-ray diffraction method was employed to determine the molecular structure. The reaction to obtain biodiesel was carried out in an ultrasonic bath and finished in methanol at 60 degrees C and to determine and quantify the oil composition the Gas Chromatography (GC) method was employed, supported by H-1 and C-13 NMR spectroscopy.

TI Mechanism for the development of Sn-Cu alloy coatings produced by pulsed
   current electrodeposition

ID TIN-COPPER ALLOYS
AB Pulsed current (PC) electrodeposition has become an essential tool for producing coatings in a wide range of industries. The pulsed current can have a significant influence on the composition, morphology and properties of electrodeposited coatings and this is particularly true when plating an alloy. In this study, the mechanism for the development of Sn-Cu alloy coatings produced by PC electrodeposition was investigated. Sn-Cu alloy coatings produced by PC electrodeposition were essentially composed of a dual layer of Sn-Cu electrodeposits and Cu6Sn5 intermetallic compounds (IMCs). In addition, it was observed that pulsed Sn-Cu electrodeposits exhibited an increased Cu content. Experiments were carefully designed to elucidate the mechanism for this important finding and based on their results a theory is proposed which explains the increased Cu content in terms of a metal displacement reaction occurring during the 'relaxation' time of PC electrodeposition.

AB Different types of the remote phosphor have been investigated to enhance the light-emitting performance with less time-dependent degradations of the emission properties. Here, two different remote phosphor approaches are introduced to optimize the effect of red phosphor in the yellow phosphor-driven white light-emitting diodes (LED)s. These approaches combining the printing technology with a UV-curing process are designed for flexible planar white LEDs with a thin layer thickness of a few tens of micrometer-scale. A screen-printing process was utilized to obtain the mixed or stacked phosphor layers based on commercial yellow and red phosphors. The phosphor particles were found to be dispersed uniformly in the cured UV-polymer matrix. The resultant luminescence characteristics depended on the type of remote phosphor and the relative content of red phosphor. The mixing approach was more effective in raising color rendering index (CRI) while minimizing the reduction of luminous efficacy. As a result, a luminous efficacy of similar to 101 lm/W and a CRI of similar to 83.1 were obtained for the mixed sample with 5 wt% red phosphor, which correspond to a decrease of similar to 11.2% and an increase of similar to 9.3% compared to the reference sample.

AB This work correlates the densification behaviors of high entropy alloy powders with the alloying order. Mechanically alloyed powders (CoFeNi, CoFeNiCr, CoFeNiCrMn and CoFeNiCrMnAl alloys) were non-isothermally sintered using dilatometer. It was demonstrated that when the alloying order or the number of alloying elements were increased from 3 elements to 6 elements, sintering kinetics were changed. Materials exhibit sluggish grain growth, reducing densification rates and increasing activation energies of sintering, with increasing configurational entropy. Increasing trend of micro-hardness also indicates the better mechanical properties of such alloys. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this manuscript, Au/CH3NH3PbI3/Au metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) photoelectric detectors with different concentrations of [6,6]-Phenyl-C61-butyric Acid Methyl Ester (PCBM) doping are studied. It is found that with PCBM doping, the zero voltage shifts of MSM detector are inhibited, and the dark currents increase slightly which result in the smaller light-dark current ratio and detectivity. It is speculated that the vacancies in CH3NH3PbI3 are filled by PCBM, and the captured electrons are release. The MSM detector with 0.01 wt% PCBM doping shows high responsivity (35 mAW(-1)), detectivity (4.126-10(10) Jones) and response time (< 2 ms) under 5 V bias voltage, respectively. It is indicated that appropriate proportion of PCBM doping is a suitable way to optimize the performance of perovskite-based photo-detectors. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A facile room-temperature synthesis method was employed to prepare MnMoO4 center dot 0.9H(2)O nanorods. Electrochemical characterization showed that the sample offered a high specific capacitance of 215 F/g at a current density of 1 mA/cm(2) and a low ionic resistance of 0.65 Omega. This performance was higher when compared with hydrothermally synthesized MnMoO4 which had been thermally treated at 300 degrees C. This makes our room temperature synthesized electrode material an attractive low cost choice for supercapacitor application. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB An electrochemical etching based on HCl solution was developed for use in the chemical lift-off of InP membranes. Under the same etching conditions, the diameter of InP pores increases with the increase of etching depth or etching voltage. When the etching depth or etching voltage exceeds a critical value, the InP layer can be electropolished, leading to the lift-off of nanoporous InP membranes. The lift-off membranes can be transferred onto a substrate. Compared to the planar InP wafer, the etched InP wafer and transferred InP membrane present stronger photoluminescence emission and weaker reflectance in the range of 250-850 nm.

AB A cheap sodium ferric EDTA-derived material (EDTAFeNa-KB-HT1) was prepared via one-step pyrolysis of a complex of Ketjenblack EC-300J and inorganic-organic hybrid EDTAFeNa, which was employed as both nitrogen and ferric precursors. The EDTAFeNa-KB-HT1 was proved to be an iron and nitrogen co-doped Fe-N-C material with micro-mesoporous structure and large surface area. The EDTAFeNa-KB-HT1 exhibited high selectivity (80-100%) towards oxygen reduction reaction for electrocatalytic synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) concurrently with generation of large current density, which could be potentially a safe, efficient and environment-friendly fuel cell method for the scale production of H2O2.

AB Al-Cr porous intermetallics were fabricated by thermal explosion (TE) reaction. Microstructure (phase composition and pore characteristics) and properties (expansion behavior, density and oxidation resistance) of Al-Cr sintered products were investigated. Results showed that the sintered products retained their original cylindrical shape with an obvious expansion behavior and high open porosity. The interconnected pores were mainly inherited from green compacts or come from the diffusion of liquid Al and volume expansion. The phase compositions of the specimen with Al:Cr = 8:5 and 9:4 were mainly Al8Cr5 with minor Al4Cr (in the specimen with Al: Cr = 9:4), Al2O3 and unreacted Cr. The intermetallics of the specimen with Al:Cr = 8:5 had superior oxidation resistance. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB NiCo2S4 nanosheet thin films were prepared on the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conductive glass by a two-step approach. First, NiCo2O4 nanosheets were synthesized by rapid microwave-assisted solution method, and then they were converted to NiCo2S4 nanosheets by solution-based vulcanization reaction. The dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) with the NiCo2S4 as the counter electrode (CE) could reach a power conversion efficiency of 5.81%, exceeding a typical efficiency of 5.02% in DSSCs based on the sputtered Pt counter electrode. The synthesis simplicity, time efficiency, low cost, and excellent electrocatalytic characteristic make the NiCo2S4 nanosheet thin film promising as CE material for DSSC applications.

DE Thermoelectric materials; BiCuSeO; Ba/Pbdoping; Thermoelectric
   properties; Mechanical properties
AB The layered oxyselenide BiCuSeO thermoelectric ceramics are attracting more and more attention due to intrinsically low thermal conductivity. In this work, Bi1-x-yBaxPbyCuSeO (x = y = 0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08; x = 0, y = 0.08; x = 0.08, y = 0) bulks have been prepared by mechanical alloying (MA) and resistance pressing sintering (RPS) process, and the effects of Ba/Pb doping on the thermoelectric properties and Vickers hardness of p-type BiCuSeO ceramics have been investigated systematically. The results indicated that the substitution of Bi3+ by Ba2+/Pb2+ resulted in the significantly increase of electrical conductivity and power factor due to the introduction of the carriers into the conductive (Cu2Se2)(2-) layers as the result of the introduction of negative charge into the carrier-storaging (Bi2O2)(2+) layers. Specifically, the room temperature electrical conductivity significantly increases from similar to 8 Scm(-1) for pristine BiCuSeO to similar to 244 Scm(-1) for Bi0.92Ba0.04Pb0.04CuSeO, and further up to similar to 443 Scm(-1) for Bi0.84Ba0.08Pb0.08CuSeO. The maximum power factor of 0.66 mWm(-1)K(-2) and dimensionless figure of merit (ZT) value of 1.01 were obtained for the Bi0.88Ba0.06Pb0.06CuSeO at 873 K. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Herein, Selenium (Se) nanoparticles are synthesized in the host matrix of a neat imidazolium based room temperature ionic liquid (RTIL) by a rapid and facile approach at mild conditions. From the microscopic imaging studies, the size of the nanoparticles was determined to be 45 +/- 5 nm with globular morphology. XRD and TEM studies revealed the amorphous phase of the Se nanoparticles. This was further evident from the Raman mapping of the nanoparticles. Interestingly, the well-known amorphous to crystalline phase transformation of Se nanoparticles was found to be much slower (> 2 months) in RTIL compared to few minutes-to-days as reported in earlier studies. The underlying mechanism for the formation of the nanoparticles and their phase stability has been explained taking into account of the structural and the fluidic aspects of the RTIL.

XRD studies confirm the presence of diffraction peaks related to cubic crystal structure of CdO. Weak peaks related to the oxides of Cu, Fe, Mg, Zn, Ni and Mn were also observed. Nanosized grains were observed from the TEM image. EDX and XPS spectra confirm the presence of bioactive magnetic elements in the synthesized sample.

AB A novel Mg/TiNiCu composite was successfully fabricated from porous TiNiCu shape memory alloy (SMA) and pure Mg via non-pressure infiltration process with the aim of developing a new kind of high damping material with excellent mechanical properties. In order to restrain the formation of undesired Mg2Cu phase, the methods of short-time infiltration and rapid consolidation were adopted. Resultant material had homogenously distributed and 3D interconnected Mg particles in the TiNiCu matrix. Compared with porous TiNiCu SMA, in addition to the notable increase of storage modulus the damping property of Mg/TiNiCu composite was also obviously improved, which could be attributed to the superposition effect of multiple damping sources.

AB A novel assembling technique based on additive manufacturing and materials joining principles has been introduced for layered metal-polymer hybrid structures. The AddJoining technique produces layered hybrid structures, using polymer 3D printing methods. The feasibility of the technique was demonstrated using fused deposition modeling for single-lap joint configuration. Microstructure and mechanical strength of the joints were studied using two combinations of materials; aluminum 2024-T3 with acrylonitrile butadiene styrene and aluminum 2024-T3 with alternate layers of polyamide-6 and carbon-fiber-reinforced polyamide-6. The latter reached an average ultimate lap-shear strength of 21.9 +/- 1.1MPa, showing 19% superior performance to the adhesively bonded joints. This exploratory investigation showed the potential of AddJoining to produce metal-polymer layered structures. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Anisotropic bulk Nd2Fe14B/alpha-Fe nanohybrid magnets have been prepared by high-pressure thermal compression (HPTC) of the blends of 70 wt% Nd-lean Nd9Fe85.5Cu1.5B4 amorphous and 30 wt% Nd-rich Nd13.6Fe73.6Ga0.6Co6.6B5.6 nanocrystalline alloys. The nanohybrid magnets have a high fraction similar to 24 wt% of alpha-Fe phase and exhibit a (001) texture for Nd2Fe14B nanocrystals in both Nd-lean and Nd-rich regions. The Nd-lean region contains alpha-Fe and Nd2Fe14B nanograins with equivalent sizes of 19 nm and 27 nm and the Nd-rich region comprises Nd2Fe14B phase having lath nanograins with 20-35 nm in thickness and 50-142 nm in length. This nanohybid magnet exhibits a maximum energy product of 23 MGOe and an enhanced thermal stability. The present work provides a candidate route to fabricate high-performance bulk magnets for practical applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Hierarchical nickel microflowers were synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method using sodium hypophosphite as a mild reducing reagent and sodium tartrate as a complexing reagent. The flowers having a size ranging from 1.2 to 1.5 mu m were constructed by a novel solid-particle-core and petal-shell. The assembled rose-like petals possessed a thin thickness and seemed to be flexible like silk. Room temperature magnetic characterization of the nickel flowers demonstrated ferromagnetic property with an increased coercivity of 488.3 Oe, which was ascribed to the highly anisotropic shape of hierarchically flower-like microstructures. This work provides a simple strategy to fabricate stable nickel 3D flowers composed of numerous petals, and can be extended to the synthesis of other magnetic nanomaterials. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB The immersion and electrochemical degradation behaviors of as-extruded Mg-1.5Zn-0.6Zr-0.2Sc (ZK21-0.2Sc) alloy in Hank's solution with and without albumins were investigated and the influencing mechanism was elucidated. The immersion experiment showed that the presence of albumins could inhibit the corrosion of the ZK21-0.2Sc alloy through the adsorption effect at the initial immersion stage. With immersing on, the albumins underwent denaturation and began to show the chelation effect, which accelerated the corrosion of the ZK21-0.2Sc alloy. With increasing albumin concentration, the corrosion potential of the ZK21-0.2Sc alloy increased while the corrosion current density greatly reduced. The electrochemical test showed the presence of albumins had nearly no change to the cathodic Tafel slops, but the anodic Tafel slops increased obviously with increasing albumin concentration.

AB Novel magnetically separable Ag3PO4/CoFe2O4/graphene oxide (GO) composites with different mass ratios were prepared through a facile precipitation process. Photocatalytic activity of the as-prepared composites was evaluated by degrading methyl orange (MO) under visible light irradiation. The results indicated that Ag3PO4/CoFe2O4/GO exhibited higher degradation efficiency for MO compared with pure Ag3PO4. The enhanced photocatalytic performance of Ag3PO4/CoFe2O4/GO can be attributed to the effective separation of photoinduced electron-hole pairs. Radical-trapping experiments showed that holes and superoxide radicals were dominant radicals in the degradation process. According to the experimental results, a possible photocatalytic mechanism was also proposed. Furthermore, the Ag3PO4/CoFe2O4/GO composites can be easily separated from the reaction solution by an external magnet due to the existence of CoFe2O4. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Novel cathode material Bi1.91Sr2Co1.96O7.08 (BSCO) was synthesized by ethylene glycol assisted sol-gel method for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs). In addition to its good thermal stability, it shows chemical and thermal compatibility with Ce0.9Gd0.1O2 gamma electrolyte. Thermal expansion coefficient of BSCO is found to be approximately 11.2 x 10(-6) K-1 from 100 degrees C to 800 degrees C, which is the main merit of this material compared with other cobaltite based perovskite cathodes. Electrical conductivity of BSCO is about 8-9 S cm(-1) between 600 and 700 degrees C, and polarization resistance of BSCO cathode on Ce0.9Gd0.1O2 gamma electrolyte are 0.1, 0.3 and 1.3 Omega.cm(2) at 800, 748 and 695 degrees C, respectively. Maximum power density based on BSCO/GDC/NiO-GDC cell is 495 mW.cm(-2) at 700 degrees C. Given that the thermal compatibility with the electrolyte and the encouraging electrochemical performance, BSCO could be considered as an alternative cathode material for IT-SOFCs.

AB Au@ZnO core-shell nanorods with excellent thermostability and efficient photocatalytic activity were successfully prepared through a facile hydrothermal method. Morphology characterizations proved that the Au@ZnO nanorods exhibit stable core-shell nanostructure and its Au cores still maintained rod-like morphology after being treated at 500 degrees C. Extinction spectra revealed that thermostable Au@ZnO nanorods have preeminent absorption in ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared regions. Photocatalytic test indicated that Au@ZnO nanorods possess efficient photocatalytic activity for the degradation of Rhodamine B under visible-light irradiation. The high crystallinity of ZnO nanoshells and strong plasmon resonance of Au were thought to be the reason for the superior photocatalytic activity. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, the mechanical properties and fracture mechanisms of coarse-grained (CG) commercial-purity Ti subjected to both tensile and torsion deformations are investigated. During tensile deformation, CG Ti exhibits general excellent extendibility and ductile fracture. However, CG Ti presents absolutely brittle fracture during torsion deformation, despite its high torsion deformability. This is attributed to the specific fracture mechanism in torsion that the microcracks nucleate at the surface layer and propagate from the surface to the interior of torsion sample, which is contrast to the typical microcrack nucleation and propagation behaviors of ductile metals in tension. This study has an important significance for the design and application of metals carrying torsional load. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Cinnamon nanoparticles (CNPs) containing rich active agents of cinnamaldehyde and polyphenols are prospective for nanobiomedicine. They are preferred over metallic nanoparticles due to excellent bioactivity and non-toxicity. This paper reports the structural and emission properties of CNPs grown in citric acid medium (under varying laser energy) using pulse laser ablation in liquid (PLAL) technique. TEM analysis revealed the nucleation of crystalline truncated tetrahedral CNPs with average diameter approximate to 12.85 nm. EDX spectra detected the exact elemental constituents in protein capped CNPs. Raman spectra displayed the symmetric bonding vibration of CNPs in the presence of secondary metabolites enclosing terpenoids, flavonoids, phenols and tannins. Photoluminescence emission spectra disclosed two prominent peaks centered at 420 nm and 480 nm assigned to the occurrence of phenolic acids in CNPs. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Hierarchical porous silicate cements with lamellar/dendritic morphology were prepared by combination of ice-templating and hydration reaction routes. The macropores with multimodal pore distributions are found to be interconnected through intrinsic mesopores resulting from ice crystals growth and hydration products generation. As the slurry concentration increased from 40 to 60 wt%, the BET surface area decreased from 86.744 m(2) g (1) to 70.707 m(2) g (1), the porosity decreased from 61.8% to 47.62%, whilst the compressive strength increased from 10.76 Mpa to 16.67 Mpa. Low-cost starting material and eco-friendly technique probably endow ordered porous cement with potential in a variety of applications including membrane separation and adsorption process.

AB ZnO@BiOI nanocomposite has been prepared by a one-step calcination method and characterized by XRD, SEM and HRTEM. The photocatalytic activity of ZnO@BiOI nanocomposite was examined by the photooxidation of 1,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethylpyridine-3,5-dicarboxylate (1,4-DHP) under visible light irradiation (lambda > 400 nm). Compared with pure ZnO and BiOI, the photocatalytic activity of ZnO@BiOI was dramatically enhanced. In addition, the 1,4-DHP was quantitatively converted to its pyridine derivatives by the mild oxidation without deep oxidation or degradation. Mechanism study showed that superoxide anionic radicals (center dot O-2) and photogenerated holes (h(+)) were the major active species. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID TWEETS; TOPICS
AB Social media provides a medium for people to express themselves on different issues. Twitter has gained a lot of popularity in the past decade as a social media platform where people create micro-blogs providing a valuable data source to understand trends and public opinion. However, the volume of tweets even on specific topics may reach millions creating a big challenge for the analyst. Clustering is a technique which can be utilized to better understand such large volumes of data. The main idea of clustering is to group similar tweets into batches in order to find patterns, to summarize, and to compress a large dataset. Though clustering is a natural technique for the analysis of tweets, there is no clustering tool specifically designed for Twitter data that utilizes lexical and semantic similarities; and that can be readily used by non-technical experts such as social scientists. I-TWEC is a web based tweet clustering tool where users can upload their data and the resulting clusters are presented with different visualizations which further enable the user to interactively select and merge clusters based on their semantic similarity. I-TWEC has the lexical and semantic clustering components implemented as two consecutive phases. For the lexical clustering of tweets, Longest Common Subsequence is a widely accepted similarity metric, however it is also very costly, and therefore not applicable to large data sets such as the ones collected through Twitter. In order to overcome that challenge, we have implemented a suffix tree based index structure in I-TWEC to efficiently cluster tweets based on the Longest Common Substring similarity which is an approximation of the Longest Common Subsequence. Experiments we have conducted show that lexical clustering phase of I-TWEC can produce results with comparable clustering quality in a fraction of the time required by the baseline methods which use Longest Common Subsequence and Suffix Tree. We have also experimented with a k-means document clustering as well as a state-of-the-art word based suffix tree clustering algorithm and the results show that I-TWEC outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of time with comparable clustering quality.

ID LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; EXPERTS; MODEL; FRAMEWORK
AB In many real-world classification tasks, discriminative models are widely applied since they achieve good predictive scores. In this paper, we propose a generalized framework for the well-studied Hierarchical mixture of experts (HME) model. HME combines hierarchically several discriminative models through a set of input-dependent weights. We derive from our generalized framework, two models as examples of how we can reduce the number of experts used. Those two examples are based on the choice of the weights functions. We choose a Gaussian-based and a linear softmax as weights, restricting our study to a two-level tree. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our models can efficiently reduce the number of experts and outperform some state-of-art algorithms. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Concept drift is the problem that the statistical properties of the data generating process change over time. Recently, the Time Decaying Adaptive Prediction (TDAP) algorithm(1) was proposed to address the problem of concept drift. TDAP was designed to account for the effect of drifting concepts by discounting the contribution of previous learning examples using an exponentially decaying factor. The drawback of TDAP is that the rate of its decaying factor is required to be manually tuned. To address this drawback, we propose a new adaptive online algorithm, called Follow-the-Regularized-Leader with Adaptive Decaying Proximal (FTRL-ADP). There are two novelties in our approach. First, we derive a rule to automatically update the decaying rate, based on a rigorous theoretical analysis. Second, we use a concept drift detector to identify major drifts and reset the update rule accordingly. Comparative experiments with 14 datasets and 6 other online algorithms show that FTRL-ADP is most advantageous in noisy environments with real drifts. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is a single-hidden layer feedforward neural network (SLFN) learning algorithm that can learn effectively and quickly. The ELM training phase assigns the input weights and bias randomly and does not change them in the whole process. Although the network works well, the random weights in the input layer may affect the algorithm performance. Therefore, we propose a new approach to determine the input weights and bias for the ELM using the restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), which we call RBM-ELM. We compare our new approach to the well-known ELM-AE and to the ELM-RO, a state of the art algorithm to select the input weights for the ELM. The experimental results show that the RBM-ELM achieves a better performance than the ELM and outperforms the ELM-AE and ELM-RO. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we examine the ability of low-level multimodal features to extract movie similarity, in the context of a content-based movie recommendation approach. In particular, we demonstrate the extraction of multimodal representation models of movies, based on textual information from subtitles, as well as cues from the audio and visual channels. With regards to the textual domain, we emphasize our research in topic modeling of movies based on their subtitles, in order to extract topics that discriminate between movies. Regarding the visual domain, we focus on the extraction of semantically useful features that model camera movements, colors and faces, while for the audio domain we adopt simple classification aggregates based on pretrained models. The three domains are combined with static metadata (e.g. directors, actors) to prove that the content-based movie similarity procedure can be enhanced with low-level multimodal information. In order to demonstrate the proposed content representation approach, we have built a small dataset of 160 widely known movies. We assert movie similarities, as propagated by the individual modalities and fusion models, in the form of recommendation rankings. Extensive experimentation proves that all three low-level modalities (text, audio and visual) boost the performance of a content-based recommendation system, compared to the typical metadata-based content representation, by more than 50% relative increase. To our knowledge, this is the first approach that utilizes a wide range of features from all involved modalities, in order to enhance the performance of the content similarity estimation, compared to the metadata-based approaches.

AB Text representations is a key task for many natural language processing applications such as document classification, ranking, sentimental analysis and so on. The goal of it is to numerically represent the unstructured text documents so that they can be computed mathematically. Most of the existing methods leverage the power of deep learning to produce a representation of text. However, these models do not consider about the problem that text itself is usually semantically ambiguous and reflects limited information. Due to this reason, it is necessary to seek help from external knowledge base to better understand text.
   In this paper, we propose a novel framework named Text Concept Vector which leverages both the neural network and the knowledge base to produce a high quality representation of text. Formally, a raw text is primarily conceptualized and represented by a set of concepts through a large taxonomy knowledge base. After that, a neural network is used to transform the conceptualized text into a vector form which encodes both the semantic information and the concept information of the original text. We test our framework on both the sentence level task and the document level task. The experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of our work. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper we present PFDCMSS (Parallel Forward Decay Count-Min Space Saving) which, to the best of our knowledge, is the world first message-passing parallel algorithm for mining time-faded heavy hitters. The algorithm is a parallel version of the recently published FDCMSS (Forward Decay Count-Min Space Saving) sequential algorithm. We formally prove its correctness by showing that the underlying data structure, a sketch augmented with a Space Saving stream summary holding exactly two counters, is mergeable. Whilst mergeability of traditional sketches derives immediately from theory, we show that, instead, merging our augmented sketch is non trivial. Nonetheless, the resulting parallel algorithm is fast and simple to implement. The very large volumes of modern datasets in the context of Big Data present new challenges that current sequential algorithms can not cope with; on the contrary, parallel computing enables near real time processing of very large datasets, which are growing at an unprecedented scale. Our algorithm's implementation, taking advantage of the MPI (Message Passing Interface) library, is portable, reliable and provides cutting-edge performance. Extensive experimental results confirm that PFDCMSS retains the extreme accuracy and error bound provided by FDCMSS whilst providing excellent parallel scalability. Our contributions are three-fold: (i) we prove the non trivial mergeability of the augmented sketch used in the FDCMSS algorithm; (ii) we derive PFDCMSS, a novel message-passing parallel algorithm; (iii) we experimentally prove that PFDCMSS is extremely accurate and scalable, allowing near real time processing of large datasets. The result supports both casual users and seasoned, professional scientists working on expert and intelligent systems. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB There is a rich body of work dedicated to expert systems. However, none of them focus on control strategies suitable for distributed environments. We describe a novel approach to design distributed expert systems that is able to control rule activation; it involves control strategies supporting selective inferencing with rules that propagate concurrently and incorporates a set of meta-rules that operate on a blackboard and that are expressed as an assurance case. It is implemented on top of ERESYE, a tool for the realization of expert systems that is written in Erlang. We describe an implementation of the approach in an industrial setting, using an example focusing on the feature identification problem, whose resolution is an important task for source code maintenance and evolution.

AB Over the last few years, we have been witnessing a dramatic progress of deep learning in many real world applications. Deep learning concepts have been originated in the area of neural network and show a quantum leap in effective feature learning techniques such as auto-encoders, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks etc. In the case of kernel machines, there are several attempts to model learning machines that mimic deep neural networks. In this direction, Multilayer Kernel Machines (MKMs) was an attempt to build a kernel machine architecture with multiple layers of feature extraction. It composed of many layers of kernel PCA based feature extraction units with support vector machine having arc-cosine kernel as the final classifier. The other approaches like Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) and deep core vector machines solve the fixed kernel computation problem and scalability aspects of MKMs respectively. In addition to this, there are lot of avenues where the use of unsupervised MKL with both single and multilayer kernels in the multilayer feature extraction framework have to be evaluated. In this context, this paper attempts to build a scalable deep kernel machines with multiple layers of feature extraction. Each kernel PCA based feature extraction layer in this framework is modeled by the combination of both single and multilayer kernels in an unsupervised manner. Core vector machine with arc-cosine kernel is used as the final layer classifier which ensure the scalability in this model. The major contribution of this paper is a novel effort to build a deep structured kernel machine architecture similar to deep neural network architecture for classification. It opens up an extendable research avenue for researchers in deep learning based intelligent system leveraging the principles of kernel theory. Experiments show that the proposed method consistently improves the generalization performances of existing deep core vector machine. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The parameter-less population pyramid (P3) is a recent evolutionary computation algorithm proposed for black box optimization. Shown to be efficient for a variety of benchmark problems, P3 replaces the conventional constant population model with expanding sets of expanding populations. We investigated how this new metaheuristic optimization algorithm would transfer to optimize large-scale tower structure problems involving different constraints: geometric and mechanical. P3 is examined by optimizing two discrete tower design problems, 26-story and 35- story tower structures. The performance of P3 is compared with other well-known evolutionary algorithms for black-box optimization including random restart hill climbing, parameter-less hierarchical Bayesian optimization algorithm, differential evolution, and a modified genetic algorithm. The results show that does P3 not only finds the best final solutions, but it also reaches high quality solutions much faster than the other algorithms This fast optimization is vital for the tedious and large-scale structural engineering problems. Finally, the unique search features used in the P3 and the implications for future studies are discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Human cognition of the world generally begins with attribute perception of things. Knowledge element, which is able to reveal microscopic regularities by attribute network, provides an intelligent support for attribute-based cognition. In the field of emergency management, knowledge element has been widely used in evolution rules, risk analysis and machine learning based on emergency cases. However, since the knowledge of emergency management is multidisciplinary and in addition, limited by diverse cognitive perspectives and language expressions, integrating heterogeneous knowledge from domain experts and data sources for depth mining and decision support seems to be difficult. Especially, with the advent of big data, the problem of developing an efficient multi-attribute fusion method to reorganize complex and massive data in a consensual knowledge framework must be addressed. In this paper, a novel mathematical approach, which extends Dempster-Shafer theory to fuse combinatorial-type evidences, is elaborated to handle multi-attribute integration through the use of knowledge element model. This methodology makes it possible to establish a complete knowledge structure for attribute description of things by implementing new uncertainty measures to determine a degree of belief when combining evidences. It is meaningful to optimize the fusion algorithm in view of reliability and expansibility to some extent. Furthermore, the processing also has the advantage of being effective without any semantic preprocessing. The application of the proposed model is shown in marine disaster monitoring for emergency management. We make an empirical analysis in the attribute fusion of knowledge element "sea".

AB Categorical data clustering algorithms, in contrast to numerical ones, are still in their infancy despite some algorithms have been proposed in the literature. It is known that many clustering algorithms are posed as optimization problems, where internal cluster validity functions are utilized as the objectives to find the optimal partitions. However, most of these methods consider a single criterion that can merely be applied to detect the particular structure/distribution of data. To overcome this issue, in this paper, a novel many objective fuzzy centroids clustering algorithms is proposed for categorical data using reference point based non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm, which simultaneously optimizes several cluster validity indices. In our work, an effective fuzzy centroids algorithm is employed to design the proposed approach, which is different from other contestant k-modes-type methods. Here, the fuzzy memberships are used for chromosome representation that combines with a novel genetic operation to produce new solutions. Moreover, a variable-length encoding scheme is developed for the sake of finding the clusters without knowing any prior knowledge. Experiments on several data sets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over other state-of-the-art methods in terms of clustering accuracy and stability. On the other hand, our method can detect the cluster number if not predefined along with a desirable clustering solution. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Packing identical spheres occur in several commercial and industrial contexts, like automated radio surgical treatment planning and in materials science for studying the dynamic behavior of granular material systems. In this paper, a hybrid algorithm is proposed for approximately solving the identical sphere packing problem. Given a set of identical spheres and a large container (open or spherical container), the goal of the problem is to find a smallest container that contains all spheres without overlapping between spheres and between spheres and the container. The proposed algorithm combines both particle swarm optimization and an efficient continuous local optimization procedure. The swarm optimization generates a series of diversified populations of particles whereas the continuous optimization serves either to repair the infeasibility of solutions or improve their qualities. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated on a set of standard benchmark instances and its obtained results are compared to those reached by the more recent methods available in the literature. The experimental part shows that the proposed approach remains competitive, where it is able to reach 47 new upper bounds out of the 93 tested instances. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Frequent pattern mining is considered a key task to discover useful information. Despite the quality of solutions given by frequent pattern mining algorithms, most of them face the challenge of how to reduce the number of frequent patterns without information loss. Frequent itemset mining addresses this problem by discovering a reduced set of frequent itemsets, named closed frequent itemsets, from which the entire frequent pattern set can be recovered. However, for frequent similar pattern mining, where the number of patterns is even larger than for Frequent itemset mining, this problem has not been addressed yet. In this paper, we introduce the concept of closed frequent similar pattern mining to discover a reduced set of frequent similar patterns without information loss. Additionally, a novel closed frequent similar pattern mining algorithm, named CFSP-Miner, is proposed. The algorithm discovers frequent patterns by traversing a tree that contains all the closed frequent similar patterns. To do this efficiently, several lemmas to prune the search space are introduced and proven. The results show that CFSP-Miner is more efficient than the state-of-the-art frequent similar pattern mining algorithms, except in cases where the number of frequent similar patterns and closed frequent similar patterns are almost equal. However, CFSP-Miner is able to find the closed similar patterns, yielding a reduced size of the discovered frequent similar pattern set without information loss. Also, CFSP-Miner shows good scalability while maintaining an acceptable runtime performance. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study evaluates the efficiency of peripheral European domestic banks and examines the effects of bank-risk determinants on their performance over 2007-2014. Data Envelopment Analysis is utilised on a Malmquist Productivity Index in order to calculate the bank efficiency scores. Next, a Double Bootstrapped Truncated Regression is applied to obtain bias-corrected scores and examine whether changes in the financial conditions affect differently banks' efficiency levels. The analysis accounts for the sovereign debt crisis period and for different levels of financial development in the countries under study. Such an application in the respective European banking setting is unique. The proposed method also copes with common misspecification problems observed in regression models based on efficiency scores. The results have important policy implications for the Euro area, as they indicate the existence of a periphery efficiency meta-frontier. Liquidity and credit risk are found to negatively affect banks productivity, whereas capital and profit risk have a positive impact on their performance. The crisis period is found to augment these effects, while bank-risk variables affect more banks' efficiency when lower levels of financial development are observed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB With the penetration of Internet of things in manufacturing industry, it is an unavoidable issue to maintain robust wireless connections among machines and human workers in harsh industrial environments. However, the existing wireless planning tools focus on office environments, which are less harsh than industrial environments regarding shadowing effects of diverse obstacles. To fill this gap, this paper proposes an over-dimensioning (OD) model, which automates the decision making on deploying a robust industrial wireless local area network (IWLAN). This model creates two full coverage layers while minimizing the deployment cost, and guaranteeing a minimal separation distance between two access points (APs) to prevent APs that cover the same region from being simultaneously shadowed by an obstacle. Moreover, an empirical one-slope path loss model, which considers three-dimensional obstacle shadowing effects, is proposed for simple yet precise coverage calculation. To solve this OD model even at a large size, an efficient genetic algorithm based over-dimensioning (GAOD) algorithm is designed. Genetic operators, parallelism, and speedup measures are tailored to enable large-scale optimization. A greedy heuristic based over-dimensioning (GHOD) algorithm is further proposed, as a state-of-the-art heuristic benchmark algorithm. In small- and large-size OD problems based on industrial data, the GAOD was demonstrated to be 20%-25% more economical than benchmark algorithms for OD in the same environment. The effectiveness of GAOD was further experimentally validated with a real deployment system. Though this paper focuses on an IWLAN, the proposed GAOD can serve as a decision making tool for deploying other types of robust industrial wireless networks in terms of coverage, such as wireless sensor networks and radio-frequency identification (RFID) networks.

AB Project-based learning is based on the idea of iteratively learning for future projects from the successes and failures of past projects. This paper proposes a semi-automated implementation approach for double loop learning in project environments. A combined application of two complementary methods is suggested for this purpose: Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and Analytic Network Process (ANP). By this means, the approach addresses two problems of the project management practice. First, the information overload in project environments, whereby the LSA is used for the semi-automated extraction of lessons learned from large collections of textual project documentation. Second, the lack of procedures and methods for the practical implementation of available project knowledge, whereby the ANP is used for the systematic modeling of extracted lessons learned and their integration into the evaluation of project concepts and current project management routines. Thus, the proposed implementation approach improves the ability of project-based organizations to consequently learn from past failures or successes. From a practical perspective, evident shortcomings of existing computerized double-loop learning approaches are addressed. The proposed approach contributes to the project management practice not only by demonstrating a solution for the exploration of representative and potentially new lessons from multiple combined experience reports, but also by presenting a solution for the systematic assessment of such project governing variables and their mutual relationships as part of the decision-making in new projects. From a theoretical perspective, specific research avenues for further development of the double-loop learning concept by means of expert and intelligent systems are provided. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB With the rapid development of information technology, the capacity of Web images database becomes larger and larger. How to quickly and effectively find the desired images in Web image databases becomes the challenge needed to resolve with high priority. In this paper a novel diagonal texture structure descriptor (DTSD) is proposed, and a new framework considering hue, saturation and value components is utilized for image retrieval. In specific, we firstly use Otsu algorithm to segment image into foreground and background, and the features of multi-regions are respectively considered. That is, we present the contents of these multi-regions distinctively to reduce the influence of each other, which would perform hierarchical feature description and realize more accurate content match for image retrieval. In this study, to simulate the characteristic of human eyes for perceiving colors, hue and saturation components are quantized into various bins which can obtain more detailed description for color difference. Meanwhile, DTSD is extracted based on value component to represent the edge information as the feature of receptive field. Such a method can improve the spatial resolution ability of the descriptor, and identify finer structure of an image. Moreover, histogram with respect to these three components, i.e., hue, saturation and value, is utilized to generate the feature vector of an image. We carry out the experiments on benchmark Corel and UCID image datasets, and the extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves better performance in comparison with state of the art image retrieval algorithms. The proposed method is very promising, which can provide more accurate retrieved results on the basis of color & texture descriptions in multi-regions, and further enhances the performance of the intelligent image retrieval system.

AB This paper presents a new quantum chaotic cuckoo search algorithm (QCCS) for data clustering. Recent researches show the superiority of cuckoo search (CS) over traditional meta-heuristic algorithms for clustering problems. Unfortunately, all the cuckoos have identical search behaviours that may lead the algorithm to converge to local optima. Also, the convergence rate is sensitive to initial centroids seeds that are randomly generated.
   Therefore, the main contribution of this paper is to extend the CS capabilities using nonhomogeneous update inspired by the quantum theory in order to tackle the cuckoo search clustering problem in terms of global search ability. Also, the randomness at the beginning step is replaced by the chaotic map in order to make the search procedure more efficient and improve the convergence speed. In addition, an effective strategy is developed to well manage the boundaries.
   The experimental results on six famous real-life datasets show the significant superiority of the proposed QCCS over eight recent well known algorithms including, genetic quantum cuckoo search, hybrid cuckoo search and differential evolution, hybrid K-means and improved cuckoo search, standard cuckoo search, quantum particle swarm optimization, differential evolution, hybrid K-means chaotic particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithm for all benchmark datasets in terms of internal and external clustering quality.

ID EFFICIENT; ALGORITHM
AB Mining frequent itemsets (FIs) is an important problem in the field of data mining, and thus there have been many different methods proposed to solve this problem. However, mining FIs usually works on binary databases and has a limitation that is only concerned with the appearance of items regardless of their importance. In practical applications, items often have different importance depending on their values or meanings, and that leads to the emergence of weighted databases. In this paper, we propose a new method for mining frequent weighted itemsets (FWIs) from a weighted database by using the weighted N-list structure (WN-list), an extension of the N-list. Some theorems are proposed to calculate the weighted supports of itemsets fast, and then an algorithm is built based on these theorems for efficiently mining FWIs. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms existing methods, especially when run on very large and sparse databases. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Association rule hiding is the process of transforming a transaction database into a sanitized version to protect sensitive knowledge and patterns. The challenge is to minimize the side effects on the sanitized database. Many different sanitization algorithms have been proposed to reach this purpose. This article presents a structured analysis and categorization of the existing challenges and directions for state-of-the-art sanitization algorithms, with highlighting about their characteristics. Fifty-four scientific algorithms, primarily spanning the period 2001-2017, were analyzed and investigated in terms of four aspects including hiding strategy, sanitization technique, sanitization approach, and selection method. In terms of results and findings, this review showed that (i) in comparison to other aspects of sanitization algorithms, the transaction and item selection methods more significantly influence the optimality of hiding process, (ii) blocking technique increases the disclosure risk while distortion technique is better in knowledge protection field, and transaction deletion/insertion technique is a new direction, (iii) heuristic-based algorithms have attracted more attention than other algorithms, especially in the context of hiding the association rules, (iv) a new trend is to use evolutionary paradigm for knowledge hiding that is often integrated with the transaction deletion/insertion technique, and (V) hiding the association rules introduces more challenges than hiding the frequent itemsets in terms of the determination of strategy and formulation of the selection method. This study aims to help researchers and database administrators find recent developments in association rule hiding. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Since the community structure is able to reveal the potential law behind complex networks, mining hiding communities has gained particular attention from various applications. A variety of objective functions, such as Modularity, weighted clustering coefficient (WCC), etc., have been developed to characterize the cohesiveness of a community, and thus many community detection approaches are proposed by optimizing a predefined objective function. This paper offers a urgent study on how to integrate different objective functions into a generic framework, which aims to enhance the flexibility of expert systems that are designed to identify communities from complex networks. Specifically, we formulate the process of community detection as a strategic game and give a general form of utility function for each agent from the perspective of game theory. Furthermore, we prove that if the parameters in the generalized utility function can be specified carefully, the strategic game could well match a potential game and be able to converge to a pure Nash equilibrium. In addition, we choose some commonly used objective functions to match the generalized utility function and design a synchronous learning model to test the performance of different global models. Compared with existing approaches, experimental results on synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrate that the proposed model achieve higher accuracy and efficiency. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A Dynamic Manufacturing Network (DMN) is the manufacturing industry application of the Virtual Enterprise (VE) business model based on real time information sharing and process integration. DMNs are normally formed and supported by a collaborative platform previously designed and built by a preexisting strategic partnership. The collaborative platform forms and tracks each DMN through all phases of its life cycle which leads to the accumulation and storage of large historical datasets on partner and customer characteristics and actions. This data holds the key to customer and manufacturer behavioral patterns and performances that can further be used in the decision making processes.
   In this study, we have focused on tackling this widely neglected research opportunity, by integrating manufacturer, order and customer data and characteristics into DMN formation and planning. The developed big data analytics approach consists of TOPSIS, fuzzy inference system and multi objective optimization techniques. Initially, by integrating the TOPSIS multi criteria decision making technique with a fuzzy inference system (FIS) we have computed indices for Manufacturer reliability and Order priority. Then we developed a multi-objective mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model to generate efficient solutions minimizing cost and assigning more reliable manufacturers to orders with higher priority.

AB We present an intelligent system, based on the particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique, to solve a power consumption minimization problem which is commonly encountered at the industrial factories or workshops. The power minimization problem is concerned with adjusting the settings of a number of lighting devices in real time in a working environment, subject to the requirements of minimizing the power consumption of the lighting devices as well as producing sufficient illuminance over all the specified working spots in the working area. Usually, the search space involved is too huge and solving the problem with traditional methods, e.g., brute force or least squares, is out of the question. In this paper we describe a distributive-PSO (DPSO) based algorithm to solve the problem. We show that by dividing the whole population of particles into a number of groups, PSO can be done distributively on each group and the best settings for the lighting devices, which meet the requirements, can be efficiently obtained. DPSO is very suitable to be parallelized. Parallel implementations in GPU and Hadoop MapReduce are developed. Simulation results show that our developed system is effective for a variety of working environments. We believe our work facilitates developing an efficient tool for energy conservation as well as other optimization applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Disassembly sequence planning refers to the study of the sequential order of disassembly based on the limit attributes of parts in the process of disassembly after the product design. The present study proposes a new block-based genetic algorithm for disassembly sequence planning based upon the comparison of Kongar and Gupta's genetic algorithm and Dijkstra's algorithms. It is expected that the disassembly sequence planning problem can be solved more efficiently. Four examples are used to test the algorithms developed in this study. Finally, it shown that the quality of the solution generates met the expected effect. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Recent studies show a significant variation in antioxidant and antimicrobial properties between the various garlic genotypes mostly due to differences in chemical composition and bioactive compounds content. The aim of the present study was to evaluate antioxidant properties and antimicrobial activity of garlics collected from the main cultivation areas of Greece, as well as to correlate this activity with their total phenolics content. Genotype G5 showed the highest total phenolics content, which was significantly correlated with the lowest EC50 values for all the tested antioxidant activity assays. Antimicrobial activity was significant, especially against the bacteria Proteus mirabilis and Antibiotic resistant Escherichia coli. In conclusion, significant variation was observed between the studied garlic genotypes, indicating the importance of both growing conditions and genotype on bioactive properties of dry garlic bulbs. This variation could be further exploited in breeding programs in order to select elite genotypes with increased bioactive properties.

AB Lipases B from Candida antarctica (CALB), Rhizomucor miehei (RML) and Thermomyces lanuginosus (TLL) were immobilized on octadecyl methacylate (OM) or octadecyl methacrylate (OMC) beads. Their specific activity and regioselectivity were studied in the synthesis of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) partial glycerides, which presented nutraceutical properties.
   TLL derivatives were poor catalysts. Novozym (R) 435 was much better than Lipozyme (R) RM IM. RML activity (a GRAS enzyme) was modulated via immobilization. After only 3 h, OM-RML gave the highest CLA conversion (54% at 40 degrees C with 1:3M ratio of glycerol to CLA). OM-RML reduced by a factor of 3.12 and 1.16 the activation energy of the reaction with Lipozyme (R) RM IM and Novozym (R) 435, respectively.
   The new GRAS preparation OM-RML brings forth an optimal regioselective preparation of sn-1 mono and sn-1,3 diacylglycerols rich in CLA, with a ratio of sn-1,3/sn-1,2 regioisomers of 21.8, compared to 2.3 for Novozym (R) 435.

AB The effect of pre-cooked cheeses of different emulsifying conditions on the viscosities, mechanical properties, fat globules, and microstructure of processed cheese was investigated, and changes in protein network relating to the creaming effect and the occurrence of yielding point were discussed. The addition of pre-cooked cheeses with a short stirring time had no obvious impact on the fat globules and protein network. The random network brought low viscosities and a gradual increase in the fracture stress/strain curve. The addition of pre-cooked cheeses with the long stirring time caused protein network to become fine-stranded. The fine-stranded network caused creaming effect, and brought yielding points in the mechanical properties. The pre-cooked cheese with the small fat globules also caused fat globules to become smaller, and give the processed cheese more firmness. This study provides a potential solution to control the functional properties of processed cheese by using a variety of pre-cooked cheeses.

AB In the present study, 27 barley genotypes (Hordeum vulgare L.) grown in two geographic origins (Czech Republic and Spain) were analysed for their contents of beta-glucan, tocols and phenolic compounds (free and bound). The samples included hulled, hull-less and coloured genotypes. The results showed that concentrations of beta-glucan range from 2.40 to 7.42 g/100 g. Total tocol content of the barley samples ranged between 39.9 and 81.6 mu g/g. A total of 64 compounds were identified in the barley samples. These included 19 phenolic acids and aldehydes, 9 flavan 3-ols, 9 flavone glycosides, and 27 anthocyanins. The results showed a wide range of phenolic concentrations in the barley samples, highlighting the presence of considerable amounts of anthocyanins in purple barley genotypes. In synthesis, barley should be considered a good source of bioactive components, especially because of the broad spectrum of phytochemicals with potential health benefits besides the soluble fibre (beta-glucan).

AB Oven or microwave roasting and alginate encapsulation of pea flour and starch to produce novel pea ingredients for enrichment of slowly digestible starch (SDS) and resistant starch (RS) content in pea bread were investigated. Pea flour treated either by oven roasting (160 degrees C, 30 min) or by microwave roasting (1.1 kW, 6 min) effectively retained its low starch digestibility similar to its native form (similar to 25% SDS; similar to 60% RS). When oven roasting was applied to pea starch, SDS content increased triply compared to the fully boiled counterpart. Alginate encapsulation effectively controlled carbohydrate release to simulated gastric, intestinal and colonic fluids, and thus largely enriched the SDS and RS fractions in starch. Pea bread containing up to 37.5% of encapsulated roasted MPS pea starch not only provided high SDS and RS fractions (23.9% SDS and 30.2% RS) compared to a white bread control (0.2% SDS and 2.5% RS), but also provided an acceptable palatability.

AB This study investigated the effects of heating skim milk with soluble calcium salts, calcium chloride, calcium lactate, calcium gluconate and calcium lactobionate, on the physico-chemical and rheological properties of milk. Regardless of the type of salt added, the amount of casein in milk serum decreased and the amount of calcium in centrifuge sediment increased along with the serum calcium. The amount of calcium salt required for gelation and the gel firmness (G') varied depending on the salt. The a(Ca)(2+) order in milk was calcium chloride > calcium lactate > calcium gluconate > calcium lactobionate. With the same amount of added calcium salt, the final G' of milk gel followed the same order. The findings from this study suggest that the different association constants and formation of an intermediate calcium complex with hydroxycarboylate groups affected the calcium ion activity, which may influence the gelation properties in milk.

AB This study investigated the feasibility of using hyperspectral imaging for determining banana color (L*, a* and b*) and firmness as well as classifying ripe and unripe samples. The hyperspectral images at wavelengths 380-1023 nm were acquired. Partial least squares (PLS) models were built to predict color and firmness. Twowavelength combination method (lambda(i) - lambda(j)/lambda(i) + lambda(j), lambda(2)(i) - lambda(2)(j)/lambda(2)(i) + lambda(2)(j), lambda(i)/lambda(j) and lambda(i) - lambda(j))was used to identify the effective wavelengths. Based on the selected wavelengths, PLS models obtained good results with the coefficient of determination in prediction (R-p(2)) of 0.795 for L*, 0.972 for a*, 0.773 for b* and 0.760 for firmness. The corresponding residual predictive deviation (RPD) values were 2.234, 6.098, 2.119 and 2.062, respectively. The classification results of ripe and unripe samples were excellent in two different principal components spaces (PC1 + PC2 and PC1 + PC3). It indicated hyperspectral imaging can be used to non-destructively determine banana color and firmness as well as classify ripe and unripe samples.

AB The effect of ripening on the evolution of the volatomic pattern from endemic Vaccinium padifolium L. (Uveira) berries was investigated using headspace-solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME) followed by gas chromatography/quadrupole-mass spectrometry (GC-qMS) and multivariate statistical analysis (MVA). The most significant HS-SPME parameters, namely fibre polymer, ionic strength and extraction time, were optimized in order to improve extraction efficiency. Under optimal experimental conditions (DVB/CAR/PDMS fibre coating, 40 degrees C, 30 min extraction time and 5 g of sample amount), a total of 72 volatiles of different functionalities were isolated and identified. Terpenes followed by higher alcohols and esters were the predominant classes in the ripening stages -green, break and ripe. Although significant differences in the volatomic profiles at the three stages were obtained, cis-beta-ocimene (2.0-40.0%), trans-2-hexenol (2.4-19.4%), cis-3-hexenol (2.5.16.4%), beta-myrcene (1.9-13.8%), 1-hexanol (1.7-13.6%), 2-hexenal (0.7-8.0%), 2-heptanone (0.7-7.7%), and linalool (1.9-6.1%) were the main volatile compounds identified. Higher alcohols, carboxylic acids and ketones gradually increased during ripening, whereas monoterpenes significantly decreased. These trends were dominated by the higher alcohols (1-hexanol, cis-3-hexenol, trans-2-hexenol) and monoterpenes (beta-myrcene, cis-beta-ocimene and trans-beta-ocimene). Partial least squares regression (PLSR) revealed that ethyl caprylate (1.000), trans-geraniol (0.995), ethyl isovalerate (-0.994) and benzyl carbinol (0.993) are the key variables that most contributed to the successful differentiation of Uveira berries according to ripening stage. To the best of our knowledge, no study has carried out on the volatomic composition of berries from endemic Uveira.

AB A study with Pleurotus sajor-caju was conducted to: evaluate the nutritional and chemical composition of the fruiting bodies; optimize the preparation of bioactive phenolic extracts; and characterize the optimized extract in terms of bioactive compounds and properties. P. sajor-caju revealed an equilibrated nutritional composition with the presence of hydrophilic (sugars and organic acids) and lipophilic (tocopherols and PUFA) compounds. pHydroxybenzoic, p-coumaric and cinnamic acids were identified in the extract obtained with ethanol (30 g/l ratio) at 55 degrees C for 85 min. This extract showed antioxidant properties (mainly reducing power and lipid peroxidation inhibition), antibacterial activity against MRSA and MSSA and cytotoxicity against NCI-H460, MCF-7 and HeLa. Furthermore, as the extract showed capacity to inhibit NO production in Raw 264.7 macrophages, molecular docking studies were performed to provide insights into the anti-inflammatory mechanism of action, through COX-2 inhibition by the phenolic acids identified.

AB Now-a-days, there is an increased interest in fruits and vegetables processing by-products due to potential source of phytochemicals and pigments. Beetroot (Beta vulgaris) pomace extract is a rich source of betalain, phenolics and other bioactive components, which possess significant antioxidant activities. In the present study, process optimization was performed for developing ginger (Zingiber officinale) candy enriched with beetroot pomace extract using response surface methodology (RSM). The effect of two process variables: blanching time (0-10 min) and beetroot pomace extract (0-10%) was evaluated on physicochemical characteristics and phytochemicals content of the developed product. Maximum phytochemicals' activities were obtained under optimum conditions of 7.81 min blanching time and 9.24% beetroot pomace extract. FTIR analysis also confirmed the significant effect of beetroot pomace extract and it's blanching on the phytochemical potential of ginger candy. The study would be useful for developing similar novel and antioxidants rich food products supplemented with beetroot pomace extract.

AB A fast and simple analytical method was developed and characterized for the determination of aflatoxins (B-1, B-2, G(1) and G(2)) in rice. The procedure is based on a simple solid-liquid extraction without further clean-up, and analysis by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with fluorescence detection. Fluorescence emission of aflatoxins B-1 and G(1) was enhanced by post-column chemical derivatization using pyridinium bromide perbromide. The analytical method was satisfactorily characterized in white and brown rice. Under optimum conditions, external calibration in solvent could be used for quantification purposes and limits of quantification were below the maximum contents established by the European Union regulation for these contaminants/commodity group combination (0.07-0.14 mu g/kg for white rice and 0.20-0.28 mu g/kg for brown rice). Recovery studies carried out at three different concentration levels (0.5, 2 and 5 mu g/kg) showed values in the range of 84.5-105.3%, and RSDs= 5%.

AB Protein degradation is primarily responsible for postmortem meat tenderization, which might be affected by phosphorylation. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of phosphorylation on myofibrillar proteins degradation in muscle during postmortem. Here we modulated the phosphorylation status of protein by protein kinase inhibitor and phosphatase inhibitor, and the effect of these inhibitors on myofibrillar protein degradation was evaluated. Generally, myofibril fragmentation index of samples with lower phosphorylation level was higher. Troponin T and heat shock protein 27 were degraded faster in protein kinase inhibited ( low phosphorylation level) muscle, compared with the other two groups, while the degradation of desmin was not affected by inhibitors. Meanwhile, myosin heavy chain, actin and tropomyosin showed limited degradation in postmortem muscle. This study showed that dephosphorylation enhances the degradation of some myofibrillar proteins, indicating that protein phosphorylation may play an important role in postmortem meat tenderization.

AB A simple protocol is described for locating the site of action of an antioxidant (AO) in a micro-heterogeneous mixture, based on the pattern of the reactivity curve towards the AO of a series of 4-alkanoyl TEMPO radicals. The resulting cut-off curves yield information regarding the hydrophobic microenvironment surrounding the reactive AO group, and its accessibility by the probe. Convex curves are an indication of an AO located in a more hydrophilic environment, while concave plots originate from AOs in a more hydrophobic location in the microheterogeneous system.

AB Radiation processing of soybean, varying in seed coat colour, was carried out at dose levels of 0.25, 0.5 and 1 kGy to evaluate their potential anti-proliferative and cytoprotective effects in an in vitro cell culture system. Irradiated and control black (Kalitur) and yellow (DS9712) soybean extracts were characterized in terms of total phenolics, flavonoids and anthocyanins, especially cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G). Using an epithelial cell line, BEAS-2B the potential cytoprotective effects of soybean extracts were evaluated in terms of intracellular ROS levels and cell viability. The most relevant scavenging effect was found in Kalitur, with 78% decrease in ROS, which well correlated with a 33% increase in C3G after a 1 kGy dose. Results evidenced a correspondence between in vitro antioxidant activity and a potential health property of black soybean extracts, exemplifying the nutraceutical role of C3G. To our knowledge this study is the first report validating the cytoprotective effects of irradiated black soybean extracts.

AB Protein oxidation during chilling and frozen storage has recently attracted great attention due to its consequences on protein solubility and functionality. In this study, the effects of kappa-carrageenan oligosaccharides on myofibrillar protein oxidation in peeled shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) during frozen storage were investigated by assessing the content of the carbonyls, total sulfhydryl, dityrosine, and surface hydrophobicity. We also examined the means of antioxidant activity in vitro, degradation of muscle proteins, and integrity of tissue structure. Our data revealed that in vitro carrageenan oligosaccharides exhibited good capacities of OH center dot, O-2(-center dot), and DPPH center dot scavenging and Fe2+-chelating activity. Chemical analyses showed that frozen storage increased susceptibility of myofibrillar proteins to frozen oxidation. We found that the incorporation of carrageenan oligosaccharides during the treatment of the shrimp prior to frozen storage significantly decreased the formation of protein carbonyl and dityrosine, lowered the changes in myofibrillar surface hydrophobicity, and maintained a higher total sulfhydryl content when compared with the water-treated samples (control). Additionally, the results of protein degradation and tissue structure confirmed that these antioxidant oligosaccharides exhibited marked effects on stability of muscle proteins and effectively inhibited the degradation/oxidation of muscle proteins during frozen storage. Overall, the contribution of the antioxidant activities played an important role in cryoprotective effects of carrageenan oligosaccharides on frozen shrimp. Further application of these findings might maintain better quality and extend the commercialization of refrigerated products.

AB Delivery systems based on food-grade biopolymers are of particular interest for food applications. Here, we introduce a new calcium delivery system with a high calcium-binding capacity and controlled calcium release. The system integrates casein phosphopeptides (CPP) with soluble dietary fibers (SDF). The physicochemical properties, calcium-binding capacities, controlled calcium release properties and formation mechanisms of the prepared copolymers with different mass ratios of CPP/SDF after thermal treatment were studied. The results showed that CPP-SDF copolymers significantly improved the calcium binding capacity (P < .05) from 11.63% to 46.8% and increased the calcium phosphate deposition time. The SDF in copolymers protected CPP from gastric enzyme hydrolysis so that most of the calcium was released under intestinal conditions in a controlled manner. Structural characterizations demonstrated different copolymer conformational states, and more calcium- binding sites existed within the CPP-SDF copolymers. The results show that copolymers based on food-sourced polymers are potential candidates for oral calcium delivery.

AB This investigation demonstrates that the oxygen radical scavenging ability of rosemary leaf extract has significant seasonal variations. The scavenging ability of rosemary leaf extract was quantitatively evaluated for five active oxygen species by using the ESR spin-trapping method. It was found that leaves that were picked in the cold season showed higher scavenging ability than those picked in the warm season. Measurement of the scavenging rate in pure rosmarinic acid and caffeic acid indicated that the scavenging ability in the warm season was mainly derived from rosmarinic acid. In the boiled extract, rosmarinic acid decomposed into caffeic acid. Therefore, a marked increase in the scavenging ability against superoxide and singlet oxygen in the boiled extract is in line with the high activity of caffeic acid. This study demonstrates that the multiple free radical scavenging method can be a useful method in comparative antioxidant capacity studies of plant extracts.

AB Many infants and young children are fed nutritional milk formulas. Although products are commonly based on cow milk, goat milk provides an alternative. We directly compared digestion of cow and goat milk proteins, varying pH, enzyme concentrations and incubation times to simulate infant and young child gastric conditions. Protein digestion and peptide formation were evaluated using electrophoresis and chromatography. Digestion of higher molecular weight whey proteins increased with decreased pH and higher enzyme concentrations of young child gastric digestion conditions compared to infant conditions. beta-lactoglobulin was poorly digested under all gastric digestion conditions. Caseins reacted to pH changes differently compared to whey proteins, with less digestion of casein at pH 3.0 than at pH 5.0. Caseins from goat milk tended to be more efficiently digested compared to caseins from cow milk and peptide profiles from goat milk were distinct from cow milk.

AB The need for an analytical procedure for the identification of allergens present at trace levels in foods was highlighted by conflicting results in a case of contamination of the spice cumin. The application of a bottom-up proteomics experiment was investigated to identify marker peptides for potential contaminant nuts which could then be monitored with high specificity and sensitivity by selective reaction monitoring experiments. The method developed allowed for the distinction between two closely related Prunus species, almond and mahaleb, in two different spices, cumin and paprika. The paprika sample was found to be contaminated with almond and the cumin sample, contaminated at a much lower level, was found to be contaminated with mahaleb. The method could be applied to any protein-dense food matrix allergen so long as suitable control and reference samples can be acquired.

AB This work aims to investigate the effects of carbohydrate-hydrolysing enzymes on the release of phenolics in oat fermentation with Monascus anka. There were good correlations between phenolic content and a-amylase, xylanase and FPase activities. A high level of alpha-amylase activity (141.07 U/g) was observed, while xylanase (2.40 U/g), total cellulase (0.52 U/g) and beta-glucosidase activities (0.028 U/g) were relatively low in the fermentation system. The phenolic content of oat powder treated with crude enzyme from fermented oats significantly increased, especially that of the ferulic acid in the insoluble fraction and the vanillic acid in the soluble fraction. The surface SEM morphology of the oats showed that the cell wall structure was damaged by the crude enzyme treatment, which led to the release of phenolics. This study could provide metabolic understanding for optimization of phenolic compounds which could more efficiently increase the nutrition of oat intended for functional food ingredients.

AB A new micro-plate colorimetric assay was developed for rapid determination of zinc in animal feed, pet food and drinking water. Zinc ion was extracted from sample by trichloroacetic acid and then reacted with 2-(5-Bromo-2-pyridylazo)- 5-[N-propyl-N-(3-sulfopropyl) amino] phenol (5-Br-PAPS) to form a Zn-PAPS complex to be detected by a micro-plate reader at 552 nm. An ion masking formula including salicylaldoxime, deferoxamine and sodium citrate were screened and applied to exclude the interference from other heavy metals and a partitioning correction approach was proposed to eliminate the matrix effect derived from feed sample. The entire procedure can be completed within 40 min and the detection range was 0.038-8.0 mu gmL(-1) zinc in buffer solution. Moreover, the analysis in real samples revealed the consistency of results by this assay and those by atomic absorption spectrometry analysis. These features highlighted the possibility for this proposed assay to be used for rapid determination of zinc in complex samples.

AB A diet rich in phytochemicals confers benefits for health by reducing the risk of chronic diseases via regulation of oxidative stress and inflammation (OSI). For optimal protective bio-efficacy, the time required for phytochemicals and their metabolites to reach maximal plasma concentrations (T-max) should be synchronised with the time of increased OSI. A statistical model has been reported to predict Tmax of individual phytochemicals based on molecular mass and lipophilicity. We report the application of the model for predicting the absorption profile of an uncharacterised phytochemical mixture, herein referred to as the 'functional fingerprint'. First, chemical profiles of phytochemical extracts were acquired using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS), then the molecular features for respective components were used to predict their plasma absorption maximum, based on molecular mass and lipophilicity. This method of 'functional fingerprinting' of plant extracts represents a novel tool for understanding and optimising the health efficacy of plant extracts.

AB The bio-accessibility of phenolics, flavonoids, rutin, beta-carotene and lutein and changes in antioxidant activities in six edible greens during simulating gastro-intestinal conditions has been investigated. It was found that the amount of dialysable phenolics, flavonoids and carotenoids which potentially available for further uptake is varying depending on the leafy type. Bioavailable phenolics after the gastric-phase, intestinal-phase and in dialysable fraction were in the ranges of 13.9-71.8%, 14.4-77.4% and 3.1-12.3% respectively when compared with their fresh leaves. Total antioxidant capacities in the dialysable fractions were significantly lower than their original. Bioactives of Centella asiatica showed comparatively higher bioavailability in all phases with respect to its original content. beta-carotene seems more dialysable than lutein in all leaves studied. Higher rutin contents were found in both gastric and intestinal phases than in fresh leaves. These results highlighted that gastrointestinal digestion may substantially affect the absorption of polyphenols and carotenoids present in leafy greens.

AB Native acorn starch had high purity and the granules were mainly elliptical and spherical with the mean diameter of 7.32 mu m. Hydrothermal modifications slightly changed the morphology. The solubility, swelling properties and amylose leaching of acorn starch were mostly influenced by Heat-moisture treatment (HMT). XRD pattern of native starch (C-type) did not change on hydrothermal modifications, but native and annealing (ANN) modified starches showed the most crystallinity. DSC results showed that the gelatinization temperatures and enthalpy of native starch were 59.9, 71.3, and 80.6 degrees C and - 14.9 mJ/mg, respectively, and hydrothermal treatments generally increased the gelatinization temperatures. Regarding to RVA results, peak, breakdown, trough, setback, and final viscosities of native starch were 415, 143, 272, 168, and 440 RVU, respectively, and viscosity parameters of native starch were mainly more than those of hydrothermally modified starches. Generally, the intensity of the effects of hydrothermal modifications followed the order: HMT > dual modifications > ANN.

AB During a national monitoring plan, a pork fat sample was declared non-compliant for the sum of dioxins and PCB-DL (EU regulation). The National Reference Laboratory together with competent authorities conducted extended investigations to determine rapidly the contamination source at the farm level. A range of samples (n=129), representative of potential contamination sources, was selected for further characterization (fat, feed, materials, dust, soil) and was analyzed for PCDD/Fs and DL-PCBs by GC-HRMS. A hot spot was localized in the farm, which corresponded to a pre-feed storage tank, the paints of which presented huge DL-PCB concentrations (> 1x10(6) pg g(-1)), responsible for the contamination. The present case report describes a new source of PCB contamination, previously undescribed.

AB A method based on comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC x GC-TOF/MS) was developed to analyze steroidal compounds in vegetable oils, which could provide better separation and higher sensitivity than conventional one dimensional gas chromatography, and allowed determination of 31 sterols and triterpene alcohols in one injection. Furthermore, the approach also permitted separation and detection of small amounts of other compounds (may be steroidal compounds whose molecular structures have not been confirmed), which were obscured in the lower-resolution single-column technique. With the help of the GC x GC system, a more elaborate and complete information regarding the distributions and concentrations of free phytosterols and triterpene alcohols in safflower seed oil, soybean oil, rapeseed oil, sunflower seed oil and peanut oil were obtained. The proposed method could potentially open a new opportunity for the more in-depth knowledge of the steroidal compounds of vegetable oils.

AB Anthocyanins are potential food colorants due to their color, low toxicity and biological properties. However, the low chemical stability of anthocyanins has limited their use.
   In this work, the thermal stability of cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (cy3glc) (major blackberry anthocyanin) and blackberry purees through molecular inclusion with beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) was assessed. Complexation with beta-CD showed a thermal stabilization of cy3glc, resulting on a decrease of the degradation rate constant (k) and in several alterations in the cy3glc-beta-CD DSC thermogram. To assess the bioaccessibility of blackberry anthocyanins, the stability of blackberry purees through simulated in vitro digestion was also studied. Despite the rapid degradation of anthocyanins observed within the first minutes of simulated intestinal digestion, complexation with beta-CD allowed anthocyanins degradation to be slowed down. The results obtained demonstrate the ability of beta-CD to increase blackberry anthocyanins thermal stability and also to decrease the rate of degradation of these pigments under simulated gastrointestinal conditions.

AB In vitro studies have shown that vacuum frying may be an effective process to reduce starch digestibility as it may limit gelatinization; this is significant as overconsumption of starchy foods contributes to obesity and type 2 diabetes. Although in vitro studies are an instrumental tool, in vivo studies allow observation of the overall effect on a living organism. The aim of this research was to assess how in vivo starch digestibility can be reduced when frying under vacuum (9.9 kPa), after feeding Sprague-Dawley rats, while also understanding its relationship to in vitro starch digestibility. Results showed that vacuum-fried dough has a lower degree of gelatinization (similar to 53.8%) and a maximal blood glucose level at 60 min (slower glycemic response) than atmospheric counterparts (similar to 98.3% degree of gelatinization and maximal blood glucose level at 30 min). Similarly, in vitro procedures exhibited less rapidly available glucose and higher unavailable glucose fractions in vacuum-fried dough.

AB The dose-dependent effects of (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG; at 0, 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1000 mg/L) on the physical, chemical, and oxidative stability of porcine myofibrillar protein (MP)-soybean oil emulsion systems were investigated. The results showed EGCG at all levels effectively suppressed lipid oxidation in MP emulsion composite gels during the entire chill storage (at 4 degrees C for 0, 3, or 7 days). The incorporation of EGCG at higher concentrations (> 100 mg/L) promoted the loss of sulfhydryls, reduction of surface hydrophobicity, and aggregation and cross-linking of MP. As a result, high concentrations of EGCG (500 and 1000 mg/L) hampered emulsification and gel formation of MP. However, EGCG at lower concentrations (50-200 mg/L) improved the oxidative stability of meat emulsions without jeopardizing the textural stability.

AB Cold storage is an effective method used to retard the senescence of Nanguo pears after harvest. However, this causes aroma loss in the fruit. To elucidate the role of membrane lipid metabolism in aroma reduction, we investigated the contents of total aroma eaters and major fatty acid components, the membrane permeability, and the activity and gene expression of key enzymes in membrane lipid metabolism and aroma formation. The results showed that the contents of total aroma esters, oleic acid and linoleic acid, and alcohol dehydrogenase activity were at a lower level in cold stored fruit than that in control fruit. However, the palmitic acid content, membrane permeability, and the activities and gene expression of alcohol acyltransferase, lipoxygenase, phospholipase D, and lipase were higher. In conclusion, the loss of aroma esters may be caused by membrane lipid metabolism disruption during cold storage.

AB Numerous calcium sources are available to enrich food, but their behavior during digestion is still unknown. This study focused on the influence of the gastro-intestinal pH, the food structure and the calcium source on the bioaccessibility of the nutrient.
   Four calcium sources were studied: calcium carbonate, calcium citrate malate, calcium phosphate and calcium bisglycinate. These were added to dairy matrices, containing cream and whey proteins, of different forms (liquid or gel). The kinetics of solubility and ionic calcium concentration during in vitro digestion were studied, as function of gastro-intestinal pH.
   All calcium sources were almost fully soluble in the gastric compartment, and then became insoluble in the intestinal phase. The level of calcium insolubilisation in the intestinal phase was not significantly influenced by the matrix structure (liquid or gel), but was more dependent on the calcium source, this effect leading to different final calcium bioaccessibility from 36% to 20%.

AB Stability of enzymes is an important parameter for their industrial applicability. Here, we report successful immobilization of beta-amylase (bamyl) from peanut (Arachis hypogaea) onto Graphene oxide-carbon nanotube composite (GO-CNT), Graphene oxide nanosheets (GO) and Iron oxide nanoparticles (Fe3O4). The Box-Behnken Design of Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was used which optimized parameters affecting immobilization and gave 90%, 88% and 71% immobilization efficiency, respectively, for the above matrices. beta-Amylase immobilization onto GO-CNT (bamyl@GO-CNT) and Fe3O4 (bamyl@Fe3O4), resulted into approximately 70% retention of activity at 65 degrees C after 100 min of exposure. We used atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM), Fourier transformed infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and fluorescence microscopy for characterization of free and enzyme bound nanostructures (NS). Due to the nontoxic nature of immobilization matrices and simple but elegant immobilization procedure, these may have potential utility as industrial biocatalysts for production of maltose.

AB Soy protein hydrolyzate has been used as supplements in wheat flour to enhance the nutritional value of its products, but it may negatively affect the gluten properties simultaneously. In order to explore the mechanism of this effect, protein characteristics including disulfide bond, protein composition, intermolecular force of dough proteins, and atomic force microscope images of gluten were obtained. Results showed that disulfide bonds in dough increased when soy protein hydrolyzate was added, but glutenin macropolymer decreased. Atomic force microscope images showed that gluten were weakened by soy protein hydrolyzate. Based on these results, a model was developed to describe the interaction between soy protein hydrolyzates and wheat proteins: soy protein hydrolyzates linked with wheat proteins through disulfide bond, disrupted the glutenins polymerization, thus hindered gluten networks formation. The interaction between wheat proteins and soy protein hydrolyzates in noodle making dough could be described with this model reasonably.

AB Water-soluble Monascus yellow pigment (WSMYP) prepared from monascorubin is widely used in the food industry. However, the structure and composition of this pigment has been unclear until now. In the present study, the components of WSMYP has been identified by means of HPLC coupled with a photodiode-array detector (PAD) and an evaporative light scattering detector (ELSD), HPLC/ESI-MS-MS, and high resolution ESI-MS(HR-ESI-MS). Eight compounds have been separated from WSMYP and unambiguously structurally characterized; namely, monascin, ankaflavin and six novel compounds with molecular weights/structural formulae of 356/C21H24O5, 376/C21H28O6, 384/C23H28O5, 404/C23H32O6, 437/C21H27NO7S, and 465/C23H31NO7S. Compounds 3 (376/C21H28O6), 7 (437/C21H27NO7S), and 8(465/C23H31NO7S) are the main components in WSMYP with contents of 55.8%, 16.5%, and 10.1%, respectively. These results provide useful information for further bioactivity studies and industrial application of WSMYP.

AB The structures of soy protein isolate, beta-conglycinin, and glycinin at increasing succinylation levels (0-94.88%) were determined to control the formation of soy protein thermal aggregates. In addition, the thermal aggregation was investigated under various temperatures (70-100 degrees C) and ionic strengths (0-1.0 mol/L NaCl) at pH 7.0. Results showed that soy protein isolate, beta-conglycinin, and glycinin underwent obvious structural changes when their succinylation degrees reached around 60%, 30%, and 65%, respectively. After which, the acylation rates markedly declined. During succinylation, soy proteins, particularly glycinin, endured gradual damages in its secondary and tertiary structures. Consequently, the thermal stability of glycinin was reduced, whereas that of beta-conglycinin was hardly affected. However, as the colloid stability of succinylated soy protein isolate was enhanced significantly, its thermal aggregation was markedly suppressed. Thus, succinylation could be used to improve the stability of soy proteins after heating.

AB In the study, a simple, and efficient microextraction approach, which is termed as vortex-assisted ionic liquid-based dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (VA-IL-DLLME), was developed for flame atomic absorption spectrometric analysis of aluminum (Al) and chromium (Cr) in vegetables. The method is based on the formation of anionic chelate complexes of Al(III) and Cr(VI) with o-hydroxy azo dye, at pH 6.5, and then extraction of the hydrophobic ternary complexes formed in presence of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) into a 125 mu L volume of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluorosulfonyl) imide [C4mim][Tf2N]) as extraction solvent. Under optimum conditions, the detection limits were 0.02 mu g L-1 in linear working range of 0.07-100 mu g L-1 for Al(III), and 0.05 mu g L-1 in linear working range of 0.2-80 mu g L-1 for Cr(VI). After the validation by analysis of a certified reference material (CRM), the method was successfully applied to the determination of Al and Cr in vegetables using standard addition method.

AB Coffee bean extracts are consumed all over the world as beverage and there is a growing interest in coffee leaf extracts as food supplements. The wild diversity in Coffea (Rubiaceae) genus is large and could offer new opportunities and challenges. In the present work, a metabolomics approach was implemented to examine leaf chemical composition of 9 Coffea species grown in the same environmental conditions. Leaves were analyzed by LC-HRMS and a comprehensive statistical workflow was designed. It served for univariate hypothesis testing and multivariate modeling by PCA and partial PLS-DA on the Workflow4Metabolomics infrastructure. The first two axes of PCA and PLS-DA describes more than 40% of variances with good values of explained variances. This strategy permitted to investigate the metabolomics data and their relation with botanic and genetic informations. Finally, the identification of several key metabolites for the discrimination between species was further characterized.

AB In this study, 71 phenolic acids and their derivatives were used to investigate the structure-affinity relationship of beta-lactoglobulin binding, and the effect of this interaction on antioxidant activity. Based on a fluorescence quenching method, an improved mathematical model was adopted to calculate the binding constants, with a correction for the inner-filter effect. Hydroxylation at the 3-position increased the affinity of the phenolic acids for beta-lactoglobulin, while hydroxylation at the 2- or 4-positions had a negative effect. Complete methylation of all hydroxy groups, except at the 3-position, enhanced the binding affinity. Replacing the hydroxy groups with methyl groups at the 2-position also had a positive effect. Hydrogen bonding was one of the binding forces for the interaction. The antioxidant activity of phenolic acid-beta-lactoglobulin complexes was higher than that of phenolic acids alone. These findings provide an understanding of the structure-activity relationship of the interaction between beta-lactoglobulin and phenolic acids.

AB A simple, sensitive, accurate and affordable rapid detection of meat species authentication is urgently needed in food industry. In this study, a cross priming amplification (CPA) combining nucleic acid test strip (CPA-Strip) assay for rapid detection of mutton from meat mixture were developed and its feasibility was investigated. In an isothermal CPA system, cytochrome b (cytb) gene as target was amplified at 63 degrees C for 60 min. The nucleic acid strip was able to show the corresponding test line in the presence of target gens in 5 min. Non-targeting gene interference was not evident. The CPA-Strip has been applied for the detection of 0.1-100% mutton in a thermal treated meat mixtures with a detection limit of a detect limit of 1%. CPA-Strip assay would be a promising simple, rapid and sensitive method for identification of target species in raw and processed meat mixtures.

AB Antioxidant casein peptides were separated by SP-Sephadex C-25 and C 18 columns. The transepithelial transport and bioavailability including the transport ratio and the remaining ratios of antioxidant activity (RRAA) of these peptide absorbates, were then investigated using a Caco-2 cell monolayer. The results indicate that both the negatively charged peptide fractions (CF1, CF2 and CF3) and the more hydrophilic fraction (HF1) were mainly transported via PepT1 and paracellular routes. The positively charged fractions (CF4 and CF5) and hydrophobic fractions (HF2, HF3 and HF4) were transported via PepT1 and transcytosis. The strongly negatively charged and more hydrophobic fractions showed a higher transport ratio, which ranged from 9.5 to 12.5%; however, the transport ratio of positively charged and hydrophilic fractions ranged from 4.0 to 8.5%. The positively charged and hydrophilic fractions showed a higher RRAA.

AB A novel effervescence assisted dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction method based on cohesive floating organic drop has been developed for simultaneous determination of triazine herbicides and triazole fungicides in aqueous samples followed by ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography tandem a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. In this method, 1-undecanol as extractant was well dispersed by effervescence. In order to obtain relatively high extraction efficiency, the effects of salt, volume of effervescence mixture, volume of extraction solvent and temperature were investigated. Under the optimum conditions, the proposed method showed good linearity within the range of 0.05-10 mu g L-1 with correlation coefficients of 0.9987-0.9999. The recoveries of analytes were in the range of 72.4-101.5% with relative standard deviations ranging from 2.6% to 11.7%. The limits of detection were varied from 2.7 to 9.7 ng L-1. This method has been successfully used to simultaneously analyze triazine herbicides and triazole fungicides in surface waters and grape juice.

AB Effects of 0.1 mM melatonin (MT) on chilling injury (CI), membrane fatty acid content and phenolic metabolism in peach fruit were studied during storage at 1 degrees C for 28 days. MT treatment delayed the development of CI in peach fruit, as was illustrated by MT-treated fruit showing lower CI incidence, CI index and firmness loss than the control. MT treatment prevented membrane lipid peroxidation and contributed to maintaining a higher ratio of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids in peach fruit. MT treatment also stimulated the activities of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, shikimate dehydrogenase and phenylalanine ammonia lyase, but inhibited the activities of polyphenol oxidase and peroxidase. This would help in activating the accumulation of total phenolic and endogenous salicylic acid that might have a direct function in alleviation of CI. These results indicate that MT treatment can be an effective technique to reduce postharvest CI during low temperature storage of peach fruit.

AB The effect of regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) on fatty acids and their derived volatiles in 'Cabernet Sauvignon' grapes and wines was investigated during two growing seasons in the east foot of Mt. Helan, the semi-arid area. The vines received water with 60% (RDI-1), 70% (RDI-2), 80% (RDI-3), 100% (CK, traditional drip irrigation) of their estimated evapotranspiration (ETc) respectively. RDI treatments resulted in lower yield, berry weight and titratable acidity with higher total soluble solids. RDI-1 increased the content of unsaturated fatty acids in berries and decreased the level of alcohols and esters volatiles in wines. RDI-2 and RDI-3 enhanced 1-hexanol and esters in wines in comparison with CK. The concentrations of C-6 aroma compounds were closely correlated with unsaturated fatty acids (p < .05), especially linolenic acid and linoleic acid. The present results provided direct evidence and detailed data to explain the effect of RDI on grapes and wines composition regarding fatty acids and their derived volatiles.

AB Precursors to hydrogen sulfide (H2S), methanethiol (MeSH), ethanethiol (EtSH), and dimethyl sulfide (DMS) were assessed in wines post-bottling, and the percent yield of VSCs from each precursor determined. Cysteine (Cys) and glutathione (GSH) were associated with small increases in H2S concentrations, with a maximum yield of 0.18% and 1.3%, respectively. Greater yields of H2S were obtained from the combined Cys/GSH and copper treatments in white wine. Copper, acting on unknown precursors, was associated with large increases in H2S in Shiraz wines. Dimethyl disulfide and methyl thioacetate were important precursors to MeSH, and produced maximum yields of 72% and 33%, respectively. Ethyl thioacetate was a key precursor to EtSH, with a maximum yield of 39% obtained. Copper and pH were important in modulating MeSH and EtSH accumulation in wines. A maximum yield of 23% of DMS from S-methylmethionine was obtained, with dimethyl sulfoxide producing significantly less DMS with a maximum yield of only 9.4%.

AB In this study, a rapid and reliable pretreatment method called dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (DLLME) was developed for the determination of 4(5)-methylimidazole (4-MeI) in beverages. The clean-up samples were analyzed by a high performance liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (HPLC-MS/MS) using a reversed-phase C18 column (250 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 mu m). The matrix effects and the fault of DLLME operation were corrected by the isotope dilution technique. The developed method exhibited the limit of quantification (0.3 mu g L-1) and excellent linearity (R-2 = 0.999). In addition, the recovery values of 4-MeI in carbonated beverage were ranging from 102.60% to 113.22%, in soft drinks were ranging from 103.24% to 108.85%. The content 4-MeI was detected in thirteen beverage samples treated with DLLME and solid phase extraction method (SPE) (ranging from 6.4 to 165.5 mu g L-1). The consistent result of 4-MeI content detected by DLLME and SPE method concluded that the established method on the basis of DLLME was rapid, robust and accurate for the trace 4-MeI determination in beverages.

AB An analytical method to accurately determine the presence of four toxic elements (As, Cd, Hg, and Pb) in medicine food homologous (MFH) plants using inductively coupled plasma-tandem mass spectrometry (ICP-MS/MS) was established. Fifty common MFH plants from different regions of China were analyzed and the range of values of As, Cd, Hg, and Pb were determined to be 66.3-2978.6 ng g(-1), 13.5-8107.1 ng g(-1), 1.7-325.6 ng g(-1), and 61.4-11428.5 ng g(-1), respectively. According to the standards of Chinese Pharmacopoeia (CP) 2010, the excess standard rates of As, Cd, Hg, and Pb were 14%, 16%, 6%, and 18%, respectively. On the basis of the limits set by the Chinese National Standards (CNS) GB 2762-2012, the excess standard rates of As, Cd, Hg, and Pb were 44%, 20%, 12%, and 34%, respectively. Therefore, special attention should be paid to the potential risk posed by toxic element contamination in MFH plants.

AB Industrially the avocado pulp is exploited principally as oil and paste, generating a huge quantity of peel and seed as by-products. Avocado peel is a promising inexpensive candidate for recovery phenolic compounds. The aim of this work was to identify the bioactive compounds present in an extract of avocado peel obtained by a green extraction technique. Accelerated solvent extraction was performed using water and ethanol as extraction solvents. Liquid chromatography coupled to ultra-high-definition accurate-mass spectrometry was used in order to identify the bioactive compounds. A total of sixty-one compounds belonging to eleven families were identified. Procyanidins, flavonols, hydroxybenzoic and hydroxycinnamic acids were the most common compounds. A sum of thirty-five compounds has been identified here for the first time in avocado peel. These results confirm the potential of avocado peel as a source of bioactive ingredients for its use in the food, cosmetic or pharmaceutical sector.

AB In a previous work, we optimized and used a fast adiabatic C-13-INEPT (Insensitive Nuclei Enhanced by Polarization Transfer) experiment for the isotopomic analysis of olive oil samples, which allowed us quantifying individual fatty acids within triacylglycerols through multivariate linear regression models. The goal of this study was to validate these models and to evaluate the power of C-13-INEPT in the authentication of olive oils relative to gas chromatography (GC) and H-1 NMR. In this respect, a new set of olive oil samples was analyzed by these three techniques. The analytical variables thus obtained as well as their corresponding long-term repeatability were compared. As a result, the reliability of the fatty acid quantification models was proven and the best classification of olive oils according to the altitude of the olive grove and to the morphological aspect (color) of the olives was achieved by means of C-13-INEPT.

AB In this investigation, samples were treated by ultrasonic probe (20 kHz) at an intensity of 25 W cm(-2) for 20 or 40 min, followed by aging at 4 degrees C for 1, 3 and 7 d. Ultrasound treatment significantly increased myofibrillar fragmentation index (MFI) and decreased Warner-Bratzler shear force (WBSF) at 3 and 7 d of postmortem aging (P < .05). Ultrasound-treated samples showed significantly greater intensities of autolyzed 76 kDa subunits and the lower intensity of intact 80 kDa form compared to control at 1 d of storage (P < .05). Significant difference was found between semitendinosus (ST) samples treated for both 20 and 40 min (P < .05). Ultrasound treated samples showed increased proteolysis during the postmortem storage as reflected by an increased degradation of desmin and troponin-T. These results showed that ultrasound treatment could improve the tenderness of beef ST muscle through regulating the calpain activation and protein degradation during postmortem aging.

AB Yak milk fat products constitute the base of Qinghai-Tibetan pastoralists' daily food intake. Despite the great importance of fat in processing and pastoralists' health, studies about yak milk fat are scarce. In this study, the lipid composition and the morphological properties of milk fat globule membranes (MFGMs) of yak milk were investigated. The results demonstrated that the yak milk had a higher cholesterol and sphingomyelin content compared to cow milk. In situ structural investigations performed at 25 degrees C by confocal microscopy showed the presence of lipid domains in yak MFGM, with a larger number and wider size range compared to cow milk. Moreover, the simultaneous localization of glycosylated molecules and polar lipids indicated that glycosylated molecules could be integrated into the lipid domains in yak MFGM. Different characteristics in yak MFGM could be related to the lipid composition and may affect the functions of yak milk lipids during processing and digestion.

AB Amino acids exert characteristic antioxidant activities depending on the properties of their side residues. The hydrophobic residues were effective against peroxyl radical, while acidic residues and their analogs were effective against peroxynitrite. Peptides containing tyrosine showed different activities against different reactive oxygen species (ROS) and/or reactive nitrogen species (RNS). The number and position of tyrosine did not affect the antioxidant activity against hypochlorite ion. Against the peroxyl radical, the number of tyrosine residues affected the antioxidant activity, while its position did not have a significant effect. The tyrosine position was an important factor for the antioxidant activity against peroxynitrite. The peptide GWWW showed higher antioxidant activity against peroxyl radical than tryptophan at concentrations below 25 mu M, and high activity against peroxynitrite at 250 mu M. Our results suggest that antioxidant peptides against a specific target ROS or RNS can be designed based on the characteristics of the amino acid side chains.

AB This work was designed as a proof of concept, to demonstrate the successful use of the comparison between theoretical and experimental collision cross section (CCS) values to support the identification of isomeric forms. To this purpose, thirteen mycotoxins were considered and analyzed using drift time ion mobility mass spectrometry. A good linear correlation (r(2) = 0.962) between theoretical and experimental CCS was found. The average Delta CCS was 3.2%, fully consistent with the acceptability threshold value commonly set at 5%. The agreement between theoretical and experimental CCS obtained for mycotoxin glucuronides suggested the potential of the CCS matching in supporting the annotation procedure.

AB Sugarcane bagasse (SCB) hydrolysate could be an interesting source for red pigment production by Monascus ruber Tieghem IOC 2225. The influence of different wavelength of light-emitting diode (LED) at 250 mu mol. m(-2). s(-1) of photon flux density on red pigment production by M. ruber in glucose-based medium was evaluated. Then, SCB hydrolysate was used as carbon source under the previously selected light incidence conditions. In glucose-based medium, the highest pigment production was achieved in fermentation assisted with orange LED light (8.28 UA(490nm)), white light (8.26 UA(490nm)) and under dark condition (7.45 UA(490nm)). By using SCB hydrolysate-based medium, the highest red pigment production (18.71 AU(490nm)) was achieved under dark condition and the glucose and cellobiose present in the hydrolysate were metabolized. SCB enzymatic hydrolysate was demonstrated to be a promising carbon source for high thermal stability red pigment production (activation energy of 10.5 kcal. mol(-1)), turning an interesting alternative for implementation in biorefineries.

AB Although water stress reduces fruit yield, it also increases capsaicinoid accumulation in hot pepper. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of different water regimes on capsaicinoid production in Capsicum chinense Jacq. having different pungency levels. Four hot pepper (C. chinense) cultivars were planted with four water regimes after anthesis: daily irrigation (control; S1), every 2 days (S2), every 3 days (S3) and every 4 days (S4). The results found that Akanee Pirote with the S2 treatment gave the highest capsaicinoid yield, and the increase of capsaicinoid yield was attributed from increasing the absolute capsaicinoid content and reducing the dry fruit yield as compared to the control. Capsaicinoid yield of Bhut Jolokia, Orange Habanero, and BGH1719 responded to the water stresses, but produced less capsaicinoid yield as compared to the control. This study reveals that appropriate water stress could increase capsaicinoid yield in some, but not all, hot pepper cultivars.

AB The research aims to study phospholipids (PL) classes and molecular species of large yellow croaker (Pseudosciaena crocea) roe. Both gas chromatographymass spectroscopy (GC-MS) and high-performance liquid chromatography with evaporative light-scattering detection (HPLC-ELSD) were utilized to analyze and identify the PLs fatty acids compositions and classes in the P. crocea roe, respectively. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22:6) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, C20:5) account for 35.0% and 6.9% of the PLs. Phosphatidylcholines (PC), lysophosphatidylcholines (LPC), phosphatidylethanolamines (PE) and phosphatidylinositols (PI) account for 76.36 +/- 0.62%, 12.30 +/- 0.55%, 9.12 +/- 0.02% and 1.09 +/- 0.01% of the total PLs, respectively. In addition, the PLs molecular species were characterized by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-quadruple-time of flight-mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS). A total of 92 PLs molecular species was identified, including 49 PCs, 13 PEs, 10 phosphatidic acids (PAs), 13 phosphatidylserines (PSs), 3 phosphatidylglycerols (PGs), 2 sphingomyelins (SMs), and 2 PIs of the P. crocea roe.

AB Molecular food traceability requires continuous updates to identify more robust, efficient and affordable methodologies to guarantee food quality and safety and especially consumers' health. Available commercial kits are often unsatisfactory and require modifications to successfully detect single components on complex and transformed food matrices. Here we report a simple method for molecular traceability of cold-pressed hazelnut oil based on microsatellite DNA markers. Different genomic extraction methodologies were tested and a total genome pre-amplification step was applied on PCR-negative samples. PCR-capillary electrophoresis using nine microsatellites demonstrates the accuracy of the fingerprint analysis even for filtered oil.

Thereafter samples were allowed to ripen for five days at 25 +/- 2 degrees C. The quality of guava was analyzed at an interval of 7, 21, 35 and 40 days. The coating applications resulted in lower activity of PPO & POD, higher DPPH radical scavenging activity, higher retention of ascorbic acid, phenol & flavonoid content, exhibited slower rise of reducing and total sugar in guava pulp. Samples in treatment B and D were the best formulations for extending shelf-life of guava up to 40 days versus seven days of uncoated samples.

AB In this study, an artichoke stem powder (ASP) was used at three concentrations (3%, 6% and 9%) in the formulation of new breads. The bioaccessibility of polyphenols and cynaropicrin from the ASP-enriched breads was evaluated in vitro by using a digestion model combined to high resolution mass spectrometry analysis. The overall total antioxidant capacity of the bioaccessible and unsolubilized fractions obtained during the intestinal steps and the potential ability to modulate alpha-glucosidase activity were tested. Data showed that 82% of totally bioaccessible polyphenols and 74% of cynaropicrin were released during the duodenal digestion whereas 88% of caffeic acid was released in the colon step. The antioxidant capacity and the alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity of the duodenal extract correlated with the amount of ASP in the bread. Data demonstrated that ASP might be a valuable functional ingredient to create a reducing environment in the intestine and to partially modulate glucose metabolism.

AB Mushroom extracts contain bioactive compounds potentially useful to functionalize foodstuffs. Herein, alcoholic extracts of Agaricus bisporus were studied for their bioactivity and viability as functional ingredients in a food product with high water content (yogurt). Extracts were microencapsulated (to improve their stability and hydrophilicity) by spray-drying, using maltodextrin crosslinked with citric acid as encapsulating material. The effect of thermal treatment (after atomization) on crosslinking and bioactivity of microspheres was tested. The incorporation of free and thermally untreated forms resulted in yogurts with higher initial antioxidant activity (EC50 values: 214 and 272 mg.mL(-1)) that decreased after 7 days (EC50 values: 248 and 314 mg.mL(-1)). Contrarily, thermally treated microencapsulated extracts showed higher antioxidant activity after the same period (EC50 values, 0 days: 106 mg.mL(-1); 7 days: 48.7 mg.mL(-1)), in result of an effective protection provided by microencapsulation with crosslinked maltodextrin and citric acid. Functionalized yogurts showed an overall maintenance of nutritional properties.

AB The aims of this research were to investigate if pulsed electric field (PEF) treatments caused cellular/structural alterations in Oxalis tuberosa (oca) tubers and if PEF treatment could reduce tuber oxalate levels. Whole oca tubers were treated with PEF at different electric field strengths up to 1.2 kV/cm. PEF treatments above 0.5 kV/cm caused tubers to soften, but differences in the electrical properties of the tuber tissues led to an uneven PEF effect with the tuber inner cores softening more than the middle regions. Cell viability tests confirmed the unevenness of the PEF effect, however PEF caused no changes in overall tuber/tissue structure. Even at high electric field strengths the cell remained largely intact and most starch grains were retained within the cells. Despite the retention of starch, PEF treatment reduced tuber oxalate contents by almost 50% in some tissues and could potentially aid the development of low oxalate oca-based foods.

AB The selection of an appropriate Cynara cardunculus flowers batch is a preliminary step to produce rennet with better clotting properties. For this reason, we proposed to study the influence of the ripening stage and the lyophilization of cardoon flowers on their chemical composition, enzymatic activities of extracts, and technological properties of cheese curds. Results of flowers composition have shown that lyophilized flowers harvested at the middle of ripening stage (A) could be employed to produce mainly proteins or milk-clotting proteases. To confirm this, enzymatic activities of extracts and technological properties of curds were assessed. The experimental findings revealed that flowers lyophilization seems to be an efficient way to produce rennet with better clotting properties, leading to higher yield, moisture, and texture parameters of curd. These findings allowed us to select lyophilized flowers (A) for further cheese making process.

AB The development of sensitive, easy and reliable methods for the determination of Rhizomucor pusillus rennin (MPR) activity, in free and in immobilized form, along with the elucidation of the mechanism of action, represent challenges for the widespread use of the enzyme in industrial cheese production. These could be accomplished by using highly specific and sensitive substrates, as well as direct assay methods. We designed and synthesized novel substrates based on Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) for the MPR by employing computational simulation techniques and peptide synthesis in liquid phase. Three FRET-substrates (Abz-GFY-pNA, Abz-SFY-pNA and Abz-GFI-pNA) were found active, while the Abz-GFY-pNA showed the highest reliability, sensitivity and specificity among them. Subsequently, a novel mechanism of MPR action was elucidated, with the development of novel methods for assaying activity in free and immobilized form, which both may contribute in the wider use of rennin in cheese production and other biotechnological applications.

AB Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are essential to human health and can be produced by enzymatic esterification. Actinomadura sediminis UTMC 2870 isolated from oil-contaminated soil contained a lipase that was stable at varying pH and in various solvents, salts, and chemicals. This lipase exhibited high efficiency for omega-3 (n-3), and its production was optimized using a response surface method. Acylglycerols (AGs) rich in n-3 were produced by extraction of the free fatty acids (FFAs) from flaxseed oil, concentration of PUFAs, and enzymatic esterification by the Celite-immobilized lipase. The resulting product contained 50% (w/w) PUFAs, including 42% (w/w) alpha-linolenic and 9.7% (w/w) linoleic acid. The n-6/n-3 ratio in the product was 0.24, which differed markedly from the high values for this ratio in seed oils. Therefore, the A. sediminis lipase appears to be a good candidate enzyme for ester synthesis and especially for production of n-3-rich AGs for food industries.

AB Tomato juice and paste are special type of dispersions, composed of suspended particles (pulp) dispersed in a colloidal liquid medium (serum). The bright red appearance of soluble solid separated by high speed centrifugation denoted the presence of lycopene in this fraction. Since lycopene is a hydrophobic compound it is not expected to appear in the water soluble fraction. HPLC analysis indicated presence of substantial amount of lycopene in soluble fraction which was confirmed by the appearance of lycopene crystals when observed under Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM). Considerable amount of pectin in the soluble fraction led to hypothesis that pectin facilitated the formation of hydrocolloidal system of suspended lycopene during processing. Enzyme treatment confirmed this hypothesis when pectinase effectively disrupted colloidal system and precipitated lycopene. Necessity of the divalent ions to retain the suspension signified the electrostatic interactions in the matrix surrounding lycopene crystals.

AB Feruloylated oligosaccharides (FOs) have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for addition to baked goods. This work investigated the effect of FOs on the formation of endogenous contaminants, antioxidant properties, appearance and texture of biscuits. FOs inhibited the formation of fluorescent AGEs (advanced glycation end-products), protein oxidation products, and dicarbonyl compounds in a dose-dependent manner. Addition of 10 mg/g FOs decreased the levels of fluorescent AGEs, dityrosine, kynurenine, N'-formylkynurenine, 3-deoxyglucosone, glyoxal, and methylglyoxal by 80%, 97%, 56%, 86%, 46%, 54% and 62%, respectively. FOs might inhibit the formation of alpha-dicarbonyl compounds, protein oxidative products and fluorescent AGEs by enhancing antioxidant capacity and releasing ferulic acid in baked biscuits. However, FOs increased the browning and hardness of biscuits in a dose-dependent manner. Therefore, the fortification of FOs should be carefully considered based on both the expected health promoting properties and the organoleptic profile of biscuit products.

AB Feed sustainability is one of the biggest challenges for the next few years. Solutions have to be found that take feed quality and safety into account. Animal by-products are one valuable source of proteins. However, since the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) crisis, their use has been strictly regulated. The objective of this study was to propose a routine, sensitive and specific method using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry for the detection of blood-derived products and milk powder in feed. Contaminated aquafeeds were analysed in order to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the method. This new method meets both selectivity and sensitivity (0.1% (w/w)) requirements imposed by the European Commission for animal proteins detection methods. It offers an innovative and complementary solution for the simultaneously identification of authorised and unauthorised animal by-products such as processed animal proteins (PAPs).

AB The lichen Cetraria islandica or Iceland Moss is commonly consumed as tea, food ingredients (e.g. in soup or bread) and herbal medicines. C. islandica, which has two chemotypes, can be difficult to distinguish from the sister species Cetraria ericetorum. They are collectively referred to as the Cetraria islandica species complex. This study aimed to use an UPLC-QToF-MS chemical profiling together with DNA barcoding to distinguish species and chemotypes of the C. islandica species complex. Our results show that the two chemotypes of C. islandica are clearly distinguishable from each other and from C. ericetorum by the chemometric approach. The RPB2 barcode was able to differentiate C. islandica from C. ericetorum with a barcode gap, but the widely used nrITS barcode failed. Neither of them could discriminate chemotypes of C. islandica. In conclusion, this integrative approach involving chemical profiling and DNA barcoding could be applied for authentication of Iceland Moss materials.

AB Graphene oxide wrapped silica nanocomposites were synthesized and selected as solid phase extraction adsorbents for high performance liquid chromatography analysis of aflatoxins. The major parameters affecting extraction efficiency were optimized, including the amount of adsorbents, extraction time and desorption conditions. The limit of detections and the limit of quantifications were from 0.1 to 0.3 mu g/kg and from 0.3 to 1.0 mu g/kg, respectively. The recoveries of aflatoxins in the spiked maize and rice samples were in the range of 76.8-104.7% and 81.1-106.9%, respectively, and with the RSDs less than 12.4%. The proposed method was proven to be simple, rapid and reliable for routine analysis of aflatoxins in crops.

AB A wide range of compounds can be formed during thermal processing of food, some of which are relevant for aroma (e.g., furfural), while others are of great health concern (e.g., furan). This paper presents the study of formulation as affecting the simultaneous generation of furan and furfural, along with other aroma quality markers, in sponge cake by means of headspace trap/GC-MS. Ingredients were screened according to their category (fat, salt, sugar, egg-based). Glucose-containing formulation resulted in the highest content of furan and furfural (12.5 +/- 0.5 ng g(-1) and 9.2 +/- 0.2 mu g g(-1), dry basis, respectively), while their lowest amount was found in the egg-white recipe (3.1 +/- 0.1 ng g(-1) for furan and 0.287 +/- 0.078 mu g g(-1) for furfural, dry basis). The latter also related negatively to all studied compounds. This work will be useful for developing novel strategies to deliver safe foods with appealing organoleptic attributes.

AB DNA-based methods have been gaining recognition as a tool for botanical authentication in herbal medicine; however, their application in processed botanical materials is challenging due to the low quality and quantity of DNA left after extensive manufacturing processes. The low amount of DNA recovered from processed materials, especially extracts, is "invisible" by current technology, which has casted doubt on the presence of amplifiable botanical DNA. A method using adapter-ligation and PCR amplification was successfully applied to visualize the "invisible" DNA in botanical extracts. The size of the "invisible" DNA fragments in botanical extracts was around 20-220 bp compared to fragments of around 600 bp for the more easily visualized DNA in botanical powders. This technique is the first to allow characterization and visualization of small fragments of DNA in processed botanical materials and will provide key information to guide the development of appropriate DNA-based botanical authentication methods in the future.

AB Sensory (cup) analysis is a reliable methodology for green coffee quality evaluation, but faces barriers when applied to commercial roasted coffees due to lack of information on roasting conditions. The aim of this study was to examine the potential of mid-infrared spectroscopy for predicting cup quality of arabica coffees of different roasting degrees. PCA analysis showed separation of arabica and robusta. A two-level PLS-DA Hierarchical strategy was employed, with coffee being classified as high or low quality in the first level and then separated according to cup quality in the second level. Validation results showed that the second level models exhibited 100% sensitivity and specificity in the training sets. For the test set, sensitivity ranged from 67% (rio zona) to 100% (soft) while specificity ranged from 71% (rio) to 100% (rioysh, hard). Thus, the proposed method can be used for the quality evaluation of arabica coffees regardless of roasting conditions.

AB This study prepared and investigated the inclusion complexes of propyl gallate (PG) with beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) and its water-soluble derivatives dimethyl-beta-cyclodextrin (DM-beta-CD), hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HP-beta-CD), and sulfobutylether-beta-cyclodextrin (SBE-beta-CD). Phase solubility studies indicated that the formed complexes were in 1: 1 stoichiometry. FT-IR, PXRD, DSC, H-1-NMR, ROESY-NMR, and SEM analysis results confirmed the formation of the complexes. The NMR results indicated that the aromatic ring of PG was embedded into the CD cavity. The aqueous solubility of PG was markedly improved, and that of the PG/DM-beta-CD complex increased by 365.3 times. In addition, the results of the antioxidant activity assay showed that the hydroxyl radical and superoxide radical scavenging capacities of the complexes increased by 3-11 times and 1-6.5 times, respectively, compared with those of PG under the same concentration. Therefore, CD/PG inclusion complexes with improved solubility and radical scavenging capacity can be used as water-soluble antioxidants in the food industry.

AB Skim milk was pH-adjusted from 6.6 to 7.5, high heat treated (HHT, 95 degrees C x 2 min) or held unheated for 1 h, readjusted to pH 6.6, and analysed. HHT at pH 6.6 resulted in denaturation of similar to 67% of total whey protein, partial association of denatured whey protein with the casein micelle, an increase in casein micelle size, and reductions in concentrations of serum casein, Ca and P. These changes were paralleled by a marked deterioration in rennet coagulability, higher ethanol stability in the pH range of 6.2-6.6 (P < .05), and a reduction in the pH of maximum heat coagulation time (HCT) (P < .05). Increasing the pH before heat treatment led to increases in casein dissociation and the concentrations of kappa-casein and denatured whey protein in the serum, and a reduction in casein micelle size (P < .05). Simultaneously, HCT at pH 6.6-6.7 and 7.2 increased significantly.

AB The effects of olive ripeness, areas of production and their interaction on the chemical and sensory characteristics of cv. Bosana oil were assessed. The study was carried out in three areas of the Sassari province, Sardinia (Italy), at three stages of maturation. The results indicated the independence of the two factors: ripeness influenced saturated fatty acids, pigment content and deacetoxy oleuropein aglycone (DAOA) content and didn't affect the sensory characteristics, while production area influenced unsaturated fatty acids, content of vanillic acid and some sensory characters. In order to verify the interdependency of the two factors, statistical analyses (two-way ANOVA) were performed. Our study showed that a thoughtful planning of harvest times and production area could allow to obtain Bosana virgin olive oil of the highest quality. Furthermore, utilizing cultivars that maintain the properties of their oils even at late dates of harvest, it would be possible to optimize harvest times.

AB The radiolytic decomposition of glucose, fructose, sucrose, ascorbic acid (H(2)A) and dehydroascorbic acid (DHAA), induced by ionizing radiation, was investigated. Aqueous solutions of these compounds were gamma-irradiated at doses of 0.5, 0.7 and 1 kGy, with a dose rate of 0.04 kGy/min, in the presence of air, followed by HPLC, HPLC-MS, EPR, and UV-VIS spectroscopy analysis of the resulting mixtures. Carboxylic acids, 2-furaldehyde, 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furaldehyde, furfuryl alcohol, 2-furoic acid and 2(5H)-furanone were identified in solutions of sugars and vitamin C, by comparing with standards. EPR studies exhibited a higher amount of free radicals for fructose than the other sugars, and more for DHAA than H2A. Additionally, spectroscopic determinations showed a typical UV-VIS absorption for furans during the storage of irradiated solutions. Formation and decomposition routes for furanoids and aliphatic carboxylic acids, and mechanistic pathways for the radiolytic induced rupture of glucose, fructose, sucrose and vitamin C have been proposed.

AB Edible seaweeds are valuable because of their organoleptic properties and complex polysaccharide content. A study was conducted to investigate the potential of dried edible seaweed extracts, its potential phenolic compounds and alginates for alpha-amylase inhibitory effects. The kinetics of inhibition was assessed in comparison with acarbose. The methanol extract of Laminaria digitata and the acetone extract of Undaria pinnatifida showed inhibitory activity against alpha-amylase, IC50 0.74 +/- 0.02 mg/ml and 0.81 +/- 0.03 mg/ml, respectively; both showed mixed-type inhibition. Phenolic compound, 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid was found to be a potent inhibitor of alpha-amylase with an IC50 value of 0.046 +/- 0.004 mg/ml. Alginates found in brown seaweeds appeared to be potent inhibitors of alpha-amylase activity with an IC50 of (0.075 +/- 0.010-0.103 +/- 0.017) mg/ml, also a mixed-type inhibition. Overall, the findings provide information that crude extracts of brown edible seaweeds, phenolic compounds and alginates are potent alpha-amylase inhibitors, thereby potentially retarding glucose liberation from starches and alleviation of postprandial hyperglycaemia.

AB The agrifood industry produces tons of waste and substandard products that are discarded at great expense. Valorization of industrial residues curbs issues related to food security and environmental problems. Broccoli (Brassica oleracea var. italica) is associated with varied beneficial health effects, but its production yields greater than 25% rejects. We aimed to characterize and quantify industrial broccoli by-products for their glucosinolate and polyphenol contents as a first step towards industrial bio-refining. Broccoli segments and rejected lots of 10 seed cultivars were analyzed using UPLC MS/MS. Variability in the contents of bioactive molecules was observed within and between the cultivars. Broccoli by-products were rich in glucosinolates (0.2-2% dry weight sample), predominantly glucoraphanin (32-64% of the total glucosinolates), whereas the polyphenolic content was less than 0.02% dry weight sample. Valorization of industrial residues facilitates the production of high value functional food ingredients along with socio-economic sustainability.

AB Combinations of pressure, temperature and time (100-600 MPa, 30-60 degrees C, 3-10 min) influence enzyme activity of the myrosinase-glucosinolate system. Seedlings of Brussels sprouts were used as a model, which constitutes a well-defined and homogenous sample matrix with simple cell structures. A response surface methodology approach was used to determine the combined effect of pressure level, temperature and time on glucosinolate concentration and myrosinase activity in Brussels sprouts seedlings. The effects on residual myrosinase activity and intact glucosinolate concentration differed according to combinations of pressure, time and temperature. The results showed that maximum inactivation of myrosinase and preservation of glucosinolate (85% of the untreated level) was obtained after HP treatment at 600 MPa, 60 degrees C, 10 min. The highest preservation of myrosinase activity compared to untreated seedlings was after HP at 100 MPa, 30 degrees C, 3 min and 10 min with low degree of cell permeabilization.

AB Firstly, we report the localization analysis of the lipid components of a water-in-oil (W/O) semi-solid emulsion by mass spectrometry imaging (MSI). Uniform emulsion droplets were prepared using microchannel emulsification devices with lecithin, stearic acid-binding monoglyceride (St-MAG), and polyglycerol polyricinoleate (PGPR) as emulsifiers. The mass image gives us the localization of phosphatidylcholine (PC) in lecithin, St-MAG, tripalmitin (PPP), medium-chain triglyceride (MCT), and high-melting-point triglyceride tristearin (C18-TAG). PC, St-MAG, and PPP were localized at the interface with the dispersed water droplets. PC and PPP took the same localized position, suggesting an interaction between PC and PPP at the interface. Conversely, PC existed in other regions with St-MAG. MSI revealed multiple target molecules in fat products in a single measurement, and it is expected to reveal fat crystallization at the emulsion interfaces, which will clarify the mechanisms related to the physical properties of high-fat products such as fat spread and butter.

AB The orange-fleshed sweet potato is a vegetable-rich in carotenoids. The thermic treatment for sweet potato processing can decrease the content of these constituents in the foods, lowering their bioactive properties. Raman spectroscopy has been growing as a fast tool to food analysis, especially for detection of low concentrations of carotenoids and to the monitoring of its degradation profile over time. Therefore, in this work were evaluated two methods of drying, hot air and microwaving with rotary drum, combined with quantitative Raman spectroscopy. The results showed carotenoids degradation around 50% for both types of drying processes studied. PCA plot proved the potential of reproducibility of analyses for microwave drying samples. For samples heated with hot air, the best linear correlation achieved was R-2 = 0.90 and by microwave was R-2 = 0.88. Also, partial least squares (PLS) regression models were constructed obtaining a satisfactory coefficient of determination.

AB A complete characterization of yacon syrup was performed by analytical techniques, including NMR and UPLC-QTOF-MSE. The effect of the different stages of yacon syrup production on fructooligosaccharides (FOS) and chlorogenic acid (CGA) contents were also evaluated. As a result, in addition to higher levels of FOS and CGA, some mineral elements, such as K, Ca and P, and essential amino acids, such as tryptophan, valine, and threonine, were determined in yacon syrup. Twenty-five compounds were putatively identified, and the main compounds were phenolics derived from quinic and trans-cinnamic acids. Considering the different stages of yacon syrup production, the results indicate that the contents of FOS and CGA were maintained in the pulping, enzymatic maceration and microfiltration, leading to a concentration of these components in the last stage of processing (vacuum concentration). These results will be used to fortify this innovative and promising product in the area of functional foods.

AB DNA-based immunization has proven to be an effective prophylactic measure to control aquatic animal diseases. In order to improve the efficiency of vaccine against fish pathogen, novel delivery mechanism needs to be adopted. In the present study we nanoconjugated the previously constructed DNA vaccine (pGPD + IFN) with chitosan nanoparticles (CNPs) by complex coacervation process. After construction of the vaccine, an in vivo vaccination trial was conducted in which 2 groups of rohu (L. rohita) fingerlings were vaccinated with CNPs-pGPD + IFN, one group by oral route (incorporated in feed for 14 days) and the other by immersion route (primary and booster immunised), whereas, a third group was intramuscularly (I/M) injected (initial and booster immunised) with naked pGPD + IFN and subsequently challenged with E. tarda (8.7 x 10(4) CFU/fish) at 35-day post initial vaccination. The protective immune responses were determined in terms of relative percentage survival (RPS), specific antibody production, non-specific immune response, expression kinetics of immune-related genes and pathological manifestation. Evaluation of RPS analysis revealed that CNPs-pGPD + IFN groups recorded highest RPS (81.82% and 72.73% in oral and immersion vaccinated fish group respectively) while the naked pGPD + IFN injected group showed 63.62% RPS when compared with 55% cumulative mortality of control group. In addition, NBT, myeloperoxidase activity, serum lysozyme activity and specific antibody titre in case of CNPs-pGPD + IFN groups showed higher activities during all the time points. Furthermore, CNPs-pGPD + IFN groups showed significant (p < 0.05) upregulation of different immune gene transcripts (IgHC, iNOS, TLR22, NOD1 and IL-1 beta) in three immunologically important tissues post immunization (both primary and booster dose) as well as after challenge. Thus, from this study, we can conclude that oral or immersion vaccination with CNPs-pGPD + IFN can orchestrate an effective immunisation strategy in organizing a coordinative immune response against E. tarda in L rohita exhibiting minimum stress to the host with maximum efficacy.

AB In many settings, serotype changes as a result of infant 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) programs are likely to continue after the introduction of adult PCV13 programs. We applied a multi-cohort model to explore how potential serotype changes may impact on the cost-effectiveness of PCV13 use in Australian adults aged over 65 years. We found assumptions around continued herd protection from infant PCV13 programs to be critical when assessing the cost-effectiveness of adult PCV13 vaccination in Australia. Future cost-effectiveness analyses of adult PCV13 programs need to carefully consider how to predict these future changes in serotypes, with Australian data suggesting that the changes post-PCV13 use in infants may be different than post-PCV7.

AB Although Chlamydia has been frequently detected in the gastrointestinal tracts of both humans and animals, it is not associated with any gastrointestinal pathology. We have recently shown that gastrointestinal Chlamydia muridarum is not only non-pathogenic but also induces protective immunity in the genital tract. We now report that the transmucosal immunity induced by a single oral immunization with C. muridarum protected the mouse airway from a subsequent challenge infection. The oral immunization significantly reduced chlamydial burden in the airway as early as day 3 after intranasal challenge. As a result, the airway chlamydial spreading to extra-airway tissues was completely prevented on day 3 and significantly reduced on day 9. The immunized mice were protected from any significant systemic toxicity caused by the intranasal challenge since there was no significant bodyweight drop in the immunized mice. This robust protection correlated well with Chlamydia-specific antibodies that recognize chlamydial organism surface antigens and T cell responses that are dominated with a Th1 phenotype. The immunized mice developed high ratios of IgG2b/c over IgG1 levels and IFN gamma-producing over IL-5 or IL-13-producing lymphocytes. Thus, we have demonstrated that oral vaccination with C muridarum can induce Th1-dominant transmucosal immunity in the airway. Together with previous studies, we propose that non-pathogenic colonization of Chlamydia in the gastrointestinal tract be explored as an oral delivery system for inducing protection against infections and pathologies in extra-gastrointestinal tissues.

AB Pellicles, a type of biofilm, have gathered a renewed interest in the field of tuberculosis as a structure that mimics some characteristics occurring during M. tuberculosis infection, such as antibiotic recalcitrance and chronicity of infection, and as a source of antigens for humoral response in infected guinea pigs. In other bacteria, it has been well documented that the second messenger c-di-GMP modulates the transition from planktonic cells to biofilm formation. In this work, we used the live vaccine Mycobacterium bovis BCG to determine whether deletion of genes involved in c-di-GMP metabolism would affect interaction with macrophages, capacity to induce immune response in a murine cell line and mice, and how the protein profile was modified when grown as surface pellicles. We found that deletion of the BCG1419c (Delta c-di-GMP phosphodiesterase, APDE) gene, or deletion of the BCG1416c (Delta c-di-GMP diguanylate cyclase, ADGC) gene, altered production of TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-1 beta, in murine macrophages, and resulted in attenuation in intra-macrophage replication. Moreover, in addition to the improved immunogenicity of the BCG Delta BCG1419c mutant already reported, deletion of the BCG1416c gene leads to increased T CD4(+) and T CD8(+) activation. This correlated with protection versus lethality in mice infected with the highly virulent M. tuberculosis 5186 afforded by vaccination with all the tested BCG strains, and controlled the growth of the mildly virulent M. tuberculosis H37Rv in lungs by vaccination with BCG Delta BCG1419c during chronic late infection from 4 to 6 months after challenge. Furthermore, when grown as surface pellicles, a condition used to manufacture BCG vaccine, in comparison to BCG wild type, both rBCGs changed expression of antigenic proteins such as DnaK, HbhA, PstS2, 35KDa antigen, GroEL2, as well as AcpM, a protein involved in synthesis of mycolic acids, molecules relevant to modulate inflammatory responses.

TI Epidemiological profile and progress toward rubella elimination in.
   China. 10 years after nationwide introduction of rubella vaccine
SO VACCINE
LA English
DT Article
DE Rubella; Surveillance; Elimination
ID OUTBREAK; CITY
AB Background: Rubella -containing vaccine (RCV) became available in China in 1993 and was introduced nationwide into the Expanded Immunization Program (EPI) in 2008. We evaluated implementation and impact of RCV from 2 years prior to nationwide introduction through the 10 years after nationwide introduction.
   Methods: We analyzed RCV lot-release (doses distributed) data, 1- and 2-dose RCV coverage, and rubella data from China's nationwide disease surveillance system to describe the current status and changes in rubella epidemiology between 2005 and 2017.
   Results: While the vaccine was included into the routine immunization program in 2008, its full implementation required 4 years due to sporadic vaccine supply constraints. RCV1 and RCV2 coverage increased from 51.5% and 39.0% in 2008 to >95% during 2012 through 2016. From 2005 to 2017, the annual incidences (per million) of rubella ranged from 91.09 in 2008 down to 1.16 in 2017; reductions occurred in all age groups. The proportion of cases among individuals >= 20 years old increased from 0.97% in 2005 to 31.2% in 2017. In the better-developed eastern China, most cases were among adults; in central and western China, most cases were among children or adolescents.
   Conclusions: The marked decrease rubella was a result of inclusion of RCVs into EPI targeting children less than 2 years of age and achieving high level of 2-dose coverage. Rubella was reduced in absolute terms, and its epidemiology was changed to older cases with substantial inter-province variation. Ensuring full vaccination of school children and identifying strategies to reach adults with measles and rubella combined vaccines will be important to hasten elimination of rubella and prevent CRS outbreaks.

AB The outer capsid protein VP4 is an important target for the development of a recombinant rotavirus vaccine because it mediates the attachment and penetration of rotavirus. Due to the poor solubility of full-length VP4, VP8 was explored as candidate rotavirus vaccines in the past years. In previous studies, it has been found that the N-terminal truncated VP8 protein, VP8-1 (aa26-231), could be expressed in soluble form with improved immunogenicity compared to the core of VP8 (aa65-223). However, this protein stimulated only a weak immune response when aluminum hydroxide was used as an adjuvant. In addition, it should be noted that the protective efficacy of VP4 was higher than that of VP8 and VP5. In this study, it was found that when the N-terminal 25 amino acids were deleted, the truncated VP4* (aa26-476) containing VP8 and the stalk domain of VP5 could be expressed in soluble form in E. coli and purified to homogeneous trimers. Furthermore, the truncated VP4 could induce high titers of neutralizing antibodies when aluminum adjuvant was used and conferred high protective efficacy in reducing the severity of diarrhea and rotavirus shedding in stools in animal models. The immunogenicity of the truncated VP4 was significantly higher than that of VP8* and VP5* alone. Taken together, the truncated VP4* (aa26-476), with enhanced immunogenicity and immunoprotectivity, could be considered as a viable candidate for further development and has the potential to become a parenterally administered rotavirus vaccine.

AB The global adoption of vaccines to combat disease is hampered by the high cost of vaccine manufacturing. The work described herein follows two previous publications (van der Sanden et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2017) that report a strategy to enhance poliovirus and rotavirus vaccine production through genetic modification of the Vero cell lines used in large-scale vaccine manufacturing. CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing tools were used to knockout Vero target genes previously shown to play a role in polio- and rotavirus production. Subsequently, small-scale models of current industry manufacturing systems were developed and adopted to assess the increases in polio- and rotavirus output by multiple stable knockout cell lines. Unlike previous studies, the Vero knockout cell lines failed to achieve desired target yield increases. These findings suggest that additional research will be required before implementing the genetically engineered Vero cell lines in the manufacturing process for polio- and rotavirus vaccines to be able to supply vaccines at reduced prices.

AB Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is associated with acute hepatitis disease. Numerous truncated HEV capsid proteins have been successfully expressed using different expression systems. Among these, p495, a protein truncated at its N- and C-termini by 111 and 54 amino acids (aa), respectively (HEV ORF2 aa 112-606) can self-assemble into T - 1 virus-like particles (VLPs) when expressed by insect cells. A shorter p239 (aa 368-606) protein is a particulate antigen that we have previously used in our commercialized HEV vaccine, Hecolin. Here, we sought to express p495 in its soluble form (named Ep495) in E. coli and in baculovirus-infected Tn5 insect cells (named BTp495) as a back-to-back control. Characterization of p495 particles derived from these two expression systems showed similarities in particle size, morphology, and sedimentation coefficient. Antigenicity assays using a panel of anti-HEV monoclonal antibodies also showed similar strong reactivities for Ep495 and BTp495, as well as similar binding profiles that were congruent with p239. Mouse immunization results showed that Ep495 particles had comparable immunogenicity with that of BTp495 VLPs, as well as p239. Overall, our findings suggest that p495 particles produced in E. coil are ideal for the development of next-generation prophylactic vaccines against hepatitis E. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Hajj is the world's largest annual mass gathering that attracts two to three million Muslims from around the globe to a religious assemblage in Makkah, Saudi Arabia. The risk of acquisition and transmission of influenza among Hajj pilgrims is high. Therefore, influenza vaccination is recommended, and was monitored frequently among pilgrims from different countries. However, the vaccination uptake among Saudi pilgrims has not been assessed in recent years.
   Objective: This analysis aims to evaluate influenza vaccine uptake among Saudi Hall pilgrims, and identify the key barriers to vaccination.
   Method: Data on influenza vaccination were obtained from Saudi pilgrims who took part in a large trial during the Hajj of 2013, 2014 and 2015. Pilgrims were met and recruited in Mina, Makkah during the peak period of Hajj and were asked to complete a baseline questionnaire that recorded their influenza vaccination history, including reason(s) for non-receipt of vaccine.
   Results: A total of 6974 Saudi pilgrims aged between 18 and 95 (median 34) years were recruited; male to female ratio was 1:1.2. Of the total, 90.8% declared their influenza vaccination history, 51.3% of them reported receiving influenza vaccine before travel to Hajj. The vaccination rates for the years 2013, 2014 and 2015 were 21.4%, 48.2% and 58.1%, respectively (P < 0.001). Of 1,269 pilgrims who were at higher risk of severe disease, 54.5% received the vaccine. Lack of awareness (47.5%), reliance on natural immunity (15.8%) and being busy (15.5%) were the main reasons for non-receipt.
   Conclusion: These data from a convenience sample indicate that influenza vaccine uptake among Saudi Hajj pilgrims is increasing over years but still needs further improvement. Lack of awareness and misperceptions are the main barriers. Education of Saudi pilgrims and health professionals is required to raise awareness about influenza vaccination. Further studies are needed to understand pilgrims' misperceptions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Vaccination of broilers is one of the potential ways to decrease Campylobacter intestinal loads and therefore may reduce human disease incidence. Despite many studies, no efficient vaccine is available yet. Using the reverse vaccinology strategy, we recently identified new vaccine candidates whose immune and protective capacities need to be evaluated in vivo. Therefore, the goal of the present study was to develop and evaluate an avian subunit vaccine protocol for poultry against Campylobacter jejuni. For this, fiagellin was used as vaccine antigen candidate. A DNA prime/protein boost regimen was effective in inducing a massive protective immune response against C. jejuni in specific pathogen free Leghorn chickens. Contrastingly, the same vaccine regimen stimulated the production of antibodies against Campylobacter in conventional Ross broiler chickens harbouring maternally derived antibodies against Campylobacter, but not the control of C. jejuni colonization. These results highlight the strength of the vaccine protocol in inducing protective immunity and the significance of the avian strain and/or immune status in the induction of this response. Nevertheless, as such the vaccine protocol is not efficient in broilers to induce protection and has to be adapted; this has been done in one of our recent published work. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Introduction: High rate of influenza infection in children made influenza vaccination strongly recommended for all person aged >6 months in Indonesia. Bio Farina Trivalent Influenza HA (Flubio (R)) vaccine has been used in adolescents and adults, resulted in increased seroconversion, seroprotection rates and geometric mean titer (GMT). However, no data is available regarding its efficacy and safety in children. This study aimed to assess the immunogenicity and safety of Flubio (R) vaccine in infants and children.
   Materials and methods: This was a phase II, open-labeled, clinical trial conducted on healthy children aged 6 month-11 years, vaccinated with 1 or 2 doses of Influenza HA vaccine, with a 28-day interval. Flubio (R) vaccine composed of A/Califomia/7/2009 (H1N1) pandemic 09, A/Texas/50/2012 (H3N2), and B/Massachusetts/2/2012 strain. This study was held at East Jakarta, Indonesia from May until July 2014. A Total of 405 subjects were included and divided into three groups: A(6-35 months), B(3-8 years), and C(9-11 years). Antibody titer was measured at visit V1 (Day 0), V2 (28 days/+7days after the first dose) and V3 (28 days/+7days after second dose). The seroprotection and seroconversion rates were assessed. Safety was assessed up to 28 days following each dose.
   Results: A total of 404 subjects completed the study. After vaccination, all subjects achieved seroprotection and increased seroconversion rates, with post-vaccination antibody titer of >= 1:40 HI for all strains. The GMT also increased significantly. Within 30 min after vaccination, 14.6% and 2% had local and systemic reactions; meanwhile, between 30 min to 72 h after vaccination, 35.1% and 13.6% subjects had local and systemic reactions, respectively. Most reactions were mild. No serious adverse event (SAE) was reported related to vaccine.
   Conclusion: Flubio (R) (Influenza HA Trivalent) vaccine is immunogenic and safe for children aged 6 mont hs-11 years. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Menactre (R) vaccine (MenACWY-D) was licensed in the United States in 2005 for persons 1155 years of age, in 2007 for children 2-10 years of age, and in 2011 for infants/toddlers 9-23 months of age. We conducted two studies at Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), an integrated health care organization, to assess the safety of MenACWY-D in 2-10-year-olds and 9-23-month-olds receiving the vaccine during routine clinical care.
   Methods: We conducted observational, retrospective studies of MenACWY-D in 2-10-year-olds (October 2007-October 2010) and in 9-23-month-olds (June 2011-june 2014). We monitored all subjects for non elective hospitalizations, emergency department visits, and selected outpatient outcomes (specified neurological conditions, hypersensitivity reactions and new-onset autoimmune diseases) up to 6 months after vaccination, depending on the study. Using a self-control risk-interval design, we calculated incidence rate ratios (IRRs) comparing outcomes during the post-vaccination risk interval (0-30 days) with those during more remote post-vaccination comparison intervals (31-60 and 31-180 days [children] or 31-75 days [infants/toddlers]).
   Results: There were 1421 children aged 2-10 years and 116 infants/toddlers aged 9-23 months who received MenACWY-D. Approximately 30% of the 2-10-year-olds and 67% of the 9-23-month-olds were considered at increased risk of meningococcal disease. Among 2-10-year-olds, there was 1 hospitalization on post-vaccination day 5 for fever, which was considered possibly related to vaccination. The only significantly elevated outcome among 2-10-year-olds was cellulitis/abscess (2 cases occurred during the risk interval versus 0 during comparison interval; IRR not evaluable [NE], 95% CI: 1.42, NE). After medical record review, the 2 cases were considered unrelated to vaccination. Among 9-23-month-olds, no outcomes were significantly elevated after vaccination and there were no hospitalizations. There were no deaths observed during the three-year accrual and subsequent six-month surveillance period for either study.
   Conclusions: Immunization of infants and young children with MenACWY-D vaccine was not associated with any new safety concerns; however, these small studies had limited power to detect rare or uncommon safety events. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In ovo immunization of chicken embryos with live vaccines is an effective strategy to protect chickens against several viral pathogens. We investigated the immune response of chicken embryos to purified recombinant protein. In ovo delivery of Salmonella flagellin to 18-day old embryonated eggs resulted in elevated pro -inflammatory chlL-6 and chlL-8 (CXCL8-CXCLi2) cytokine transcript levels in the intestine but not in the spleen at 24 h post-injection. Analysis of the chicken Toll-like receptor (TLR) repertoire in 19-day old embryos revealed gene transcripts in intestinal and spleen tissue for most chicken TLRs, including TLR5 which recognizes Salmonella flagellin (FIiC). The in ovo administration of FIiC did not alter TLR transcript levels, except for an increase in intestinal chTLR15 expression. Measurement of the antibody response in sera collected at day 11 and day 21 post-hatch demonstrated high titers of FliC-specific antibodies for the animals immunized at the late-embryonic stage in contrast to the mock-treated controls. The successful in ovo immunization with purified bacterial antigen indicates that the immune system of the chicken embryo is sufficiently mature to yield a strong humoral immune response after single exposure to purified protein. This finding strengthens the basis for the development of in ovo protein based subunit vaccines. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Plant-made virus-like particle (VIP) vaccines that display wild-type influenza hemagglutinin (HA) are rapidly advancing through clinical trials. Produced by transient transfection of Nicotiana benthamiana, these novel vaccines are unusually immunogenic, eliciting both humoral and cellular responses. Here, we directly visualized VLPs bearing either HA trimers derived from strains A/California/7/2009 or A/Indonesia/5/05 using cryo-electron microscopy and determined the 3D organization of the VLPs using cryo-electron tomography. More than 99.9% of the HA trimers in the vaccine preparations were found on discoid and ovoid-shaped particles. The discoid-shaped VLPs presented HA trimers on their outer diameter. The ovoid-shaped VLPs contained HA trimers evenly distributed at their surface. The VLPs were stable for 12 months at 4 degrees C. Early interactions of the VLPs with mouse dendritic and human monocytoid (U-937) cells were visualized by electron microscopy after resin-embedding and sectioning. The VLP particles were observed bound to plasma membranes as well as inside vesicles. Mouse dendritic cells exposed to VLPs displayed classic morphological changes associated with activation including the extensive formation of dendrites. Our findings demonstrate that plant-made VLPs bearing influenza HA trimers are morphologically stable over time and raise the possibility that these VLPs may interact with and activate antigen-presenting cells in a manner similar to the intact virus.

AB Background: Ongoing assessment of influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) is critical to inform public health policy. This study aimed to determine the VE of trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) for preventing influenza related hospitalizations and other serious outcomes over three consecutive influenza seasons.
   Methods: The Serious Outcomes Surveillance (SOS) Network of the Canadian Immunization Research Network (CIRN) conducted active surveillance for influenza in adults >= 16 years (y) of age during the 2011/2012, 2012/2013 and 2013/2014 seasons in hospitals across Canada. A test-negative design was employed: cases were polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive for influenza; controls were PCR-negative for influenza and were matched to cases by date, admission site, and age (>= 65 y or <65 y). All cases and controls had demographic and clinical characteristics (including influenza immunization status) obtained from the medical record. VE was estimated as 1-OR (odds ratio) in vaccinated vs. unvaccinated patients x 100%. The primary outcome was VE of TIV for preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza-related hospitalization; secondary outcomes included VE of TIV for preventing influenza related intensive care unit (ICU) admission/mechanical ventilation, and influenza-related death.
   Results: Overall, 3394 cases and 4560 controls were enrolled; 2078 (61.2%) cases and 2939 (64.5%) controls were >= 65 y. Overall matched, adjusted VE was 41.7% (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 34.4-48.3%); corresponding VE in adults >= 65 y was 39.3% (95% CI: 29.4-47.8%) and 48.0% (95% CI: 37.5-56.7%) in adults <65 y, respectively. VE for preventing influenza-related ICU admission/mechanical ventilation in all ages was 54.1% (95% Cl: 39.8-65.0%); in adults >= 65 y, VE for preventing influenza-related death was 74.5% (95% CI: 44.0-88.4%).
   Conclusions: While effectiveness of TIV to prevent serious outcomes varies year to year, we demonstrate a statistically significant and clinically important TIV VE for preventing hospitalization and other serious outcomes over three seasons. Public health messaging should highlight the overall benefit of influenza vaccines over time while acknowledging year to year variability. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients are more susceptible to infections from vaccine preventable diseases (VPDs) than the general population. Indian stem cell transplant registry (ISCTR) post-BMT vaccination guidelines were formulated in 2015. The objective of the survey was to assess the compliance to these guidelines among transplant physicians in India.
   Materials and methods: This is a cross-sectional survey executed as the quantitative research strategy to explore the various aspects of vaccination practices among transplant physicians in India. The 'data collection tool' included 36 predetermined questions related to vaccination of the patients and their close contacts. Theoretical construct of the questionnaire was face-validated and questionnaire survey forms were emailed individually as attachments or by google forms. This study is being reported based on the checklist for reporting results of interne e-surveys statement guidelines.
   Results: Survey forms were sent to 105 transplant physicians in India, 62% of whom responded representing 78.8% of transplant centers in India. More than 90% of allogeneic transplant physicians and 64% of autologous transplant physicians offered vaccination. Over two third of the physicians responded that they would discontinue vaccination at the onset of cGVHD. Fewer than one third physicians offered vaccination against Hepatitis A, Typhoid or Meningococcal infections. Forty two percent of respondents were unaware of the ISCTR post-BMT vaccination protocol. Only 47% of respondents reported complete adherence to any of the protocols they were following. Immune reconstitution to guide vaccination was available only to 13.3 percent of respondents.
   Conclusion: There is a need to improve the implementation strategies of vaccination in HSCT recipients to increase the adherence and continuation of it even in the presence of GVHD. There is also a need to extend the vaccination among VPDs especially prevalent in India. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Human papilloma virus (HPV)-associated cancer is a significant global health burden and despite the presence of viral transforming antigens within neoplastic cells, therapeutic vaccinations are ineffective for advanced disease. HPV positive TC1 cells are susceptible to viral oncolysis by MG1-E6E7, a custom designed oncolytic Maraba virus. Epitope mapping of mice vaccinated with MG1-E6E7 enabled the rational design of synthetic long peptide (SLP) vaccines against HPV16 and HPV18 antigens. SLPs were able to induce specific CD8+ immune responses and the magnitude of these responses significantly increased when boosted by MGJ-E6E7. Logically designed vaccination induced multi-functional CD8+ T cells and provided complete sterilising immunity of mice challenged with TC1 cells. In mice bearing large HPV-positive tumours, SLP vaccination combined with MG1-E6E7 was able to clear tumours in 60% of mice and these mice were completely protected against a long term aggressive re-challenge with the TC1 tumour model. Combining conventional SLPs with the multi-functional oncolytic MG1-E6E7 represents a promising approach against advanced HPV positive neoplasia. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Vaccination is a key element in the control of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD). The majority of the antigenic sites that induce protective immune responses are localized on the FMD virus (FMDV) capsid that is formed by four virus-encoded structural proteins, VP1 to VP4. In the present study, recombinant canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV2)-based FMD vaccines, Cav-Pl/3C R degrees and Cav-VP1 R degrees, respectively expressing the structural P1 precursor protein along with the non-structural 3C protein or expressing the structural VP1 protein of the FMDV strain O/FRA/1/2001, were evaluated as novel vaccines against FMD. A strong humoral immune response was elicited in guinea pigs (GP) following immunization with Cav-P1/3C R, while administration of Cav-VP1 R degrees did not induce a satisfying antibody response in GP or mice. GP were then used as an experimental model for the determination of the protection afforded by the Cav/P1 R degrees vaccine against challenge with the FMDV strain O-1 Manisa/Turkey/1969. The Cav-P1/3C R vaccine protected GP from generalized FMD to a similar extent as a high potency double-oil emulsion O-1 Manisa vaccine. The results of the present study show that CAV2-based vector vaccines can express immunogenic FMDV antigens and offer protection against generalized FMD in GP. This suggest that Cav-P1 R FMDV vaccine may protect natural host species from FMD. In combination with an appropriate diagnostic test, the Cav-P1 R degrees FMDV vaccine may also serve as a marker vaccine to differentiate vaccinated from infected animals. (C) 2018 The Author(s).

AB Human adenoviruses types 3 (HAdV-3), 7 (HAdV-7) and 55 (HAdV-55) are major pathogens of acute respiratory infections (ARI) in children and adults. More than one type of HAdV can infect patients simultaneously, and the infections are sometimes fatal. However, there is currently no vaccine approved for general use in children and adults. Thus, development of a multivalent HMV vaccine to combat HAdV infection becomes imperative. In this study, we constructed a new recombinant trivalent human adenovirus vaccine (rAdMHE3-h55), which expresses the hexon protein of HAdV-55 in the E3 region of rAdMHE3, a previously prepared bivalent vaccine candidate against HAdV-3 and HAdV-7. The results of in vitro neutralization assays indicate that rAdMHE3-h55 can induce the production of neutralizing antibodies against HMV-3, HAdV-7, and HAdV-55 in mice. Furthermore, immunization with the recombinant trivalent vaccine candidate completely protected the mice challenged with HAdV-3, HAdV-7, orHAdV-55, respectively, showing lower lung viral loads and less lung Pathological changes was compared with those in unvaccinated mice. The current findings contribute to the development of a new adenovirus vaccine candidate and also advance this construction method for the generation of recombinant adenovirus vaccines. In conclusion, our recombinant trivalent vaccine rAdMHE3-h55 can provides protection against challenge with HMV-3, HAdV-7, or HAdV-55 in mice. Future work of optimizing this vaccine candidate may lead to a more effective way of preventing respiratory diseases caused by common human adenoviruses. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

HBsAg, anti-HBs and anti-HBc were detected for these vaccinees in 2013. A total of 252 out of 4701 vaccinees turned to be positive for anti-HBc in 2013, but nobody was positive for HBsAg. The HBBI rate was 5.36% (95% CI 4.73, 6.04). The highest rate was found in age-group of 18-29 years (733%, 95% CI: 5.31, 9.82). The rate was significantly different by the residential townships (P < 0.001) and by the antibody response to HepB (P = 0.003). Multivariate analysis showed that anti-HBs response to HepB was the independent risk factor of HBBI. The study documents the association between hyporesponse to HepB and HBBI among adults. It also suggests more attention should be given to new HBV infection among young adults. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Impact of pre-existing immunity on the induction of functional

AB The 2009 pandemic H1N1 (A(H1N1)pdm09) virus had a highly divergent hemagglutinin (HA) compared to pre-2009 seasonal H1N1 strains. Most peoples were immunologically naive to the A(H1N1)pdm09, although hospital workers were exposed early in the pandemic before pandemic vaccines became available. Here, we evaluated how pre-existing antibodies influence the induction of cross-functional HA stalk antibodies following A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccination.
   Fifty-six healthcare workers vaccinated with AS03 adjuvanted A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine were chosen by their pre-vaccination priming status (primed HI titers >= 40 or unprimed < 40). We analyzed the HA head and stalk-specific serum IgG subclasses at pre- and 21 days post-vaccination. We also assessed the functionality of the HA stalk-specific antibodies to neutralize virus and mediate antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC).
   Primed individuals had higher pm-existing HA head- and stalk-specific IgG1, as well as higher ADCC functionality of stalk antibodies. However, following vaccination with the adjuvanted pandemic vaccine, only the quantity of HA head specific IgG1 antibodies were significantly higher than in unprimed individuals. The priming status did not impact upon the cross-reactive HA stalk specific IgG antibodies or their ability to neutralize virus or induce ADCC post-vaccination. In conclusion, a single dose of AS03 adjuvanted pandemic vaccine elicited similar levels of functional antibodies in naive and primed individuals. These findings are important for understanding the immunological factors that impact or modulate pandemic vaccine responses in humans. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Influenza immunization is recommended for older adults annually, and has been reported to have cardiovascular protective effects. TNF-related weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK), an inflammatory mediator implicated in the development of cardiovascular diseases, could be a mechanism for such effect. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of influenza vaccine on TWEAK levels. Older persons over 70 years of age were recruited during 2007-2008 influenza season and immunized with the standard dose trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine. Frailty was evaluated using a validated set of criteria. Sera were collected immediately before and during the 4th week after vaccination. Pre- and post vaccination levels of TWEAK, soluble CD163 (sCD163) and strain-specific influenza antibody titers were measured in 69 participants. Multiple regression analyses were employed to examine the effect of influenza vaccine on TWEAK and sCD163, adjusting for age, sex, and hypertension. Post-vaccination TWEAK [mean standard deviation (SD) = 591.7 +/- 290.1 pg/ml] was significantly lower than pre-vaccination level (690.6 +/- 330.0 pg/ml) (p= .003). No significant difference was observed between pre and post vaccination sCD163 levels (p =.71). Post-vaccination TWEAK levels were significantly higher in men (p =.01) and in participants with college or higher level of education (p =.044). There was no significant difference in post-vaccination TWEAK according to other demographics or pre-existing medical conditions. A 2-fold or greater antibody titer against H1N1 vaccine strain was associated with a more pronounced reduction in TWEAK at the p <.10 level (p =.091). A time by frailty interaction term (p =.091) indicated that the vaccination-induced reduction of TWEAK was greatest among frail individuals. These results of this observational study indicate that the impact of Influenza vaccine on TWEAK, including the role of specific antibody responses of specific vaccine strains and frailty status, warrants further investigation. Such investigation may elucidate whether this effect plays a role in mediating cardiovascular protection of influenza vaccination. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Bioactive peptides contribute to various cellular processes including improved skin physiology. Hence, bioactive keratins have attracted considerable attention as active cosmetic ingredients for skin health. Here, we obtained low molecular weight (LMW) keratins from native chicken feathers by anaerobic digestion with an extremely thermophilic bacterium Fervidobacterium islandicum AW-1, followed by stepwise fractionation through ultrafiltration. To assess the effects of the feather keratins on skin health, we performed in vitro and ex vivo assays to investigate their inhibitory effects on matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). As results, LMW feather keratins marginally inhibited collagenase, elastase, and radical scavenging activities. On the other hand, LMW feather keratins significantly suppressed the expression of ultraviolet B (UVB)-induced MMP-1 and MMP-13 in human dermal fibroblasts. Furthermore, phospho-kinase antibody array revealed that LMW feather keratins suppressed UVB-induced phosphorylation of Akts, c-Jun N-terminal kinases 1, p38 beta, and RSK2, but not ERKs in human dermal fibroblast. Overall, these results suggest that LMW feather keratins are potential candidates as cosmeceutical peptides for anti-skin aging.

AB Magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles were prepared and embedded into the Combi-CLEAs to produce the magnetic Combi-CLEAs in this work. The process for magnetic Combi-CLEAs preparation was optimized, and its properties were investigated. The optimum temperature, thermal stability and optimum pH of magnetic Combi-CLEAs were similar to those of Combi-CLEAs. The catalytic performance of magnetic Combi-CLEAs was tested with the biosynthesis of (S)-ethyl 4-chloro-3-hydroxybutyrate ((S)-CHBE). Magnetic Combi-CLEAs could tolerate higher substrate concentration in the biphasic system. The catalytic efficiency and long-term operational stability of magnetic Combi-CLEAs were obviously superior to those of Combi-CLEAs in both aqueous and biphasic systems. Embedding of magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles endowing rigidity contributed to these improvements. Furthermore, the preparation of magnetic Combi-CLEAs was easy, and its recovery during multiple batches of reactions could be fulfilled by magnetic field. Aforementioned advantages make the magnetic Combi-CLEAs hold obvious potential for industrial application.

AB To investigate gene function in Bacillus anthracis, a high-efficiency cloning system is required with an increased rate of allelic exchange. Golden Gate cloning is a molecular cloning strategy allowing researchers to simultaneously and directionally assemble multiple DNA fragments to construct target plasmids using type IIs restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase in the same reaction system. Here, a B. anthracis S-layer protein EA1 allelic exchange vector was successfully constructed using the Golden Gate method. No new restriction sites were introduced into this knockout vector, and seamless assembly of the DNA fragments was achieved. To elevate the efficiency of homologous recombination between the allelic exchange vector and chromosomal DNA, we introduced an I-SceI site into the allelic exchange vector. The eag gene was successfully knocked out in B. anthracis using this vector. Simultaneously, the allelic exchange vector construction method was developed into a system for generating B. anthracis allelic exchange vectors. To verify the effectiveness of this system, some other allelic exchange vectors were constructed and gene replacements were performed in B. anthracis. It is speculated that this gene knockout vector construction system and high-efficiency targeted gene replacement using I-SceI endonuclease can be applied to other Bacillus spp.

AB New class IV transaminases with activity towards L-Leu, which is typical of branched-chain amino acid aminotransferases (BCAT), and with activity towards (R)-(+)-1-phenylethylamine ((R)-PEA), which is typical of (R)selective (R)-amine: pyruvate transaminases, were identified by bioinformatics analysis, obtained in recombinant form, and analyzed. The values of catalytic activities in the reaction with L-Leu and (R)-PEA are comparable to those measured for characteristic transaminases with the corresponding specificity. Earlier, (R)-selective class IV transaminases were found to be active, apart from (R)-PEA, only with some other (R)-primary amines and D-amino acids. Sequences encoding new transaminases with mixed type of activity were found by searching for changes in the conserved motifs of sequences of BCAT by different bioinformatics tools.

AB Neutrophils can strongly influence disease activity in cancer and in chronic inflammation. Here, we report for the first time the construction and characterization of antibody-fusion proteins featuring granulocyte-colony stimulating factor and interleukin-3 as payloads capable of enhancing neutrophil activity and a novel antibody-interleukin-4 fusion protein with neutrophil inhibitory potential. We used the F8 antibody specific to the alternatively-spliced extra domain A (EDA) of fibronectin as a targeting agent, since the cognate antigen is strongly upregulated in diseases characterized by angiogenesis.
   The fusion proteins GCSF-F8, F8-IL3 and F8-IL4-F8, were cloned, expressed, and their targeting ability assessed, exhibiting preferential tumor uptake with tumor: blood ratios at 24 h after injection of 3.3, 18.2 and 27.3, respectively.
   In F9 tumor bearing-mice GCSF-F8 and F8-IL3 did not provide a therapeutic benefit, while F8-IL4-F8 showed a potent tumor growth retardation. In the collagen-induced model of arthritis, GCSF-F8 and F8-IL3 induced a worsening of the disease, while F8-IL4-F8 slowed arthritis progression but, surprisingly, exhibited substantial toxicity when used in combination with dexamethasone.
   Collectively, the results indicate that the novel fusion proteins could be expressed and efficiently delivered to the site of disease. However, they were not superior to other antibody-cytokine fusions previously described by our laboratory.

AB Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are widely used in producing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), however, these cell lines can show variants associated with productivity and growth. Fundamental understanding of cellular mechanisms can benefit high mAbs production while maintaining robust cell growth. In this study, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) based approach was used to study the transcriptomic space among three mAb-producing CHO cell lines. A phenotypic contrast of higher productivity but lower growth was found with one cell line versus the other two cell lines. The messenger RNAs (mRNAs) from those cells at two different time points in culture were sequenced to seek the gene functions possibly associated with the phenotypic differences. It was found that the mAb transcripts from each cell line were correlated with the mAb production level, indicating a strong determination of production by the expression level of gene of interest (GOI). Further exploration in the global transcriptome showed that the high producers had more expression with genes related with secretion and protein transportation. In the meantime, the slower growth of the high producers was linked to higher regulation to cell growth as well as lower gene expression on biosynthesis, central metabolism and nutrient transport.

AB With the advance of complex biological formats such as bispecific antibodies or fusion proteins, mammalian expression systems often show low performance. Described determining factors may be accumulation or haltering of heterologous proteins within the different cellular compartments disturbing transport or secretion. In case of the investigated bispecific antibody (bsAb)-producing Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line neither impaired transcription nor decreased translation processes were identified and thus satisfactorily explained its low production capacity. Hence, we established a streamlined confocal microscopy-based methodology for CHO production cells investigating the distribution of the recombinant protein within the respective organelles of the secretory pathway and visualised the structure of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to be affected pinpointing towards an intra-ER bottleneck putatively hampering or limiting efficient secretion. The ER displayed not only a heavily altered morphology in comparison to a high immunoglobulin G (IgG)-producing cell line with a possibly inflated or overloaded structure, but the recombinant protein was also completely absent in the Golgi apparatus. Notably, the results obtained using an automated microscopy approach suggest the possible application of this methodology in cell line development and engineering.

AB Peptones are accepted as one of the most favourable nitrogen sources supporting pigment synthesis in Monascus purpureus. The present study was performed to test the feasibility of chicken feather peptone (CFP) as nitrogen source for pigment production from M. purpureus ATCC16365. CFP was compared with fish peptone (FP) and protease peptone (PP) in order to elucidate its effectiveness on pigment production. CFP was prepared from waste feathers using hydrolysis (KOH) and neutralization (H2SO4) methods. The protein content of CFP was determined as 67.2 g/100 g. Optimal concentrations of CFP and glucose for pigment production were determined as 3 and 20 g/L, respectively. A medium pH of 5.5 and an incubation period of 7-days were found to be more favourable for pigment production. In CFP, PP and FP media, yellow pigment absorbances were 2.819, 2.870 and 2.831, red pigment absorbances were 2.709, 2.304 and 2.748, and orange pigment absorbances were 2.643, 2.132 and 2.743, respectively. Sugar consumption and mycelia growth showed the similar trends in CFP, FP and PP media. This study indicates that the peptone from chicken feathers may be a good nutritional substrate for pigment production from M. purpureus.

AB Thyroid cancer is the most common type of endocrine malignancy and a leading cause of death among endocrine organ-related cancers. Similar to other types of cancers, early diagnosis of thyroid cancer is important to increase the survival and treatment of this disease. Several immunohistochemical markers are used in the differential diagnosis of thyroid papillary carcinoma. Also, increasing evidence indicates that P-element induced wimpy testis like 2 (PIWIL2) is an RNA-binding protein involved in the induction and progression of numerous types of human malignancies such as lung, breast, colon, prostate and cervix cancers. However, the role of PIWIL2 was poorly investigated in thyroid cancers. Accordingly, aim of the present study was to elucidate the relationship between PIWIL2 and thyroid cancers. The expression level of PIWIL2 was determined by analyzing both protein and mRNA levels in papillary and micropapillary carcinoma tissues by using immunohistochemistry and real-time PCR methods, respectively. Immunohistochemical analysis of HBME-1, galectin-3 and CK-19 was also performed. Similar to other immune markers of HBME-1, galectin-3 and CK-19, protein expression levels of PIWIL2 was significantly up-regulated in both papillary and micropapillary thyroid cancers (p < 0.01). Moreover, consistent with protein expression levels, mRNA expression levels of PIWIL2 was elevated in both papillary and micropapillary thyroid cancer tissues. Yet, mRNA expression changes were statistically insignificant. In conclusion, results of the current study suggest that PIWIL2 can be involved in thyroid cancer tumorigenesis and can be used as a novel predictive biomarker and/or therapeutic target.

AB Long noncoding RNAs is a novel class of RNA molecules, which is closely related to the occurrence and development of human disease. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of MEG3 in angiogenesis and the maintenance of normal function of vascular endothelial cells. However, whether MEG3 contributes to human endothelial cell angiogenesis as well as potential mechanisms are largely unknown. In this work, we found that the high expression level of MEG3 in primary HUVEC was controlled by DNA methylation, and its expression in HUVEC was regulated by HIF-1 alpha under hypoxia condition. Meanwhile, we discovered that knockdown of MEG3 significantly suppressed VEGFR2 mRNA level, but had no influence on gene expression of VEGFR1, Notch1, DLL4 and Hes1. MEG3 reduction also suppressed VEGF-induced endothelial migration and angiogenesis. Furthermore, MEG3 knockdown reduced the tube formation and the spheroid sprouting of primary HUVEC under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Altogether, MEG3 regulated by HIF-1 alpha is required to maintain VEGFR2 expression in endothelial cells and plays a vital role for VEGFA-mediated endothelial angiogenesis.

Red-eared sliders (Trachemys scripta elegans) can tolerate and survive three months of absolute anoxia and recover without incurring detrimental cellular damage, mainly by reducing the overall metabolic rate by 90% when compared to normoxia. Stringent regulation of gene expression is a vital aspect of metabolic rate depression in red-eared sliders, and as such we examined the anoxia-responsive regulation of histone lysine methylation in the liver during 5 h and 20 h anoxia exposure. Interestingly, this is the first study to illustrate the existence of histone lysine methyltransferases (HKMTs) and corresponding histone H3 lysine methylation levels in the liver of anoxia-tolerant red-eared sliders. In brief, H3K4me1, a histone mark associated with active transcription, and two corresponding histone lysine methyltransferases that modify H3K4mel site, significantly increased in response to anoxia. On the contrary, H3K27mel, another transcriptionally active histone mark, significantly decreased during 20 h anoxia, and a transcriptionally repressive histone mark, H3K9me3, and the corresponding KMTs, similarly increased during 20 h anoxia. Overall, the results suggest a dynamic regulation of histone H3 lysine methylation in the liver of red-eared sliders that could theoretically aid in the selective up regulation of genes that are necessary for anoxia survival, while globally suppressing others to conserve energy.

AB Microbial association with a host using model system C. elegans have been widely studied based on factors such as host survival, the mode of infection, disease pathogenesis and the role of various players regulated during infection. The influence of pathogenic microorganism on reproduction and associated issues has not been explored fully. The present study focuses on the impact of bacterial infection on male reproductive parameters such as spermatogenesis and spermiogenesis, including physiological aspects like tail morphology defect and underlying molecular mechanisms that have been perturbed. In order to compare the consequence of infection caused by Gram positive and negative bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus and Vibrio alginolyticus were chosen as candidate pathogens, respectively. Microscopic observations revealed notable changes in tail morphology during 24 h of infection, as along with change in sperm size and activation. The Real Time-PCR results suggest the plausible down regulation of DBL-1/TGF-beta pathway suggesting the morphological change in the tail. Shotgun proteomics further lead to the identification of MAG-1, Magonashi Protein a candidate regulatory player that affects spermatogenesis and HIF-1 that regulate during stress in both Gram positive and Gram negative infection. The protein-protein interaction with detected proteins revealed RACK-1 protein and mTOR pathway in S. aureus and V. alginolyticus respectively interacting with MAG-1 protein, which plays an important role in spermatogenesis termination in hermaphrodites during L4 to adult switch. This study paves a way to understand the candidate players that regulate reproduction during bacterial infection.

AB Statistical moments were evaluated as suitable parameters for describing swelling and erosion processes (along with drug release) in hydrophilic controlled release matrix tablets. The effect of four independent formulation variables, corresponding to the quantity of four polymeric matrix excipients (namely polyethylene glycol, povidone, and two grades of hydroxyl-propylmethyl cellulose) on statistical moments describing swelling (mean swelling time, MST), erosion (mean erosion time, MET) and drug-release (mean dissolution time, MDT) was evaluated with the aid of multi-linear regression (MLR) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) based on a central composite experimental design. Results were compared to conventional model fitting, where the rate of water uptake during swelling (a), the maximum % water uptake (S-max), the time at which S-max is achieved (t(max)), the constant of apparent matrix-tablet erosion rate (k(e)) and the release exponent (n) from Korsmeyer-Peppas drug-release equation were used as model parameters. Fitting to an external validation test set revealed superior prediction efficacy for statistical moments compared to conventional model fitting, while the combination of statistical moments with ANNs presented the most efficient approach (R-2 and RMSEp values of 0.922, 0.833, 0.987 and 0.443, 0.691, 0.173 for MST, MET, and MDT, respectively).

AB The aim of the present study was to compare two DSC-based methods to predict drug-polymer solubility (melting point depression method and recrystallization method) and propose a guideline for selecting the most suitable method based on physicochemical properties of both the drug and the polymer. Using the two methods, the solubilities of celecoxib, indomethacin, carbamazepine, and ritonavir in polyvinylpyrrolidone, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, and Soluplus (R) were determined at elevated temperatures and extrapolated to room temperature using the Flory-Huggins model. For the melting point depression method, it was observed that a well-defined drug melting point was required in order to predict drug-polymer solubility, since the method is based on the depression of the melting point as a function of polymer content. In contrast to previous findings, it was possible to measure melting point depression up to 20 degrees C below the glass transition temperature (T-g) of the polymer for some systems. Nevertheless, in general it was possible to obtain solubility measurements at lower temperatures using polymers with a low T-g. Finally, for the recrystallization method it was found that the experimental composition dependence of the T-g must be differentiable for compositions ranging from 50 to 90% drug (w/w) so that one T-g corresponds to only one composition. Based on these findings, a guideline for selecting the most suitable thermal method to predict drug-polymer solubility based on the physicochemical properties of the drug and polymer is suggested in the form of a decision tree.

AB Various types of nanoparticles (NPs) have been used in delivering anticancer drugs to the site of action. This area has become more attractive in recent years due to optimal size and negligible undesirable side effects caused by the NPs. The focus of this review is to explore various types of NPs and their surface/chemical modifications as well as attachment of targeting ligands for tuning their properties in order to facilitate targeted delivery to the cancer sites in a rate-controlled manner. Heme compatibility, biodistribution, longer circulation time, hydrophilic lipophilic balance for high bioavailability, prevention of drug degradation and leakage are important in transporting drugs to the targeted cancer sites. The review discusses advantages of polymeric, magnetic, gold, and mesoporous silica NPs in delivering chemotherapeutic agents over the conventional dosage formulations along with their shortcomings/risks and possible solutions/alternatives.

AB Background: A barrier to influenza vaccination is the misperception that the inactivated vaccine can cause influenza. Previous studies have investigated the risk of acute respiratory illness (ARI) after influenza vaccination with conflicting results. We assessed whether there is an increased rate of laboratory-confirmed ARI in post-influenza vaccination periods. Methods: We conducted a cohort sub-analysis of children and adults in the MoSAIC community surveillance study from 2013 to 2016. Influenza vaccination was confirmed through city or hospital registries. Cases of ARI were ascertained by twice-weekly text messages to household to identify members with ARI symptoms. Nasal swabs were obtained from ill participants and analyzed for respiratory pathogens using multiplex PCR. The primary outcome measure was the hazard ratio of laboratory-confirmed ARI in individuals post-vaccination compared to other time periods during three influenza seasons. Results: Of the 999 participants, 68.8% were children, 30.2% were adults. Each study season, approximately half received influenza vaccine and one third experienced >= 1 ARI. The hazard of influenza in individuals during the 14-day post-vaccination period was similar to unvaccinated individuals during the same period (HR 0.96, 95% CI [0.60, 1.52]). The hazard of non-influenza respiratory pathogens was higher during the same period (HR 1.65, 95% CI [1.14, 2.38]); when stratified by age the hazard remained higher for children (HR 1.71, 95% CI [1.16, 2.53]) but not for adults (HR 0.88, 95% CI [0.21, 3.69]). Conclusion: Among children there was an increase in the hazard of ARI caused by non-influenza respiratory pathogens post-influenza vaccination compared to unvaccinated children during the same period. Potential mechanisms for this association warrant further investigation. Future research could investigate whether medical decision-making surrounding influenza vaccination may be improved by acknowledging patient experiences, counseling regarding different types of ARE, and correcting the misperception that all ARI occurring after vaccination are caused by influenza.

AB Background: Non-specific effects (NSEs) of vaccines have increasingly gained attention in recent years. Recent studies suggest that live vaccines, such as measles vaccine (MV), have beneficial effects on health, while inactivated vaccines, such as the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) vaccine, may have harmful effects. If this is the case, it should improve child health to move MV closer to the last vaccination with DTP. The objective of this study was to investigate the NSEs of an additional early dose of MV on hospitalization or mortality. Methods: Children were randomized to receive either the standard MV at 9 months (control) or an additional early dose of MV 4 weeks after the third dose of DTP-containing Pentavalent vaccine and the standard MV at 9 months (intervention). In this analysis of a secondary outcome in the trial, we investigated the effect of the intervention on a composite endpoint of over-night hospitalization with or without recovery, or death without previous hospitalization, in children between 4.5 and 36 months of age in the Nouna HDSS in Burkina Faso. We used Cox proportional hazards regression with repeated events and time since study enrolment as underlying time-scale. Results: Among 2258 children in the intervention and 2238 children in the control group we observed a total of 464 episodes of hospitalization or mortality. There was no difference between intervention and control group (HR = 1.00, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.83-1.20). Results from the per-protocol and intention-to-treat analysis were similar. Although no significant, results suggest a possible beneficial effect of early MV in children that had not been exposed to an OPV campaign after enrolment (HR = 0.83, 95% CI 0.55-1.29). Conclusions: We did not detect any effect of early MV on subsequent hospitalization or mortality. However, possible effects of early MV could have been obscured by NSEs of the frequent OPV campaigns.

AB Canine leishmaniosis is a zoonotic disease caused by Leishmania infantum. Extensive research is currently ongoing to develop safe and effective vaccines to protect from disease development. The European Commission has granted a marketing authorization for LetiFend (R), a new vaccine containing recombinant Protein Q The efficacy of LetiFend (R) vaccination in a large-scale dog population of both sexes, different breeds and ages in endemic areas is reported in this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled field trial. Dogs (n = 549) living in France and Spain were randomly selected to receive a single subcutaneous dose of LetiFend (R) or placebo per year, and were naturally exposed to two L infantum transmission seasons. Clinical examinations, blood and lymphoid organ sampling to evaluate serological, parasitological and disease status of the dogs were performed at different time points during the study. LetiFend (R) was very well tolerated and clearly reduced the incidence of clinical signs related to leishmaniosis. The number of confirmed cases of leishmaniosis was statistically significantly lower in the vaccine group. The number of dogs with parasites was close to be significantly reduced in the vaccine group (p = 0.0564). Re-vaccination of seropositive dogs demonstrated to be safe and not to worsen the course of the disease. The likelihood that a dog vaccinated with LetiFend (R) develops a confirmed case or clinical signs of leishmaniosis in areas with high pressure is, respectively, 5 and 9.8 time less than that for an unvaccinated dog. Thus, the overall efficacy of the LetiFend (R) vaccine in the prevention of confirmed cases of leishmaniosis in endemic areas with high disease pressure was shown to be 72%. In conclusion, this field trial demonstrates that LetiFend (R) is a novel, safe and effective vaccine for the active immunization of non-infected dogs from 6 months of age in reducing the risk of developing clinical leishmaniosis after natural infection with Leishmania infantum.

AB Background: Between 2007 and 2011, opportunistic HPV-vaccination was available in Sweden and partially subsidized to girls aged 13-17, reaching a similar to 30% overall coverage. Methods: All Swedish women/men aged 15-44 were followed between 2006 and 2012 for condyloma. Average annual percent changes (AAPCs) in incidence were estimated. Results: Substantial decreases were seen in women aged 15-24 from 2008-onwards (AACP-range: -8.5% to -18.5%); similar effects were seen for men aged 15-29 (AACP-range: -7.0% to -16.6%) from 2010-onwards. Discussion: Despite low population vaccination coverage in women and no coverage in men, similar condyloma incidence reductions were observed among men and women, with delays of >1 years in men.

AB Background: Afghanistan is one of the remaining wild-poliovirus (WPV) endemic countries. We conducted a seroprevalence survey of anti poliovirus antibodies in Kandahar Province. Methods: Children in two age groups (6-11 months and 36-48 months) visiting Mirwais hospital in Kandahar for minor ailments unrelated to polio were enrolled. After obtaining informed consent, we collected venous blood and conducted neutralization assay to detect poliovirus neutralizing antibodies. Results: A total of 420 children were enrolled and 409/420 (97%) were analysed. Seroprevalence to poliovirus type 1 (PV1) was 97% and 100% in the younger and older age groups respectively; it was 71% and 91% for PV2; 93% and 98% for PV3. Age group (RR = 3.6, CI 95% = 2.2-5.6) and place of residence outside of Kandahar city (RR =1.8, CI 95% = 1.2-2.6) were found to be significant risk factors for seronegativity. Conclusions: The polio eradication program in Kandahar achieved high serological protection, especially against PV1 and PV3. Lower PV2 seroprevalence in the younger age group is a result of a withdrawal of live type 2 vaccine in 2016 and is expected. Ability to reach all children with poliovirus vaccines is a prerequisite for achieving poliovirus eradication. (C) 2018 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB African horse sickness virus (AHSV) is a virus species in the genus Orbivirus of the family Reoviridae. Currently, nine serotypes have been defined showing limited cross neutralization. AHSV is transmitted by species of Culicoides biting midges and causes African Horse Sickness (AHS) in equids with a mortality up to 95% in naive domestic horses. AHS has become a serious threat for countries outside Africa, since endemic Culicoides species in moderate climates are competent vectors of closely related bluetongue virus. AHS outbreaks cause huge economic losses in developing countries. In the developed world, outbreaks will result in losses in the equestrian industry and will have an enormous emotional impact on owners of pet horses. Live-attenuated vaccine viruses (LAVs) have been developed, however, safety of these LAVs are questionable due to residual virulence, reversion to virulence, and risk on virulent variants by reassortment between LAVs or with field AHSV. Research aims vaccines with improved profiles. Reverse genetics has recently being developed for AHSV and has opened endless possibilities including development of AHS vaccine candidates, such as Disabled Infectious Single Animal (DISA) vaccine. Here, virulent AHSV5 was recovered and its high virulence was confirmed by experimental infection of ponies. 'Synthetically derived' virulent AHSV5 with an in-frame deletion of 77 amino acids codons in genome segment 10 encoding NS3/NS3a protein resulted in similar in vitro characteristics as published NS3/ NS3a knockout mutants of LAV strain AHSV4LP. In contrast to its highly virulent ancestor virus, this deletion AHSV5 mutant (DISA5) was completely safe for ponies. Two vaccinations with DISA5 as well as two vaccinations with DISA vaccine based on LAV strain AHSV4LP showed protection against lethal homologous AHSV. More research is needed to further improve efficacy, to explore the AHS DISA vaccine platform for all nine serotypes, and to study the vaccine profile in more detail. (C) 2018 The Author(s).

AB Background: The ten-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV10) was introduced into the Finnish National Vaccination Programme (NVP) in September 2010. The impact of PCV10 vaccination against invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in vaccine-eligible children has been high. We evaluated the long-term impact of PCV10 vaccination against IPD in vaccine-eligible and older, unvaccinated children six years after PCV10 introduction with a special focus on cross-protection against PCV10-related serotypes (serotypes in the same serogroups as the PCV10 types). Methods: We used data on IPD from the national, population-based surveillance. A target cohort of vaccine-eligible children (born June 2010 or later) was followed from 3 months of age until the end of 2016. For the indirect effect, another cohort of older PCV10-ineligible children was followed from 2012 through 2016. IPD rates were compared with those of season- and age-matched reference cohorts before NVP introduction. Results: Among vaccine-eligible children, the incidence of all IPD decreased by 79% (95% CI 74-83%). There was a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of 6A IPD, but for 19A, the reduction was non-significant and the incidence of 19A increased towards the end of the study period in the older vaccine-eligible children. The increase in non-PCV10 related serotypes was non-significant. Results: In the unvaccinated older children, the incidence of all IPD decreased by 33% (95% CI 8-52%) compared to the reference cohort, and there was no impact on serotype 6A or 19A IPD. Conclusion: Overall, the impact of PCV10 vaccination on IPD was high in vaccine-eligible children, with a major reduction in vaccine-type disease, and without notable replacement by other serotype groups. Our data suggest that PCV10 results in long-lasting direct cross-protection against 6A IPD. For 19A, no net reduction was observed six years after NVP introduction in the vaccine-eligible cohort. The indirect impact on IPD in unvaccinated children sustained. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Streptococcus agalactiae (GBS) is a leading cause of neonatal sepsis and meningitis in many countries. This study aimed to determine the molecular characteristics of GBS colonized in mothers and their infants so as to provide implication for vaccine strategies and confirm vertical transmission. Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted to recruit 1815 mother-neonate pairs. All GBS isolates from pregnant women and her infants were tested for serotypes, multilocus sequence types and virulence genes. The relationship between multiple molecular characteristics of GBS isolates was tested by the correspondence analysis, and the agreement between mother-neonate paired data in molecular characteristics was analyzed using Kappa tests. Results: The predominant serotypes were III, Ia and V, and the most prevalent sequence types (STs) were ST19, ST17, ST10, and ST12. All isolates carried at least one pilus island (PI). The most common combination of PIs was PI-2b alone, followed by PI-1+PI-2a and PI-2a alone, and the most prevalent alpha-like protein (alp) genes were rib, epsilon and alphaC. Moreover, a strong relationship was noted between STs, serotypes, alp genes and PIs, including ST17 associated with serotype-III/rib/PI-2b, ST19 with serotype-III/rib/PI-1+PI-2a, and ST485 with serotype-Ia/epsilon/PI-2b. The rate of GBS vertical transmission was 14.1%, and the kappa test revealed good agreement in multiple molecular characteristics among GBS-positive mother-neonate pairs. Notably, the switching of molecular characteristics was found during vertical transmission. Conclusions: Our findings underscore the value of monitoring multiple molecular characteristics so as to provide implication for multivalent strategies and gain insights into GBS vertical transmission and vertical characteristic switching.

AB Fasciolosis continues to be a major cause of economic losses in the livestock industry and a growing threat to humans. The limited spectrum of effective anthelmintics and the appearance of resistances urge the need for developing an effective vaccine. Most studies have been focused on the use of TH1 -polarizing adjuvants and the use of recombinant Fasciola critical molecules and, despite the efforts, no reproducible protections have been achieved. The F. hepatica MF6p/FhHOM-1 protein is a heme-binding protein also reported to have immunomodulatory properties, constituting a promising target for vaccination and/or as target for the development of new flukicides. Thus, in this study, we investigated the effects of the THl -polarizing adjuvant Quil A((R)) on sheep immune response to MF6p/FhHDM-1, and the vaccine potential of both native and synthetic forms of this protein against ovine fasciolosis. Subcutaneous injection of Quil A((R)) alone, i.e., without co-injecting any antigen, expands the antibody repertoire to MF6p/FhHDM-1 triggered by a subsequent primoinfection with metacercariae. This effect was not observed with aluminum hydroxide, the most frequently adjuvant used in commercial vaccines. On the other hand, vaccination with synthetic MF6p/FhHDM-1 in Quil A((R)) prompted a 2-4-week delay in the antibody response induced in sheep by a challenge experimental infection. Moreover, fluke populations stablished showed stunted growth and low antigen release probably due to reduced metabolic activity. These observations suggest that primary circulating antibodies induced by the immunization had harmful effects on fluke development. Such effects could not be demonstrated to be associated to TH1 immune response linked events (production of IgG(2) isotype antibodies and IFN-gamma). (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To systematically investigate the prevalence and genetic characteristics of 4CMenB and rLP2086 vaccine candidates among Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B (NmB) in China. Methods: A total of 485 NmB strains isolated in 29 provinces of China between 1968 and 2016 were selected from the culture collection of the national reference laboratory according to the isolation year, location, and source. Multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) and porA gene sequencing were performed on all 485 study strains; PCR was used to detect the fHbp, nadA, and nhba gene of 432 strains; positive amplification products from the fHbp and nadA genes from all strains, as well as those of the nhba gene from 172 representative strains, were sequenced. Results: MLST results showed that the predominant (putative) clonal complexes (CCs) of NmB isolates have changed over time in China. While strains that could not be assigned to existing (p)CCs were the biggest proportion, CC4821 was the most prevalent lineage (36.0%) since 2005. PCR and sequence analysis revealed that the 4CMenB and rLP2086 vaccine candidates were highly diverse. Respectively, 152 PorA genotypes and 83 VR2 sequences were identified with significant diversity within a single CC; the complete nadA gene was found in ten of 432 study strains; fHbp was present in most strains (422/432) with variant 2 predominating (82.9%) in both patient- and carrier- derived isolates; almost all strains harbored the nhba gene while sequences were diverse. Conclusions: With regards to clonal lineages and vaccine candidate proteins, NmB isolates from China were generally diverse. Further studies should be performed to evaluate the cross-protection of present vaccines against Chinese NmB strains. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB European badgers (Meles meles) are a wildlife reservoir for Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis) in parts of England, Wales and Ireland, constituting a potential source of tuberculosis (TB) infection for cattle. Vaccination of badgers against TB is one of the tools available for helping reduce the prevalence of bovine TB in badgers, made possible by the licensing in 2010 of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine for intramuscular administration to badgers (BadgerBCG). However, practical limitations associated with administering an injected vaccine to wild animals make an oral, bait-delivered form of the vaccine highly desirable. Evaluation of the safety of oral BCG to badgers and the environment is a mandatory step on the road to licensing an oral vaccine. This study had the following objectives: (a) to determine whether adverse effects followed the oral administration of BCG vaccine to badgers; (b) to measure the quantity and frequency of BCG excreted in the faeces of vaccinated badgers; and (c) to assess whether there was evidence of the vaccine spreading to unvaccinated, 'sentinel' badgers sharing the same environment as vaccinated animals. We report here that the oral administration per badger of >= 6.4 x 10(9) cfu BCG, followed 14 days later by a single oral dose of >= 6.4 x 10(7) cfu BCG caused no adverse physical effects and did not affect the social behaviour and feeding habits of the vaccinated animals. BCG was cultured from the faeces of two of nine vaccinated animals (372 cfu/g and 996 cfu/g, respectively) approximately 48 h after the higher dose of BCG was administered and by one of the nine vaccinated animal (80 cfu/g) approximately 24 h after receiving the lower dose of BCG. We found no evidence for the transmission of BCG to unvaccinated, sentinel, badgers housed with the vaccinated animals despite the occasional excretion of BCG in faeces.

AB Background: Influenza vaccine acceptance among healthcare workers (HCWs) is a worldwide problem, but relatively little research has focussed on Asia, including Singapore. Despite widespread access and recommendations from public health authorities, influenza vaccine uptake remains suboptimal among HCWs. Methods: Our qualitative study used focus group discussions to identify and explain factors limiting influenza vaccine acceptance among HCWs in Singapore. A total of 73 doctors, nurses, allied health and ancillary staff across three public hospitals were included. Results: Challenges identified include a fear of contracting influenza from vaccination exacerbated by negative anecdotes regarding vaccine safety and efficacy, distrust of published efficacy data, uncertainty regarding relevance of existing data for Singapore, reluctance to introduce chemicals or overmedicate, pain from injection, low risk attributed to influenza and limited awareness of influenza transmission with a preference for alternatives in patient protection. Differences in attitudes were observed across vocational groups. Lack of overt promotion by hospital leadership in some institutions, perceived vaccine hesitancy among doctors, access, and work culture that implicitly encourages working through illness were further barriers. Conclusion: Our findings highlight a combination of misperceptions about influenza vaccination and cognitive biases at the individual level, and challenges at the institutional level limiting uptake. Findings indicate an urgent need to provide targeted education and communication. Rather than providing more data, we recommend a widely-disseminated, locally-compiled synthesis addressing specific concerns of hesitant HCWs. Tailoring interventions to specific vocational groups should be considered. Institutional norms and culture may have a powerful influence in setting default behaviours: more effort is needed in improving influenza vaccine promotion and priority at some institutions, integrating vaccine-related communication with other infection control communication and addressing influenza vaccine hesitancy among doctors as a priority. Finally, further study of strategies to address cognitive biases affecting influenza vaccine acceptance in Singapore is desirable. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Objective: To evaluate early and long term anamnestic response to a booster dose of HBV vaccine among non-seroprotected children. Subjects and method: A national community based project was carried out on 3600 children aged 9 months to 16 years, fully vaccinated during infancy. They were recruited from 6 governorates representing Egypt. It revealed that 1535 children (42.8%) had non sero-protective anti-HBs (<10 IU/L) and were HBsAg or anti-HBc negative. A challenging dose of 10 mu g of mono-valent Euvax HBV vaccine was given to 1121/1535 children. Quantitative assessment of anti-HBs was performed to detect early (2-4 weeks) and long term (one year) anamnestic responses. Results: Early anamnestic response developed among 967/1070 children (90.3%).Children having detectable anti-HBs (1-9 IU/L) significantly developed early anamnestic response (90%) compared to 85% with undetectable anti-HBs (<1 IU/L), P < 0.001. Multiple logistic analysis revealed that undetectable anti-HBs, living in rural residence and children aged 15-16 years were the most significant predicting risk factors for the absence of early anamnestic response (<10 IU/L), with AOR 2.7, 2.7 & 4.7 respectively. After one year, long term anamnestic response was absent among 15% of children who previously showed early response. Poor early anamnestic response and undetectable pre-booster anti-HBs were the significant predicting risk factors for absent long term anamnestic response, with AOR 18.7 & 2.7 respectively. Conclusion: Immunological memory for HBV vaccine outlasts the presence of anti- HBs and HBV vaccination program provides effective long term protection even in children showing waning or undetectable concentrations of anti-HBs. This signifies no need for a booster dose especially to healthy children. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: During a pertussis epidemic in 2009, the Department of Health, Victoria, Australia, implemented a cocoon program offering parents of new babies a funded-dose of pertussis-containing vaccine. We assessed vaccine effectiveness (VE) of the program in reducing pertussis infection in infants. Methods: Using a matched case-control design, infants aged <12 months that were notified with pertussis between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2011, and born during the time that the cocoon program was in place, were identified. Controls were matched by area of residence and date of birth. Telephone interviews we conducted to ascertain parents' vaccination status, and if vaccinated, timing of vaccination receipt relative to the birth of their baby. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated for the association between vaccination and pertussis infection, with VE calculated as (1 - OR) x 100%. Results: The study recruited 215 cases and 240 controls (response rates 67% and 25% of eligible participants, respectively). Vaccination of both parents after delivery of the infant and >= 28 days prior to illness onset reduced pertussis infection by 77% (Vaccine Effectiveness [VE] = 77% (confidence interval [95% CI], 18-93%). After adjusting for maternal education, presence of a sibling within the household, and the infants' primary course vaccination status, the adjusted VE was 64% (95% CI, -58-92%). Conclusions: Although not reaching statistical significance, our results demonstrated that cocoon immunisation - where both parents are vaccinated in the post-partum period - may offer some protection again infant pertussis infection. Cocoon immunisation could be considered in circumstances where antenatal vaccination of the mother has not occurred. Crown Copyright (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB FMDV serotype SAT2 is most frequently associated with outbreaks in ruminants. However, the risk of it spreading from cattle to pigs cannot be excluded. To assess the efficacy of an SAT2-type FMD inactivated vaccine against homologous challenge in pigs, a suitable challenge strain adapted to pigs was produced. After two passages in two pigs each, a FMDV stock of SAT2 challenge strain was produced. This material was used to infect two groups of five pigs. The first group being vaccinated 28 days before challenge and the other one left as an unvaccinated control. Clinical signs were recorded, virus shedding was assessed on mouth swabs, and neutralising antibody titres were determined. At least 80% of the vaccinated pigs were protected against clinical disease. Furthermore, no virus shedding was observed in any of the vaccinated pigs. This study shows that experimentally inoculated pigs can become infected with a SAT2 serotype. Furthermore, vaccination offers protection against generalisation and viral excretion, confirming the potential of vaccination as an important tool in the control of FMD in pigs.

AB Introduction: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is pivotal in tumor angiogenesis and therapies targeting the VEGF axis are widely used in the clinic for the treatment of cancer. We have developed a therapeutic vaccine targeting human (h)VEGF(165) . hVEGF(26).(104)/RFASE is based on the truncated protein hVEGF(26).(104) as antigen formulated in an oil-in-water emulsion containing the sulpholipopolysaccharide RFASE as adjuvant. Here we describe the toxicity and immunogenicity of this therapeutic vaccine in cynomolgus monkeys.
   Methods: In total 54 cynomolgus monkeys were used and divided in 7 groups. Groups 1-3 were control groups, either receiving PBS alone (group 1), RFASE alone (group 2) or hVEGF (26).(404) alone (group 3). Animals allocated to groups 4-7 received hVEGF(26-104) together with RFASE, but with varying doses of the antigen or the adjuvant. All animals were immunized four times with 2-week intervals and safety and immunogenicity were monitored until 3 days after the final immunization.
   Results: Immunization induced an RFASE adjuvant dependent acute phase response. High titers of antibodies against hVEGF(26-104) and cross-reactive with hVEGF(165) , were found in monkey sera, 28 days after primer immunization. These antibodies were able to inhibit the binding of the monoclonal antibody bevacizumab with hVEGF(165) in a competition ELISA. Moreover, the biological activity of hVEGF(165) could be inhibited by the addition of immunized monkey serum in a VEGF specific bioassay. Importantly, no adverse events commonly observed with VEGF neutralization were observed throughout the study.
   Conclusion: These data show that hVEGF(26).(104)/RFASE can be safely administered in cynomolgus monkeys, induces the desired immune response and therefore support the clinical development of this vaccine. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background and objectives: Ontario introduced a universal publicly-funded group A rotavirus (RVA) immunization program in August 2011, using monovalent vaccine. RVA immunization programs have decreased the incidence of RVA acute gastroenteritis in many countries but it is unclear if it will contribute to the emergence of certain genotypes. We monitored RVA trends and genotypes in Ontario before and after implementation of the publicly-funded immunization program.
   Methods: RVA detection was conducted at Public Health Ontario Laboratories from January 2009 to December 2011 (pre-program period) and January 2012 to October 2015 (publicly-funded RVA immunization program period) and number of RVA-positive specimens and percent positivity were analysed. A convenience sample of RVA-positive stool specimens, from September 2010 to December 2011 (pre-program period) and January 2012 to June 2013 (program period), were genotyped using heminested PCR. A literature review on the burden of illness from emergent genotype was performed.
   Results: Stool specimens showed a significant decrease in RVA percent positivity from the 36 month preprogram period (14.4%; 1537/10700) to the 46 month program period (6.1%; 548/9019). An increase in the proportion of RVA G10 among genotyped specimens, associated with five different P genotypes, from the pre-program (6.3%; 13/205) to the program (31.5%; 40/127) period was observed. Our literature review identified approximately 200 G10-positive human stool specimens from 16 different countries.
   Conclusions: This study documented a decrease in the number of RVA-positive specimens and percent positivity after implementation of the immunization program. An unexpected increase in the proportion of RVA G10 was detected following program introduction. Ongoing RVA surveillance is important in evaluating both the long-term impact of immunization and emergence of RVA genotypes. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: We undertook an open-label, uncontrolled study of investigational recombinant botulinum vaccine for botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) serotypes A and B (rBV A/B) to assess its safety and immunogenicity in healthy volunteers who had been previously immunized with investigational pentavalent botulinum toxoid. Study participants who wished to do so could donate their hyperimmune plasma for production of Human Botulism Immune Globulin Intravenous (BIG-IV, BabyBIG((R))).
   Study design: A single 0.5 ml (mL), 40-microgram intramuscular injection of rBV A/B was administered to study participants. Post-vaccination sera collected at approximately 2-week intervals were evaluated for anti-BoNT/A and anti-BoNT/B neutralizing antibody concentrations (NAC). Local and systemic treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were identified by clinical and laboratory monitoring for 12 weeks post-vaccination with a final telephone follow-up for additional safety assessment at 6 months. The primary endpoint for immunogenicity was a >= 4-fold rise in NAC in >= 50% of participants by Week 4 postvaccination.
   Results: All 45 enrolled participants completed the study. Forty-two of 45 participants (93.3%) experienced at least one TEAE. Overall, 138 of 218 (63.3%) reported TEAEs were treatment-related, the majority of which were mild injection-site reactions. No serious or unexpected adverse events occurred. The study achieved its primary immunogenicity endpoint with 37/45 (82.2%) participants and 39/45 (86.7%) participants having a >= 4-fold rise in NAC to anti-BoNT/A and to anti-BoNT/B, respectively, by Week 4 post-vaccination.
   Conclusion: A single 0.5 mL dose of rBV A/B was safe, well-tolerated and immunogenic in participants previously immunized with pentavalent botulinum toxoid. The tolerability and immunogenicity characteristics of rBV A/B vaccination of individuals with existing BoNT immunity support its potential future use to provide occupational protection to botulism laboratory workers. Almost all study participants donated hyperimmune plasma for production of BIG-IV. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Poxviruses are complex dsDNA viruses with over 200 genes, many of them with unknown role in the stimulation of immune responses. Among these, the vaccinia virus (VACV) L3L ORF encodes an essential protein for the transcription of the VACV early genes. To the best of our knowledge, the immune response elicited by L3 has not been characterized. In this regard, our data describes a DNA L3-coding plasmid (pL3L) that stimulates both, humoral- and cell-mediated immune responses in a mouse model. Cellmediated immune responses were measured by IFN-gamma and IL-4 ELISPOT assays. We performed CD8(+) cells depletion and flow cytometry analysis to account for the contribution of cytotoxic T lymphocytes in the IFN-gamma production. Moreover, results from ELISPOT were confirmed by measuring the concentration of IL-4 and IFN-gamma in supernatant of antigen-stimulated splenocytes by cytokine ELISA. Additionally, dominant antigenic regions of L3 protein were identified by epitope mapping analysis. Humoral immune responses were assessed by ELISA. Specifically, the production of total IgG, IgGI (TH-2) and IgG2a (TH-1) were determined one week after the final immunization. Our ELISPOT data shows pL3L-immunized animals to produce significantly higher frequencies of IFN-gamma Spot-Forming Cells (SFC) versus controls. IL-4 levels remained unchanged in all three groups, demonstrating the increase in antigen-specific IFN-gamma releasing cells. Flow cytometry assay results showed that CD8(+) T cells are a major contributor to the production of IFN-gamma. Moreover, our formulation enhances the production of total IgG, predominantly IgG2a isotype. Immunization with pL3L promotes a robust cytotoxic immune response, crucial against viral pathogens. In addition, our vaccine candidate promotes an increase in IgG levels, especially IgG2a (TH-1 type). Our data encourages further studies of L3 as a novel antigen in vaccine development against poxviruses. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The investigation of the glassy state of 5-ethyl-5-methylhydantoin (i.e. 12H, a chiral Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient) was attempted by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Fast Scanning Calorimetry (FSC). This compound exhibits a high crystallization propensity for every enantiomeric composition. Nevertheless, glassy states of pure enantiomer or mixtures between enantiomers were successfully reached by FSC at cooling rates of: 1000 degrees C/s and 300 degrees C/s respectively, even though limitations on the sampling reproducibility were evidenced due to FSC sample size. The Glass Forming Ability (GFA) was proven to increase with the counter-enantiomer content. From the glassy state, pure enantiomer displayed a more pronounced crystallogenic character (with a crystallization occurring 36 degrees C below Tg during ageing) than that of the mixture between enantiomers. Ageing of amorphous 12H promotes a strong nucleation behavior in both samples but enantiopure 12H crystallizes upon ageing while scalemic 12H evolves towards the metastable equilibrium. Finally, potential new phase equilibria (previously not reported) in the enantiomeric phase diagram could have been highlighted by FSC by recrystallization from the amorphous state.

AB Precise filling of capsules with doses in the mg-range requires a good understanding of the filling process. Therefore, we investigated the various process steps of the filling process by dynamic and static mode tests. Dynamic tests refer to filling of capsules in a regular laboratory dosator filling machine. Static tests were conducted using a novel filling system developed by us. Three grades of lactose excipients were filled into size 3 capsules with different dosing chamber lengths, nozzle diameters and powder bed heights, and, in the dynamic mode, with two filling speeds (500, 3000 caps/h). The influence of the gap at the bottom of the powder container on the fill weight and variability was assessed. Different gaps resulted in a change in fill weight in all materials, although in different ways. In all cases, the fill weight of highly cohesive Lactohale 220 increased when decreasing the gap. Furthermore, experiments with the stand-alone static test tool indicated that this very challenging powder could successfully be filled without any pre-compression in the range of 5 mg-20 mg with acceptable RSDs. This finding is of great importance since for very fine lactose powders high compression ratios (dosing-chamber-length-to-powder-bed height compression ratios) may result in jamming of the piston. Moreover, it shows that the static mode setup is suitable for studying fill weight and variability.
   Since cohesive powders, such as Lactohale 220, are hard to fill, we investigated the impact of vibration on the process. Interestingly, we found no correlation between the reported fill weight changes in dynamic mode at 3000 cph and static mode using similar vibration. However, we could show that vibrations during sampling in the static mode dramatically reduced fill weight variability.
   Overall, our results indicate that by fine-tuning instrumental settings even very challenging powders can be filled with a low-dose dosator capsule filling machine. This study is a further step towards a scientific qualification of dosator nozzles for low-fill weight (1-45 mg) capsule filling.

AB Recent evidence has continued to support the applicability of progesterone in preventing preterm birth, hence the development of an appropriate vaginal delivery system for this drug would be of considerable interest. Here, we describe the development of progesterone-loaded bioadhesive nanofibers using pressurized gyration for potential incorporation into a vaginal insert, with a particular view to addressing the challenges of incorporating a poorly water-soluble drug into a hydrophilic nanofiber carrier. Polyethylene oxide and carboxymethyl cellulose were chosen as polymers to develop the carrier systems, based on previous evidence of their yielding mucoadhesive nanofibers using the pressurized gyration technique. The fabrication parameters such as solvent system, initial drug loading and polymer composition were varied to facilitate optimisation of fiber structure and efficiency of drug incorporation. Such studies resulted in the formation of nanofibers with satisfactory surface appearance, diameters in the region of 400 nm and loading of up to 25% progesterone. Thermal and spectroscopic analyses indicated that the drug was incorporated in a nanocrystalline state. Release from the drug-loaded fibers indicated comparable rates of progesterone dissolution to that of Cyclogest, a commercially available progesterone pessary, allowing release over a period of hours. Overall, the study has shown that pressurized gyration may produce bioadhesive progesterone-loaded nanofibers which have satisfactory loading of a poorly water-soluble drug as well as having suitable structural and release properties. The technique is also capable of producing fibers at a yield commensurate with practical applicability, hence we believe that the approach shows considerable promise for the development of progesterone dosage forms for vaginal application.

AB Lung cancer is the major cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Curcumin attracted attention due to its promising anti-cancer properties, however its poor aqueous solubility and bioavailability have to be overcome. In the current study curcumin is encapsulated in krill lipids-based liposomes (marinosomes) to develop a potential anticancer therapy from low-cost and readily available nutraceuticals. Reflux followed by thin drug-lipid film method is used successfully to incorporate the drug into the liposomal membrane at high encapsulation efficiency (EE). The curcumin-loaded marinosomes (CURMs) showed a powerful antioxidant activity (EC50 (sic) 4 mu g/mL). Additionally, CURMs exhibited good physicochemical and oxidative stability after eight weeks' storage at 4 degrees C. Furthermore, CURMs exhibited sustained release of about 30% of their curcumin content under in vitro culture conditions at 37 degrees C after 72 h. Consequently, CURMs showed its maximum cytotoxic effect (IC50; 11.7 +/- 0.24 mu g/ml) after incubation for 72 h against A549 lung cancer cells. Additionally, CURMs inhibited the proliferation of HUVECs in a dose-dependent manner with IC50 of 2.64 +/- 0.21 mu g/ml after incubation for 24 h. The current study presents the CURM as a favorable in vitro drug delivery system to target cancer disease.

AB Triggered drug release is a promising strategy for delivering anticancer drugs to cancer cells and tissues. We found that liposomes co-encapsulating calcein (a water-soluble model drug and fluorescence marker) and talaporfin sodium (TPS, a water-soluble photosensitizer) released the drug upon irradiation with a near-infrared (NIR)-laser. The liposomes were composed of phospholipid (DSPC)/helper lipid (DOPE)/cholesterol/PEG-lipid (PEG2000-DSPE) at a molar ratio of 85/10/5/5 and released a large amount of drug (70% < , within 10 min) upon irradiation, but no drug in the absence of NIR-laser irradiation and/or TPS. NIR-laser-triggered drug release was facilitated by the incorporation of DOPE into the liposomes, and the amount of DOPE incorporated affected drug leakage in the absence of NIR-laser-irradiation at 37 degrees C (body temperature). Drug leakage was tuned by incorporating cholesterol into the liposomes. NIR-laser-triggered drug release from the liposomes was confirmed using the anticancer drug gemcitabine. NIR-laser treatment of liposomes co-encapsulating gemcitabine and TPS provided the maximum cytotoxic effect towards EMT6/P cells. These results suggest that these novel light sensitive liposomes may be useful for drug delivery to cancer cells.

AB In this study, an inflammation-targeted delivery system based on a liposomal carrier was developed to deliver hydrophobic dexamethasone against arthritis. Using two FDA-approved excipients for intravenous injection, dexamethasone loaded liposome (Dex-Lip) was prepared by a thin-film hydration method. The biodistribution of 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindodicarbocyanine-loaded liposomes (DiD-Lips) were performed in rats with adjuvant-induced arthritis and demonstrated specific targeting efficacy in the disease site. DiD-Lips showed prolonged retention time in the inflammatory joint tissues compared with free DiD. Dex-Lips effectively suppressed the joint swelling in arthritis rats and significantly down-regulated serum pro-inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1 beta when compared to free dexamethasone. Furthermore, Dex-Lips had no significantly impact on the body weight, alleviated the hyperglycemia and improved haematological profiles of rheumatoid arthritis rats during the treatment process. Taken together, a safe liposomal delivery system was developed to achieve inflammation targeted therapy against arthritis.

AB The physical chemical properties of aqueous solutions of model compounds are illustrated in relation to hydration and solubility issues by using three perspectives: thermodynamic, spectroscopic and molecular dynamics simulations. The thermodynamic survey of the fundamental backgrounds of concentration dependence and experimental solubility results show some peculiar behavior of aqueous solutions with several types of similar solutes. Secondly, the use of a variety of experimental spectroscopic devices, operating under different experimental conditions of dimension and frequency, has produced a large amount of structural and dynamic data on aqueous solutions showing the richness of the information produced, depending on where and how the experiment is carried out. Finally, the use of molecular dynamics computational work is presented to highlight how the different types of solute functional groups and surface topologies organize adjacent water molecules differently. The highly valuable contribution of computer simulation studies in providing molecular explanations for experimental deductions, either of a thermodynamic or spectroscopic nature, is shown to have changed the current knowledge of many aqueous solution processes. While this paper is intended to provide a collective view on the latest literature results, still the presentation aims at a tutorial explanation of the potentials of the three methodologies in the field of aqueous solutions of pharmaceutical molecules.

AB Pulmonary delivery of protein therapeutics has considerable clinical potential for treating both local and systemic diseases. However, poor protein conformational stability, immunogenicity and protein degradation by proteolytic enzymes in the lung are major challenges to overcome for the development of effective therapeutics. To address these, a family of structurally related copolymers comprising polyethylene glycol, mPEG(2k), and poly (glutamic acid) with linear A-B (mPEG(2k)-lin-GA) and miktoarm A-B-3 (mPEG(2k)-mik-(GA)(3)) macromolecular architectures was investigated as potential protein stabilisers. These copolymers form non-covalent nanocomplexes with a model protein (lysozyme) which can be formulated into dry powders by spray-drying using common aerosol excipients (mannitol, trehalose and leucine). Powder formulations with excellent aerodynamic properties (fine particle fraction of up to 68%) were obtained with particle size (D-50) in the 2.5 mu m range, low moisture content (< 5%), and high glass transitions temperatures, i.e. formulation attributes all suitable for inhalation application. In aqueous medium, dry powders rapidly disintegrated into the original polymer-protein nanocomplexes which provided protection towards proteolytic degradation. Taken together, the present study shows that dry powders based on (mPEG(2k)-polyGA)-protein nanocomplexes possess potentials as an inhalation delivery system.

AB Celecoxib (CLX) is a selective COX-2 inhibitor with anticancer potential in a COX-2 dependent and independent manner. CLX's low water solubility has a dose limiting effect on its utilization in cancer treatment. Here, we developed liposomal drug delivery systems to allow a systemic administration and increase tumor accumulation of CLX based on the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) mechanism. Nine liposomal formulations has been prepared with different phospholipid compositions; among them three sets of liposomal formulations were selected based on characterization and stability for further studies. Anti-tumor effects of CLX-entrapped liposomal formulations were tested in vitro by cytotoxicity test and in vivo in BALB/c mice bearing C26 colon carcinoma. Biodistribution of liposomal-CLX has been studied by radiolabeling of CLX with I-125. The selected formulations had average size of about 100 nm, a narrow monomodal distribution with storage stability of at least one year at 4 degrees C. The HSPC/DSPG/cholesterol/DSPE-PEG2000/CLX (65/10/10/5/10M ratio) liposomal formulation had slowest release profile and greatest antitumor effects in vivo. This liposomal (ICLX)-C-125 formulation had a three times more accumulation in tumor site in comparison to the free (ICLX)-C-125. Liposomal CLX may serve as a safe, slow release and effective anti-tumor agent and merits further investigation.

AB Amorphous solid dispersions of itraconazole (ITZ) and copovidone (PVPVA 64) at 1:1 to 1:9 drug-polymer ratios were prepared using spray-drying (SD) and hot melt (HM) extrusion for comparative evaluation. Surface area normalized dissolution studies were carried out using a modified intrinsic dissolution rate (IDR) assembly and rate of release of drug as well as polymer were quantified using ultraviolet spectroscopy. The melt quenched amorphous form of ITZ provided an 18-fold dissolution advantage over the crystalline form. In general, dispersions prepared by either SD or HM showed similar dissolution profiles in terms of drug release. Both drugcontrolled and polymer-controlled ITZ dissolution rates were observed, depending on the drug loading, where a switch from a drug-controlled to a polymer-controlled regime was observed when the drug loading was approximately 20% or lower. The impact of the spray drying solvent composition was studied and found to have a large effect on the drug release rate for dispersions containing a drug loading of 20%. Electron microscopy showed differences in surface morphology (scanning) and internal structure (transmission) in these dispersions as a function of solvent system. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) revealed differences in the surface composition of drug and polymer whereby poorly dissolving systems showed drug enrichment. This study provides insight into the complex interplay between formulation, processing and performance of amorphous solid dispersion systems.

AB Compressibility and tablet forming ability (compactibility) of bimodal mixtures of differently sized granules formed from microcrystalline cellulose were studied experimentally and numerically with the discrete element method (DEM). Compression data was analysed using the Kawakita equation. A multi-body contact law that accounts for contact dependence resulting from plastic incompressibility/geometric hardening was used in the DEM simulations. The experimental Kawakita a and 1/b parameters both depended non-monotonically on composition (weight fraction of large particles). For the a parameter, this dependence was explained by variations in the porosity of the initial granule beds; for the 1/b parameter, other factors were found to be of importance as well. The numerical results generally compared favourably with the experiments, demonstrating the usefulness of the DEM at high relative densities, provided that a suitable multi-particle contact model is used. For all mixtures, the tensile strength of the formed tablets increased with increasing applied pressure. The tensile strength generally decreased with increasing fraction of large particle, and this decrease was more rapid for large differences in particle size. A possible interpretation of these findings was proposed, in terms of differences in lateral support of small particles in the vicinity of large particles.

AB The aim of this study is to develop nanosuspension of carvedilol (CRV) by wet media milling. Concentration of polymeric stabilizer (hydroxypropyl cellulose-HPC-SL), milling speed and size of milling beads were identified as critical formulation and process parameters and their effect on CRV particle size after 60 min of milling was assessed using a Box-Behnken experimental design. Optimized nanosuspension was solidified using spray drying and freeze drying and subjected to solid state characterization. Low stabilizer concentration (10%), low milling speed (300 rpm) with small milling beads (0.1 mm) were found as optimal milling conditions. Crystal lattice simulation identified potential slip plane within CRV crystals, where fractures are the most likely to occur. Calculated mechanical properties of CRV crystal indicates that low energy stress is sufficient to initiate fracture, if applied in the correct direction, explaining the advantage of using smaller milling beads. Only spray dried nanosuspension redispersed to original nanoparticles, while particle agglomeration during freeze drying prevented sample redispersion. Wet milling and spray drying did not induce polymorphic transition of CRV, while there is indication of polymorphic transition during freeze drying, making spray drying as the preferred solidification method.

AB The purpose of this work was to develop a D-alpha-tocopherol polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS) decorated nanodiamond (ND) system loading water-insoluble curcumin (ND/CUR/TPGS) to improve the colloidal dispersity and oral bioavailability of the preparation. CUR was physically loaded into ND clusters, then TPGS was coated to the ND/CUR complex forming amorphous nanostructure on the interparticle nanocage of the ND substrate. The formulation of the nanocomplexes was optimized using response surface methodology, and the optimal ND/CUR/TPGS showed small particle size (196.32 nm), high drug loading efficiency (81.59%) and coreshell structure. In vitro release study demonstrated that the nanocomplexes provided a sustained release behavior. The absorptive concentration of ND/CUR/TPGS was dramatically improved in total intestinal tract compared with CUR suspension, and the absorption was controlled by multiple transcytosis mechanisms. Furthermore, the pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that ND/CUR/TPGS had significantly higher C-max (4.50-fold), larger AUC(0-t) (10.67-fold), and longer MRT0-t (3.07-fold) in contrast with that of CUR suspension. Therefore, ND/CUR/TPGS presented great potential for oral delivery of insoluble and poorly permeable drugs.

AB The effects of tablet preparation and subsequent film coating with amorphous solid dispersion (ASD) particles that were composed of a drug with poor water solubility and hydrophilic polymers were investigated. ASD particles were prepared with a drug and vinylpyrrolidone-vinyl acetate copolymer (PVPVA) or polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) at a weight ratio of 1:1 or 1:2 using a melt extrusion technique. Tablets were prepared by conventional direct compression followed by pan coating. A mathematical model based on the Noyes-Whitney equation assuming that stable crystals precipitated at the changeable surface area of the solid-liquid interface used to estimate drug dissolution kinetics in a non-sink dissolution condition. All the ASD particles showed a maximum dissolution concentration approximately ten times higher than that of the crystalline drug. The ASD particles with PVPVA showed higher precipitation rate with lower polymer ratio, while PVP did not precipitate within 960 min regardless of the polymer ratio, suggesting the ASD particles of 1:1 drug: PVPVA (ASD-1) were the most unstable among the ASD particles considered. The dissolution of a core tablet with ASD-1 showed less supersaturation and a much higher precipitation rate than those of ASD-1 particles. However, a film-coated tablet or core tablet with a trace amount of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) showed a similar dissolution profile to that of the ASD-1 particles, indicating HPMC had a remarkable precipitation inhibition effect. Overall, these results suggest that tablet preparation with ASD may adversely affect the maintenance of supersaturation; however, this effect can be mitigated by adding an appropriate precipitation inhibitor to the formulation.

AB The rheological properties of petrolatum are dependent on both temperature and thermal history. How this thermal dependency can be explained is unclear. In the past it has been suggested that the structure of petrolatum consists of a three-dimensional crystalline network. This has been established using old microscopic techniques only. Therefore a study on the microstructure of petrolatum was conducted using rheometry, DSC, pulsed NMR, polarized light microscopy and synchrotron X-ray. The combination of these techniques show that petrolatum is composed of 21% solid material at room temperature. This consists of partly crystalline lamellar sheets which are packed in stacks. The occurrence of these lamellar sheets is temperature dependent and the number of lamellar stacks is dependent on thermal history. It was shown that rheological differences in petrolatum can be explained by the number of lamellar stacks present, where more lamellar stacks result in more rigid petrolatum.

AB In this review we will discuss recent advances in computational prediction of solubility in water-based solvents. Our focus is set on recent advances in predictions of biorelevant solubility in media mimicking the human intestinal fluids and on new methods to predict the thermodynamic cycle rather than prediction of solubility in pure water through quantitative structure property relationships (QSPR). While the literature is rich in QSPR models for both solubility and melting point, a physicochemical property strongly linked to the solubility, recent advances in the modelling of these properties make use of theory and computational simulations to better predict these properties or processes involved therein (e.g. solid state crystal lattice packing, dissociation of molecules from the lattice and solvation). This review serves to provide an update on these new approaches and how they can be used to more accurately predict solubility, and also importantly, inform us on molecular interactions and processes occurring during drug dissolution and solubilisation.

AB The doublesex and its homologue genes are important regulators of sexual differentiation which are conserved among animal kingdom. In the present study, we reported a doublesex gene (designated as FcDsx) identified from the Chinese shrimp F. chinensis. The gene structure, nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of FcDsx were characterized. The results showed that the deduced amino acid sequence of FcDsx had the common features of Dsx proteins, including a doublesex/male abnormal 3 (DM) domain, an oligomerization domain and a predicted monopartite nuclear localization signal. The expression patterns of FcDsx in different tissues and developmental stages were detected. FcDsx exhibited a sex-biased expression patterns in different tissues and its expression level increased along with developmental stages. In addition, its regulation on the expression of FcIAG, a gene important for sexual differentiation of male crustacean, was also analyzed. Putative Dsx binding site was identified on the promoter region of FcIAG and knockdown of FcDsx could reduce the expression of FcIAG, which suggested that FcDsx might be the upstream regulator of FcIAG. The present data indicated that FcDsx gene might involve in shrimp sexual differentiation process.

AB Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) belongs to the nuclear receptor superfamily of PPARs (PPAR alpha, PPAR beta/delta, PPAR gamma). Numerous studies have concentrated on the key role of PPARs in inflammation and a variety of cancers which include prostate, breast, glioblastoma, neuroblastoma, pancreatic, hepatic, leukemia, and bladder and thyroid tumors.
   This review, specifically deals with anti-tumor and tumorigenicity effects of PPAR gamma and its natural and synthetic agonists including Troglitazone, Cladosporol A, B, 15-Deoxi-Delta(12-14)-Prostaglondin J2 (15-d-PGJ2), Ciglitazon, docosahexaenoic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid Alpha-eleostreac acid, Amorfrutin C, Sphingosine 1-phosphate, Evodiamine, Excavatolide B vs respected antagonists as GW9662, bisphenol-A-diglycidyl-ether.
   Considering the contradictory role of PPAR gamma on tumorigenicity, a number of studies demonstrate mechanisms involved in tumorigenicity effects of PPAR gamma agonists while several studies suggest key roles of PPAR gamma agonists in anti-proliferation, metastasis, angiogenesis, apoptosis and immunomodulatory through activation of signaling pathways in different cancer cells as well as in cancer stem cells. The aim of this review is summarizing of tumorigenicity and anti-tumorigenicity activities of PPAR gamma agonists and antagonists as well as therapeutic activities of these reagents as a coadjutant drug in the treatment of different cancers.

ID MUTATIONS; VASCULOPATHY
AB Patients with co-occurrence of two independent pathologies pose a challenge for clinicians as the phenotype often presents as an unclear syndrome. In these cases, exome sequencing serves as a powerful instrument to determine the underlying genetic causes.
   Here, we present the case of a 4-year old boy with proteinuria, microhematuria, hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis, livedo-like rash, recurrent abdominal pain, anemia and continuously elevated CRP. Single exome sequencing revealed the pathogenic nonsense mutation p.(Arg98*) in the CLCN5 gene causing the X-linked inherited, renal tubular disorder Dent's disease. Furthermore, the two pathogenic and compound heterozygous missense variants p.(Gly47A1a) and p.(Pro251Leu) in the CECR1 gene could be identified. Mutations in the CECR1 gene are associated with a hereditary form of polyarteritis nodosa, called ADA2-deficiency. Both parents were carriers of a single heterozygous variant in CECR1 and the mother was carrier of the CLCN5 variant.
   This case evidently demonstrates the advantage of whole exome sequencing compared to single gene testing as the pathology in the CECR1 gene might have only been diagnosed after the occurrence of signs of systemic vasculitis like strokes or hemorrhages. Therefore, treatment and prevention can now start early to improve the outcome of these patients.

AB Background: Superoxide dismutase-2 (SOD2, OMIM: 147460) is involved in the detoxification of superoxide anions. The SOD2 mRNA level is down-regulated in cells exposed to morphine. Oxidative stress plays an important role in drug dependency. The rs2758339 (A/C) is located in the vicinity of SP1 and NF-kappa B transcription element sequences and the rs5746136 (A/G) creates a new glucocorticoid receptor binding site. Taken together, it is hypothesized that these polymorphisms might be associated with the risk of heroin dependency (HD) and the SOD2 expression level.
   Methods: To investigate the association between the SOD2 polymorphisms and the risk of HD, 442 heroin dependent persons and 799 healthy controls were included. This study also, consisted of 77 healthy students of Shiraz University (Iran) to investigate the association between the SOD2 polymorphisms and the gene expression level.
   Results: The AC (OR = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.56-0.93, P = 0.013) and CC (OR = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.45-0.92, P = 0.015) genotypes of the rs2758339 were negatively associated with the risk of HD. The AA genotype of the rs5746136 increased the risk of HD (OR = 1.46, 95% CI = 1.03-2.07, P = 0.031). The AA haplotype was associated with the risk of HD (OR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.09-1.58, P = 0.004). There was no relationship between the study genotypes (or diplotypes) and the SOD2 expression level.
   Conclusion: The rs2758339 and rs5746136 polymorphisms of the SOD2 are associated with the risk of HD but not associated with the SOD2 expression level.

AB In the present study, we identified seven major genes of oxalic acid biosynthesis pathway (SGAT, GGAT, ICL, GLO, MHAR, APO and OXO) from developing spike transcriptome of finger millet using rice as a reference. Sequence alignment of identified genes showed high similarity with their respective homolog in rice except for OXO and GLO. Transcript abundance (FPKM) reflects the higher accumulation of identified genes in GP-1 (low calcium genotype) as compared to GP-45 (high calcium genotype) which was further confirmed by qRT-PCR analysis, indicating differential oxalate formation in both genotypes. Determination of oxalic acid and tartaric acid content in developing spikes explain that higher oxalic acid content in GP-1 however, tartaric acid content was more in GP-45. Higher calcium content in GP-45 and lower oxalate accumulation may be due to the diversion of more ascorbic acid into tartaric acid and may correspond to less formation of calcium oxalate. Our results suggest that more than one pathway for oxalic acid biosynthesis might be present in finger millet with probable predominance of ascorbate-tartarate pathway rather than glyoxalate-oxalate conversion. Thus, finger millet can be use as an excellent model system for understanding more specific role of nutrients-antinutrients interactions, as evident from the present study.

AB Irisin is a novel secreted myokine, encoded by the fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5 (FNDC5) precursor gene. Irisin plays a role in the female reproductive system in pregnancy and in embryonic development, and is associated with fetal size. It is expressed in the ovary, placenta and neonatal cord serum. We studied whether maternal and neonatal FNDC5 genetic polymorphisms are associated with preterm birth (PTB). Blood for DNA analysis was collected from Israeli mothers (n = 315) and from umbilical veins of their respected idiopathic preterm (24-36 weeks) and control term (> 37 weeks) newborns (n = 161). Genotypes of maternal and neonatal FNDC5 polymorphisms (rs726344 and rs1746661) were determined by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Genotype-phenotype associations were analyzed using SPSS program. The Frequency of FNCD5 rs726344 G alleles in the Israeli cohort is 82%. We found significant FNCD5 rs726344 genotype frequencies control and PTB groups. Women bearing the FNDC5 rs726344 GG genotype had 2.18 fold ([CI] 1.193-4.008, p = 0.01) higher chance to deliver at term compared to both AG and AA genotypes (adjusting to age, gravidity, parity, weight percentile per gestational age and gender of newborn). Neonates carrying the FNDC5 rs726344 GG genotype had 2.24 fold ([CI] 0.979-5.134, p = 0.05) higher chance to be born at term compared to either AG or AA genotypes (adjusting to parity, previous abortions and weight percentile per gestational age). There was no significant association of the rs1746661 polymorphism with PTB. Thus, we determined FNDC5 polymorphisms frequencies in the Israeli population and demonstrated that maternal and neonatal FNDC5 rs726344 polymorphism is significantly associated with increased risk for PTB.

AB Anther cuticle and pollen exine are two elaborated lipid-soluble barriers protecting pollen grains from environmental and biological stresses. However, less is known about the mechanisms underlying the synthesis of these lipidic polymers. Here, we identified a no-pollen male-sterility mutant cyp703a3-3 from the indica restorer line Zhonghui 8015 (Zh8015) mutant library treated with 6 Coy-ray radiation. Histological analysis indicated that cyp703a3-3 underwent abnormal tapetal cells development, produced few orbicules and secreted less sporopollenin precursors to anther locule, as well as cutin monomers on anther. Genetic analysis revealed that cyp703a3-3 was controlled by a single recessive gene. Map-based cloning was performed to narrow down the mutant gene to a 47.78-kb interval on the chromosome 8 between two markers S15-29 and 515-30. Sequence analysis detected three bases (GAA) deletion in the first exon of LOC_Os08g03682, annotated as CYP703A3 with homologous sequences related to male sterility in Arabidopsis, causing the Asparagine deletion in the mutant site. Moreover, we transformed genomic fragment of CYP703A3 into cyp703a3-3, which male-sterility phenotype was recovered. Both the wild-type and cyp703a3-3 mutant 3D structure of CYP703A3 protein were modeled. Results of qPCR suggested CYP703A3 mainly expressed in anthers with greatest abundance at microspore stage, and genes involved in sporopollenin precursors formation and transportation, such as GAMYB, TDR, CYP70482, DPW2, OsABCG26 and OsABCG15, were significantly reduced in cyp703a3-3. Collectively, our results further elaborated CYP703A3 plays vital role in anther cuticle and pollen exine development in rice (Oryza sativa L.).

AB Ghrelin (GHRL) has important implications for liver disease. It has anti-inflammatory effects, regulates cell proliferation, modulates the fibrogenic response and protects liver tissue. Genetic variations in the GHRL gene may play a crucial role in the development of chronic hepatitis (CH), liver cirrhosis (LC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Therefore, we examined the association of GHRL gene polymorphisms (rs26312 and rs27647), and its serum level to virologic responses to combined sofosbuvir and Simeprevir therapy for a course of 12 successive weeks in Egyptian chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients. METHODS: Human genomic and clinical data were collected from 100 Egyptian participants in this study, 90 HCV patients who received sofosbuvir and Simeprevir and 10 non-HCV healthy subjects. Genotyping of GHRL rs26312 and rs27647, were determined with the TaqMan qRT-PCR allele detection assay. The serum GHRL concentrations were determined using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: GHRL polymorphisms (rs26312 and rs27647) genotype distributions and allele frequencies did not differ between HCV patients and normal healthy subjects or between patient groups when compared according to the therapeutic response. In addition, we found significant lower serum GHRL levels in CHC patients compared with the healthy controls. However, there was no significant association of the GHRL rs26312 and rs27647 polymorphisms with GHRL levels in CHC patients. We conclude that GHRL SNPs (rs26312 and rs27647) do not affect response to combined sofosbuvir and Simeprevir treatment in chronic Egyptian HCV patients.

AB We looked for differentially expressed MicroRNAs (miRNAs) in Immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN). Forty-eight miRNAs were identified through the initial screening phase (2 IgAN pools vs. 1 normal control (NC) pool) using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) based Exiqon panel (miRCURY-Ready-to-Use-PCR-Human-panel-I + II-V-1.M). By qRT-PCR, these miRNAs were further assessed in the training (32 IgAN VS. 31 NCs) and testing stages (51 IgAN VS. 51 NCs). The renal pathological lesions of patients with IgAN were evaluated according to Lees grading system. We discovered a plasma miRNA signature including four up-regulated miRNAs (miR-148a-3p, miR-150-5p, miR-20a-5p and miR-425-3p) and the areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) were 0.80 and 0.76 for the training and testing stage, respectively. The expression of the four miRNAs in IgAN grade I-II subgroups (according to Lees grading system) was obviously higher than that in IgAN grade III-V (P < .05). In summary, the plasma expression of miR-148a-3p, miR-150-5p, miR-20a-5p and miR-425-3p were up-regulated in patients with IgAN, especially the early-stage disease. Further studies are needed to explore the roles of the four miRNAs in the pathogenesis and progression of IgAN.

AB Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is defined as hyperglycemia detected during pregnancy and its risk is increased with obesity. Chemerin, an adipokine, has been proposed as potential mediators of insulin resistance in GDM. This case-control study was designed to assess the relation between chemerin SNPs rs4721 (or rs10278590) and rs17173608 and the development of GDM. One hundred thirty GDM pregnant women with GDM and 160 healthy pregnant women were enrolled in this study. The diagnosis of GDM was based on the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Group (IADPSG) criteria. Chemerin rs4721 polymorphism gene was amplified through PCR, and SNP was detected using restriction enzyme AluI. Genotyping for chemerin rs17173608 polymorphism was performed by using tetra-amplification refractory mutation system polymerase chain reaction (T-ARMS-PCR). Blood glucose level was measured by an enzymatic method. Our finding showed that the genotypes frequency of chemerin rs4721 polymorphism was significantly different between GDM and non-GDM groups (chi(2) = 7.44, P = 0.02). The genotype of rs4721 was significantly associated with GDM in co-dominant and dominant genotypes (GG vs GT, OR = 2.3, 95%CI = 1.24-4.24, P = 0.008, and GG vs GT + TT, OR = 2.21, 95%CI = 1.23-3.99, P = 0.008, respectively). No significant difference was observed in allele frequency between case and control groups (P = 0.62). Moreover, the genotypes and allele frequencies of chemerin rs17173608 polymorphism did not show significant differences between GDM and non-GDM (P > 0.05). We concluded that the genotype of rs4721 was found to contribute significant risk to GDM while genotype of rs17173608 could not predict the risk of GDM.

AB Interferon-gamma-inducible protein 30 (IFI30) is an IFN-gamma-inducible protein that is involved in MHC class II-restricted antigen processing and MHC class I-restricted cross-presentation pathways of adaptive immunity. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of porcine IFI30 expression on PRRSV proliferation in host cells. MARC-145 cells and pig Sertoli (ST) cells were infected with PRRSV after transfection with porcine IFI30 expression vectors and an empty vector. PRRSV copy numbers were analyzed by absolute real-time quantitative PCR, and the results showed that porcine IFI30 expression could significantly inhibit PRRSV transcription. Western blot analysis also determined that IFI30 expression could reduce the production of PRRSV M protein. Flow cytometric analysis indicated that the apoptosis of MARC-145 cells, which are non-porcine but highly permissive to PRRSV cells, was significantly decreased in the IFI30 expression group. In porcine ST cells, apoptosis was significantly increased in IFI30 knockdown cells but not in IFI30-overexpressing cells (**p < 0.01). In conclusion, porcine IFI30 expression may inhibit PRRSV proliferation and host cell apoptosis in vitro.

AB Sagittaria sagittifolia L is an important bulb vegetable that has high nutritional and medical value. Bulb formation and development are crucial to Sagittaria sagittifolia; however, its sucrose metabolism is poorly understood and there are a lack of sufficient transcriptomic and genomic data available to fully understand the molecular mechanisms underlying bulb formation and development as well as the bulb transcriptome.
   Five cDNA libraries were constructed at different developmental stages and sequenced using high-throughput Illumina RNA sequencing. From approximately 63.53 Gb clean reads, a total of 60,884 unigenes, with an average length of 897.34 bp and N50 of 1.368 kb, were obtained. A total of 36,590 unigenes were successfully annotated using five public databases. Across different developmental stages, 4195, 827, 832, 851, and 1494 were differentially expressed in T02, T03, T04, T05, and T06 libraries, respectively. Gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed several differentially-expressed genes (DEGs) associated with catalytic activity, binding, and transporter activity. The Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) revealed that these DEGs are involved in physiological and biochemical processes. RT-qPCR was used to profile the expression of these unigenes and revealed that the expression patterns of the DEGs were consistent with the transcriptome data.
   In this study, we conducted a comparative gene expression analysis at the transcriptional level using RNA-seq across the different developmental stages of Sagittaria sagittifolia. We identified a set of genes that might contribute to starch and sucrose metabolism, and the genetic mechanisms related to bulblet development were also explored. This study provides important data for future studies of the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying bulb formation and development in Sagittaria sagittifolia.

AB Ignition timing is an important parameter for spark-ignited engine. Hydrogen replenishment effectively improves the performance of engine. This paper experimentally investigated the impact of ignition timing on performance of a hydrogen-enriched n-butanol rotary engine. For this purpose, a rotary engine installed with a dual-fuel (hydrogen and n-butanol) port injection system was specially developed. An electronic management module was solely developed to control the fuel injection, excess air ratio and hydrogen proportion. In this experiment, the engine was run at 4000 rpm, an intake pressure of 35 kPa and an excess air ratio of 1.10. Hydrogen volume ratio was set at 0% and 3%, respectively. When hydrogen fraction was changed, n-butanol injection was also adjusted to make excess air ratio be 1.10. For 0% and 3% hydrogen addition, ignition timing was severally varied from 35 to 51 degrees CA BTDC and 29 to 45 degrees CA BTDC with an interval of 2 degrees CA. Experimental results showed that with the increase of ignition advance, both peak chamber pressure and temperature were increased, brake thermal efficiency was initially ascended and then declined. Flame development period was prolonged whereas flame propagation period was shortened as ignition advance increase. Cyclic variation was initially weakened and then deteriorated by advancing ignition. HC and NOx emissions were reduced after retarding ignition timing. Ignition timing had little influence on CO emission.

AB Thermodynamic analysis of a novel combined system, including geothermal driven dual fluid organic Rankine cycle (ORC), S-Graz cycle, proton exchange membrane electrolyzer (PEME) and methanol synthesis unit (MSU) are carried out using energy and exergy principles. The presented system produces zero emission power and hydrogen using oxy-fuel combustion technology and splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen in the PEME, which consumes the dual fluid ORC produced power. Then, methanol production from captured CO2 and produced H-2 is suggested to eliminate the captured CO2 from S-Graz cycle. The energy and exergy efficiencies and sustainability index of 14.7%, 42.43% and 1.737 are obtained for the presented cogeneration system, respectively. Also, results associated with the exergy destruction reveal that most of the destroyed exergy in the system is due to the dual fluid ORC in compare with the other units. Furthermore, it is observed that, within the dual fluid ORC, low pressure evaporator (LPE) is responsible for 33% of exergy destruction. Moreover, the results indicate that increasing higher pressure of the dual fluid ORC improves the system energetic and exergetic performance while an increment in geothermal hot water temperature leads to a reduction in system energy and exergy efficiencies.

AB Production of methyl esters from Pithecellobiwn duke seed oil (PDSO) is carried out through transesterification process. As free fatty acid (FFA) content in PDSO is 2.12%, alkaline based potassium hydroxide (KOH) catalyst is used for yielding methyl ester from PDSO. The effect of four process variables, such as molar ratio (oil: methanol), reaction temperature, catalyst loading and reaction time on the maximum yield of Pithecellobiwn duke seed oil methyl ester (PDSOME) is studied and process optimization has been executed using response surface methodology (RSM) based Box-Behnken design (BBD). An optimized PDSOME yield of 93.24% is achieved at 1:6 molar ratio, 60 degrees C reaction temperature, 0.8 wt.% catalyst and reaction time of 90 min. The estimated fuel properties of PDSOME met with the ASTM D6751 standards. Engine tests were conducted for PDSOME, its blends (20, 40, 60 and 80 vol.%) and compared with diesel. The drop in cylinder pressure, heat release rate (HRR) and exhaust gas temperature (EGT) were observed for the PDSOME and its blends. Brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) is increased and consequent reduction in brake thermal efficiency (BTE) is found for PDSOME and its blends. The exhaust emissions of CO, HC and NOx were decreased while CO2 and smoke intensity were increased with increase in PDSOME blending percentage in comparison with diesel fuel.

AB Combing PV with Thermoelectric (TE) would be dominant because it can employ the solar fully spectrum to produce electricity. But the TE efficiency is significantly lower than PV efficiency and the coupling effect between them will limit the performance of PV and TE. The analyze and comparison on the different characteristics among the hybrid module, the PV alone and TE alone is significant to obtain the highest the electrical efficiency. In this paper, the attention was paid to the inconsistent phenomenon of thermoelectric load resistance for photovoltaic-thermoelectric modules. The model of PV-TE was built and verified based on two types of PV cells. The load resistance of TE for the maximum power output was also analyzed under different working conditions for the TE alone, TE in the PV-TE and PV-TE. The results showed that the load resistance of TE for the maximum power output of the TE alone, TE in the PV-TE and PV-TE are all different. For example, the PV-TE module based on the c-Si cell attains its peak value at the load electrical resistance of TE of 0.75 Omega, while the internal electrical resistance of the TE is 0.47 Omega. The PV-TE module based on the GaAs cell shows a maximum efficiency of PV-TE with a load resistance of approximately 1.6 Omega, while the internal electrical resistance of the TE is 2.0 Omega. Referring to the load resistance of TE alone is not suitable for PV-TE maximum power output. In addition, the TE maximum power output does not correspond to the PV-TE maximum power output since the TE load resistances in these two conditions are also different. The study will provide the reference for attaining the correct load resistance for the actual maximum power output of PV-TE module.

AB Combined cooling and power system has gained extensive attention from government and publics throughout the world due to fuel saving, high energy utilization efficiency and different energy forms output. In this paper, a novel combined cooling and power system comprising a supercritical CO2 (sCO(2)) power cycle and a vapor absorption refrigeration cycle with lithium bromide as the working fluid is proposed. A comparative study is conducted between this system and the combined sCO(2)/ammonia-water system to show its advantages and potential on the basis of the self-built thermodynamic simulation platform. The influence of different variables including turbine inlet temperature, pressure ratio in sCO(2) cycle and evaporating temperature on the system performance is analyzed. Single-objective optimization relying on the genetic algorithm and multi-objective optimization based on the NSGA-II method are used to further investigate and compare the performance of above two cycles. Optimization results reveal that compared with the combined sCO(2)/ammonia-water system, the proposed sCO(2)/LiBr-H2O system could gain improvement on CORP by 0.3112 at the expensive of COPP drop by 0.0004 excepting the advantage of extreme low pump outlet pressure in bottoming cycle. Besides, sCO(2)/LiBr-H2O system is relatively easier to reach the balance between power and cooling.

AB This paper aims to computationally investigate the thermal effect, combining the internal heat and the ambient temperature, on the lithium (Li) dendrite growth process. To achieve this, the recently developed phase-field Li-dendrite model is further extended by coupling with a heat transfer model. The two models are linked via a temperature-dependent ion diffusion coefficient to investigate the evolution of the morphology and size of dendrites. Three levels of cases are used to progressively investigate the thermal effect on Li dendrites: (1) uniform ambient temperature, (2) temperature gradient along the charging direction, and (3) internal heat induced spatially distributed temperature. The results show that the normalized dendrite length decreases as the ambient temperature increases, which agrees well with the published experimental measurements. The temperature gradient is applied in the 2-D system showing that the formation of lateral branches can be prevented with the presence of the temperature gradient. The third case shows that the temperature significantly increases at the dendrite-electrolyte interface, and the dendrite deviates from the tree-type shape to a nearly rhombic shape. The simulation results provide valuable bases for the future comprehensive studies of the temperature dependent Li dendrite growth process.

AB Due to the compact structure in addition to the system safety level and environmental friendly characteristics, supercritical CO2 (S-CO2) cycle has emerged as a promising method to be used in engine waste heat recovery. This paper explores the potential of using a preheating S-CO2 cycle based system to recover the waste heat of a diesel engine. An original preheating system is presented, in which the high temperature engine exhaust gas is firstly utilized in the evaporator and then it is further cooled through preheating process together with the low temperature jacket cooling water. Though the entire heat load from these two heat sources could be entirely recovered, the high preheating temperature suppresses the heat transfer in the regenerator. An improved preheating S-CO2 cycle based system with a regeneration branch is then presented. S-CO2 flow from the compressor is divided into two parts, one of which is still preheated by the jacket cooling water and the cooled engine exhaust gas in series while the other is heated in a low temperature regenerator. The two flows converge and then continues to be heated in the high temperature regenerator and in the evaporator. The simulation results reveal that the improved system could achieve a deeper utilization of the regeneration heat load hence improve the system performance. The maximum net power output of the improved system reaches 68.4 kW, which is 7.4% higher than that of the original system, 63.7 kW. Adopting the improved preheating S-CO2 cycle based system for waste heat recovery, the engine power output (996 kW) can be increased by 6.9%.

AB Waste heat recovery from boiler exhaust flue-gas is an effective way to save energy in coal-fired power plants. The integration of a low-pressure economizer (LPE) is a conventional choice for waste heat recovery. In this study, thermodynamic analyses of a coal-fired power plant (CFPP) integrated with an LPE is conducted on a 600 MW CFPP as reference case. Standard coal consumption rate (SCCR) of the power plant could be decreased by 1.76 g.(kW h)(-1) by the LPE. Exergetic analysis reveals that significant irreversibility is exhibited by the air pre-heater (APH) of the waste heat recovery system with an LPE. Guided by the exergetic analysis of the conventional waste heat recovery system, a new conceptual system for waste heat recovery integrated with an S-CO2 cycle for CFPPs is designed in this study. In this novel system, the boiler flue-gas is split into two flows: one to heat air in APH, and another to drive an S-CO2 power cycle as the heat source. Parameters of the S-CO2 power cycle are thermodynamically optimized with the help of Genetic Algorithm. Optimal initial pressure and pressure ratio are 9.136 MPa and 5.84, respectively. Maximum cycle efficiency of the S-CO2 power cycle is 17.39%. With the optimal parameters, SCCR of the CFPP integrated with the S-CO2 power cycle decreases by 3.80 g.(kW h)(-1). If the LPE is further integrated, the reduction of SCCR can reach 5.19 g.(kW h)-1. The essential reason for the significant energy saving is revealed through exergetic analysis. Exergy losses and destructions also decrease significantly in the novel waste heat recovery system. Finally, the economic performance of the proposed system is evaluated. Results show that the novel waste heat recovery system is economically suitable, and that capital investment could be recycled in 3.067 years.

AB CO2 transcritical power cycle (CTPC) is attractive to engine waste heat recovery (WHR) due to its advantages of miniaturization and unique thermophysical properties of its working fluid. Since there is no, if any, literature considering dynamic characteristics of CTPC systems, in current work, a series of dynamic tests has been conducted on a kW-scale CTPC test bench for engine WHR. Effects of mass flow rate and pressure ratio on dynamic responses are mainly focused and compared among four CTPC systems, i.e. a basic CTPC (B-CTPC), a CTPC with a recuperator (R-CTPC), a CTPC with a preheater (P-CTPC) and a CTPC with both a recuperator and a preheater (PR-CTPC). Dynamic characteristics are quantified by time constant and settling time. Results show that the PR-CTPC system has the fastest dynamic responses among these four layouts and the P-CIPC system responds more quickly than the R-CIPC system thanks to the gas liquid heat exchange. Moreover, for the same layout, larger initial CO2 mass flow rate brings faster responses while initial system pressure ratio has little impacts on system dynamic responses. Also, dynamic characteristics of a basic CTPC system and a basic organic Rankine cycle (ORC) system are compared. The ORC system adopts R123 as its working fluid. Results indicate the basic CTPC system responds almost four times faster than the basic R123-ORC system.

AB The high-precision forecasting of wind speed is of great significance for the wind power exploitation. In this study, a new hybrid model is presented, which combines the EWT (Empirical Wavelet Transform) decomposition, the GWO (Grey Wolf Optimizer) algorithm, the RELM (Regularized Extreme Learning Machine) network and the IEWT (Inverse Empirical Wavelet Transform) reconstruction. In the proposed structure, to realize the high-precision wind speed prediction, the hybrid modeling strategy has been used as: the EWT is adopted to decompose the raw series into several wind speed subseries adaptively; the RELM network optimized by GWO is employed to forecast each subseries; At the end of the forecasting computation, the IEWT is utilized to reconstruct the forecasted results to avoid the unexpected forecasting values. To evaluate the performance of the proposed model, eleven models are implemented in four forecasting experimental cases. The experimental results of four metrics show that: (1) the IEWT is effective in improving the accuracy and stability of the prediction; (2) the GWO improves the forecasting performance of the proposed hybrid EWT-RELM-IEWT structure significantly; (3) the performance of the RELM network is better than that of the SVM (Support Vector Machine) in the proposed hybrid EWT-GWO-IEWT structure; (4) in the involved forecasting models, the proposed hybrid model has the best multiple step prediction performance.

AB In order to compensate for end losses in linear solar concentrators (which can account for 33% of the optical losses), a mechanically simple two-axis tracking system was designed and analyzed. In the proposed system, a standard linear Fresnel reflector (LFR) with east-west rotational tracking was placed on north-south rails and driven by a linear actuator. By keeping the receiver fixed, end losses can be eliminated when the reflector slides along the rails. The relative optical efficiency improvement of this design was studied in detail though a combination of theory, numerical simulation, and experimentation. The results show that the annual average optical efficiency of an LFR can be improved by 8-50%, depending on the normalized collector length and local latitude. The optimal sliding distance limit, D-s,D-lim and the LFR geometries where this design is most techno-economically beneficial were also investigated. It was found that the proposed tracking system is most applicable to solar driven, industrial process heat systems where rooftop or ground space is limited.

AB Citizens are actively interacting with their surroundings, especially through social media. Not only do shared posts give important information about what is happening (from the users' perspective), but also the metadata linked to these posts offer relevant data, such as the GPS-location in Location-based Social Networks (LBSNs). In this paper we introduce a global analysis of the geo-tagged posts in social media which supports (i) the detection of unexpected behavior in the city and (ii) the analysis of the posts to infer what is happening. The former is obtained by applying density-based clustering techniques, whereas the latter is consequence of applying content aggregation techniques. We have applied our methodology to a dataset obtained from Instagram activity in New York City for seven months obtaining promising results. The developed algorithms require very low resources, being able to analyze millions of data-points in commodity hardware in less than one hour without applying complex parallelization techniques. Furthermore, the solution can be easily adapted to other geo-tagged data sources without extra effort. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Since Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) won the image classification competition 202 (ILSVRC12), a lot of attention has been paid to deep layer CNN study. The success of CNN is attributed to its superior multi-scale high-level image representations as opposed to hand-engineering low-level features. However, estimating millions of parameters of a deep CNN requires a large number of annotated samples, which currently prevents many superior deep CNNs (such as AlexNet, VGG, ResNet) being applied to problems with limited training data. To address this problem, a novel two-phase method combining CNN transfer learning and web data augmentation is proposed. With our method, the useful feature presentation of pre-trained network can be efficiently transferred to target task, and the original dataset can be augmented with the most valuable Internet images for classification. Our method not only greatly reduces the requirement of a large training data, but also effectively expand the training dataset. Both of method features contribute to the considerable over-fitting reduction of deep CNNs on small dataset. In addition, we successfully apply Bayesian optimization to solve the tuff problem, hyper-parameter tuning, in network fine-tuning. Our solution is applied to six public small datasets. Extensive experiments show that, comparing to traditional methods, our solution can assist the popular deep CNNs to achieve better performance. Particularly, ResNet can outperform all the state-of-the-art models on six small datasets. The experiment results prove that the proposed solution will be the great tool for dealing with practice problems which are related to use deep CNNs on small dataset. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In the last years, many clustering techniques dealing with time course data have been proposed due to recent interests in studying phenomena that change over time. A new clustering method suitable for time series applications has been recently proposed by exploiting the properties of the P-splines approach. This semi-parametric tool has several advantages, i.e. it facilitates the removal of noise from time series and it ensures a computational time saving. In this paper, we propose to use this clustering approach on financial data with the aim of building a financial portfolio. Our proposal works directly on time series without any pre-processing, except for the computation of the spline coefficients and, eventually, normalizing the series. We show that our strategy is useful to support the investment decisions of financial practitioners. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Given a classification task, an approach to improve accuracy relies on the use of abstaining classifiers. These classifiers are trained to reject observations for which predicted values are not reliable enough: these rejected observations belong to an abstaining area in the feature space. Two equivalent methods exist to theoretically compute the optimal abstaining area for a given classification problem. The first one is based on the posterior probability computed by the model and the other is based on the derivative of the ROC function of the model. Although the second method has proved to give the best results, in small-sample settings such as the one found in omits data, the estimation of posterior probabilities and derivative of ROC curve are both lacking of precision leading to far from optimal abstaining areas. As a consequence none of the two methods bring the expected improvements in accuracy. We propose five alternative algorithms to compute the abstaining area adapted to small-sample problems. The idea of these algorithms is to compute an accurate and robust estimation of the ROC curve and its derivatives. These estimation are mainly based on the assumption that the distribution of the output of the classifier for each class is normal or mixture of normal distributions. These distributions are estimated by a kernel density estimator or Bayesian semiparametric estimator. Another method works on the approximation of the convex hull of the ROC curve. Once the derivative of the ROC curve are estimated, the optimal abstaining area can be directly computed. The performance of our algorithms are directly related to their capacity to compute an accurate estimation of the ROC curve. A sensitivity analysis of our methods to the dataset size and rejection cost has been done on a set of experiments. We show that our methods improve the performances of the abstaining classifiers on several real datasets and for different learning algorithms. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Over decades, medical image diagnosis has gained prominence, as it has saved millions of lives from dreadful diseases. Improvising image processing techniques in medical images has provoked substantial increment in the efficiency levels of patient diagnosis. Segregation and visualization of pathologies have been made available by several image processing algorithms, under which tumor recognition and tissue segmentation in Magnetic Resonance (MR) brain images are accomplished in this paper using a novel approach. The novel methodology suggested through this paper ensemble the functioning of two different techniques well known to the research community. The techniques are Bacteria Foraging Optimization (BFO) and Modified Fuzzy C - Means (MFCM) algorithms, where, BFO is familiar for its optimization abilities and MFCM, an advancement of Fuzzy C - Means algorithm initiates the clustering operation. Both these techniques are well employed into a single framework to perform MR brain image segmentation, so that effective tumor segregation and tissue segmentation can be achieved, concurrently. Frequent parameter tuning is not required in the case of the proposed combinational algorithm, which is entirely an automated approach, and development of such algorithm would facilitate the radiologists in patient diagnosing procedures, as they extricate both manual intervention and large time consumption. With the support rendered by an automated algorithm, large volumes of clinical datasets could be assessed with ease. The proposed algorithm is validated by the radiologists and also using the comparison parameters such as sensitivity, Specificity, Mean Squared Error (MSE), Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and computational time. By analysing the above said parameters it has been proved that the proposed algorithm is prodigious than the state-of-art segmentation algorithms. The sensitivity and the specificity values offered by the proposed methodology are 0.9048 and 0.9825, respectively. In addition to the clinical datasets, MR brain images from Harvard Brainweb database, Brainweb simulated database and BRATS-2013 challenge database are used to demonstrate the segmentation efficiency of the proposed algorithm. These factors are good enough to prove that the proposed combinational framework can be preferably opted for medical image analysis. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper learns the route choice behavior of passengers from Auto Fare Collection, timetable, and train loading data using a method combined with Bayesian inference and Metropolis-Hasting sampling. First, the influential factors of route choice such as in-vehicle travel time, transfer time, and in-vehicle crowding are given, Next, formulations are established based on AFC, timetable and train loading data, which are merged into a logit model of route choice behavior of subway passengers. Next, an algorithm integrating Bayesian inference and Metropolis-Hasting sampling is designed to calibrate parameters of the logit model. Finally, a case study of Beijing subway is applied to verify the validity of the model and algorithm. A detailed discussion shows that in-vehicle crowding plays a crucial role in passenger route choice behavior. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Texts in addition to maps and satellite images, have become an important spatial data resource in recent years. Electronic written texts used in mediated interactions, especially short messages, have triggered the emergence of new ways of writing. Extracting information from such short messages, which represent a rich source of information, is highly important in order to discover domain-relevant information in the text and facilitate information retrieval. However, short messages are hard to analyse because of their brief, unstructured and informal nature. This paper focuses on the kinds of special or unique spatial entities and relations are contained in short messages. A new entity extraction method specifically dedicated to French short messages (SMS and tweets) is outlined to address this issue. The method is then tested on more traditional sources, like newspaper texts. This work is crucial in order to take advantage of the vast amount of geographical knowledge expressed in heterogeneous unstructured data. Firstly, we propose a process in which new spatial entities are extracted (e.g. motpellier, montpelier, Montpel are associated with Montpellier). Secondly, we identify new spatial relations that precede spatial entities (e.g. sur, par). Finally, we propose general patterns for the extraction of spatial relations. The task is very challenging and complex due to the specificity of short message language, which is based on weakly standardized modes of writing. The experiments were carried out on the three French corpora (i.e. 88milSMS, tweets, and Midi Libre) and highlight the efficiency of our proposal for identifying new kinds of spatial entities and relations.

AB Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) supported by gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) was applied to detect and quantify residues of pyrimethanil on pome fruits, a widely used fungicide in horticultural species. Spheroidal AuNPs with different size were fabricated and compared in this study. The analytical procedure was set up on a silicon dioxide flat substrate to standardize SERS methodology. A Raman mapping strategy was exploited to increase signal reproducibility and to minimize bias due to different local surface morphologies. Univariate and multivariate regressions were compared for calibration. Multivariate PLS approach demonstrated acceptable repeatability and method stability (RMSECV= 4.79 ppm; RMSEP = 4.31 ppm) in the range 0-40 mg kg(-1), providing higher accuracy and intra-day repeatability with a mean percentage error of 18.7% and 32.8% for PLS and univariate calibration, respectively. The method here proposed can be reliably applied for PMT detection on pome fruits within the European law limits.

AB o-Benzoquinones, formed during oxidation of polyphenols, react with amines through a Michael addition. In the present study, the ability of 4-methylbenzoquinone (4MBQ) to trap N epsilon-(carboxymethyl) lysine (CML) through a Michael addition with the amine groups on CML was investigated at different pH values. Apparent second order rate constants (k(2)) for the reaction of 4MBQ with CML were determined by stopped-flow spectrophotometry at 25 degrees C to be similar to 0.0 M-1 s(-1) at pH 5, 9.5 M-1 s(-1) at pH 7, and 164.5 M-1 s(-1) at pH 8 based on the loss of 4MBQ at 401 nm. The reaction between 4MBQ and CML generated coloured CML-quinone compounds via colourless CML phenol species as identified by LC-ESI-MS/MS. These data provide evidence that CML formed during food production can be trapped by o-benzoquinones, which is a new mechanism by which polyphenols may be used to control CML levels in foods.

AB Biosynthesis of acetate esters by Lactobacillus plantarum 120, Staphylococcus xylosus 135 and Saccharomyces cerevisiae 31, isolated from Chinese traditional fermented fish (Suan yu) were studied. A buffer system containing acyl donors (acetic acid/glyceryl triacetate/acetyl-CoA) and aliphatic alcohols (C2-C6) was established, inoculated with intracellular and extracellular extracts of the three strains. The results showed that the biosynthesis pathway of L. plantarum 120 was esterification and alcoholysis, while the biosynthesis pathway of S. xylosus 135 and S. cerevisiae 31 was hydrolysis and esterification, rather than alcoholysis. The ester-synthesizing activity of L. plantarum 120 via alcoholysis was higher than that via esterification at high pH value, while an opposite result for each strain was observed at low pH value. Moreover, the ester-synthesis activity of L. plantarum 120 was higher than that of S. xylosus 135 and S. cerevisiae 31. In addition, microbial ester-synthesis activity increased with the increase of aliphatic alcohol carbon number.

AB beta-conglutin has been identified as a major allergen for Lupinus angustifolius seeds. The aim of this study was to evaluate the binding of IgE to five recombinant beta-conglutin isoforms (r beta) that we overexpressed and purified and to their natural counterparts in different lupin species and cultivars.
   Western blotting suggested beta-conglutins were the main proteins responsible for the IgE reactivity of the lupin species and cultivars. Newly identified polypeptides from "sweet lupin" may constitute a potential new source of primary or cross-reactive sensitization to lupin, particularly to L. albus and L. angustifolius seed proteins. Several of them exhibited qualitative and quantitative differences in IgE-binding among these species and cultivars, mainly in sera from atopic patients that react to lupin rather than peanut.
   IgE-binding was more consistent to recombinant beta 2 than to any of the other isoforms, making this protein a potential candidate for diagnosis and immunotherapy.

AB The edible oil processing industry involves large losses of organic solvent into the atmosphere and long extraction times. In this work, fast and environmentally friendly alternatives for the production of echium oil using green solvents are proposed. Advanced extraction techniques such as Pressurized Liquid Extraction (PLE), Microwave Assisted Extraction (MAE) and Ultrasound Assisted Extraction (UAE) were evaluated to efficiently extract omega-3 rich oil from Echium plantagineum seeds. Extractions were performed with ethyl acetate, ethanol, water and ethanol: water to develop a hexane-free processing method. Optimal PLE conditions with ethanol at 150 degrees C during 10 min produced a very similar oil yield (31.2%) to Soxhlet using hexane for 8 h (31.3%). UAE optimized method with ethanol at mild conditions (55 degrees C) produced a high oil yield (29.1%). Consequently, advanced extraction techniques showed good lipid yields and furthermore, the produced echium oil had the same omega-3 fatty acid composition than traditionally extracted oil.

AB The objective of this study was to develop functional nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) using beeswax (BW), propolis wax (PW) and pomegranate seed oil (PSO). NLCs were prepared by a melt emulsification-ultra sonication technique. The influences of solid lipid composition, surfactant blend concentration (2, 4, and 6% of formulation) and PSO content (10, 30 and 50% of total lipid phase) were investigated. Statistical evaluations revealed that the formulation variables had significant effects on physical properties of NLC. The developed nanocarriers presented particle sizes ranging from 71 to 366 nm, leading to excellent physical stability. The optimum formulations with minimum particle size and high zeta potential value were PW and BW+ glycerol behenate samples, containing 10% oil and 6% surfactant. DSC and XRD studies indicated that the addition of oil to the lipid phase could disturb the crystalline order and form lattice defects. TEM observations exhibited spherical morphology of the NLCs.

AB Effects of Lasiodiplodia theobromae inoculation on disease development, pericarp browning and membrane lipids metabolism of harvested "Fuyan" longan fruit were studied. Compared with control fruit, L. theobromae-inoculated longans showed higher fruit disease index, pericarp browning index and cell membrane permeability, as well as higher activities of phospholipase D, lipase and lipoxygenase. Additionally, there were lower contents of membrane phospholipids but higher content of phosphatidic acid, and lower level of unsaturated fatty acids but higher level of saturated ones with lower ratio of unsaturated fatty acid to saturated fatty acid and lower index of unsaturated fatty acids in pericarp of L. theobromae-inoculated longans. These results suggested that L. theobromae-induced disease development and pericarp browning of harvested longans might be attributed to the damaged cellular membrane structural integrity, induced by the activated membrane lipids-degrading enzymes increasing the degradation of membrane phospholipids and unsaturated fatty acids in pericarp of harvested longan fruit.

AB Tea polyphenols have been a topic of discussion due to their health benefits. Nevertheless, detailed studies on the antioxidant capacity and polyphenol contents of teas in relation to factors including geographical locations, plantation elevations and leaf grades have been limited. In this study, 53 tea samples were analysed to determine the individual and total catechin and theaflavin contents by HPLC and the total antioxidant capacity by Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC) methods. Results show that the polyphenol (catechins and theaflavins) contents were significantly influenced by plantation location. Black tea from low plantation elevation contained 22-28% more polyphenols than those from high elevation. Small tea leaves had up to 15% more polyphenols than larger leaves from similar elevation. The results were further confirmed by Principal Composition Analysis (PCA), which grouped the black and green tea samples into 3 different clusters, respectively.

AB The agronomic production systems may affect the levels of food metabolites. Metabolomics approaches have been applied as useful tool for the characterization of fruit metabolome. In this study, metabolomics techniques were used to assess the differences in phytochemical composition between goldenberry samples produced by organic and conventional systems. To verify that the organic samples were free of pesticides, individual pesticides were analyzed. Principal component analysis showed a clear separation of goldenberry samples from two different farming systems. Via targeted metabolomics assays, whereby carotenoids and ascorbic acid were analyzed, not statistical differences between both crops were found. Conversely, untargeted metabolomics allowed us to identify two withanolides and one fatty acyl glycoside as tentative metabolites to differentiate goldenberry fruits, recording organic fruits higher amounts of these compounds than conventional samples. Hence, untargeted metabolomics technology could be suitable to research differences on phytochemicals under different agricultural management practices and to authenticate organic products.

AB Effect of debranching for a high-amylose starch (similar to 70% amylose) on its V-complex formation with stearic acid was examined. Gel-permeation chromatograms showed that amylopectin was degraded to smaller molecules as the debranching time increased from 6 to 24 h. Increased formation of debranched starch/stearic acid complexes (recovery yield of stearic acid from 45.17 to 89.31% and starch from 39.92 to 55.43%) was observed with increased debranching time (from 6 to 24 h) and complexation time (from 6 to 24 h). The X-ray diffraction patterns of the debranched starch/stearic acid complexes displayed a mixture of B-type and V-type patterns, with 2. peaks at 7.6 degrees, 13.1 degrees, 17.2 degrees, 20 degrees, 21.6 degrees, and 23.4 degrees. The melting temperature and enthalpy changes of the debranched starch/stearic acid complexes were gradually enhanced with increasing debranching time. These results suggest that starch can be modified by debranching to produce a significant amount of debranched starch/stearic acid complexes.

AB Vine foliar applications of phenylalanine (Phe) or methyl jasmonate (MeJ) could improve the synthesis of secondary metabolites. However, there are no reports focusing on the effects of elicitation supported by precursor feeding on must amino acid composition in grapevines. The aim of this research was to study the effect of the elicitation of methyl jasmonate (MeJ) supported by phenylalanine (Phe) as a precursor feeding (MeJ + Phe) and its application individually on must amino acid composition. Results showed that foliar Phe and MeJ treatments decreased the concentration of most of the studied amino acids with respect to the control (p <= 0.05). MeJ + Phe treatment did not affect must nitrogen content. Musts obtained from MeJ + Phe showed higher concentration of several amino acids than samples from Phe and MeJ applications. Therefore, other sources of precursor feeding could support elicitation, to improve amino acid composition and be considered as a tool for viticulture.

AB Ginger-derived glycoproteins are a widely distributed group of biological macromolecules with multiple functions. To date, the structure of ginger-derived glycoproteins has not been clarified with regard to their complexity, their sequence diversity and their uneven micro-distribution. In this study, a lectin microarray was used to evaluate 37 types of lectins and determine the optimal lectins that can conjugate with glycoproteins based on the fluorescence intensity. Subsequently, the lectins were immobilized on magnetic beads, coupled with glycoproteins to enrich ginger-derived glycoproteins, and evaluated using SDS-PAGE. Our results showed that five lectins (e.g. VVA, ConA, STL, LEL, and LCA) were selected by the lectin microarray and that VVA showed the highest fluorescence intensity. In addition, it is indicated that the structure of the carbohydrate chains might contain GlaNAc, mannose, GlcNAc, and LacNAc.

AB A simple and green ionic liquid-based vortex-forced matrix solid phase dispersion (IL-VFMSPD) method was presented to simultaneously extract 5-hydroxymethyl furfurol (5-HMF) and iridoid glycosides in Fructus Corni by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography. Ionic liquid was used as a green elution reagent in vortex-forced MSPD process. A few parameters such as the type of ionic liquid, the type of sorbent, ratio of sample to sorbent, the concentration and volume of ionic liquid, grinding time and vortex time, were investigated in detail and an orthogonal design experiment was introduced to confirm the best conditions in this procedure. With the final optimized method, the recoveries of the target compounds in Fructus Corni were in the range of 95.2-103% (RSD < 5.0%) and the method displayed a good linearity within the range of 0.8-200 mu gmL(-1) for morroniside, sweroside, loganin, cornuside and 1.2-300 mu gmL(-1) for 5-HMF. The limits of detection ranged from 0.02 to 0.08 mu gmL(-1) for all compounds. The results showed that the newly established method was efficiently applied to extract and determine iridoid glycosides and 5-HMF for quality control of Fructus Corni.

AB Effects of HCl, H2SO4, HNO3, citric acid, and acetic acid on the yield, structure, and emulsifying properties of potato pectins were investigated. Results showed that the highest yield (14.34%) was obtained using citric acid, followed by HNO3 (9.83%), HCl (9.72%), H2SO4 (8.38%), and acetic acid (4.08%). The degrees of methylation (37.45%) and acetylation (15.38%), protein content (6.97%), and molecular weight (3.207x10(5) g/mol) were the highest for pectin extracted using acetic acid, and (galactose+arabinose)/rhamnose was 33.34, indicating that it had a highly branched rhamnogalacturonan I domain. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed a specific absorbance peak at 1064 cm(-1), which corresponds to the acetyl groups in potato pectins. SEM showed that all potato pectins are morphologically different. The emulsifying activity (EA, 44.97%-47.71%) and emulsion stability (ES, 36.54%-46.00%) of the pectins were influenced by acid types, and were higher than those of commercial citrus and apple pectin.

AB A real-time PCR assay was developed for detection of crab, a crustacean allergen, in food products. Group-specific primers and probes were developed to detect numerous species of crab. Method validation included tests of detection in complex food matrices, evaluation of commercial food products, and cross-reactivity testing on a wide variety of crustaceans. The method was able to detect several species of crab spiked into complex food matrices at levels ranging from 0.1 to 10(5) parts per million (weight/weight), worked equally well on different platforms, exhibited high specificity for crab over other types of crustaceans, and yielded much higher signals from commercial food products listing crab as an ingredient than from those containing other crustaceans.

AB Pectin oligosaccharide (POS) fractions were obtained by controlled chemical degradation of citrus peel pectin. By adjusting trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) concentration, three oligosaccharides were obtained, of molecular weight (Mw) range 3000-4000 Da, 2000-3000 Da and lower than 2000 Da. Varying hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) concentration and reaction time produced oligosaccharides of 3000-4000 Da and 2000-3000 Da. The relative proportions of acidic monosaccharide increased from 68.58% to 89.93% (TFA) and from 63.74% to 83.26% (H2O2) as the reaction conditions intensified. Prebiotic activity scores were used to quantify POS ability to promote selective growth of specific probiotics. Sample POSH1 from H2O2 degradation showed the highest prebiotic potential with prebiotic activity score 0.41 for Lactobacillus paracasei LPC-37 and 0.92 for Bifidobacterium bifidum ATCC 29521.

AB Excessive proteolysis during dry-cured ham processing may lead to high adhesiveness and consumer dissatisfaction. The aim of this research is to identify biomarkers for proteolysis and adhesiveness. Two hundred biceps femoris porcine muscle samples from Spanish dry-cured ham were firstly evaluated for various physicochemical parameters, including their proteolysis indices and instrumental adhesiveness. Proteins of samples with extreme proteolysis indices were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis and identified by tandem mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/TOF). We found that hams of higher proteolysis index had statistically significant increased adhesiveness. Proteomic analysis revealed statistically significant qualitative and quantitative differences between sample groups. Thus, protein fragments increased remarkably in samples with higher proteolysis index scores. In addition, higher proteolysis index hams showed increased degradation for a total of five non-redundant myofibrillar and sarcoplasmic proteins. However, myosin-1, alpha-actin and myosin-4 proteins were the biomarkers that underwent the most intense response to proteolysis and adhesiveness.

AB Taguchi design was used to examine the effect of parameters that should be optimized in order to control the alcoholic fermentation of the concentrated grape must (CGM) from cv. Xinomavro using the best-performing indigenous Hanseniaspora uvarum and Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains as multistarters. The "optimum" combination of conditions (cell ratio of H. uvarum/S. cerevisiae; inoculum size and inoculation time of S. cerevisiae; fermentation time and temperature) resulted in an alcoholic product that meets ethanol (79 g/kg) and residual sugar (164 g/kg) content requirements for further use in the production of balsamic type vinegar. Multistarter fermentation affected positively the varietal organoleptic traits of the fermented CGM. 5-(Hydroxymethyl)furfural content emerged as a critical factor for the standardization of this process. Scaling up experiments in 12 L barrels verified findings from small scale in 100 mL flasks. The results of this work can be used as a prototype in further similar efforts.

AB A new mass spectrometric method for evaluating metabolite formation of the pesticides thiacloprid, azoxystrobin, and difenoconazole was developed for the Brassica species pak choi and broccoli. Both, distribution and transformation kinetics of the active compounds and their metabolites were analyzed by UPLC-TWIMS-QTOF-MS. Additionally, HR-MS analysis and structure elucidation tools such as diagnostic ions, isotopic matches, and collision cross sections were applied for metabolites identification. Following the application of two plant protection products (containing the above-mentioned active compounds) in a greenhouse study plant material was cryo-milled and extracted with water/methanol. The residual levels of active compounds were identified at certain timepoints during pre-harvest intervals and in the final products. Different phase I and phase II metabolites of the pesticides were identified in different plant organs such as leaves, stems, (broccoli) heads, and roots. Three individual degradation pathways and distribution profiles are suggested including eight thiacloprid, eleven azoxystrobin and three difenoconazole metabolites.

AB It has been suggested that intensive breeding has led to decreased contents of health-promoting components in modern wheats. We therefore compared the contents and compositions of the major dietary fibre components, arabinoxylan and beta-glucan, in semolina and wholemeal flour of old and modern Italian durum wheats. No differences in total arabinoxylan content were observed but the modern varieties had higher proportions of soluble arabinoxylan in wholemeals and of beta-glucan in semolina. The study therefore provides no evidence that intensive breeding has had negative effects on the contents of dietary fibre components in durum wheat. However, comparison of material grown over two years indicated that the content and composition of arabinoxylan and beta-glucan were more stable in the older than in the modern genotypes. The identification of modern cultivars with high viscosity associated with a high content of beta-glucan suggests that they are good sources of fibre for human health.

AB The practice of adding adulterating substances in milk in order to raise profits is unfortunately worldwide. In addition, higher priced milk, coming from minor dairy species, is often illegally integrated with the lower priced cow milk. The presence of species-specific proteins, different from those declared in label, may be a serious problem for people with allergies. The development of proper analytical methods is therefore essential to protect consumer benefits and product authenticity.
   In this study, a proteomic approach for the detection of adulteration processes of specific milks in mixtures is proposed. Few microliters of milk samples have been digested with trypsin and chymotrypsin and analyzed by nanoLC-ESI-IT-MS/MS. A post-database processing was performed to obtain confident peptide sequence assignments, allowing the detection of milk adulteration at a level lower than 1%. Species-specific peptides from bovine beta-lactoglobulin and alpha S1 casein were identified as suitable peptide markers of milk authenticity.

AB The aim of present study was to examine whether the digestive system (saliva, simulated gastric and small intestinal conditions) could break down and large intestinal microbiota could utilize the polysaccharides from Fuzhuan brick tea (FBTPS). The results showed that there was no change in molecular weight, monosaccharide content and content of reducing sugars before and after saliva, simulated gastric and small intestinal digestion, indicating that FBTPS could pass through the digestive system without being broken down and reach the large intestine safely. The content of carbohydrate was significantly decreased by fermentation in vitro of gut microbiota, suggesting that FBTPS could be broken down and utilized by gut microbiota. FBTPS could significantly modulate the composition and abundance of gut microbiota. Furthermore, the contents of short-chain fatty acids were significantly increased. Therefore, FBTPS is expected to be a functional food to improve human health and prevent disease through promoting the gut health.

AB Nine novel dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitory peptides (FLQY, FQLGASPY, ILDKEGIDY, ILELA, LLQLEAIR, LPVP, LQALHQGQIV, MPVQA and SPVVPF) were identified in camel milk proteins hydrolysed with trypsin. This was achieved using a sequential approach combining liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), qualitative/quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) and confirmatory studies with synthetic peptides. The most potent camel milk protein-derived DPP-IV inhibitory peptides, LPVP and MPVQA, had DPP-IV half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of 87.0 +/- 3.2 and 93.3 +/- 8.0 mu M, respectively. DPP-IV inhibitory peptide sequences identified within camel and bovine milk protein hydrolysates generated under the same hydrolysis conditions differ. This was linked to differences in enzyme selectivity for peptide bond cleavage of camel and bovine milk proteins as well as dissimilarities in their amino acid sequences. Camel milk proteins contain novel DPP-IV inhibitory peptides which may play a role in the regulation of glycaemia in humans.

AB Evaluation of functional and bioactive compounds of Asparagus officinalis L. growing in conventional and organic greenhouse and conventional open - field farming was the aim of this research. Polyphenols in cladodes grown conventionally were higher than organic. Flavonoids and carotenoids were the highest in cladodes in open field. Organic spears were richer in total phenolics (+6.9% and +19.1%) and flavonoids (+4.7% and 16.8%) and showed higher in vitro averages of antioxidant activities by three radical scavenging assays (+12.5% and +22.2%) than conventional. Partial differentiation of organically and conventionally grown samples was proved by multivariate statistics. The binding properties of polyphenols to HSA were relatively high in comparison with other plants. A strong positive correlation of binding properties and bioactivity of asparagus was estimated. All new found aspects for the first time lead to recommendation of inclusion of all investigated asparagus plants into the human diet in a wider scale.

AB A specific, precise and accurate high performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) analytical method with a fluorescence detector (FLD) was established for the simultaneous determination of nine bisphenols (BPs) in milk samples. Samples were extracted ultrasonically with acetonitrile and cleaned using the QuEChERS technique. Under the optimized conditions, good linearity was obtained for the nine BPs and the correlation coefficients (R-2) ranged from 0.9942 to 0.9997. Recovery values for the nine bisphenols in spiked samples were 75.82-93.86% with intra-day and inter-day relative standard deviations (RSDs) from 2.6 to 11.1%. The limits of detection (LODs) and quantification (LOQs) were 1.0-3.1 mu g/kg and 3.5-9.8 mu g/kg, respectively. The results demonstrated clearly that the approach developed provides reliable, simple, rapid and environmentally-friendly quantification and identification of nine bisphenols in a fatty matrix and could be used for monitoring bisphenols in milk.

AB Heavy metal chromium (Cr) poses a severe health risk to humans via food chain contamination. In this study, the interactions of either trivalent chromium (Cr(III)) or hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) with catalase (CAT) were investigated via multi-spectroscopic studies and computational simulations. The fluorescence analysis showed that Cr(III) and Cr(VI) quenched the fluorescence of CAT through a dynamic and a static quenching mechanism, respectively. The binding constant of Cr(VI) with CAT was 3.44 x 10(4) l mol(-1) at 298 K. Other detailed binding characterizations of the Cr(VI)-CAT complex were also obtained using spectra analysis and molecular docking. Synchronous fluorescence, UV-vis and circular dichroism (CD) spectral studies showed that either Cr(III) or Cr (VI) induced conformational changes of CAT, but the degree of influence was different. The response of CAT activity to Cr(III) or Cr(VI) was found to be variable depending on their valence states and concentrations.

AB This study investigated the effect of reactive oxygen species-mediated oxidative stress on activation of mitochondrial apoptosis and tenderness of yak meat during postmortem ageing. Oxidative stress degree, Ca2+ levels, membrane permeability transition pore opening, mitochondrial membrane potential, apoptotic factors and the shear force were examined. Results showed that the ROS generated by H2O2 significantly increased mitochondrial oxidative stress by decreasing the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase, and increasing lipid peroxidation. Furthermore, oxidative stress enhanced Ca2+ production and cytochrome c release, changed the levels of Bcl-2 family proteins and activated caspase-9 and -3 activities. Ultimately, oxidative stress increased the apoptosis rate and tenderness of yak meat. These observations confirmed that ROS-mediated oxidative stress participates in the activation of the apoptotic cascade reaction involving Ca2+ and Bcl-2 family proteins. The results further suggested that ROS-mediated oxidative stress plays a significant role in meat tenderization through the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway.

AB Non-climacteric blueberry (Vaccinium spp.) fruits accumulate high levels of anthocyanins during ripening, which are a good source of dietary antioxidants. This study examined the effects of exogenous abscisic acid (ABA) application on fruit characteristics and anthocyanin accumulation in a northern highbush blueberry (V. corymbosum 'Jersey') during development. Fruits on shrubs were treated with 1 g L-1 ABA before the initiation of fruit colouration. Application of ABA temporarily increased the level of ABA in the fruits during development. Exogenous ABA had no obvious effect on fruit growth, but stimulated fruit colouration by accelerating the accumulation of individual anthocyanins, mainly malvidin, delphinidin and petunidin glycosides. This is the first report to show that ABA promotes the accumulation of anthocyanins in blueberry fruits. However, exogenous ABA also promoted fruit softening, which is undesirable during harvest and shelf life.

TI Acoustic impedance properties of seafloor sediments off the coast of

SO JOURNAL OF ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES

DT Article
DE Acoustic impedance; Index of impedance; Sound speed; Seafloor sediments
AB Geoacoustic parameters are essential inputs to sediment wave propagation theories and are vital to underwater acoustic environment and explorations of the sea bottom. In this study, 21 seafloor sediment samples were collected off the coast of southeastern Hainan in the South China Sea. The sound speed was measured using a portable WSD-3 digital sonic instrument and the coaxial differential distance measurement method. Based on the measured sound speed and physical properties, the acoustic impedance and the pore-water-independent index of impedance (IOI) were calculated in this study. Similar to the sound speed, the IOI values are closely related to the sediment physical properties and change gradually from the northwest to the southeast. The relations between IOI and physical properties were studied and compared to the relations between the sound speed and physical properties. IOI is better correlated to physical properties than sound speed. This study also uses an error norm method to analyze the sensitivity of IOI to the physical parameters in the double-parameter equations and finds that the most influential physical parameters are as follows: wet bulk density > porosity > clay content > mean particle size.

AB We have generated a more than 500 km long postseismic deformation rate map and cumulative displacement time series in the central Bayankala Block of the Tibetan Plateau using ENVISAT/ASAR data from 2003 to 2010 by the pi-RATE stacking algorithm. This rate map spans a period of similar to 7.2 years and reveals that postseismic motion of 2001 Kokoxili earthquake exhibits a striking signal, dominating crustal deformation of the central Bayankala Block with a cross -fault magnitude similar to 9-11 mm/yr in line of sight (LOS) (similar to 93.1 degrees E). The southern and northern parts of the postseismic deformation field exhibit different patterns and variable magnitudes, reflecting asymmetry of the displacement distribution. Postseismic motion affects eastward extrusion of the central Bayankala Block, which reaches similar to 15km north of the Ganzi-Yushu fault. To further investigate viscoelastic relaxation of the lower crust in this area after approximately two years, E-M, E-M-M and E-S models are constructed. The result shows that the best fit viscosity for the lower crust is about 1 x 10(19) Pa.s. Comparison between cumulative displacements resolved by these three models shows that viscoelastic relaxation of the lower crust makes the most significant contribution to postseismic stress relaxation after 2001 event.

AB The Oman Mountains comprise a series of thrust sheets of Neo-Tethyan oceanic rocks that were emplaced onto the Arabian continental margin during obduction of the Semail Ophiolite during the Late Cretaceous. Three separate groups of anomalous gypsiferous bodies intrude the allochthonous units along faults over a distance of about 150 km in the Hawasina Window, Jabal Qumayrah and Jabal Sumeini. The bodies at Jabal Sumeini form a band about 41cm long and up to 100 m wide along a late-stage thrust that restacks the allochthon over a post emplacement Maastrichtian-Palaeogene sedimentary succession. The gypsum shows evidence of flow-folding and contains numerous clasts and rafts of a range of quartzose sandstones, but with only a minor component from carbonates from the Neo-Tethyan Sumeini Group in the hanging-Wall. Palaeogene limestones from the footwall succession are essentially absent. Strontium isotope ratios are high and intersect with the open ocean water reference curve for the Late Cambrian-Ordovician and Late Miocene-Pliocene. They are also noticeably higher than the ratios from the two other gypsiferous outcrop areas in the Oman Mountains and from outcrops of Ediacaran-Early Cambrian salt domes in central Oman. However, the regional stratigraphy points towards a source of the gypsum from either an Ediacaran-Early Cambrian Ara Group salt basin or from the Lower Fars Formation (Early-Middle Miocene), and derivation of the sandstone clasts and rafts from thick Lower Palaeozoic elastic sequences. The discrepancy with the ages inferred from the strontium isotope data can be attributed to deposition of the gypsum in restricted conditions not in equilibrium with the prevailing ocean water. Two models are presented, for an Ediacaran-Early Cambrian and an Early-Middle Miocene source. While the latter cannot be wholly discounted, the stratigraphic and structural context point more strongly towards an Ediacaran-Early Cambrian Ara Group source of the gypsum. This was extruded along deep-rooted Late Cretaceous thrust faults that were reactivated during a period of Cenozoic compression, incorporating Lower Palaeozoic sandstone clasts from adjacent strata during extrusion, or during an earlier phase of possible halokinesis. This is consistent with existing models for the emplacement of the other two identified groups of gypsiferous bodies in the Oman Mountains and provides further evidence for the presence of smaller evaporite basins between the major Hormuz and central/southern Oman salt basins.

AB New zircon U-Pb ages, major- and trace-element data, and Hf isotopic compositions are presented for bimodal volcanic rocks of the Zhaga Formation (ZF) in the western middle segment of the Bangong-Nujiang suture zone (BNSZ), northern Tibet. The genesis of these rocks is described, and implications for late-stage evolution of the Bangong-Nujiang Tethyan Ocean (BNTO) are considered. Detailed studies show that the ZF bimodal rocks, which occur as layers within a typical bathyal to abyssal flysch deposit, comprise MORB-type basalt that formed at a mid-ocean ridge, and low-K calc-alkaline A-type rhyolite derived from juvenile crust. The combination of MORB-type basalt, calc-alkaline A-type rhyolite, and bathyal to abyssal flysch deposits in the ZF leads us to propose that they formed as a result of ridge subduction. The A-type ZF rhyolites yield LA-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb ages of 118-112 Ma, indicating formation during the Early Cretaceous. Data from the present study, combined with regional geological data, indicate that the BNTO underwent conversion from ocean opening to ocean closure during the Late Jurassic Early Cretaceous. The eastern segment of the BNTO closed during this period, while the western and western middle segments were still at least partially open and active during the Early Cretaceous, accompanied by ridge subduction within the Bangong-Nujiang Tethyan Ocean.

AB The Oman Mountains formed by late Cretaceous obduction of the Tethys-derived Semail Ophiolite. This study concerns the postobductional extension on the northern flank of the mountain belt. Nine sites at the northern margins of the Jabal Alchdar/Nakhl and Saih Hatat domes of the Eastern Oman ("Hajar") Mountains were investigated. The northern margins are marked by a system of major interconnected extensional faults, the "Frontal Range Fault". While the vertical displacements along the Saih Hatat and westerly located Jabal Nakhl domes measure 2.25-6.25 km, 0.5-4.5 km and 4-7 km, respectively, it amounts to 1-5 km along the Jabal Akhdar Dome. Extension had started during the late Cretaceous, towards the end of ophiolite emplacement. Two stages of extension can be ascertained (late Cretaceous to early Eocene and probably Oligocene) at the eastern part of the Frontal Range Fault System (Wadi Kabir and Fanja Graben faults of similar strike). Along the intervening and differently striking fault segments at Sad and Sunub the same two stages of deformation are deduced. The first stage is characterized again by extension. The second stage is marked by dextral motion, including local transtension. Probable Oligocene extension affected the Batinah Coast Fault while it also affected the Wadi Kabir Fault and the Fanja Graben. It is unclear whether the western portion of the Frontal Range Fault also went through two stages of deformation. Bedding-parallel ductile and brittle deformation is a common phenomenon. Hot springs and listwaenite are associated with dextral releasing bends within the fault system, as well as a basalt intrusion of probable Oligocene age. A structural transect through the Frontal Range along the superbly exposed Wadi Bani Kharous (Jabal Akhdar Dome) revealed that extension affected the Frontal Range at least 2.5 km south of the Frontal Range Fault. Also here, bedding-parallel shearing is important, but not exclusive. A late Cretaceous thrust was extensionally reactivated by a branch fault of the Frontal Range Fault. Extension may be ductile (limestone mylonites), ductile and brittle (ooid deformation, boudinaged belemnite rostra, shear bands) or brittle. Extension is heterogeneously distributed within the Frontal Range. Extension is mainly related to orogenic/gravitational collapse of the Oman Mountains. Collapse may have been associated with isostatic rebound and rise of the two domes. In the western part of the study area, the Frontal Range Fault has a listric morphology. It is probably horizontal at a depth of 15 km below the Batinah coastal area. The fault seems to use the clay- and tuff-bearing Aruma Group as shear horizon. The depth of 15 km may coincide with the brittle-ductile transition of quartz- and feldspar-rich rocks. Close to this depth, the listric Batinah Coast Fault curves into the Frontal Range Fault. Extension along the Frontal Range and Batinah Coast faults probably reactivated preexisting late Cretaceous thrust faults during post-late Eocene time. The latter fault is likely mechanically related to the Wadi Kabir Fault via the Fanja Graben Fault and the Sunub fault segment. Listwaenite and serpentinite cluster preferably around the extensional faults. The Semail Gap probably functioned as a sinistral transform fault or fault zone during the Permian.

AB Natural fractures have long been considered important factors in the production of gas from shale reservoirs because they can connect pore spaces and enlarge transport channels, thereby influencing the migration, accumulation and preservation of shale gas. Industrial-level shale gas production has been initiated in the lower Silurian Longmaxi Formation in northern Guizhou, South China. However, it is important to quantitatively predict the distribution of natural fractures in the lower Silurian shale reservoirs to locate additional 'sweet spots' in northern Guizhou. In this study, data obtained from outcrops, cores, thin sections, field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) images and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were used to determine the developmental characteristics and controlling factors of these fractures. Correlation analysis indicated that the mechanical parameters of the Longmaxi shale are mainly related to the total organic carbon (TOC), quartz, clay, calcite and dolomite contents. The spatial variations in the mechanical parameters of the Longmaxi shale were determined based on the spatial variations in the TOC and mineral contents. Then, a heterogeneous geo-mechanical model of the study area was established based on interpretations of the fault systems derived from seismic data and acoustic emission (AE) experiments performed on samples of the relevant rocks. The paleotectonic stress fields during the Yanshanian period were obtained using the finite element method (FEM). Finally, a fracture density calculation model was established to analyze the quantitative development of fractures, and the effects of faults and mechanical parameters on the development of fractures were determined. The results suggest that the main developmental period of tectonic fractures in the Longmaxi Formation was the Early Yanshanian period. During this time, the horizontal principal stress conditions were dominated by a SE NW-trending (135-315 degrees) compressional stress field, and the Longmaxi Formation experienced a maximum tectonic stress of 110-120 MPa. This simulated paleotectonic stress field was mainly controlled by faults and the contents of TOC, quartz, clay, calcite and dolomite; at different positions along the same fault, the degree of fracture development varies significantly. Overall, the distribution of fractures in the Longmaxi Formation can be used to optimize well deployment and provides a basis for the future exploration of shale gas.

AB In the modeling of wave propagation phenomena it is necessary to use time integration methods which are not only sufficiently accurate, but also properly describe the amplitude and phase of the propagating waves. It is not clear if amending the developed schemes by extrapolation methods to obtain a high order of accuracy preserves the qualitative properties of these schemes in the perspective of dissipation, dispersion and stability analysis. It is illustrated that the combination of various optimized schemes with Richardson extrapolation is not optimal for minimal dissipation and dispersion errors. Optimized third-order and fourth-order methods are obtained, and it is shown that the proposed methods combined with Richardson extrapolation result in fourth and fifth orders of accuracy correspondingly, while preserving optimality and stability. The numerical applications include the linear wave equation, a stiff system of reaction-diffusion equations and the nonlinear Euler equations with oscillatory initial conditions. It is demonstrated that the extrapolated third-order scheme outperforms the recently developed fourth-order diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta scheme in terms of accuracy and stability.

AB Sea level rise has already caused more frequent and severe coastal flooding and this trend will likely continue. Flood prediction is an essential part of a coastal city's capacity to adapt to and mitigate this growing problem. Complex coastal urban hydrological systems however, do not always lend themselves easily to physically-based flood prediction approaches. This paper presents a method for using a data-driven approach to estimate flood severity in an urban coastal setting using crowd-sourced data, a non-traditional but growing data source, along with environmental observation data. Two data-driven models, Poisson regression and Random Forest regression, are trained to predict the number of flood reports per storm event as a proxy for flood severity, given extensive environmental data (i.e., rainfall, tide, groundwater table level, and wind conditions) as input. The method is demonstrated using data from Norfolk, Virginia USA from September 2010 to October 2016. Quality-controlled, crowd-sourced street flooding reports ranging from 1 to 159 per storm event for 45 storm events are used to train and evaluate the models. Random Forest performed better than Poisson regression at predicting the number of flood reports and had a lower false negative rate. From the Random Forest model, total cumulative rainfall was by far the most dominant input variable in predicting flood severity, followed by low tide and lower low tide. These methods serve as a first step toward using data-driven methods for spatially and temporally detailed coastal urban flood prediction. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Digital Elevation Model (DEM) is one of the most important controlling factors determining the simulation accuracy of hydraulic models. However, the currently available global topographic data is confronted with limitations for application in 2-D hydraulic modeling, mainly due to the existence of vegetation bias, random errors and insufficient spatial resolution. A hydraulic correction method (HCM) for the SRTM DEM is proposed in this study to improve modeling accuracy. Firstly, we employ the global vegetation corrected DEM (i.e. Bare-Earth DEM), developed from the SRTM DEM to include both vegetation height and SRTM vegetation signal. Then, a newly released DEM, removing both vegetation bias and random errors (i.e. Multi-Error Removed DEM), is employed to overcome the limitation of height errors. Last, an approach to correct the Multi-Error Removed DEM is presented to account for the insufficiency of spatial resolution, ensuring flow connectivity of the river networks. The approach involves: (a) extracting river networks from the Multi-Error Removed DEM using an automated algorithm in ArcGIS; (b) correcting the location and layout of extracted streams with the aid of Google Earth platform and Remote Sensing imagery; and (c) removing the positive biases of the raised segment in the river networks based on bed slope to generate the hydraulically corrected DEM. The proposed HCM utilizes easily available data and tools to improve the flow connectivity of river networks without manual adjustment. To demonstrate the advantages of HCM, an extreme flood event in Huifa River Basin (China) is simulated on the original DEM, Bare-Earth DEM, Multi-Error removed DEM, and hydraulically corrected DEM using an integrated hydrologic-hydraulic model. A comparative analysis is subsequently performed to assess the simulation accuracy and performance of four different DEMs and favorable results have been obtained on the corrected DEM.

AB In recent years climate change and other anthropogenic factors have contributed to increased wildfire frequency and size in western United States forests. This research focuses on the evaluation of spatial and temporal changes in evapotranspiration (ET) following the 2011 Las Conchas Fire in New Mexico (USA) using the Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance Model (SSEBop ET). Evapotranspiration is coupled with soil burn severity and analyzed for 16 watersheds for water years 2001-2014. An average annual decrease of 120 mm of ET is observed within the regions affected by the Las Conchas Fire, and conifers were converted to grassland a year after the fire. On average, the post-fire annual ET in high, moderate, and low burn severity is lower than pre-fire ET by approximately 103-352 mm, 97-304 mm, and 91-268 mm, respectively. The ratio of post-fire evapotranspiration to precipitation (ET/P) is statistically different from pre-fire conditions (alpha = 0.05) in nine of the watersheds. The largest decrease in ET is approximately 13-57 mm per month and is most prominent during the summer (April to September). The observed decrease in ET contributes to our understanding of changes in water yield following wild-fires, which is of interest for accurately modeling and predicting hydrologic processes in semi-arid landscapes.

AB This study treats the catchment as a block box system with considering the rainfall input and runoff output being a stochastic process. The temporal rainfall-runoff relationship at the catchment scale is described by a convolution integral on a continuous time scale. Using the Fourier-Stieltjes representation approach, a frequency domain solution to the convolution integral is developed to the spectral analysis of runoff processes generated by temporal non-stationary rainfall events. It is shown that the characteristic time scale of rainfall process increases the runoff discharge variability, while the catchment mean travel time constant plays the role in reducing the variability of runoff discharge. Similar to the behavior of groundwater aquifers, catchments act as a low-pass filter in the frequency domain for the rainfall input signal. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB As two key threats to receiving water bodies, the generation mechanisms and processes of urban and agricultural nonpoint sources (NPSs) show clear differences, which lead to distinct characteristics of water quality responses with mixed land-uses catchments compared to single land-use ones. However, few studies have provided such insights in these characteristic or quantified different water environment responses to NPS pollution. In this study, an integrated modelling approach was developed for those complex catchments by combining three commonly used models: SWMM (Storm Water Management Model), SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) and MIKE 11. A case study was performed in a typical urban-rural catchment of Chao Lake, China. The simulated results indicated that urban NPS pollution responded sensitively to rainfall events and was greatly affected by the antecedent dry days. Compare to urban NPS, agricultural NPS pollution was characterized with the time-lag to rainfall depended on soil moisture and the post-rain-season emissions carried by lateral flows, and were also affected by the local farm-practice schedule. With comprehensive impacts from urban-rural land-uses, the time-interleaved urban and agricultural NPS pollution emissions and more abundant pollution accumulation both led to a decrease in the responsive time and an increase in the frequency of peak pollution concentration values even during the dry season. These obtained characteristics can provide guidance for drafting watershed management plans in similar mixed land use catchments. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved:

AB The copula functions have been widely applied as an advance technique to create joint probability distribution of drought duration and severity. The approach of data collection as well as the amount of data and dispersion of data series can last a significant impact on creating such joint probability distribution using copulas. Usually, such traditional analyses have shed an Unconnected Drought Runs (UDR) approach towards droughts. In other word, droughts with different durations would be independent of each other. Emphasis on such data collection method causes the omission of actual potentials of short-term extreme droughts located within a long-term UDR. Meanwhile, traditional method is often faced with significant gap in drought data series. However, a long-term UDR can be approached as a combination of short-term Connected Drought Runs (CDR). Therefore this study aims to evaluate systematically two UDR and CDR procedures in joint probability of drought duration and severity investigations. For this purpose, rainfall data (1971-2013) from 24 rain gauges in Lake Urmia basin, Iran were applied. Also, seven common univariate marginal distributions and seven types of bivariate copulas were examined. Compared to traditional approach, the results demonstrated a significant comparative advantage of the new approach. Such comparative advantages led to determine the correct copula function, more accurate estimation of copula parameter, more realistic estimation of joint/conditional probabilities of drought duration and severity and significant reduction in uncertainty for modeling.

AB In sparsely fractured rock, the ubiquitous heterogeneity of the matrix, which has been observed in different laboratory and in situ experiments, has been shown to have a significant influence on retardation mechanisms that are of importance for the safety of deep geological repositories for nuclear waste. Here, we propose a conceptualisation of a typical heterogeneous granitic rock matrix based on micro Discrete Fracture Networks (micro-DFN). Different sets of fractures are used to represent grain boundary pores as well as micro fractures that transect different mineral grains. The micro-DFN model offers a great flexibility in the way inter- and intra-granular space is represented as the different parameters that characterise each fracture set can be fine tuned to represent samples of different characteristics. Here, the parameters of the model have been calibrated against experimental observations from granitic rock samples taken at Forsmark (Sweden) and different variant cases have been used to illustrate how the model can be tied to rock samples with different attributes. Numerical through-diffusion simulations have been carried out to infer the bulk properties of the model as well as to compare the computed mass flux with the experimental data from an analogous laboratory experiment. The general good agreement between the model results and the experimental observations shows that the model presented here is a reliable tool for the understanding of retardation mechanisms occurring at the mm-scale in the matrix.

AB Changes in the extent and amount of snow cover in Eurasia are of great interest because of their vital impacts on the global climate system and regional water resource management. This study investigated the spatial and temporal variability of the snow cover extent (SCE) and snow water equivalent (SWE) of the continental Eurasia using the Northern Hemisphere Equal-Area Scalable Earth Grid (EASE-Grid) Weekly SCE data for 1972-2006 and the Global Monthly EASE-Grid SWE data for 1979-2004. The results indicated that, in general, the spatial extent of snow cover significantly decreased during spring and summer, but varied little during autumn and winter over Eurasia in the study period. The date at which snow cover began to disappear in spring has significantly advanced, whereas the timing of snow cover onset in autumn did not vary significantly during 1972-2006. The snow cover persistence period declined significantly in the western Tibetan Plateau as well as partial area of Central Asia and northwestern Russia, but varied little in other parts of Eurasia. "Snow-free breaks" (SFBs) with intermittent snow cover in the cold season were principally observed in the Tibetan Plateau and Central Asia, causing a low sensitivity of snow cover persistence period to the timings of snow cover onset and disappearance over the areas with shallow snow. The averaged SFBs were 1-14 weeks during the study period and the maximum intermittence could even reach 25 weeks in certain years. At a seasonal scale, SWE usually peaked in February or March, but fell gradually since April across Eurasia. Both annual mean and annual maximum SWE decreased significantly during 1979-2004 in most parts of Eurasia except for eastern Siberia as well as northwestern and northeastern China. The possible cross-platform inconsistencies between two passive microwave radiometers may cause uncertainties in the detected trends of SWE here, suggesting an urgent need of producing a long-term, more homogeneous SWE product in future.

AB The response of stream chemistry to storm is of major interest for understanding the export of dissolved and particulate species from catchments. The related challenge is the identification of active hydrological flow paths during these events and of the sources of chemical elements for which these events are hot moments of exports. An original four-year data set that combines high frequency records of stream flow, turbidity, nitrate and dissolved organic carbon concentrations, and piezometric levels was used to characterize storm responses in a headwater agricultural catchment. The data set was used to test to which extend the shallow groundwater was impacting the variability of storm responses. A total of 177 events were described using a set of quantitative and functional descriptors related to precipitation, stream and groundwater pre-event status and event dynamics, and to the relative dynamics between water quality parameters and flow via hysteresis indices. This approach led to identify different types of response for each water quality parameter which occurrence can be quantified and related to the seasonal functioning of the catchment. This study demonstrates that high-frequency records of water quality are precious tools to study/unique in their ability to emphasize the variability of catchment storm responses.

AB Rain gauge observations are commonly used to evaluate the quality of satellite precipitation products. However, the inherent difference between point-scale gauge measurements and areal satellite precipitation, i.e. a point of space in time accumulation v.s. a snapshot of time in space aggregation, has an important effect on the accuracy and precision of qualitative and quantitative evaluation results. This study aims to quantify the uncertainty caused by various combinations of spatiotemporal scales (0.1 degrees-0.8 degrees and 1-24 h) of gauge network designs in the densely gauged and relatively flat Ganjiang River basin, South China, in order to evaluate the state-of-the-art satellite precipitation, the Integrated Multi satellite Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG). For comparison with the dense gauge network serving as "ground truth", 500 sparse gauge networks are generated through random combinations of gauge numbers at each set of spatiotemporal scales. Results show that all sparse gauge networks persistently underestimate the performance of IMERG according to most metrics. However, the probability of detection is overestimated because hit and miss events are more likely fewer than the reference numbers derived from dense gauge networks. A nonlinear error function of spatiotemporal scales and the number of gauges in each grid pixel is developed to estimate the errors of using gauges to evaluate satellite precipitation. Coefficients of determination of the fitting are above 0.9 for most metrics. The error function can also be used to estimate the required minimum number of gauges in each grid pixel to meet a predefined error level. This study suggests that the actual quality of satellite precipitation products could be better than conventionally evaluated or expected, and hopefully enables non-subject-matter expert researchers to have better understanding of the explicit uncertainties when using point-scale gauge observations to evaluate areal products.

AB This paper advances the physical understanding of the flow duration curve (FDC) regional variation. It provides a process-based analysis of the interaction between climate and landscape properties to explain disparities in FDC shapes. We used (i) long term measured flow and precipitation data over 73 catchments from the eastern US. (ii) We calibrated the Sacramento model (SAC-SMA) to simulate soil moisture and flow components FDCs. The catchments classification based on storm characteristics pointed to the effect of catchments landscape properties on the precipitation variability and consequently on the FDC shapes. The landscape properties effect was pronounce such that low value of the slope of FDC (SFDC) hinting at limited flow variability-were present in regions of high precipitation variability. Whereas, in regions with low precipitation variability the SFDCs were of larger values. The topographic index distribution, at the catchment scale, indicated that saturation excess overland flow mitigated the flow variability under conditions of low elevations with large soil moisture storage capacity and high infiltration rates. The SFDCs increased due to the predominant subsurface stormflow in catchments at high elevations with limited soil moisture storage capacity and low infiltration rates. Our analyses also highlighted the major role of soil infiltration rates on the FDC despite the impact of the predominant runoff generation mechanism and catchment elevation. In conditions of slow infiltration rates in soils of large moisture storage capacity (at low elevations) and predominant saturation excess, the SFDCs were of larger values. On the other hand, the SFDCs decreased in catchments of prevalent subsurface stormflow and poorly drained soils of small soil moisture storage capacity. The analysis of the flow components FDCs demonstrated that the interflow contribution to the response was the higher in catchments with large value of slope of the FDC. The surface flow FDC was the most affected by the precipitation as it tracked the precipitation duration curve (PDC). In catchments with low SFDCs, this became less applicable as surface flow FDC diverged from PDC at the upper tail (> 40% of the flow percentile). The interflow and baseflow FDCs illustrated most the filtering effect on the precipitation. The process understanding we achieved in this study is key for flow simulation and assessment in addition to future works focusing on process-based FDC predictions. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Probabilistic modelling of drought events is a significant aspect of water resources management and planning. In this study, popularly applied and several relatively new bivariate Archimedean copulas were employed to derive regional and spatial based copula models to appraise drought risk in mainland China over 1961-2013. Drought duration (Dd), severity (Ds), and peak (Dp), as indicated by Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), were extracted according to the run theory and fitted with suitable marginal distributions. The maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and curve fitting method (CFM) were used to estimate the copula parameters of nineteen bivariate Archimedean copulas. Drought probabilities and return periods were analysed based on appropriate bivariate copula in sub-region I-VII and entire mainland China. The goodness-of-fit tests as indicated by the CFM showed that copula NN19 in sub-regions III, IV, V, VI and mainland China, NN20 in sub-region I and NN13 in sub-region VII are the best for modeling drought variables. Bivariate drought probability across mainland China is relatively high, and the highest drought probabilities are found mainly in the Northwestern and Southwestern China. Besides, the result also showed that different sub-regions might suffer varying drought risks. The drought risks as observed in Sub-region III, VI and VII, are significantly greater than other sub-regions. Higher probability of droughts of longer durations in the sub-regions also corresponds to shorter return periods with greater drought severity. These results may imply tremendous challenges for the water resources management in different sub-regions, particularly the Northwestern and Southwestern China. 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Previous studies have shown that geostatistics-based transient hydraulic tomography (THT) is robust for subsurface heterogeneity characterization through the joint inverse modeling of multiple pumping tests. However, the hydraulic conductivity (K) and specific storage (S-s) estimates can be smooth or even erroneous for areas where pumping/observation densities are low. This renders the imaging of interlayer and intralayer heterogeneity of highly contrasting materials including their unit boundaries difficult. In this study, we further test the performance of THT by utilizing existing and newly collected pumping test data of longer durations that showed drawdown responses in both aquifer and aquitard units at a field site underlain by a highly heterogeneous glaciofluvial deposit. The robust performance of the THT is highlighted through the comparison of different degrees of model parameterization including: (1) the effective parameter approach; (2) the geological zonation approach relying on borehole logs; and (3) the geostatistical inversion approach considering different prior information (with/without geological data). Results reveal that the simultaneous analysis of eight pumping tests with the geostatistical inverse model yields the best results in terms of model calibration and validation. We also find that the joint interpretation of long-term drawdown data from aquifer and aquitard units is necessary in mapping their full heterogeneous patterns including intralayer variabilities. Moreover, as geological data are included as prior information in the geostatistics-based THT analysis, the estimated K values increasingly reflect the vertical distribution patterns of permeameter-estimated K in both aquifer and aquitard units. Finally, the comparison of various THT approaches reveals that differences in the estimated K and S-s tomograms result in significantly different transient drawdown predictions at observation ports.

AB For three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations in inland waters, the rapid changes with moving boundary and various input conditions should be considered. Some models are developed with moving boundary but the dynamic change of discharges is unresolved or ignored. For better hydrodynamic simulation in inland waters, the widely used 3D model, ECOMSED, has been improved by moving confluence route (MCR) method with a wetting and drying scheme (WAD). The fixed locations of water and pollutants inputs from tributaries, point sources and non-point sources have been changed to dynamic confluence routes as the boundary moving. The improved model was applied in an inland water area, Qingshuihai reservoir, Kunming City, China, for a one-year hydrodynamic simulation. The results were verified by water level, flow velocity and water mass conservation. Detailed water level variation analysis and velocity field comparison at different times showed that the improved model has better performance for simulating the boundary moving phenomenon and moving discharges along with water level changing than the original one. The improved three-dimensional model is available for hydrodynamics simulation in water bodies where water boundary shifts along with change of water level and have various inlets.

AB Retention Soil Filters (RSFs), a form of vertical flow constructed wetlands specifically designed for combined sewer overflow (CSO) treatment, have proven to be an effective tool to mitigate negative impacts of CSOs on receiving water bodies. Long-term hydrologic simulations are used to predict the emissions from urban drainage systems during planning of stormwater management measures. So far no universally accepted model for RSF simulation exists. When simulating hydraulics and water quality in RSFs, an appropriate level of detail must be chosen for reasonable balancing between model complexity and model handling, considering the model input's level of uncertainty.
   The most crucial parameters determining the resultant uncertainties of the integrated sewer system and filter bed model were identified by evaluating a virtual drainage system with a Retention Soil Filter for CSO treatment. To determine reasonable parameter ranges for RSF simulations, data of 207 events from six full-scale RSF plants in Germany were analyzed.
   Data evaluation shows that even though different plants with varying loading and operation modes were examined, a simple model is sufficient to assess relevant suspended solids (SS), chemical oxygen demand (COD) and NH4 emissions from RSFs. Two conceptual RSF models with different degrees of complexity were assessed. These models were developed based on evaluation of data from full scale RSF plants and column experiments. Incorporated model processes are ammonium adsorption in the filter layer and degradation during subsequent dry weather period, filtration of SS and particulate COD (X-COD) to a constant background concentration and removal of solute COD (S-COD) by a constant removal rate during filter passage as well as sedimentation of SS and X-COD in the filter overflow.
   X-COD, SS and ammonium loads as well as ammonium concentration peaks are discharged primarily via RSF overflow not passing through the filter bed. Uncertainties of the integrated simulation of the sewer system and RSF model mainly originate from the model parameters of the hydrologic sewer system model. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB In the present study, three types of artificial intelligence techniques, least square support vector machine (LSSVM), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) and M5 model tree (M5T) are applied for modeling daily dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration using several water quality variables as inputs. The DO concentration and water quality variables data from three stations operated by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) were used for developing the three models. The water quality data selected consisted of daily measured of water temperature (TE, degrees C), pH (std. unit), specific conductance (SC, mu S/cm) and discharge (DI cfs), are used as inputs to the LSSVM, MARS and M5T models. The three models were applied for each station separately and compared to each other. According to the results obtained, it was found that: (i) the DO concentration could be successfully estimated using the three models and (ii) the best model among all others differs from one station to another.

AB Groundwater-fed agriculture has caused water table declines and groundwater quality degradation in the North China Plain. Based on sediment sampling in deep vadose zone (with a maximum depth of 11.0 m), groundwater recharge, seepage velocity, solute inventory and transport under four typical irrigated agricultural land-use types (winter wheat and summer maize, WM; pear orchards, PO; outdoor vegetables, VE; and cotton, CO) were investigated in this study. The results reveal that there are many solutes stored in the vadose zone. Nitrate storage per unit depth in the vadose zone is highest under PO (1703 kg/ha), followed by VE (970 kg/ha), WM (736 kg/ha) and CO (727 kg/ha). However, the amount of annual leached nitrate under the four land-use types results in a different order (VE, 404 kg/ha; WM, 108 kg/ha; PO, 23 kg/ha; CO, 13 kg/ha). The estimated average recharge rates are 180 mm/yr for WM, 27 mm/yr for CO, 320 mm/yr for VE and 49 mm/yr for PO. The seepage velocity under VE (2.22 m/yr) exceeds the values under the other three land-use types (WM, 0.85 m/yr; PO, 0.49 m/yr; CO, 0.09 m/yr). The highest seepage velocity under VE caused significant nitrate contamination in groundwater, whereas the other two land-use types (WM and PO) had no direct influence on groundwater quality. The results of this work could be used for groundwater resources management. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The canopy storage capacity (S) is a major component of the surface water balance. We analysed the relationship between the tree canopy water storage capacity and leaf wettability under changing simulated rainfall temperature. We estimated the effect of the rain temperature change on the canopy storage capacity and contact angle of leave and needle surfaces based on two scenarios. Six dominant forest trees were analysed: English oak (Quercus roburL), common beech (Papas sylvatica L), small-leaved lime (Tilia cordata Mill), silver fir (Abies alba), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.),and Norway spruce (Picea abies L). Twigs of these species were collected from Krynica Zdroj, that is, the Experimental Forestry unit of the University of Agriculture in Cracow (southern Poland). Experimental analyses (simulations of precipitation) were performed in a laboratory under controlled conditions. The canopy storage capacity and leaf wettability classification were determined at 12 water temperatures and a practical calculator to compute changes of S and contact angles of droplets was developed. Among all species, an increase of the rainfall temperature by 0.7 degrees C decreases the contact angle between leave and needle surfaces by 2.41 degrees and increases the canopy storage capacity by 0.74 g g(-1); an increase of the rain temperature by 2.7 degrees C decreases the contact angle by 9.29 degrees and increases the canopy storage capacity by 2.85 g g(-1). A decreased contact angle between a water droplet and leaf surface indicates increased wettability. Thus, our results show that an increased temperature increases the leaf wettability in all examined species. The comparison of different species implies that the water temperature has the strongest effect on spruce and the weakest effect on oak. These data indicate that the rainfall temperature influences the canopy storage capacity. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We investigated the interactions of Lake Merzbacher with the Southern Inylchek Glacier (Central Tien Shan) using the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Pixel Offset-Small Baseline Subset (PO-SBAS) to derive a time series of three-dimensional (3D) glacier motion. The measurements of 3D glacier velocity were similar to 17% more precise than a previous study that did not use the SBAS estimation. The velocities of the glacier were up to 58 cm/day east, 70 cm/day north, and 113 cm/day vertically. Combining these data with Landsat images indicated that movement of the glacier is sensitive to changes of Lake Merzbacher. Specifically, the entry of more lake water into the glacier during the ablation season increased englacial ablation due to thermal erosion. Moreover, ice calving begins when the lake water gradually lifts the ice dam. Calving can cause greater loss of glacier mass than normal ablation. Trying to replenish the front mass loss, the distributary accelerates and the mass loss further intensifies. A time series of the vertical velocity indicates that the glacier tongue has a huge englacial cavity. We suggest that the lake outburst is directly related to the crack of this cavity. Bursting of the lake triggers a mini-surge at the glacier tongue. The vertical velocity at the ice dam was similar to+60 cm/day before the lake outburst, and similar to-113 cm/day afterwards. After drainage of the lake, flow velocities at the distributary, do not sharply decrease because pre-drainage mass loss needs to be replenished by fast flow. Based on comparisons with previous measurements, our results indicate that the lake had an increasing influence on the glacier from 2005 to 2009. This study demonstrates that a time series of 3D glacier motion based on the PO-SBAS technique is effective for assessing the dynamics of a mountain glacial system and interactions with its glacial lake.

AB Pre-excavation dewatering (PED) is an important construction stage in deep excavation. Field measurements show that retaining walls can develop obvious deflections during PED, which has been rarely considered in the past. The characteristics of PED-induced wall deflection, and the relationship of this deflection to surrounding ground deformation are still unclear. In this study, a PED test is simulated by a numerical model. The model is verified by field observations and used to investigate the responses of retaining wall and surrounding ground to PED. Results indicate that the maximum wall defection (delta(hm)) and surface settlement (delta(vm)) can all reach centimeter level under common conditions of PED. The ratio of delta(vm) to delta(hm) varies at the range of 0.45-0.67. Wall and soil deformations will be more obvious if the soils within the dewatering depth (H-d) have better permeability. The relative positions between H-d and strata (i.e., aquifer or aquitard) have great influence on the PED-induced deformations. If an aquifer appears below H-d, further increasing H-d can induce a rapid growth of wall and soil deformations. If thick aquitard appears below H-d, the deformation increments by further increasing H-d are not apparent. However, once H-d exceeds the center of the thick aquitard and reaches a thick confined aquifer, the wall deflections and soil deformation zones behind the wall will enlarge significantly. Meanwhile, a large bending moment in the retaining wall will arise around the bottom of the confined aquifer. The designers should consider this condition and allocate enough steel rebars there, preventing the appearance of wall cracks in the confined aquifer. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Identifying nonpoint sources of nitrate has been a long-term challenge in mixed land-use watershed. In the present study, we combine dual nitrate isotope, runoff and stream water monitoring to elucidate the nonpoint nitrate sources across land use, and determine the relative importance of biogeochemical processes for nitrate export in a small suburban watershed, Longhongjian watershed, China. Our study suggested that NH4+ fertilizer, soil NH4+, litter fall and groundwater were the main nitrate sources in Longhongjian Stream. There were large changes in nitrate sources in response to season and land use. Runoff analysis illustrated that the tea plantation and forest areas contributed to a dominated proportion of the TN export. Spatial analysis illustrated that NO3- concentration was high in the tea plantation and forest areas, and delta N-15-NO3 and delta O-18-NO3 were enriched in the step ponds. Temporal analysis showed high NO3- level in spring, and nitrate isotopes were enriched in summer. Study as well showed that the step ponds played an important role in mitigating nitrate pollution. Nitrification and plant uptake were the significant biogeochemical processes contributing to the nitrogen transformation, and denitrification hardly occurred in the stream.

AB As the relationship between vegetation and soil moisture is complex and reciprocal, there is a need to understand how spatial patterns in soil moisture influence the distribution of vegetation, and how the structure of vegetation canopies and root networks regulates the partitioning of precipitation. Spatial patterns of soil moisture are often difficult to visualise as usually, soil moisture is measured at point scales, and often difficult to extrapolate. Here, we address the difficulties in collecting large amounts of spatial soil moisture data through a study combining plot- and transect-scale electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) surveys to estimate soil moisture in a 3.2 km(2) upland catchment in the Scottish Highlands. The aim was to assess the spatio-temporal variability in soil moisture under Scots pine forest (Pinus sylvestris) and heather moorland shrubs (Calluna vulgaris); the two dominant vegetation types in the Scottish Highlands. The study focussed on one year of fortnightly ERT surveys. The surveyed resistivity data was inverted and Archie's law was used to calculate volumetric soil moisture by estimating parameters and comparing against field measured data. Results showed that spatial soil moisture patterns were more heterogeneous in the forest site, as were patterns of wetting and drying, which can be linked to vegetation distribution and canopy structure. The heather site showed a less heterogeneous response to wetting and drying, reflecting the more uniform vegetation cover of the shrubs. Comparing soil moisture temporal variability during growing and non-growing seasons revealed further contrasts: under the heather there was little change in soil moisture during the growing season. Greatest changes in the forest were in areas where the trees were concentrated reflecting water uptake and canopy partitioning. Such differences have implications for climate and land use changes; increased forest cover can lead to greater spatial variability, greater growing season temporal variability, and reduced levels of soil moisture, whilst projected decreasing summer precipitation may alter the feedbacks between soil moisture and vegetation water use and increase growing season soil moisture deficits.

AB The aim of this study is to examine the contribution of North Atlantic tropical cyclones (TCs) to flooding and heavy rainfall across the continental United States. Analyses highlight the spatial variability in these hazards, their temporal changes in terms of frequency and magnitude, and their connection to large-scale climate, in particular to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). We use long-term stream and rain gage measurements, and our analyses are based on annual maxima (AMs) and peaks-over-threshold (POTs). TCs contribute to similar to 20-30% of AMs and POTs over Florida and coastal areas of the eastern United States, and the contribution decreases as we move inland. We do not detect statistically significant trends in the magnitude or frequency of TC floods. Regarding the role of climate, NAO and ENSO do not play a large role in controlling the frequency and magnitude of TC flooding. The connection between heavy rainfall and TCs is comparable to what observed in terms of flooding. Unlike flooding, NAO plays a significant role in TC-related extreme rainfall along the U.S. East Coast, while ENSO is most strongly linked to the TC precipitation in Texas. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This study focused on estimating the fate of chlorine around an infiltration well and improving the knowledge about processes that control the physical extent of the disinfected/affected radius. Closed bottle batch tests revealed low chlorine consumption rates for filter gravel and sand (0.005 mg/g/d) and higher rates for clay (0.030 mg/g/d) as well as natural aquifer material (0.054 mg/g/d). Smaller grain sizes <1 mm showed 10- to 70-times higher initial chlorine consumption rates within the first hour after contact compared to the median consumption rates. Initial chlorine concentration most likely does not impact disinfection ability at grain sizes >1 mm, but results in more effective disinfection for very fine material <0.063 mm. Column studies focused on the adaptation of the lab results to an actual SIR waterworks in Khabarovsk, Russia. Results reinforced the previous lab results with low 1st-order decay constants of 16 d(-1) for filter material and much higher values of 254 d(-1) for natural aquifer material. Application of the chlorine consumption rates to an example well consistently indicated that the filter gravel pack consumes <1% of infiltrated chlorine. The disinfection zone at the example well seems to extend to maximum 3.5 m into the aquifer. Excessive chlorine dosage of >10 mg/l would not further extend the disinfected radius. A preferable way to increase the range of chlorine application is to increase the total infiltrated volume and time. Three approaches are proposed for adapting lab results to actual infiltration wells, that are in principle applicable to any other site. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Most soil water balance models only consider downward soil water movement driven by gravitational potential, and thus cannot simulate upward soil water movement driven by evapotranspiration especially in agricultural areas. In addition, the models cannot be used for simulating soil water movement in heterogeneous soils, and usually require many empirical parameters. To resolve these problems, this study derives a new one-dimensional water balance model for simulating both downward and upward soil water movement in heterogeneous unsaturated zones. The new model is based on a hybrid of numerical and statistical methods, and only requires four physical parameters. The model uses three governing equations to consider three terms that impact soil water movement, including the advective term driven by gravitational potential, the source/sink term driven by external forces (e.g., evapotranspiration), and the diffusive term driven by matric potential. The three governing equations are solved separately by using the hybrid numerical and statistical methods (e.g., linear regression method) that consider soil heterogeneity. The four soil hydraulic parameters required by the new models are as follows: saturated hydraulic conductivity, saturated water content, field capacity, and residual water content. The strength and weakness of the new model are evaluated by using two published studies, three hypothetical examples and a real-world application. The evaluation is performed by comparing the simulation results of the new model with corresponding results presented in the published studies, obtained using HYDRUS-1D and observation data. The evaluation indicates that the new model is accurate and efficient for simulating upward soil water flow in heterogeneous soils with complex boundary conditions. The new model is used for evaluating different drainage functions, and the square drainage function and the power drainage function are recommended. Computational efficiency of the new model makes it particularly suitable for large-scale simulation of soil water movement, because the new model can be used with coarse discretization in space and time.

AB The impacts of urbanization on floods, droughts and the overall river regime have been largely investigated in the past few decades, but the quantification and the prediction of such impacts still remain a challenge in hydrology. We gathered a sample of 142 catchments that have a documented increase in urban areas over the hydrometeorological record period in the United States. The changes in river flow regimes due to urban spread were differentiated from climate variability using the GR4J conceptual hydrological model. High, low and mean flows were impacted at a threshold of a 10% total impervious area. Moreover, the historical evolution of urban landscape spatial patterns was used to further detail the urbanization process in terms of extent and fragmentation of urban areas throughout the catchment and to help interpret the divergent impacts observed in streamflow behaviors. Regression analysis pointed out the importance of major wastewater treatment facilities that might overpass the effects of imperviousness, and therefore further research should either take them explicitly into account or select a wastewater facility-free catchment sample to clearly evaluate the impacts of urban landscape on low flows.

AB Despite its societal relevance, the question whether fluctuations in flood occurrence or magnitude are coherent in space has hardly been addressed in quantitative terms. We investigate this question for Germany by analysing fluctuations in annual maximum series (AMS) values at 68 discharge gauges for the common time period 1932-2005. We find remarkable spatial coherence across Germany given its different flood regimes. For example, there is a tendency that flood-rich/-poor years in sub-catchments of the Rhine basin, which are dominated by winter floods, coincide with flood-rich/-poor years in the southern sub-catchments of the Danube basin, which have their dominant flood season in summer. Our findings indicate that coherence is caused rather by persistence in catchment wetness than by persistent periods of higher/lower event precipitation. Further, we propose to differentiate between event-type and non-event-type coherence. There are quite a number of hydrological years with considerable nonevent-type coherence, i.e. AMS values of the 68 gauges are spread out through the year but in the same magnitude range. Years with extreme flooding tend to be of event-type and non-coherent, i.e. there is at least one precipitation event that affects many catchments to various degree. Although spatial coherence is a remarkable phenomenon, and large-scale flooding across Germany can lead to severe situations, extreme magnitudes across the whole country within one event or within one year were not observed in the investigated period.

AB The assessment for impacts of climate variability and human activities on suspended sediment yield (SSY) change has long been a question of great interest. However, the sediment generation processes are sophisticated with high nonlinearity and great uncertainty, which give rise to extreme complexity for SSY change assessment in Newtonian approach. Consequently, few approaches can be simply but widely applied to decompose impacts of climatic variability and human activities on SSY change. Thus, it is an urgent need to develop advanced methods that are simple and robust. Since that the Newtonian approach is hardly achievable due to limitation of either observations or knowledge of mechanisms, there have been repeated calls to capture the hydrologic system in Darwinian approach for hydrological change prediction or explanation. As streamflow is the carrier of suspended sediment, SSY change are thus documented in changes of sediment concentrated flow and suspended sediment concentration - water discharge (C-Q) relationships. By deduced corollaries, a differential equation of sediment discharge change was derived to explicitly decompose impacts of climate variability and human activities in Darwinian hydrology. Besides, a new form of sediment rating curves was proposed and curved as C-Q relationships and probability distribution of sediment concentrated flow. River sediment flux can be revealed by this representation, which simply elucidates mechanism of SSY generation covering a range of time scales from finer than rainfall-event to long term. By the new sediment rating curves, the differential equation was partly solved using a segmentation algorithm proposed and validated in this paper, and then was submitted to water balance framework expressed by Budyko-type equation. Thus, for catchment management, hydrologists can obtain explicit explanation of how climate variation and human activities propagate through landscape and result in sediment discharge change. The differential equation is simple and robust for widely application in sediment discharge change assessment, as only discrete data of precipitation, potential evaporation and C-Q observed at gauging stations are required.

AB Rapid groundwater depletion from the northwestern Indian aquifer system in the western Indo-Gangetic basin has raised serious concerns over the sustainability of groundwater and the livelihoods that depend on it. Sustainable management of this aquifer system requires that we understand the sources and rates of groundwater recharge, however, both these parameters are poorly constrained in this region. Here we analyse the isotopic (delta O-18, delta H-2 and tritium) compositions of groundwater, precipitation, river and canal water to identify the recharge sources, zones of recharge, and groundwater flow in the Ghaggar River basin, which lies between the Himalayan -fed Yamuna and Sutlej River systems in northwestern India. Our results reveal that local precipitation is the main source of groundwater recharge. However, depleted delta O-18 and delta H-2 signatures at some sites indicate recharge from canal seepage and irrigation return flow. The spatial variability of delta O-18, delta H-2, d -excess, and tritium reflects limited lateral connectivity due to the heterogeneous and anisotropic nature of the aquifer system in the study area. The variation of tritium concentration with depth suggests that groundwater above c. 80 mbgl is generally modern water. In contrast, water from below c. 80 mbgl is a mixture of modern and old waters, and indicates longer residence time in comparison to groundwater above c. 80 mbgl. Isotopic signatures of delta O-18, delta H-2 and tritium suggest significant vertical recharge down to a depth of 320 mbgl. The spatial and vertical variations of isotopic signature of groundwater reveal two distinct flow patterns in the aquifer system: (i) local flow (above c. 80 mbgl) throughout the study area, and (ii) intermediate and regional flow (below c. 80 mbgl), where water recharges aquifers through large-scale lateral flow as well as vertical infiltration. The understanding of spatial and vertical recharge processes of groundwater in the study area provides important baseline knowledge for developing a sustainable groundwater management plan for the northwestern Indian aquifer system.

AB The recharge mechanism of groundwater in the Badain Jaran Desert, North China has been a focus of research and still disputable in the past two decades. In this study, the chemical and hydrogen (H) and oxygen (0) isotopic characteristics of shallow groundwater, lake water and local precipitation in the Badain Jaran Desert and neighboring areas were investigated to reveal the relationships between various water bodies and the recharge source of shallow groundwater. Isotopic and hydrogeochemical results show that (I) shallow groundwater was associated with local precipitation in the Ayouqi and Yabulai regions, (2) lake water was mainly recharged by groundwater in the desert hinterland, (3) shallow groundwater of the desert hinterland, Yabulai Mountain and Gurinai Grassland had a common recharge source. Shallow groundwater of the desert hinterland had a mean recharge elevation of 1869 m a.s.l. on the basis of the isotope-altitude relationship and thus originated chiefly from lateral infiltration of precipitation in the Yabulai Mountain. It is further concluded that shallow groundwater flowed towards the Gurinai Grassland according to the groundwater table contour map. Along the flow pathway, the H-O isotopic variations were primarily caused by the evaporation effect but chemical variations of shallow groundwater were affected by multiple factors, e.g., evaporation effect, dilution effect of occasional heavy-precipitation and dissolution of aquifer evaporites. Our findings provide new insight into the groundwater cycle and benefit the management of the limited water resources in the arid desert area. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Water recirculation through permeable sediments induced by wave action, tidal pumping and currents enhances the exchange of solutes and fine particles between sediments and overlying waters, and can be an important hydro-biogeochemical process. In shallow water, most of the recirculation is likely to be driven by the interaction of wave-driven oscillatory flows with bottom topography which can induce pressure fluctuations at the sediment-water interface on very short timescales. Tracer-based methods provide the most reliable means for characterizing this short-timescale exchange. However, the commonly applied approaches only provide a direct measure of the tracer flux. Estimating water fluxes requires characterizing the tracer concentration in discharging porewater; this implies collecting pore water samples at shallow depths (usually a few mm, depending on the hydrodynamic dispersivity), which is very difficult with commonly used techniques. In this study, we simulate observed vertical profiles of radon concentration beneath shallow coastal lagoons using a simple water recirculation model that allows us to estimate water exchange fluxes as a function of depth below the sediment-water interface. Estimated water fluxes at the sediment water interface at our site were 0.18-0.25 m/day, with fluxes decreasing exponentially with depth. Uncertainty in dispersivity is the greatest source of error in exchange flux, and results in an uncertainty of approximately a factor-of-five. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY

DT Article
DE Unsaturated hydraulic conductivity; Peat; Moss; Compression
ID WATER-CONTENT; PEATLAND; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; GROWTH; SOILS
AB Due to the non-vascular nature of Sphagnum mosses, the capitula (growing surface) of the moss must rely solely on capillary action to receive water from beneath. Moss subsides and swells in accordance with water table levels, an effect called "mire-breathing", which has been thought to be a self-preservation mechanism, although no systematic studies have been done to demonstrate exactly how volume change affects hydrophysical properties of moss. In this study, the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity (Kunsat) and water content of two different species of Sphagnum moss were measured at different compression rates, up to the maximum of 77%. The findings show that the Kunsat increases by up to an order of magnitude (10x) with compression up to a certain bulk density of the moss, after which higher levels of compression result in lowered unsaturated hydraulic conductivity. This was coupled with an increase in soil water retention with increased compression. The increase of the Kunsat with compression suggests that the mire-breathing effect should be considered a self-preservation mechanism to provide sufficient amount of water to growing moss in times of low water availability.

This work builds on the DREAM(ABc) algorithm of Sadegh and Vrugt (2014) and enhances significantly the accuracy and CPU-efficiency of Bayesian inference with GLUE.

AB The utilization of ecosystem services in flood management is challenged by the complexity of human nature interactions and practical implementation barriers towards more ecosystem-based solutions, such as riverine urban areas or technical infrastructure. This paper analyses how flood management has dealt with trade-offs between ecosystem services and practical constrains towards more ecosystem-based solutions. To this end, we study the evolution of flood management in four case studies in the Dutch and German Rhine, the Hungarian Tisza, and the Chinese Yangtze basins during the last decades, focusing on the development and implementation of institutions and their link to ecosystem services. The complexity of human-nature interactions is addressed by exploring the impacts on ecosystem services through the lens of three management paradigms: (1) the control paradigm, (2) the ecosystem-based paradigm, and (3) the stakeholder involvement paradigm. Case study data from expert interviews and a literature search were structured using a database approach prior to qualitative interpretation. Results show the growing importance of the ecosystem-based and stakeholder involvement paradigms which has led to the consideration of a range of regulating and cultural ecosystem services that had previously been neglected. We detected a trend in flood management practice towards the combination of the different paradigms under the umbrella of integrated flood management, which aims at finding the most suitable solution depending on the respective regional conditions.

AB An improved general understanding of riverbed heterogeneity is of importance for all groundwater modeling studies that include river-aquifer interaction processes. Riverbed hydraulic conductivity (K) is one of the main factors controlling river-aquifer exchange fluxes. However, the meter-scale spatial variability of riverbed K has not been adequately mapped as of yet. This study aims to fill this void by combining an extensive field measurement campaign focusing on both horizontal and vertical riverbed K with a detailed geostatistical analysis of the meter-scale spatial variability of riverbed K. In total, 220 slug tests and 45 standpipe tests were performed at two test sites along the Belgian Aa River. Omnidirectional and directional variograms (along and across the river) were calculated. Both horizontal and vertical riverbed K vary over several orders of magnitude and show significant meter-scale spatial variation. Horizontal K shows a bimodal distribution. Elongated zones of high horizontal K along the river course are observed at both sections, indicating a link between riverbed structures, depositional environment and flow regime. Vertical K is lognormally distributed and its spatial variability is mainly governed by the presence and thickness of a low permeable organic layer at the top of the riverbed. The absence of this layer in the center of the river leads to high vertical K and is related to scouring of the riverbed by high discharge events. Variograms of both horizontal and vertical K show a clear directional anisotropy with ranges along the river being twice as large as those across the river. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB The current scientific investigation deals with some significant results pertaining to the effect of substituting lead oxide on properties of lithium borate glasses having composition xPbO center dot(30-x)Li2O center dot 70B(2)O(3) + 2 mol% MoO3 (x = 0, 2, 5, 7, 10, 12 and 15 mol%, PLBM1-7). These glasses have been synthesized through appropriate melt quench route and the non-crystalline phase formation has been confirmed through peak free X-ray diffraction measurements. Theoretical optical basicity (A(th)), density (p) and molar volume (17) are observed to increase with increase in PbO content. dc conductivity has been observed to exhibit mixed electronic-ionic behaviour. DTA has been carried out to determine glass transition (T-g), crystallization (T-x) and liquidus (T-1) temperature. FTIR spectra depicted that PbO is modifying the structure of lithium borate matrix. The optical absorption spectra reveals that optical band gap (Eopt) decreases with increasing contents of PbO at the cost of Li2O.

AB Despite numerous innovative research ideas and advances in coating manufacturing and testing, the phenomenon surrounding cathodic blistering in primers and top-coats is still unclear, especially in hypersaline media. In this work, we have discussed a new silica/polydimethylsiloxane synthetic route for Mg coating, and have also probed the fate of ionic/molecular migration within coating variants with varying crosslink densities in saturated NaCl solution. Corrosion resistance is observed to increase with silica content, and the optimum amount of tetra alkoxide needed to prepare an efficient corrosion resistant coating has been established. Improved corrosion resistance is attributed to the compact coating network with reticulate internal ceramic structures as well as the hydrophobic character of their polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) moiety. These protective silica-modified composite coating materials were synthesized using two end-capped PDMS molecules bearing reactive groups, epoxypropoxypropyl terminated PDMS and aminopropyl terminated PDMS, added in a fixed ratio, in combination with tetraethoxysilane. Their barrier properties on Mg alloy were examined by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy while the extent of coating degradation and blistering were probed using scanning electron microscopy after chloride-induced treatment.

AB Quinol:fumarate reductase (QFR) is an integral membrane protein and a member of the respiratory Complex II superfamily. Although the structure of Escherichia coli QFR was first reported almost twenty years ago, many open questions of catalysis remain. Here we report two new crystal forms of QFR, one grown from the lipidic cubic phase and one grown from dodecyl maltoside micelles. QFR crystals grown from the lipid cubic phase processed as P1, merged to 7.5 angstrom resolution, and exhibited crystal packing similar to previous crystal forms. Crystals grown from dodecyl maltoside micelles processed as P2(1), merged to 3.35 angstrom resolution, and displayed a unique crystal packing. This latter crystal form provides the first view of the E. coli QFR active site without a dicarboxylate ligand. Instead, an unidentified anion binds at a shifted position. In one of the molecules in the asymmetric unit, this is accompanied by rotation of the capping domain of the catalytic subunit. In the other molecule, this is associated with loss of interpretable electron density for this same capping domain. Analysis of the structure suggests that the ligand adjusts the position of the capping domain.

AB LaFeO3 nanoparticle-coupled TiO2 nanotube arrays (LaFeO3/TiO2 NTs) was synthesized by loading LaFeO3 nanoparticles on TiO2 NTs using an ultrasound-assisted impregnating method. LaFeO3 nanoparticles were first prepared by stearate precursor and then deposited on the TiO2 NTs which were grown on Ti foils by electrochemical anodization. The heterostructured LaFeO3/TiO2 NTs exhibited a higher visible light photocatalytic activity than TiO2 NTs and excellent photochemical stability. The feasibility of charge transfer in LaFeO3/TiO2 NTs was confirmed by PL and EIS. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of LaFeO3/TiO2 NTs is mainly attributed to the heterojunction between LaFeO3 and TiO2 NTs which promotes the transfer and separation of photogenerated charges.

AB A facile route was demonstrated for the synthesis of hierarchical porous ZnO microspheres based on a surfactant-free chemical solution method. The as-synthesized ZnO were assembled by large numbers of interleaving nanosheets and formed an open porous structure. Under UV irradiation, the as-synthesized ZnO exhibited photocatalytic property on the degradation of palm oil mill effluent (POME) solution. The Nb2O5 decorated ZnO photocatalysts (Nb2O5/ZnO) with enhanced photocatalytic performances were also synthesized via a facile and rapid route. Compared with ZnO, the Nb2O5(3 wt%)/ZnO exhibited the best POME degradation and colour removal efficiencies of 91.7% and 100%, respectively after 240 min irradiation. Phytotoxicity of the POME after Nb2O5/ZnO photocatalysis was significantly reduced via the measurement of radicle lengths of Vigna radiata. The observed results demonstrated the photocatalytic technology using hierarchical Nb2O5/ZnO composites had the potential to effectively purify wastewater. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) inherently exhibits deficient bonding to other materials because of its low surface energy. In this study, large-scale nanopatterns were introduced to nickel-titanium (NiTi) to achieve strongly tightened PTFE coating layers on the metal substrate. The nano-roughened NiTi surface was produced using target-ion induced plasma sputtering. Typical porous PTFE coating layers were observed, and PTFE was partially infiltrated into nanoscale pores. The mechanical stability of the PTFE coating was consequently enhanced, indicating the great potential of this coating for medical devices including catheters, stents, and guide wires.

AB In this paper, we have developed a new type of Cu nanoaggregates, which were agglomerated by 5 nm Cu nanoparticles. The nanoaggregates can be well sintered at very low temperature, and an excellent resistivity of 4.37 mu Omega cm was achieved after sintering at 250 degrees C, which is only 2.5 times larger than that of Cu bulk. A novel mechanism has been put forward to elucidate the sintering behavior for the Cu nanoaggregates. With the advantage of high sintering performance, this type of Cu nanoaggregates is promising to be widely used in various fields, such as printed electronics and microelectronic packaging.

The sample is characterized by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The film is constructed by interconnected Si-coated NiO nanosheet arrays. As an anode material for lithium-ion batteries, the film is analyzed by galvanostatic discharge-charge and cyclic voltammetry (CV). NiO/Si nanosheet arrays deliver higher capacity than that of NiO nanosheet arrays, and shows better cycling stability that of Si film.

AB This paper describes a new method for optimizing the cellular structure of AlMg4Si8 alloy foams manufactured via powder metallurgy. The cellular structure was improved by pretreating TiH2 with a layer of Sn powder, which was then remixed with an AlMg4Si8 alloy used as the raw material for the preparation of the precursor. TiH2 was completely encapsulated in the molten Sn at an early stage of foaming when the matrix alloy was still solid, so that liberated H-2 was fully captured when TiH2 began to decompose. The interpore flow of H-2 along the cracks in the solid matrix was avoided, improving the utilization ratio of TiH2 as a blowing agent. After determining that 4.0 wt% Sn cladding was capable of almost completely encapsulating 0.5 wt% TiH2, the final cellular structure was optimized and regular circular pores were obtained.

AB This paper investigates the evolution of the beta phase in laser deposited Ti-6Al-4V via track of the cyclic phase transformation processes by dilatation experiments and characterization of the laser deposited microstructures by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS). The formation temperature of the beta phase in as-received mill-annealed Ti-6Al-4V decreased with increasing number of thermal cycles at the heating and cooling rates of 50 degrees C/s, while the vanadium (V) content in the beta phase increased with decreasing beta phase formation temperature. The distribution of the V content in the beta phase in the laser deposited Ti-6Al-4V showed an increasing gradient from the top layer (i.e., the last deposited) to the fourth layer from the top, which is related to the thermal cycles and the formation temperature of the beta phase. The formation mechanism of the beta phase was discussed based on the experimental observations. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Yttrium oxide nanoparticles (Y2O3 NPs) are synthesized successfully using Forsythiae fructus aqueous fruit extract. The structrural and morphological properties of Y2O3 NPs were systematically studied by FTIR, SEM, TEM, XPS and XRD patterns. The results indicate the NPs with flake-like flower morphology. The overall results indicated that the green synthesized Y2O3 NPs exhibited potent anti-cancer activity against renal carcinoma cells. The synthesis method is inexpensive, eco-friendly, reduced harmful side effects and alternative to physical/chemical methods. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.
