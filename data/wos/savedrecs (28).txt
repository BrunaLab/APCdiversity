AB Knowledge of protein behavior/stability during freeze/thaw (FT) operations is essential for storage and production processes in the biopharmaceutical industry. FT stress involves freeze concentration, cold denaturation, and ice crystals formation which can result in protein aggregation. Therefore, it is important to understand the ongoing FT processes, and the influence of different solution parameters. In order to evaluate the ongoing processes during FT (up to - 80 degrees C), phase diagrams with lysozyme from chicken egg white and sodium chloride were generated. Thereby, three different buffer systems with varying buffer substances and ionic strengths at pH 3 and pH 5 were investigated. As indicators for the ongoing FT processes, the phase behavior, crystal morphology and solubility were used. An increased number of cycles led, for example, to the formation of micro crystals, sea urchin crystals - indicating LLPS and/or high supersaturation - and precipitate. Furthermore, the buffer substances had a more distinct influence on the phase behavior and morphology compared to the ionic strength differences. The solubility line itself was only shifted when distinct changes in the phase behavior could be observed. In summary, a tool was developed for using the phase behavior and especially the crystal morphology as indicator for underlying processes during FT operations.

AB Human organic anion transporter 4 (hOAT4) belongs to a class of organic anion transporters that exert critical function in the secretion, absorption, and distribution of numerous drugs in the body, such as anti-viral drugs, anti-cancer therapeutics, antibiotics, antihypertensive medicine, and anti-inflammatory drugs. hOAT4 is richly existent in the kidney and placenta. We previously established that serum-and glucocorticoid-inducible kinases (sgk) stimulate hOAT4 expression and transport activity by abrogating the inhibitory effect of a ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-2. Insulin is one of the upstream signaling molecules for sgk. We therefore investigated the effect of insulin on hOAT4 function. We showed that insulin stimulated hOAT4 expression and transport activity, and the action of insulin was abolished in cells overexpressing Nedd4-2-specific siRNA to knockdown the endogenous Nedd4-2. We further showed that insulin phosphorylated serine 327 on Nedd4-2 and weakened the interaction between hOAT4 and Nedd4-2. Interestingly, in cells overexpressing sgk2, the stimulatory effect of insulin on hOAT4 was diminished. In addition, the stimulatory effect of insulin on hOAT4 was blocked by wortmannin and buparlisib, two PI3K inhibitors. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that insulin stimulates hOAT4 expression and transport activity by abrogating the inhibition effect of Nedd4-2 on the transporter. Moreover, insulin regulates hOAT4 by competing with sgk2 rather than through sgk2.

AB Aiming at improving the protective effects of baicalin on the skin, new highly-biocompatible penetration enhancer containing vesicles (PEVs) were developed by modifying the base formulation of transfersomes with sorbitol, thus obtaining sorbitol-PEVs. An extensive evaluation of the physico-chemical features of both transfersomes and sorbitol-PEVs was carried out. Transfersomes were mainly close-packed, multi-compartment vesicles, while sorbitol-PEVs appeared mostly as single, spherical, unilamellar vesicles. All the vesicles were small in size (similar to 128 nm) and negatively charged (similar to -67 mV), without significant differences between the formulations. The in vitro delivery of baicalin to intact skin showed an improved ability of sorbitol-PEVs to favour the deposition of the flavonoid into the whole skin. In addition, the vesicular formulations protected keratinocytes and fibroblasts from oxidative stress and UV radiation, and promoted cell proliferation and migration, which favoured the closure of skin wound. Cell uptake was promoted as well, especially when sorbitol-PEVs were used.

AB Blocking a selected wavelength range from the light spectrum can have multiple benefits. Ultra-violet (UV) radiation is detrimental to the retina, necessitating its blocking through sunglasses and contact lenses. The near-visible light also has enough energy to cause damage but, is typically not blocked by commercial lenses. Filtering light can also be useful to patients with migraines, amblyopia, and color blindness. Here, to achieve blocking, incorporation of pigments extracted from colored agro-products into contact lenses is explored. Pigment extraction from food powders including turmeric, spinach, paprika, and woad powders in ethanol is demonstrated. Lens immersion in pigment concentrated ethanol is done to facilitate swelling, allowing rapid pigment uptake. Pigment incorporation ensures the absence of visible light scattering, lens opacity, and leaching. The characterization of pigmented lenses is done through absorptivity and transmittance measurements. Degradation measurements investigate the stability of the green pigment extract from spinach powder with time. p-HEMA and silicone hydrogels loaded with > 400 mu g/g turmeric pigment act as class 1 UV blockers retaining > 90% visible light transparency and screening > 95% of the UVR spectra. Spinach, paprika, and woad powder loaded silicone lenses mitigate > 20% visible light transmission from selective wavelengths finding applications in photophobia, amblyopia treatment, and color vision deficiency management.

ID RELEASE; FABRICATION
AB 3D-printing is a promising tool to pave the way to the widespread adaption of individualized medicine. Several printing techniques have been investigated and introduced to pharmaceutical research. Until now, only one 3D-printed medicine is approved on the US market. The medicine is manufactured via drop-on-powder deposition, which uses inkjet printing to jet a liquid binder on a powder bed to create 3D objects. However, inkjet processes are prone to nozzle clogging when binders or active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) are included in the printing ink. This renders the formulation development of the ink the most challenging step. In this study, different hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) grades were investigated as solid binders in the powder formulation on a commercially available DoP printer. The printed ink only consisted of a water/ethanol mixture. Formulations containing 70% caffeine as model API were developed and tablets printed. It was found that the friability of the tablets greatly depends on the particle size of the employed binder, whereas disintegration time and dissolution properties mainly depend on the viscosity of the employed binders. Higher viscous binders led to slower disintegration and dissolution whereas lower viscous binders led to faster disintegration and dissolution. The study demonstrates that HPC is a suitable solid binder for DoP printing and that 3D-DoP printing can be used to print robust dosage forms.

AB The extremely complex tumor microenvironment (TME) in humans is the major responsible for the therapeutic failure in cancer nanomedicine. A new concept of disease-driven nanomedicine, henceforth named "Theranomics", which attempts to target cancer cells and TME on the whole, represents an attractive alternative. Herein, a nanomedicine able to co-deliver doxorubicin and a tumor suppressive proteolytic protein such as collagenase-2 was developed. We successfully obtained superparamagnetic nanogels (SPIONs/Doco@Col) via the intermolecular azide-alkyne Huisgen cycloaddition. We demonstrated that a local ECM degradation and remodeling in solid tumors by means of collagenase-2 could enhance tumor penetration of nanomedicines and the in situ sustained release of the drug payload throughout 3-D tumor spheroids up to the core (parenchyma), thus enabling a synergistic and efficient anticancer effect toward highly invasive breast tumors. We illustrate that SPIONs/Doxo@Col is also capable of reducing the invasivity of cancer cells.

AB The present study focused on the effect of different feed frame components on the residence time distribution of a three-chamber feed frame system (Fill-O-Matic). A production-scale rotary tablet press was used to simulate the industrial manufacture of tablets. The powder residence time distribution was used to characterize the powder behavior in the Fill-O-Matic. Therefore, two powder blends based on microcrystalline cellulose, one of them serving as a plain powder blend (MCC blend) and the other blend (tracer blend) spray colored with an indigo carmine solution by a fluid bed granulator, were used. With these powder blends, the effect of the reduction of the Fill-O-Matic volume with a perspex disc on the residence time distribution was compared with the standard configuration of the Fill-O-Matic. Furthermore, the filling wheel design with regard to the rod shape and different gap size configurations between the feed frame and the die disc were investigated. Interestingly, the reduction of the feed frame volume led to a remarkable decrease of the mean residence time and the mean centered variance. Moreover, the results of the filling wheel design showed that the rod shape of the filling wheels had a high influence on the intermixing of the powder particles in the filling chamber, whereas the corresponding tablet weights and their relative standard deviation were not affected. The gap size between the feed frame and the die disc had low influence on the residence time distribution but an effect on the tablet weights and their standard deviation.

AB The oral cavity is of great importance to the performance of orally retained formulations, including: orally disintegrating tablets, taste-masked formulations, and buccal/sublingual delivery systems. With regards to in vitro dissolution assessment of these dosage forms, human saliva should be represented by the dissolution media. Currently there is no general consensus regarding oral cavity dissolution. In this study pooled human saliva was characterised and utilised as dissolution media for biorelevant oral cavity dissolution studies and to assess drug release. Lipophilic drug felodipine with challenging biopharmaceutical properties was selected for assessment in oral cavity dissolution studies. These saliva dissolution studies investigated for the first time how biorelevant dissolution can be implemented as a screening tool to guide the formulation development process and to predict dosage form performance within the mouth. In this study a combination of three dissolution enhancement strategies (cryomilling, solid dispersion, and inclusion complexation) were employed to eventually increase the concentration of felodipine in saliva 150-fold. Using this successful formulation strategy orally disintegrating tablets of felodipine were produced. Interestingly, the percentage release of felodipine in compendial dissolution apparatus was shown to be over 80% after 10 min. On the other hand, saliva-based dissolution showed that percentage release of felodipine was only 0.2% after 10 min using the same formulation. This discrepancy in drug release between dissolution media highlights the need for biorelevant dissolution apparatus for the oral cavity to reliably assess performance of relevant dosage forms in vitro.

AB Lactose, a disaccharide is a ubiquitous excipient in many pharmaceutical formulations which exists in two anomeric forms; either as alpha- or beta-lactose. The anomers have different properties which can affect their application. Nevertheless, batches of lactose products are widely produced by many manufacturers, and is available in many grades. However, the anomeric content of these batches has not been accurately characterized and reported previously. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyse a set of 19 commercially available samples of lactose using a novel H-1-NMR technique to establish a library showing the anomeric content of a large range of lactose products. The lactose samples were also analysed by DSC. The anomeric content of the alpha-lactose monohydrate samples were found to vary by more than 10%, which might influence bioavailability from final formulations. The data showed that there is a need to determine and monitor the anomeric content of lactose and this should be a priority to both the manufacturers and the formulators of medicines.

   colorectal liver metastasis
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICS

   acid recycling; Hyaluronic acid; Colorectal liver metastasis
AB Oral siRNA delivery is an ideal way to translate siRNA therapeutic effects in the clinic due to its ability to be administered in convenient and multiple dosages. However, an effective oral delivery system requires overcoming both a hostile gastrointestinal (GI) environment and non-specific targeting. Here, an HTsRP-NC system is a new oral siRNA delivery system consisting of a siRNA/protamine (sRP) nano-complex protected by a multifunctional hyaluronic acid-taurocholic acid (HA-TCA) conjugate. The HTsRP-NC promotes cell penetration and enhances endosomal escape in cancer cells. Moreover, protection of the sRP by HA-TCA from the hostile GI environment helps the AKT siRNA complex to reach the liver through the utilization of a TCA-mediated enterohepatic bile acid recycling system. AKT siRNA was released by 90% in presence of hyaluronidase in the tumor cells which indicate the potential use of HTsRP-NCs for siRNA delivery to treat tumor. After HA receptor (CD44)-mediated cellular uptake of the HTsRP-NC by the liver cancer cells, functional expression of AKT siRNA leads to the suppression of metastatic liver cancer growth in a colorectal liver metastasis (CLM) murine model. Tumor nodules were reduced by more than 1 mm size compared to control group and tumor cells were suppressed by 50% after HTsRP-NCs treatment with AKT siRNA. Overall, oral administration of the HTsRP-NC supports its potential in therapeutic applications for the effective treatment of CLM.

AB The mechanism underlying the skin permeation of flurbiprofen (FLU)-loaded, glyceryl monooleyl ether-based liquid crystalline nanoparticles (LCNs) with a hexagonal structure was examined by synchrotron X-ray diffraction and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Fluorescent-labeled, FLU-loaded LCNs were prepared using coumarin 6 and rhodamine B 1,2-dihexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine, triethylammonium salt (Rh-PE), which produce green and red fluorescence, respectively. Application of FLU-loaded LCNs to the hairless mouse stratum corneum (SC) induced expansion of the lattice spacing of the hexagonal structure with FLU release, as confirmed by the changes in the small-angle X-ray diffraction profiles. In addition, the FLU-loaded LCNs completely released FLU near the surface of the SC, which then penetrated the SC. Consequently, the repeat distance of the long periodicity phase was slightly modified. CLSM revealed green fluorescence in the epidermis and hair follicles and red fluorescence in the SC. In conclusion, LCNs adopt several permeation pathways: one is partly via the intercellular matrix and the other is the epidermis via hair follicles.

AB The anti-tumor efficacy of curcumin can be markedly improved by nano-drug self-delivery systems with high drug loading capacity and smart stimulus-triggered drug release in tumor cells. Herein, a type of novel, glutathione (GSH)-responsive, PEGylated prodrug nano-micelles (PPNMs) was prepared by self-assembly of curcumin-s-s-vitamin E/mPEG2k-DSPE mixture. The PPNMs (entrapment efficiency: 96.7%) was acceptably stable in water with a mean particle size of 29.84 nm. Compared with curcumin-loaded mPEG2k-DSPE nano-micelles (CUR-NMs), PPNMs showed a higher drug loading (1.68% vs 27.3%) and remarkably improved the chemical stability of curcumin in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) (pH = 7.4), 10% FBS culture medium, and rat plasma. In vitro release study showed that PPNMs could redox responsively control the release of curcumin from the prodrug. Moreover, PPNMs showed a cytotoxicity in HepG2 cells similar to that of the free curcumin; however, when the HepG2 cells were pretreated with 1 mM GSH, PPNMs displayed a markedly enhanced cytotoxicity and cellular uptake than the free curcumin. After intravenous injection, PPNMs showed an increased half-life in blood circulation (10.6-fold) and bioavailability (107-fold) compared with the free curcumin injection. Altogether, the prodrug nano-micelles represent a promising preparation for sustained and controlled delivery of curcumin with enhanced antitumor activity.

AB This study aimed to develop a dry powder inhaler (DPI) formulation for enhanced deep lung delivery of ri-fampicin using dextrans of different molecular weights. Porous particles were formed by a spray-drying method, which was designed based on the Peclet number. The morphology of particles containing both rifampicin and dextran was dependent on the dextran concentration. The D-50 values of SDPs containing rifampicin and dextran 40 or 70 at ratios of less than 1: 10 were below 5 mu m. The specific surface area values of spray-dried particles containing rifampicin and dextran 40 or 70 of more than 1: 10 were over 20m(2)/g, assuming that an increase in specific surface area was indicative of an increase in the formation ratio of a porous structure. DPI formulations that contained higher amounts of dextran had higher rifampicin contents. Thus, the formulations containing a dextran: rifampicin ratio of 1: 20 had approximately 100% drug encapsulation.
   The formation of the porous particles can be explained by the related Peclet number, which correlates with the viscosity and surface tension of the ethanol-water solution used in preparing the particles. It was noted that the existence ratio of the porous particles increased as the viscosity of the mixed solution was increased. Furthermore, an increase in the proportion of dextran resulted in higher rifampicin loading into the particles and the formation of finer particle fractions (FPF) (< 7.0 mu m at a rate of 28.3 L/min,< 4.8 um at a rate of 60.0 L/min). The formulations containing rifampicin and both dextrans at a ratio of more than 1: 10 consisted of approximately 50% FPF at a rate of 28.3 L/min and 60.0 L/min. The results indicate that dextran is suitable to obtain porous particles via spray-drying. Additionally, the existence ratio of the porous particles can be improved by increasing the viscosity of the solution used in the preparation of the particles.

AB Polyphosphates are important polyanionic electrolytes that play a major role in stabilization and consolidation of colloids surface and interior microstructures. In this study, the polyelectrolyte complexes (PEC) microcapsules (sodium cellulose sulfate-chitosan hydrochloride, sample 1), and the patched ones via sodium tripolyphosphate (sample 2), sodium pyrophosphate (sample 3) and sodium hexametaphosphate (sample 4) were fabricated under mild conditions. The effects of polyphosphates on the formation of the PEC microcapsules were investigated systematically. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) observation showed that both of the sample 2 and sample 3 had more compact interior microstructures with higher fluor-escence intensity, compared with the sample 4 with macroporous ones and sample 1 with irregular ones. Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) showed the electrostatic interactions occurred among the -NH3+ groups, -SO3- groups, HP3O104- groups, P2O74- groups and H2PO4- groups, and the sample 2 and sample 3 had a more thermal stability comparatively. The sample microcapsules showed good capacity of drug loading and encapsulation efficiency (max. 66.9 +/- 4.6% and 74.2 +/- 5.1%). In the in vitro release studies showed that the sample 2 and sample 3 had a larger accumulative drug release rate of 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) at the same time point and released completely at 12 h; the drug release mechanisms analysis indicated that the sample 1 and sample 3 were mainly diffusion controlled, while the sample 2 and sample 4 were followed the mechanism of non-Fickian transport. Under the polyphosphate's consolidation, the PEC microcapsules fabricated with sustained drug release profiles could be used as the promising drug vehicles.

AB Multi-cycle treatment strategies were frequently applied in anti-tumor therapy in clinic. However, numerous tumors developed drug resistance during this process, and few researches paid attention to the multi-cycle treatment process when a nano carrier was adopted. In this research, a glycolipid-like nanocarrier encapsulating anti-tumor drug doxorubicin (DOX) was adopted to perform a long term drug stimulation in vitro cell line and a tri-cycle treatment on xenograft tumors to explore its effect in process of developing drug resistance. As expected, tumors treated by free doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX.HCl) showed obvious increase of P-glycoprotein, while for tumors treated by nanocarrier encapsulated doxorubicin, the P-glycoprotein level stayed low as untreated group. Further exploration found that MDR1 gene transcription got involved in the resistance induction mechanism as its mRNA levels in DOX.HCl stimulated cells were thousands of times of those in parent cell. It concluded that tri-cycle therapy with the glycolipid-like nanocarrier would not result in acquired drug resistance. These results also implied that nano-drug delivery possessed ability in avoiding acquiring drug resistance ability during long-term treatment which may have potential use in clinic.

TI smartPearls - Novel physically stable amorphous delivery system for

AB Dermally applied poorly soluble actives whether in cosmetics or pharmaceuticals show insufficient skin penetration. Especially actives being insoluble in both phases of dermal vehicles, i.e. water and oil have no or less real effect. An approach to overcome this obstacle is the use of amorphous actives instead of the crystalline ones. The higher saturation solubility creates an increased concentration gradient between the formulation and skin. Thus, the diffusive flux into the skin is improved. However, the amorphous state of actives is highly labile, and the durability of such formulations would be too short for a marketable product. smartPearls is a novel technology efficiently long-term stabilize the amorphous state. They consist of mu m sized particles with mesopores (e.g. silica: SYLOID (R), AEROPERL (R), Neusilin (R)), in which the active can be loaded and preserved in amorphous state. Due to the tightness of the pores, not enough space is given for re-crystallization. In this work, the skin penetration of poorly soluble actives loaded in smartPearls is compared to the present "gold standards" in dermal delivery, e.g. amorphous microparticles, amorphous nanoparticles and nanocrystals. The performance was at least similar or even better than the gold standards, explainable by the increased saturation solubility of active due to a) amorphous state and b) nanostructure inside the mu m-sized particles. Sedimentation investigations showed, that the physical stabilization of very dense smartPearls in semi-solid vehicles is possible by viscoelastic repulsion. Also, the technical, regulatory and marketing aspects for the use of smartPearls technology in products are discussed, e.g. status of excipients used, and advantages of not being a nanoparticle, but being as efficient as them. Overall, smartPearls proved to be a promising dermal delivery technology for poorly soluble actives with a high market potential.

AB The lack of efficient and cost-effective methods for gene delivery has significantly hindered the applications of gene therapy. In this paper, a simple one step and cost effective salting-out method has been explored to fabricate silk-PEI nanoparticles (SPPs) and magnetic-silk/PEI core-shell nanoparticles (MSPPs) for targeted delivery of c-myc antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) into MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. The size and zeta potential of the particles were controlled by adjusting the amount of silk fibroin in particle synthesis. Lower surface charges and reduced cytotoxicity were achieved for MSPPs compared with PEI coated magnetic nanoparticles (MPPs). Both SPPs and MSPPs were capable of delivering the ODNs into MDA-MB-231 cells and significantly inhibited the cell growth. Through magnetofection, high ODN uptake efficiencies (over 70%) were achieved within 20 min using MSPPs as carriers, exhibiting a significantly enhanced uptake effect compared to the same carriers via non-magnetofection. Both SPPs and MSPPs exhibited a significantly higher inhibition effect against MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells compared to human dermal fibroblast (HDF) cells. Targeted ODN delivery was achieved using MSPPs with the help of a magnet, making them promising candidates for targeted gene therapy applications.

AB Flowability is a key consideration during the formulation and process development of oral solid dosage forms as it can have a critical impact on product quality. With a limited number of examples available in the literature, there is a need to better understand and share the typical flow properties of pharmaceutical materials. Here, historical data (3909 experiments) from a shear cell apparatus were extracted and analysed. These data were composed of different material types, including APIs, excipients, blends and granules from nearly a decade of development projects. APIs were found to have poor flow properties (ff(c) < 2), while other materials (excipients, blends and granules) generally had good flow properties. This analysis provided an enhanced understanding of the typical flow properties of pharmaceutical materials. By combining these data with information on the process and achieved drug load, it was possible to characterise our current operating space as a process flow map which could be used to focus future development.

AB Targeting mitochondrial redox homeostasis is an appealing methodology for cancer therapeutics because of the upregulated antioxidant capacity in drug resistance cases. By coupling triphenylamine (TPA) with an excellent fluorescent group BODIPY, a novel mitochondrial-targeted fluorescent probe, BODIPY-TPA (BTPA), was synthesized and characterized. Confocal microscopic colocalization imaging indicated that BTPA exhibited a subcellular mitochondrial distribution. Cytotoxicity experiments suggested that BTPA exhibited selective anticancer activity via the induction of mitochondrial dysfunction in BGC-823 cancer cells. BTPA induced alterations in mitochondrial redox homeostasis because of the electron-donating property of TPA and mitochondrial selectivity. In further studies, TrxR2 in the mitochondria was alternatively inhibited, which contributed to MtROS accumulation further attenuated PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. The resultant decline in mitochondrial antioxidant capacity aggravated mitochondrial oxidative stress, which is responsible for cytochrome C release and caspase-9 activation. NAC completely reversed BTPA-induced ROS-dependent mitochondrial-mediated intrinsic apoptosis. Therefore, BTPA was designed as a superior fluorescent cancer-imaging probe and a mitochondrial redox-targeting anticancer agent.

AB In the last years, the antimicrobial resistance against antibiotics has become a serious health issue, arise as global threat. This has generated a search for new strategies in the progress of new antimicrobial therapies. In this context, different nanosystems with antimicrobial properties have been studied. Specifically, magnetic nano-particles seem to be very attractive due to their relatively simple synthesis, intrinsic antimicrobial activity, low toxicity and high versatility. Iron oxide NPs (IONPs) was authorized by the World Health Organization for human used in biomedical applications such as in vivo drug delivery systems, magnetic guided therapy and contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging have been widely documented. Furthermore, the antimicrobial activity of different magnetic nanoparticles has recently been demonstrated. This review elucidates the recent progress of IONPs in drug delivery systems and focuses on the treatment of infectious diseases and target the possible detrimental biological effects and associated safety issues.

AB This study systemically investigated the application of core/shell technique to improve powder compactability. A 28-run Design-of-Experiment (DoE) was conducted to evaluate the effects of the type of core and shell materials and their concentrations on tensile strength and brittleness index. Six machine learning algorithms were used to model the relationships of product profile outputs and raw material attribute inputs: response surface methodology (RSM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and four different types of artificial neural networks (ANN), namely, Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN), Genetic Algorithm Based BPNN (GA-BPNN), Mind Evolutionary Algorithm Based BPNN (MEA-BPNN), and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). Their predictive and generalization performance were compared with the training dataset as well as an external dataset. The results indicated that the core/shell technique significantly improved powder compactability over the physical mixture. All machine learning algorithms being evaluated provided acceptable predictability and capability of generalization; furthermore, the ANN algorithms were shown to be more capable of handling convoluted and non-linear patterns of dataset (i.e. the DoE dataset in this study). Using these models, the relationship of product profile outputs and raw material attribute inputs were disclosed and visualized.

AB Dry granulation is the preferred technique for solvent-sensitive products, especially drugs with stability problems such as hydrolysis. Twin-screw granulation is a continuous granulation technique, offering a potential alternative to conventional dry granulation techniques such as roller compaction. The major advantage of twin-screw granulation is the ability to adjust process parameters of dry granulation without compromising the compression properties. This study was aimed to perform exploratory studies of heat-assisted continuous twin-screw dry granulation process to formulate sustained release tablets for APIs with different melting points: theophylline, acetaminophen and lidocaine hydrochloride hydrate. Granulation feasibility was studied with different binders (e.g. Klucel (TM) EF, Kollidon (R) VA64), sustained release agents (e.g. Klucel (TM) MF, Eudragit (R) RSPO) and diluents at various drug loads. The processing conditions were below the melting point or glass transition temperature of the formulation ingredients. After successful granulation, DSC and XRD studies revealed the crystalline nature of the granules and FTIR studies showed no interaction of the API with the excipients. The granules were compressed into sustained release tablets without any compressibility issues. The tablets were stable after testing for 6 months at 25 degrees C/60% RH. This novel continuous dry granulation technique may offer an excellent alternative to conventional dry granulation techniques.

AB Two pharmaceutical polymers with high glass transition temperatures (T-g > 100 degrees C), polyvinylpyrrolidone-vinyl acetate copolymer (PVPVA) and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate succinate (HPMCAS), have been assessed for their impact on the storage stability of itraconazole (ITZ) amorphous solid dispersions (ASDs). The results showed that the inhibitory effect of PVPVA on the recrystallization of amorphous ITZ was highly sensitive to surrounding relative humidity (RH), especially at RH above 60%. In contrast, amorphous ITZ in HPMCAS matrix exhibited much stronger resistance to recrystallization even under high RH conditions, reflecting the superior crystallization-inhibitory effect of HPMCAS. While the ITZ loads in the two polymers far exceeded the respective thermodynamic solubility limits, both ASD systems remained physically stable over an extended storage period at RH <= 60%. Kinetics rather than thermodynamics dictate the physical stability of ITZ ASDs. Crystallization of ITZ in ASDs appears to involve a complex interplay of multiple factors, including polymer type, glass transition temperatures (T(g)s) of drug and polymer, crystallization tendency of amorphous drug, and storage conditions. Specifically, with respect to the impact of polymer type, HPMCAS is particularly effective for maintaining the storage stability of ITZ ASDs, which can be attributed to its higher Tg and lower hydrophilicity.

AB The increasing application of Single-Use Systems (SUSs) in pharmaceutical manufacturing lines poses a potential risk of polymer-related impurities leaching into the process stream and persisting through the manufacturing process. To minimize any potential toxicity and impairment to the product's quality, safety thresholds are strictly regulated and enforced in particular for parenteral solutions. At present, impurities are estimated from extractable profiles, which are generated for each SUS with thermal or static extraction. In this study we employed target leachable-testing by taking samples directly from an industrial filling line probed during real-life processing of three parenteral drugs (n = 2) under actual process-conditions, to estimate the concentration of leachables throughout drug-manufacturing. At five different points, samples were drawn to study the individual impact of SUSs on the leachable accumulation within the drug-filling process. The drug products were examined for leachables using stir-bar-sorptive-extraction (SBSE) with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and ethylene glycol (EG)-PDMS coated stir-bars. Subsequent extraction from the stir-bars and analysis of the substances was performed with TD-GC-MS and solvent-back-extraction (SBE)-UPLC/QTOF-MS/MS analytics. Our study revealed the following main results: 1) Leachables were found in extremely low concentrations, all below toxicological thresholds (highest leachable concentration in the final drug product 1 (DP1): 0.274 ppm < drug specific threshold: 6.0 ppm vertical bar DP2: 0.010 ppm < 0.2 ppm vertical bar DP3: 0.011 ppm < 0.5 ppm). All compounds identified in the leachables study were found to be non-genotoxic. 2) Most of the leachables (68%) that were found were already observed at the beginning of the filling process, delivered by the API Neither a common source of leaching could be identified within the filling-line nor a specific product influence on quality or quantity of leachables. 3) No leachable increase could be observed over the filling process. On the contrary leachable concentrations declined with 83%, which was partly due to dilution by buffer-feed and to a proven absorption of leachables by filters and silicon tubing.

AB Sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides, SB) leaves contain wide-ranging bioactive compounds. Processing of the leaves into beverages/food presents great potential for supporting human health. The research aimed to investigate the impact of different processing methods on phenolic compounds and antioxidant activities of tea-type infusions prepared from SB leaves. Leaves of two SB cultivars, 'Terhi' and 'Tytti', were processed with different methods commonly used for tea processing. Phenolic compounds in the infusions were analyzed with High-Performance Liquid Chromatography-Diode-Array Detection and High-Performance Liquid Chromatography Electrospray Ionization-Tandem Mass Spectrometry. Isorhamnetin-3-O-glucoside-7-O-rhamnoside, isorhamnetin-3-O-rutinoside and kaempferol-3-O-hexoside-7-O-rhamnoside were the three major flavonol glycosides, stachyurin and casuarinin were the most abundant ellagitannins. The infusions of 'Tytti' contained more total phenolics than those of 'Terhi' (p < 0.05). High temperature processing resulted in higher content of total phenolics and ellagitannins in the infusions compared with low temperatures (p < 0.05). Thermal processing decreased the antioxidant activities of the infusions.

AB Deterioration of frying oil greatly affects the nutrition of fried foods. In this study, influence of fried food and oil type on the distribution of polar compounds in oils at total polar compound (TPC) of 24%, 25% and 27% was evaluated. Both food and oil significantly affected the composition of frying oil (P < 0.01) and the effect of oil was relatively more significant than that of food. Five groups of polar compounds were presented: triglyceride oligomer (TGO), triglyceride dimer (TGD), oxidized triglyceride monomer (oxTGM), diglyceride (DG) and free fatty acid (FFA). TGD and DG had the highest contents, up to 6.9%-7.5% and 8.1%-8.9% respectively, while FFA had the lowest content with 1.4%-1.7%. The compound of the greatest concern in frying oil, oxTGM, varied from 4.6% to 4.8%, when TPC reached 24%-27%. Data will be expected to provide the evidence for toxicological evaluation of fried oils and foods in restaurants.

AB An innovative procedure for plant chloroplasts isolation has been proposed, which consists of juice extraction by physical fractionation from plant material and recovery of its chloroplast-rich fraction (CRF) by centrifugation. This simple method has been applied to pea vine haulm subjected to different post-harvest treatments: blanching, storage at different relative humidity values and fermentation. Additionally, freeze storage of the extracted juice was carried out. The macronutrient (total lipids, proteins, ash and carbohydrates) and micronutrient (fatty acids, chlorophylls, beta-carotene, alpha-tocopherol and ascorbic acid) content and composition of the CRF have been determined. The CRF isolated from fresh pea vine haulm is a potential source of essential micronutrients (alpha-linolenic acid, beta-carotene, alpha-tocopherol) and carbohydrates, whereas the post-harvest treatments trialled have a detrimental effect on the nutritional content. Industrial applications for the recovered nutritionally rich fraction, such as food supplement ingredient or animal feeding, are likely envisaged, while optimising the use of green haulm.

AB Seed coats of coloured dry beans contain biologically active compounds. Flavonol glycosides were identified from acetone extracts of seed coats of black beans, pinto beans, and red kidney beans and evaluated for antioxidant activity. High Performance Liquid Chromatography - Mass Spectrometry/Mass Spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging capacity were used to measure flavonols and antioxidant capacity, respectively. The main flavonol glycosides in black beans were the 3-O-glycosides of kaempferol, quercetin and myricetin; pinto beans contained kaempferol 3-O-glycosides, while red kidney beans contained quercetin 3-O-glycoside and quercetin 3-O-rutinoside (rutin). A flavonol triglycoside was identified in dark red kidney bean. Despite differences in total flavonol content, extracts from Eclipse, (black bean) and Windbreaker (pinto bean) had the significantly higher antioxidant activities than other bean seed coats. Results suggest seed coats of Windbreaker and Eclipse may have potential as functional food ingredients, though benefits may not be simply due to flavonols.

AB Soy isoflavones (SIs) are abundant in soybeans and have inhibitory effects on contact hypersensitivity (CHS), which is often used as a mouse model for allergic contact dermatitis (ACD); however, their therapeutic mechanisms remain unknown. We studied the suppressive activity of dietary SI and gut microbiota on dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB)-induced CHS. Low-dose SI diets alleviated DNFB-induced ear swelling and oedema and decreased infiltration of Gr-1-positive cells into ear tissue. In addition, dietary SIs also decreased interleukin-1 beta and chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 production in ear tissue compared to controls. Furthermore, ciprofloxacin and metronidazole treatments blocked the suppressive activity of dietary SIs on CHS, whereas vancomycin treatment had a marginal effect. These antibiotic treatments differed in their effects on the gut microbiota composition. These results demonstrated that consumption of physiologically relevant doses of SIs reduced CHS symptoms, and suggested that the gut microbiota influenced their suppressive activities on CHS.

AB The aim of the present study was to perform simultaneous alcoholic and malolactic wine fermentations using free or immobilized kefir culture at a wide temperature range (5-45 degrees C). Repeated batch fermentations were carried out for a period up to 29 months, suggesting a high operational stability of the systems, while malic acid conversion and ethanol productivity up to 70.9% and 36.9 g/(Ld) were noted. Volatile acidity was at levels typically found in wines (< 1.0 g acetic acid/L) in most cases, although increased values were recorded in wines produced at 5 degrees C, but no vinegar taint was detected. Fusel alcohols were at levels usually found in wines, but were reduced at 5 degrees C. Application of PCA to minor volatiles showed that the fermentation temperature rather than the nature of kefir culture had a significant effect. Noticeably, all products were accepted by the panel during the preliminary sensory evaluation.

AB Yellow or green spots related to pigment changes found at the early stage of oleocellosis can cause severe economic damage. However, little information exists on pigment changes during oleocellosis development, so this study investigated the main changes in chlorophyll and carotenoid metabolites and related gene expression. Among the variations, the increased contents of chlorophyll a and b, and decreased concentrations of lutein, beta-cryptoxanthin, zeaxanthin, violaxanthin, alpha-carotene and beta-carotene were responsible for chlorophyll and carotenoid changes, respectively. Regarding gene expression, the up-regulated genes, magnesium chelatase subunit H (MgCh), magnesium-protoporphyrin IX monomethyl ester (oxidative) cyclase 1/2 (MPEC1/2), protochlorophyllide reductase a, chloroplastic 1/2 (PORA1/ 2) and chlorophyllide a oxygenase (CAO), regarding chlorophyll synthesis as well as the down-regulated genes, phytoene synthase (PSY), phytoene dehydrogenase (PDS), lycopene beta-cyclase (LCYb), and zeaxanthin epoxidase 1/2 (ZEP 1/2) and the up-regulated genes (+)-abscisic acid 8'-hydroxylase 1/2 (ABA-HX 1/2), regarding carotenoid metabolism, constituted the major variations in oleocellosis peels.

AB Gold nanoparticles@Carbon quantum dots nanocomposites (Au@CQDs) were designed for analyzing melamine in milk visually. Fluorescent emission of Au@CQDs enhanced with the increase of melamine concentration. A calibration curve (R-2 = 0.9856) and fluorescence standard array were established for detection of melamine in the range of 1 mu M-10 mu M. Limit of quantification and limit of detection were 12 nM and 3.6 nM, respectively. The approximate concentration of melamine adulterated in milk samples were detected visually by the fluorescence standard array and smartphone. The accurate concentration was obtained by the calibration curve and portable fluorescence spectrometer with recoveries of 105.64%-102.75% and less than 2% of coefficient of variation (CV) (n = 18). This performance was consistent with that of the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method (recoveries of 105.56%-107.95% with 2.24%-3.56% of CVs). The Au@CQDs-based fluorescent method for visual and accurate detection of melamine in milk was presented and showed strong application potential.

AB The composition of honey influences how beneficial it is to human health. This study evaluated the physiochemical properties and total phenolic content (TPC) of single vs. multi-floral Irish and selected international honeys, and whether properties varied according to hive location. Oilseed rape honey had the lowest TPC of Irish unifloral honeys. Heather honey had the highest TPC, similar to Manuka honey (Mean +/- SD= 68.16 +/- 2.73 and 62.43 +/- 10.03 respectively), and the TPC of ivy honey was approximately half that of heather. Urban multi-floral honeys contained higher TPC (28.26 +/- 13.63) than rural honeys (20.32 +/- 11.54). Physiochemical properties varied according to floral origin, and whether hives were in urban or rural sites. Irish heather honey had similar physiochemical characteristics to Manuka honey. This first examination of Irish honey confirms that TPC and physiochemical properties vary with honey type and hive location, and suggests that Irish heather honey should be examined for potential health benefits.

AB To better understand the effect of interesterified blend-based fast-frozen special fat (IBSF) on the quality of frozen dough, the physical properties and microstructure of frozen dough were investigated. The presence of IBSF in the frozen dough increased the gelatinization enthalpy (from 0.16 to 0.26 J/g) and decreased the degree of retrogradation (from 81.3% to 53.8%). The frozen dough added with IBSF also exhibited enhanced extensibility and greater flexibility. Data of DSC and Low-field NMR demonstrated that addition of IBSF significantly reduced the freezable water content and mobility of free water. SEM analysis showed that the starch granules were arranged in the gluten network of frozen dough. Compared with the corresponding physical blend-based special fat and commercial special fat, IBSF not only exhibited favorable influence on the quality of frozen dough, but didn't have trans-fatty acid. These results suggest that IBSF is promising in the preparation of prefrozen fast food.

AB Effect of phosphates on the heat-induced gel characteristics of myofibrillar protein (MP) from grass carp was investigated. Both heating and phosphates exerted significant influences. Heating induced more elastic, water-holding and less flowing gel. But phosphates had diverse effects at different temperatures. At 4 degrees C and 40 degrees C, phosphate as a dominant factor reduced the gel elasticity and resistance and increased flowability with increasing levels of phosphates. Furthermore, 280 mg/kg sodium pyrophosphate (SPP) or 440 mg/kg sodium triphosphates (STP) transformed MP from weak gel into concentrated solution. It clarified phosphates disentangled MP macromolecules and inhibited their aggregation and pre-gelation at low temperature. At 80 degrees C, heating accompanied with phosphates governed MP gelation. The appropriate level of phosphates (SPP superior to STP) endowed MP-phosphate gels with the lowest flowability and greatest elasticity, textural properties as well as finest microstructures. Besides, phosphates entrapped a portion of weak immobile water more tightly into smaller-sized pores of protein network.

AB The metabolite profiling of extracts from Adansonia digitata L. (baobab) fruit pulp and leaf, and the quantification of their major components, was conducted by means of reverse-phase, high-performance liquid chromatography with photodiode array detection, coupled to electrospray ion-trap mass spectrometry (RP-HPLC-PDA-ESI-MS/MS) and high field nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Water-soluble metabolites from chemical classes including sugars, amino acids, organic acids, and phenolic compounds, were identified, in addition to metabolites soluble in organic solvents such as triacylglycerides, sterols, and fatty acids, and most of these were quantified. The profiling of the primary and secondary metabolites of baobab fruit and leaves addresses the limited knowledge of the chemical composition of baobab, and helps support and explain the growing evidence on its nutritional and biological properties, and provide suggestions about the possible uses of baobab fruit and leaves by food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries.

AB Change in quality of mussels (Mytilus edulis) meat when stored at 4 degrees C was evaluated by determining volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N), peroxide value (POV), thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS), total oxidation (TOTOX), lipid class, fatty acid (FA), phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylcholine (PE) content, and glycerophospholipid (GP) molecular species. After 4 days of storage, the percentages of triacylglycerol and polar lipid as well as the contents of PC, PE and major GP molecular species significantly decreased (P < 0.05), while the percentages of free FA and monoacylglycerol significantly increased (P < 0.05), indicating the hydrolysis of lipids. The increase in activities of phospholipase and lipase during storage suggests that they may contribute to the hydrolysis of lipids. The cold storage also resulted in significantly increased POV, TBARS and TOTOX as well as lipoxygenase activity (P < 0.05) but slightly decreased percentage of polyunsaturated FA (PUFA), indicating the occurrence of lipid oxidation.

AB This study aimed to investigate the cytoprotective effects of flavonoids, their metabolites alone or in combination against hypoxia/reoxygenation induced oxidative stress in the transformed human first trimester trophoblast cell line (HTR-8/SVneo).
   Oxidative stress was achieved with hypoxia followed by reoxygenation and the following assays were performed: MTT, CellTox (TM) Green Cytotoxicity, CellTiter-Glo (R), NADP/NADPH-Glo (TM), ROS-Glo (TM)/H2O2, GSH/GSSG-Glo (TM) and Caspase-Glo (R) 3/7 assays.
   HTR-8/SVneo cells, pre-treated for 24 h with flavonoids or their metabolites were protected significantly from oxidative stress. Flavonoids were associated with ROS modulation, reducing the generation of superoxide/hydrogen peroxide. The activities of caspases 3/7 were also significantly reduced significantly in HTR-8/SVneo cells pre-treated with flavonoids.
   This study has shown for the first time that 24 h pre-treatment with flavonoids, their metabolites alone or in combination, protected against HR-induced oxidative stress in the trophoblast cell line. These data indicate that dietary flavonoids may be beneficial to placental health and invasion during early gestation.

AB A rapid and portable analytical methodology has been developed for ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) quantification from aqueous samples using a spectrometric smartphone-based system for the first time. The method employs point-of-use approaches both for sample preparation and sample measurement, demonstrating the capability for mobile quality control of pharmaceutical and food products. Our approach utilizes an oxidation-reduction reaction between ascorbic acid and methylene blue, followed by a dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (DLLME) to extract the aqueous-phase methylene blue into organic media. Then, a back-extraction procedure is employed to transfer the methylene blue to aqueous media, followed by analysis of the sample's absorption spectrum using the spectrometric smartphone-based system. The DLLME and back-extraction procedures are optimized by use of a two-step multivariate optimization strategy. Finally, vitamin C supplements and orange juice are used as real-world samples to assess the applicability of the smartphone-based method, which is successfully compared with the standard laboratory-based approach.

AB A highly sensitive analytical method was developed and validated, following international guidelines, for the determination of the residues of five macrocyclic lactones (MLs) (abamectin, doramectin, eprinomectin, ivermectin and moxidectin) in cheese. The extracts were concentrated by rotary-evaporation and derivatized; no clean-up was necessary. Despite matrix complexity, no significant matrix-effect was verified, and standards were prepared in solvents. Linear working ranges varied from 0.25 to 5.0 mu g L-1. Excellent limits of quantification (0.58-0.87 mu g kg(-1)), mean recoveries (91-103%), and repeatability and intermediate precision (< 5.8%) were obtained. Twenty-two samples of bovine and non-bovine cheeses were analyzed. Twenty-one samples showed residues of at least one ML (between 0.59 and 15.3 mu g kg(-1)), but moxidectin was never detected; a sample of mozzarella was free of MLs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method describing the simultaneous evaluation of these MLs in cheese using HPLC and fluorescence detection.

AB Here, for the first time, we developed Raman spectroscopy in combination with chemometrics for the quantification of adulteration of fresh coconut water by dilution, and its masking with sugars. Coconut water was extracted from young Costa Rican coconuts and heat treated to emulate pasteurization. Samples were then adulterated by dilution with water and single sugars, mixtures of sugars, and high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS). A total of 155 samples were analysed with Raman spectroscopy at 785 nm excitation and 620 spectra analysed with chemometrics. Results showed successful quantification of dilution and adulteration with single sugars between 1.9 and 2.6%, masking of dilution with mixtures of sugars at 9.8%, and masking of dilution with HFCS at 7.1%. It can be concluded that Raman spectroscopy has significant potential as a rapid accurate analytical method for the detection of adulteration in this product, with the ability to discern small abnormalities in sugar ratios within coconut water.

AB Alkali extraction and acid precipitation methods were adopted to isolate protein from quinoa and album seeds of variety Chenopodium. Different pH dispersions (3-11) of isolated proteins were prepared and effects of pH and holding time on protein characteristics were evaluated. The pH-10 of extraction medium was found suitable for protein extraction on the basis of yield, purity, solubility and colour having isoelectric pH of 4.5. Yield and purity of protein isolates (PI) of quinoa and album varied from 8.12 to 12.22%; 74.19 to 85.07% and 7.71 to 10.98%; 77.16 to 86.12%, respectively. Overall, pH and time had significant effect on functional properties of PI of both seeds. Quinoa PI had higher emulsifying activity, emulsion stability, water binding capacity and dispersibility, whereas, foaming capacity and stability were higher for album PI. Nutritional indices were 64.20 and 64.58 for quinoa and album PI, respectively, whereas, amino acid scoring (FAO, 2013) indicated, isoleucine, leucine and valine as the limiting amino acids.

AB Beetroot is recognized as health promoting food due to presence of essential components such as vitamins, minerals, phenolics, carotenoids, nitrate, ascorbic acids and betalains that promote health. Betalains occur in two forms i.e. betacyanin (red-violet pigment) and betaxanthin (yellow-orange pigment) and are recognizable commercially as a food dye due to non-precarious, non-toxic, non-carcinogenic and non-poisonous nature. Beetroot is premeditated as a boon for the food industry and used as food colorant or additive in food products such as ice-cream, yogurts and other products. The beetroot extract is used to improve the redness in tomato pastes, soups, sauces, desserts, jams, jellies, sweets and breakfast cereals. Overall objective of this review is to provide a brief knowledge about the valuable phytochemicals and bioactive compounds present in beetroot and their association with health benefits, beetroot processing for food application and their effect on beetroot pigment.

AB The effects of selenium (Se) on the protein content, amino acid profile, secondary structure and subunit composition of soy proteins and its distribution were evaluated, as was the effect of peroxyl radicals produced by thermal decomposition of AAPH on the conformational changes of Se-enriched beta-conglycinin (S-7S). The Se biofortification ability of soy was very strong, 7S had strongest ability to incorporate Se, and lower amounts of inorganic Se existed in Se-enriched beans. Se could promote protein synthesis and thus improve the protein content, increase the total amino acid content with a decrease in cysteine, combine into low-molecular-weight proteins, and influence the secondary structure of soybean proteins. Se was involved in the relevant protein changes in surface hydrophobicity, intrinsic fluorescence, infrared absorption and solubility and played an antioxidant role as an effectual "protector" to reduce the influence of peroxyl radical oxidation on S-7S, thereby maintaining the structural rearrangement between aggregation and protein unfolding.

AB In this study, we have evaluated by HPLC-DAD, DLS and MALDI-TOF a synergic effect of the coexistence of two salivary-PRP fractions (basic-PRPs and acidic PRPs) on the interaction with flavanols. Results obtained showed noticeable enhancement of the interaction between (epi) catechin and PRPs when both types of proteins are blended. Up to 30 soluble aggregates have been tentatively identified with molecular weight from 4680 to 35,851. (epi) Catechins seem to bind preferentially bPRPs than aPRPs, although the medium size aggregates flavanol-bPRPs formed could favour the interaction with aPRPs giving rise to soluble mixed aggregates.

AB Tucuma (Astrocaryum vulgare) and peach palm (Bactris gasipaes) are Amazonian fruits with high potential to be used as source of carotenoids due to the remarkable yellow-orange colour of their pulp and peel. In this study, for the first time, both the extraction of carotenoids from the peel of tucuma and peach palm fruits and their carotenoid profile were investigated. The carotenoid contents of the peel of both fruits were higher than those found in the pulp. The highest yield of carotenoids from both fruit peels were obtained at the solid-liquid ratio of 1:7 (w/v), 80 min of shaking and by adding 30% of ethyl acetate in acetone, being beta-carotene the major carotenoid (7.8 and 7.3 mg/100 g for tucuma and peach palm, respectively), followed by gamma-carotene and delta-carotene. Thus, peels of tucuma and peach palm fruits were classified as very high carotenoid sources to be used by any potential interested industry.

AB Fucoidan is a sulphated polysaccharide, made up mainly of L-fucose, which is found in brown seaweeds. Its chemical structure is diverse and depends on maturity, species and geographical location. The objective of this study was to elucidate the chemical structure of fucoidan from Cladosiphon okamuranus harvested in Japan. The fucoidan was subject to purification prior to monosaccharide profiling, sulphate content determination, and linkage analysis. Our results showed that Japanese Cladosiphon okamuranus fucoidan contained 70.13 +/- 0.22 wt % fucose and 15.16 +/- 1.17 wt% sulphate. Other minor monosaccharides found were D-xylose, D-galactose, D-mannose, D-glucose, D-arabinose, D-rhamnose and D-glucuronic acid. Linkage analysis revealed that fucopyranoside units along the backbone are linked, through alpha-1,3-glycosidic bonds, with fucose branching at C-2, and one sulphate group at C-4 per every three fucose units, i.e. the structure of fucoidan from Japanese Cladosiphon okamuranus is [-> 3)-alpha-fuc(1 ->](0.52)[-> 3)-alpha-fuc-4-OSO3-(1 ->](0.33)[-> 2)-alpha-fuc](0.14).

AB Enhancement of the diffuse solar radiation to which lettuce plants were exposed clearly affected the vitamin C content and the quantitative and qualitative patterns of phenolic compounds and free amino acids (AA) in the leaves. Although the enhanced level of diffuse light was detrimental to the contents of vitamin C and total phenolic compounds, lowering them by 10-46% and 8-11%, respectively, the content of di-caffeoyltartaric acid increased from 0.26 +/- 0.19 to 0.52 +/- 0.10 mu mol 100 g(-1) f.w. for plants harvested in summer. The effect of diffuse light on AA depended on the total amount of global radiation incident on the plants. Considering the lowest amount of global radiation, the enhanced diffuse light increased the AA content from 766 +/- 89 to 849 +/- 90 mu mol 100 g(-1) f.w. By contrast, under the highest level of global radiation, diffuse light decreased the amount of AA from 990 +/- 16 to 830 +/- 76 mu mol 100 g(-1) f.w.

AB Black rice bran (BRB) was fermented in solid state using Aspergillus awamori and Aspergillus oryzae for 5 days at 30 degrees C, and then the alcoholic extracts of the fermented BRB were examined in terms of phenolic acid composition and antioxidant activity (DPPH radical scavenging and tyrosinase inhibitory activity). A pre-treatment, moisturizing and autoclaving prior to the fermentation, decreased total phenolic content (TPC) by decomposing the anthocyanin in BRB, but the fermentation increased TPC. Protocatechuic acid and ferulic acid showed the most significant increases, reaching their maximum values by the fermentation for 3 days: 1660.6 mu g/g for the extract of BRB fermented by A. awamori. The radical scavenging activity and tyrosinase inhibitory activity of the alcoholic extracts increased by the pre-treatment and fermentation, in accordance with the increase in phenolic acid content. The solid-state fermentation was an effective process to raise the phenolic acid content and antioxidant activity of the extract.

AB Green Robusta beans were subjected to pre-treatment with the aim of reducing the perceived aroma difference between Arabica and Robusta coffee. Treatment was a short soaking procedure with varying concentrations of acetic acid (up to 5%). Samples were subjected to thermal treatment (roasted) and ground to a standardised particle size distribution. Aroma compounds were evaluated by headspace analysis using solid-phase micro-extraction and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Pre-treatment significantly affected aroma formation during roasting and resulted in a modified level of pyrazines, furanic compounds and sulfur-containing compounds (p < 0.05). Principal component analysis illustrated that the aroma profile of the pre-treated Robusta coffee was closer to the target Arabica coffee after roasting. Sensory results confirmed that the aroma of the 2% acetic acid pre-treated Robusta brew was similar to Arabica; the maximum inclusion level of Robusta coffee in a blend could be increased from 20% to 80%.

AB Wine lees are rich in anthocyanins (AC), natural colorants with health promoting properties. The extraction kinetics of AC from different wine lees in conventional solid-liquid extraction were studied for the first time. The influence of parameters such as temperature, solid-liquid ratio (RS-L) and type of solvent (hydro-alcoholic mixtures) was also studied. Furthermore, microwaves (MW) and ultrasounds (US) were used as pre-treatments (a prior step to the conventional extraction) in order to increase AC yield. Maximum extraction yield (2.78 mg(MALVIDIN-EQUIVALENTS)/g(DRY-LEES)) was achieved after 15 min at 25 degrees C, with a RS-L of 1/10 (g/mL) and with a 50%vol. ethanol mixture. When MW were used AC extraction yield was doubled (6.20 mg(MALVIDIN-EQUIVALENTS)/g(DRY-LEES)) and the required time to achieve a constant yield was reduced (from 15 min to 90 s). Meanwhile, US only shortened extraction time in less proportion (from 15 to 5 min). Putative identification of main extract compounds was performed by LC/MS-MS.

AB Since January 2018, insects have been recognised as novel foods in the EU, but their nutritional value varies, and factors affecting their nutritional composition have been debated. We investigated the effect of sex on the nutritional value and chemical composition of the house cricket (Acheta domestica L.). Both sexes were rich in protein and lipids. The proximate composition was partly influenced by sex; females contained a significantly higher amount of lipids (18.3-21.7 vs 12.9-16.1 g/100 g dry matter, p = 0.0001) and fewer proteins than males (61.2-64.9 vs 66.3-69.6 g/100 g dry matter, p = 0.0001). Males contained more chitin (p = 0.0015) and nitrogen chains (p = 0.0003) than females. Only the ash (p = 0.4314) and nitrogen-free extract (p = 0.4871) were uninfluenced by sex. Furthermore, nutrient quality expressed as essential amino acid (72.3-77.1), thrombogenicity (1.22-1.45), and atherogenicity indices (0.53-0.58) did not differ between sexes (p > 0.05).

AB The quantification of species in commercial products is limited by analytical shortcomings, as most of them provide semiquantitative results. An exception is real-time PCR, which can provide quantitative results using hybridization probes. In the present work, this technique has been applied to the absolute, absolute-relative and relative quantification of the most valued hake species in European markets, Merluccius merluccius (European Hake). The best quantification results for this species in binary mixtures with non-target species (Merluccius capensis) and using a species-specific real-time PCR MMER_VIC system was achieved using a relative quantification approach (MLL as reference system). Absolute quantification using the MLL nuclear system has been demonstrated as appropriate for the quantification of the Merluccius genus in food model samples. This study reveals the impact of different reference systems (MLL and HAKE) in the absolute-relative and relative quantification approaches, showing that the nuclear MLL system performed better than the mitochondrial HAKE system.

AB The effect of guar gum (GG) on the physicochemical properties and digestibility of lotus seed starch (LS) subjected to autoclaving-cooling were investigated. Compared to LS alone, LS with 0.03% or 0.15% GG displayed higher crystallinity and short-range order, resulting in the formation of a denser crystal structure. It might contribute to the reduced swelling power, final viscosity, and setback viscosity for those complexes. Coating effect and hydrophilicity were more apparent in LS containing 0.30%, 0.60%, or 0.90% GG, which weakened their crystal structure and increased swelling power, final viscosity, and setback viscosity. The addition of GG delayed starch digestion in vitro, decreased the content of rapidly digestible starch, and increased the content of resistant starch, especially when 0.30% GG was added to 30% LS. The changes in crystal structure and viscosity partially explained the reduced digestibility.

AB This paper reports a unified sample preparation approach for high-throughput multi-residue analysis of veterinary drugs and pesticides in a single sub-sample of bovine milk. The sample (5 g) was deproteinized with acetonitrile before an aliquot (I) was withdrawn, and the remainder was phase-separated using MgSO4 and NaCl. The acetonitrile layer (II) was recovered and the extracts combined, cleaned, and solvent-exchanged before the concentrations of veterinary drugs and pesticides were measured by ultra-fast liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UFLC-MS/MS). As a unique approach, extract II was analyzed simultaneously using gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS). Method performance for 78 drugs and 238 pesticides complied with CD 2002/657/EC and SANTE/11813/2017 guidelines, respectively, with significant savings in time and cost. Thus, it would be ideal for regulatory analysis of analytes ranging from non-polar organochlorine pesticides to polar drugs, including penicillins, quinolones, and tetracyclines.

AB This study aims to develop an intelligent indicating film based on biodegradable polymers incorporated with roselle anthocyanins to monitor pork freshness. Three different films were prepared by using two substances of starch, polyvinyl alcohol and chitosan. The UV-vis spectra and color of anthocyanins changed at pH 2-12. SEM photographs showed that the compatibility of films was improved with the addition of anthocyanins. Furthermore, the polyvinyl alcohol/chitosan/roselle anthocyanins film had the highest tensile strength (98.28 MPa). The starch/polyvinyl alcohol/roselle anthocyanins film had the highest antioxidant activity (524.07%) and the best color stability. The starch/polyvinyl alcohol/roselle anthocyanins film showed visible changes from red to green when employed to monitor the freshness of pork stored at 25 degrees C, before the TVB-N value of the pork gradually increased to the rejection limit (15 mg/100 g) at 36 h. Therefore, the indicator film can be used to monitor pork freshness for intelligent packaging.

AB Withering is an indispensable process for improving flavors in green, black and white teas during their manufacturing. The effects of the withering process on the formation of tea flavors were investigated using transcriptome and metabolite profiling in withered tea leaves. A total of 3268, 23,282 and 25,185 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified at 3 h (68%, water content), 12 h (61%) and 24 h (48%) of the withering process, respectively. The DEGs, involved in flavonoid biosynthesis were significantly downregulated, which could be correlated with the reduction of catechins. Enhancement of terpenoids and alpha-linolenic acid metabolism could trigger an increase in the total content and number of volatiles. The increase in free amino acid-content could be related to 261 DEGs. Our study suggests that dehydration stress during withering induced significant changes in the gene transcription and content of the tea flavor compounds, which promoted the special flavors in various teas.

AB With the purpose of modulating the copigmentation equilibria of red wines, an environmentally sustainable process was performed based on post-fermentative addition of overripe seeds (OS). Simple (SW) and double (DW) addition were performed to produce different enrichment of phenolics from seeds, hence different copigmentation/polymerization ratios.
   The determination of the phenolic composition showed different global increases in OS-macerates wines (catechin, epicatechin, gallic acid and procyanidins B1 and B2). The double post-maceration (DW) was more effective than the simple post-maceration addition to improve the phenolic structure of wines.
   The application of Differential Tristimulus Colorimetry could assess the effects of this practice on the color characteristics and stability of wines. Results highlighted that both simple and double assays underwent colorimetric improvements against the control wines (CW, no seeds addition). DW led to the highest chromatic stability, showing lower lightness, higher chroma values and bluish hues than CW. This color difference was visually detectable.

AB Detailed investigations on the physicochemical and structural characterization of chlorophyll loaded microcapsules and their storage stability have not previously been conducted. Therefore, our objective was to encapsulate unstable chlorophylls using different blends of gum Arabic (GA) and maltodextrin (MD) (GA-MD ratios of 5: 5, 3: 7, and 0: 10) by spray-drying to improve storage stability of chlorophylls. An increase in concentration of MD in wall materials was associated with lower moisture content (0.56%), higher encapsulation efficiency (77.19%), chlorophyll content (46.78 mu g/g dry powder), degree of crystallinity, and thermal stability of microcapsules. Furthermore, FTIR, XRD, and DSC analyses confirmed inclusion of chlorophylls within microcapsules. The entrapment of chlorophylls within microcapsules enhanced their storage stability at all temperatures (4, 20, and 40 degrees C) for ten days; notably, microcapsules coated with MD alone showed the highest storage stability (94.7-97.5%). In conclusion, microencapsulation of chlorophylls using MD alone was optimal for enhancing chlorophylls' storage stability.

AB An ultra performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method was developed for the determination of serotonin in raw and roasted nuts (almond, Brazil nut, cashew, chestnut, coconut, hazelnut, Macadamia nut, pecan, peanut, pine nut, pistachio and walnut) as well as nut products (nut containing snack bars, chocolate and spreads) for the first time. Water extraction without prior defatting was performed to leach serotonin from complex matrices of nuts. Mean recoveries ranged from 64.2 +/- 9.6 to 94.7 +/- 20.1%. Limit of detection and limit of quantification were between 0.4 and 2.3 and 1.0-7.4 ng/g, respectively. Repeatability and reproducibility values were below 2%. Serotonin content of nuts ranged from 0.05 +/- 0.01 (pine nut) to 155 +/- 57.0 mu g/g (walnut) in raw nuts while it was between 0.03 +/- 0.00 (Macadamia nut) and 15.3 +/- 1.27 mu g/g (pecan) in roasted nuts. Serotonin in nut products was found to range from 0.09 +/- 0.00 to 8.99 +/- 0.92 mu g/g, depending on the nuts they contain.

AB This research was the first to demonstrate the variations of nutritional constituents, glucosidase properties and antioxidant activities in soybeans during different solid state fermentation times (germination -> 5 periods for 12 days) with Tricholoma matsutake. Total isoflavones were significantly reduced (2661.54 -> 1559.04 mu g/g) with the increase of aglycone contents (107.61 -> 1285.66 mu g/g, 12 times) for fermentation, whereas amino acid and fatty acid slightly increased. Among them, daidzein (43.2 -> 43.6 -> 421.9 -> 721.4 -> 634.0 mu g/g), genistein (52.7 -> 24.4 -> 339.5 -> 546.6 -> 512.8 mu g/g) and glutamic acid (0.3 -> 1.7 -> 3.9 -> 6.6 -> 16.1 mg/g) markedly increased between germinated and fermented soybeans. Total phenolic contents and antioxidant abilities also considerably increased, especially, ABTS displayed the predominant scavenging capacities (33.1 -> 94.8%) at 200 mu g/ml, followed by DPPH (11.9 -> 87.0%) and hydroxyl (11.2 -> 49.2%) radicals. Interestingly, alpha-glucosidase inhibition (11.8 -> 84.9%) and beta-glucosidase (3.1 -> 40.3 unit/g) exhibited the highest activities after 9 days. Our results implied that fermented soybeans may be contributed to enhance the soybean value in nutrition and biological effect aspects to development of new functional foods.

AB Recently body fluids have been found to contain a class of nanoparticles released from cells, referred to as extracellular vesicles; exosomes are a type of small-diameter extracellular vesicle. We selected three types of sample: milk-derived exosomes, adipose-derived stem cell exosomes, and nanoparticles extracted from coconut water, to investigate their morphology, particle size distribution, protein content, and microRNA expression levels. Among the vesicles investigated, coconut nanoparticles had the greatest size distribution, and the protein content of coconut nanoparticles differed from that of mammalian exosomes. Using fluorescence microscopy, we determined that DiI-labeled extracellular vesicles could be absorbed by bacteria. Prominently, milk-derived exosomes could promote the growth of Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 and Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1. The studied extracellular vesicles could alter bacterial gene expression. Overall, this study identified differences in exogenous extracellular vesicles from different sources and revealed their supportive effects on microbial growth to make better utilization of microbial resources.

AB The extraction of polyhydroxylated naphthoquinone (PHNQ) pigments from the shell and spines of the New Zealand sea urchin Evechinus chloroticus was evaluated using six different macroporous resins as an alternative to using organic solvent extraction alone. Four of the resins evaluated in this study (D4006, D4020, D101 and NKA-9) provided the best extraction of PHNQ pigments in terms of the overall adsorption and desorption of E. chloroticus PHNQ pigments from the resins. Organic solvents alone had a higher yield of PHNQs than the resins. The PHNQ composition was characterised by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with diode-array detection and mass spectrometry. Five PHNQ compounds (spinochromes E, B, C, A and echinochrome A), and three aminated PHNQ compounds (spinamine E, echinamines A and B) were identified. The pigments were found to be prone to degradation on exposure to light, with the aminated PHNQ pigments being the least stable.

AB The action of beta-glucosidase and protease of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens SWJS22 in the fermentation of soybean meal caused a significant increase 1): in total phenolic and flavonoid contents with two-fold or higher, largely associated with daidzein, glycitein, genistein, protocatechuic, and p-hydroxybenzoic, gallic acids; 2): the amount of peptides < 3 kDa, maillard reaction intermediate and maillard reaction product with five-, three- and twenty-one-fold, respectively. The significant increase in the amount of antioxidant components in the lyophilised fermented soybean meal supernatant (LFSMS) was associated with the improved antioxidant activity. Namely, the DPPH radical scavenging activity, reducing power, and oxygen radical absorbance capacity of the LFSMS generally increased, and LFSMS (at doses > 250 mg/kg body weight) improved the activities of superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, catalase and total antioxidant capacity, and inhibited the formation of malondialdehyde in mouse serum and liver (p < 0.05). Therefore, LFSMS could be used as functional food ingredients.

AB This study was performed to examine the stability of retinol contained within oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions under UV and during storage at different temperatures. O/W emulsions were prepared using different emulsifiers and oil concentrations. The stability of the retinol contained in the O/W emulsions was investigated by measuring the percentage of residual retinol in the samples after UV exposure and storage at different temperatures (4, 25, and 40 degrees C). The oil concentration of the emulsion had a greater impact on UV stability than the type of emulsifier used, whereas the storage stability at different temperatures was affected by both the choice of emulsifier and the oil concentration. The storage stability of the retinol contained in the O/W emulsions may be related to the lipid oxidation properties of the emulsions rather than the latter's physical stability. Experiments with EDTA and different oil types were performed to confirm this theory.

AB The relatively new technique, desorption corona beam ionization (DCBI), was coupled with an ion-trap mass spectrometer for the rapid detection of 10 antimicrobials in animal-derived food. Under positive ion mode, 10 common antimicrobials were identified without prior sample preparation. With simple pre-treatment, semi-quantification based on peak area was achieved. There was a good correlation (R-2 > 0.99) in the rational linear ranges (1-3 orders of magnitude) for all 10 target analytes. Compared with a conventional liquid chromatographic method, the DCBI-MS method was highly sensitive; e.g., roxithromycin was detected at 0.02 mu g/g, whereas the value was 0.2 mg/kg in the European Union Commission Regulation (No 37/2010) and 0.3 mu g/mL in a recently reported LC method. The proposed method allowed for the simple, rapid, sensitive and specific detection of antimicrobials in animal-derived foods. Our approach could be used for other atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) related ambient mass spectrometry methods to detect other compounds.

AB The aim of this study was to identify phenolic compounds and measure the physicochemical properties of two pistachio (Pistacia vera L.) cultivars ('Uzun' and 'Ohadi'). For this purpose, the pistachios were subjected to four different hulling methods (wet hulling-WT, brine hulling-BR, wet-dry hulling-WD, and dry-dry hulling-DD) and a standard roasting treatment. Phenolic compounds were analyzed by HPLC-DAD-ESI-MSn. Twelve phenolics were identified and quantified in the samples, 10 of which were flavonoid and two non-flavonoid phenolic acids. In both cultivars, the major compounds were found to be gallic acid and catechin followed by eriodictyol-7-O-glucoside and eriodictyol. The dry-dry hulling method treated sample had higher antioxidant capacity, total phenol content, and phenolic compounds than the other hulling methods in both pistachio cultivars. After the roasting treatment, the antioxidant capacity, phenolic content, and a* value increased while the L* and b* values decreased.

AB A simple QuEChERS method coupled with ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) was developed to improve the extraction efficiency of lipophilic marine toxins (yessotoxins, dinophysistoxins, okadaic acid, azazspiracids, and spirolides) in fresh and processed shellfish products. The proposed method included freezing and dispersive solid-phase extraction with graphene oxide as the sorbent to clean complex matrices containing lipids (e.g., free fatty acids) and pigments. Quantification was performed using matrix-matched calibration curves. Recoveries were 85%-117.4% and the relative standard deviation for precision was less than 10% for marine toxins in fresh and processed shellfish products. The limits of detection (signal-to-noise = 3) and quantification (signal-to-noise = 10) were 0.10-1.47 and 0.32-4.92 mu g/kg, respectively. The validated QuEChERS method, coupled with UPLC-MS/MS, was applied successfully to determine lipophilic marine toxins in fresh and processed shellfish samples.

AB The aim of this review is to describe the volatile aroma compounds of green coffee beans and evaluate sources of variation in the formation and development of coffee aroma through postharvest processing. The findings of this survey showed that the volatile constituents of green coffee beans (e.g., alcohols, aldehydes, and alkanes) have no significant influence on the final coffee aroma composition, as only a few such compounds remain in the beans after roasting. On the other hand, microbial-derived, odor-active compounds produced during removal of the fruit mucilage layer, including esters, higher alcohols, aldehydes, and ketones, can be detected in the final coffee product. Many postharvest processing including drying and storage processes could influence the levels of coffee aroma compositions, which remain to be elucidated. Better understanding of the effect of these processes on coffee aroma composition would assist coffee producers in the optimal selection of postharvest parameters that favor the consistent production of flavorful coffee beans.

AB This study follows recent attempts to discover natural xanthine oxidase (XO) inhibitors from foods, focusing herein on under-researched fish proteins. The anti-hyperuricemic function of tuna flesh hydrolysate (TPH) produced using Alcalase 2.4L was confirmed in potassium oxonate-induced hyperuricemic rats. TPH was separated using 80 wt% aqueous ethanol. The ethanol-soluble fraction (ESF) abundant in small peptides (< 1000 Da) afforded the highest XO inhibition. Separation of ESF by Sephadex G-15 and UPLC/MS/MS revealed 13 di-/tri-peptides (12 are newly identified XO inhibitors). Their XO inhibitory activities were assessed using corresponding synthetic peptides via an improved HPLC method. Results indicate that Phe-containing peptides were more potent XO inhibitors than Trp-containing peptides, with Phe-His having the highest XO inhibitory activity (IC50 = 25.7 mM). Molecular docking studies revealed the importance of two hydrogen bonds and one pi-pi stacking interaction with Phe-914 in XO for XO-peptide inhibitor binding. Phe-containing di-/tripeptides could be potent XO inhibitors against hyperuricemia.

AB This study analyzed the volatile composition and aroma profile of BRS Carmem and BRS Violeta red wines elaborated from traditional and two alternative winemaking procedures: grape pre-drying and submerged cap. The wines contained higher concentration of acetates (ranging from 303 mg L-1 to 905 mg L-1) and ethyl and methyl esters (ranging from 138 mg L-1 to 415 mg L-1). The BRS Carmem wines were described as fruity due to the higher concentration of esters and BRS Violeta wines were described as vegetal mainly due to the higher concentration of terpenes and methoxyphenols. C6 alcohols also influenced the vegetal notes of BRS Violeta wines from traditional and submerged cap procedures and the pre-dried wines also presented a relevant jam note possibly due to the presence of 2-phenylethyl acetate. The changes in winemaking procedures can possibly lead to changes in the aromatic profile of red wines in a positive way, improving the wine aroma quality.

AB Blended sunflower (SO) (50-80%) and sesame oils (SEO) (20-50%) were evaluated for thermo-oxidative stability (induction period, IP), oxidation kinetics (rate constant, k), synergy and shelf-life (25 degrees C) (IP25) using Rancimat (100, 110, 120, and 130 degrees C). The Arrhenius equation (ln k vs. 1/T) and activated complex theory (ln k/T vs. 1/T) were used to estimate activation energies, activation enthalpies and entropies, which varied from 92.05 to 99.17 kJ/mol, 88.83 to 95.94 kJ/mol, - 35.58 to - 4.81 J/mol K, respectively (R-2 > 0.90, p < 0.05). Oil blend (OB) with 1:1 SO to SEO exhibited greatest synergy (115%), highest IP (100 degrees C) (13.2 vs. 6.1 h) and most extended IP25 (193 vs. 110 days) with a nutritionally stable composition of omega-fatty acids (omega 9, 34.5 vs. 28.7%;omega 6, 49 vs. 52%) compared with SO. Better retention of lignans (6205 vs. 3951 mg/kg) and tocopherols (332 vs. 189 mg/kg) were also noted in OB compared with SO alone.

AB The ability of electrostatic complexes made up of sodium caseinate (NaCAS) and a polysaccharide, carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) or gum Arabic (GA), to retain polyphenols from grape seed extract when encapsulated in W-1/O/W-2 emulsions was compared to that of the single NaCAS (1%). Both electrostatic complexes (0.5% NaCAS - 0.375% CMC and 0.5% NaCAS - 0.5% GA at pH 5.6) used as hydrophilic emulsifiers in W-1/O/W-2 were able to stabilize the O/W-2 interface for 14 days, even though their protein content was reduced by a 50% regarding that of the emulsions only stabilized with NaCAS. Moreover, interfacial adsorption did not show significant differences between NaCAS-polysaccharide electrostatic complexes and the single NaCAS. In terms of interfacial barrier properties, the rate of polyphenol release during storage was not affected by the type of hydrophilic emulsifier. Since polyphenol transport in W-1/O/W-2 emulsions was diffusion controlled, interfacial adsorption was considered the main factor limiting polyphenol retention.

AB H-1 NMR spectroscopy combined with chemometrics was employed to discriminate lager beer samples from two different classes, according to their style and information provided on the label. Partial replacement of barley malt by adjuncts is a common practice adopted by large breweries, which can lead to a decrease in diastatic power, requiring the use of exogenous enzymes. For this reason, small variations in the spectral profile can occur in the carbohydrates region. Many studies have focused on differentiating beers according to type and brewing process. However, there have no studies concerning the discrimination of beers of the same type that differ only in style, using H-1 NMR spectroscopy. In this study PCA (first three components explained 81.5% of the dataset variability), PLS-DA and SIMCA models proved to be powerful tool with predict power higher than 90% for distinguishing lager beers based on the raw materials employed in the brewing process.

AB Bioactivities and numerous health benefits against a number of oxidative stress related diseases have been attributed to the role of dietary antioxidants. The development of physical (spray drying, lyophilization, super-critical fluid precipitation and solvent evaporation), physico-chemical (coacervation, liposomes and ionic gelation) and chemical encapsulation techniques (interfacial polymerization and molecular inclusion complexation) enable to obtain healthier and acceptable bioactive compounds. This review focuses on the impacts of microencapsulation techniques on the encapsulation characteristics of food antioxidants. Additionally, this study also provides detailed information on the principles, effective parameters, advantages, disadvantages and applications of microencapsulation techniques.

AB The potential of using the near-infrared (NIR) and Fourier transform mid-infrared (ATR-FT/MIR) spectroscopy for the determination of intestinal crude protein (CP) digestibility (IPD) of wheat was evaluated. For CP, the best NIR model showed an excellent prediction performance (R-2 = 0.98); the best MIR model also gave an excellent prediction performance (R-2 = 0.96). Regarding to IPD, the best model obtained by NIR technique showed approximate quantitative predictive ability (R-2 = 0.68), and the best model generated by MIR technique obtained similar prediction performance (R-2 = 0.67). NIR models generally showed better predictive abilities than MIR models, which may be due to the MIR spectra record fundamental molecular vibrations and can be more easily affected by multiple interferences. The amide I and II bands played important roles in the development of PLS models for CP and IPD. Results from this study demonstrated the potential of using IR spectroscopy for the prediction of nutrient digestibility while more efforts are required to improve the performance of NIR and ATR-FT/MIR spectroscopy in predicting the IPD of wheat.

AB This study examined the influence of consumer behavior on furan, 2-methylfuran, 3-methylfuran, 2,5-dimethylfuran and 2,3-dimethylfuran exposure in coffee. Coffees brewed using a filter, fully automatic, capsule machine or reconstituted instant coffee were found to have a significant different cup concentrations of furan derivatives. Coffee brewed with the fully automatic machine contained the highest furan and furan derivative concentrations (99.05 mu g/L furan, 263.91 mu g/L 2-methylfuran, 13.15 mu g/L 3-methylfuran and 8.44 mu g/L 2,5-dimethylfuran) whereas soluble coffee did not contain detectable levels, thereby contributing least to a consumer's dietary exposure. Furan and furan derivative concentrations were found to decrease significantly upon cooling, reducing consumer exposure by 8.0-17.2 % on average once the coffee reached drinking temperature 55-60 degrees C, in ceramic cups. Serving coffee in a ceramic or disposable cup were found to influence the cooling dynamics of the coffee but did not statistically influence the consumers exposure at a given temperature.

AB In this study, wheat starch, A- and B-type starch granules were firstly treated with citric acid (CT) and then subjected to heat-moisture treatment (HMT). The maximum thermo-stable resistant starch (RS) contents reached 71.52%, 71.27%, 71.58% for CT-HMT wheat starch, A- and B-type starch granules, respectively. The hydrolysis kinetic parameters (C-infinity and k) reduced after CT-HMT. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) results revealed that the endothermic and crystalline peaks of CT-HMT starch samples disappeared. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) results showed that more collapses and destructiveness appeared on the surfaces of CT-HMT starch granules. The esterification reaction became stronger during HMT according to Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy analysis, which was consistent with the results of degree of substitution. Raman spectroscopy presented similar structural properties results with XRD and FT-IR. These results suggest that CT prior to HMT is a useful method for preparing high amount of thermally stable RS.

AB Glycine betaine (GB) treatment is useful to reduce chilling injury (CI) of several kinds of fruits including peach. However, the regulatory mechanism remains unknown. In this study, peach fruit was treated with 10 mmol L-1 GB solution for 10 min. The effects of GB treatment on CI, phenolic and soluble sugar metabolism were investigated in this study. Moreover, phenylpropanoid and soluble sugar content, and enzyme activities associated with phenolic and sugar metabolisms were also measured. The results showed that GB reduced CI and maintained high levels of total phenolic and flavonoid content. The activities of phenylpropanoid metabolism-related enzymes were significantly enhanced by GB. Higher content of sucrose and lower contents of fructose and glucose were observed in GB-treated fruits. Therefore, our results showed that GB could enhance chilling tolerance of peach through regulating phenolic and sugar metabolisms, and maintaining high levels of individual phenolic and sucrose content.

AB In present study, the content of main nutrients in wild coix seed were significantly higher than cultivated coix seed. Transcriptome and proteome were combined to provide new insight of the molecular mechanisms linked to nutritional quality of wild coix seed and cultivated coix seed by RNA sequencing and isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification techniques. A total of 20,039 genes and 471 proteins exhibited differential expression level in cultivated coix seed when compared with wild coix seed. These genes and proteins revealed that the pathway of flavonoids biosynthesis, starch and sucrose metabolism, lipid metabolism and amino acid metabolism were linked to nutritional quality of coix seed. Our results provided transcriptomics and proteomics information with respect to the molecular mechanisms of nutritional changes of coix seed, identified key genes and proteins that associated with the metabolism and accumulation of nutrients, and helped clarify the mechanisms of nutrient differences.

AB A sensitive gas chromatographic method using a modified QuEChERS technique is reported for simultaneous determination, dissipation and risk assessment of fipronil and its metabolites in sugarcane and soil. Recoveries were 80.7-98.5% with precision within 1.4-16.5% estimated at the limits of detection (LOD) 0.0015-0.002 mu g g(-1) and limits of quantification (LOQ) 0.005 mu g g(-1). Fipronil dissipated with half-life (T-1/2) of 2.8-4.3 days while for total fipronil it was 3.7-6.0 days following application of fipronil (5% SC) in sugarcane fields at recommended (100 g a.i. ha(-1)) and double the recommended (200 g a.i. ha(-1)) doses. Estimated pre-harvest intervals (PHI) for fipronil were 20.3-27.0 days in sugarcane plants, and for total fipronil the corresponding values were 28.2-37.8 days. No dietary risk was observed due to fipronil (RQ(d) < 1) 5 days after application. Potential risk exists towards algae and soil macro-organism (RQs > 1), but for earthworms it was safe (RQs < 1).

AB Incorporation of many water-insoluble nutraceuticals into aqueous formulations can present a real challenge for food industry. Hence, establishment of novel technologies for concurrent extraction and solubilisation of lipophilic compounds might be of a great interest. The main objective of the present study was to prepare olive oil microemulsions using different proportions of lecithin, 1-propanol, olive oil and water to examine their abilities to form microemulsion as well as extraction of lycopene from industrial tomato pomace. Lycopene extraction using 1 g tomato pomace and 4 extraction cycles applying 5 g microemulsion composed of lecithin: 1-propanol: olive oil: water (53.33:26.67:10:10 wt%) resulted in the highest extraction efficiency (88%). Such biocompatible and food-grade microemulsion containing lycopene can be applied in many food formulations where it can present a good solubility in aqueous and non-polar media and can improve the health-promoting properties of both lycopene and olive oil.

AB The aim of this study was to predict the geographical origin of acacia honey of China through analysis of physicochemical parameters combination with chemometrics. Samples from six different origins were investigated on parameters of delta C-13 value, oligosaccharides and polyphenols, using EA-IRMS/LC-IRMS, GC-MS and HPLC-MS, respectively. The results indicated that the delta C-13 value of honey from Gansu region were lower than those of other regions. Oligosaccharides of honey from Shanxi and Shaanxi regions were both higher than other four regions. Polyphenols of honey from Shandong region was the highest and were better parameters than both delta C-13 and oligosaccharides in discrimination of geographical origins. Partial Least Square Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) showed that when all 31 different parameters were combined, a correct classification rate of 94.12% could be achieved using external cross validation method. In conclusion, the method in discrimination of geographical can be used to provide reliable and useful reference information.

AB beta-Agarase was immobilized by using tannic acid modified-Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles (TA-MNPs) as a support material. The MNPs were synthesized by improved chemical coprecipitation method and modified with TA for agarase immobilization. TA-MNPs and immobilized beta-agarase were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), all of which indicated the successful surface modification of MNPs with TA and the immobilization of beta-agarase. The optimal immobilization conditions for 25 mg TA-MNPs included 100 r/min oscillation speed, immobilization time of 2 h, immobilization temperature of 15 degrees C, and initial beta-agarase concentration of 3 mL (480 U). Immobilized beta-agarase showed better pH and thermal stability and excellent reusability than the free enzyme. Results revealed the promising application of beta-agarase-TA-MNPs for the preparation of neoagaro-oligosaccharides with different average polymerization degrees and varying activities in the antioxidant.

AB Novel amphiphilic antioxidant, (+)-catechin-beta-sitosterol (CS), was designed and successfully prepared with integration of (+)-catechin and beta-sitosterol through the linkage of succinic acid. Sequential esterification was carried out to connect (+)-catechin and beta-sitosterol. The identity of CS was confirmed by NMR, IR and MS spectroscopies. DSC analysis revealed that Delta H of CS was much lower than those of (+)-catechin and beta-sitosterol, indicating ameliorated crystallinity. The logP measurement demonstrated significantly increased lipophilicity. Then excellent antioxidant activities of the novel antioxidant in typical polyunsaturated lipid O/W and W/O emulsions were unveiled applying beta-sitosterol bleaching assay and 5-dodecanoylaminofluorescein (DAF) fluorescent probe method. The antioxidative behavior of CS in emulsion was beyond the polar paradox hypothesis and could be rationalized by effective accumulation at oil/water interface owing to its amphiphilic nature. This study offers a promising solution for development of naturally derived amphiphilic antioxidants for lipid-based systems.

AB In this study, glazing with water and rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) extract were applied on frozen mud shrimp (Solenocera melantho) and stored at -20 degrees C for 24 weeks. Quality loss and protein and lipid changes of shrimp were evaluated by total volatile basis nitrogen (TVB-N), drip loss, moisture distribution, sulfhydryl content (SH), disulfide bond, intrinsic fluorescence intensity, lipid content, free fatty acids (FFA), peroxide value (PV), fluorescent compounds and sensory characteristics. Results showed that unglazed mud shrimp exhibited significant quality decline after 16 weeks of frozen storage. Glazing treatment significantly reduced quality loss, protein degradation, and lipid oxidative damage of shrimp during the 24 weeks of frozen storage, compared to the unglazed control sample. Glazing with rosemary extract was more effective in controlling quality changes in frozen mud shrimp with lower TVB-N, drip loss, PV, FFA and higher lipid content and sensory scores.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of protein S-nitrosylation on the glycogen metabolism in postmortem pork. The pork samples were incubated with control (0.9% NaCl), nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor, or NO donor for 4 and 12 h at 4 degrees C. Results indicate that NOS inhibitor treatment led to significantly lower level of glycogen and higher lactate content at 24 h compared those of control and NO donor treatments (P < 0.05). The pH of NOS inhibitor treatment was significantly lower than other treatments, which indicates the fast glycolysis during postmortem aging (P < 0.05). In addition, the activities of glycolytic enzymes including GP, GAPDH and PK were significantly different among three treatments (P < 0.05) possibly due to the different modification of protein S-nitrosylation. These results suggest that NO could regulate the glycogen metabolism through modulating the activities of glycolytic enzymes by protein S-nitrosylation.

AB The commercial STREAMLINE Direct HST adsorbent was employed to investigate the adsorption characteristics of lysozyme in complex chicken egg white (CEW). The effects of operating parameters, including adsorption pH, ionic strength, and hydrophobicity of liquids on binding capacity, were examined using a well-mixed contactor. To determine the elution strategy, the experiments were carried out in a small packed bed. The lysozyme was completely eluted by 0.5 M NaCl in 40 mM carbonate buffer (pH 12) at a high liquid velocity of 200 cm/h. The effect of rotating speed on fluidization characteristics was further investigated by using a stirred fluidized bed process. Smoother fluidization was observed when the rotating speed reached 200 rpm and lysozyme was directly recovered from highly viscous CEW in a single step with a high yield of 94.3% and a purification factor of 15.7.

AB Medium-chain fatty acids (C-6-C-10, MCFAs) represent valuable molecules for food and pharmaceutical industries. However, MCFAs in Escherichia coli induce stresses and toxicity, reducing final yields. These phenotypes could be alleviated if MCFA export from cells was accelerated, yet information on proteins responsible for exporting MCFAs remains limited. Here, a panel of 17 genes or operons was screened. Overexpressing resistance nodulation cell division family transporter acrE, mdtE and mdtC increased MCFA titer by 46.4%, 65.2% and 33.8%, whereas overexpressing transcriptional activators soxS, marA and multidrug efflux pumps cmr, fadL decreased MCFA titer by 42.5%, 27.8%, 37.6% and 29.5%, respectively. Furthermore, the effect of multiple transporter engineering was investigated. Overexpressing acrE, mdtE and mdtC together with deleting cmr increased MCFA production by more than two-fold. This study demonstrated the efficient efflux pump specifically for MCFAs and this multiple transporter engineering strategy can be employed to synthesize other bio-products toxic to microorganisms.

AB Among spices, Saffron is among the most extensively interrogated for purity and authenticity. Numerous methods have been recommended for authentication of Saffron samples and for detection of adulterants for codex compliance. However, none of these methods can fulfill both of these important quality criteria. This study describes a three step approach to achieving this goal by including the established ISO3632 method and two additional methods based on microscopic examination and DNA barcoding. We provide results showing the utility of these methods both independently and in combination for quality evaluation of 36 commercial saffron samples. Our results show that use of the ISO3632 approach alone can reveal the color and aroma but not the genetic origin of the material or distinguish between synthetic components versus natural ingredients. Also, the microscopic observation method can give a preliminary indication of saffron authenticity, but used alone it is unable to quantify purity. Finally, a relatively new method based on the use of DNA barcodes can authenticate the biological origin of the saffron, but here results may be misleading if auto-adulterating materials are present. Overall, our study reveals that through the combined use of all three methods, saffron authentication can substantially improved.

AB This study investigated the effects of a novel edible coating combining fish gelatin with curcumin/beta-cyclodextrin (CUR/beta CD) emulsion on the quality of grass carp fillets (GCFs) during storage at 4 degrees C. For all samples, the quality parameters, including weight loss, pH, total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N), peroxide value (PV), thiobarbituric acid (TBA) value, SDS-PAGE, free amino acids (FAA), microbiological (total viable counts (TVC), Pseudomonas counts, yeasts and molds, and H2S-producing bacteria), color and sensorial characteristics, were tested periodically. The coatings containing CUR/beta CD emulsions exhibited better preservative effects than gelatin/beta CD coating. Therefore, fish gelatin coating enriched with CUR/beta CD emulsion can be used as an effective way to maintain the quality of GCF and extend its shelf life during storage at 4 degrees C.

AB The adverse health effects of sucrose overconsumption, typical for diets in developed countries, necessitate use of low-calorie sweeteners. Following approval by the European Commission (2011), steviol glycosides are increasingly used as high-intensity sweeteners in food. Stevioside is the most prevalent steviol glycoside in Stevia rebaudiana plant leaves, but it has found limited applications in food products due to its lingering bitterness. Enzymatic glucosylation is a strategy to reduce stevioside bitterness, but reported glucosylation reactions suffer from low productivities. Here we present the optimized and efficient alpha-glucosylation of stevioside using the mutant glucansucrase Gtf180-Delta N-Q1140E and sucrose as donor substrate. Structures of novel products were elucidated by NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and methylation analysis; stevioside was mainly glucosylated at the steviol C-19 glucosyl moiety. Sensory analysis of the alpha-glucosylated stevioside products by a trained panel revealed a significant reduction in bitterness compared to stevioside, resulting in significant improvement of edulcorant/organoleptic properties.

AB A green, fast, and efficient method for synthesizing lipophilic epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) derivatives was set up for the first time. EGCG was lipophilized by esterification in order to promote its application in lipid products and to possibly enhance its bioactivity. A high conversion of EGCG was achieved. Three monoesters of the EGCG derivatives were confirmed by high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, and the predominant one was identified as 4'-O-palmitoyl EGCG by nuclear magnetic resonance. The EGCG derivatives exhibited good radical scavenging capacities. In lard the solubility of EGCG derivatives was enhanced 470 times compared to EGCG, and they exhibited excellent antioxidative activity in the oil. These results indicate that the palmitoylated EGCG derivatives may be used as potent antioxidants in lipophilic medium, such as edible oils and fatty foods. In addition, this method can be applied to commercial application, producing antioxidants to substitute for synthetic ones like tert-butylhydroquinone.

AB Eurotium cristatum, a beneficial fungus isolated from Fuzhuan tea, was used to ferment Angelica dahurica for the first time. The antioxidant capacities of the extracts before and after fermentation were compared using ABTS, DPPH and FRAP assays. The results showed that the antioxidant capacities of the extracts acquired using organic solvents were greater after fermentation. Moreover, based on a comparison of the HPLC chromatograms, the chemical composition of Angelica dahurica changed substantially during fermentation. To further understand the changes in its antioxidant constituents, an on-line HPLC-PDA-Triple-TOF-MS/MS-ABTS system was employed. Twelve antioxidants belonging to three different classes were detected and identified, and their antioxidant capacities were preliminarily evaluated. The results indicated that the substances produced during the fermentation of Eurotium cristatum played important roles in enhancing the antioxidant capacity.

AB Nonenzymatic glycosylation (NEG) can generate advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and its intermediates alpha-dicarbonyl compounds, which contribute to the risk of diabetes. This study investigated the anti-glycation mechanisms and structure-activity relationship of (+)-catechin (CC) and (-)-epicatechin (EC). The results showed that the effect of CC on inhibiting AGEs was significantly better than that of EC (p < 0.05). By exploring the mechanism, we found that there was no significant difference in the ability of CC and EC to capture alpha-dicarbonyl compounds. But CC was found to be more efficient than EC to inhibit RO center dot, center dot OH and center dot CHO radicals generation, which may be the primary reason that CC was more effective than EC on AGEs inhibition. What's more, CC showed better inhibitory effect on beta-glucosidase that was close to the molecular docking study. Our results will provide a theoretical foundation for development of different structure of procyanidins as natural AGEs inhibitors in food and medicine.

AB Anthocyanins are major components of purple sweet potatoes (PSP) with antioxidant, anti-obesity, and antidiabetic activity. In this study, we evaluated the hypoglycemic effects of 12 individual anthocyanins purified from PSP (Korean variety Shinzami). We separated the anthocyanins using liquid chromatography with diode array detection and electrospray ionization/mass spectrometry (LC-DAD-ESI/MS). Three anthocyanins were selected through a radical scavenging activity test. We examined whether individual anthocyanins inhibited glucose secretion in HepG2 cells (hepatic gluconeogenesis). Additionally, we determined the effect of each anthocyanin on fasting blood glucose levels in 6-week-old male C57BL/6J mice fed a 60% high-fat diet for 14 weeks. Mice were evaluated at 0, 1, 2, and 4 h after oral administration of anthocyanins (80 mg/kg), an anthocyanin-rich-fraction (80 mg/kg), positive control (metformin, 80 mg/kg), and distilled water (control). Cyanidin 3-caffeoyl-p-hydroxybenzoylsophoroside-5-glucoside (PEAK9) was the main PSP anthocyanin that inhibited hepatic glucose secretion and reduced blood glucose.

AB The composite films were prepared by mixing rapeseed protein hydrolysate with chitosan. Upon increasing the degree of hydrolysis, rapeseed protein enhanced its compatibility with chitosan, thus making composite films denser. The tensile strength of films was increased from 16.04 to 23.46 MPa with increasing the degree of hydrolysis from 0% to 12%. Moreover, addition of chitosan enhances the mechanical properties of the rapeseed protein films, the alpha-helix content in the secondary structure of the rapeseed protein from 15.4% to 25.0%. And it is hydrogen bonding, the main force between two components that contributed to good compatibility, which supported by analyses of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The results of the antibacterial properties of the composite film with 12% degree of hydrolysis were better compared with the chitosan film. Taken together, our results provide insights for the further application of rapeseed protein in making edible films.

AB Odour-active compounds in three traditional balsamic vinegars from Modena (TB) and seven balsamic vinegars from Modena (PGI) were determined by gas chromatography-olfactometry (GC-O) using frequency of detection methodology (modified frequency, MF, %). The main odour compounds (mean MF > 60%) were 2,3-butane-dione (75%), acetic acid (70%), furan-2-carbaldehyde (62%), 1-(furan-2-yl) ethanone (62%), 2-methylpropanoic acid (66%), butanoic acid (78%), 3-methylbutanoic acid (83%), 2-phenylethyl acetate (65%), 2-hydroxy-3-methylcyclopent-2-en-1-one (61%), 2-phenylethan-1-ol (84%), 3-hydroxy-2-methylpyran-4-one (60%), (5-formylfuran-2-yl) methyl acetate (68%), 2-phenylacetic acid (69%) and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde (86%). All odour impact compounds were grouped into 7 categories according to their aromatic character: cheesy-butter-lactic, sweet, flower, empyreumatic, fruity, chemical and miscellaneous. Balsamic vinegars from Modena showed lower values for the sweet category whereas for the miscellaneous and chemical categories they exhibited higher values than those found in traditional balsamic vinegars from Modena.
   A principal component analysis showed that both types of vinegars from Modena could be clearly differentiated based on olfactometric data.

AB Lactobacillus species are beneficial for the functional food industry and preventive medicine. The complex microflora of traditional cheese depends on the cheese types (e.g., homemade rennets). Here, the abomasum driven rennet was assessed for the existence of lactobacilli. For differentiating lactobacilli, the bacterial suspension was screened for the acid and bile resistance. The isolated bacteria were evaluated for antibiotic susceptibility and antagonistic impacts on other pathogenic bacteria. The 16S rDNA gene was evaluated by the amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA) recruiting the restriction enzyme Taq I and compared to the virtually digested patterns of previous reports on lactobacilli. The isolates were examined by random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and distinctive lactobacilli were sequenced. ARDRA and RAPD data showed three distinct lactobacilli strains, including L. acidophilus, L. planetarum, and L. fermentum. The homemade rennet is proposed as the novel source of probiotic strains as an alternative to the traditional cheeses.

AB In this work the capacity of Opuntia ficus indica mucilage as a wall agent in the microencapsulation of Escontria chiotilla and Stenocereus queretaroensis pulp and skin pigments through a spray drying process was studied. The acidified mucilage was used as an extracting medium for betalains present in the skin of these fruits. The shear-thinning behavior of the mucilage-betalain solutions was suitable for spray drying, wherein microcapsules with smooth and spherical morphologies were observed by SEM and characterized by FTIR. Additionally, microcapsules of mucilage achieved the retention of betalains at more than 90% after three months of storage. The colors obtained from the redissolution of the powders from skin and pulp samples do not present significant differences; therefore, the use of skin fruits can be a source of colorants, taking advantage of waste from other processes, promoting a culture of the use of environmentally-friendly technologies.

AB In this study, room-temperature drying, solar drying, heat pump drying (HPD), hot-air drying, and freeze drying were applied to investigate the volatile profiles and taste properties of roasted coffee beans by using electronic nose, electronic tongue, and headspace solid-phase microextraction gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HSSPME-GC-MS). Results indicated that the drying process markedly affected pH, total titratable acidity, total solids, and total soluble solids. Significant differences existed among all samples based on drying method; and the HPD method was superior for preserving ketones, phenols, and esters. Principal component analysis (PCA) combined with E-nose and E-tongue radar charts as well as the fingerprint of HS-SPME-GC-MS could clearly discriminate samples from different drying methods, with results obtained from hierarchical cluster analysis (the Euclidean distance is 0.75) being in agreement with those of PCA. These findings may provide a theoretical basis for the dehydration of coffee beans and other similar thermo-sensitive agricultural products.

AB This work describes the 25 classes of food additives that contain about 230 compounds with technological, sensorial and/or microbiological functionalities. These compounds are added to foods at the processing, packaging and transport steps, to improve the standard of quality, durability and stability of the product and adjust the colour, smell and flavour attributes. Food industries need to follow national and international quality standards that establish the conditions under which food additives may be used, and the food safety is guaranteed by strict quality control. This review describes the analytical techniques used in identification and quantification of food additives in foodstuffs, highlighting the main characteristics of each method (spectroscopy, chromatography and electroanalysis), and indicating the advantages and disadvantages typical of the methods used. Perspectives of the chemical analysis in the food industries are also discussed.

AB Marine shellfish provides a series of biofunctionality account of its high-protein level. In this study, the osteogenic effect of a novel peptide, YRGDVVPK, from Crassostrea gigas protein hydrolysates on preosteoblast MC3T3-E1 proliferation was examined. Synthetic peptide with 100 nM significantly promoted the proliferation of MC3T3-E1 cells for a treatment of 72 h assayed by MTT method, and which was confirmed by the increase of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity. The peptide, YRGDVVPK, was docked with integrin alpha 5 beta 1 (PDB ID: 3VI4), which is a surface receptor of MC3T3-E1. The interaction of the peptide with integrin alpha 5 beta 1 (PDB ID: 3VI4) was analyzed by the molecular modeling algorithm of CDOCKER, which showed a more stable combination than the original ligand. The results suggested the novel peptide could promote the preosteoblast MC3T3-E1 proliferation probably by activating the signaling pathway of MAPK, which is induced through binding with peptide YRG-DVVPK.

AB Deoxynucleoside 5-monophosphate N-glycosidase, DNPH1 is a member of the nucleoside 2-deoxyribosyl-transferase (NDT) family. This enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of deoxynucleoside monophosphates into free nucleobase moieties and 2-deoxyribose 5-phosphates.
   The DNPH1 enzymatic activity was first demonstrated in rats and then in humans. Subsequently the DNPH1 gene was identified in a variety of organisms, mainly in Metazoa. Herein, we demonstrate that despite DNPH1 genes being distributed in almost all metazoans, the occurrence of DNPH1 genes is mosaic. For example, they cannot be found anywhere in the entire Glade of Sauropsida or anywhere in the whole phyla of Arthropoda and Ctenophora. Even among mammals, there are organisms without functional DNPH1 protein (Camelidae and most likely Cetacea). By our knowledge, the DNPH1 gene is missing in plants, fungi and in majority of protists. Accordingly, the enzyme is apparently not of vital importance in all the branches of the Tree of Life. Surprisingly the DNPH1 gene may be found in archaea as well as in bacteria. This refers to the origin of the gene from the period before the archaea branched off from other bacteria.
   We show that the genomic and protein primary structures of DNPH1 are highly conserved and any modification in such a structure would result in conversion to a pseudogene, which could possibly be eliminated from the genome.

AB Background and Objective: Genetic modifiers contribute to variable disease phenotype in cystic fibrosis (CF). We explored the association between mutations in the hemochromatosis (HFE) gene and disease severity in adults with CF.
   Methods: HFE genotyping was performed in 163 adults with CF attending a single centre. Results were correlated with lung disease severity, prevalence of CF-related diabetes (CFRD) and history of meconium ileus (MI) or distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS).
   Results: Subjects with the C282Y substitution in the HFE protein (C282Y mutation) had a lower FEV1 percentage predicted (54% versus 66%, p = 0.029) and accelerated rate of FEV1 decline (-110 mL versus -80 mL per year respectively, p < 0.001) compared to subjects with a normal HFE genotype. C282Y substitutions were associated with increased rates of CFRD (58% versus 33%, p = 0.026) and a trend towards increased MI or DIOS (38% versus 19%, p = 0.05). H63D HFE substitutions were associated with a more rapid rate of decline in forced vital capacity (p = 0.01) and increased risk of MI or DIOS (p = 0.02).
   Conclusions: In subjects with CF, the C282Y HFE substitution was associated with worse lung function, and increased rates of CFRD and gastrointestinal complications. The H63D HFE substitution also impacted on disease phenotype, but to a lesser extent. The results support a role for HFE gene mutations as modifiers of CF phenotype.

AB To investigate the possible effects of epigenetic modification of testis protein-encoding genes on precocious puberty of Eriocheir sinensis, we used MeDIP-seq and hMeDIP-seq techniques to compare the methylation and hydroxymethylation of 263 E. sinensis protein-encoding genes known in the NCBI database in precocious testes with those in normally developing testes. The results showed that total methylation level of those genes was lower than their total hydroxymethylation level. Moreover, their total hydroxymethylation level in precocious testes was significantly lower than that in normal testes. In addition, no methylated genes had significant difference, but there were 37 different hydroxymethylated genes (DhMGs) in the precocious testes compared to the normal ones. Among the DhMGs, 21 were hypo-hydroxymethylated and 16 were hyper-hydroxymethylated. The hypo-hydroxymethylated DhMGs were associated with development, cell structural and cytoskeletal proteins, and response to stress. However, the hyper-hydroxymethylated DhMGs included immune-related genes, free radicals removement-related genes, protein folding-related genes, and so on. In addition, some DhMGs were hyper-hydroxymethylated while their homologous DhMGs were hypo-hydroxymethylated. The results of a qRT-PCR assay showed that the expression levels of 5 DhMGs randomly chosen presented a positive correlation with their hydroxymethylation levels. It can be seen that hydroxymethylation might regulate the expression of genes and be involved in precocious puberty to cause high mortality of crabs. Therefore, the hydroxymethylation level of DhMGs may be used as an evaluation index with economically meaningful growth and breeding traits.

AB The discovery of the phenomenon of gene silencing in 1990s opened new doors to biotechnology and plant breeding in order to supply food security. Food Security, as defined by FAO, it exists when all people, at all times, have economic access to safe, sufficient and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for a healthy and active life. Due to the need to ensure food security and also gene silencing potentials, research in this field began with astonishing speed and even it still continues. In this field, miRNA-associated gene silencing especially attracted the attention of scientists in order to decrypt the genes involved in process such as plant growth and development, metabolism, signal transduction, response against environmental stresses, nodule development in legumes and inducement male sterility. In addition, miRNA found a lot of applications in plant biotechnology like miRNA-based molecular markers and miRNA-based molecular breeding for plants improvement. Given to the growing importance of plant miRNAs (Phyto-miRNAs) in biotechnology and expansion of their applications in molecular breeding, it is necessary to review miRNA in an up-to-date schema. In this study, it was presented both the necessary foundations of miRNAs and their important uses in plant sciences, such as molecular markers and metabolic engineering. As a result, we hope to expand the use of artificial miRNAs in plants engineering.

AB Background and aims: Aberrant DNA methylation of cyclin-dependent kinase-like 2 (CDKL2) had been observed in several types of tumors. Herein, the present study was aimed to explore the epigenetic and expression status of CDKL2 and evaluate the diagnostic potential of CDKL2 methylation in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
   Methods: The methylation status of CDKL2 was detected by methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme based quantitative PCR (MSRE-qPCR) and bisulfite genomic sequencing (BGS). The mRNA expression of CDKL2 was measured using real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). The correlations between the methylation of CDKL2 and mRNA expression, clinicopathological features were evaluated.
   Results: Compared with normal liver tissues, the methylation levels of CDKL2 were significantly increased in the HCC tissues and cell lines (All p < 0.05). And the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showed that the hypermethylation of CDKL2 had a high specificity and sensitivity to distinguish adjacent non-tumor tissues from HCC tissues. Additionally, the mRNA expression levels of CDKL2 were decreased both in HCC tissues and cell lines than those in normal liver tissues (All p < 0.05), and the expression could be upregulated by 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment in HCC cell lines. Furthermore, the methylation of CDKL2 was negatively correlated with its mRNA expression (p < 0.001, r(s) = -0.513), and was associated with gender (p = 0.023), age (p = 0.001) and tumor size (p = 0.016).
   Conclusions: Our results showed that CDKL2 promoter hypermethylation played an important role in hepatocarcinogenesis and might be a valuable biomarker for HCC diagnosis.

AB The PROP paired-like homeobox 1 (PROP1) gene encodes a protein that regulates growth and development in mammals. Possessing DNA-binding and transcriptional activation abilities, PROP1 is able to control the expression of crucial anterior pituitary hormones including growth hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and prolactin. The objective of this study was to identify genetic variation in ovine PROP1 in 670 New Zealand Romney sheep. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected, two of which located in intron 1 were novel (c.109 + 40 T > C and c.109 + 207C > T), whilst the one located in exon 1 (c.45A > G) had been previously reported. These SNPs were arranged into three haplotypic variants - A(1), B-1 and C-1. At each locus, all three genotypes were observed with frequencies in accordance with the Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium. Association analysis revealed that the variant GG, CC and CC genotypes for c.45A > G, c.109 + 40 T > C and c.109 + 207C > T respectively were significantly associated with higher lamb tailing and weaning weights, and growth rate-to-weaning. The A(1) haplotype had a positive effect on tailing weight, weaning weight and growth rate, while the B-1 haplotype impacted growth traits negatively. These findings suggest that variations in ovine PROP1 could serve as potential genetic markers for use in marker-assisted selection and the breeding for animals with superior growth traits.

AB Breast cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors among females. Recent studies demonstrated that microRNAs (miRNAs) played an important role in the regulation of tumor progression. In our present study, we firstly detected miR-340-5p expression in breast cancer cell lines and found lower expression of miR-340-5p in breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, BT-549, ZR-75-1) through qRT-PCR. Overexpressed miR-340-5p inhibited cell proliferation and drug resistance to docetaxel with enhanced cell apoptosis of breast cancer cells. Through bioinformatic prediction, we found that LGR5 was a potential target of miR-340-5p. LGR5 was highly expressed in breast cancer cells. Relative expression of LGR5 was negatively regulated by miR-340-5p. Knockdown of LGR5 also inhibited cell proliferation and drug resistance to docetaxel with enhanced cell apoptosis of breast cancer cells. Moreover, knockdown of LGR5 decreased the expression of beta-catenin, c-myc, Survivin. The activation of Wnt/beta-catenin pathway contracted the effects of LGR5 siRNA, indicating that LGR5 siRNA inhibited cell proliferation and drug resistance with induced apoptosis via suppressing Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway in breast cancer. Taken together, our study demonstrated that overexpressed miR-340-5p inhibited cell proliferation and drug resistance with increased apoptosis of breast cancer cells through down regulating LGR5 expression via Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. The miR-340-5p/LGR5 axis may provide a new perspective for treatment for breast cancer.

AB The native Amazonian fish tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum) is the second-largest scaled fish in South America and the most common native species in Brazil. To preserve genetic resources with sufficient genetic diversity through germ cell cryopreservation and transplantation techniques, a molecular marker for identifying the cells is required to trace them during the manipulation processes. The vasa gene is a promising candidate, as its specific expression in germ cell lineage has been well-conserved throughout animal evolution. In this study, the full sequence of the vasa cDNA homolog from tambaqui was isolated and characterized, showing an open reading frame of 2010 bp encoding 669 amino acids. The putative protein was shown to contain eight conserved motifs of the DEAD-box protein family and high similarity to vasa homologs of other species. Tambaqui vasa (tvasa) mRNA expression was specific to the gonads, and in situ hybridization showed signals only in oocytes and spermatogonia. The results suggested that tvasa could be a useful germ cell marker in this species.

AB Psoriasis is an immune mediated inflammatory skin disease with complex etiology involving interplay between environmental and genetic risk factors as disease initiating event. Enhanced understanding on genetic risk factors, differentially expressed genes, deregulated proteins and pathway-targeted therapeutics have established multiple axis of psoriasis pathogenesis. So far, loci in 424 genes are reported to be associated with psoriasis alongside copy number variations and epigenetic alterations. From clinical perspective, presence of specific genetic trigger(s) in individual psoriasis patient could aid in devising a personalized therapeutic strategy. Therefore, the review presents an updates on reported genomic alterations and their subsequent course of cutaneous inflammations that potentially drive to psoriasis.

AB Zinc finger GATA like protein-1 (ZGLP1) is a nuclear zinc finger protein that regulates the interaction between somatic cells and germ cells during gonad developmental process in mammals. In this study, the zglp1 of Chinese tongue sole, Cynoglossus semilaevis (cysezglp1), was cloned and characterized for the first time in fish. Cysezglp1 had an open reading frame with five exons and was located to chromosome 9. The open reading frame of cysezglp1 consisted of 1692 nucleotides and encoded a 583 amino acid polypeptide. The predicted protein contained two zinc finger structures (Znf1 and Znf2), one of which was highly homologous to the GATA-type zinc finger domain. Multiple sequence alignment showed that Znf1 was conserved across different species while Znf2 was more divergent. Through quantitative Real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), we found that cysezglp1 was predominantly expressed in gonads, and the expression level of the ovary was significantly higher than that of the testis. We compared expression level in different embryonic stages and found that cysezglp1 mRNAs were mainly expressed in the fertilized egg to the cleavage stage, subsequently declining in the blastula stage. Cysezglp1 expression was not detected from the gastrulation stage onward. In the ovary, cysezglp1 expression was detected at 120 days after hatching and expression gradually increased with the maturation of the ovary. In situ hybridization showed that the cysezglp1 was mainly expressed in oocytes. Taken together, our results suggest that cysezglp1 may play an important role in the process of oogenesis in Chinese tongue sole.

AB As novel cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activators, Speedy/RINGO (hereafter named Speedy) proteins can directly regulate the cell cycle of vertebrates by binding to and activating various CDKs. Previous studies have shown that Speedy genes are highly associated with different types of cancer and other diseases. However, Speedy genes have not been systematically identified in mice, and their function and expression profiles remain elusive, which greatly hinders the functional and mechanistic study of Speedy genes in vivo. Here, we comprehensively identified Speedy genes in the mouse genome. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the Speedy gene family should be divided into three subfamilies, rather than the previously reported two subfamilies. Mice have two of the three subfamilies of Speedy genes, namely, subfamilies A and E. Speedy subfamily C genes have been lost from the mouse genome. By combining experimental and bioinformatics approaches, we found that the genes from subfamilies A and E have different expression profiles, indicating their functional divergence, which was also consistent with the phylogenetic results. The genes belonging to subfamily E showed only slightly different expression profiles, indicating their similar functions. Coexpression network analysis showed that the genes coexpressed with mouse Speedy genes were primarily enriched in reproduction-related mechanisms and there were significant functional differences between genes from subfamilies A and E, further demonstrating functional differentiation. In summary, we provide a comprehensive landscape (from evolution to expression and function) of the Speedy family in mice; we also demonstrate that Speedy genes mainly participate in reproduction -related mechanisms and that they have undergone functional differentiation in mice.

AB Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrine and metabolic heterogeneous disorder. The incidence of which reaches 5% to 10% among reproductive-age women. Abnormal folliculogenesis is considered to be a common characteristic of PCOS, but the cause of this disorder and its pathogenesis still remain uncertain. Previous studies had proved that dysregulation of microRNAs is related to the pathogenesis of PCOS. In this study, we investigated the effect of miR-323-3p on the human cumulus cells (CCs). We also investigated the underlying mechanisms of miR-323-3p on human granulosa-like tumor cell line (KGN) or primary human CCs by stimulating with Dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Our findings suggested that the level of miR-323-3p in human CCs of women with PCOS was down-regulated, compared with that of the control group. Moreover, the inhibition of the level of miR-323-3p could up-regulate of the steroidogenesis and promote the apoptosis in KGN cells. In addition, our data confirmed that the Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) gene was the direct target of miR-3233p. Furthermore, the mimic of miR-323-3p inhibited the expression of IGF-1, which down-regulated the levels of AR, AMHR-II, CYP19A, EGFR, and GATA-4. In conclusion, miR-323-3p targeting IGF-1 regulates the steroidogenesis and the activity of CCs, which plays an important role in the occurrence and development of PCOS. Our results have shown that miR-323-3p is a novel and promising molecular target for the improvement of the dysfunction of CCs in PCOS.

AB Giant clams represent symbiotic associations between a host clam and its extracellular zooxanthellae. They are able to grow in nutrient-deficient tropical marine environments and conduct light-enhanced shell formation (calcification) with the aid of photosynthates donated by the symbiotic zooxanthellae. In light, there is a high demand for inorganic carbon (C-i) to support photosynthesis in the symbionts and light-enhanced calcification in the host. In this study, we cloned and characterized a host Carbonic Anhydrase 4 homolog (CA4-like) from the whitish inner mantle of the giant clam Tridacna squamosa. The full cDNA coding sequence of CA4-like consisted of 1002 bp, encoding for 334 amino acids of 38.5 kDa. The host CA4-like was phenogramically distinct from algal CAs. The transcript level of CA4-like in the inner mantle was-3-fold higher than those in the colorful outer mantle and the ctenidium. In the inner mantle, CA4-like was immunolocalized in the apical membrane of the seawater-facing epithelial cells, but absent from the shell-facing epithelium. Hence, CA4-like was positioned to catalyze the conversion of HCO3- to CO2 in the ambient seawater which would facilitate CO2 uptake. The absorbed CO2 could be converted back to HCO3- by the cytoplasmic CA2-like. As the protein abundance of CA4-like increased in the inner mantle after 6 or 12 h of light exposure, there could be an augmentation of the total CA4-like activity to increase C-i uptake in light. It is plausible that the absorbed C-i was allocated preferentially for shell formation due to the close proximity of the seawater-facing epithelium to the shell-facing epithelium in the inner mantle that contains only few zooxanthellae.

AB Superoxide dismutase (SOD) acts as the first line of defence against reactive oxygen species (ROS) within cells. In this study, we characterized a novel SOD gene (PmCuZnSOD) from the dinoflagellate Prorocentrum minimum, and examined its structural features, putative origin and gene expression. The SOD cDNA is 895 bp in length, containing dinoflagellate splice-leader (dinoSL) sequence, 714-bp ORF (237 aa), and poly (A) tail. In addition, PmCuZnSOD is coded on the dinoflagellate nuclear genome without introns and in a non-tandem repeat manner; however, the encoded protein is probably localized in chloroplasts. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that it might be acquired from cyanobacteria via horizontal gene transfer (HGT) and then the gene possibly relocated from the chloroplast to the nuclear genome. Excess copper dramatically increased the PmCuZnSOD transcripts and SOD activity in cells, caused by ROS generation and decrease of photosynthetic efficiency in the treated cells. These suggest that CuZnSOD may function to defend against oxidative stress for the survival of the dinoflagellate.

AB Purpose: This study was aimed at exploring the mechanisms and identifying the key candidate genes associated with S. aureus and E. coli mastitis.
   Methods: A public microarray dataset GSE24560 was downloaded. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened in E. coil- and S. aureus-infected primary bovine mammary gland epithelial cell (pBMEC) samples, and compared with control samples at 1 h, 6 h, and 24 h. A functional enrichment analysis was performed, and construction of a gene co-expression network was performed based on genes that showed consistent changes over time, which were identified using time series expression analysis. Then, a miRNA/TF regulatory network was constructed based on the genes in the co-expression network. The genes in the miRNA/TF regulatory network were screened for involvement in related diseases. Furthermore, the expression of several selected DEGs was further validated using real-time RT-PCR.
   Results: In total, 92 and 81 DEGs showed continuous differential expression over time in the E. coli- and S. aureus-inoculated groups. DEGs in the E. coli-inoculated group were associated with the RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway, and those in the S. aureus-inoculated group were associated with the lysosome pathway. Time series expression analysis identified two gene clusters. NFKBIZ and GRO1 in the gene co-expression network were associated with inflammatory and defense responses. Moreover, several genes such as CXADR, APP, and CXCL2 in the miRNA/TF regulatory network, were associated with infection, inflammation, or stress-related diseases.
   Conclusion: RIG-I like receptor pathway and several DEGs such as NFKBIZ, GRO1, CXCL2, and CXADR may play critical roles in the response to infection in pBMECs.

AB Echinochloa crus-galli var. zelayensis, a variety of E. crus-galli (L.) Beauv. has evolved resistance to quinclorac, but the mechanism of resistance remains unclear. Treatments with quinclorac, cause rapid leaf chlorosis, continuous decrease in the chlorophyll content to about 0.4 times, and rapid decline in biomass by about 20% in sensitive E. crus-galli var. zelayensis within 72 h. Then transcriptome sequencing for quinclorac-sensitive and-resistant E. crus-galli var. zelayensis biotypes was performed, and more differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were observed in the sensitive biotype (1115 DEGs, including 548 up-regulated and 567 down-regulated) than that in the resistant biotype (901 DEGs, including 373 up-regulated and 528 down-regulated). Thirty-four photosynthesis related candidate genes were screened, in which twenty-nine genes were more affected by quinclorac in the sensitive biotype than that in the resistant biotype. The qPCR verification involving more sampling time-points revealed that on continuous treatment with 50 mu mol/L quinclorac, expression levels of 34 photosynthesis-related genes dropped significantly by 2-1000 times within 12 h in the sensitive biotype. Following significant or marginal decline in expression at 6 h after quinclorac treatment, recovery of the expression levels of 21 genes was observed after 12 h and the expression levels of another 13 genes remained unaltered in the resistant biotype. It is hypothesized that the sustained sharp decrease in the expression of photosynthesis-related genes is a major cause of death in the sensitive biotype. Further, it is inferred that there may be a regulatory mechanism in the resistant biotype that allowed the expression of these genes to be significantly unaffected or to rapidly recover, in turn preventing severe damage to the plants caused by quinclorac.

AB Background: Diabetic Nephropathy (DN) is one of the microvascular complications of diabetes and its early diagnosis can improve patient's quality of life. Genetic factors may increase the risk of DN development. This study aimed to evaluate the association of vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene polymorphisms and DN.
   Method: A total of 313 Iranian participants including 104 diabetic patients with nephropathy (DN), 100 diabetic patients without nephropathy (D) and 109 healthy people (HC) were studied. The frequencies of rs7975232, rs731236 and rs4516035 variants of VDR gene were determined and compared between three groups. Estimated haplotype frequencies between polymorphisms in the cases and controls were also calculated.
   Results: No significant differences were identified for allele /genotype frequencies in HC, D and DN groups. However haplotype analysis showed that haplotype encompassing CCC alleles for rs7975232, rs731236 and rs4516035 variants, respectively was more frequent in DN subjects compared to HC (p-value = 0.01) and also, haplotype comprising TCC alleles was more frequent in DN group compared to both HC and D groups (p-value = 0.004 and 0.007, respectively).
   Conclusion: Our study identified that CCC and TCC VDR haplotypes are risk factors for DN in patients with diabetes type 2.

AB X-chromosomal short tandem repeats (X-STRs) have been widely used in forensic practice involving complicated cases of kinship and also play an increasingly important role in population genetics. X-STRs have been studied in regional populations of China but there is a lack of data for the Manchu population. In this study, we have investigated the forensic genetic properties of 12 X-STRs in the Investigator Argus X-12 Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) in 772 Manchu (male = 514, female = 258) individuals from the Xiuyan and Huanren Manchu autonomous counties of Liaoning province. We observed a total of 166 alleles at 12 X-STR loci with allele frequencies ranging from 0.001295to 0.615285. The most polymorphic locus was DXS10135 with 24 alleles while DXS7423 was the least polymorphic locus with 5 alleles. We found significant linkage disequilibrium (LD) between the following pairs of markers for males: DXS10103/DXS10101, DXS10135/DXS10146, DXS10101/DXS10148, DXS10135/DXS10148, DXS7423/DXS10148 and DXS10079/DXS10148. For females, LD was only observed for DXS10103/DXS10101. The combined power of discrimination was 0.9999999979699 for males and 0.999999999999998 for females. The numbers of observed haplotypes in Manchu males were 310, 172, 182 and 172 in four linkage groups; LG1, LG2, LG3 and LG4, respectively, however, these linkage groups did not form stable haplotypes as indicated by linkage equilibrium (LE) of STRs within the groups and significant LD between the groups. This study represents an extensive report on X-STR marker variation in the Manchu population for forensic applications and population genetic studies.

AB The TP73 gene is considered as one of the members of TP53 gene family and shows much homology to p53 gene. TP73 gene plays a pivotal role in cancer studies in addition to other biological functions. Codon usage bias (CUB) is the phenomenon of unequal usage of synonymous codons for an amino acid wherein some codons are more frequently used than others and it reveals the evolutionary relationship of a gene. Here, we report the pattern of codon usage in TP73 gene using various bioinformatic tools as no work was reported yet. Nucleotide composition analysis suggested that the mean nucleobase C was the highest, followed by G and the gene was GC rich. Correlation analysis between codon usage and GC3 suggested that most of the GC-ending codons showed positive correlation while most of the AT-ending codons showed negative correlation with GC3 in the coding sequences of TP73 gene variants in human. The CUB is moderate in human TP73 gene as evident from intrinsic codon deviation index (ICDI) analysis. Nature selected against two codons namely ATA (isoleucine) and AGA (arginine) in the coding sequences of TP73 gene during the course of evolution. A significant correlation (p < 0.05) was found between overall nucleotide composition and its composition at the 3rd codon position, indicating that both mutation pressure and natural selection might influence the CUB. The correlation analysis between ICDI and biochemical properties of protein suggested that variation of CUB was associated with degree of hydrophobicity and length of protein.

AB Kinesin-14 KIFC1 plays an important role in vesicular transport, microtubule organization, and spermiogenesis. In this study, we first investigated the microtubule distribution and expression pattern of KIFC1 during spermiogenesis of P. esculenta. Microtubules are abundant during spermiogenesis of P. esculenta and may be related to the generation and maintenance of pseudopodia-like cytoplasmic protrusions and nuclear reshaping. The PeKIFC1 protein is conserved with a motor domain where microtubule and ATP binding sites are predicted, a coiled-coil domain and a divergent tail domain. The Pe-kifcl gene was extensively expressed and showed the highest expression in coelomic fluid where spermiogenesis occurs. We further observed the expression of kifcl mRNA and protein and found that Pe-KIFC1 protein primarily co-localized with microtubules during spermiogenesis, indicating that KIFCI might play several roles during this process via its cargo transport and/or microtubule organization function. In addition, co-localization of mitochondria and KIFC1 was also detected during spermiogenesis, which were located in the midpiece in mature sperm, suggesting that mitochondria might be a cargo of Pe-KIFC1 that participates in the intracellular distribution of mitochondria and formation of the mid piece. Based on our detailed observations of the dynamic distribution of microtubules, KIFC1, and mitochondria during spermiogenesis and the conserved function of KIFC1 in cargo transport and microtubule organization, functional models of Pe-KIFC1 during spermiogenesis are proposed, including the participation of KIFC1 in nuclear reshaping and midpiece formation.

AB Androgens are critical hormones that regulate sex differentiation, sexual maturation, and spermatogenesis in vertebrates, which is mainly mediated by androgen receptors (ARs). Reports on transcript variants of ar (AR encoding gene) in human are almost always associated with cancers and androgen insensitivity syndrome. However, the knowledge of ar variants in teleosts is scarce. In this study, ar beta and two transcript variants of ar alpha (ar alpha 1 and ar alpha 2) in olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) were cloned and analyzed. Their expression patterns were investigated in 16 adult female and male tissues by RT-PCR, respectively. aral was expressed in the majority of tissues excluding male liver, medulla oblongata and female cerebellum, with higher levels in male gonad, kidney, head kidney, intestine, stomach, spleen, heart and gill than in female. ar alpha 2 had similar expression patterns as ar alpha 1, with lower levels in general. ar beta was also widely expressed in various tissues excluding male spleen, female spleen and gill, with higher levels in male gonad, kidney, head kidney, intestine and lower levels in hypothalamus than in female. Compared with ar beta, much lower expression levels of ar alpha 1 and ar alpha 2 were detected in different brain areas. The real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) results showed that the total ara expression level was relatively higher during olive flounder gonadal differentiation and before the onset of testis differentiation, whereas ar beta was expressed significantly higher during male gonadal differentiation period than female gonadal differentiation period. The in vitro transient transfection assays showed that AR alpha 1, AR alpha 2 and AR beta could all suppress the activity of cyp19 alpha (p450arom aromatase gene) promoter, and the inhibitory effect of AR alpha 1 was dose dependent. Our results imply that ar alpha 1, ar alpha 2 and ar beta are sex-related genes and they might play important roles in gonadal differentiation in flounder.

AB 4-amino-2-trifluoromethyl-phenyl retinate (ATPR), a novel all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) derivative designed and synthesized by our team, has been demonstrated its anti-tumor effect through inducing differentiation and inhibiting proliferation. Eukaryotic initiation factor 3a (eIF3a) plays a critical role in affecting tumor cell proliferation and differentiation. However, whether eIF3a is implicated in chronic myeloid leukemia cells differentiation remains unclear. Our results demonstrated that eIF3a could be suppressed by ATPR in K562 cells. The results also confirmed that ATPR could arrest cell cycle in G0/G1 phase and induced differentiation. Moreover, over-expression of eIF3a promoted not only protein expression of c-myc and cyclin D1, but also prevented the expression of p-Raf-1, p-ERK and the myeloid differentiation markers CD11b and CD14 and had an influence on inducing the morphologic mature. However, silencing eIF3a expression by small interfering RNA could have an adverse effect on K562 cells. In addition, PD98059 (a MEK inhibitor) could block cell differentiation of CML cells and contributed to the expression of c-myc and cyclin D1. In conclusion, these results indicated that elF3a played an important role in ATPR-induced cell differentiation in K562 cells, its mechanism might be related to its ability in regulating the activation of ERK1/2 signaling pathway in vitro.

ID PLASMA-MEMBRANE; INSULIN; RAB7; TRAFFICKING; TRANSPORT; MUSCLE
AB Glucose transport into skeletal muscle is mediated by the principal glucose transporter protein, GLUT4, which can be transported from intracellular vesicles to the cytoplasmic membrane, and the translocation of GLUT4 vesicles requires a variety of Rab proteins. Previously we reported a new type of TBC1D15 from C. plagiosum with Rab-GAP activity for Rab7. Here we reported that TBC1D15 regulated glucose uptake by affecting the trans location of GLUT4 through late endosomal pathway. When TBC1D15 was knocked out by CRISPR/Cas9, a significant reduction in 2-NBDG uptake was observed, and the total amount of GLUT4 was significantly reduced in TBC1D15(-/-) cells compared to that in WT cells. Furthermore, concentrated distribution of Rab7 in Lamp1-decorated late endosome/lysosome and an increase in co-localization between GLUT4 and Rab7 was observed in TBC1D15(-/-) cells. These results suggested that TBC1D15 served as a master regulator in GLUT4 translocation and further affected GLUT4-mediated glucose uptake.

AB Heartwater is an economically important disease of ruminants caused by the tick-borne bacterium Ehrlichia ruminantium. The disease is present throughout sub-Saharan Africa as well as on several islands in the Caribbean, where it poses a risk of spreading onto the American mainland. The dominant immune response of infected animals is directed against the variable outer membrane proteins of E. ruminantium encoded by a polymorphic multigene family. Here, we examined the full-length sequence of the major antigenic protein 1 (map1) family genes in multiple E. ruminantium isolates from different African countries and the Caribbean, collected at different time points to infer the possible role of recombination breakpoint and natural selection. A high level of recombination was found particularly in map1 and map1-2. Evidence of strong negative purifying selection in map1 and balancing selection to maintain genetic variation across these samples from geographically distinct countries suggests host pathogen co-evolution. This co-evolution between the host and pathogen results in balancing selection by maintaining genetic diversity that could be explained by the demographic history of long-term pathogen pressure. This signifies the adaptive role and the molecular evolutionary forces underpinning E. ruminantium map1 multigene family antigenicity.

AB Background: Preeclampsia (PE) is a pregnancy complication that is characterized by higher blood pressure, together with higher protein quantity presence in the urine, which occurs after 20 weeks of gestation leading to severity of adverse maternal and fetal consequences. Some special microRNAs (miRNAs) expressed in placentas may be related to the occurrence of PE. Researchers have found that the expression of miR-431 in PE placentas was increased if compared with normal placentas; however, the effect and mechanism of miR-431 in PE are still unknown.
   Methods: In this study, we compared the expression levels of miR-431 and its putative target gene Zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) in 30 PE placentas and 30 normal placenta tissues. The effects of miR-431 and ZEB1 were verified by CCK-8 assay, transwell migration and invasion assay, cell cycle distribution assay and apoptosis assay in HTR-8/SVneo cells transfected with miR-431 mimic, siR-ZEB1 and their negative controls.
   Results: Results revealed that miR-431 was markedly added, while the mRNA and protein expressions of ZEB1 were decreased in PE placentas. The functional tests showed over-expression of miR-431 suppressed ZEB1 expression and decreased the migration and invasive capacity of trophoblast cells. MiR-431 overexpression induced apoptosis of HTR-8/SVneo cells, but it had no significant effect on cell proliferation and the distribution of cell cycle. In addition, siR-ZEB1 simulated the roles of miR-431 mimic. We found that miR-431 mimic and siR-ZEB1 reduced the epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) with added E-cadherin expression and reduced vimentin expression in the cell line.
   Conclusions: In conclusion, we found that miR-431 inhibited the migration and invasion of trophoblastic cells by targeting ZEB1, which might give rise to the onset of PE.

AB Salinity is one of the major abiotic stresses which affect plant growth and productivity by imposing dual stress, ionic and osmotic stress, on plants. Halophytes which are adapted to complete their life cycle in saline soil keep the transcript expression of stress-responsive genes constitutively higher in the optimum growth environments, which can be further increased by several folds under stress conditions. The transcript expression of SbNHX1 gene, cloned from a leafless succulent halophyte Salicornia brachiata, was up-regulated under salinity stress, but its transcriptional regulation has not been studied so far. In the present study, a 1727 bp putative promoter (upstream to translation start site) of the SbNHX1 gene was cloned using a genome walking method. The bioinformatics analysis identified important stress-responsive cis-regulatory motifs, GT1, MBS, LTR and ARE, in addition to two leaf-specific enhancer motifs. The GUS expression analysis of stable transgenic tobacco plants, transformed with a transcriptional fusion of GUS with the full SbNHX1 promoter (NP1) or any of its five deletion fragments (NP2 to NP6), showed that the deletion of two enhancer motifs resulted in the sudden decrease in GUS expression in leaves but not in the stem or root tissues. In contrast, under salinity stress, the higher induction of GUS expression observed in NP1 and NP2 was correlated by the presence of salt-inducible GT1- and MBS-motifs which is distributed only in NP1 and NP2 deletion promoter fragments. Finally, we concluded that the SbNHX1 promoter has a 624 bp (-1727 to -1103 bp) regulatory region which contains the two leaf-specific enhancer motifs and salinity stress-inducible GT-1 and MBS motifs. We suggest the SbNHX1 gene promoter and fragments as a candidate alternative promoter/s for crop engineering for better stress tolerance, which can be amended according to the desired level of expression needed.

AB A total of 100 specimens of the greater lizardfish Saurida tumbil were collected during the current investigation from the coasts of Hurghada City at the Gulf of Suez, Red Sea, Egypt; and necropsied to study their metazoan parasites. Of the total specimens collected, 32.0% were found to be naturally infected with hemiurid trematodes. The prevalence of parasitic infections increased to 48.0% during winter and fell to 16.0% during summer season with no mixed infections being observed. Two species of the hemiurid trematodes were recovered from the stomach of the infected fish samples; both belonged to the genus, Lecithocladium, in the family Hemiuridae. The morphometrics of their different body parts were characterized by light microscopy. Comparisons between the recovered parasites and previously studied species showed that the present investigation is the first report of Lecithocladium species infecting marine fish in the Red Sea. Additionally, molecular analysis of the parasites' 18S small subunit (SSu) rDNA was performed to determine their phylogenetic position in relation to previously recorded species in GenBank, which distinctly supported the morphological characteristics identified here. Two hemiurid species from the genus, Lecithocladium, to be L. cristatum and L. parviovum, were identified. Comparison of 18S rDNA sequences revealed that they had 98.0% sequence identity with L exciswn (gb vertical bar AJ287529) with a low divergence value. On the basis of these results, the two species isolated here were recorded within a new host and locality records in Egypt.

AB Circular RNAs (circRNAs) as new types of endogenous non-coding RNAs have been recently identified important roles in certain types of pathological responses, and in the occurrence and progression of a variety of human malignancies. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the role of has_circ_0078710, which is back spliced by THBS2 gene in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Expression levels of has_circ_0078710 were tested in both HCC tissue samples and cells using real-time qRT-PCR. Hascirc_0078710 was significantly unregulated in HCC tissues and cells. Moreover, HCC patients with high level of has_circ_0078710 had the advance stage (TNM III-IV). Finally, we constructed an interaction network among circRNA-miRNA-mRNA and we identified miR-31 as the has_circ_0078710-associatedmiRNA. Furthermore, overexpression of has in HCC could up-regulate HDAC and CDK2 levels by sponging miR-31, simultaneously mediating the expression of cell cycle components (cyclin A, cyclin D1, CDK4) and negative cell cycle regulator p21. In vitro and in vivo functional studies showed that overexpression of has in HepG2, SMMC-7721 cell lines significantly promoted cell proliferation, migration, invasion and tumor growth by inducing the cell cycle progression. In summary, we identified Hassirc_0078710 as a potential HCC biomarker.

AB Brown algae, rich in antioxidants and other bioactive compounds, are important dietary seaweeds in many cultures. Like other marine macroalgae, brown seaweeds are known to accumulate the halogens iodine and bromine. Comparatively little is known about the chemistry of chlorine in seaweeds. We used synchrotron-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy to measure total non-volatile organochlorine and -bromine in five edible brown seaweeds: Laminaria digitata, Fucus vesiculosus, Pelvetia canaliculata, Saccharina latissima, and Undaria pinnatifida. Organochlorine concentrations range from 120 to 630 mg.kg(-1) dry weight and organobromine from 150 to 360 mg.kg(-1), comprising mainly aromatic organohalogens in both cases. Aliphatic organochlorine exceeds aliphatic organobromine but is positively correlated with it among the seaweeds. Higher organochlorine levels appear in samples with more lipid moieties, suggesting lipid chlorination as a possible formation pathway. Particulate organohalogens are not correlated with antioxidant activity or polyphenolic content in seaweed extracts. Such compounds likely contribute to organohalogen body burden in humans and other organisms.

AB Fish protein isolates (FPI) were recovered from catfish heads and frames by alkaline extraction (AE) and salt extraction (SE) and made into surimi-like gels. Protein patterns and content, moisture, color, and texture of cooked protein gels were compared with commercial products. Sodium-dodecyl-sulfate poly acrylamide gel electrophoreses (SDS-PAGE) indicated that the integrity of major myofibrillar proteins was maintained during the extraction process, and the protein patterns were almost the same with that of the commercial surimi products. The yields of AE-FPI (heads: 36%; frames: 55%) were much higher (p < 0.05) than that of SE-FPI (heads: 9%; frames: 16%). Firmness of cooked protein gels made from heads was similar with that made from frames. Firmness of cooked protein gels made from FPI extracted by the SE method (heads: 0.45 kg/cm(2); frames: 0.43 kg/cm(2)) was significantly lower (p < 0.05) than that made from FPI extracted by the AE method (heads: 1.96 kg/cm(2); frames: 1.85 kg/cm(2)).

AB Naturally derived antioxidants are in high demand as the food industry strives to meet consumer preferences for non-synthetic additives. Alkylresorcinols (ARs) represent a novel class of natural antioxidants that can be derived from a natural waste stream (bran) and have the potential to inhibit lipid peroxidation given their phenolic structure. The antioxidant activity of rye bran extract containing ARs was investigated in an oil-in-water emulsion and was found to inhibit lipid oxidation reactions. The concentration of ARs in the continuous phase of emulsions was measured to understand partitioning behavior, as this is known to impact antioxidant activity. It was found that a majority of the ARs were associated with the lipid phase and those in the continuous phase were associated with surfactant micelles, perhaps inhibiting their interaction with water-soluble pro-oxidants. These results show that a rye bran extract containing ARs can function as a radical scavenging antioxidant in lipid dispersions.

AB We conducted in vitro assays to investigate the antioxidant properties of aqueous or ethanolic extracts of roasted rice hulls. Phenolic compound contents were analyzed via HPLC, and comprehensive chemical profiles were obtained via H-1 NMR and H-1-H COSY NMR. Rice hulls were roasted at 150, 180, and 230 degrees C for 20 min, after which the aqueous and 70% ethanol extracts were obtained. In vitro assays showed that rice hulls roasted at 230 degrees C possessed very strong antioxidant properties (p < 0.05). Comprehensive chemical profiles determined via NMR showed that roasting increased the contents of specific amino acids and monosaccharides and reduced the organic acid contents. p-Coumaric, vanillic, and ferulic acids were the most dominant phenolic compounds present in the sample. Added roasted rice hull extracts enhanced the oxidative stability of bulk oil and in O/W emulsions at 60 degrees C. However, the extracts accelerated lipid oxidation rates of oils heated at 180 degrees C.

AB The objective of this work was to explore the storage properties of a structured oil-in-water emulsion containing both water-and fat-soluble bioactive compounds from bilberries (Vaccinium myrtillus L.). Bilberry seed oil (BSO) was dispersed in a continuous aqueous phase of anthocyanins (AC) and whey protein isolate. The microstructure was evaluated using light microscopy and the effect of anthocyanins on lipid oxidation and microbial growth was investigated. The results showed that it was possible to generate a stable emulsion structure that resisted phase separation during 25 weeks of storage. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry measurements of the fatty acids in the BSO during storage showed that AC had a protective effect against lipid oxidation. The AC did not have an antimicrobial effect against the investigated strains Zygosaccharomyces bailii (ATCC 42476) and Aspergillus niger (ATCC 6275 (M68)).

AB Stability and sensitivity of toxic elements determination is still unsatisfactory in agricultural product using laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS). A simple and low cost sample pretreatment method named solid-liquid-solid transformation method was proposed in this work. The target analytes of cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) from rice samples were prepared through ultrasound assisted extraction in hydrochloric acid solution. The solution was dropped on the glass slide after centrifuging process and was further dried on a heater. Finally, the glass slide contained the analytes was carried out for LIBS determination. Compare with conventional pellet method, the spectral intensity of Cd and Pb element were enhanced significantly using LIBS. The limits of detection were 2.8 and 43.7 mu g/kg, respectively. The limits of quantification were 9.3 and 145.7 mu g/kg, respectively. The results demonstrated that LIBS coupled with ultrasound assisted extraction should be a promising tool to detect toxic elements in rice.

AB Meat products are prone to adulteration by the replacement of meat from more expensive animal species with meat from cheaper sources. We present a DNA metabarcoding method allowing the identification and differentiation of 15 mammalian and six poultry species in foodstuffs. The method, developed on the MiSeq (R) platform, targets a mitochondrial 16S rDNA region recently found to be suitable for the differentiation of 300 mammalian species. We designed a novel primer pair for poultry and applied it in combination with the primer pair for mammalian species in a duplex assay. The applicability of the method was investigated by analysing DNA extracts from muscle, DNA extract mixtures and extracts from model sausages. Our results indicated that the species of interest can be identified, differentiated and detected down to a proportion of 0.1%. Since 96 samples can be sequenced in one run, the method has high potential for application in routine analysis.

AB This work aimed at improving knowledge about sweetness in dry wines. Following on from the empirical observations of winegrowers, we assessed the contribution of grape seeds to wine sensory properties. An inductive fractionation method guided by gustatometry was used to isolate and characterize sweet-tasting compounds from grapes. Fractionation of grape seed macerates was achieved by liquid-liquid extraction, centrifugal partition chromatography (CPC) and preparative HPLC. Then, the structures of the purified compounds were elucidated by use of FTMS and NMR. Five compounds were identified: two new compounds, 2-hydroxy-3-methylpentanoic-2-O-beta-glucopyranoside (H3MP-G) and 2-hydroxy-4-methylpentanoic-2-O-beta-glucopyranoside acids (H4MP-G), along with gallic-4-O-beta-glucopyranoside acid (AG-G), 3-indolyl-(2R)-O-beta-D-glycoside lactic acid (ILAG) and epi- DPA-3'-O-beta-glucopyranoside acid (epi-DPA-G). These compounds exhibited various levels of sweetness in a hydro-ethanolic solution and in white and red wines. Additionally, H3MP-G, H4MP-G and epi-DPA-G were identified for the first time in grapes and wines, whereas AG-G has already been reported in white grapes but never in wine.

AB Chemical composition and colorimetric parameters of alcoholic liqueurs prepared from rose petals were evaluated by comparing the potential of three cultivars ('Amadeus', 'Colossal Meidiland' and 'Rosanna') and three traditional methods of preparation (fresh/air-dried petals extracted in 50% ethanol or aqueous sucrose syrup). Extraction was performed at room temperature for 2 weeks. High performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry was used to confirm the presence of 6 anthocyanins, 4 flavanols, 4 phenolic acids, 2 hydrolysable tannins and 31 flavonols in petal liqueurs. The highest concentrations of anthocyanins were determined in extracts from 'Amadeus' petals, followed by 'Colossal Meidiland' and finally, 'Rosanna'. The best extraction yields and optimal colour characteristics were achieved by ethanolic extraction of dry petals followed by fresh petal extraction in ethanol and, finally, extraction in sucrose syrup. Air-dehydration of 'Amadeus' petals prior to extraction in 50% ethanol yielded rose liqueur with the best all round characteristics.

AB This study investigates the effects of pre-acidification (pH 6.7-5.4) of skim milk, followed by pH-restoration of the retentates, on spray-drying performance, physico-chemical properties and functionality of the resulting milk protein concentrate (MPC). Powder recovery decreased with decreasing pH of pre-acidification but improved with pH-restoration. Colloidal calcium was gradually solubilized with decreasing pH of pre-acidification but was slightly recovered by pH-restoration. Dissociation of micellar caseins increased with decreasing pH of pre-acidification of skim milk and was further increased by pH-restoration. Casein micelles maintained their overall structures at pre-acidification pH of 6.7-6.0, and partially disintegrated into loosely entangled aggregates at pH 5.7-5.4; while after pH-restoration, micelles generally maintained their overall structures at pre-acidification pH of 6.0, and completely disintegrated at pH 5.7-5.4. Solubility and emulsifying properties of MPC improved with decreasing pH of pre-acidification and with pH-restoration. Heat stability of MPC declined with decreasing pH of pre-acidification but improved with pH-restoration.

AB To improve the thermal stability and adsorption performance, xanthan gum was modified with acrylamide and trimethylolpropane triglycidyl ether (TTE). The modified xanthan gum (XGTTE) was characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffractogram (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The characteristic peaks at 3449, 1655, 1611 and 1420 cm(-1) in the FT-IR confirm the modification. The XGTTE crystal grew well upon addition of TTE. The XRD and DSC data revealed that the XGTTE enhanced its thermal stability. Analysis of SEM revealed that the grafting introduced major changes on the microstructure making it porous and resulting in the adsorption of crystal violet (CV) with flocculation. The CV adsorption capacity of the hydrogel with different dosages of TTE (XGTTE2, XGTTE3, XGTTE4, XGTTE5 and XGTTE6) were between 28.13 with 35.12 mg/g. In addition, the adsorption capacity, thermal stability, and swelling property of XGTTE4 were the best.

AB Suboptimal vaccination uptake may be associated with outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases in many parts of the world. Researchers and practitioners working on improving vaccine acceptance and uptake gathered together for the fifth annual meeting on vaccine acceptance, organized by the Fondation Merieux at its conference centre in Veyrier-du-Lac, France, to share their experiences in building, improving and sustaining vaccine confidence and uptake. The importance and value of truly listening to people and seeking to understand the perspectives of vaccine hesitant people was emphasized throughout the meeting. The benefits of social marketing, which can be used to influence behavior that benefit individuals and communities for the greater social good, and its integration into strategies aimed at improving vaccine acceptance and uptake, were discussed. Healthcare professionals (HCPs) need tools and training to help them engage effectively in vaccination acceptance conversations with parents and other patients. Two potential tools, motivational interviewing (MI) and AIMS (Announce, Inquire, Mirror, Secure), were presented. Examples of MI approaches that have successfully improved vaccination acceptance and uptake included a project in Canada aimed at parents just after the birth of their baby. The role of mandates to increase vaccination uptake in the short-term was discussed, but to achieve sustainable vaccination uptake this must be complemented with other strategies. These annual meetings have led to the creation of an informal community of practice that facilitates cross-pollination between the various disciplines and different settings of those involved in this area of research and implementation. It was agreed that we must continue our efforts to promote vaccine acceptance and thus increase vaccination uptake, by fostering more effective vaccination communication, monitoring of the media conversation on vaccination, designing and rigorously evaluating targeted interventions, and surveillance of vaccine acceptance and uptake with pertinent, reliable measures.

AB In the United States, human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine has been recommended for females since 2006 and for males since 2011. However, national HPV vaccination coverage among adolescents is lower than national targets, and many adolescents initiate HPV vaccination later than the recommended age. We analyzed records for >2 million persons born during 1996-2000 who initiated HPV vaccination at age 9 through 16 years from six Immunization Information Systems Sentinel Sites, displayed the distribution of HPV vaccination initiation age, and calculated HPV vaccination coverage. More adolescents in recent cohorts initiated HPV vaccination at the recommended age of 11-12 years, the majority of whom received another recommended vaccine on the same day. However, >40% of all vaccinated adolescents did not initiate the HPV vaccination until age 13 years or later. Continued efforts are needed to increase HPV vaccination initiation at the recommended age. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

DE Acceptance; HPV; Vaccine; Immunisation; Polish
AB Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines are currently utilised globally in national immunisation programmes. Many new European migrants have settled in the United Kingdom (UK) since the 2004 European Union expansion with approximately 91,000 Polish people resident in Scotland. Following anecdotal reports from several NHS Boards within Scotland of lower HPV vaccine uptake in Polish communities compared with other ethnic minorities, an extract containing both forename and surname, was taken from the Scottish Immunisation Recall System (SIRS) for all girls in S2 and S3 in school years 2014/15 to 2016/17. We then used the OnoMap algorithm software to derive ethnicity. OnoMap identified between 289 and 321 age-eligible girls as Polish with significant disparity noted for completed HPV vaccine uptake between UK (87.2-89.8%) and Polish ethnicities (69.7-77.2%) (P < 0.01). Preliminary discussions with Polish families suggest that vaccine programme differences, trust in medical/healthcare practitioners, and cultural influences may be important drivers of acceptance.

AB Failure to vaccinate is well-recognised in Europe as a contributing factor to outbreaks of infectious diseases. Low immunisation rates are often associated with religious, social and ethnic minorities, including refugees or migrant groups. Polish people form Scotland's newest and largest migrant group. They have moved to Scotland since 2004, joining established ethnic minorities from China, the Indian subcontinent and Africa.
   Scotland has had a seasonal influenza nasal vaccination programme for all primary school children since 2013. We investigated three primary schools in Edinburgh, which had reported low influenza vaccination uptake rates in 2016 and 2017 and found that these schools contained many pupils from ethnic minorities, the majority of whom were Polish. Pupils were categorized as one of three ethnic groupings: White British, Polish and Other Identified Ethnic Minority (DIEM). We ascertained ethnicity using NHS and Education Department information sources and name recognition. We examined vaccine acceptance, declination and non-return of consent forms.
   In 2017, nasal influenza vaccine uptake was 70.7% (65.2-75.6%, p < 0.001) in White British, 60.9% (53.967.6%%, p < 0.001) in other identified ethnic minorities and 25.0% (20.9-29.6%, p > 0.001) in Polish children. White British children were more likely to return completed forms (78.9%) than other groups (OIEM 68.2% and Polish 61.8%). 36.8% of Polish families completed a consent form declining vaccination compared to 6.2% of White British families.
   These findings demonstrate that significant differences exist in nasal influenza vaccination uptake rates, which have important implications for the trans-national study of vaccine hesitancy. Further qualitative work and an investigation of uptake rates of other childhood immunisations in Polish and other migrant groups is required to assess differences in uptake and behaviours.

TI Lack of immune interference between inactivated polio vaccine and
   inactivated rotavirus vaccine co-administered by intramuscular injection
   in two animal species
SO VACCINE
LA English
DT Article
DE IRV; IPV; Combination vaccine; Dose sparing
ID IMMUNOGENICITY; MORTALITY
AB A parenteral inactivated rotavirus vaccine (IRV) in development could address three problems with current live oral rotavirus vaccines (ORV): their lower efficacy in low and middle-income countries (LMICs), lingering concerns about their association with intussusception, and their requirement for a separate supply chain with large volume cold storage. Adding a new parenteral IRV to the current schedule of childhood immunizations would be more acceptable if it could be combined with another injectable vaccine such as inactivated polio vaccine (IPV). Current plans for polio eradication call for phasing out oral polio vaccine (OPV) and transitioning to IPV, initially in LMICs as a single dose booster after two doses of OPV and ultimately as a two dose schedule. Today in many LMICs, IPV is administered as a standalone vaccine, which involves a separate cold chain and is relatively costly. We therefore tested in two animal models formulations of IPV with IRV to determine whether co-administration might interfere with the immune response to each product and spare antigen dose for both vaccines. Our results demonstrate that IRV when adjuvanted with alum and administered alone or in combination with IPV did not impair the immune responses to either rotavirus or poliovirus serotypes 1, 2 and 3. Similarly, IPV when formulated and administered alone or together with IRV induced comparable levels of neutralizing antibody to poliovirus type 1, 2 and 3. Furthermore, comparable antibody titers were observed in animals vaccinated with low, middle or high dose of IPV or IRV in combination. This dose sparing and the lack of interference between IPV and IRV administered together represent another step to support the further development of this novel combination vaccine for children.

ID WORKERS; EMPLOYEES; COVERAGE
AB Background: Healthcare worker (HCW) vaccination against seasonal influenza is considered a key preventative measure within hospitals and aged-care facilities (ACFs) to reduce the risk of transmission and related disease. Despite this, many facilities experience persistently low vaccination coverage rates and mandatory vaccination has been explored as a potential strategy to improve coverage. This study explored the current climate around staff vaccination in Australia from the perspective of opinion leaders and key stakeholders.
   Methods: Qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted between April and July 2018 with 22 individuals involved in vaccination policy and program development and implementation from a range of organisations including state health departments, hospitals and ACFs across Australia. In addition, interviews were undertaken with individuals from aged care and nursing peak bodies/colleges. Interviews were transcribed, and thematic analysis was undertaken using NVivo 12 software.
   Results: Major themes emerging from the interviews included a sense that attitudes around staff vaccination are changing; the persistence of administrative and resource barriers; the importance of positive workplace culture towards influenza vaccination; and the need for individualised and personal communication strategies. Perspectives were diverse on the necessity of introducing stronger policies, with participants divided in their support mandatory influenza vaccinations. Some advocated that key performance indicators should be used as an alternative to vaccine mandates.
   Conclusions: This study provides policy makers with useful insights into the current Australian context around occupational vaccination policies, to inform acceptable and effective strategies to improve influenza vaccination uptake among Australian hospital and aged care staff.

AB The repeated dose toxicity of a prototype cold chain-free, live, attenuated oral cholera vaccine containing 5 x 10(6) CFU/mL of the VCUSM14P strain was evaluated in Sprague Dawley (SD) rats (single dose administered daily for 30 days) to ascertain its safety for clinical use. Repeated dose toxicity studies for cholera vaccines in the literature have administered 2 or 3 fixed doses at 7, 14, 21 or 69 day intervals. The present study reports an evaluation of 30 repeated doses of cholera vaccine administered at three different concentrations (Group II (1.25 x 10(6) CFU), Group III (2.5 x 10(6) CFU) and Group IV (5 x 10(6) CFU)) in SD rats. The liquid vaccine was administered orally to the rats with the respective dose every day, and normal saline was administered to the control group (Group I). No significant difference (P> 0.05) was observed in the body weights and biochemical parameters of the rats after 15 and 30 repeated doses compared to those of the control group. However, compared to those of Group I, a significant increase (P < 0.05) in the organ to body weight ratios of the lungs, ureter, liver, kidney, heart and spleen was found in G-II, G-III and G-IV. In the haematological analysis, a significant increase in the WBC was observed in G-II and G-IV compared to that in G-I. The histopathological findings indicated mild to moderate degeneration in the liver, kidney, heart and spleen in the treated rats. Mild to moderate lymphocytic infiltration in the lungs was observed in the G-II and G-III rats, and severe infiltration was observed in the G-IV rats. These histopathological findings may be attributed to the 30 doses of vaccine given in daily succession without an interval. In the acute toxicity study, a single dose of vaccine up to 10 x 10(6) CFU did not cause any adverse effects and lethality in SD rats. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Few children living in southwest China are vaccinated against Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae), which is an important pathogen in causing high morbidity and high mortality. This study aimed the molecular characterization of S. pneumoniae strains isolated from children and a new vaccine strategy based on a potential protein antigen.
   Methods: Molecular characterizations, including serotype, virulence gene and pilus analyses, were performed using PCR. Seven housekeeping genes were sequenced to identify the sequence types (STS), and antibiotic resistance was analysed using the microdilution broth method. In addition, we evaluated the protective effects of recombinant plasmin- and fibronectin-binding protein A (rPfbA) in murine pneumococcal infection models by challenge and passive transfer analyses, and assessed cytokine changes after immunization.
   Results: The prevalent serotypes were 19F (31.4%),19A (21.6%), 6B (13.7%), 14 (11.8%) and 23F (9.8%), and the coverage rates of the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) were high in 93.3% of the isolates. The predominant STS were ST271 (23.5%), ST320 (21.6%) and ST876 (11.8%). Most of the S. pneumoniae isolates were resistant to erythromycin (95.1%) and clindamycin (90.2%). The molecular distributions and antibiotic resistance rates of the S. pneumoniae isolates differed between the plateau and the basin regions. More than 93% of the S. pneumoniae isolates carried ply, cbpA, phtD and nanA, and over half of the isolates carried pilus-1, pilus-2 and pfbA. Mucosal immunization with rPfbA induced pneumococcal specific antibody responses which provided to eliminate colonization in lung and nasopharynx, and protection against pneumococcal challenge.
   Conclusion: Vaccine strategies based on epidemiological surveillance can be more adaptive to specific areas, reduce costs and protect against changing antigenic sites. We advise that children currently living in southwest China be vaccinated with PCV13. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Measles elimination efforts are primarily focused on achieving and maintaining national vaccination coverage goals, based on estimates of the critical vaccination threshold (V-c): the proportion of the population that must be immune to prevent sustained epidemics. Traditionally, V-c estimates assume evenly mixing populations, an invalid assumption. If susceptible individuals preferentially contact one another, communities may remain vulnerable to epidemics even when vaccination coverage targets are met at the national level. Here we present a simple method to estimate V-c and the effective reproductive number, R, while accounting for spatial clustering of susceptibility. For measles, assuming R-0 = 15 and 95% population immunity, adjustment for high clustering of susceptibility increases R from 0.75 to 1.29, V-c from 93% to 96%, and outbreak probability after a single introduction from <1% to 23%. The impact of clustering remains minimal until vaccination coverage nears elimination levels. We illustrate our approach using Demographic and Health Survey data from Tanzania and show how non-vaccination clustering potentially contributed to continued endemic transmission of measles virus during the last two decades. Our approach demonstrates why high national vaccination coverage sometimes fails to achieve measles elimination, and that a shift from national to subnational focus is needed as countries approach elimination.

AB Background: California's Senate Bill 277 (SB-277) law eliminated the personal belief exemption to school immunization requirements. A potential consequence may be that parents choose homeschooling to avoid immunization. Vaccine attitudes and behaviors have not been well studied among the homeschooling population. This study explored the effect of SB-277 and vaccine decision-making among California home schoolers.
   Methods: Purposive and snowball sampling were used recruit home-schooling parents through homeschooling Facebook groups based on home school type in high-exemption regions in California for in-depth interviews. Participants had to have a child in a legalized form of homeschooling in California in grades kindergarten-twelfth grade.
   Results: Twenty-four mothers were interviewed. Participants were categorized based on self-reported vaccine attitudes and behavior into three groups: Confident and Accepting, Hesitant and Accepting, and Skeptical and Refusing. All reported the belief that SB-277 is an infringement on parental rights but was not currently impacting them. Confident and Accepting mothers (n = 10) generally believed vaccinations were safe, effective, and posed a lower risk than vaccine preventable disease (VPD). Hesitant and Accepting mothers (n = 5) expressed varying confidence levels in the belief that vaccinations were safe and effective, were not confident in the belief that vaccination posed lower risks than VPD risk, and risk perception affected vaccine decision-making. Skeptical and Refusing mothers (n = 9) generally believed that vaccinations were unsafe and ineffective, refused select vaccines, believed that vaccination posed a more serious risk than VPD risks, and belief of vaccine harm was a salient factor in vaccine decision-making.
   Conclusion: Home-schooling mothers were concerned about SB-277 but did not report that it was directly impacting their children, their vaccine decisions, or reason to home school. Vaccine attitudes and beliefs among homeschooling mothers broadly fell into categories similar to parents of non-home-schooled children. Future quantitative studies should measure vaccine hesitancy and refusal prevalence and potential confounders. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A 16 week newborn vaccinated with bOPV 4 weeks after his first routine IPV vaccination. Nineteen days later, asymmetrical paralysis was developed on his legs, and it was diagnosed to be VAPP. Perianal abscess is suspected to be a risk factor based on some limited results of retrospective studies in China. This is a risk factor similar to the multiple intramuscular injections found by researchers in last century. The two risk factors remind us that, apart from the routine infection route of the fecal to mouth and intestinal tract, skin injury (ulceration) exposure pathway should not be ignored as another possible way of causing polio, for the local injury and lesions of the skin may increase the possibility of oral poliovirus vaccine's entry into the body. As a result, to further reduce the incidence of VAPP, bOPV should be avoided for perianal abscess. If there is perianal abscess, skin injury, or if injection is unavoidable after bOPV vaccination of an infant, much attention should be paid to the treatment and cleaning of infant feces.

   effectiveness; Surveillance; Primary health care
ID TEST-NEGATIVE DESIGN; AUSTRALIA; PCR
AB Background: To support timely, annual estimation of influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE), we explored the use of automated data extraction from general practice records to estimate VE over four consecutive southern hemisphere influenza seasons.
   Methods: A software tool installed at 130 practices in Western Australia identified all outpatients tested for influenza by polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) during annual influenza seasons occurring 2012-2015. Laboratory test results were collated with any existing record of influenza vaccine administered in the same year; limited patient demographic and clinical information was also collected. A case test-negative control analysis compared the odds of seasonal influenza vaccination between patients positive or negative for influenza by PCR with VE =1 - the odds ratio.
   Results: A total of 7270 influenza PCR test results were identified of which 1907 (26.2%) were positive; 9.4% of patients with a positive result had received contemporaneous influenza vaccination >= 14 days prior to specimen collection, compared to 17.9% of those with a negative result. Overall VE was 52% (95% CI, 43-60%); annual VE estimates ranged from 46% (95% CI, 22-63%) in 2012 to 60% (95% CI, 41-73%) in 2014.
   Conclusion: Electronic records routinely maintained by general practice provide a promising opportunity for estimating annual influenza VE in a timely and resource-efficient manner. Crown Copyright (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB "Cross-reactivity" (the observed immune response against pathogen types not specifically targeted by the vaccine antigen composition) and "cross-protection" (clinical protection against related non-vaccine microorganism types) are vaccinology concepts that are attracting renewed interest in the context of disease prevention. National health authorities are collecting mounting evidence of the importance of cross reactivity. For some vaccines, this has been substantiated by cross-protection data from clinical studies and/or post-licensure data, where their introduction into immunization programmes has shown beneficial impacts on disease caused by related non-vaccine microorganisms. This knowledge has influenced the way new vaccines are designed, developed, and evaluated in real-life settings. Some of the new vaccines are now designed with the specific aim of having a greater breadth of protection. Ideal vaccine antigens therefore include epitopes with conserved homology across related pathogen types, because it is not always possible to include the antigens of all the individual types of a given pathogen species. The use of novel adjuvants with greater immunostimulatory properties can also contribute to improved overall vaccine cross-reactivity, as could the use of antigen delivery platforms. The growing body of evidence allows us to better understand the full impact of vaccines - beyond vaccine-type disease - which should be taken into consideration when assessing the full value of vaccination programmes.

AB Introduction: Although FDA approved for over 10 years, uptake of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination has been slow, particularly among states in the Deep South with high cervical cancer incidence and mortality. The purpose of this study was to explore variables associated with cervical cancer among survivors who were age-eligible for the HPV vaccine and to assess HPV vaccination history, barriers, perceptions, and other associated behaviors within this cohort.
   Methods: A mixed methods strategy was used for the study, first identifying eligible cervical cancer survivors from our institution and abstracting demographic and clinicopathologic medical record data. Twenty-three participants from this cohort then completed semi-structured qualitative telephone interviews regarding HPV vaccination participation, knowledge, and attitudes. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic content analysis.
   Results: Of the 464 cervical cancer patients treated at our institution from 2011 to 2016, 137 (30%) were under age 40 at diagnosis. Seventy-seven women with invasive disease were identified (median age = 33 years), and 56% had been seen by a gynecologist within 5 years of diagnosis. Forty-six of these women met eligibility criteria for inclusion in the qualitative interview, of which 23 successfully completed (response rate = 50%). Of those interviewed, the majority (84%) reported current access to regular medical care. While 90.9% did not receive any doses of HPV vaccination, 78.3% stated they likely would have been vaccinated if it had it been recommended. Four major themes were identified within the interviews: HPV knowledge, vaccine acceptability, healthcare engagement, and provider communication.
   Conclusions: Qualitative interviews revealed significant missed opportunities for prevention since most participants stated they would have been vaccinated if given the option. Substantial gaps in knowledge and mixed understanding HPV's association with cervical cancer were observed, demonstrating potential missed opportunities for education and communication between providers of multiple specialties and their patients.

AB Morbidity from vaccine-preventable diseases is high in India, but precise estimates of vaccination timeliness are difficult to compute because many children lack records of vaccination dates. This study assessed vaccination timeliness after accounting for right and left censoring of data. This cross-sectional study used the 2012-2013 District Level Household and Facility Survey in India. The outcome was vaccination timeliness for 9 vaccine doses: 1 dose Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), 4 doses oral polio vaccine, 3 doses diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus vaccine (DPT), and 1 dose measles-containing vaccine. Age-specific probabilities of vaccination were calculated using Turnbull estimators: children not yet vaccinated were right censored, and children vaccinated but without a recorded date were left censored. Data from 108,783 children under 5 years were available. For children 25-60 months, maternal recall was a more common source of information than a vaccination record with dates. At one month past the recommended vaccination age, estimated coverage ranged from 35% for DPT-3 to 55% for BCG. Accounting for censored data improved vaccination timeliness measures, and demonstrated little increase in vaccination coverage after age one. Efforts to reduce morbidity from vaccine-preventable diseases in India should focus on eliminating missed opportunities for vaccination and instituting special vaccination programs for older children.

AB Background: Deaths attributable to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) among adults are estimated to exceed 11,000 annually, and annual adult hospitalizations for influenza and RSV may be comparable. RSV vaccines for older adults are in development. We assessed the following among primary care physicians (PCPs) who treat adults: (1) perception of RSV disease burden; (2) current RSV testing practices; and (3) anticipated barriers to adoption of an RSV vaccine.
   Methods: We administered an Internet and mail survey from February to March 2017 to national networks of 930 PCPs.
   Results: The response rate was 67% (620/930). Forty-nine percent of respondents (n = 303) were excluded from analysis as they reported never or rarely caring for an adult patient with possible RSV in the past year. Among respondents who reported taking care of RSV patients (n = 317), 73% and 57% responded that in patients >= 50 years, influenza is generally more severe than RSV and that they rarely consider RSV as a potential pathogen, respectively. Most (61%) agreed that they do not test for RSV because there is no treatment. The most commonly reported anticipated barriers to a RSV vaccine were potential outof-pocket expenses for patients if the vaccine is not covered by insurance (93%) and lack of reimbursement for vaccination (74%).
   Conclusions: Physicians reported little experience with RSV disease in adults. They are generally not testing for it and the majority believe that influenza disease is more severe. Physicians will require more information about RSV disease burden in adults and the potential need for a vaccine in their adult patients. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Lymphatic filariasis causes global morbidity. Wolbachia, an endo-symbiotic intracellular bacterium of the filarial nematode helps in their growth and development, regulates fecundity in female worms and contributes to the immunopathogenesis of the disease. However, genes and proteins of Wolbachia that may act as putative vaccine candidates are not known. In this study, we cloned recombinase-A protein of Wolbachia from Brugia malayi (wBmRecA) and carried out its detailed biochemical and immunological characterization. Bioinformatics analysis, circular dichroism and fluorescence spectral studies showed significant sequence and structural similarities between wBmRecA and RecA of other alpha-proteo- bacterial species. wBmRecA was ubiquitously expressed in all the three major life stages of B. malayi, including excretory-secretory products of the adult worm. In silico studies suggested immunogenic potential of wBmRecA, and mice immunized with wBmRecA exhibited elevated levels of immunoglobulins IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b and IgG3 in their serum along with increased percentages of CD4+ , CD8(+) T cells and CD19(+) B cells in their spleens. Notably, splenocytes from immunized mice showed increased m-RNA expression of T-bet, elevated proinflammatory cytokines IFN-gamma and IL-12, while peritoneal Meis exhibited increased levels of iNOS, downregulated Arg-1 and secreted copious amounts of nitric oxide which contributed to severely impaired development of the infective larvae (Bm-L3). Interestingly, sera from immunized mice promoted significant cellular adherence and cytotoxicity against microfilariae and Bm-L3. Importantly, wBmRecA demonstrated strong immuno-reactivity with bancroftian sera from endemic normal individuals. These results suggest that wBmRecA is highly immunogenic, and should be explored further as a putative vaccine candidate against lymphatic filariasis. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Immunogenicity and safety of intradermal delivery of hepatitis B booster
   vaccine using the novel drug delivery device VAX-ID (TM)
SO VACCINE
LA English
DT Article
DE Hepatitis B vaccine; Intradermal; Intramuscular; Booster; Device
ID ADULTS; OPTIONS
AB Background: Although intramuscular (IM) injection is still the most preferred method for vaccination, intradermal (ID) delivery may have several advantages over intramuscular and subcutaneous (SC), including an improved immune response and antigen dose sparing effect. However it is currently limited due to the difficulty in standardizing the injection technique often based on the Mantoux technique. Difficulties encountered using the Mantoux technique could be overcome by the use of alternative ID delivery systems that confer more uniform and standardized procedures.
   The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of a newly developed intradermal injection device, VAX-ID (TM), via a proof-of-concept to assess the immunogenicity of a commercially available hepatitis B booster vaccination in healthy hepatitis B pre-immunised subjects. Additionally, device safety and tolerability was evaluated.
   Materials and methods: Three different routes of administration were compared over 4 groups, each receiving hepatitis B vaccine antigen: (1) standard IM injection in the deltoid region (HBVAXPRO (R) 10 mu g/1 ml), (2) ID injection in the proximal posterior area of the forearm according to the Mantoux technique, (3) with VAX-ID (TM) in one forearm, or (4) with VAX-ID (TM) in both forearms. For ID injections 0.11 cc, of which 0.01 cc is overfill, was drawn from a vial containing HBVAXPRO (R) 40 mu g/1 ml. Immunogenicity and safety were followed-up at day 0, 14, 30 and 210.
   Results: A total of 48 subjects were included. All subjects showed an anamnestic response at 14 days post booster vaccination. Elevated titres persisted until end of follow-up at day 210. For the ID groups a 3 fold higher immune response at day 14 and day 30 was recorded compared to IM group. Local adverse events were more reported for ID compared to IM.
   Conclusions: The investigated ID injection device VAX-ID (TM) proves to be a good alternative to offer ID vaccination. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Rotavirus diarrhea is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in young children in both developed and developing countries. Hospitalization costs are a significant burden of both governments and households. The objective of this study was to estimate the economic burden associated with the hospitalization of children with non-rotavirus and rotavirus diarrhea in two provinces in Thailand.
   Method: A prospective incidence-based cost-of-illness study was conducted on children under five years old with acute diarrhea who had been admitted to public hospitals in two provinces during October 2012 and June 2013. Caregivers were interviewed to estimate costs from a societal perspective at 2014 values. Stool samples were examined for rotavirus antigens. Multivariate regression analysis was used to assess the relationship of predictor variables to costs. Annual economic burden of rotavirus hospitalization was estimated by multiplying the number of hospitalized children and the hospitalization cost per episode. The costs were converted to international dollars (I$) using purchasing power parity (PPP) (1 USD = 12.36 baht for the year 2014).
   Results: Seven hundred and eighty-eight cases of acute diarrhea were included in the analysis. Of the total, one hundred and ninety-seven (25%) were detected as being rotavirus positive. Total societal costs of inpatient care per episode were 822.68 USD (10,165 Baht). The average costs of children with and without rotavirus were 903.39 USD (11,162 Baht) and 795.40 USD (9,827 Baht), respectively. Based on the multiple regression analysis, rotavirus infection, severity, and younger age were significantly associated with the higher costs.
   Conclusion: Diarrhea, rotavirus diarrhea in particular, represents of a substantial economic burden in the society in Thailand. The accurate estimates that societal costs of the rotavirus diarrhea hospitalizations provide valuable input for considering a preventive program. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination is expected to reduce HPV-related disease and cancer in the US. However, many parents are hesitant to obtain the vaccine for their children. The purpose of this study is to examine how the reasons for refusing the HPV vaccine vary across regions of the US, across time, and by race/ethnicity.
   Methods: This study used data on 13-17 year old adolescents collected by the National Immunization Survey - Teen (NIS-Teen) annually between 2008 and 2016. We evaluated the frequencies of parents who did not intend to vaccinate their children in the next year among unvaccinated children. Among these non-intenders, we evaluated how reasons for HPV vaccine hesitancy changed across time, by region of the US, and race/ethnicity.
   Results: The proportion of non-intenders among unvaccinated decreased from 72% in 2010 to 58% in 2016. The most frequent reason for vaccine hesitancy was that parents felt HPV vaccination was not necessary (22.4%), followed by lack of provider recommendation (16.2%), and lack of knowledge (15.6%). Lack of provider recommendation increased in frequency as a reason for HPV vaccine hesitancy until 2012, then decreased in frequency through 2016. Cost was one reason that was elevated in all regions compared to the Northeast. Black non-intenders were less likely to report safety, costs, or their children's fear as reasons for not intending to vaccinate their children compared to white non-intenders. Hispanic non-intenders were more likely to report lack of knowledge and that the vaccine is not a school requirement as reasons not to vaccinate their children compared to white non-intenders.
   Conclusions: National advocacy for improving provider recommendation for HPV vaccination likely contributed to a sharp decline in HPV vaccine hesitancy due to lack of provider recommendation. Results indicate the need for multifaceted interventions to increase HPV vaccination. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: The public health burden of Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is high but no vaccine is specifically approved to prevent ETEC infections.
   Methods: We performed a Phase 1, dose escalation study (1-50 mu g) evaluating the sublingual (SL) delivery of the double mutant heat-labile toxin LTR192G/L211A (dmLT) in 80 healthy adult volunteers. The primary objective was safety and the secondary was the immunogenicity of the dmLT. Subjects received 3 doses of dmLT at days 1,15, and 29. Subjects receiving the first dose at each dosage level were observed overnight in a research facility. The second and third doses were administered on an outpatient basis. Data from cohorts 1-4 were used to select the cohort 5 dose (25 mu g), comparing SL and oral routes.
   Results: The vaccine appeared safe and well tolerated with only rare development of vomiting or diarrhea. The serum anti-dmLT IgA and IgG and neutralizing antibody responses were modest after any of the SL immunizations. Serum IgA and IgG titers were increased at the higher antigen doses (25 or 50 mu g) but the percent with 4-fold increases was at best 38% for both IgA and IgG. The 4-fold increase among subjects receiving all 3 doses was 43% for both IgA and IgG. Antibody titers following oral administration were, in general, significantly higher than after SL. The frequency of IgA- or IgG-ASCs in circulation were somewhat vaccine dose dependent and were detected at a moderate level. However, antibodies in saliva or stool were rarely detected. Post-vaccination increases in T cells or cytokine production were also infrequent.
   Conclusion: The dmLT vaccine formulation evaluated here was safe but only moderately immunogenic at doses up to 50 mu g when administered by the SL or oral route. Studies at higher doses with better formulations appear warranted. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We reported previously that a synthetic mucosal adjuvant SF-10, which mimics human pulmonary surfactant, delivers antigen to mucosal dendritic cells in the nasal cavity and promotes induction of humoral and cellular immunity. The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of oral administration of antigen combined with SF-10 (antigen-SF-10) on systemic and local immunity. Oral administration of ovalbumin, a model antigen, combined with SF-10 enhanced ovalbumin uptake into intestinal antigen presenting MHC II(+)CD11c(+) cells and their CD11b(+)CD103(+) and CD11b(+)CD103(-) subtype dendritic cells, which are the major antigen presenting subsets of the intestinal tract, more efficiently compared to without SF-10. Oral vaccination with influenza hemagglutinin vaccine (HAv)-SF-10 induced HAv-specific IgA and IgG in the serum, and HAv-specific secretory IgA and IgG in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, nasal washes, gastric extracts and fecal material; their levels were significantly higher than those induced by subcutaneous HAv or intranasal HAv and HAv-SF-10 vaccinations. Enzyme-linked immunospot assay showed high numbers of HAv-specific IgA and IgG antibody secreting cells in the gastrointestinal and respiratory mucosal lymphoid tissues after oral vaccination with HAv-SF-10, but no or very low induction following oral vaccination with HAv alone. Oral vaccination with HAv-SF-10 provided protective immunity against severe influenza A virus infection, which was significantly higher than that induced by HAv combined with cholera toxin. Oral vaccination with HAv-SF-10 was associated with unique cytokine production patterns in the spleen after HAv stimulation; including marked induction of HAv-responsive Th17 cytokines (e.g., IL-17A and IL-22), high induction of Th1 cytokines (e.g., IL-2 and IFN-gamma) and moderate induction of Th2 cytokines (e.g., IL-4 and IL-5). These results indicate that oral vaccination with HAv-SF-10 induces more efficient systemic and local immunity than nasal or subcutaneous vaccination with characteristically high levels of secretory HAv-specific IgA in various mucosal organs and protective immunity.

ID CHILDREN; BURDEN; STATE
AB Background: World Health Organization has recommended the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) in the childhood immunisation programme of all the countries in the world. In lieu of its introduction in India, there is a need to generate evidence on cost-effectiveness of this vaccine. The current study looks into the impact and cost-effectiveness of PCV vaccine in India.
   Methods: We evaluated the cost effectiveness of implementation of PCV 13 vaccination program at national level by comparing with no vaccination program for a period of 10 birth cohorts from 2018 to 2027. UNIVAC, a deterministic static cohort model is developed by giving the conservative estimates of vaccine program related to mortality, disease event rates, vaccine efficacy and coverage projections, system and health care costs for the first five years of life. Cost effectiveness is reported as Incremental Cost Effectiveness Ratio (ICER). Further scenario and sensitivity analysis were done. Probability of PCV intervention to be cost effective at a willingness to pay (WTP) threshold equal to per capita gross domestic product (GDP) is calculated using the government perspective.
   Results: We found that the introduction of PCV vaccination program can cost an additional $467 (INR 31,666) for averting per DALY which is less than one time GDP per capita of India. Even with the most unfavourable scenario for PCV vaccine, cost per DALY averted is found to be $2323 (INR 1,57,520) which is still a cost effective intervention in India. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis found the ICER for PCV to be $649 (INR 44,008) with 95% CI: $374-$1161.
   Conclusion: This study shows that the PCV program is a highly cost effective intervention and justifies the introduction of PCV into routine immunisation schedule in some of the states and recommends introducing it throughout the country to reduce morbidity and mortality among the under-five children.

AB Objective: To determine the effect of a prescription order requirement for pharmacist-administered zoster vaccination on zoster vaccination in adults aged 60+.
   Methods: A 50-state law review of statutes and regulations regarding pharmacists' ability to administer the zoster vaccine with/without a prescription order was performed. States were classified as prescription order required or not required as of January 1, 2014. Data on adults aged 60+ were obtained from the 2014 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). Chi-square tests and multilevel logistic regression models with and without propensity scores methods were used.
   Results: Of the 50 states, 39 and the District of Columbia did not require a prescription order. After propensity score matching, zoster vaccination rates for adults ages 60 and older were significantly higher in states that did not require a prescription order (23.0% vs 21.1%, p = 0.0022). The propensity score-matched multilevel logistic regression model for adults aged 60+ found modestly higher odds of HZ vaccination for states that removed the prescription order requirement (OR 1.17, 95% CI 1.01-1.35). Similar estimates were found across other methodologies employed and age strata, although statistical significance varied.
   Conclusions: Prescription order requirements are associated with HZ vaccination rates. By removing a prescription order requirement, states may be able to promote increases in HZ vaccination in adults aged 60+. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID VACCINE; CONTAINER; SINGLE; IMPACT
AB Background: Frequently, a country will procure a single vaccine vial size, but the question remains whether tailoring the use of different size vaccine vial presentations based on populations or location characteristics within a single country could provide additional benefits, such as reducing open vial wastage (OVW) or reducing missed vaccination opportunities.
   Methods: Using the Highly Extensible Resource for Modeling Supply Chains (HERMES) software, we built a simulation model of the Zambia routine vaccine supply chain. At baseline, we distributed 10-dose Measles-Rubella (MR) vials to all locations, and then distributed 5-dose and 1-dose MR vials to (1) all locations, (2) rural districts, (3) rural health facilities, (4) outreach sites, and (5) locations with average MR session sizes <5 and <10 children. We ran sensitivity on each scenario using MR vial opening thresholds of 0% and 50%, i.e. a healthcare worker opens an MR vaccine for any number of children (0%) or if at least half will be used (50%).
   Results: Replacing 10-dose MR with 5-dose MR vials everywhere led to the largest reduction in MR OVW, saving 573,892 doses (103,161 doses with the 50% vial opening threshold) and improving MR availability by 1% (9%). This scenario, however, increased cold chain utilization and led to a 1% decrease in availability of other vaccines. Tailoring 5-dose MR vials to rural health facilities or based on average session size reduced cold transport constraints, increased total vaccine availability (+1%) and reduced total cost per dose administered (-$0.01) compared to baseline.
   Conclusions: In Zambia, tailoring 5-dose MR vials to rural health facilities or by average session size results in the highest total vaccine availability compared to all other scenarios (regardless of OVT policy) by reducing open vial wastage without increasing cold chain utilization.

DE Delivery; Logistics; Microneedle patch; Supply chain
ID IMPACT
AB Background: Microneedle patch (MNP) technology is designed to simplify the process of vaccine administration; however, depending on its characteristics, MNP technology may provide additional benefits beyond the point-of-use, particularly for vaccine supply chains.
   Methods: Using the HERMES modeling software, we examined replacing four routine vaccines - Measles-containing vaccine (MCV), Tetanus toxoid (TT), Rotavirus (Rota) and Pentavalent (Penta) - with MNP versions in the routine vaccine supply chains of Benin, Bihar (India), and Mozambique.
   Results: Replacing MCV with an MNP (5 cm 3 -per-dose, 2-month thermostability, current single-dose price-per-dose) improved MCV availability by 13%, 1% and 6% in Benin, Bihar and Mozambique, respectively, and total vaccine availability by 1% in Benin and Mozambique, while increasing the total cost per dose administered by $0.07 in Benin, $0.56 in Bihar and $0.11 in Mozambique. Replacing TT with an MNP improved TT and total vaccine availability (3% and <1%) in Mozambique only, when the patch was 5 cm(3) and 2-months thermostable but increased total cost per dose administered by $0.14. Replacing Rota with an MNP (at 5-15 cm(3)-per-dose, 1-2 month thermostable) improved Rota and total vaccine availability, but only improved Rota vaccine availability in Bihar (at 5 cm(3), 1-2 months thermostable), while decreasing total vaccine availability by 1%. Finally, replacing Penta with an MNP (at 5 cm(3), 2-months thermostable) improved Penta vaccine availability by 1-8% and total availability by <1-9%.
   Conclusions: An MNP for MCV, TT, Rota, or Penta would need to have a smaller or equal volume-per-dose than existing vaccine formulations and be able to be stored outside the cold chain for a continuous period of at least two months to provide additional benefits to all three supply chains under modeled conditions.

AB Bacterial flagellin activates the innate immune system and ultimately the adaptive immune system through a Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5)-dependent signaling mechanism. Given that TLR5 is widely distributed in epithelia, flagellin is currently being developed as a mucosal adjuvant. Flagellin FliC from Salmonella enterica has four domains: the conserved D0 and D1 domains and the hypervariable D2 and D3 domains. The deletion of D3 and partial deletion of D2 in the recombinant FliC(Delta 174-400) strongly impairs flagellin's intrinsic antigenicity but does not affect the TLR5-dependent immunostimulation activity, i.e., the capacity to promote innate responses and adaptive responses to co-administered antigens. Here, we describe the development of novel recombinant flagellins with various deletions encompassing all of D2 and D3, and part of D1. Most of the recombinant molecules conserved an alpha-helical secondary structure that was as resistant to heat denaturation as the native protein. Whereas the recombinant flagellins' ability to trigger TLR5 varied markedly in vitro, most gave equivalent in vivo TLR5-dependent innate immune responses following intranasal administration of 2 mu g of flagellin to mice. Concordantly, the recombinant flagellins were also valuable respiratory adjuvants for eliciting antibody responses to the foreign antigen ovalbumin, although their intrinsic antigenicity was decreased compared to the native flagellin and not increased compared to FliC(Delta 174-400). Our results show that the additional deletions of D2 and the distal part of D1 of FliC(Delta 174-400) does not impact on antigenicity and does not significantly modify the immunostimulatory adjuvant activity. Altogether, this study generated a novel set of recombinant flagellin that constitutes a portfolio of TLR5-dependent candidate adjuvants for vaccination. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Vaccines for prevention and treatment of genital herpes are high public health priorities. Our approach towards vaccine development is to focus on blocking virus entry mediated by herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) glycoprotein D (gD2) and to prevent the virus from evading complement and antibody attack by blocking the immune evasion domains on HSV-2 glycoproteins C (gC2) and E (gE2), respectively. HSV-2 gC2 and gE2 are expressed on the virion envelope and infected cell surface where they are potential targets of antibodies that bind and block their immune evasion activities. We demonstrate that antibodies produced during natural infection in humans or intravaginal inoculation in guinea pigs bind to gC2 but generally fail to block the immune evasion domains on this glycoprotein. In contrast, immunization of naive or previously HSV-2-infected guinea pigs with gC2 subunit antigen administered with CpG and alum as adjuvants produces antibodies that block domains involved in immune evasion. These results indicate that immune evasion domains on gC2 are weak antigens during infection, yet when used as vaccine immunogens with adjuvants the antigens produce antibodies that block immune evasion domains.

AB Background: In the US, Meningococcal B (MenB) vaccines were first licensed in 2014. In 2015, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended that parents of teens talk to their provider about receiving MenB vaccine, rather than issuing a routine recommendation. We assessed parental awareness of MenB vaccines and willingness to vaccinate their teens with MenB vaccines compared to MenACWY vaccines, which have been routinely recommended for many years.
   Methods: We surveyed parents of teens attending high school in 2017-18 during the Minnesota State Fair. Parents reported via iPad their knowledge of and concern about meningococcal disease and their awareness of and willingness to vaccinate with MenB and MenACWY vaccines. We assessed the relationship between meningococcal disease knowledge and concern, MenB and MenACWY vaccine awareness, and willingness to vaccinate with MenB and MenACWY using adjusted logistic regression.
   Results: Among 445 parents, the majority had not heard of the newly introduced MenB vaccines Bexsero (R) (80.0%; 95% CI: 76.0-83.6) or Trumenba (R) (82.0%; 95% CI: 78.1-85.5) or the MenACWY vaccines Menactra (R) or Menveo (R) (68.8%; 95% CI: 64.2-73.0). The majority were at least somewhat willing to vaccinate their teen with MenB vaccine (89.6%; 95% CI: 86.5, 92.3) and MenACWY vaccine (91.2%; 95% CI: 88.2, 93.7). Awareness of MenB vaccines (OR: 3.8; 95% CI: 1.2-12.2) and concern about meningococcal disease (OR: 3.1; 95% CI: 1.5-6.3) were significantly associated with willingness to vaccinate with MenB vaccine.
   Conclusions: Awareness of MenB vaccine is lacking among parents of teens but is an important predictor of willingness to vaccinate with the newly licensed MenB vaccines. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Levansucrase (EC 2.1.4.10, LS) has been used in the production of levan and levan-type fructooligosaccharides from sucrose; however, development of further application is restricted due to its poor thermostability. The LS from Brenneria sp. EniD312 was engineered using a structure-guided approach. Residue Glu(404) was located in the "-TEAP-" motif and varied among LSs with different thermostabilities. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed in Glu(404) and thermostability was evaluated by measuring the half-life and structural melting temperature (T-m) of the wild-type LS and its Glu(404)-mutant variants. The optimal temperature for the Glu(404)" mutants was similar to that of the wild-type enzyme, however, the T-m of E404 L mutant was enhanced by 2.8 degrees C and the half-life was increased by 12.5- and 1.3- fold at 35 and 45 degrees C, respectively. The other mutants E404 W, E404 V, E4041, and E404 F also showed a pronounced increase in T-m and thermostability. Finally, the improvement of thermostability of LS through mutation in Glu(404) belonging to the "-TEAP"- motif could be ascribed to the change of microenvironment in the LS structure. The change of the micro-environment mainly included the enhanced structural stability between two beta-hairpins and the elevated hydrophobic interactions in the overall protein structure. This work proposes new insights into the thermostabilization mechanism of other LSs.

AB Yarrowia lipolytica has been used to produce both citric acid and lipid-based bioproducts at high titers. In this study, we found that pH differentially affects citric acid and lipid production in Y. lipolytica W29, with citric acid production enhanced at more neutral pH's and lipid production enhanced at more acid pH's. To determine the mechanism governing this pH-dependent switch between citric acid and lipid production, we profiled gene expression at different pH's and found that the relative expression of multiple transporters is increased at neutral pH. These results suggest that this pH-dependent switch is mediated at the level of citric acid transport rather than changes in the expression of the enzymes involved in citric acid and lipid metabolism. In further support of this mechanism, thermodynamic calculations suggest that citric acid secretion is more energetically favorable at neutral pH's, assuming the fully protonated acid is the substrate for secretion. Collectively, these results provide new insights regarding citric acid and lipid production in Y. lipolytica and may offer new strategies for metabolic engineering and process design.

AB The por1 gene encoding one of the mitochondrial porin channels in C. utilis CCTCC M 209298 was disrupted using a homologous recombination method. The co-production of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and glutathione (GSH) in the mutant C. utilis Delta por1 increased by 34.9% and 25.1%, respectively, during batch and fed-batch fermentation, relative to the parental strain. The average oxygen consumption rate, activities of key enzymes involved in SAM and GSH biosynthesis, levels of intracellular cofactors such as NADH and ATP, and carbon fluxes of key metabolites were compared between the parental strain and the Delta por1 mutant. The disruption of por1 gene increased the rate of mitochondrial respiration, increased the activities of both methionine adeno- syltransferase and gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase, and enhanced the supply of energy and substrates for SAM and GSH biosynthesis, all of which favored the overproduction of SAM and GSH in the Delta por1 mutant.

AB Chiral beta-amino alcohols are very important chiral building block for preparing bioactive compounds for use in pharmaceutical and fine chemical industries. Synthesis of chiral beta-amino alcohols by transaminase is big challenging due to the strict substrate specificities and very low activity of the enzyme. In this work, a (R)-selective omega-transaminase (MVTA) from Mycobacterium vanbaalenii was employed as a biocatalyst for the first time for the synthesis of chiral beta-amino alcohol via kinetic resolution and asymmetric reductive amination. The enzyme was purified and characterized. Kinetic resolution of a set of racemic beta-amino alcohols including two cyclic beta-amino alcohols by MVTA was demonstrated, affording (R)-beta-amino alcohols, (1S, 2S)-trans-2-aminocyclopentanol and (1R, 2S)-cis-1-amino-2-indanols in > 99% ee and 50-62% conversion. Asymmetric reductive amination of three alpha-hydroxy ketones (10-300 mM) by MVTA was conducted, (S)-beta-amino alcohols were obtained with > 99% ee and 80-99% conversion. Preparation experiment for the reductive amination of 200 mM 2-hydroxyacetophenone by the resting cells of re- combinant E. coli (MVTA) was proceeded smoothly and product (S)-2-amino-2-phenylethanol was obtained with 71% isolated yield, > 99% ee and 68.6 g/L/d volumetric productivity. The current research proved that the MVTA is a robust enzyme for the preparation of chiral beta-amino alcohol with high volumetric productivity.

AB Recombinant protein production by various host organisms is strictly regulated, which is determined mainly by host cell genetics and maintenance of process variables within desirable limits in a reactor. Since the process dynamics typically exhibit nonlinear interactions amongst the critical process variables, the commonly employed controllers are suboptimal for control of most bioprocesses. In this article, we present the implementation of an augmented controller for improving the production of recombinant human serum albumin (rHSA) using Pichia pastoris. The augmented controller consists of a decoupled adaptive control (DAC) and a decoupled input-output linearizing control (DIOLC) in a combined architecture that permits simultaneous control of substrate concentration and dissolved oxygen concentration, sampled at different rates during fed-batch fermentation. The performance of DAC-DIOLC controller was compared to the performance of DAC and DIOLC implemented individually on the process. Our results show that the augmented controller better regulates the substrate and dissolved oxygen (DO), along the desired control trajectory compared to the individual DAC and DIOLC controllers. The performance of the augmented DAC-DIOLC controller showed deviations of only 0.021 g/L from substrate set point compared to 0.09 g/L in PID and 0.031 g/L in DIOLC, and a 1.12% deviation from DO set point compared to 11.86% in PID and 2.58% in DAC. Overall, stricter control achieved using the augmented controller resulted in a 1.5 fold increase in rHSA production.

ID ARABINOGALACTAN-PROTEINS; EXPRESSION; INSIGHTS
AB Arabinogalactan proteins are proteoglycans located in the plant cell wall. Most arabinogalactan proteins are composed of carbohydrate moieties of beta-(1 -> 3)-galactan main chains with beta-(1 -> 6)-galactan side chains terminated by other glycans. In this study, three novel endo-beta-(1 -> 3)-galactanases were identified and the substrate specificity was further studied using well-defined galactan oligomers. Linear and branched beta-(1 -> 3)-linked galactans, which resemble the carbohydrate core of the arabinogalactan protein, were used for the characterization of endo-beta-(1 -> 3)-galactanases. The identified enzymes required at least three consecutive galactose residues for activity. Non-substituted regions were preferred, but substituents in the -2 and +2 and in some cases also -1 and +1 subsites were tolerated to some extent, depending on the branching pattern, however at a significantly lower rate/frequency.

AB We report the design and characterization of novel fusion proteins, consisting of the F8 antibody and of murine calreticulin (Calr). The F8 antibody recognizes the alternatively-spliced ED-A domain of fibronectin, an extra-cellular matrix component found in most tumor types, while calreticulin has previously been described as an "eat-me" signal for dendritic cells and phagocytes. Four fusion proteins, differing in antibody formats and peptide linkers, were produced in mammalian cells, purified to homogeneity and tested in vitro and in vivo. A quantitative biodistribution in F9 tumor-bearing mice revealed that the homobivalent F8-F8-Calr format, featuring a tandem diabody structure, had the best tumor-homing properties and, for this reason, this protein was studied in therapy experiments in CT26 tumor-bearing mice. Intravenous administration of F8-F8-Calr led to a tumor growth retardation, which could be further improved by combination with anti-PD1 antibody treatment. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed an increased density of CD8(+) T cells, CD11c(+) dendritic cells and F4/80(+) macrophages in tumor tissue. Even though F8-F8-Calr did not lead to cancer cures at the doses tested, the excellent tolerability profile and the ability to favor a leukocyte infiltration into the neoplastic mass suggests that the targeted delivery of calreticulin may be considered for combination therapy approaches.

AB Biocatalysis has become the main approach to produce cytidine diphosphate choline (CDP-choline), which has been applied for treatment of acute craniocerebral injury and consciousness after brain surgery. However, salt accumulates with the production and inhibits enzyme activity, and eventually reduces yield and product accumulation rate. Our work provided a possible solution to this problem by applying a computational designed halophilic choline kinase. The halotolerant CKI (choline kinase) was designed following a unique strategy considering the most variable residue positions on the protein surface among target enzymes from different sources. The basic and neutral surface residues were replaced with acidic ones. This approach was enlightened by features of natural halophilic enzymes. Mutants in the work represented higher catalytic activities and IC50 (inhibit activity by 50%) at high salt concentrations (over 1200 mM). Furthermore, when the mutant was used in fed-batch production, the CDP-choline accumulation rate doubled comparing with process using wild-type CKI at acetate concentration of over 700 mM. The maximum titer was 151 +/- 3.2 mM, the productivity was 5.8 +/- 0.1 mM.L h(-1), and molar yield to CMP and utilization efficiency of energy were 85.3 and 63.5%. The idea of computational design in our work can also be applied to modify other enzymes in industry, and sheds light on alleviating effect of salt accumulation during industrial manufacturing process.

AB The present paper describes the effect of injection parameters and combustor geometry on performance, emission and combustion characteristics of a turbo-charged diesel (TDI) engine operated in dual fuel mode with calophyllum inophyllum oil methyl ester and babul wood chip generated producer gas. The experimentation were carried out at varied injection timing (IT) (19-24 bTDC), injection pressure (IP) (180-240 bar) in steps of 10 bar and five different combustion chambers (CC) were investigated individually to achieve better performance. Experimental results revealed that at an advanced IT and IP of 24 bTDC and 230 bar, brake thermal efficiency (BTE) showed an overall reduction of 6.35%, while an increment of about 5.68% and 10.88% in brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) and exhaust gas temperature (EGT) respectively. During the emission analysis, carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbon (HC), nitrogen oxide (NOx) and smoke opacity were measured to be 20%, 26.77%, 12.16% and 26.53% lower than conventional fuel. Moreover, toroidal re-entrant combustion chamber (TrCC) was also found to have superior performance, emission and combustion characteristics over the other configurations of combustion chambers. TrCC delivered a performance enhancement of 6.4%, 4.49% and 20.76% in terms of BTE, BSFC and EGT, while and emission level improvement of 34.48%, 33.71% and 38.67% in terms of CO, HC and smoke opacity. However, NOx emission level was deteriorated by 26.66% in compared to standard engine. Based upon the above results, engine with modified TrCC, advanced IT (24 degrees bTDC) and IP (230 bar) enhances the existing performance, emission and combustion characteristics of a TDI engine operated in dual fuel mode, provides freedom from conventional fuel thereby enhancing sustainable energy and its security.

Three approaches viz., acidogenic fermentation (H-AP), electrohydrogenesis (H-MEC) and methanogenesis (M-AD), were evaluated in single stage as well as in different combinations of two stage (H-AF -> H-MEC, H-AP -> M-AD) and three stage (H-AF H-MEC -> M-AD, H-AF -> M-AD -> H-MEC) to tap the maximum feasible energy. Compared to single and two -stage operations, three -stage operation evidenced higher biogas (H-2 + CH4) yield with remarkable total organic carbon (TOC) reduction. Irrespective of the integration sequence, H-AF in first stage depicted the possibility of harnessing higher energy by accumulation of volatile fatty acids (WA) along with H-2 production. Similarly, integration of M-AD in second stage showed the possibility of tapping higher energy rather than H-MEC due to higher carbon loss as CO2 coupled to more H-2 fraction in biogas in case of H-MEC. Among, three -stage integrations, higher biogas yield and energy recovery was observed in H-AF M-AD. H-MEC (38.77 mol biogas/kg TOCR; 25,415 KJ/kg TOCR) as compared to H-AP -> H-MEC -> M-AD (37.79 mol biogas/kg TOCR; 15,416 KJ/kg TOCR). Along similar lines, analysis of organic carbon flow exhibited significant substrate degradation in three stage integrations (72.5-81.4%) as compared to second (66.2-70%) and first stage (39.7-56.5%).

AB The effect of hydrothermal pretreatment (HTP) on the biomass structure and aromatic production in the catalytic co-pyrolysis process was investigated in this study. Fundamental characteristic analysis indicated that HTP removed most of the hemicellulose and some oxygen, enhancing the hydrogen-to-carbon effective ratio (H/Ceff) of biomass. X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and solid-state cross-polarization magic angle spinning carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance analysis revealed that HTP mainly interrupted unstable chemical bonds (acetyl groups, glycosidic bonds, and ether linkage in lignin) and changed the biomass crystallinity. Furthermore, HTP remarkably removed alkalis and alkali earth metals (AAEM) from the biomass. To determine the effect of HTP on co-pyrolysis, individual pyrolysis of raw and pretreated corncob was carried out. Results showed that HTP significantly enhanced yields of levoglucosans and furans, both of which are important intermediates for aromatic formation during co-pyrolysis. HTP remarkably increased the aromatic contents of bio-oil in the co-pyrolysis of different corncob samples and polyethylene. The influence of HTP on aromatic production mainly included AAEM removal, hemicellulose decomposition, furan formation, and H/Ceff increments in the pretreated biomass. Thus, HTP has great potential in improving aromatic production during co pyrolysis of biomass and polyethylene.

AB Transcritical organic Rankine cycle is a great promising technology in the field of energy saving and environ" ment protection. Using trans-1,3,3,3-tetrafluoropropene (R1234ze(E)) as working fluid for low grade waste heat recovery was proposed and studied in this study. The sensitivity analysis was introduced to analyze the influence of multiple parameters on the thermal and exergy efficiencies of cycle. The results showed that the turbine efficiency and temperature of heat source had the most influence on the efficiencies of cycle. On the basis of sensitivity analysis, the parametric analysis and optimization were considered, and the results indicated that the effect of parameters on efficiencies of cycle was changed with the high pressure of cycle, and the best high pressure of cycle was affected by multiple parameters. Furthermore, to maximize the efficiencies of cycle, an accurate prediction model of the best high pressure of cycle considering multiple parameters was established using artificial neural network. Finally, the calculation model of efficiencies of cycle with the change of different parameters was developed based on artificial neural network. The results demonstrated that the current artificial neural network models were capable of predicting and calculating the best high pressure and efficiencies of cycle accurately.

AB Catalytic fast co-pyrolysis (co-CFP) of bamboo sawdust and waste tire over HZSM-5 and Mg0 was conducted using a tandem pyrolysis and upgrading system which consists of a bubbling fluidized bed and a fixed bed reactor. HZSM-5 mixed and sequential with MgO modes were studied to explore the additive effect for the promotion of aromatic hydrocarbons. Experimental results indicated that co-CFP of bamboo sawdust with waste tire over pure HZSM-5 increased the yields of pyrolysis oil and char, while the gas yield decreased with the increasing of waste tire percentage in the feedstock blends. The product distribution of pyrolysis oil obtained from co-CFP of bamboo sawdust and waste tire over pure HZSM-5 was dominated by aromatic hydrocarbons, and the relative concentration increased from 26.71 to 71.50% as the waste tire percentage elevated from 0 to 60 wt%. Co-CFP of bamboo sawdust and waste tire using HZSM-5 mixed with MgO mode produced a higher yield of pyrolysis oil than the sequential mode when HZSM-5/MgO mass ratio was raised from 1:4 to 1:1. However, the sequential mode was proved to be more effective in the promotion of aromatic hydrocarbons than the mixed mode at a higher HZSM-5 proportion. A positive additive effect for alkylbenzenes was found when the sequential mode was used at varying HZSM-5/Mg0 mass ratios. Regarding the olefins, C10 olefins were main products, and limonene selectivity increased at first and then decreased with the highest selectivity of 38.87% occurring at HZSM-5/Mg0 of 2:3 in the mixed mode case. The additive effect of HZSM-5 and MgO indicated that both the mixed and sequential modes inhibited the formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with the most significant additive effect obtained at HZSM-5/Mg0 mass ratio of 1:1 using the mixed mode.

AB In this study, thermal and hydraulic attributes of an ecofriendly graphene nanofluid flowing within a countercurrent spiral heat exchanger are evaluated. The cold water flows in one side while the hot nanofluid or hot base fluid moves in the other side of heat exchanger. The heat transfer rate and overall heat transfer coefficient enhance with increasing either Reynolds number or concentration. The effect of adding nanoparticles becomes more important at higher Reynolds numbers. At great Reynolds number, the higher heat transfer occurs in the end sections of the heat exchanger whereas at low Reynolds number, the chief heat exchange happens at the initial sections. The results show that the value of effectiveness is much great (higher than 0.85) in all cases under investigation. Moreover, the effectiveness and number of transfer units decrease by increasing the Reynolds number. The pressure drop intensifies with the Reynolds number increment, and the nanofluid demonstrates a greater pressure drop than the base fluid especially at higher Reynolds numbers. Meanwhile, the cold fluid demonstrates a higher pressure drop compared with the hot fluid due to the greater viscosity. The performance index, i.e. the ratio of heat transfer rate to pressure drop, enhances with increase in either Reynolds number or concentration, which is a promising result. Thereby, the performance index for the nanofluid increases almost 142% by increasing the Reynolds number from 1000 to 3000.

AB This paper studies a fresh air handling system, which is composed of a mechanical compression refrigeration system and an evaporative cooling system. In an effort to improve the basic systems, a single-stage total heat recovery module consisting of a cooler and a spray packing is incorporated into the system (process I). The results show that when keeping the total heat and mass transfer capability constant, the coefficient of performance (COP) of process I first increases and then decreases with increasing heat and mass transfer capability of the total heat recovery module. Under typical summer conditions, the optimum COP of process I is 8.5% higher than that of the conventional system. To reduce the exergy destruction in the total heat recovery module and increase the supply air temperature, a single-stage sensible heat recovery module is also incorporated (process II), leading to a further increase in the optimum COP of 3.3% and suitable supply air temperature. A test device based on process II was constructed to experimentally validate the simulation results. The experimental results demonstrate that the system performance is better for high temperature and humidity fresh air conditions owing to the higher proportion of total heat recovery.

AB The operating temperature of hydraulic oils should be controlled within a reasonable range to keep hydraulic systems in good working condition. However, due to the huge energy losses of hydraulic systems, the oil temperature will increase rapidly. In addition, some hydraulic equipment often operate in cold weather conditions. The conventional cooling with radiators and preheating with electric heaters will consume extra energy for hydraulic systems. Therefore, an organic Rankine cycle with heat pump system is proposed to achieve regenerative cooling and energy-efficient preheating. The system can operate in two modes: an organic Rankine cycle mode to produce electricity instead of consuming energy while cooling the hot oil, and a heat pump mode to preheat the oil with less energy before the hydraulic system starts up in a cold environment. The system is applied to a 260-ton hydraulic excavator to investigate the technical feasibility. On average, the calorific power of the excavator is 177 kW at 245 kW of consumed power in a typical cycle. Considering the cost of heat source, the earning of equilibrium temperature is proposed to evaluate the benefit of the organic Rankine cycle. The optimal working fluid is selected by comparing the system performance. Afterward, the peak points of earning of equilibrium temperature at different ambient temperatures are observed. Corresponding to the maximum earning of equilibrium temperature, the output power of the organic Rankine cycle ranges from 7.63 kW to 2.89 kW. These results show significant energy savings by applying the proposed system in the hydraulic system.

AB Spray cooling has proved to be the promising candidate for the scheme of extremely high heat flux dissipation. The largest innovation of this paper is to develop a novel fluidic organization to realize the application of an air oriented spray cooling system, considering the operating specialty of the air vehicle. Since an easy availability of the high-pressure air, an air-activated ejector and a gas-atomized nozzle rather than the normal high-pressurized liquid-driven nozzle are adopted. The ejector functions as a pump to collect and recycle the sprayed coolant under various gravitational fields, which is critical for the durable operation of the system. Design procedures of the ejector are developed, based on which a practical ejector is fabricated to be installed in the ground-based system. Heat transfer experiments were organized since there is there is a lack of study on the gas-atomized spray cooling performance. The state of the input high-pressure air and water which is used to generate the spray flow was optimized according to the cooling performance. Basic thermal laws regarding the gas-atomized spray cooling are attained. The highest the heat flux was 885.4 W/cm(2) with a surface temperature of only 85.1 degrees C which justifies its future application of onboard thermal control system.

AB Hydropower plants operation may change river flow, thereby degrading the stability of river ecosystems. The primary purpose of this paper is to compute the comprehensive ecological water demand and establish ecological operation models to quantitatively analyze the interactions between power generation and degree of ecological flow satisfaction under different operation modes. The comprehensive ecological water demand takes the river base flow, ecological flow process and ecological water demands of fish habitat during the spawning period into account. The driest monthly streamflow under a 90% frequency method, range of variability approach and two-dimensional depth-averaged finite element model were adopted to obtain the ecological flow. In addition, to study the impacts of the ecological operation of hydropower plants on power generation, three optimal operation models including a maximum power generation model (Model-I), a minimum ecological change model (Model-I) and a multi-objective optimization operation model (Model-III), are established. In model-II, the average annual power generation of the cascade hydropower plants decreased by 10.61% compared with Model-I, and meanwhile the degree of ecological change reduced by 75.41%, which means, the reduction of power generation by 35.66 x 10(8) kWh could lead to a reduction of 11.4% on the degree of ecological degradation. Afterwards, the multi-objective problem of economic and ecological benefits in model-III was solved by the application of NSGA-II. Among them, scheme 3 is recommended for Model III, and its power generation and degree of ecological change are 311.69 x 10(8) kWh and 6.64%, respectively. In general, mutual restrictions and conflicts between power generation and ecological demand are inevitable, but they can be optimized through multi-objective ecological operation models to fetch the coordinated development of economy and ecology.

AB Adsorption cooling systems powered by low-grade thermal or renewable energy are considered as a potential alternative to the vapor compression systems. To improve the performance and compactness of the system, this study focuses on the synthesis and characterization of activated carbon (AC) composite employing graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) namely H-grade and C-grade, and polyvinyl alcohol. The influence of GNPs on the porous properties, thermal conductivity, and ethanol adsorption characteristics of composites have been experimentally investigated. Porous properties results show that the studied composites possess high surface area and pore volume with microporous nature. The C-grade contained composite shows the higher porous properties compared to H-grade, however, thermal conductivity for the later one is the highest. The highest thermal conductivity is found to be 1.55 W m(-1) K-1 for H-grade (40 wt%) contained composite which is 23.5 times higher than that of powder AC. Ethanol adsorption characteristics on studied composites are conducted gravimetrically at adsorption temperatures 30-70 degrees C. Experimental data are also fitted with Toth and Dubinin-Astakhov (D-A) isotherm models within +/- 5% RMSD and found 23% improvement of effective volumetric uptake for H25 (20 wt%) composite compared to parent AC. The instantaneous ethanol adsorption uptake onto composites has also been presented for adsorption temperature 30 degrees C and evaporator pressure at 1.8 kPa.

AB A numerical model is developed to predict the performance of a microchannel methanol steam reformer with different catalyst layer configurations to produce hydrogen-rich syngas for a high temperature polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (HT-PEMFC). A solution schema is developed to compare continuous catalyst layer configurations and various segmented catalyst layer configurations without any convergence issue in numerical analysis. In this work, heat is provided to the endothermic reforming-side via methanol combustion. The results show that higher heat transfer rates can be provided by applying segmented catalyst layer configurations thus, resulting in significant performance improvement of the microchannel methanol steam reformer. The results reveal that methanol conversion can be increased by similar to 25% by using segmented catalyst layer configurations with less catalyst in the reforming and combustion sides. The results also indicate that even though there is no significant improvement in methanol conversion with increasing catalyst layer thickness, the greater catalyst layer thickness provides the advantage of reduced high temperature elevations across the reformer length. Overall, the segmented catalyst layer configurations can play an important role in designing a next generation of microchannel reformers for fuel cell power generation systems to maximize power, minimize reformer size, and decrease the required quantity of the catalyst.

AB Temperature and cell aging are two major factors that influence the reliability and safety of Li-ion batteries. A general battery model considering both temperature and degradation is often difficult to develop, given the fact that there are many different types of cells with different shapes and/or internal chemical components. In response, a migration-based framework is proposed in this paper for battery modeling, in which the effects of temperature and aging are treated as uncertainties. An accurate model for a fresh cell is established first and then migrated to the degraded batteries through a Bayes Monte Carlo method. Experiments are carried out on both LiFePO4 batteries and Li(Ni1/3Co1/3Mn1/3) O-2 batteries under various ambient temperatures and aging levels. The results indicate that the typical voltage prediction error can be limited within +/- 20 mV, for the cases of temperature change up to 40 degrees C, and capacity degradation up to 20%. The proposed method paves ways to an effective battery management and energy control for electric vehicles or micro grid applications.

AB The objective of this paper is the investigation of a thermal photovoltaic concentrating collector operating with and without nanofluids. The use of nanofluid Syltherm 800/copper oxide with 5% volumetric concentration is examined and it is compared with the base fluid. The examined thermal photovoltaic has a parabolic concentrator and an inverted flat insulated receiver. The analysis is conducted with SolidWorks Flow Simulation which is able to perform the thermal, optical and flow analysis. According to the present study, the system is able to operate for inlet fluid temperatures up to 200 degrees C which is a promising result. Moreover, it is found that the use of nanofluid leads to enhancement both in thermal and electrical performance for all the examined cases (different combinations of flow rates and inlet temperatures). For an inlet temperature at 100 degrees C and flow rate 540 L/h with nanofluid, the thermal efficiency and the electrical efficiency were found at 46.84% and 6.60% respectively. For this case, the enhancements in the thermal, electrical, total and exergy efficiencies were found at 1.66%, 5.17%, 2.08% and 3.05% respectively.

AB Combined Cooling, Heating and Power system is one of the methods for improvement of primary energy using, reducing emissions and energy consumption costs compared to other usual energy supply systems. Because of the ability to use different fuel sources, lower noise and high efficiency, the Stirling engine has a great potential for Combined Cooling, Heating and Power system as prime mover. Hence, in this paper, a comprehensive analysis of this system with Stirling engine and absorption chiller has been proposed. This system has been evaluated from perspectives of energy, exergy, fuel consumption, carbon dioxide emissions and fuel costs at various rotational speeds of the Stirling engine and has been compared to usual energy supply system for buildings. Also, for the proposed system in different working conditions, the payback period is estimated. The modeling results illustrated that that the Coefficient of Performance (useful cooling capacity to required energy input) of absorption chiller, power output, heat loss, and exergy destruction reach to their maximum values during high rotational speeds. Also, the thermal efficiency, exergy efficiency, fuel consumption reduction, carbon dioxide emission reduction, and fuel costs reduction reach to their higher values at lower rotational speeds and the overall efficiency of the system reach to its maximum value at moderate rotational speeds. Therefore, based on different priorities, this system can be used at different engine rotational speeds. Also, with system operation of 6 h per day at the average engine rotational speeds, the payback period has been estimated less than 3 years.

AB Accurate wind speed forecasting is critical to the exploitation and utilization of wind energy. In this paper, a novel wind speed multi-step prediction model is designed based on the SSA (Singular Spectrum Analysis), EMD (Empirical Mode Decomposition) and CNNSVM (Convolutional Support Vector Machine). In the SSA-EMD-CNNSVM model, the SSA is used to reduce the noise and extract the trend information of the original wind speed data; the EMD is used to extract the fluctuation features of the wind speed data and decompose the wind speed time series into a number of sub-layers; and the CNNSVM is used to predict each of the wind speed sub-layers. To investigate the prediction performance of the proposed model, some models are used as the comparison models, including the SVM model, CNNSVM model, EMD-BP model, EMD-RBF model and EMD-Elman model. According to the prediction results of the four experiments, it can be found that the proposed model can have significantly better performance than the seven comparison models from 1-step to 3-step wind speed predictions with the MAPE of 42.85% average performance promotion, MAE of 39.21% average performance promotion, RMSE of 39.25% average performance promotion.

AB In this paper, a new AMTEC/TAR hybrid system was proposed to utilize condensation heat of the alkali metal thermal to electric converter (AMTEC) as heat source for the triple-effect absorption refrigeration (TAR). Based on the first and second laws of thermodynamics, a theoretical analysis has been undertaken to evaluate the performance of the hybrid system. Meanwhile, the effects of the electrode current density, the condenser temperature in AMTEC, the pressure of medium pressure generator, and the temperatures of absorber, medium pressure generator and low pressure generator on the performance of the hybrid system were investigated and discussed. The results show that the AMTEC condensation heat can be effectively utilized by the TAR. When the evaporation temperature of AMTEC is 1200 K, the maximum value of exergetic efficiency of hybrid system is 42.7%, the input heat flow rate is 166.4 kW, and the output electric power and cooling load are 48.8 kW and 110.2 kW, respectively. The maximum exergy destruction rate is generally from the heat loss of AMTEC, but when the electrode current density is relatively high or the temperature of AMTEC evaporator is relatively low, the maximum exergy destruction rate comes out of the BASE.

AB Huge amount of cold-end energy discharged from the CO2 capture/compression process is not thermodynamically satisfactory for monoethanolamine (MEA)-based de-carbonization coal-fired power plants. In this study, an improved cold-end energy utilization concept for a MEA-based de-carbonization coal-fired power plant was innovatively proposed, which highly integrates the CO2 capture/compression, steam bleeding, and boiler air pre-heating processes to cascade utilize the system cold-end energies, and beneficially supplies the heat required for solvent regeneration and air preheating. To be specific, three paths have been adopted: (1) reboiler condensate recirculation: part of the reboiler condensate is recirculated to mix with the steam bleed to provide the heat for solvent regeneration; (2) absorption heat transformer (AHT): upgrading the reboiler condensate heat for solvent regeneration; and (3) multi-stage air heating: cascade utilization of the heat discharged from coolers within CO2 capture/compression process to preheat combustion air prior to the flue gas-air preheater, saving part of the flue gas heat to be used in a more cascade way. The mass and energy balance of the proposed system and the overall system performance were determined using the process simulation. The energy saving mechanism of the adopted three paths were investigated through adopting the graphical exergy analysis for the reboiler block and air preheating process. The cost of electricity (COE) and cost of CO2 avoided (COA) of the proposed system were also determined. Results showed that the energy efficiency of the proposed system could be 3.2 percentage points higher than that of the conventional de-carbonization plant without cold-end energy utilization. The COE and COA of the proposed system were reduced by 8.0% and 22.2%, respectively.

AB In this study, an investigation of a new three-dimensional model of thermoelectric generators (TEGs) by using CFD modeling is performed. A solution is presented for the physical model of the TEG module which couples the thermal and electrical models. The solution is carried out by using three-dimensional (3D) numerical solution and User defined function (UDF) of the ANSYS-Fluent software. Then, the 3D model is utilized to study the impact of flow regimes on the performance of the TEG mounted on a chimney wall. Also, the impact of the inlet flow velocity of the hot flow gasses and coolant air inside and outside the chimney, respectively on the heat transfer and output power of the TEG is studied. The results show that the present 3D model results agree well with the experimental results compared to the previous models' results. The maximum output power from the TEG modules is obtained when the TEG is installed at the inlet position followed by the turbulent positions of the hot flow gases and cooling air. Increasing the inlet velocity of the hot gases without increasing cooling air velocity or vice versa hasn't great effect on the TEG output power. The heat transfer of the cold side of the TEG is more effective on the TEG output power compared to that of the hot side at the same total flow velocity entering the chimney. To cover only a part of the chimney walls by the TEG modules, and maximize the TEG output power, it is recommended to install the available TEG modules at the chimney wall at the inlet position of the chimney and at the position of the turbulent flow regions inside and outside the chimney.

AB With the rapid political and economic developments, energy saving and carbon dioxide emission reduction are now recognized as the most important goals worldwide. Therefore, this paper presents a production capacity analysis and energy optimization model that uses novel extreme learning machine integrating affinity propagation clustering. By using the affinity propagation method, clusters of raw data can be obtained automatically to reduce multi-dimensional data and fuse the high-similarity data. Then, the clustering results are taken as the training and testing sets of the extreme learning machine to improve prediction accuracy and analyze production capacity. Through comparisons with the extreme learning machine, back propagation, radical basis function and extreme learning machine integrated K-means clustering algorithm, the accuracy and validity of the proposed method are verified by using the University of California Irvine data sets. Finally, the proposed method is applied to build the production capacity analysis and energy optimization model of the ethylene and purified terephthalic acid production systems in complex petrochemical industries. The prediction accuracy of the ethylene and purified terephthalic acid production is approximately 99%, thus improving the energy efficiency of these complex petrochemical processes and achieving energy saving and carbon dioxide emission reduction.

AB In this paper, we report an integrated techno-economic analysis of glycerol steam reforming (GSR) targeting distributed H-2 refueling stations for a H-2 production capacity of 700 m(3) h(-1). A process simulation based on mass and energy balances was performed to identify the product yield at effect of temperature and water/glycerol ratio. The results show that temperature of 900 K and a water/glycerol ratio of 9 are optimal to techno-economically operate a GSR process. An economic analysis using itemized cost estimation, sensitivity analysis (SA), and profitability analysis (PA) was carried out to investigate the economic feasibility of GSR for distributed H-2 refueling stations. The unit H-2 production cost was 4.46 $ kgH(2)(-1) at the optimum conditions identified in the process simulation, and the most influential economic key factor was the reactant from the SA. Meaningful economic indicators such as net present value, discounted payback period, present value ratio, and rate of return on investment were obtained from the PA through a discounted cash flow diagram. Moreover, a cumulative probability analysis based on an uncertainty analysis using a Monte-Carlo simulation method was applied to unit H-2 production cost and B/C ratio calculations to quantify the risk of a proposed GSR process as premature technology providing crucial guidelines to decision-makers.

AB Ensuring continuous power supply in the hybrid renewable energy and battery system is important because power utilization is fundamental to economy and human well-being. Earlier studies have been concerned with the ability to supply a desired amount of power in a long-term static condition in the context of system reliability. Meanwhile, short-term dynamic behavior and its relevant vulnerability in a hybrid system associated with a continuous power supply has been given less attention due to the modeling complexity of the problem. This study uses a parametric approach to assess the dynamic transition of vulnerabilities potentially leading to disruptions in electricity supply throughout a given day to identify a specific vulnerable time. The methodology of quantifying the dynamic vulnerability of power source components during a given day in a hybrid system is developed. Then, the temporal dynamic vulnerability and overall vulnerability in the system are presented by changing the capacity size in the case of a fictitious standalone house. Through the analysis, the approach developed in this study would potentially highlight the greater contribution of the battery to continuous power supply, compared with the solar PV in the hybrid system.

AB In the present article, a cycle is proposed for combined production of cooling, heating and electricity. A polymer exchange membrane fuel cell is used as the prime mover. The waste heat is recovered by a plate heat exchanger, and the hot water is used as the heat source of a two-bed adsorption chiller, and heating as well. In addition, the excess hot and chilled water are used to generate electricity in thermoelectric generator. To feed the thermoelectric generator with a steady temperature hot/cold-thermal damping tanks are proposed and a procedure is developed to design them. The mathematical models of the fuel cell, adsorption chiller, and thermoelectric generator are validated with the results of other researchers. Detail design information is provided for the plate heat exchanger, hot/cold-thermal damping tanks, and fins of the sink/source sides of the thermoelectric generator. Parametric and sensitivity analyses are presented for four design parameters. The sensitivity analysis showed that overall efficiency is most/least sensitive to the current density/number of thermoelectric modules. For normal operating conditions the overall energy/exergy efficiencies are 75% and 53%. In comparison with the conventional systems the fuel energy saving ratio is 39% and 16.9 tons/year less carbon dioxide is produced. In addition, the for hydrogen price of less than 2 United States dollars per kilogram the CCHP can compete with conventional systems.

AB The development of fault diagnosis systems able to early detect and identify any malfunctioning is of great importance towards the diffusion of energy conversion plants based on solid oxide fuel cells. Because the traditional model-based schemes for the diagnosis demonstrated a poor fault identification capability (especially when many operating conditions and fault sizes are combined), hybrid schemes were proposed that, incorporating pattern recognition classifiers, achieved significant performance improvements. However, like in the model-based case, the hybrid schemes require the running of the plant model in parallel to the real plant functioning. In this study, a data-driven fault diagnosis scheme is presented, in which the plant model is used only off-line, for the training of the classifier. Both support vector machine and random forest classifiers are proposed and tested. It is demonstrated that, when a support vector machine classifier is deployed, the data driven system outperforms the hybrid systems in both fault detection and fault identification. High-level performance is achieved despite the large number of combinations among working conditions and fault sizes used for testing the system.

The system underwent steady state testing over its full operating range, and first (energy) and second (exergy) law analyses were conducted on the collected data. At rated speed, first law results reveal the ecopower operated at an electrical efficiency of 24.4 +/- 0.7% and a utilization factor of 94.5 +/- 12.6%. At the same speed, the ecopower's second law electrical efficiency was 24.3 +/- 0.8% and total second law efficiency (including exergy in both the recovered heat an electrical streams) was 33.7 +/- 1.9%. This total second law efficiency was higher than that of common h sidential heating devices, including electric and gas furnaces and boilers, electric air-source heat pumps, and gas engine driven heat pumps. Further, the ecopower outperformed most of these devices at all part-load condition as well, indicating it would be an appropriate choice for a dispatchable generator to provide ancillary grit support services in a future with increased variable renewable generator penetration. System-level and intern. combustion engine irreversibilities are also presented to identify areas of inefficiency. The most prominet irreversibilities were (in decreasing magnitude) irreversible heat transfer, combustion irreversibility, friction and pumping losses, followed by generator and power electronic losses.

AB To mitigate the adverse effects of wind power fluctuation on power system operation, this paper proposes an advanced hybrid approach for improving precision and efficiency of wind power prediction. This approach mainly contains two-phases modeling process. First, a primary model based on wind power curve is constructed, whose function is to obtain the trend of wind power prediction from physical mechanism. Then, errors of the primary model are extracted and regarded as the studied objects of the second phase. Second, making use of the modeling superiority of data mining algorithms, data-driven models are constructed for error correction. The final results of wind power prediction are combined by that of these two phases. Through the study on an actual wind farm, it validates that the proposed approach outperforms traditional models on precision and cost analysis. By using a defined improvement degree, the quantitative results show there are 60-80% of improvement on different metrics than the primary physical model, and 30-70% of improvement than traditional statistical models.

AB Variable renewable electricity sources have been shown to reduce wholesale electricity market prices. This is expected to reduce the incentive for investments in new electricity production capacity, and might even make these investments infeasible, if relying only on the income from trade on the current electricity market paradigms. In this paper, a novel approach for quantifying this effect in future energy systems is developed using a holistic energy system approach. The approach is applied to the case of Denmark in 2015, which is part of the Nordic and Baltic wholesale electricity market Nord Pool Spot. A holistic energy system model is created and verified according to both the Danish energy balance and the Nord Pool Spot system price in 2015. Using this verified model, the Nord Pool Spot system price is quantified at increasing amounts of onshore wind power, offshore wind power and photovoltaic in Denmark. It is found that regardless of which variable renewable electricity source is implemented, including a combination of the three, the Nord Pool Spot system price decreases as the amount of energy produced by these sources increases, and this effect occurs immediately as more is introduced.

AB The integrated sorption-enhanced chemical looping reforming and water splitting (SECLR-WS) process was proposed for hydrogen (H-2) production from biogas using iron oxide as an oxygen carrier and calcium oxide (CaO) as a carbon dioxide (CO2) adsorbent. In the SECLR-WS process, the biogas feed is partially oxidized using iron oxide and CO2 is captured by CaO in the fuel reactor (FR) to produce H-2-rich syngas. The iron oxide is re oxidized in the steam reactor (SR) to generate a high-purity H-2 stream and CaO is regenerated in the calcinator. The simulation of the SECLR-WS process was based on a thermodynamic approach and was performed using an Aspen Plus simulator. The effects of key parameters such as the steam feed to the FR to methane (S-FR/CH4) and iron (II, III) oxide (Fe3O4) to CH4 (Fe3O4/CH4) molar ratios on the process performance in terms of H-2 yield and purity, and CH4 conversion were investigated. The results showed that the H-2 yield, H-2 purity in the FR, and CH4 conversion could be improved by increasing the S-FR/CH4 and CaO/CH4 molar ratios. A total H-2 yield of 3.8 and a H-2 purity in the FR of 97.01 mol% can be obtained at the FR and SR temperatures of 610 and 500 degrees C, and S-FR/CH4, CaO/CH4, Fe3O4/CH4, and S-SR/CH4 molar ratios of 2.2, 1.66, 1, and 2.87, respectively. The molar concentration of carbon monoxide (CO) in the high-purity H-2 stream could be reduced by increasing the pressure in the SR and the amount of CO2 in the biogas feed stream negatively affected the performance of the system. In addition, increasing the Fe3O4/CH4 molar ratio can improve the heat demand in the FR.

AB As the wind energy developing, wind speed prediction is important for the reliability of wind power system and the integration of wind energy into the power network. This paper proposed a novel model based on hybrid mode decomposition (HMD) method and online sequential outlier robust extreme learning machine (OSORELM) for short-term wind speed prediction. In data pre-processing period, wind speed is deeply decomposed by HMD, which is comprised of variational mode decomposition (VMD), sample entropy (SE) and wavelet packet decomposition (WPD). The crisscross algorithm (CSO) is applied to optimize the input-weights and hidden layer biases for OSORELM, which have impact on the forecasting performance. The experiment results show that: (a) HMD is an effective way of wind speed decomposition, which can capture the characteristics of wind speed time series accurately and thus promote the prediction performance; (b) the OSORELM performs better than offline models in practical forecasting; (c) the proposed forecasting model has greatly improved the accuracy in mult-istep wind speed forecasting.

AB This study used the Taguchi method combined with Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to present optimization design of the Photovoltaic-Thermal (PV/T) system for improving the two quality characteristics namely electrical and thermal efficiency. The control parameters for PV/T design including the collector plate material, collector azimuth, number of collector tubes, mass flow rate, collector angle, and storage tank volume to area (V/A) ratio are crucial factors affecting the performance of the PV/T. First, Taguchi method coupled with main effect analysis (MEA) and analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to obtain the best parameters combination on each single quality characteristic of electricity and thermal efficiency. In order to achieve the maximum total efficiency of the PV/T system, multi-quality analysis AHP was used to obtain the optimal control parameters combination according to the contribution degrees of quality weight. Then, the computational fluid dynamic (CFD) software used to simulate the PV/T module thermal distribution before and after optimization. The optimization control parameters combination are: collector plate material is copper, collector azimuth is due south, number of collector tubes is 12, mass flow rate is 0.01 kg/s-m(2), collector angle is 25 degrees, and V/A ratio is 123. The effectiveness of the proposed method was evaluated by the confirmation experiments. The optimization properties under these parameters are electrical efficiency 14.29% and thermal efficiency 44.96% which is improved than traditional PV/T system (electrical efficiency 12.74% and thermal efficiency 34.06%). The findings of CFD showed that the temperature of the PV/T module decreased by about 10 degrees C after optimality analysis, and the coefficient of correlation between the simulated and actual PV/T water temperatures was 0.991 (very close to 1). The CFD simulated performance testing proposed in this study has a good verification effect.

AB Present synergistic review is an attempt to evaluate compatibility of application of solar energy based systems for water purification. It provides an eagles perspective on progressive and contemporary, experimental and theoretical studies of water purification and production. Review focuses on conventional as well as modern techniques of desalination and waste water treatment. Systems modification with application of advanced materials and mimicking natures ways of conversion of waste water into potable water in vapor form has been new areas of research. Twenty-first century being marked with consistent and focused effort to conserve natural resources. It can be addressed by putting enhanced emphasis on use of non-conventional energy resources. Hybrid materials, like core shells, blended nanofluids can be used for selective absorptance of ultraviolet and infra-red radiation. This may be utilized in disinfection of certain type of harmful bacteria, and to enhance rate of diffusion through thin membrane. These are an innovative and promising techniques being used in recent years. There has been policy initiative taken by governments and research institutions to use solar energy in devices which are designed for water purification and production. With use of advanced materials for filter design, design modification of solar energy collecting devices, employing suitable photocatalytic conversion processes, area specific need based purification systems can be developed.

AB This work aims to analyze the complementary operation between an existing hydropower plant and a projected wind farm in a remote area of Argentinean Patagonia. With this new generation, the grid element sizes will be insufficient to handle both generation sources at rated. Particulary, a bottleneck will be present at the transmission line and the coupling transformer with the main grid. To avoid this situation, a coordinated dispatch policy of both generation sources is proposed. With this aim, a heuristic algorithm is developed that improves energy generation under the transmission system restrictions. The proposal is assessed and compared with other operation policies on the basis of real data collected over nine years. The benefits of the proposal, that basically consists in reducing wind and hydro power spillage are highlighted. Furthermore, the impact of enlarging the wind farm on the overall power system production is also evaluated.

AB Strontium oxide (SrO) is restricted by poor reusability and pore structure in catalyzing transesterification for biodiesel production. To address this problem, metal organic frameworks is employed as a carrier to support strontium carbonate by mechanical mixing method (MM) and in situ titration method (ST), and then calcined under inert atmosphere to obtain the catalyst of MM-SrO and ST-SrO. As a comparison, the reusability of pure SrO is compared and the homogeneous contribution of leached active sites for ST-SrO and MM-SrO are also assessed. The catalysts are characterized by TG, XRD, FTIR, EDS, Hammett indicator titration, nitrogen adsorption-desorption, and VSM. From the catalyst reusability, MM-SrO exhibits the excellent performance, where the maximum conversion of 96.19% is achieved at molar ratio of methanol to oil 12, catalyst addition 8 wt% (refer to oil), reaction temperature 65 degrees C within 30 min. And the conversion of 82.49% is still obtained at the third cycle, which could be easily separated from the mixture by external magnetic field after each cycle as well. In order to optimize the activation condition and investigate MM-SrO deeply, thermal characteristics of its corresponding precursor are further evaluated, where the TG experiments are conducted at heating rate of 20, 30, and 40 degrees C/min. and kinetic parameters are calculated through model-free method and Avrami theory, respectively.

AB The requirements for cleaner engines and less fuel consumption force vehicle manufacturers to investigate new technologies on recovering from losses. As the main contributor to losses is the waste heat, studies are carried out to convert the waste heat to mechanical work. In this paper, an evaluation of Stirling engines is presented for waste heat recovery (WHR) from exhaust gases of a heavy-duty truck diesel engine. Maximum theoretical dimensionless shaft work for three types of Stirling engines are calculated and compared by optimizing selected parameters with a new dimensionless method. Results are used to size a WHR system that utilizes the thermal power of a commercial truck exhaust gas. Calculations done with exhaust gas temperatures measured during road tests show that, the WHR system with Beta-type Stirling engine is more effective than Alpha and Gamma types due to its higher power density. The WHR system presented provides more than 1.3% of ICE power output and about 1% reduction in fuel consumption, which offers Stirling engine as a reasonable option for WHR on heavy-duty truck engine.

AB In this study, multi-objective optimization of the series and parallel flow type double effect absorption refrigeration systems is presented. Genetic algorithm is used to find the optimal solutions and the Pareto-optimal fronts. First, a thermodynamic model is developed to simulate the double effect series and parallel flow configurations with water-lithium chloride and water-lithium bromide solution pairs. Energy and exergy balances are applied to evaluate coefficient of performance, exergy efficiency and irreversible losses in the system components separately for the two working fluid pairs. Next, optimization is done considering coefficient of performance, exergy efficiency and the total system irreversibility rate as objective functions. The low and high pressure generator temperatures are taken as decision variables in the series configuration while for the parallel system; additionally the distribution ratio is also taken as a decision parameter. The optimization is done for four different cases of fixed evaporator, absorber and condenser temperatures. For each case, the optimal decision parameter values are determined for both the water-lithium chloride and water-lithium bromide operated double effect series and parallel configurations. The optimized coefficients of performance were found slightly lower for water-lithium chloride. Contrary to this, the optimal exergy efficiencies were more and the total system irreversibility were less for water-lithium chloride. Further, the optimal performances of the double effect water-lithium chloride systems were obtained comparatively at lower generator temperatures than those of the water-lithium bromide systems.

AB The complexity in the design of sustainable microgrids based on renewable energy sources have increased recently due to the involvement of multiple performance indices, scenarios, and stakeholders. At disintegrated level such as rural villages in developing nations, the issue has become more severe concerning the involvement of social and cultural characteristics making the problem multidimensional with multiple objectives. Thus, a proper method which can simultaneously consider the various criteria and differing views of the multiple actors involved in varying scenarios is required. In this paper, a bi-level framework based on the integration of decision making and optimization tool for the design of a rural microgrid with a perspective of sustainable development considering the annual load growth is presented. The first design level utilizes the decision analysis models to determine the best possible energy alternatives for the microgrid design considering the number of key performance indices formulating different scenarios and acts as input to the second level of the framework. A multi-objective computational optimization tool is utilized in the second level to carry out the feasibility analysis of best energy alternative in order to obtain an optimal size with a lower cost accounting yearly load growth. The proposed framework is then implemented to design a sustainable microgrid for an unelectrified village in the hilly region. Most importantly the microgrid design based on the proposed methodology for the target site utilizes the available local resources such as solar, hydro with the dam, hydrokinetics based on river water streams, etc. as the primary energy generating sources with a diesel generator as back up along with battery and pump-hydro storage as storage systems. A total of 23 alternatives depending upon the different combination of energy sources and storage is constituted in a centralized off-grid system. Moreover, four primary performance criteria (social, technical, economic and environment) with 20 sub-criteria in 29 different scenarios are considered for evaluating the microgrid which is highly unlikely to be observed in literature so far. A discursive result illustrating the various profiles (generation and storage system) of the microgrid based on daily, monthly and yearly basis accounting the load growth is also presented.

AB Energy supply in an economic and environmentally friendly configuration is a major challenge for urban energy systems. This paper presents two multi-objective models for the design of Distributed Energy Systems (DES) for satisfying local needs in heating, cooling and electricity. DES can be used to promote energy efficiency and reduce carbon emissions which is crucial to tackle climate change. A multi-objective MILP framework is presented, comparing two main methodologies of designing DES using Total Annual Cost (TAC) and carbon emissions as objective functions. The first one, namely "Method A", which performs a simultaneous sizing and the second one, namely "Method B", in which technologies and their respective capacity are predefined. Furthermore, three scenarios regarding the available technologies are developed to assess DES for both methods and a case study is carried out. Results show that in both methods Scenario 3 (a DES coupled with district heating network, microgrid and storage technologies) has the best performance. In terms of comparison between the two methods, "Method A" provides better solutions in terms of cost and emissions as it has more degrees of freedom. Structure, design and operational results are presented and discussed analytically, as well as the possibility of comparing the two methods for a more detailed design.

AB With impending economical concerns and fuel crisis, biodiesel produced from microalgae has been proposed as a potential substitute for petroleum fuel. But experimental characterisation of combustion, performance and emission behaviour of biofuel operating under different operating conditions would be resource consuming. Even numerical modelling using computational fluid mechanics methods would be computationally consuming when combinatorics of all operating conditions are considered. In this study, we append empirical modelling to numerical modelling to derive industry feasible solutions. An artificial neural network was trained with responses at limited operating conditions obtained from a software Diesel-RK. Various variables representing combustion, performance and emission behaviour of IC engine were predicted accurately with average r-value of 0.9801 +/- 0.0146 for operating conditions defined by blending, loading and fuel injection pressure. Redundancy amongst the system variables was also observed thus indicating to possible reduced empirical models.

AB Recycling of CO2 into light olefins offers opportunity to mitigate CO2 emissions, while decreasing dependence on fossil fuels for light olefins production. Herein, we report on the direct conversion of CO2 to light olefins over a hybrid catalyst containing In2O3 admixed with SAPO-34. The effect of mass ratios of In2O3 to SAPO-34 and operating conditions including reaction temperature, reaction pressure and space velocity for maximizing light olefins yield was thoroughly studied. The results show that the interplay of active sites for CO2 hydrogenation (In2O3) and methanol transformation (SAPO-34), and operating conditions are a key factor determining the catalytic behavior. The best yield of light olefins (7.31%) with a CO2 conversion of 34.6% is achieved over the In2O3/SAPO-34 catalyst with a mass ratio of 2:1 at 360 degrees C, 25 bar and 1,500 mL g(cat)(-1) h(-1).

AB In this paper, the performance of a natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) power plant operating in combined heat and power (CHP) mode is analyzed, and the optimization of partial recirculation system is conducted. In order to compare the plant performances between complete and partial recirculation systems, the simulations of NGCC-CHP plants with both systems are performed. Base on the off-design characteristics of both systems, the optimal operating strategies are proposed to achieve energy utilization efficiency. The comparisons on thermodynamic performance and operational flexibility between the plants with both systems are performed. Results show that in contrast with the complete recirculation system, the partial recirculation system can improve the energy utilization efficiency of the NGCC-CHP plant by 0.48-0.58% at various conditions. More waste heat can be recovered from flue gas under the limitation of dew point corrosion. Moreover, the heat generation capacity of the plant increases and the operational gap between extraction-condensing mode and backpressure mode of the plant shrinks. The plant achieves the decoupling between power generation and heat generation at backpressure mode. The combined heat and power operational continuity and flexibility of the plant with partial recirculation system is superior to that with complete recirculation system.

AB A three-dimensional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation for the GPU-3 Stirling engine is performed. Firstly, the performance of six different eddy-viscosity models are assessed to identify the most appropriate model for the engine simulation. Secondly, a comprehensive characterization of the thermal and fluid flow fields during the cycle is presented. The effects of the unsteady behaviors of both thermodynamics and fluid dynamics on the heat transfer phenomena are also investigated. Results show that the realizable k-epsilon-enhanced wall treatment model produced the most accurate predictions for engine power with a robust convergence and a reasonable computational time. The average deviation in the CFD results with this model compared with the experimental ones is about 4%. Within the compression and expansion spaces, the dominant heat transfer rates occur during the expansion strokes due to the significant impinging effect of the tumble vortices generated from the flow jetting. Furthermore, the jetting and ejecting processes into the regenerator is characterized by a significant temperature gradient and large matrix temperature oscillation. Also, the temperature profile through the regenerator is almost logarithmic.

In this study, we sought to enhance the heat transfer efficiency of LED by incorporating fins with a grooved heat pipe on the heat sink. ANSYS Fluent software is used to model the heat transfer mechanisms in order to optimize the heat pipe parameters and fin design with the aim of maintaining the LED chip temperature within a safe operating range. The temperature distributions of LED headlights are simulated for different materials of the heat sink and the printed circuit board (PCB), and fin designs with a heat pipe. In the study, it was found that an increase in the thermal conductivity coefficient of the substrate resulted in a decrease in the LED junction temperature; however, higher thermal efficiency was not necessarily sufficient. The proposed model showed that the integration of 76-mm-long grooved heat pipes with an effective thermal conductivity of 6000 W/(m.K) and 2-mm prolonged plate heat dissipation fins on the heat sink with an AlN Ceramic having a 180 W/(m.K) proved effective in dissipating heat from high-powered LED headlights within a highly constrained space.

AB This paper presents an extensive overview of unconventional waste heat recovery bottoming cycles including air bottoming cycle, Carbon dioxide-based power cycles and Kalina bottoming cycle. Noting that this is a two-part review paper, first part mainly focuses on the technical aspects of these waste heat recovery methods by reviewing studies on energy, exergy, economic analyses of these systems, as well as reviewing part load analysis, component design, power augmentation and comparative analysis between conventional and unconventional systems. This part demonstrates and thoroughly review the applications of the aforementioned unconventional bottoming cycles, including renewable energy sources. Eleven applications were discussed including renewable energy sources integration, internal combustion engine, CCHP systems, carbon capture operation, offshore platforms, gas transport, fuel cells, and marine industry. It was concluded that air bottoming cycle is not thermodynamically competitive with other bottoming cycles due to its high operating temperature. Whilst CO2 and Kalina cycles were competitive with conventional waste heat recovery methods such as steam and organic Rankine cycles for medium-to-low grade waste heat sources.

AB Thermoelectric generator which converts waste heat to electricity is a promising approach in energy field. In this paper, a comprehensive numerical model of a thermoelectric couple is built by COMSOL with all related thermoelectric effects and some irreversible effects considered. It is adopted instead of a whole thermoelectric module modeling for a less calculation demanding and time consumption purpose, whose feasibility and equivalence are verified as well. An easy-manipulative symmetric test rig is designed to precisely acquire the electrical and thermal variables of thermoelectric module in terms of heat flow rate, voltage and current in a wide temperature range. The good agreement of test and simulation results validate the effectiveness of the numerical model and the feasibility of test device including its control and measurement systems. Then a novel characterization method called quasi-steady-state method is first proposed to fast and precisely derive the module-level temperature-dependent thermoelectric parameters including Seebeck coefficient S, thermal conductivity lambda and electrical resistivity rho. The characterization procedure is to raise the temperature of the thermoelectric modules hot side at an appropriate heating rate and keep the chiller at a constant temperature both in open and short circuit tests in sequence. The thermoelectric leg is regarded as multiple serial segments divided according to its temperature distribution. One set of equations involving the thermo- and electro- variables is established for each segment in case of a certain temperature difference. All these equations are solved by means of an iterative algorithm and computed by MATLAB. S and lambda are obtained by open circuit tests and rho by the short circuit tests subsequently. The comparison of estimated thermoelectric parameters by tests, simulations and the manufacturers data validate the correctness of the quasi-steady-state method and its predictability ability of the performance of thermoelectric generators in practice.

AB A design optimization strategy for rotary desiccant cooling (RDC) systems integrated with a photovoltaic thermal collector-solar air heater (PVT-SAH) and a phase change material based thermal energy storage (TES) (named RDC-PVT-SAH-TES) is presented in this paper. The optimization method was developed using a multilayer perceptron neural network (MPNN) and a genetic algorithm to maximize the specific net electricity generation (SNEG) of RDC-PVT-SAH-TES systems while maintaining the required cooling demand with the assistance of an electric heater. A dimension reduction method was used to determine the main design parameters of the RDC-PVT-SAH-TES system. An RDC-PVT-SAH-TES system was simulated using TRNSYS and the simulation data were utilized for training and validation of the MPNN model and for dimension reduction analysis. A comparison of the design solution identified by this optimization method with a baseline design showed that the SNEG and the solar thermal contribution of this RDC-PVT-SAH-TES system can be increased from 3.77 kWh/m(2) to 10.32 kWh/m(2) and from 91.5% to 99.4%, respectively. The optimization method developed could be potentially adapted to facilitate optimal design and size of other engineering systems with onsite energy generation and thermal storage.

AB Due to increasing energy demand and fossil fuel costs in island and remote areas, renewable energy resources are becoming increasingly attractive. The hybridization of these resources can help overcome their variability and intermittency and improve efficiency. Many independent hybrid renewable energy systems are used in remote and island areas for which weather data often is unavailable. To increase the accuracy of size optimization of such systems, more accurate weather data is needed and the use of weather forecasting data is helpful. In this article, a new hybrid optimization algorithm is proposed for the optimal sizing of a stand-alone hybrid solar and wind energy system based on three algorithms: chaotic search, harmony search and simulated annealing. To improve the accuracy of the size optimization algorithm results, weather forecasting is used along with artificial neural networks for solar radiation, ambient temperature, and wind speed forecasting. The main objective function of minimizing the total life cycle cost is used to assess the feasibility of the hybrid renewable energy system accounting for system reliability. The reliability of the system is assessed by the loss of power supply probability parameter. The new method is tested for the electrical load of the city of Khorasan, Iran. The results are compared with those obtained by the proposed algorithm (harmony search and simulated annealing-based artificial neural networks). The simulation results demonstrate the advantages of utilizing the hybrid optimization algorithm with weather forecasting data for a stand-alone hybrid renewable energy system.

AB The comprehensive utilization of renewable energy and clean fossil fuel contributes to improving the stability of energy supply system and reducing environmental impact. Therefore, a bio-gas and natural gas co-firing in combined cooling, heating and power (CCHP) system based on ground source heat pump is presented and modeled using exergetic and exergoeconomic methods. The exergy and exergy cost flows of CCHP system are presented under three different gas mass ratios and the influences of some key parameters (biomass and natural gas cost, interest rate, service life and operating time coefficient) on unit exergy cost of products are also analyzed. The results indicate that the introduction of natural gas improves the exergy efficiency; when the gas mass ratio varies from 0 to 1.0 the unit exergy cost of electricity generated by gas turbine, chilled water and hot water decrease from 11.26 $/GJ, 92.21 $/GJ and 69.92 $/GJ to 3.84 $/GJ, 43.52 $/GJ and 23.73 $/GJ, respectively. Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis shows that unit exergy cost of products increases with the increasing of biomass cost, natural gas cost and interest rate; while decreases non-linearly with the increasing of service life and operating time coefficient. The proposed CCHP system provides an idea for other hybrid renewable energy system, and exergoeconomic methodology shows a better understanding of complex energy system performance in terms of both exergy and economic aspects.

AB In this paper, a numerical investigation of a humidification-dehumidification (HDH) desalination system driven by heat pump is presented. The presented system consists of heat pump unit, plate heat exchanger, humidifier, first stage dehumidifier and second stage dehumidifier. A mathematical model based on the heat and mass balance equations of each component was built and verified by the experimental results. The effects of several important parameters of air and seawater into the system on system performance were numerically studied. The parametric analysis indicates that the air temperature has insignificant influence on the system yield, the increment of air humidity ratio or seawater flow rate is obviously beneficial for the productivity improvement and the productivity has different trends with increasing seawater temperature. It is also revealed that the productivity firstly increases and then decreases with the increment of air flow rate. Furthermore, gained output ratio (GOR) of the proposed system and the cost of fresh water are estimated. The average values of GOR and cost are 2.532 and 0.0412 USA dollar (USD) per kilogram respectively, which are competitive in comparison with other reported HDH systems. Additionally, a numerical correlation for the system productivity was regressed with an acceptable deviation.

AB In order to utilize the low-grade thermal energy efficiently, a more realistic model of thermally regenerative electrochemical cycles system with continuous power output is proposed in which the heat transfer irreversibility, external heat leakage and non-ideal regeneration losses are taken into account. Besides, the symmetry of cells, which is necessary for a practical thermally regenerative electrochemical cycles system operated at steady state, is considered. Analytic expressions for the efficiency and power output of the system are derived. The design and operation criteria of the system for achieving continuous power output are obtained. The general performance characteristics and the optimally operating regions of several parameters are reported. The influences of the external heat leakage on the system performance and the upper and lower bounds of efficiency at maximum power output at different situations are evaluated and discussed.

AB Organic Rankine cycle (ORC) has been demonstrated to be an effective and promising technology to recover low-grade heat source. Constant turbine efficiency is generally assumed in most of ORC studies, which is not necessarily accurate. To address this issue, a one-dimensional analysis model of radial-inflow turbine is presented. A comparative analysis of the thermodynamic and economic performances of ORC system with constant turbine efficiency and dynamic turbine efficiency is conducted for eight working fluids. The multi-objective grey wolf optimizer (MOGWO) is employed to conduct the multi-objective optimization of the ORC system with constant turbine efficiency and dynamic turbine efficiency. The optimization results are analyzed and compared to investigate the effects of the turbine efficiency on the working fluid selection and system parameters determination. A comparative analysis of the off-design performance of the ORC system with both types of turbine efficiency is also carried out, and the influence of the heat source inlet temperature on the multi-objective optimization results of the ORC system is also studied. The results show that the turbine efficiency increases with the decrement of evaporation temperature or the increment of condensation temperature, and there are significant differences of turbine efficiency among different working fluids. The optimal working fluid and operating parameters are different between the ORC system with constant and dynamic turbine efficiency. Isopentane and pentane are considered to be the optimal working fluids for the constant turbine efficiency ORC system, while only pentane is considered to be the optimal working fluid for the dynamic turbine efficiency ORC system. As the heat source inlet temperature increases, the difference in the optimal evaporation temperature and the net power output between the two ORC systems increases and the error caused by adopting constant turbine efficiency increase accordingly.

AB The lipid production and nutrients removal of Scenedesmus sp. in non-sterile domestic wastewater were investigated in the present study. Compared with secondary effluent, primary effluent was more appropriate substrate for algal growth, and the biomass concentration and lipid yield reached 0.69 +/- 0.02 g L-1 and 166.7 +/- 8.3 mg L-1, respectively. Ultrasonic exposure significantly enhanced the lipid yield and wastewater treatment performance. The biomass and lipid accumulation increased to 1.56 +/- 0.07 g L-1 and 240 +/- 9.2 mg L-1 at the optimum ultrasonic treatment frequency of 18 Hz, power of 20 W and time of 10 min. The maximum TN and TP removal rates reached 96.8% and 97.7%, respectively. Microbial community analysis revealed that the ultrasonic treatment markedly affected the microbial communities, which can accelerate the formation of favorable microbial community structure. Gemmobacter and Porphyrobacter were identified as key bacteria under ultrasonic condition, and their relative abundances were 38.7% and 19.1%, respectively. This research showed the efficiency of ultrasonic treatment in promoting algal lipid yield and domestic wastewater treatment.

AB The current study is directed at the optimization and energy, exergy, and economic analyse of a solid oxide fuel cell, integrated with gas and steam trigeneration systems. The variables considered are the fuel cell's temperature and pressure, air-to-fuel molar ratio, the compressor and gas turbine pressure ratio, combustion chamber temperature, steam cycle pinch point. The objective functions are the exergy efficiency and the electricity cost. The results show that by selection of the optimal values of the fuel cell's temperature and pressure, air-to-fuel molar ratio, compressor and gas turbine pressure ratio, and the cycle pinch point as 809.8 K, 360 kPa, 2, 2.05, 11.6, and 34.9, the exergy efficiency is increased by 8%, and the produced electricity cost is reduced by 9.7%. The sensitivity analysis shows that an increase in compressor pressure ratio leads to a decrease in the energy and exergy efficiencies and entropy production rates. A change in air-to-fuel molar ratio from 2 to 3 causes the triple cycle electricity cost first to increase and then to decrease.

AB This paper studies a hybrid system for cold production consisting of a compression cycle combined with a thermochemical process by sharing the same condenser, evaporator and refrigerant fluid. The aim of this hybridization is to solve mismatch issues between the demand of cold and the source of energy (availability and/or price) with a system as compact as possible. One important side benefit is that the interaction between the compressor and the thermochemical reactor reduces the activation temperature for ammonia desorption in the thermochemical reactor. To study this interaction a quasi-steady simulation model for both storage and de-storage phases has been developed and experimentally validated by means of a small scale (approx. 300 Wh of cold storage) experimental bench with ammonia as refrigerant and barium chloride (BaCl2) as reactant salt. Experiments proved a 35 K reduction in the activation temperature of the desorption reaction with respect to desorption without compressor. Model validation by adjusting permeability and thermal conductivity of the reactive composite showed an acceptable agreement between predicted and experimental reaction advancement-time curves. The validated model was used for simulation of the system in a preliminary case study, representative in power (40 kW) and temperature (-25 degrees C) of an industrial cold demand. It is shown that during ammonia de-storage, the hybrid achieves a higher COP than a conventional mechanical vapor compression system. It increases exponentially with the relative share of thermochemical storage in the cold production.

AB The specific heat and the heat generation rate are the key thermal properties for lithium ion battery cells. Nonetheless, there exists large scattering in data of thermal properties due to factors such as battery temperature nonuniformity during experimental measurement. In this work, a novel calorimetric method for measuring thermal properties of a lithium ion battery cell is proposed by introducing a temperature even out process to minimize the effect of the temperature difference across the battery. Through this method, the specific heat and the heat generation rate can be characterized for the electrochemical batteries. Thermal parameters of a prismatic lithium iron phosphate battery cell are determined for the wide temperature range at varying operating currents. It is found that the specific heat of the lithium ion battery cell has a linear relationship with the operating temperature, whereas the heat generation rate has a quadratic relationship with the operating current. The measured heat generation rate shows a good agreement with calculated results as per Bernardi's heat generation model. This new method allows one to obtain thermal properties of lithium ion battery cells at a lower cost and in a shorter time.

AB It is a priority to generate affordable and reliable energy with higher participation of renewable energy technologies into the global energy mix to provide efficient sustainable energy services for everyone, highlighting the need to focus on vulnerable communities in developing countries with limited or no access to electricity. Vertical axis wind turbines (VAWT) are widely used for renewable electricity generation. In that order, Savonius rotor, being a VAWT, is commonly used because of its numerous advantages for small scale generation. Thus, wind energy research on a modified Savonius rotor might be a feasible solution for powering vulnerable communities with no access to the grid. Hence, this paper shows how to improve the performance of a conventional Savonius blade by introducing a novel configuration without expensive and complex modifications on the geometry. For that purpose, a C-m and C-p coefficients comparison between 13 proposed scenarios against the conventional configuration to define a novel one, with better performance is carried out through a 2D computational fluid dynamic analysis by using Ansys Fluent 18.0. The SST k-omega to model is selected as the turbulent model. As a result, a higher performance Savonius novel rotor configuration is identified with 17.81% improvement over the conventional configuration.

AB Thermal issues limit the application and development of electronic technique. In this work, temperature-sensitive poly (N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPA) hydrogel is used to dissipate heat for high-heat-flux thermal management (1555.5 W/m(2)) of uneven hotspots in virtual reality (VR) device by mimicking the phenomenon of biological sweating. This bioinspired method has an excellent heat dissipation effect, which significantly reduces the temperatures of the VR chips and the external surface. In addition, the heat transfer coefficient produced by hydrogel perspiration is more than twice that of the natural convection and radiation, resulting in a significant increase in cooling effect, and it can operate efficiently even in an environment with a relative humidity of 1. The heat dissipation control mechanism of this cooling method under different heat flux and the key factors under different mechanisms are analyzed. Besides, the hydrogel exhibited excellent stability. After 450 h of high-temperature and high-humidity (90 degrees C, 85%RH) aging tests and 60 cycles of fatigue tests, hydrogels still maintained a high water content and good swelling properties. The research results suggest that bio-inspired sweat cooling method is an effective and stable thermal management technology for VR devices, which indicates a new approach to address the obstacles of thermal management for development and application of electronic devices and even other heating objects.

AB The purpose of the work is to analyse the performance of an innovative fully renewable micro-hybrid energy system for combined heat and power generation. The apparatus is based on a transcritical Organic Rankine Cycle unit, fuelled by a conventional biomass boiler and a concentrated solar power system consisting of parabolic trough collectors. A thermodynamic model has been developed and the proper plant configurations have been defined through a parametric analysis. The possible application to the residential sector has been investigated considering typical domestic users in Southern Italy. The performance of the innovative micro combined heat and power system has been compared with the corresponding single-source systems (solar-only and biomass-only units). The investigation demonstrates that biomass/solar hybridisation allows reducing the biomass consumption, increasing the maximum operating hours, and improving the global system efficiency. Furthermore, the biomass integration raises the annual net solar-to-electric efficiency. In fact, hybridisation enables a better exploitation of the lowest solar radiations that are not sufficient to drive a full-solar Organic Rankine Cycle and to overcome the intermittency of the solar source.

AB In this work, a novel biporous spiral woven mesh wick is developed to enhance the thermal performance of an ultra-thin flattened heat pipe for cooling high heat flux electronic devices. The biporous wick with different sized pores is hybrid woven using 0.05 and 0.04 mm diameter copper wires in every strand. Three different structures are designed to study the effect of the characteristic parameters of the wick on the thermal performance of the ultra-thin flattened heat pipe. The working fluid flow characteristics of the wick are analyzed theoretically. The capillary rate-of-rise experiment with deionized water using the infrared camera method is carried out to characterize the capillary performance of the wick. The thermal performance of the ultra-thin flattened heat pipe is experimentally investigated. The results indicate that the biporous wick combines the advantages of high permeability due to the large pores and large capillary force due to the small pores. The optimal biporous wick has 22% fewer copper wires than the monoporous wick, but the maximum heat transport capacity of the ultra-thin flattened heat pipe is able to approach 24 W, which realizes the demands of both low production cost and high thermal performance using the biporous wick.

AB Thermal energy storage with an assisted-heat pipe has several useful applications in engineering fields. Due to the large latent heat and nearly constant melting temperature, phase change materials become attractive for thermal energy storage applications. Unfortunately, the low thermal conductivities of phase change materials become a significant issue which should be overcome to achieve high energy storage efficiency. In the current work, a novel sinusoidal heat pipe is designed instead of a circular heat pipe in order to accelerate the melting rate of nanoparticle-enhanced phase change material without affecting the thermal energy storage capacity of system. By developing an enthalpy-based immersed boundary-lattice Boltzmann method for the solid-liquid phase change phenomenon, the melting process of nanoparticle-enhanced phase change material with a sinusoidal heat pipe is investigated with respect to different heat pipe temperature, heat pipe undulation number and sinusoidal amplitude, nanoparticle volume fraction, and eccentric location of heat pipe. The results indicate that the energy storage rate of nanoparticle-enhanced phase change material is highly improved by applying a sinusoidal heat pipe because of its enlarged heat transfer area between heat transfer fluid and nanoparticle-enhanced phase change material. Furthermore, through an optimization study, it is found that applying a sinusoidal heat pipe with larger radius is more effective than adding high thermal conductivity nanoparticles into phase change material to enhance the thermal energy storage rate. Besides, the sinusoidal heat pipe with an eccentric location near the bottom of thermal energy storage cavity is highly recommended to realize a faster phase change material melting rate due to the enhanced effect of natural convective heat transfer.

AB Thermodynamic analysis incorporated with experiments for H-2 production from phenol steam reforming (PSR) over structured Ni/ZnTiO3 nanocatalyst has been investigated. Catalyst samples, prepared via hydrothermal and impregnation methods, were characterized by XRD, FE-SEM, EDX and TGA spectroscopy techniques. First, thermodynamic analysis was applied to investigate the influence of experimental parameters on the products distribution. The optimum operating conditions of PSR based on the thermodynamic analysis were found to be; temperatures 500-700 degrees C, 5 wt% phenol concentration and atmospheric pressure, where higher H-2 yield can be obtained with minimal coke depositions. Next, catalytic performance of Ni/ZnTiO3 for promoting PSR towards H-2 production was conducted in a fixed bed reactor at 700 degrees C and 1 atm. Observably, Ni promoted ZnTiO3 catalyst found very efficient for H-2 yield and selectivity. Utilizing 10% Ni/ZnTiO3 catalyst, phenol conversion of 88.3% with H-2 yield and selectivity of 75.6 and 68.52%, respectively were attained. The stability test exhibited that Ni/ZnTiO3 catalyst kept active over 100 h without obvious deactivation. According to a comparison between thermodynamic analysis and experimental results, it was possible to illustrate deviations regarding the phenol conversion and selective H-2 production. In general, Ni/ZnTiO3 catalyst revealed excellent activity in PSR as a promising material for H-2 production.

AB Recently, bearing health condition monitoring has attracted considerable attention due to its great significance to prolong the lifespan and improve the system reliability of key industrial equipments. For the purpose of improving the reliability and effectiveness of energy harvesting in the monitoring node of industrial equipments, this paper proposes circular Halbach electromagnetic energy harvesters for extracting the electrical energy from the rotational motion of bearings to supply the monitoring units. The magnetic distribution model of the circular Halbach array is derived to investigate the magnetic field enhancement using different arrangement modes and structural parameters. The effect of gap, magnetic shape and distribution radius on the magnetic field is numerically discussed to obtain the proper configuration of circular Halbach array for performance enhancement. The experimental results of the fabricated prototype demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and optimization design for enhancing the energy harvesting performance. Moreover, voltage response and power output under different connection modes of multi-coil are experimentally discussed for increasing efficiency and reducing the cost and difficulty of interface circuits. Under the rotational speed from 600 rpm to 1000 rpm, the proposed harvester can generate the voltage of 2.79-4.59 V and the maximum average power of 50.8-131.1 mW.

AB Developing sintering and carbon resistant tar removal catalysts is crucial for biomass gasification technology. Herein, for the first time, NiCo@NiCo phyllosilicate@CeO2 hollow core shell catalysts have been designed for steam reforming of toluene (SRT) as the biomass tar model compound. They show both good catalytic activity and stability within 45 h of time on stream due to their high sintering resistance of NiCo because of the strong interactions between NiCo and CeO2, high metal exposure as a result of the high specific surface area, high surface metal concentration as well as the high oxygen vacancies as evidenced from the H-2-Temperature-programmed reduction (H-2-TPR), H-2 chemisorption and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterizations respectively. Additionally, the synergistic effect between Ni and Co further improves their carbon resistant property. By comparison, Co@Co phyllosilicate@CeO2 catalysts perform the lowest toluene conversion and stability mainly due to their structural instability during reaction resulting from their high Si/Co ratio, leading to their low specific surface area and Co exposure. The outstanding SRT performance of NiCo@NiCo phyllosilicate@CeO2 catalysts indicates their promising application for steam reforming of biomass tar reaction.

AB Shadow will make power output loss for Building Integrated Photovoltaic system. Power output predicting of Building Integrated Photovoltaic is always complicated due to multi-parameters, especially under partial shading conditions. In this paper, effects of partial shadow on the photocurrent and series resistor is analyzed, relationship of shaded cell area proportion with photocurrent and series resistor is obtained respectively, and based on this, a simplified mathematical model to describe the relationship between shaded cell area proportion and current-voltage, power-voltage characteristics of a photovoltaic module under partial shading conditions is proposed and verified by experiments. Electrical performance of the photovoltaic module under different shading scenarios is predicted using the simplified mathematical model, and the predicted results have a high consistency with experiments using the monocrystalline silicon photovoltaic module. The results show that under same shaded area proportion, the shadow distributing in parallel with the short edge, which makes photovoltaic modules power output 3 W/m(2) under 10% shaded area, has much more negative effects than distributing in parallel with the long edge. The power output of a photovoltaic string protected by one bypass diode depends on the largest shaded cell area proportion, when the largest shaded cell area proportion is around 45%, the photovoltaic string has no contribution to power output of the whole photovoltaic module. Therefore, in order to minimize the influence of shadow on the power output of a photovoltaic module, for Building Integrated Photovoltaic system meeting inevitable shadow with regular shape, the photovoltaic module should be arranged to make the shadow distributed uniformly on the cells protected with one bypass diode; but for Building Integrated Photovoltaic system meeting inevitable shadow with irregular shape, the module of whom every piece of cells parallels a diode is recommended.

AB A methodology is developed to determine the shape of the two dimensional section of wind turbine blades considering the operation of wind turbine under icing conditions. An inverse design process provides the blade shape from a prescribed pressure or velocity distribution, and then the icing of the blade section obtained is simulated under different ambient conditions. The aerodynamic performances of the bare blade and the iced blade are evaluated and compared, which serves as the basis for involving a correction factor in the inverse design process. This correction factor modifies the prescribed velocity distribution so that the blade shape provided by the inverse design process will be applicable under some icing conditions that are chosen according to the prevailing meteorological conditions of the location where the wind turbine is installed. The procedure presented will contribute towards the design of blade shapes that can enable wind turbines to operate under a wide range of ambient conditions satisfactorily.

AB Hybridization of biogas and geothermal energies for power plants can present a promising way to resolve drawbacks of each individual heat source from economic viewpoint, especially when low-temperature geothermal heat source is posited. Concerning this aspect of hybrid renewable heat sources, a novel hybrid biogas-geothermal multigeneration system was proposed in the first part of our study, which was modeled under privilege of thermodynamic laws. In continuation of our previous study, the current study is performed to investigate economic, environmental, and enviroeconomical aspects of the introduced system. Furthermore, single and multi-criteria optimizations of this integrated system are carried out from 4E (energy, exergy, exergoeconomic, and environmental) analysis standpoints. After the optimization, the thermal and exergy efficiencies are raised by 12.07% and 5.16%, respectively, while the overall cost of the product is decreased by 3.7%. Also, the emission rate of the suggested multigeneration system is decreased from 0.1913 kg/kJ to 0.1828 kg/kJ, showing 4.44% reduction in the greenhouse gas emission in comparison with the base mode. From enviroeconomic viewpoint, the environment penalty cost rate is reduced from 147.4 $/h to 144.4 $/h after the optimization. Finally, a comprehensive sensitivity study based on the key economic parameters is performed and results are discussed.

AB The solar absorption-subcooled compression hybrid cooling system (SASCHCS) is subjected to the off-design operation due to the variation of solar irradiance and cooling load. Therefore, the recent design based on the specific condition is difficult to make the system cost-effective in the entire working range. This paper mainly deals with the exergoeconomic design criterion of hybrid system based on the variable working conditions to access the trade-off of investment cost and performance in the whole working condition. The SASCHCS employed in the low-rise building and the high-rise building is considered. Besides, twenty-four cases with different important parameters, i.e., the size of absorption subsystem, condenser and evaporator of compression subsystem as well as isentropic efficiency of compressor, are analyzed in detail. The product cost flow rate and relative cost difference are taken as the decision variables. The exergoeconomic off-design model is developed at first. Subsequently, the decision variables for different temperatures of hot water and cooling water as well as load level is obtained and analyzed. It is found that the difference of the design guideline for the system used in the low-rise building and high-rise building lies in the size of absorption subsystem and condenser, i.e., the lowest scale of absorption chiller is appropriate when the temperature of hot water is less than 75 degrees C for the facility applied in the low-rise building, but the largest size of absorption subsystem is attractive in the entire range of hot water temperature as the hybrid system is used in the high-rise building. This paper is positive for the development of design theory and helpful to design the cost-effective SASCHCS under the entire working range.

AB Hydrotalcite sorbent exhibits a potential capacity of carbon dioxide sorption, which is employed to investigate the ethanol sorption-enhanced reforming process in this work. The Dense Discrete Phase Model (DDPM) is implemented to carry out a three-dimensional simulation of a fluidized bed reactor. The sorption-enhanced effect on reforming performance is discussed. The results reveal that the hydrotalcite-based sorption can greatly improve the hydrogen production and provide the required heat for the reforming process. The influence of particle size distribution is examined. It is found that the bed expansion height is increased considering the particle size distribution. In addition, the impacts of operating pressure and catalyst to sorbent ratio are evaluated. The results show that the increase of pressure and catalyst to sorbent ratio will hinder the hydrogen production.

AB The anaerobic digestion (AD) of municipal biopulp with two macroalgal biomasses (i.e. Saccharin latissima and Focus serrates) was investigated at batch and continuously fed digesters at thermophilic conditions (54 +/- 1 degrees C). At batch mono-digestion tests, municipal biopulp was associated with significantly higher methane production (549 +/- 9 mLCH(4)/gVS) compared to both S. latissima (210 +/- 13 mLCH(4)/gVS) and F. serrates (206 +/- 37 mLCH(4)/gVS). Regarding batch co-digestion tests, the highest methane yield was achieved when the feedstock consisted of 80% VS of biopulp and 20% VS of macroalgal biomass and it corresponded to the single methane contributions. The batch results were confirmed by continuous mode operation experiments, for the mono-digestion of biopulp and subsequently, the co-digestion with S. latissima. A specific challenge encountered with macroalgae biomethanation is the high sodium content. Therefore, mathematical modelling was followed to predict the performance of continuous mode experiments under increased salinity conditions by simulating the addition of more saline feedstock. The experimental results were used to calibrate and validate the model. Modelling simulations revealed that usage of saline feedstocks can drastically inhibit a well-performing AD reactor.

ID BIOGAS; CHINA
AB China has implemented a number of laws and policies to promote the reuse of food wastes generated in restaurants and catering services. Resources in terms of energy and fertilizer are recovered from food wastes. In this study, in order to treat canteen food waste generated inside the campus of Huazhong University of Science and Technology (Wuhan, China), a medium scale biogas plant is designed and then simulated using BioWin software. According to obtained simulation results, the total daily biogas production rate is 2013 m(3)/d and the volatile solids destruction efficiency is about 74%. The campus has about 29 canteens and more than 61,700 students, so it is the ideal place for such a project, because the food waste in this case is concentrated and easy to collect. About 3300 tons of food waste are available per year in HUST, which can be transformed into 1136 MWh of electricity by using a biogas plant with an internal combustion engine. Due to reduced cost of transport and current reduction of taxes for renewable energy plants, the simple payback period of such a project results to be 7.8 years, while the equity payback is 9 years. Sensitivity analysis and risk analysis have shown that project economic feasibility depends strongly on Electricity Export Rate and Initial Investment. A change of these two parameters in the order of 10% can shift equity payback from 9 years to a maximum value of 12.4 years. The development of a Carbon Credit Market can be an important way to increase the economic convenience of this type of projects.

AB The intermittent nature of renewables such as solar and wind necessitates integration with energy-storage to enable realistic applications. The triplex-tube heat exchanger (TTHX) with phase change materials (PCMs) has been found to be a very efficient energy storage application for this purpose. However, the low thermal conductivity of PCMs used makes them unable to give the desired response for storage and recovery. Various techniques like application of fins, metal foams etc. have been explored to solve the problem but focus has been mainly on energy storage and recovery separately, but in real life, the systems operate mostly through simultaneous storage and recovery or charging and discharging (SCD). In this study, performance enhancement of the TTHX with a novel fin configuration under SCD conditions was investigated. Numerical studies were done to investigate performance of the system with different fin geometrical parameters. Optimization was applied using response surface methodology (RSM) to find the optimum fin configuration. The effects of adding aluminum oxide (Al2O3) nanoparticles to the PCM were also investigated. Results indicate that for SCD operations, the proposed optimum fin structure in the TTHX is better than incorporating nanoparticles for the same system's volume usage.

AB This paper develops a combined cooling and power system, which consists of a carbon dioxide Brayton cycle, a dual-pressure organic Rankine cycle and an ejector refrigeration cycle, to recover waste heat from exhaust gas and jacket water in internal combustion engines. Thermodynamic models of the system are performed and exergoeconomic methods are used to calculate the levelized exergy cost of the component products. Effects of seven parameters, including Brayton cycle turbine inlet temperature and inlet pressure, organic Rankine cycle turbine high-pressure side and low-pressure side inlet temperature and ejector primary inlet pressure, are evaluated. Single-objective optimization is carried out by means of genetic algorithm to obtain the minimum levelized exergy cost of system product. Results show that the increase of pressure at Brayton cycle turbine inlet and high-pressure and low-pressure side of the organic Rankine cycle turbine inlet contributes to the decrease of levelized exergy cost of the system product. Optimization results show that minimum levelized exergy cost for system product is 53.25 $ (MWh)(-1). When system product levelized exergy cost is minimum, system net power output, cooling capacity and exergy efficiency are 374.37 kW, 188.63 kW and 37.31%, respectively.

AB Solid heat storage is an attractive solution for a wider utilisation of solar power for domestic and commercial applications alike. Thermal efficiency and long-term stability are of major concern both scientifically and industrially. There are many aspects that influence the thermal performance of a specific solid thermal energy storage (TES), such as the energy storage capacity of its storage material, the characteristics of its heat transfer fluid, and the mechanical integrity of the solid storage medium. In the present study, we develop a thermo-mechanical phase-field approach to fracture in order to examine the thermal performance degradation of the solid sensible heat storage (SHS) caused by potential thermally induced cracking of the heat storage medium around the embedded heat exchangers. Two representative solid SHS structures are examined: one applied in a low-temperature setting, the other used at high temperature levels. In both cases, fracturing caused by the mismatch of thermal expansion coefficients of the storage medium and the heat exchanger occurs under certain conditions. The open fractures form a space that will be filled by a fluid whose nature is determined by the system concept and which may well have a low thermal conductivity. Hence, heat transfer can be disturbed in the damaged regions, causing high temperature anomalies, which further may lead to significant fluctuations/loss of heating power during the heating phase. In the two specific scenarios investigated here, the highest loss of heat flow was estimated to be 7.7% in the water-saturated low-temperature SHS and 20.5% in the high-temperature SHS.

AB This paper conducted a numerical simulation of the thermodynamic cycle of a diesel engine, which runs on diesel/biodiesel mixtures, and takes the processes of compression, combustion and expansion into account. The zero-dimensional mathematical model was adopted in order to build the numerical modeling based on the First Law of Thermodynamics and also of the state equation in order to obtain the pressure and temperature profiles of gases inside the cylinder which vary depending on the angle of the crankshaft. The mathematical modeling included taking account of the transfer of heat through the walls, the energy released during combustion considering the Wiebe function, the thermophysical properties of the reagents and the products and the geometric parameters of the engine. The largest relative error found was the 2% in the pressure which showed a good agreement between the simulated and experimental results from previous studies. A parametric analysis was performed considering the fraction of diesel and biodiesel in the mixture, the start angle of the combustion and the equivalence ratio with a view to assessing their effect on the performance of the engine. The results show that a reduction in temperature and in pressure values was achieved when the biodiesel share in the mixture is increased. This led to altering the values of the performance parameters values. In addition, the peaks of pressure and temperature were increased by raising the equivalence ratio which brings forward the point at which the fuel starts to burn due to the increases in the pressure and maximum temperature. It was verified that Wiebe function parameters have a direct influence not only on the pressure and temperature values but also on the performance data of the engine.

AB The paper is focusing on a shell and plate heat exchanger of a novel absorption refrigeration system. The system is composed of two vacuum vessels connected together with a steam channel and one heat exchanger is located in each vessel. The first heat exchanger is called reactor where working fluid and salt exist and the second heat exchanger or evaporator/condenser (C/E) is where only water exists. The propylene glycol-based (PG) heat transfer fluid is used on the shell side of both heat exchangers as the media to exchange the heat between boilers and reactor in one vessel and between cold environment and condenser/evaporator in another vessel. An experimental test rig was built to investigate the performance of the evaporator/condenser heat exchanger. Then, a three-dimensional (3D) Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model was developed. The experimental result was then used to validate the numerical model developed by using Ansys/Fluent software. A parametric study has been intended to find a more appropriate design for the heat exchanger in order to increase heat transfer performance. Results of the parametric study demonstrated that the cooling performance is doubled by increasing the diameter of the plate from 0.14 m to 0.2 m. In addition, to obtain the maximum heat transfer performance, Reynolds number and distance between plates should be 9 and 0.5 m, respectively. Two correlations have been developed for the outlet temperature and cooling power of the heat exchanger which are functions of heat transfer coefficient. The results of this study can be of vital importance for improving the cooling power of the system, remarkably.

AB A novel heterogeneous bi-functional catalyst namely silicon carbide/sodium hydroxide-graphene oxide (SiC/NaOH-GO) was successfully developed and characterized using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), thermogravimetry analysis (TGA), scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy disperse X-ray analysis (EDX), Brunauer Emmett Teller analysis (BET), X-ray diffraction (XRD), carbon dioxide temperature programmed desorption of carbon dioxide (CO2-TPD) and ammonia temperature programmed-desorption (NH3-TPD). The catalyst was applied in microwave-assisted transesterification and esterification of binary model feedstock (rapeseed oil and oleic acid) containing 20% free fatty acid (FFA) and optimized using respond surface methodology (RSM) based on centre composite design. The study revealed that the optimum reaction conditions were 13:1 wt ratio of SiC/NaOH to GO, 5 wt% of catalyst loading, reaction temperature of 65 degrees C and 6 min reaction time to attain 96% of yield of transesterification and 92% of yield of esterification. Then, the optimized catalyst (13:1 wt ratio of SiC/NaOH) was applied in Chlorella vulgaris lipid with high free fatty acid content (26%) to further confirmed the ability of converting triglycerides and free fatty acid (FFA) to biodiesel simultaneously. The study revealed that 92% of FFA of microalgae lipid was converted and 81% of fatty acid methyl ester content (FAME) was attained under the optimum conditions of methanol to lipid molar ratio of 48, 5 min reaction time, 4 wt% catalyst and reaction temperature of 85 degrees C.

AB Aiming towards discovering a solution for the imminent fossil fuel crisis, the research contributes towards the utilisation of orange peel oil as a potential alternative to mineral diesel while strictly adhering to the emission norms. The study reveals the performance, combustion and emissions characteristics obtained upon operating a 20% by volume of OPO blended with diesel, in a compression ignition engine, integrated with a common rail direct injection (CRDi) system. The fuel injection pressures were varied as 400 bar, 500 bar and 600 bar. Furthermore, two stage injection strategies were employed while varying the pilot charge quantity as 10%, 20% and 30%. Subsequently, 10% EGR was employed for the test with 30% pilot injection quantity upon realising that the respective NOx emissions were the highest for the same. All the results were compared with the test results while utilising diesel at 600 bar injection pressure. For OPO20 the brake thermal efficiency at full load was observed to be 31.37% higher and the brake specific fuel consumption 5.53% lower than that for diesel. In cylinder pressure values recorded were almost similar to diesel corresponding to brake power. Heat release rate was significantly higher in case of orange peel oil. Additionally, it was found that smoke, unburned hydrocarbons content and carbon monoxide emission decreased by 16.30%, 27.63% and 42.28% respectively in the engine exhaust. Oxides of nitrogen were recorded to be 15.46% higher than that of diesel.

AB The heating tower heat pump (HTHP) is proposed as an alternative to the conventional air-source heat pump (ASHP). To investigate the performance improvements of the HTHP over the ASHP, a comprehensive comparison between the two systems was carried out based on a simulation study. Physics-based models for the ASHP and HTHP were developed. The performance of the ASHP under frosting conditions was corrected with a newly developed frosting map, and the regeneration penalization was considered for the HTHP. Based on the models and corrections, hourly simulations were carried out in an office building in Nanjing, China. The results show that the average energy efficiency of the HTHP in summer is 23.1% higher than that of the ASHP due to the water-cooled approach adopted by the HTHP. In winter, the HTHP achieves an increase of 7.4% in efficiency due to the frost free and energy storage characteristics. While the initial cost of the HTHP is 1.2% higher than that of the ASHP, the HTHP can still save 9.7% cost in a 10-year period because of its lower power consumption.

AB The advantages of using supercritical carbon dioxide as working fluid in geothermal development (potential carbon dioxide geological storage and relatively high mobility) have attracted considerable interest in the simulation of a carbon dioxide-based enhanced geothermal system. This study proposed a numerical model based on the three-dimensional unified pipe-network method to simulate the two-phase flow and thermal-hydraulic coupled process in a carbon dioxide-based enhanced geothermal system considering complex fracture networks. The van Genuchten capillary model and relative permeability model are adopted to characterize the displacement process in both the fractures and the rock matrix. A pipe equivalent technique is employed to discretize the governing equations for the two-phase flow and the heat transmission with the local thermal non-equilibrium concept. Two-phase fluid transfer at material interfaces is solved based on a pipe superposition principle in a pipe-network system. Discretized forms are solved by a sequential implicit time scheme alleviating the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition in fracture networks. The proposed model is verified against analytical results for the Buckley-Leverett problem. Saturation evolution curves at different time steps converge to the analytical solutions as the node number increases. Sensitivity analyses using a doublet system horizontally embedded with one large fracture indicate that the capillary contrast between the rock matrix and the fractures and the injection flow rate pose impacts on the produced carbon dioxide saturation and the outlet fluid temperature drawdown. The simulation of circulating processes considering randomly generated fracture networks demonstrates that the more promising potential of heat extraction can be achieved using the pure carbon dioxide as the working fluid instead of cooled water. Analyzing the effects of the initial reservoir carbon dioxide saturation shows that increasing the reservoir carbon dioxide saturation before heat excavation can improve the heat production. Both increase the matrix permeability and the fracture aperture enhances the performance of the heat extraction and the carbon dioxide sequestration.

AB To maximise the utilisation of solar energy and improve the solar fraction for domestic applications, this paper explored the potential of the hybrid solar Photovoltaic/Thermal (PV/T) collector integrated with a thermo-chemical sorption thermal storage system. The thermal output was used to provide domestic hot water or stored over seasons in the England city of Newcastle upon Tyne. The performance of the water-cooled PV/T collectors with or without an air insulation layer between the glass cover and the Photovoltaic (PV) cell was compared. The electrical power generation model of the PV cell developed in MATLAB was coupled with a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model to simulate the simultaneous generation of electrical and thermal energy. The one-diode model was used to simulate the electrical production of the PV cell with the new correlations of the series resistance and the shunt resistance proposed in this work, so that the accuracy of dynamic performance simulation can be improved especially in the cases with relatively higher PV cell temperature. The water outlet temperature was studied at 100 degrees C to meet the heat supply requirement of the sorption cycle using the working pair strontium chloride-ammonia. It was found that the PV/T collector with air gap could produce 28 L hot water per day per m(2) collector (L/(day.m(2))) with the electric efficiency of about 10% if the water outlet temperature was required at 100 degrees C; in contrast, around 133 L/(day.m(2)) was produced with the electric efficiency of 13% when the water outlet temperature at 40 degrees C. The PV/T collector without air gap was not competent for the applications studied in this work especially in cold regions. The application case studies suggested that an installation of 26 m(2) air-gap PV/T collectors integrated with the strontium chloride-ammonia thermochemical sorption storage system can fully satisfy the annual hot water demand of an ordinary single household in Newcastle upon Tyne with 100% solar sources, and cover at least half of the annual electricity consumption.

AB A method is proposed to evaluate, maintain and manage the long-term structural integrity and degradation behavior of offshore wind turbines: the multivariate or copula probability density function with an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system, which completes the assessment and management in three steps. First, the proposed method calculates the statistical population maximum likelihood estimation of the objective probability degradation characteristics and cycling patterns observed for historical precursors. Then, the method uses the Markov chain Monte Carlo method to generate hypothetical probability estimations of the objective features and synthesizes these probability density functions to build multivariate copula probability framework approximations of the features. The proposed method is applied to the integrity assessment and management of in-service offshore wind turbine support structures. Finally, the proposed method uses principal component analysis with a heat map to provide a helpful visualization for integrity assessment and integrity management tools. This method is expected to be embedded in existing supervisory control and data acquisition systems and to be used to construct a global integrity assessment model and management framework. This research shows the multivariate probability pattern of the integrity of an offshore structure under multielement coupling load conditions. A multivariate stochastic simulation is proposed for the goal-oriented integrity assessment, and an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system is used to manage the associated copula probability to quantify the coupling of risk because it uses comprehensive principal component analysis quantification models to describe the multivariate dynamic excitation behaviors of offshore wind turbine support structures. Meanwhile, multivariate hybrid probability frameworks are also shown to have high generalization ability and strong robustness. The proposed methodology also has great potential to be applied to other types of offshore systems for the characterization, assessment, and management of their integrity.

AB This article presents a new energy management system (EMS) for a variety of energy flexibility conversion, routing and storage options in buildings. The EMS uses an efficient nonlinear optimization-based model-predictive control (MPC) method, which achieves low computational complexity by utilizing successive linear programming (SLP) for continuous approximations of discrete (two-level) control problems. Whole-year simulation runs demonstrate that the method is applicable to a residential building system that has multiple energy generation, conversion and storage units with significant nonlinear interactions. Both qualitative and quantitative comparison of the simulation results with a rule-based reference control showed strong dependencies between cost and CO2 emission flexibility goals, energy selling prices and forecasting accuracy. This study shows that significant cost savings can be obtained by taking advantage of energy price fluctuations, increasing the average coefficient of performance (COP) of the heating system, and reducing passive losses in heat storage. In the simulated case study the EMS was able to improve the average COP of a heating system from 2.20 to 2.43-2.74, depending on energy cost assumptions, when compared against a rule-based control (RBC). With a performance bound of perfect forecasting the EMS was able to improve net economic outcome by 38-168%, or by 21-75% of the cost of imported electricity.

AB A new air-cooled gas-steam combined cycle cogeneration system with absorption heat pump for recovering waste heat from exhausted steam of the steam turbine to achieve double effects of waste heat recovery and water saving is proposed based on a conventional water-cooled gas-steam combined cycle cogeneration system in the paper. The property criteria variation is analyzed before and after modification. In addition, the exergy analyses of primary equipments are carried out based upon the exergy analysis theory. The results demonstrate that the net generating power is approximately increased by 11,082 kW, equivalent coal consumption is reduced by 2.71 g/kWh, the net overall thermal efficiency is improved by 0.91% with 334,245 kW heating load at 100% load of the gas turbine in the modified system. Besides, the overall exergy loss is decreased by 6448 kW and exergy efficiency is improved by 0.98%. The overall property of the whole system is improved. The results show that the property reduction caused by air-cooling modification can be made up by the property improvement due to waste heat recovery. Moreover, the cooling circulating water can be saved by 1196.34 kg/s. The presented measure can not only improve performance of the system but also simultaneously achieve energy and water saving on the premise of satisfying user needs, which has a wide application potential in the water-shortage regions.

AB This study summarizes the guidelines for the quality-splitting utilization of the radiation and thermal energy after a brief review of the thermo-photovoltaic (TPV) technology and the power cycles. Based on this, an innovative concept of a system that integrates TPV technology and the Brayton-Rankine combined cycle (TBRC) is first proposed. The basic structure of the new system was modeled and a preliminary thermodynamic analysis was performed. The effects of the working conditions including the combustion conditions of different combustion atmospheres, the oxygen concentrations and fuels, and the cycle conditions of different pressures and working fluids on the TBRC system were investigated. It was found that the optimal pressure of the Brayton cycle in the system increased with the combustion oxygen concentration. The system output power was proportional to the combustion oxygen concentration. The system efficiency was similar under 21% O-2/N-2 conditions and 30% O-2/CO2 conditions. The system efficiency was slightly higher for fuel oil than for methane. After considering the efficiency and environmental impacts, n-pentane was selected as the preferred organic Rankine cycle working fluid. Finally, we discuss the application and development prospects of the new system. It is determined that the oxy-fuel TBRC system with flue gas recycle and the integration between the cascade TPV technology and complex power cycles are future research directions.

AB Reliable and efficient detection of faults in photovoltaic systems provides pertinent information for improving their safety and productivity. However, data gathered from photovoltaic systems are generally tainted with a large amount of noise, which can swamp the most relevant features necessary to detect faults, and ultimately degrades fault detection capability of the monitoring system. Therefore, it is crucial to design a robust fault detection approach to deal with the problem of measurement noise in the data. The purpose of this study is to design a robust fault detection scheme to monitor the direct current side of a photovoltaic system and able to deal with the problem of measurement noise in the data by using multiscale representation. Towards this end, a framework merging the benefits of multiscale representation of data and those of the exponentially-weighted moving average scheme to suitably detect faults is proposed and used in the context of fault detection in photovoltaic systems. Here, multiscale representation of data using wavelets, an efficient feature/noise separation technique, is used to enhance fault detection performance by reducing noise effect and false alarms. First, a simulation model for the monitored photovoltaic array is built. Then residuals from the simulation model are used as the input for the designed scheme for fault detection. A real data from a 9.54 kWp photovoltaic plant in Algiers, Algeria is used to evaluate the effectiveness proposed method. Also, the performance of the proposed chart to that of the conventional exponentially-weighted moving average chart has been compared and found improved sensitivity to faults and robustness to noises.

AB Nowadays, the waste generation increases more and more, especially of the municipal solid waste. The municipal solid waste reject fraction may be valorized from an energy point of view. With this aim, a conceptual design of a process was developed by considering material and energy integration, which mainly consists of three sub-processes: fast pyrolysis of municipal solid waste to produce bio-oil, supercritical water reforming of the bio-oil aqueous phase to produce hydrogen to be used in the third section, which is the upgrading of the organic phase of the bio-oil by hydrodeoxygenation. The overall system was simulated using Aspen Plus software to achieve the highest process performance and the lowest utilities requirement. The former was assessed by the biofuel production (liquefied fuel gas, gasoline and diesel) and the net electrical power. In addition, the potential economic profitability of the plant was performed by specifying the main process units. Thus, for a feeding of 50 t/h of municipal solid waste reject fraction, a generation of a net electric power equal to 10.65 MWe and a production of 5.2 t/h biofuels (21.1% of the carbon present in the municipal solid waste) may be achieved, thus obtaining a very low gate fee (16.7 (sic)/t) using the same industrial selling prices that those of fossil fuels and electricity in a full plant. Therefore, the process seems to be technically and economically feasible.

AB The present work aims at the optimization of fins fitted phase change material equipped photovoltaic system under different working circumstances for proper power enhancement. Setup has been modelled and the best deepness of fins fitted phase change material enclosure has been computed for a range of daily collective solar flux at photovoltaic panel surface, wind pace, wind azimuth, surroundings temperature, melting point, successive fins distance, fins deepness and fins width in order to analyse the influence of working circumstances. It is shown that the change in wind pace from 0.2 m/s to 6 m/s results in reduction of best deepness of phase change material enclosure from 5.2 cm to 3.7 cm, 5.6 cm to 4.0 cm, 5.8 cm to 4.2 cm, 5.9 cm to 4.3 cm and 5.9 cm to 4.3 cm for successive fins distance of 1 m, 1/2 m, 1/3 m, 1/4 m and 1/5 m respectively for daily collective solar flux at photovoltaic panel as 5000Wh/m(2). The change in wind azimuth from 0 degrees to 75 degrees results in increment in the best deepness of enclosure from 3.9 cm to 4.8 cm, 4.3 cm to 5.2 cm, 4.5 cm to 5.4 cm, 4.6 cm to 5.5 cm and 4.6 cm to 5.5 cm for respective fins distances. The power production is increased from 125 W/m(2) to 137 W/m(2), 140 W/m(2), 142 W/m(2), 143 W/m2 and 143 W/m2 with fins width of 0 mm, 0.5 mm, 1 mm, 2 mm and 4 mm respectively.

AB The rapid development of new energy vehicles urgently requires lightweight power battery modules with excellent thermal performance. To achieve this goal, a high thermal conductivity composite phase change materials (CPCM) was prepared and its locally enhanced heat transfer characteristics of power battery module were experimentally studied. The results showed that CPCM had almost the same localized heat transfer effect as copper foam/PCM under different thermal environment. Furthermore, locally enhanced heat transfer char. acteristics have been comparatively studied for center regions with different sizes in the power battery module using the CPCM as cooling media. The results showed that when 4 batteries were enhanced using CPCM, the maximum temperature in a 36-battery module during the 3C discharge was limited to 44.6 degrees C while the maximum temperature difference was limited to 0.8 degrees C. Interestingly, the results revealed that the maximum temperature of battery module was slightly increased (less than 1%) but the temperature difference was reduced by 46.7% compared with enhancement for 16 batteries, which was helpful to improve the temperature consistency of the battery module.

AB Hydrogen utilization and CO2 capture significantly improve the environment. In order to reduce the energy penalty of hydrogen production and CO2 capture, the idea of this work is to integrate the hydrogen production and CO2 capture. Here, the recyclable electro-driven process of CO2 capture and indirect H2O electrolysis was developed. In the process, the energy recovery system was developed to utilize the reaction heat. The non-neutral Ni based catalyst with single-atom catalysis was designed. DFT model and energy recovery model were developed. The turnover frequency, transmission value, electron density, band structure, reaction kinetics of hydrogen production and CO2 desorption were determined. A mechanism of second dehydrogenation and second hydrogen release was identified for the non-neutral catalysis. Non-neutral NiAlTiR + catalyst enhanced the electron transport and made electron dense region extend to the single atom zone. The 90% yield of hydrogen was produced due to the fast electron transport. The well regenerated catalyst during the 25 cycles produced the 80-90% turnover frequency and transmission compared with the fresh catalyst. The non-neutral catalyst, catalyst regeneration and reaction energy recovery reduced the energy consumption for H-2 production and CO2 capture to 0.4 V and 1 GJ/t.

AB Modified serially linked serpentine flow fields are proposed for proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) and their performances are numerically studied. The effects of the segment number and the channel path number on the cell performance are analyzed. Especially The effect of the secondary flow on the cell performance is particularly discussed. Numerical results indicate that the modified serpentine flow fields can obviously improve the cell performance in comparison with the parallel flow field. The cell performances can be improved by increasing the segment number or the channel path number in each segment. The reactant transport under the rib and the secondary flow in the channel are considered as the main causes for the high cell performance of PEMFC with modified serpentine flow fields. The secondary flow can be generated by the combination of the under-rib flow and the serpentine turn. In comparison with the parallel flow field, the modified serpentine flow fields have higher average oxygen concentration but lower uniformity of the oxygen concentration distribution.

AB This paper deals with a review on exergy analyses of lithium bromide-water based single to triple effect direct and indirect fired vapour absorption systems. The analysis carried out by various investigators on exergy of the absorption cycles have been discussed. To fill the gap in the knowledge on exergy destruction rate in the absorption system, optimization of the single to triple effect direct and indirect fired absorption cycles have been conducted for a wide range of operating conditions. Hence optimum parameters in various components of the systems for maximum exergy coefficient of performance and minimum exergy destruction rate have been determined. The indirect fired systems have been optimized for different temperatures of the energy source related to the main generator temperature. While the direct fired systems have been optimized considering exergy destruction rate during the combustion process of energy sources. The energy sources selected in the present analysis are compressed natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas. Double effect cycle yields better exergy performance when the difference in temperatures of the energy source and the generator is between 6 to 37 degrees C, while triple effect cycle performs well when it is beyond 37 degrees C.

AB In this paper, secondary solar action to biomass, focused on the conceptualized intersection of solar energy and biomass, is presented to illustrate how "breaking" of biomass to biofuels plus hydrogen can be utilized for the adaptation of Solar Thermal Electrochemical Process (STEP) chemistry. This Solar Thermal Electrochemical Process (STEP) system was designed and employed for the synergetic solar energy and corresponding chemistry to provide an action of biomass for efficient solar and biomass utilization-production of biofuels plus hydrogen. The control and modulation of solar fields and sub-chemical reactions were adopted to achieve a high utilization of solar energy, high chemical conversion rate, and high selectivity of the biomass to achieve rich biofuels and abundant hydrogen. The Solar Thermal Electrochemical Process (STEP) temperature of the breakdown reaction was greatly lowered by using electrolysis, as compared with the conventional pyrolysis. Based on their structural complexity and thermal stability, cellulose and lignin are well-suited for the production of biofuel and hydrogen. Through the coupling of thermolysis and electrolysis, the Solar Thermal Electrochemical Process (STEP) hydrogen production from cellulose was 7.2 times higher under a current of 100 mA and 8.8 times higher at 400 mA compared with pyrolysis at 200 degrees C. The Solar Thermal Electrochemical Process (STEP) lignin conversions were significantly improved by reaching 87.22%, 21.78%, 57.72%, and 7.22% (340 degrees C, 400 mA), while the pyrolysis achieved only 52.39%, 19.48%, 25.81%, and 7.10% (340 degrees C, 0 mA), respectively, for the total rate, solid, liquid, and gas fractions. With electrochemical synergy to help, the Solar Thermal Electrochemical Process (STEP) process efficiently and selectively produced gas hydrocarbons, liquid biofuel, and hydrogen. The light hydrocarbons in the gas phase, such as methane, ethane, and n-pentane, became more abundant via thermoelectrolysis.
   The Solar Thermal Electrochemical Process (STEP) chemistry for converting biomass to biofuels and hydrogen was also elucidated in this paper. The simplified mechanism can best be described by a series of thermo/electroinduced free radical reactions. The system, built on solar energy and specific chemical reactions, features a perfect, green, sustainable, and recyclable operation to transform solar biomass to biofuels and hydrogen.

AB Horse manure is a biowaste with bioenergy recovery potential for heat and power generation. However, there is no kinetics data in literature to date. In this work, a kinetic study of the pyrolysis process of horse manure is investigated through the use of thermogravimetric analyses. The samples were heated over a range of temperature from 298 to 927 K with four different heating rates of 1, 2, 5 and 10 K/min. The weight loss was measured by a thermogravimetric analyser in an inert atmosphere. The differential thermal gravimetric (DTG) thermogram shows that the highest reaction rate occurred at between 290.2 and 329.6 degrees C where the devolatilisation process was initiated to overcome the activation energy barrier of the manure. The activation energy and pre-exponential factor obtained by the Kissinger method, assumed to be constant throughout the whole pyrolysis process are 149 kJ/mol and 3.3 x 10(12) s(-1), respectively. The activation energy calculated from the non-isothermal Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (FWO), Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS) and Friedman methods are 199.3, 200.2 and 194.6 kJ/mol, whereas the pre-exponential values are 9.3 x 10(18), 1.8 x 10(19) and 3.6 x 10(20) s(-1), respectively. The kinetic parameters determined based on interval conversional fraction shows good agreement. The high volatile and low ash content in horse manure indicates the potential for bioenergy recovery. The results of the kinetic study can be used for modelling devolatilisation and designing thermochemical conversion processes.

AB In this paper, a hybrid energy storage system based on integrated thermochemical and compressed air energy storage is proposed. This hybrid system can store energy from wind, solar and/or off-peak electricity simultaneously. In the energy charging process, the concentrated solar heat is used to provide heat for the endothermal reduction of tricobalt tetroxide to cobalt monoxide. Meanwhile, wind energy is employed to drive a series of compressors for compressing the input ambient air. The products (cobalt monoxide and compressed air) are then stored temporarily. In the energy discharging process, the compressed air is released to oxidize cobalt monoxide which generates high-quality heat. The superheated and pressurized air is then used for electricity generation via air turbines. In conventional compressed air energy storage, natural gas is employed for superheating the compressed air. By contrast, the proposed hybrid system completely eliminates the use of fossil fuel and replaces it with the exothermal oxidation heat of cobalt monoxide, which originates from solar energy. Moreover, cobalt oxides can be stored at ambient temperature for an extended period without any insulation requirements, which renders the system to be a long-term energy storage solution. According to the thermodynamic analysis, the hybrid system can achieve a round trip efficiency of 56.4% with an energy storage density of 3.9?kWh/m(3). Meanwhile, the proposed system has an overall exergy efficiency of 75.6% with the largest exergy destruction process taking place in the intercoolers. The sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the round trip efficiency is mostly sensitive to the reactivity of cobalt monoxide, the isentropic efficiency of compressors and turbines, and cavern operating pressures.

AB MgO-Al2O3-SiO2 glass-ceramics were prepared by melting method. The effects of replacement of Na2O by Fe2O3 on crystallization behavior and acid resistance of glass-ceramics were studied. The results showed that with Fe2O3 addition, the crystallization peak around 860 degrees C increased firstly and then decreased, while the peak around 1120 degrees C showed opposite changes. The crystallization peak around 1000 degrees C shiftted to low temperatures. With heat treatment temperature increasing from 880 to 1200 degrees C, p-cordierite, spinel, sapphirine and alpha-cordierite precipitated successively in the glass samples. Fe2O3 had little effect on the type of crystal phases, but had a great influence on their crystallinity and precipitation temperature. After heat treatment at 1200 degrees C, the main crystalline phase changed from mu-cordierite to alpha-cordierite for the glass sample without Fe2O3. The addition of Fe2O3 promoted the crystallization of alpha-cordierite at low temperatures, especially for 1 mol% Fe2O3 doped sample, alpha-cordierite obviously precipitated at 1100 degrees C. All the base glass samples had poor acid resistance, which was greatly improved by heat treatment. When honeycomb structure alpha-cordierite appeared as the main crystalline phase, acid resistance deteriorated rapidly. A small amount of Fe2O3 addition reduced the acid resistance. With Fe2O3 content increasing, the acid resistance gradually improved.

AB Differential scanning calorimeter in non-isothermal mode has been used to study the effect of addition of Hf, in place of Zr, on the glass forming ability and thermal stability of metallic glasses of composition Fe57.2Co30.8Zr7-xHfxB4Cu1 (x = 3, 5, and 7). An increase in the content of Hf results in an increase in the primary crystallization temperature and melting temperature. The activation energy of glass transition and primary crystallization was determined using commonly used thermo-analytical models. Relatively higher activation energy was seen in sample with lowest Hf content both for the glass transition and primary crystallization processes. An increase in Hf content showed a decline in thermal stability and glass forming ability assessed through fragility index, temperature range of super cooled liquid region, and other frequently used theoretical parameters. The role of Hf in this alloy system has been rationalized on the basis of these observations.

AB The time evolutions of transient current data for As2Te3(In) thin films were measured at different electric fields for the dc voltages of 0.001 V, 0.002 V, 0.005 V, 0.01 V, 0.1 V, 0.5 V and 1 V at room temperature (296 K). Transient current was analyzed by means of time series analysis in order to identify different conduction regimes. The maximal Lyapunov exponents for the transient currents were calculated. Positive maximal Lyapunov exponents reflected electric field dependence with positive Lyapunov exponents. Existence of a positive Lyapunov exponent means sensitive dependence on initial conditions and As2Te3(In) is known to have memory effects hence different initial conditions for each dc current measurement. Detrended Fluctuation Analysis was utilized to characterize the behavior of de current time series which is invariant to initial conditions. Detrended Fluctuation Analysis identified three different conduction regimes with multiple conduction mechanisms.

AB The construction of realistic atomistic models for amorphous solids is complicated by the fact that they do not have a unique structure. Among the different computational procedures available for this purpose, the melting and rapid quenching process using molecular dynamics simulations is commonly employed as it is simple and physically based. Nevertheless, the cooling rate used during quenching strongly affects the reliability of generated samples, as fast cooling rates result in unrealistic atomistic models. In this study, we have determined the conditions to be fulfilled when simulating the quenching process with molecular dynamics for obtaining amorphous Si (alpha-Si) atomistic models structurally compatible with experimental samples. We have analyzed the structure of samples generated with cooling rates ranging from 3.3 10(10) to 8.5 10(14) K/s. The obtained results were compared with experimental data available in the literature, and with samples generated by other state-of-the-art and more sophisticated computational procedures. For cooling rates below 10(11) K/s, alpha-Si samples generated had structural parameters within the range of experimental samples, and comparable to those obtained from other refined modeling procedures. These computationally slow cooling rates are of the same order of magnitude than those experimentally achieved with pulsed energy melting techniques. Samples obtained with faster cooling rates can be further relaxed with annealing simulations, resulting in structural parameters within the range of experimental samples. Nevertheless, the required annealing times are on the order of microseconds, which makes this annealing step non practical from a computational point of view.

AB The microstructure of porous glass has been studied by using electron microscopy and X-ray microanalysis. Porous glass has an average pore size of about 4 nm in its interior, while larger pores and channels, up to 40 nm in size, exist in a surface layer, which is about 200 nm in thickness. Transparent consolidated samples with a bismuth concentration in the range <= 0.01-0.8 at. % were prepared by impregnation of porous glass with an aqueous solution of bismuth nitrate followed by thermal treatment. The addition of aluminum nitrates to the soaking solution results in the reduction of the bismuth content in the samples. The composition inhomogeneity of the porous glass and nanocrystalline inclusions were investigated on the nanolevel by means of transmission electron microscopy. The luminescence spectra of the samples were typical for aluminosilicate host glasses. The luminescence bands had the same shape in the entire bismuth concentration range from <= 0.01 to 0.8 at.%. The band intensities depend on the bismuth concentration and reach their maxima at 0.1-0.5 at.%.

AB Novel Fe83.3Si4B8P4-xCxCuo.7 (x = 0-4) alloys were developed with the aim of increasing amorphous forming ability (AFA) without deteriorating the soft magnetic properties. Microstructure analysis revealed that the substitution of C for P inhibited the precipitation of alpha-Fe phase during the quenching process hence increased the AFA. The critical thickness increased from 18 gm for the alloys with composition of x = 0 to 43 mu m for x = 4, respectively, owing to the decrease in the melting entropy (Delta S-m), the approach of eutectic point and micro alloying effect. Saturation magnetic flux density (B-s) increased obviously after proper annealing with increasing C substitution due to the increase in volume fraction of alpha-Fe nanocrystals, while excessive C content leaded larger coercivity (H-c) but improved the frequency and DC superposition performance. The Fe83.3Si4B8P2C2Cu0.7 nanocrystalline alloy was successfully synthesized with high B-s of 1.84 T, low H-c of 4.8 A/m and high effective permeability (mu(e)) of 13,540. The combination of high B-s and high resistance to DC bias promises potential material in DC superposition application.

AB To investigate the intrinsic effect of the pre-stress (sigma(pre)) on the onset of yielding, nanoindentation experiments are performed on two metallic glasses (MGs) which are elastically-bent and constrained within a home-made apparatus. Statistical calculations for the first pop-ins are made and noticeable decrease in maximum shear stress (tau(max)) is observed under tensile pre-stress, but only slight increase under compressive one, without considering the pre-stress effect on the ratio (0.29) of tau(max) to the maximum contact pressure (p(0)). This asymmetry phenomenon is related to the anharmonic and asymmetric nature of the interatomic interaction potential caused by the applied pre-stress. Moreover, finite-element analysis is conducted to obtain the elastic stress field of the prestressed region upon indentation, which becomes anisotropy and quarter-symmetric. tau(max) for the specimen is defined as 0.29p(0) + 0.50 sigma(pre) for the tensile-stressed region and 0.29p(0) for the compressive-stressed region within elastic strain limit of MGs, which requires the correction for the intrinsic tau(max) with tensile sigma(pre), but not for compressive sigma(pre). The corrected tau(max) and activation energy barrier of shear transformation zone are found to be independent on sigma(pre), suggesting that the intrinsic shear stress is a constant and the yielding of MGs obeys the maximum shear stress criterion.

AB Glasses based on SiO2-PbO-CdO-Ga2O3 system have been studied for the first time for fabrication of mid-infrared optical elements. Gallium oxide concentration was gradually increased, replacing silicon dioxide, for different cadmium and lead oxide content. The thermal and optical properties were investigated for different compositions. It was observed that the thermal stability, refractive index, and the transmission in the infrared range increased with increase of gallium and lead concentrations. The most thermally stable glass composition was selected for fabrication of optical elements such as optical fibers. We also successfully fabricated mid-infrared lenses by hot embossing for potential application in compact gas detectors.

AB In this study, Fe-based amorphous coatings on 304 stainless steel surfaces were fabricated by high velocity oxy-fuel. The microhardness of the coatings was about 3.5 times than that of the substrate. Furthermore, the effect of the holding time on the creep deformation behavior of Fe-based amorphous coatings was investigated by performing nanoindentation creep experiments. Experimental results demonstrate that compared with holding time the creep deformation more sensitive to the applied peak load. At the same holding time, the stress exponent(n) at the high peak load is smaller than lower one, the stress exponent value decreases at the same peak load with the prolonging of holding time, higher stress exponent value indicates amorphous coatings have more resistance to creep deformation in the condition of smaller peak and holding time.

AB Study of glasses with a high content of rare earth elements has a particular interest due to their use in nuclear waste storage. New glass matrices are required to immobilize even higher concentrations of high-level waste in comparison to borosilicate glasses already used. We study the effect of aluminum/boron substitution on the structure of peraluminous lanthanum-rich sodium aluminoborosilicate glasses of 55SiO(2)-(25-x)Al2O3-xB(2)O(3)-15Na(2)O-5La(2)O(3) composition, where lanthanum simulate all the lanthanides as well as the minor actinides typical for the high-level waste. We have here chosen a chemical composition of a model glass that can accept the presence of minor actinides among the fission products generated by the new reactors of the fourth generation.
   Transmission Electron Microscopy, Differential Scanning Calorimetry, X-ray diffraction and Infrared spectroscopy showed the existence of phase separation at high boron oxide concentrations, and finely characterized the structure of the major vitreous network.

AB In this paper, a kind of silica gel was applied to improve the mechanical properties of silica aerogel/glass fiber composite without compromising its thermal conductivity. The composite was prepared by acid-base catalyzed tetraethylorthosilicate sol-gel followed by supercritical CO2 drying, in which the silica gel was impregnated. The effects of the silica gel on the thermal conductivity and strength of the composite were investigated. The results indicated that the composite possessed not only ultra-low thermal conductivity of 0.0179 W.(m.K)(-1), but also excellent mechanical strain and low bulk density of 0.246 g/cm(3), and was dust-free. It was demonstrated that the impregnated silica gel filled in the gap between the glass fibers and anchored the silica aerogel on the glass fiber tightly via the -Si-O-Si- network, which not only prevented the heat transfer but also trapped and protected the silica aerogel from collapsing. This new approach shed light on solving the big issue of the silica aerogel in practical application due to its brittle and dust-drop.

AB The production of chalcogenide microstructured optical fibers with low optical losses, due to the broad transparency window of these glasses in the mid-IR, can allow for new breakthroughs in various research fields, e.g. new mid-IR laser sources and mid-IR spectroscopy. In this framework, high purity chalcogenide glasses are needed in order to minimize absorption losses. In this study, Ge10As22Se68 samples were prepared using a double distillation method, using different combinations of chlorides and metals as getters for the physico-chemical elimination of carbon, oxygen and hydrogen impurities. Comparing the attenuation spectra of the different samples, the choice of the getters seems to be indeed a significant factor in the quality of the glass. A holey fiber has been realized by casting method using the best sample, showing that the method is suitable for this composition and that the attenuation before and after the casting are comparable.

AB Praseodymium (Pr3+) doped silica glass with varying Aluminum (Al3+) concentrations have been prepared using sol-gel technique. The glass samples produced have density (2.2 g/cm(3)) and refractive index (1.46) similar to that of fused silica. Judd-Ofelt parameters Omega(2), Omega(4) and Omega(6) were obtained from the absorption spectrum in the visible region and used to calculate line strengths of transitions involved in cross-relaxation. Analyses of cross relaxation mechanisms suggest higher probability for the D-1(2) state. Photoluminescence emissions in the visible and NIR region were observed under 450 nm excitation. Slow annealing to 1000 degrees C minimizes hydroxyl quenching by reducing hydroxyl content thereby improving the luminescence. Al3+ co-doping also significantly enhance the luminescence, especially the D-1(2) emission which is evidence of reduction in cross-relaxation.

ID PHOSPHATE; VISCOSITY; STABILITY; KINETICS; POWDER
AB The glass forming ability of inorganic substances has traditionally been evaluated in kinetic terms related to the rate of spontaneous crystallization of their melts, which is related to viscosity from the macroscopic point of view. However, differences or similarities between the local structures of glasses and crystals of the same composition could have an additional influence on the kinetic ability to form a stable glass or a crystal from a melt. In this work, the local structure of alkali metaphosphate glasses and crystals has been analyzed by means of P-31 MAS-NMR to demonstrate that the ability to form a glass is directly related to the differences between the atomic organization in the glassy states and the structure of the stable crystals at lower temperatures. This implies that chemical compositions having a similar atomic order in their glass and crystal structures will not easily develop the disordered long-range structure of glass.

AB Evolution of free-volume atomic scale structure under crystal-to-glass transition was re-examined in arsenic trisulfide As2S3 in glassy and crystalline state, employing mutually correlated positron annihilation lifetime studies treated in a framework of two-state simple positron trapping model. In crystalline state represented by mineral orpiment As2S3 supplied from Wanshan mine (China), the trapping rate is restricted to similar to 1.14 ns(-1), associated with 0.240 ns defect-free bulk and 0.402 ns defect-specific lifetimes due to free volumes stabilized preferentially within inter-layer spaces. The positron trapping rate is notably enhanced to similar to 1.51 ns(-1) in glassy state presented by melt-quenched As2S3, the positron traps being smaller with decreased bulk (0.278 ns) and defect (0.380 ns) lifetimes due to nanostructurized free volumes stabilized within corrugated quasi-layers. In general, vitrification in As2S3 produces depressing and time-enhancing trend in the recorded PAL spectra peaks. The ratio of bulk positron lifetimes for glassy and crystalline states serving as criterion of vitrification completeness reaches 1.16, meaning that some additional volume is available for annihilation in a glass. The ratio of mean positron lifetimes approaching 1.12 reflects a degree of realized crystal-to-glass transformation. Vitrification-related changes in As2S3 can be imagined as fragmentation of existing free-volume voids due to crumpling of intrinsic inter-layer spaces.

AB We report on the synthesis of poly(styrene sulphonate) (PSS) doped with iron ions (PSS:Fe) and its electrical properties in J-Field Effect Transistors (J-FET). PSS:Fe films exhibited enhanced ferroelectric and conductance in comparison with non-doped PSS films, with a conductivity of 4.47 10(-6) S/m. In comparison with traditional ferroelectric polymers, such as poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene) [P(VDF-TrFE)], PSS:Fe films had coercive fields three orders of magnitude smaller and remnant polarization six orders of magnitude higher. When operated with a negative gate voltage (V-G), the drain current (I-D) increased significantly, while positive gate voltages reduced the conductor channel and decreased I-D. The proposed in-plane geometry with PSS:Fe monolayer films exhibits suitable ferroeletricity characteristics.

AB Aluminoborosilicate glasses with different contents of Y2O3 were prepared by the conventional melt-annealing method. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), differential thermal analysis (DTA) and impedance instrument were used to investigate structure, thermal and dielectric properties of glass samples. The infrared spectrum analysis showed that the structure of aluminoborosilicate glasses became compact firstly and then loss with the increase of Y2O3. Oxygen molar volume (V-o) and molar volume (V-m) of the glass samples reached the minimum with 2 mol% Y2O3 addition, which indicated this sample had the more compact and dense glass network structure. The glass transition temperature (T-g), onset glass crystallization temperature (T-c) and crystallization peak temperature (T-p) had an upward trend with the addition of Y2O3. When Y2O3 content was 2.0 mol%, the maximum value of Dietzel's thermal stability (Delta T) and the Saad parameter (S) were 161 degrees C and 15.58 degrees C respectively. This meant that the thermal stability was enhanced by adding Y2O3, and the sample contained 2.0 mol% Y2O3 had excellent thermal stability. The dielectric constant decreased to the minimum value (4.7) with the addition of 1.5 mol% Y2O3, and the dielectric loss met the minimum (3.8 x 10(-4)) when the content of Y2O3 reached 2.0 mol%.

AB A transparent composite material consisting of a soda-lime-silicate glass matrix containing up to 0.5 %(w) gold nanoparticles (10 to 20 nm) was successfully obtained by coating glass grains and a subsequent sintering using a spark plasma sintering (SPS) furnace. Coating was achieved thanks to the reduction of gold(III) chloride trihydrate by sodium borohydride in an ethanol solution. The sintered composites were dense and transparent, but for the largest gold content where the sample exhibits a deep red color. When submitted to laser irradiation (532 nm, up to 100 W/cm(2)), the composite experiences a fast, localized and much more significant increase of its temperature in comparison with the pristine glass material. A temperature as high as 550 degrees C was reached, allowing the healing of surface crack.

AB Objective: The objective of this study was to establish the overall remineralizing potential of bioactive glasses which were specifically designed to be incorporated in dental varnishes. This study evaluates the in vitro ability of bioactive glasses (BAGs) to release ions including: fluoride, calcium, strontium and phosphate and to form apatite when immersed in Tris buffer solution, and also investigates the effect of increasing strontium substitution for calcium on remineralization potential.
   Materials and methods: A melt-derived bioactive glass series was formulated (SiO2-Na2O-CaO-P2O5-CaF2) with progressive (0-100%) replacement of calcium (Ca) with strontium (Sr) and prepared. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were utilised before and after immersion for specific time periods (0, 3, 6, 24, 72, 168 h) in 50 ml Tris buffer solution at 37 degrees C. A fluoride-ISE was used to measure the concentration of fluoride, whilst inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) was used to measure the concentration of phosphorus, calcium and strontium in the solutions.
   Results: The FTIR and XRD data indicated the amorphous nature of all unreacted bioactive glasses, except for the high Sr-substituted glasses, which crystallised to fluorapatite. Degradation of all the glass powders resulted in fluoride, phosphate and calcium/strontium ion release. All the glasses formed apatite on immersion. Ion release enhanced significantly in the three compositions with 50% SrO substituted for CaO, while calcium ion release was greater for low SrO substitutions.
   Conclusion: Ion release data obtained for the new compositions of novel bioactive glasses to be incorporated into varnishes have promise in the prevent and/or treatment of white spot lesions through the release of fluoride, phosphate and calcium/strontium.

AB The structural relaxation, potential energy states, and mechanical properties of a model glass subjected to thermal cycling are investigated using molecular dynamics simulations. We study a non-additive binary mixture which is annealed with different cooling rates from the liquid phase to a low temperature well below the glass transition. The thermal treatment is applied by repeatedly heating and cooling the system at constant pressure, thus temporarily inducing internal stresses upon thermal expansion. We find that poorly annealed glasses are relocated to progressively lower levels of potential energy over consecutive cycles, whereas well annealed glasses can be rejuvenated at sufficiently large amplitudes of thermal cycling. Moreover, the lowest levels of potential energy after one hundred cycles are detected at a certain temperature amplitude for all cooling rates. The structural transition to different energy states is accompanied by collective nonaffine displacements of atoms that are organized into clusters, whose typical size becomes larger with increasing cooling rate or temperature amplitude. We show that the elastic modulus and the peak value of the stress overshoot exhibit distinct maxima at the cycling amplitude, which corresponds to the minimum of the potential energy. The simulation results indicate that the yielding peak as a function of the cycling amplitude for quickly annealed glasses represents a lower bound for the maximum stress in glasses prepared with lower cooling rates.

AB CaO-P2O5-SiO2-Li2O-Fe2O3 magnetic bioactive glasses were prepared through an optimized sol-gel method. This study was emphasized on the effects of magnetic content addition on the bioactive glass properties. As the need arises, we study synthesized magnetic bioactive glass physical, rheological, and biocompatible properties. The morphology and composition of these glasses were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The particle size was also determined using a laser particle size analyzer (LPSA). The thermal measurements were put through using Differential thermal analysis (DTA). In order to evaluate the in-vitro bioactivity of synthesized glasses, the ability for apatite formation on their surface upon their immersion in simulated body fluid (SBF) was checked using SEM, EDX and pH measurements. Moreover, the Ca, Si, Li and Fe ions in SBF were monitored using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). The results showed that the addition of Li and Fe in the glass composition affect the formation of apatite layer onto the glass surfaces. Morphologies of the apatite layers were also different in which the bioactivity was declining with increasing Fe concentration, but the increase of Li concentration led to an increase in bioactivity, yet all of the synthesized glasses are still highly bioactive. Finally, the research proved that the synthesized magnetic bioactive glasses are nontoxic and biocompatible and they can be used as thermoseeds for cancer hyperthermia studies.

AB Chalcogenide glasses are renowned inorganic materials with remarkable applications in the field of optoelectronics. In this work concentration dependent thermal diffusivity of Ge25Se65Sb10 and Ge25Se65Sb10Ag5 chalcogenide glass nanocolloids have been analysed using dual beam thermal lens technique. Nanocolloids of five different concentrations from each composition were prepared by dissolving finely powdered bulk glasses in organic solvent ethylenediamine (EDA). Enhancement in thermal diffusivity observed with increase in solute concentration is attributed to increased number of localised defects states, phonon scattering at particle liquid interface and Brownian motion of the particles. Chalcogenide nanocolloids also exhibit improved thermal diffusivity on incorporating silver to the glass matrix by replacing selenium. Results are discussed on the basis of factors such as increased nanoparticle surface area, microconvection, nanoparticle clustering, increased network connectivity and rigidity etc.

AB Ternary tellurite glasses with composition 20WO(3)-xBi(2)O(3)- (80-x) TeO2 (x = 10, 15, 20 and 25 mol%) were synthesized by conventional quenching method from pure oxides. Amorphous state of the prepared samples was checked by X-ray diffraction. The variation in the density values (rho) and molar volume (V-m) oxygen packing density (OPD) and ion concentration (N) showed the influence of Bi2O3 on glass structure. The various optical properties such as optical band gap (E-opt), refractive index (n), molar refraction (R-m), cationic polarizability (alpha(m)) and optical basicity (boolean AND) were calculated and are discussed in terms of structural changes. These optical properties have been observed to vary with Bi2O3 concentration. FTIR investigation shows the glasses contain TeO4, BiO6 and WO4 basic structural units. Additionally, different shielding parameters such as effective atomic number, radiation protection efficiency, mean free path, half value layer and exposure buildup factor were calculated in order to effectively use these glasses simultaneously in optical-based devices with high radiation shielding performance. The results showed that the mass attenuation coefficient and effective atomic number values of WTBi4 glass sample which contains the higher Bi2O3 concentration were the maximum at the selected energies. The mean free path of the prepared glasses was compared to different glasses, while the half value layer of the prepared glasses was compared to different types of concretes.

The DSC curves for all samples presented the glass transition phenomenon (T-g), while the XRD patterns showed the presence of an amorphous halo, which confirmed the glassy nature of all samples analyzed. UV-Vis spectra of the glasses showed a transparent window from 450 to 800 nm. The EPR signals intensities were investigated as a function of the copper concentration and Sb2O3 content in the (PySb0.5Cu) (20 <= y <= 80) and (PSb80xCu) (0.25 <= x <= 1.25) glasses. The EPR results showed that the increase of Sb2O3 concentration on the PySb0.5Cu glasses decreased the Cu2+ signals, which suggests the Sb3+ oxidizing to Sb5+, also transferring electrons to Cu2+ species to create the EPR a silent Cu+ specie. According to EPR parameters and PL spectra (excited at 380 nm) of PySb0.5Cu glasses, the ions Cu2+ ions were preferentially found in a distorted octahedral geometry, while Cu+ is in a square planar geometry according to the Jahn-Teller effect.

AB In this paper, we investigate the visco-plastic stress response of vitreous silica under tension using molecular dynamics simulations. Firstly, we show significant rate-dependence by alternately subjecting vitreous silica to loading and relaxation. Using this strategy, we eliminate viscous effects, a quasi-static hysteresis is obtained and remaining plastic deformations are observed. We investigate the medium-range order at various deformation states on the quasi-static hysteresis. We demonstrate that, although, the short-range order does not noticeably differ at various deformation states on the quasi-static hysteresis, the medium-range order, evaluated through the ring statistics, shows significant changes. Based on the observation of similar trends regarding the ring statistics, three groups, i.e. small-, medium- and large-sized rings, are classified and their changes are linked to the plastic behavior. Furthermore, in order to link the medium range order to rate-dependence, changes in the ring statistics, caused through mechanical relaxation, are investigated and discussed.

AB Liquid structure of Al-Si alloy is a long-standing issue. Using the newly-developed Al-Si potential, we studied the liquid structure of Al-10.3 wt% Si alloy by molecular dynamics simulation for the first time. We found that Al and Si atoms tend to be well mixed and the aggregation of Si-rich clusters is weak. The results exclude the possibility of regarding the aggregation of Si-rich clusters as the origin of the hysteresis in liquid Al-Si alloy. We didn't find obvious abrupt structure change in liquid A1-10.3 wt% Si near the melting point of Al.

AB Nowadays, various materials have been used as drug delivery systems (DDSs). In this study, Poly (vinyl alcohol) nanofibers and films were used as an organic drug carriers and silica-aerogel as a mineral drug carrier. The physicochemical properties and also drug release of prepared samples were investigated from appropriate tests. The results of low-temperature N-2 adsorption/desorption analysis showed the drug molecules have been trapped in the aerogel pores. The results of drug release showed the drug loaded samples, especially the silica aerogel, have a faster release, due to a high surface area and high porosity rather than the crystalline form of the drug. About 80% of the fluconazole loaded on silica aerogel was released in 60 min, while this amount of the pure fluconazole was released in 225 min. As well as, in vitro test was performed by disc diffusion method that the drug loaded silica aerogel and Poly (vinyl alcohol) film showed a significant effect on the destruction of the fungal.

AB The correlations between the average linear thermal expansion coefficient < alpha > and glass transition temperature T-g and between GV(m) (G is shear modulus and V-m is molar volume) and T-g for a variety of metallic glasses (MGs) were investigated. A Lindemann-like equation, < alpha > x T-g = 0.75 x 10(-2), is observed, indicating that the glass transition of MGs follows Lindemann-like rule. The relationship provides a new perspective to understand the mechanism of glass transition and a simple method to predict T-g for a given MG. Additionally, T-g is found to vary linearly with GV(m), implying that an inherent relevance between glass transition and plastic deformation of MGs.

AB Residual stress measurements by fluorescence microscopy is a well-established technique which uses the R-1 and/or R-2 fluorescence peaks of Cr+3 ions in Al2O3. These peaks are sensitive to the distortion of the lattice and their position changes if the crystal is stressed. Borosilicate (BS) and soda-lime (SL) composites with 10 vol% Al2O3 were produced mixing the glass and alumina powders, uniaxially compressed and sintered at high temperature. Surface morphology and microstructure were characterized by optical and scanning electron microscopies. The porosity obtained was < 2%. 10 N Vickers indentations were performed and the stresses around the indentations were measured by fluorescence microscopy. Measurements of residual stresses, due to thermal expansion mismatch between the glass matrix and the Al2O3, were 163 MPa and -35 MPa for BS and SL composites samples, respectively, in agreement with Hseuh & Becher's model. The probe response function was fitted to the fluorescence data taking into account the iteraction of the laser beam within the sample and effects of light absorption, refraction and scattering by alumina particles and pores, and stresses gradients. The experimental fluorescence shift as a function of the distance from the indentations was compared with Yoffe's model and the PRF function. It was found that the experimental blister field strength is a factor of 10 smaller than that predicted by Yoffe's model, taking into account the densification of the glass underneath the indenter. Indentation residual stresses were also measured for SL glass using the modified Zeng and Rowcliffe's model. Stress profiles were measured around 50 N and 100 N Vickers indentations performed between -196 degrees C to 400 degrees C. The blister field strength increased with temperature and it could be explained by the variation of the E/H ratio with temperature. This work contributes for the understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the indentation residual stresses in glasses.

AB The borosilicate luminescent glasses doped with Dy3+ /Eu3+ and Ce3+ /Dy3+ /Eu3+ were prepared by high temperature melting synthesis method. The samples have white light emission under ultraviolet excitation. The emission spectrum and the CIE chromaticity coordinate analyses of the samples indicated that the emission intensity of Eu3+ at 612 nm increased first and then decreased with the increase of Eu2O3 content, and the luminescence intensity of the glass reached the maximum when the concentration of Eu2O3 was 0.15 mol%, and the color temperature was the lowest at this time. Ce3+ can not only sensitize the luminescence of Dy3+, but also promote the reduction of Eu3+ -> Eu2+ and increased the fluorescence emission of the samples in blue light. The luminescence properties and the color temperature of the glasses can be adjusted by changing the excitation wavelength and the doping ions concentration.

AB In this paper, using methyltrimethoxysilane (MTMS) as precursor, silica aerogels (SA) with excellent performance were synthesized within 10 h via APD without further surface modification and solvent exchange. The investigation was concentrated on three primary factors, including base catalyst, surfactant, and co-solvent system. The results indicated that NH3-H2O concentration and the volume ratio of NH3.H2O to MTMS were of great importance to the formation of particles, clusters, and pores. It was also obtained that the surfactant of CTAB influences the pore structure as well as thermostability of prepared aerogels significantly. Furthermore, an optimum volume ratio of EtOH/H2O in co-solvent system not only reduced the volume shrinkage but also enabled a good hydrophobicity of prepared SAs.
   Base on above, by adjusting the preparation parameters, the obtained SAs can exhibit the low density of 0.0968 g/cm(3), low thermal conductivity of 0.037 W m(-1) K-1, contact angle as high as 144.7(.) and thermostability reaching up to 528.1 degrees C. Meanwhile, some specific performance of SAs, such as hydrophobicity, could be tailored, which will improve its applicability.

AB In this study we determined the glass formation region in the TeO2 - ZnO - Bi2O3 - Nb2O5 system. The investigation covers TeO2 - based glasses containing ZnO (from 10 to 40 mol%), Bi2O3 (6-10 mol%) and Nb2O5 (6-10 mol%). The glasses obtained were transparent and yellow in colour. The thermal stability of the samples determined by DTA was found to be about 100 degrees C. Some physical characteristics (density, molar volume, oxygen molar volume and oxygen packing density) were estimated as well. The analysis of IR spectra showed that the network of glasses consists mainly of TeO4 (tbp) units, while Raman spectroscopy revealed the existence of TeO4 (tbp), TeO3+1 and TeO3 (tp) units. The UV-Vis spectroscopy established a red shifting of the cut-off depending on composition and the glass rich in TeO2 exhibited cut-off at about 388 nm while that with low TeO2 content was 378 nm.

AB Bioactive glasses (BGs) have been extensively investigated for use in medical applications due to their excellent biocompatibility and bioactivity. In this work, synthesized BG nanoparticles were deposited on titanium substrate by electrophoretic deposition (EPD) method. Suspensions of BG nanoparticles were prepared in different solvents (methanol, ethanol, isopropanol and butanol) using triethanolamine (TEA) as dispersing additive. Adsorption of TEA on BG particles increased with molecular size of alcohols; so the optimum concentration of TEA obtained at less amounts in larger molecular size alcohols: 0.4, 0.2 and 0.13Vol% for ethanol, isopropanol and butanol based suspensions, respectively. Suspension medium had the great effect on the microstructure of obtained coatings. Microstructures with mostly coarse, mixed (fine and coarse) and fine particles were obtained using ethanol, isopropanol and butanol based suspensions, respectively. Among the suspensions, the isopropanol based one with optimum TEA amount had the highest stability. Also the coatings obtained from isopropanol based suspension had the relatively high sinterability and roughness. So, the isopropanol based coating was chosen as the optimum one. The amorphous structure of optimum BG coating was survived even after sintering at 800 degrees C. The optimum coating showed good fibroblast cell adhesion and antibacterial activity against Escherchia coli and Staphylococcus aureus bacteria.

AB This work consists of studies on the influence of thermally resistant transition metal oxides (TMO) viz., Ta2O5, Nb2O5 and ZrO2 on orange emission and NIR emission (1.3 mu m) of Pr3+ ions in zinc borate glasses. Glasses of the composition 40ZnO-2Ta(2)O(5)/2Nb(2)O(5)/2ZrO(2)-56B(2)O(3): 2Pr(2)O(3) were synthesized by melt quenching technique. Optical absorption (OA), photoluminescence (PL) emission (in the wavelength region 500-2500 run at lambda(exc) = 443 nm) and decay profiles of the two of the prominent transitions viz., P-3(O) -> H-3(6) and (1)G(4) -> H-3(5) of Pr3+ ions were recorded. The spectra were analysed using standard J-O calculations and various radiative parameters associated with prominent transitions were estimated. Intensity of PL bands exhibited substantial increase due to addition of Ta2O5, Nb2O5 and ZrO2 to the host glass. Among the three studied glasses, ZrO2 mixed glasses exhibited the highest luminescence output. All the radiative parameters including quantum efficiency are observed to be the largest for ZrO2 mixed glasses. The results of IR spectral studies were also used for the analysis of emission spectra. The analysis indicated the degree of structural variations in the vicinity of luminescent Pr3+ ions is different due to addition of different transition metal oxides and such variations are found to be responsible for the changes in the PL output. Since a substantial improvement of PL emission corresponding to (1)G(4) -> H-3(5) transition is observed due to the admixing of TMOs, these glasses may be considered as the favourable candidates for the applications in telecommunications. Additionally, the emission in the green spectral region (which is predicted to be feeble under normal conditions) in the PL spectrum of Pr3+ ions is also found to be considerably increased and it is attributed to the transfer of energy from ZnO to Pr3+ ions in this region.

AB A new hydrogenated amorphous silicon carbide (a-SiCx:H) thin film with carbon nanostructure is grown through plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) method. The structural evolution and growth mechanism of the as deposited a-SiCx:H thin film are explored and further discussed with different substrate temperatures. The results show that the structure of the a-SiCx:H thin film is a multiphase structure of carbon nanostructures embedded into C-Si-O(-H) amorphous matrix, and the carbon nanostructure is a spheroidal graphite-like structure. With increasing substrate temperature, the carbon nanostructure gradually grows up through incorporation with surrounding nanostructures. When the substrate temperature increases further to 300 degrees C, the ultrafine basic structure units of graphite are found within the carbon nanostructure. In addition, the disorder of the thin film first increases and then decreases with increasing substrate temperature, which give rise to band tail states among the pi-pi* band gap. The change of structure of as synthesized a-SiCx:H thin film with different substrate temperatures supports the sub-plantation model. Furthermore, a tunable optical band gap depended on structure of the carbon nanostructures is demonstrated at different substrate temperatures, which may bring about a potential of application.

AB Controlling valence state of metal ions doped in glasses, in particular with lower valence, has been widely applied for turning the optical properties. Although hydrogen has been proven effective to reduce metal ions because of its strong reducing capability, the development of silicate glasses doped with lower valency metal ions is still a formidable challenge because of low diffusion rate of hydrogen gas in glass. Recently, the authors studied the reaction of metal ions doped in Na2O-Al2O3-SiO2 glass with hydrogen gas and succeeded in the preparation of the glass that exhibited fast hydrogen diffusion and reduced the metal ions to lower valance states. When the metal ions were doped in glasses containing Al2O3 with Al/Na > 1, the hydrogen gas diffusion coefficient was increased more than two orders of magnitude higher than that for glasses with Al/Na < 1 and the reduction of dopants concurrently caused the formation of Al-OH bonds in the glass. These completely different reductions, occurred depending on the Al/Na concentration ratio, were discussed to relate with the glass structure and the question whether and how the dopants were reduced in glass was elucidated. The obtained results will help to both understand basic science of hydrogen diffusion process in glass and develop new optical devices.

AB Borosilicate glasses containing 1 to 8 mol% ZrO2 were leached at pH 9, 7 and 1 until complete alteration. The Zr coordination in the bulk and at the gel surface is quantified using Zr L-2- XANES spectra in fluorescence and total electron yield mode, respectively. This provides evidence of a single layer at pH 9 whereas a second alteration layer develops at the gel surface at pH 7 and at pH 1. The surface layer, a witness of the first stages of glass alteration, exhibits larger structural variations than the bulk of the gel. This is related with the alteration conditions, from incipient alteration of pristine glasses to chemical diffusion controlled by the gels formed at a later stage. In all gels investigated, a majority of Zr occurs in (Zr-[6] sites. However, at neutral and acidic pH, the gels contain a high fraction of 7- and 8-coordinated Zr (Zr-[7] and Zr-[8], respectively) sites, and only 6-coordinated (Zr-[6]) sites at pH 9. The Zr local environment in the gels, determined by Zr K-edge EXAFS, is similar to that in the pristine glasses, with some additional contribution of Zr second neighbors. Both Zr-site geometry and medium-range structure of the alteration gel bring direct evidence that, under the experimental conditions used, glass dissolution is driven by an in situ hydrolysis/condensation mechanism. This allows the gel structure to mimic that of the pristine glass, including the [Zr-[6] site distortion or the linkage to the silicate gel framework. The pH has a greater influence on the structure of gels than does their Zr content. The structural evolution around Zr is mainly governed by the pH during alteration, while the Zr-[6] site symmetry is controlled by the Zr content of the gel. Certain gels contain more octahedral sites than expected from the concentration of charge compensating cations (Ca, Na), a situation similar to that observed in SiO2 ZrO2 xerogels.

AB Compositional and structural modification of the subanodic region of poled soda-lime glass under secondary heat treatment is studied using secondary ion mass spectrometry and micro-Raman techniques. A relaxation of the layered compositional distribution in the poled region of the glass remits to more equilibrium state in 250-780 degrees C temperature range, and the different relaxation mechanisms replace (and supplement) each other as the temperature rises. The main relaxation mechanism below the glass transition temperature, T-G, is alkalis hydrogen ions exchange, while at temperatures up to similar to 100 degrees C above T-G the main mechanism is the drift of alkali ions. At higher temperatures, up to 780 degrees C, the drift of calcium ions dominates. Heating the poled glass up to 780 degrees C results in partial crystallization of the subsurface layer of the poled glass with the formation of micron size grains, supposedly monoclinic dicalcium silicate, beta-Ca2SiO4.

The results show that the AFA and the magnetic properties of the alloy powders can be improved with proper metalloid admixture, among which the amorphous Fe72P7B7C7Si7 alloy powder with high saturation magnetization and low coercivity can be obtained. The amorphous Fe72P7B7C7Si7 alloy powder also exhibits good capability in degrading methylene blue dyes, and the optimal conditions for degradation processing are explored.

AB Various compositions (0.0 <= x <= 1.0) in the glassy system 55[(PbxBi1-x)TiO3]-44(2SiO(2).B2O3] doped with one mol percent of graphene nanoplatlets (GNPs) have been synthesized using the conventional melt-quenching technique. X-ray diffraction (XRD) study revealed the formation of bulk and transparent lead bismuth titanate borosilicate glasses. Density and molar volume were determined using the liquid displacement method. Structural analyses were carried out in detail using different characterization techniques such as infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, UV-vis spectroscopy and solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (SSNMR) spectroscopy. Si-29 and B-11-MAS-NMR-spectral analysis for five glass samples with different fraction of PbO reveal that as increases the content of PbO, the silicate and borate network become more polymerized.

AB Glasses of Ge25-xGaxTe75-yIy system with gallium content of 5-15 at% and iodine of 0-6 at.% have been prepared. The glass transition temperature, crystallization and melting temperature of the samples in the range 100-400 degrees C were determined by differential scanning calorimetry. In Ge15Ga10Te75-yIy system, the crystallization stability of glasses is extremely dependent on composition, taking the maximum value for y = 2; for Ge10Ga15Te75-yIy and Ge25-xGaxTe69I6 systems, a monotonous increase in the resistance to crystallization with an increase in the content of iodine and gallium is characteristic. The density of the glasses, measured by the hydrostatic weighing method, decreases with increasing of y. In view of physicochemical and optical properties among the investigated samples, the glasses of Ge15Ga10Te73I2 and Ge10Ga15Te69I6 are the most suitable for drawing optical fiber. Optical fibers are manufactured from these glasses by crucible method.

AB We present the results of a molecular dynamics study of homogeneous nucleation of liquid drops in a superheated Lennard-Jones (LJ) crystal at positive and negative pressures. The mean lifetime method has been used to determine the nucleation rate, calculate the Zeldovich nonequilibrium factor and the diffusion coefficient of nuclei, and determine the contribution of elastic stresses to the work of formation of a critical nucleus. The data obtained are compared with classical nucleation theory (CNT). A considerable discrepancy between data of MD simulation and CNT (up to 70 orders in the nucleation rate) has been established. With a satisfactory agreement between theory and simulation in the rate of the nucleus transition through the critical size, an essential discrepancy is observed in the work of formation of a critical nucleus. The neglect of elastic stresses in the nucleation work improves the agreement between the results of theory and simulation. The effect of the size dependence of the surface free energy of a critical nucleus on the work of its formation is estimated.

AB Germanosilicate glasses are essential in the manufacture of optical amplifiers, waveguides, and solid-state lasers. ZnO, with a wide direct band gap of 3.37 eV, has a broad range of applications in UV-shielding materials. To the best of our knowledge, no previous research adding ZnO into germanosilicate glasses has been reported. In this study, thirteen samples centered around a molar composition of 20K(2)O-20ZnO-40GeO(2)-20SiO(2) were melted, and the composition-property relationships were investigated. The densities are in the range of 3.18-3.46 g/cm(3) and the refractive index values (RI) are between 1.588 and 1.630, close to the RI of pure GeO2 (1.603). Density and RI values increase with GeO2 and SiO2 concentrations. The UV cut-off edge is between 313 and 320 nm, significantly higher than the 157 nm value in typical soda lime glass. Fragility (m) and glass transition temperature (T-g) were determined by fitting viscosity data with the MYEGA equation. The T-g from the MYEGA equation is in good agreement with T-g values from DSC. Thermal expansion coefficient of samples is in the range of 102.7 to 139.2 x 10(-7)/degrees C, mainly influenced by the amount of ZnO and K2O. We conclude that these samples have relatively high refractive index, high transparency, good glass forming ability, and good UV-shielding properties, making them suitable for lens applications.

AB The link between multicomponent diffusion and crystal growth has been investigated in a sodium borosilicate glass of interest to the nuclear industry. The growth rate of cristobalite, the principal crystal formed in this system, was studied between 700 degrees C and 900 degrees C. The growth rate was found to be linear with time and had an activation energy of 60 +/- 12 kJ.mol(-1) which is dose to the activation energy of sodium self-diffusion. Analysis of compositions around crystals and in the bulk of the glass revealed compositional gradients assigned to multicomponent diffusion. A diffusive mechanism involving exchange between silicon and boron appears to drive melt compositions near the crystals while in the bulk of the glass, another diffusive mechanism is predominant, consisting of exchange of silicon and sodium, justifying the value calculated for the activation energy of crystal growth. These results were then used for modeling growth rates in our glass.

AB The effect of mixing and sintering processes to prepare tin fluorophosphate glass (Pglass) matrix composites incorporating trisilanol phenyl polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (TSP-POSS) was investigated by comparing manual and suspension mixing, one-step and stepwise sintering processes to explore the structure dynamics and physical properties in the composites as a function of the different process conditions used. Energy Dispersive Xray analysis confirmed optimal homogeneous dispersion of the TSP-POSS molecules in the composites prepared by the suspension method. The observed increase of glass transition temperature and the reduction of non bridging bonds in the composites are believed to be the reason for the effective dispersion of TSP-POSS molecules in the composites. The chemical reaction between the TSP-POSS and Pglass was strongly influenced by the mixing/dispersion and sintering processes investigated. C-13 cross polarized magic angle spinning (CP MAS) solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy confirmed the chemical stability of the TSP-POSS during the sintering process at elevated temperatures. In addition, a chemical reaction between the TSP-POSS and Pglass was evidenced by Si-29 CP MAS NMR analysis. This study will provide a better fundamental understanding of the effective dispersion mechanism of the TSP-POSS molecules in the Pglass matrix that will facilitate tailoring the physicochemical properties of the composites with addition of various small concentrations of TSP-POSS for a number of applications where the pure Pglass is not applicable due to the intrinsic properties of the Pglass.

AB Tricalcium silicate (C3S) has excellent biocompatibility and osteoconductivity, however its use in implant scaffold manufacture is primarily achieved through hand kneading, making it difficult to accurately control the resulting size and shape. 3D printing is a rapid prototyping technology that can be used to accurately manufacture scaffolds with complex shapes. However, tricalcium silicate reacts rapidly with water, and the slurry solidifies quickly, making it impossible to use it to synthesize complex structures by 3D printing. In this study, a Tricalcium Silicate / Silica gel slurry suitable for 3D printing was prepared by combining silica gel (SG) particles and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) with Tricalcium Silicate (C3S). The effect of HPMC solution concentration on powder agglomeration was studied. The printability of the C3S/SG slurry was tested by measuring the printable time. The mechanical properties and in vitro degradation rate of C3S/SG and changes in composition during the degradation process, were evaluated. The C3S/SG slurry was used for printing complex scaffolds with high precision. The study of the C3S/SG slurry provides a new approach for the manufacture of tricalcium silicate implants, which can be applied as prosthetic materials in orthopedics, dentistry, and other areas of clinical medicine.

AB The molecules of the supercooled liquids in the cooperative molecular dynamics are partitioning to specific dynamic units, known as "beads". The beads have been defined as the smallest units, forming the heat capacity of the supercooled liquids. The beads appear as a sub-molecular scale in the dynamics of the glass-forming liquids. In the Adam-Gibbs theory the number of molecules, rearranging simultaneously, has been defined as the size of the cooperative rearranging region and these regions form the second larger molecular scale in molecular dynamics. Due to a noticeable discrepancy in estimating the number of beads in the molecules by the empirical rules as well as by theoretical models the relations between these two scales are not well known. Recently, a new thermodynamic method for estimating the number of the beads in the molecules and a rule for the examination of their temperature dependence have been suggested. By these methods 48 low-molecular supercooled liquids are investigated and the relations between these two molecular scales and the structure of the molecules have been found. The estimated number of configuration beads is compared with the number of the structural units (the chemical groups, the ions and the atoms), with the assigned number by the empirical rules and with the ones calculated, based on a Lennar-Jones model of the random first order transition theory. A constant and two kinds of temperature dependence of the number of the beads in the molecules of different liquids have been revealed. A molecular basis, forming the fragility of the supercooled liquids, has been found. From the results obtained, the investigated liquids are classified in several groups following the logical line in the formation of the beads.

AB The structural and microstructural properties of both homogeneous and phase separated lanthanum aluminosilicate (La2O3-Al2O3-SiO2 i.e. LaAS system) glasses were investigated. The microstructural observations and the structural characterization by X-ray Diffraction and by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance have highlighted the role of aluminum to favor a homogeneous vitreous aluminosilicate network by a high-level of Al/Si intermixing. A qualitative and simplified structure description is proposed from Si-29 nuclear magnetic resonance spectra assignment according to Q(n)(mAl) species by controlling the deviation of chemical parameters. According to this approach, a homogeneous distribution of non-bridging oxygen in the aluminosilicate network and Al-O-Al linkages are considered for homogeneous glasses with high Al/Si atomic ratio. Phase separated samples are characterized by a low Al/Si atomic ratio inducing spinodal or nucleation/growth phase separation according to the depolymerization level. Homogeneity degree of the samples is discussed according to the intermixing level between silicon tetrahedra and aluminum polyhedra as a function of the proportion of Q(n) and Q(n)(mAl) species.

AB Using melt quenching method, singly Er3+, Dy3+-doped and Er3+/Dy3+-codoped multicomponent borotellurite glasses in the composition (50-x-y) B2O3-10 TeO2-10 PbO-10 ZnO-10 Li2O-10 Na2O-(x) Er2O3- (y) 0.5 Dy2O3 ((x = 0.5, 1.0; y = 0); (x = 0; y = 0.5, 1.0); and (x = 0.5; y = 0.5, 1.0; x = 1.0; y = 0.5, 1.0)) (mol%) were synthesized. For the fabricated samples, optical absorption, photoluminescence excitation (PLE), photoluminescence (PL), near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence and decay lifetime measurements have been performed. For singly Er3+ and Dy3+-doped samples, Judd-Ofelt (J-O) parameters, Omega(t), were calculated following the absorption spectra and the derived Omega(t) parameters are utilized to predict respective radiative features for these glasses. The PL spectra of the Er3+ and Dy3+ singly doped glasses, excited at 378 nm (Er3+: I-4(15/2) -> (4)G(11/2)) and 350 nm (Dy3+ : H-6(15/2) -> M-4(15/2),P-6(7/2)), show important green and yellow emission bands at wavelengths 554 rim (Er3+ : S-4(3/2) -> I-4(15/2)) and at 574 nm (Dy3+ : F-4(9/2) -> H-6(13/2)), respectively. The PL decay curves for Er3+ : S-4(3/2) level and Dy3+: F-4(9/2) level follow single exponential, and non-exponential nature, respectively, for the singly Er3+ and Dy3+-doped samples. For singly 1.0 mol% Er3+ and 0.5 mol% Dy3+-doped samples, the evaluated stimulated emission cross-sections (sigma(E)(p)) for the transitions at lambda(em). = 0550 nm, and 574 nm are equal to 20.923 x 10(-20) cm(2) and 0.526 x 10(-20) cm(2), while the gain bandwidths are 3.975 x 10(-25) cm(3) and 0.789 x 10(-26) cm(3), respectively. For all the Er3+ containing glasses, a broad NIR emission band centered at 1.532 mu m (I-4(13/2) -> I-4(15/2)) is noticed under both 808 and 980 nm laser diode (LD) excitations, whereas the singly 1.0 mol% +-doped sample shows the highest NIR emission intensity with a full-width at half maximum (FWHM) equal to similar to 69 and 62 nm, respectively, at these pumping wavelengths. Moreover, the calculated highest (sigma(E)(p)) of 1532 nm NIR emission when pumped by 980 rim is 2.669 x 10(-20) cm(2) and gain per unit length is 1.06 x 10(-21) cm(2)s, for singly 1.0 mol% Er3+-doped glass. Additionally, for Er3+/Dy3+-codoped samples, with the decrement of Er3+ : NIR emissions, energy transfer (ET) from Er3+-> Dy3+ ions is identified upon both 808 and 980 nm LD pumping. For all Er3+/Dy3+-codoped glasses, the Er3+ : I-4(13/2) level decay time decreased with increasing Dy2O3 content and the NIR fluorescence decay curves exhibit single exponential nature.
   Under 980 nm excitation, the computed energy transfer efficiency (eta(ET)) from Er3+ : I-4(13/2) to Dy3+ : H-6(11/2) level is 22.9% for the 1.0 Er3+/0.5 Dy3+ (mol%)-codoped glass. Under 808 and 980 nm pumping, the mechanism of the ET processes between Er3+ and Dy3+ ions was discussed in detail. Further, for 1.0 mol% E3+ singly doped sample, a theoretical gain coefficient value of 17.01 dB/cm is obtained with an excited Er3+ ion fractional factor of 0.6. Following the explored visible and NIR optical results, the synthesized glasses might be useful for visible and NIR fiber lasers application.

AB Phase-change material such as Ge2Sb2Te5 is usually utilized to store data due to the pronounced contrast in optical and electrical properties between crystalline and amorphous phases. As the density differs in the two phases, it is necessary to explore the influence of pressure on the structures of Ge2Sb2Te5, especially for the supercooled liquid which is an inevitable state in the formation of the two phases. The short-range structures in supercooled liquid Ge2Sb2Te5 under compression have been investigated by using ab initio molecular dynamics simulation. The supercooled liquid eventually changes to a solid with an increase in pressure. During the process, tetrahedrons decrease slightly, revealing that tetrahedral structures are insensitive to the pressure. Octahedrons increase as the pressure is less than 3.7 GPa and then decrease, suggesting that a moderate pressure can promote the formation of octahedrons. The body-centered-cubic, face-centered-cubic and hexagonal closed-packed structures are observed at 9.9 GPa and then increase gradually. Additionally, it is noticed that Sb- and Te-centered clusters prefer Ge-centered clusters to forming the high-coordinated short-range structures during the compression process. Our research make us aware of the effects of pressure on short-range structures in supercooled liquid, which is of great importance in the application of phase change materials.

AB By formation beta-SiMON/Y-Si-Al-O-N glass-ceramic as interlayer, AlON ceramics (51.70 at.% O) were successfully joined at 1475 degrees C for 15 min. The effects of joining temperature on wettability of interlayer material on AlON ceramics, phase assemblages and microstructures of joints, and bending strength of the as-joined AlON ceramics were investigated. The wettability of the interlayer material on the AlON ceramics is positively correlated with joining temperature at 1300-1475 degrees C, and the minimum contact angle of 8 degrees was measured at 1475 degrees C. Increasing joining temperature is helpful to improve the bonding strength, and the maximum bending strength of 125 MPa was achieved for the samples joined at 1475 degrees C, which is similar to 41.7% of AlON strength. The high bonding strength should be mainly attributed to the formation of high strength beta-SiAlON crystalline in Y-Si-Al-O-N glasses and strong interface between AlON substrate and interlayer led by the excellent wettability of beta-SiAlON/Y-Si-Al-O-N glass-ceramic on AlON ceramics.

AB It is shown that elemental concentration profiles of poled multicomponent silicate glasses measured with Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) should be corrected to account for the concentration dependence of the rate of specimens etching by energetic ions used in SIMS. A procedure of transformation of both depth and concentration coordinate, which allows revealing real concentration profiles, is proposed. This approach can be applied to any specimen, in which the concentration of at least one element does not change with the distance from the specimen surface.

AB The structural, thermal, and luminescent properties of germanate glass containing heavily Dy2O3 content are systematically investigated by means of differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectra, absorption and emission spectra, and dynamic lifetime decay curves. To seek a suitable composition, the optimal glass forming region is first predicted through the thermodynamic calculation method and their basic physical properties are further forecasted according to the phase diagram model. The experiment results show that the density, refractive index, characteristic temperature, and phonon energy of the glass host all exhibit a close connection with the rare earth concentration. Strikingly, when the amount of Dy2O3 is up to 10.5 mol%, the transition temperature of the glass reaches 747 degrees C, which is higher than any other known germanate glass and is much advantageous to achieve a higher laser damage threshold. Moreover, the high doping caused the refractive index to increase significantly, which also prompted the glass to obtain a larger emission section and quality factor, increasing the possibility of laser output. Besides, three visible luminescence peaks of Dy3+ at 480 nm (blue) and 575 nm (yellow), and 665 nm (red) are observed even at an extremely high Dy3+ concentration. All the results demonstrate that this kind of germanate glass containing significant amounts of RE could be of interest for implementation of high-gain fiber lasers.

AB The red tilefish (Branchiostegus japonicas) is an important ingredient and fishery resource in South Korea. Branchiostegus japonicus-specific and tilefish primer sets were designed, and four PCR-based methods were developed to differentiate B. japonicas and B. albus species. The specificity of the conventional and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) developed was confirmed using twenty species, showing no cross-activity, and the limit of detection was 0.1-0.001 ng/mu L. Their accuracy was validated using a forensically informative nucleotide sequencing method on forty-seven red tilefish products. These two methods were further improved to develop direct triplex PCR and ultra-fast qPCR for the on-site food analysis, which could complete the entire analytical procedure within either 90 or 30 min, while maintaining the same accuracy. Therefore, these four PCR methods can be efficiently customized in various analytical areas and conditions, including field analysis, rapid screening, quality control, and labeling compliance, required by food manufacturing industry and regulatory authorities.

AB In this study, 10 fluorescein-labeled ractopamine (RAC) derivatives (tracers) were synthesized and characterized to develop a rapid fluorescence polarization immunoassay (FPIA) for the detection of RAC in pork, using previously produced RAC polyclonal antibodies. The effect of the tracer structure on the sensitivity of the FPIA was investigated. The specificity of the FPIA was evaluated with 70 beta-agonists and beta-blockers. The FPIA showed a limit of detection of 0.56 mu g kg(-1) for RAC in pork, with recoveries ranging from 74.8% to 86.6% in spiked samples. The total analysis time, including sample pretreatment, was less than 1 h. The FPIA was used to screen 150 commercial pork samples for RAC residues and the results were consistent with those of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). Our results demonstrate that the FPIA developed here is a rapid, accurate, and sensitive screening method for RAC residues in pork.

AB Asparagus (A. officinalis L.) is a highly nutrition vegetable crop. Here, three purple asparagus cultivars, namely, Jing Zi-2, Purple Passion and Pacific Purple, and one green cultivar, namely, Jing Lv-1 were studied. At least 16 kinds of anthocyanins were identified in purple and green cultivars, and peonidin, cyanidin and their glycoside derivatives were found to be the major anthocyanins. Transcriptome data showed that most anthocyanin biosynthetic genes and at least 5 kinds of transcription factors were significantly differentially expressed significantly between the green and purple cultivars. Dark-treated experiments revealed that anthocyanins are not produced in the absence of light, and both the anthocyanin biosynthetic and regulatory genes were down regulated greatly in the dark, implying that anthocyanins accumulation in asparagus is light-dependent. Overall, the results of this study provide useful information for understanding anthocyanin accumulation and the molecular mechanism of anthocyanin biosynthesis in asparagus.

AB A synergistic combination of analytical techniques was developed for the simultaneous determination of the three most biologically active chemical families in citrus juices: methoxylated flavones, coumarins, and furanocoumarins. No rapid methodology has been available to determine them together. A solid phase extraction concentrated these groups and a ternary reverse phase HPLC gradient completely resolved them from other juice components. Two coumarins, isomeranzin and osthole, were identified in a sweet orange (C. sinensis) cultivar, Changyecheng, for the first time. Pummelo juice was characterized by coumarin and furanocoumarin epoxides such as meranzin and epoxybergamottin. No epoxides were observed in the more acidic juices. Added furanocoumarin epoxides hydrolyzed rapidly in the most acidic juices. The ratios of the UV peak areas at 320 nm to the fluorescence emission peaks as well as the ratio of fluorescence emission peaks at 450-400 nm could be used to identify chromatographic peaks.

AB The Maillard reaction intermediate (MRI) and Maillard reaction products (MRPs) derived from xylose (Xyl) and phenylalanine (Phe) were prepared, then stored at 25 degrees C for 60 days. After storage, the contents of flavor compounds and the clarity of MRPs solution decreased, and the apparent Z-average hydrodynamic diameter (D-h) of particles in the solution increased from 149 to 439 nm. However, the MRI solution remained transparent during storage. The concentration of MRI only decreased by 6.49%, and A(294) of the solution increased slightly yet A(420) remained stable. Numerous flavor compounds in MRPs decreased during heat treatment, meanwhile the cross-linking and aggregation of MRPs were intensified, and the particles' D-h increased to micron level. The heated MRI solution showed a similar appealing profile and flavor fingerprints as the MRPs solution before heat treatment. Controlled formation of flavors from MRIs is proposed to be used as potential alternative to the existing Maillard flavorings.

AB Acrylamide a neurotoxin and strong carcinogen, is found in various thermally processed foods. In this study, an electrochemical sensor for detection of acrylamide using double stranded DNA (dsDNA)/Hemoglobin (Hb)-modified screen printed gold electrode (SPGE) was designed. The immobilization of ssDNA1-SH on the surface of SPGE was confirmed by cyclic voltammetry, and the interaction between ssDNA2-NH2 and Hb with the ratio 1:1 was characterized by agarose gel. The excellent response of the designed biosensor towards acrylamide due to acrylamide and Hb adducts and change of reduction/oxidation process of Hb-Fe(III)/Hb-Fe(II) was determined by square wave voltammetry (SWV). The biosensor showed the optimum response at pH 8.0. The linear working range for acrylamide was from 2.0 x 10(-6) to 5.0 x 10(-2) M with a detection limit of 1.58 x 10(-7) M. The biosensor was suitable for direct determination of acrylamide in water extracted of potato fries and displayed good reproductivity and high stability.

AB The lignin isolated from C. edulis ker residues showed a significant activating effect on alpha-amylase. Further studies revealed that the isolated lignin formed a 1:1 complex with alpha-amylase through hydrogen bonding and quenched fluorescence of alpha-amylase with a static quenching procedure. Binding with lignin led to conformational and granular size changes of alpha-amylase. Two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser spectroscopy (2D-NOESY) spectra suggested that -OH in G units and beta-O-4 structure were the major binding sites of lignin on the alpha-amylase molecule. Molecular docking studies indicated that the binding residue on alpha-amylase for lignin was not the same as for chloride ions, and the major binding force was hydrogen bonding. Furthermore, the docking results also showed the structural change of lignin induced by alpha-amylase. Thus, this work provided a new insight into the interaction between lignin from Canna edulis ker residues and alpha-amylase, which may be beneficial to apply lignin in the food industry.

AB Inhibition of alpha-glucosidase and non-enzymatic glycation is considered as an effective approach to treat type 2 diabetes. Herein, multispectroscopic techniques and molecular docking analysis were used to investigate the inhibition of galangin on alpha-glucosidase and non-enzymatic glycation. Galangin showed a reversible inhibition on a-glucosidase activity in a mixed-type manner through a monophasic kinetic process, and induced the fluorescence quenching and conformational changes of alpha-glucosidase by forming alpha-glucosidase-galgangin complex. Molecular docking revealed that galangin primarily interacted with the amino acid residues within the active site of alpha-glucosidase, which may prevent the entrance of substrate resulting in a decrease in catalytic efficiency of alpha-glucosidase. Moreover, galangin moderately inhibited the formation of intermediates of non-enzymatic glycation, fructosamine and alpha-dicarbonyl compounds and strongly inhibited the formation of advanced glycation end products.

AB Exposure of white wine to oxygen can cause detrimental effects, such as loss of sensorial characteristics. New antecedents, to the oxidation of wine, establish the importance of the formation of metallic complexes with compounds with adjacent hydroxyls. These complexes could reduce iron, promoting the formation of radicals through the Fenton reaction. The formation of hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-center dot) induced by air was found in all 18 white wines analysed by electronic paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The variation in the (OH)-O-center dot production was related to the phenolic composition of the wines. The amount of these radicals was linearly related to 5 phenolic compounds (caffeic acid, protocatechuic acid, p-coumaric acid, gentisic acid and syringic acid). Therefore, in this study, the relationship between certain phenolic compounds and the induction and amplification of the (OH)-O-center dot production was established and was postulated to be a chemical oxidation pathway to the Fenton reaction.

AB The ability of alpha-dicarbonyls, glyoxal (GO) and methyl-glyoxal (MGO) (2 M), to induce the formation of allysine in beta-lactoglubulin (LAC), and myofibrillar proteins (MP) (2 mg/mL) during incubation at 80 degrees C for 48 h, was studied. Both GO and MGO induced the formation of allysine in all tested proteins with GO being more reactive (23.8 and 8.6 nmoles/mg protein in LAC and MP respectively after 6 h) than MGO (2.6 and 3.1 nmoles/mg protein at the same sampling point). LAC seemed to be more susceptible to the glycation reactions than MP. The concentration of allysine decreased at 24 h along with a concomitant increase of advanced-glycation end-products suggesting that allysine may be involved in the formation of fluorescent adducts. The water-holding capacity and trypsin-chymotrypsin digestibility of the proteins decreased during the incubation assay. The mechanisms by which alpha-dicarbonyls-mediated carbonylation likely influenced the impairment of such protein properties are thoroughly discussed.

AB Herein, we concern the multi-scale structure and properties (digestibility and pasting) of highland barley starch following heat moisture treatment (HMT). With the moisture content (MC) rose, HMT reduced the molecular weight (molar mass) but increased the amylose content and the V-type polymorph. When the MC was lower than 25%, a higher MC resulted in increases in the long- (crystallites) and short-range orders (double helices, etc.); nonetheless, a further elevated MC (i.e., 30%) tended to reduce the amounts of these ordered structures. Also, the SAXS results reveal that the lamellar structure could be gradually vanished by the increased MC. These structural changes on multiple scales transformed part of rapidly digestible starch into the slowly digestible and/or resistant forms, accompanied by higher pasting temperature and lower paste viscosity. Hence, highland barley starch following HMT can serve as a food ingredient with reduced digestion rate and paste viscosity.

AB The phenolics were extracted and purified from brown rice and twenty-seven compounds were identified, including six phenolic acids, four phenolic acid glycosides, and eight flavonoid glycosides. Afterwards, the hydrothermal stability of phenolic extracts of brown rice was investigated after treatment at 60, 80, or 100 degrees C for 120 min. After hydrothermal treatment, ferulic acid, p-coumaric acid and free glucose were increased, while the phenolic glycosides were decreased. In addition, the total phenolic and total flavonoid content were decreased by 5.7%-9.2% and 3.5%-5.8% after initial 30 min, and then they were slightly recovered after treatment for 120 min. Consequently, there was a slight reduction (< 10%) in the total antioxidant activity of the phenolic extracts after hydrothermal treatment. These results suggest that hydrothermal treatment of phenolic extracts of brown rice made some phenolic glycosides deglycosylated, but does not lead to a large reduction in their overall antioxidant activity.

AB With increasing foodborne illness associated with fresh-cut produce, a chemical sanitizer to substitute chlorine is needed in the food industry. This study examined the washing effect of cinnamon leaf essential oil (CL-EO) emulsions on fresh-cut produce according to the ionic properties of surfactants. Washing effect of CL-EO emulsion (CLC) with cetylpyridinium chloride was the highest among all treatments on kale leaves. After CLC treatment, 1.83 and 1.54 log reductions against Listeria monocytogenes and Escherichia coli. O157:H7 were achieved, respectively, compared to washing with distilled water, and had about 0.6 log-reductions higher than NaOCl treatment. CL-EO droplets in CLC had a positive zeta-potential (+55 mV) compared to other emulsions. These results indicate that ionic properties of surfactants are very important in the washing effect of CL-EO emulsion. Additionally, CLC treatment did not affect the quality of kale leaves during storage. Therefore, CLC can be an effective chemical sanitizer for washing kale leaves.

AB The effect of different processing conditions (B: boiling; F: LAB fermentation; FS: fermentation and steaming; FSF: fermentation, steaming, flaking) of whole grain sorghum on the proximate composition, antioxidants, anti nutrients, and amino acids (AAs) was evaluated. A marginal increase in the protein content and a decrease in the fat content was observed in the F-sample. Total phenolics reduced by 28%; DPPH scavenging activity and CUPRAC activity increased by 1.4 and 6 times, respectively during fermentation. Tannin content reduced by 30-39%, for the F, FS and FSF samples; highest reduction in trypsin inhibitory activity (58%) was observed in the FS-sample. Total AAs increased by 2.9 folds in FSF samples. Grain sorghum contained mostly hydrophobic AAs (30-34%). The ratio of Essential amino acid to total amino acid and predicted protein efficiency ratio were highest in the F-sample, whereas predicted biological value of the FSF was 3 times than that of the control.

AB This study investigated the effects of dephosphorylation and sodium hexametaphosphate (SHMP) salt addition on the viscosity of milk protein concentrate (MPC) solutions. Dephosphorylation (DP) of casein was performed using bovine alkaline phosphatase. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra showed that dephosphorylation depleted the casein-bound phosphate region (CNP). SHMP addition (5 mM) had no impact on the P-31 NMR spectra of DP-MPC; addition of 5 mM SHMP to control MPC (C-MPC) resulted in a shift in peaks associated with the CNP region, possibly caused by SHMP sequestering calcium, leading to swelling of micelles. DP-MPC exhibited a lower viscosity compared to C-MPC, with SHMP addition at 12.5 and 25 mM causing gelation of C-MPC and DP-MPC solutions. This work confirmed the role that phosphate residues have in maintaining micelle structural stability and provides new insights into controlling viscosity of MPC solutions.

AB The hepatoprotective activity of ethanol extract of Ganoderma lucidum (GLE) in alcohol-induced liver injury in mice was investigated. HPLC coupled with photo-diode array detector and electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry was used to analyze the major triterpenoids in GLE. The effects of GLE on hepatoprotection were evaluated through histopathology and biochemical analysis of serum enzymes. We used isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) coupled with tandem mass spectrometry to identify differentially expressed liver proteome in mice. There were more than 4000 differentially expressed proteins; 40 proteins with the most significant changed proteins were applied for further bioinformatics analysis. Expression levels of cytochrome P450 2E1 and alcohol dehydrogenase 1, proteins that are closely associated with these processes, were validated by western blotting. Triterpenoids, major components of GLE, protected alcohol-induced liver injury through inhibiting lipid peroxidation, elevating activity of antioxidant enzymes, and suppressing apoptotic cell death and immune inflammatory response.

AB The interest in gluten-free (GF) products increases together with the increase in gluten-sensitive people. However, GF foods might have decreased nutritional quality as compared to the gluten containing counterparts. In this work, an investigation of the phenolic and antioxidant profile in 18 GF flours belonging to legumes, cereals and pseudocereals was achieved. Significant differences could be observed across samples. Total phenolic content was highest in violet rice flours, whereas total anthocyanins were highest in violet, nerone, and black rice flours. FRAP and ORAC antioxidant activities were correlated to phenolic contents and found to be higher in violet rice flours. Metabolomics highlighted a wide diversity in phenolics, with flavonoids (197 compounds ascribable to anthocyanins, flavones, flavanones, isoflavonoids, flavonols, and flavanols), phenolic acids (74 compounds belonging to hydroxycinnamics, hydroxybenzoics, and hydroxyphenylacetics), and tyrosol derivatives the most represented. Finally, OPLS-DA multivariate statistics outlined flavonoids, furofurans and phenolic acids as the most discriminant phenolics.

AB Sixteen hydrocolloids (12 carbohydrate-origin and 4 protein-origin hydrocolloids) at several concentrations were added to dough and their rheological, pasting and fermentation properties were studied. We found that 0.2-1% guar gum (GG) and locust bean gum (LBG) resulted in more strengthened doughs. But 0.2-1% pectin and konjac glucomannan (KGM) yielded weaker dough. The chemical interactions study suggested that pectin and KGM induced highest content of chemical bonds. In the fermentation studies, it was found that pectin, GG and agaric gum (AG) had positive effects, resulting in higher stability of dough pore space and gas retention. All protein hydrocolloids exhibited a negative effect on dough quality. Overall, polysaccharide based hydrocolloids with linear chain and higher viscosity have a remarkable effect on the enhancing gluten network. The interaction between hydrocolloids and gluten proteins was also crucial for dough properties, as exceptionally strong interactions caused disaggregation and instability of gluten network.

AB This study investigated the effects of Lactobacillus plantarum 120, Saccharomyces cerevisiae 2018 and Staphylococcus xylosus 135 inoculation on N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) and its precursors formation, and on microbiological characteristics of Chinese traditional fermented fish products (CTFPs). The results indicated that three strains could directly degrade NDMA in culture broth, and the highest degradation rate was observed in L. plantarum 120. The lactic acid bacteria counts in samples inoculated with L. plantarum 120 and mixed starter cultures were significantly (P < 0.05) higher than the others during the initial and middle fermentation stages (<= 3 weeks). The final contents of total volatile base nitrogen, trimethylamine, dimethylamine, nitrite and NDMA in inoculated samples were significantly (P < 0.05) lower than those in spontaneous fermentation samples. According to these results, the inoculation with autochthonous starter cultures was a promising method to inhibit the NDMA and its precursors accumulation in CTFPs during fermentation process.

AB Starch granules contain an internal channel structure that can be used to encapsulate and deliver active ingredients such as nutrients, drugs, chemicals and microorganisms. Nature creates a broad range of starch granule sizes and compositions in different plants and this range of encapsulation matrices provides a great deal of commercial opportunity. Starch granules can be utilised for encapsulation in their native form or treated with amylases/amyloglucosidase to facilitate the entry of active ingredients into the granules. Interactions within the granules can be relatively passive or more structured in the form of complexes (such as amylose-lipid complexes). This mini-review evaluates this application of starch and potential commercial product opportunities..

AB An anaerobic incubation for the enzymatic production of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in rice bran with the addition of glutamate, hydrolyzed wheat protein (HWP), yeast extract (YE) and pyridoxal-5-phosphate (PLP) was investigated. Rice bran was moistened (30% moisture content) with an electrolyzed oxidizing water and anaerobically incubated under nitrogen at 40 degrees C for 8 h. The incubation activated the glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) in rice bran and increased the GABA content from 10.7 to 171.5 mg/100 g. The addition of glutamate and protein hydrolysates further amplified the GABA content in the treated rice bran: 974.9, 487.4, and 372.8 mg/100 g, with 2.25% glutamate, 6% HWP, and 8% YE, respectively. Furthermore, addition of PLP (1.48 mg/100 g) as a coenzyme for GAD, together with 2.25% glutamate addition, could raise the GABA accumulation in rice bran to 2242 mg/100 g. Other amino acids in rice bran were changed in their composition by the anaerobic treatment.

AB In this study, functional, rheological and physicochemical characteristics were carried out for composite gluten free (CGF) flours, dough and biscuits, respectively fortified with fermented and unfermented Agaricus bisporus polysaccharide (FABP and UABP) flours. Addition of both FABP flour and UABP flour improved functional properties, while addition of FABP flour decreased viscosity property. Incorporation of both polysaccharide flours in CGF biscuit dough revealed a significant increase in rheological moduli (G' and G") and a decrease in tan (8). Supplementation of UABP flour increased thickness, whereas supplementation of FABP flour increased diameter and spread ratio. All CGF biscuit formulations exhibited lower fracture strength and hardness compared to the control. Furthermore, both UABP flour and FABP flour formulation (F-3) contained the highest nutrients in terms of protein, dietary fibers, amino acids and minerals among the CGF biscuit formulations. The sensory evaluation result showed that FABP flour formulation (F-1) and UABP flour F-1 were most acceptable.

AB The effects of (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) on the mechanical, antioxidative, antimicrobial, cross-linking and release properties of gelatin film were evaluated. The biofilm exhibited excellent antioxidant and antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. in the presence of EGCG at more than 3%. With the increasing content of EGCG (1%-5%), higher denaturation temperature (66.5-84.6 degrees C) and bloom strength (609.3-1114.7 g) and denser microstructure suggested the existence of cross-linking bonds in the biofilm. The infrared spectroscopy, protein pattern and release property of EGCG showed that hydrogen bonds were the main driving force for cross-linking of the biofilm. The release of EGCG from the biofilm system was described and two compounds were cross-linked via hydrogen bonds. Thus, this study confirmed the improvement on mechanical, bioactivities and release properties of the biofilm was most likely due to the interactions between gelatin and EGCG.

AB Volatile aroma of kiwifruit is a mixture of complicated and time-dependent compounds, and thereby the study of these compounds required distinguished analytical techniques as well as robust data analysis techniques. In this work, we report on the volatile fingerprints and biomarkers of three representative kiwifruit cultivars with commercial importance using headspace solid-phase microextraction gas chromatography-mass spectrometric (HS-SPME-GC-MS) coupled with multivariate analysis. As a result, 95 volatiles have been analyzed from the fingerprints, and ultimately six of which were identified as volatile biomarkers of the kiwifruit cultivars studied, which are formic acid octyl ester, 2-Methylbicyclo[4.3.0]non-1(6)-ene, 1-ethoxy-2,4-hexadiene, and 2-methyl-5(1-methylethyl)-bicyclo[3.1.0]hex-2-ene for Jintao (A. chinensis), and 1-methoxy-2-methyl-benzene and (E,E)-2,4-heptadienal for Cuiyu (A. deliciosa), respectively. Since the samples of each cultivar were in various maturities, these compounds could be taken as the maturity-independent volatile biomarkers for the kiwifruit cultivars, which would be valuable for marker-assisted flavour breeding in the kiwifruit production.

AB This study discusses polyphenolic compounds identified and quantified in Actinidia arguta fruits by LC-MS-PDAQ/TOF method and in vitro anticholinergic activity. Notably, of 31 compounds, including 16 flavonols, 7 flavanols, 7 phenolic acids, and 1 anthocyanin were identified or tentatively identified on the basis of their retention times, accurate mass measurements and subsequent mass fragmentation data, or by comparison with reference substances and literature. Among the detected compounds, 27 were reported for the first time in A. arguta fruits. The content of total polyphenols equal 845.54 mg/100 g dry weight (dw), and flavanols predominat (92% of total phenolic compounds). Flavonol derivatives, mainly glycosylated and acetylated forms of quercetin (22.64 mg/100 g dw) and kaempferol (18.40 mg/100 g dw) were quantified. The total content of phenolic acids was 29.63 mg/100 g dw, and neochlorogenic acid predominant. This anticholinergic activity effect of A. arguta fruits can be explained by the Pearson's correlation found between flavonols (r = 0.709 and 0.678), phenolic acids (r = 0.513 and 0.487), flavan-3-ols (r = 0.466 and 0.443) and anthocyanins (r = 0.312 and 0.301) for acetylcholinesterase (AChE) or butylcholinoesterase (BuChE), respectively. The data compiled from the quantitative polyphenol indicate that A. arguta fruits could be regarded as a promising source of bioactive functional food.

AB Red grape pomace, a wine-making by-product is rich in anthocyanins and has many applications in food and pharmaceutical industry. However, anthocyanins are unstable during processing and storage. This study aimed to investigate the stability of anthocyanins obtained by hydroalcoholic extraction (with and without sorbic acid) and colloidal gas aphrons (CGA) separation; a surfactant (TWEEN20) based separation. Anthocyanins in CGA samples showed higher stability (half-life = 55 d) than in the crude extract (half-life = 43 d) and their stability increased with the concentration of TWEEN20 in the CGA fraction (6.07-8.58 mM). The anthocyanins loss in the CGA sample (with the maximum content of surfactant, 8.58 mM) was 34.90%, comparable to that in the crude ethanolic extract with sorbic acid (EE-SA) (31.53%) and lower than in the crude extract (44%). Colour stabilisation was also observed which correlated well with the stability of individual anthocyanins in the EE and CGA samples. Malvidin-3-o-glucoside was the most stable anthocyanin over time.

AB A new bio-MSPE sorbent based on the use of C. micaceus and gamma-Fe2O3 magnetic nanoparticle was prepared for the preconcentrations of Co(II) and Hg(II). Critical parameters including pH, flow rate, quantity of C. micaceus, quantity of gamma-Fe2O3 magnetic nanoparticle, eluent (type, concentration and volume), sample volume, and foreign ions were examined. Surface structure and variations after interaction with Co(II) and Hg(II) of bio-MSPE sorbent were investigated by FT-IR, SEM, and EDX. The impact of bio-MSPE column reusage was also tested. The biosorption capacities were determined as 24.7 mg g(-1) and 26.2 mg g(-1), respectively for Co(II) and Hg(II). Certified reference materials were utilized to find out the accuracy of the prepared bio-MSPE method. This novel bio-MSPE method was accomplished by being applied to real food and water samples. In particular, it will be possible to make use of C. micaceus as new alternatives, in environmental biotechnology applications.

AB A biflavonoid, amentoflavone isolated from Nandina domestica and characterized by NMR spectral-data analyses was assessed for its antioxidant, and antibacterial potential in vitro and in food-model systems. Amentoflavone exhibited potent antioxidant ability (19.21-75.52%) on scavenging DPPH, ABTS, superoxide, and hydroxyl radicals. Fluorescent images confirmed bacterial membrane depolarization of both the tested pathogens Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli., with a significant reduction in cell viabilities at their respective MIC of 62.5 and 125 mu g/mL. Increasing rates of membrane permeability observed in 260 nm-absorbing material, potassium ion, extracellular ATP, and relative electrical conductivity assays confirmed antibacterial mechanistic role of amentoflavone as also evidenced by microscopic studies of SEM and TEM. There was a marked inhibitory effect of amentoflavone with a significant reduction in cell counts of S. aureus and E. coli. in minced chicken and apple juice at 4 degrees C, thus suggesting its nutritional enhancing efficacy as a natural antioxidant and antimicrobial agent

AB Our previous study reported that different tea processing methods along with the age of coffee leaves affected antioxidant and anti-inflammatory bioactivities; however, identification of phytochemical components or associated mixtures that contribute to the anti-/pro-inflammatory activities was not determined. Herein, we report results of additional experiments designed to characterize the phytochemical composition of fractionated coffee leaf extract, derived from Japanese-style-green-tea-process-young (JGTP-Y) and black-tea-process-mature (BTPM) leaves and related these data to anti-/pro-inflammatory activities. The aqueous fraction of BTP-M coffee leaves induced nitric oxide (NO), iNOS, COX-2, IL-6 and IL-10 production in Raw 264.7 cells. A 40% methanol fraction possessed greatest anti-inflammatory activities in IFN-gamma and LPS treated Raw 264.7 cells (P < 0.05). The anti-inflammatory activities of coffee leaf fractions could not only be attributed to chlorogenic acids, mangiferin, rutin, and caffeine content, but possibly subtle interactions of mixtures of bioactive molecules.

AB The novel Lactobacillus paracasei K5 strain, recently isolated from Greek cheese, was evaluated as potential sourdough bread starter. Breads were made using different amounts of L. paracasei sourdoughs as well as traditional sourdough for comparison. Quality characteristics of the breads (acidity and rising) were examined, as well as rope spoilage through macroscopic observations and molecular analysis (PCR-DGGE). The highest acidity levels (3.15 g lactic acid and 1.13 g acetic acid per kg of bread) and better resistance to rope spoilage were observed when bread contained 30% w/w L. paracasei K5 sourdough. Spoilage in the L. paracasei K5 breads was observed at 15-16 days, 5 days later than the control breads. In addition, L. paracasei K5 sourdough improved the bread sensory properties, as reflected by consumer preference and GC/MS analysis of aroma volatiles. Therefore, L. paracasei K5 can be successfully used for sourdough bread making with good quality and extended shelf-life.

AB The interactions of soy protein isolate with cyanidin-3-O-glucoside were investigated to study the protective effect of protein on anthocyanin's stability by UV-Vis spectrophotometry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy. Preheat treatment and binding of cyanidin-3-O-glucoside effectively changed the secondary structure of soy protein isolate, with a decrease in alpha-helix, random coli structure and an increase in beta-sheet and beta-turn. The soy protein isolate preheated at 121 degrees C exhibited a strong binding affinity towards cyanidin-3-O-glucoside with strong Ks of 147.40 x 10(4)M(-1) and also effectively increased the thermal and oxidation stabilities of black soybean seed coat extract via decreasing the degradation rate by 67% and 23%, respectively. Soy protein isolate interacted with cyanidin-3-O-glucoside mainly through hydrophobic interactions and static quenching process. Altogether, the results suggested that preheated soy protein isolate-cyanidin-3-0-glucoside interaction could effectively protect anthocyanins' stability through strong binding affinity influenced by the systematic alterations in the secondary structure.

AB The objective of this work was to evaluate the effects the solid-state fermentation parameters of defatted soybean flour (DSF) by Monascus purpureus or Aspergillus oryzae on the bioactive compounds. Central composite rotatable design, mull-response optimization, and Pearson's correlation were used. The fermentation parameters as initial pH (X-1), DSF-to-water ratio (X-2), and incubation temperature (X-3) were taken as independent variables. The function responses were isoflavone content, total phenolic content (TPC), and antioxidant activity. All fermentation parameters affected the isoflavone content when fermented by Monascus purpureus, whereas the TPC or antioxidant activities remained almost unchanged. For the fermentation by Aspergillus oryzae, all the function responses were influenced by X-2 and X-3 and were independent of the X-1. Estimated optimum conditions were found as x(1) = 6.0, x(2) = 1:1, and x(3) = 30 degrees C for both fungi. Achieving suitable fermentation parameters is essential to increase bioactive compounds in the DSF that makes it promising for food industrial applications.

AB The influence of liquid-state fermentation (LSF) by selected lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and Rhizopus oligosporus fungi on the content of rutin and total phenolic compounds (TPC), antioxidant capacity measured by ABTS test, FRAP assay and photochemiluminescence technique, and the inhibitory activity against formation of fluorescent advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) in vitro of raw and roasted buckwheat flours was studied.
   LSF caused a slight, specific LAB-dependent increase in TPC and a decrease in rutin content. Fermented raw buckwheat flours contained higher amounts of rutin and TPC with one exception when the highest increase in TPC was noted in roasted flour fermented by fungi. A LAB-dependent difference in the antioxidant capacity of buckwheat flours was noted while the inhibitory activity of fermented flours against AGEs formation was generally reduced. It can be concluded that LSF with selected LAB and fungi may improve the antioxidant and functional properties of buckwheat flours.

AB Aroma properties of spices are related to the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) present, which can provide distinct analytical signatures. The aim of the study was to examine similarity and diversity of VOC profiles of six common market spices (black/white pepper, chili paprika, cinnamon, nutmeg and saffron). The key volatiles were identified by PTR-TOFMS. Twelve samples per spice were subjected to PTR-Quadrupole MS (PTR-QMS) and Principal Component Analysis to compare the groups and examine diversity. With PTR-TOFMS, 101 volatile compounds were identified as total sum across all samples by mass and comparing them with literature data. Some spices comprised key character aroma compounds, e.g. cinnamaldehyde in cinnamon. For others, VOC groups, such as terpenes, acids and aldehydes topped the list. The PTR-QMS in combination with variables selection resulted in distinct PCA patterns for each spice. Variation within the spice groups was observed, but varied with the kind of spice. The results are valuable for future authentication studies.

AB The main goal of this research was to determine the relationship among chemical structure, bioactivity and temperature of chamomile during subcritical water extraction in isobaric conditions (45 bar) at seven different temperatures (65-210 degrees C). The influence of temperature on phenolic profiles was defined by UHPLC-HESI-MS/MS. The overall results indicate that the presence of conjugated double bonds, side chains, glucose moiety or ether moiety in molecules influence the efficiency of polyphenols' extraction in subcritical water. In terms of antioxidant activity, the extracts were the most active towards ABTS radicals (IC50 = 7.3-16.8 mu g/mL), whereby temperature of 150 degrees C was optimal. On the other hand, the extracts obtained at 115 degrees C showed highest cytotoxicity. Inhibition of alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase was the highest at 65 and 85 degrees C, i.e. 0.51 and 4.13 mmolAE/g, respectively. Activity against tyrosinase was the highest at 210 degrees C (17.92 mgKAE/g). The data showed that different non-phenolic compounds may also participate in bio-activities of the extracts.

AB Dictyophora echinovolvata is a kind of edible mushroom in the Dictyophora genus, of which polysaccharide is an important chemical substance. Herein, three polysaccharide fractions (DEP-4P, DEP-6P and DEP-8P) were prepared from water extract of D. echinovolvata using gradient ethanol precipitation method. Their chemical structures were analyzed by methylation analysis and 1D/2D NMR spectroscopy. Molecular weights were determined by multi-angle laser light scattering combined with size-exclusion chromatography (HPSEC-MALLS). HPSEC data showed that DEP-4P had the highest values of molecular weight, intrinsic viscosity and hydrodynamic radius. DEP-6P and DEP-8P had lower molecular weights, which contributed to their easily distinguished 1D and 2D NMR spectra. Methylation and NMR analysis suggested that the three fractions were linear alpha-(1 -> 4)-glucans with alpha-Glcp residues linked to the backbone at C-6.

AB This study investigated the effect of UV-B irradiation and the combinational effect with glucosamine caramel, fructosazine and riboflavin on the antimicrobial activities against Bacillus subtilis (ATCC 6633) and two strains of Escherichia coli (AW 1.7 and ATCC 25922). The quantum yield of fructosazine was two times less than that of tryptophan, indicating its ability to emit fluorescent light but less efficiently than tryptophan. UV-B treatment alone was efficient to achieve a bactericidal effect for both E. coli stains tested, however no effect was found for Bacillus subtilis for up to 80 mJ/cm(2) UV-B. The combination of UV-B with photosensitizers fructosazine, gluco-samine caramel and riboflavin enhanced the UV-B efficacy against E. coli strains at lower UV-B doses, while Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633 was more resistant to the treatment combinations. High-performance liquid chromatography showed the production of different fructosazine reaction products occurred during irradiation, including the possible formation of endoperoxides.

AB The current review was aimed to summarize the nutritional values and various health benefits of fermented soy products. Several previous researches proved that soy products rich in protein can reduce the serum concentrations of total cholesterol, low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), and triglycerides if consumed instead of animal protein. Apart from these lipid-lowering effects, fermented soy products also proved to be effective in attenuating the effects of diabetes mellitus, blood pressure, cardiac disorders and cancer-related issues. The nutritional value of the fermented soy products gains much attention due to its increased levels compared to the non fermented ones. The origin, compositions, nutritional values of different fermented soy products and health promoting benefits of fermented soy products were systematically reviewed. Hence the in-depth analysis of the various research findings on fermented soy products, beneficial activities may help the future researchers to derive a conclusion on its beneficial effects on health.

AB The production of mono- and diacylglycerols rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids is achieved in this study, by solvent-free glycerolysis of anchovy oil with lipase PS-DI from Burkholderia cepacia. Attention is focused on the oxidative stability of the reaction products, determined in terms of induction time (I-t). The effects of glycerol/triacylglycerol molar ratio, enzyme concentration, and reaction temperature on mono- and diacylglycerol production and I-t are all assessed. The operating conditions that optimized monoacylglycerol yields and oxidative stability were a glycerol/triacylglycerol ratio of 3/1, 9.0% (w/w) Lipase PS-DI, a stirring rate of 200 rpm, and a reaction time of 4 h, at 45.8 degrees C, producing a content of 24.8% and 51.9% of mono- and diacylglycerols, respectively, over an I-t of 1.41 h. The glycerolysis conditions determined by simultaneous optimization strategy increased the oxidative stability of the glycerolysis products by 68%, which rose from 0.84h (individual optimization) to 1.41 h.

AB This paper investigates the phenolic composition of 17 monocultivar commercial cold-pressed grape seed oils. Chromatographic profiles showed the presence of more than 28 molecules, 11 of which were successfully identified by HPLC-DAD-MS-TOF and HPLC-FLD analysis. Pinoresinol, ethyl caffeate and ethyl gallate were detected for the first time in these oils. The total phenolic content ranged between 0.83 mg/kg for Viognier sample to 15.16 mg/kg for Merlot org sample. The detected ethyl esters can be suggested as markers to evaluate the intensity of fermentation in grape seeds before oil extraction, and to control the sensorial quality of the produced oils. In addition, the inhibitory power of these phenolic extracts against Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase 1B enzyme (PTP-1B), overexpressed in type-two diabetes, was investigated for the first time. Data highlighted a good correlation between total phenolic content and inhibitory power, with pinoresinol, p-coumaric acid and quercetin making the greater contributions.

AB The potential phytochemical losses occurring throughout the sequential steps of in-vitro gastrointestinal digestion and colonic fermentation of a rosemary aqueous extract were investigated. Crude (CE), digested (DE) and fermented (FE) extracts were characterized in terms of their phenolic profile and biological activities. Rosmarinic acid was the phytochemical that underwent the most significate transformation during digestion and fermentation, which amounted to 60% compared to the 26% degradation of the total phenolics. Overall, the simulated digestion step decreased the antioxidant activity estimated by DPPH, ABTS, FRAP, ORAC and TBARS assays. Both CE and DE did not present antiproliferative potential, however, FE exhibited a pronounced cytotoxic activity (GI(50) = 116 mu g/mL) against HeLa cells. CE and DE showed to be moderate inhibitors of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), S. aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, whilst the FE acted as a moderate inhibitor of MRSA and MSSA.

AB New food commodities, particularly pasta, bread and cookies, made with mixed flours containing ancient wheat species and other cereals, have become popular in recent years. This calls for analytical methods able to determine authenticity of these products. Most DNA-based methods for the authentication of foodstuff rely on qPCR assays specifically targeting each plant species, not allowing the identification of unsearched ingredients. Moreover, the discrimination among closely related plant species, particularly congeneric ones like Triticum spp, remains a challenging task. DNA fingerprinting through tubulin-based polymorphism (TBP) and a new assay, TBP light, have been optimized for the authentication of different wheat and farro species and other cereals and tested on a set of commercial food products. The assay has a sensitivity of 0.5-1% w/w in binary mixtures of durum wheat in einkorn or emmer flour and was able to authenticate the composition of test food sample and to detect possible adulterations.

AB As major food staple, rice (Oryza sativa L.) is cultivated in irrigated fields absorbing widely trace elements wich may or may not migrate during processing types. Thus, we aimed to evaluate five national rice brands found in local market, in order to verify concentration of elements As, Ba, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Ni, Pb, Sb, Se, Sn, Sr, V, Tl and Zn, presenting the differences and migration patterns between brown, parboiled and polished rice for each brand. Data were evaluated using ANOVA, post-hoc Tukey and PCA. The two major components presented 94.33% variance, indicating strong differentiation in samples by their processing types from their mineral composition. K is widely distributed over the grain, Mg, Fe and Ba are more distributed in the outer layers being more susceptible to loss, and Ca, Sr and Zn are more sensitive to the parboiling hydrothermal process.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the phenolic profile of grape and kiwi juice pomace by HPLC-ESI-MS, and their correlation with antioxidant properties determined with DPPH, FRAP and OH center dot scavenging assays. A total of 32 compounds have been identified including anthocyanins, flavonols, flavan-3-ols and phenolic acids. Significantly higher relative amounts of anthocyanin monoglucosides, flavan-3-ols (catechin, epicatechin, and procyanidin), and flavonols (quercetin and its derivatives) were found for grape pomace. Whereas kiwi pomace contained higher amounts of quinic acid, caffeic acid and its derivatives. Although grape pomace had higher total phenolic content (TPC), it showed lower OH center dot scavenging capacity than kiwi pomace, but better DPPH center dot scavenging activity and reducing power. This indicated that the antioxidant activities do not only rely on the TPC but also associate with their phenolic profiles. Overall the two pomaces could potentially be exploited as an inexpensive source of natural antioxidants for food production.

AB Enzymatic synthesis of fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) from chia (Salvia hispanica L.) oil has been performed with different modified derivatives and compared with commercial immobilized lipases to produce omega-3 rich FAEE. Therefore, the main objective was to synthesize omega-3 esters from chia oil catalysed by polyethylene glycol-modified lipases using a biocatalyst with higher stability than commercial derivatives. Lipase from Thermomyces lanuginosus (TLL) was immobilized by hydrophobic adsorption on Sepabeads C-18 followed by a physicochemical coating of lipase surface with a dense layer of PEG. Ethanolysis reactions were carried out using pressurized liquid extracted chia seed oil and with different lipase derivatives to compare the omega-3 FAEE yield and ratio of reaction products, which were analysed by HPLC-ELSD. Furthermore, reutilization of lipase derivatives was studied to evaluate the stability after several reaction cycles to minimize decreasing of catalytic activity and develop a feasible enzymatic process for food industrial applications.

AB Haptens are small molecules with low molecular weight that include biotin and many toxins in food. In this study, we used biotin as a model molecule for hapten detection. In this competitive immunoassay anti-biotin antibody-modified magnetic beads (Ab-MBs) and biotinylated thiol-DNA gold nanoparticles (biotin-GNPs) were used. The assay contains three reactions, the mixing of the sample and Ab-MBs, the capture of biotin-GNPs by Ab-MBs and the magnetic attraction. When biotin molecules were absent, the solution was transparent because biotin-GNPs bound to Ab-MBs which were caught by an external magnetic field. When biotin was present, the supernatant was red because the Ab-MBs bound to the analytes and the gold nanoparticles were still in solution. It was possible to complete all the operating steps in 15 min. The limit of detection (LOD) was 2 pmol. This rapid competitive-immunoassay has potential for application in detection of other haptens.

AB Erythorbyl laurate is a potential food additive as a multi-functional emulsifier having antioxidant and antimicrobial activities. In this study, a gas-solid-liquid multiphase system (GSL-MPS) was established to enhance the production yield of erythorbyl laurate in a lipase-catalyzed solvent-free synthesis. The significant reaction variables were optimized as follows: substrate molar ratio of 2:1 (lauric acid:erythorbic acid) and enzyme concentration of 120 mg/mL (840 PLU/mL). Under these conditions, the maximum production yield in GSL-MPS was 13.974 mg/mL, which is 8.60- and 4.26-fold higher than the yields obtained in an organic solvent mono phase system (OS-MPS) and a solid-liquid biphase system (SL-BPS), respectively. Moreover, the operational stability of the immobilized lipase was significantly improved in GSL-MPS compared with OS-MPS. These results indicate that GSL-MPS can be an enzymatic reaction system facilitating efficient production of ester compounds as a means of increasing production yields and the reusability of the immobilized lipase.

AB For identifying discriminatory biomarkers between green tea (GT) and decaffeinated green tea (dGT), in-tube extraction (ITEX)-gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) was optimized to determine volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from tea products. Biomarker selection between GT and dGT was then conducted by random forest (RF). Optimized ITEX parameters by central composite design were an incubation temperature of 92 degrees C, incubation time of 12 mins, and 36 for syringe strokes. A training group of 24 samples and testing group of 21 samples were used to RF classification of biomarkers identification. Results revealed that 2-hexenal, 2-ethyl furan, indole, and beta-ocimene were selected as discriminatory biomarkers between GT and dGT in the training group. Using these biomarkers with RF classification algorithms, prediction accuracy for dGT and GT were 88.9% and 100%, respectively, which was higher than for other classification algorithms. This implies that ITEX-GC-MS can be a promising tool for quality control of commercial tea products.

DE Apple, avocado, tomato; Fresh cut; Fruit; 1-Methylcyclopropene
ID 1-MCP
AB Fresh-cut (FC) apple, avocado and tomato fruits were examined to determine if sorption dynamics previously reported for FC apple were of general occurrence for other fruits. Fresh-cut apple consumed headspace 1-MCP at high rates, fully depleting 1-MCP in 1.5 h. FC apple pretreated with ascorbate showed 80% reduction in sorption rate. Fresh-cut avocado showed moderate sorption, depleting 95% of system 1-MCP over 6 h. FC avocado was unaffected by ascorbate. FC tomato showed negligible sorption of 1-MCP. Sorption by FC apple and avocado was differentially affected by heat. High-temperature pretreatment of FC apple and avocado resulted in 80% and 20% reductions in 1-MCP sorption rates, respectively. The data indicate that 1-MCP sorption differs significantly between FC tissues of different fruits, likely reflecting differences in thermo-tolerant, physical-sorption processes versus oxidative metabolism. Possible drawbacks in the use of 1-MCP as a post-processing treatment for FC fruits are discussed.

AB The quantitative effect of different preparation variables on the sodium content of cooked dry pasta was evaluated. Semolina spaghetti (< 5 mg sodium/100 g) was cooked by a typical method (454 g, 5.68 L water, 36 g salt, al dente, no rinsing) and after systematic variation of amount of salt, water:pasta ratio, cooking volume and time, rinsing, pasta shape, whole grain. Sodium was assayed by ICP-MS, including rigorous quality control. Pasta cooked without salt had < 5 mg sodium/140 g serving, and 247-490 mg/serving when cooked in salted water by the different variations. Rinsing reduced sodium by 34%. There was a linear relationship between salt concentration in cooking water and sodium in cooked pasta; doubling the concentration increased sodium by 243 mg/serving (> 100% of 2300 mg/day), relative to the reference method. No other variables affected sodium. Results allow more accurate estimation of sodium intake from cooked pasta, since food composition tables that do not reflect variations in cooking parameters.

AB The capabilities of dynamic headspace entrainment followed by thermal desorption in combination with gas chromatography (GC) coupled to single quadrupole mass spectrometry (MS) have been tested for the determination of volatile components of olive oil. This technique has shown a great potential for olive oil quality classification by using an untargeted approach. The data processing strategy consisted of three different steps: component detection from GC-MS data using novel data treatment software PARADISe, a multivariate analysis using EZ-Info, and the creation of the statistical models. The great number of compounds determined enabled not only the development of a quality classification method as a complementary tool to the official established method "PANEL TEST" but also a correlation between these compounds and different types of defect. Classification method was finally validated using blind samples. An accuracy of 85% in oil classification was obtained, with 100% of extra virgin samples correctly classified.

AB Purple sweet potato, a source of acylated cyanidin and peonidin derivatives, is commercially available as a food colorant. Our objectives were to determine molar absorptivities (epsilon), spectral and colorimetric properties of purple sweet potato anthocyanins. Anthocyanins were isolated by semi-preparative HPLC, weighed, dried, and redissolved in acidic methanol or water. Anthocyanins were diluted in pH 1-9; epsilon, spectra, and color were measured on the methanolic and aqueous solutions. Higher epsilon were obtained in 0.1% HCl methanol (10,797-31,257 L/(mol x cm)) than in aqueous solution pH 1 (8861-24,303 L/(mol x cm)). Peonidin 3 so phoroside-5-glucoside had greatest epsilon in pH 1, but in alkaline pH, epsilon of acylated Peonidin-3-sophoroside-5-glucoside derivatives were greatest. Generally monoacylation decreased epsilon while diacylation increased epsilon. Location of acylation also affected epsilon of two Peonidin isomers (pH 1: 15,999 and 21,011 L/(mol x cm)). All anthocyanins expressed red-pink hues (330 degrees-13.2 degrees) in acidic pH and blues (230 degrees-262 degrees) in alkaline pH.

AB Ara h2 is a major peanut allergen that induces rashes, vomiting, diarrhea, and anaphylactic shock. Since peanut is a major source in producing edible oils globally, Ara h2 residues can be present in various edible oils. In this work, an immunomagnetic nanoparticle-based lateral flow assay for identifying Ara h2 in edible oils is developed. This assay exhibits high sensitivity with a visual detection limit of 0.1 mg/kg Ara h2 in oil, and favorable specificity in differentiating peanut from seeds and nuts. The calculated CV values of intra- and inter-assay were 6.73-10.21% and 4.75-8.57%, respectively, indicating high reproducibility. In an analysis of 26 oil products, Ara h2 was detected in two peanut oils as 0.122 +/- 0.026 mg/kg and 0.247 +/- 0.027 mg/kg. The entire method takes 5 h, including a 3.5-h sample preparation. Hence, this method has the potential to be an effective way to screen edible oils for Ara h2.

AB Strawberry crop is very sensitive to osmotic stress conditions. We investigated the effect of the stress induced by mild drought (DS) and salt (SS) stresses, on molecular, physiological, and metabolic processes in the strawberry crop (Fragaria ananassa), cv. Camarosa. The results showed that the fruit yield was not affected. Mild DS and SS also resulted in an increased content of phenolics, anthocyanins, and L-ascorbic acid, and an increased antioxidant activity. These effects were accompanied by increased levels of ABA and its derivatives (phaseic and dehydrophasic acids), alongside the upregulation of several genes involved on their synthesis. Therefore, the results obtained in this study suggest that mild DS and SS improve the functional quality of strawberry fruits through and ABA-dependent mechanism.

AB Transglutaminase (TGase) catalyzing crosslinking between intra- and inter-chain glutamine and lysine peptide residues has been used for modifying protein's structure. However, its enzymatic performance on albuminoids such as collagen was still not completely illustrated. Herein, we investigated the crosslinking efficiency of films preheated at different temperatures and estimated its physicochemical properties. The electrophoresis results showed that the extracted collagen had typical triple helix structure but reduced and even disappeared as temperature increased. Accordingly, X-ray diffraction (XRD) indicated that the amount of triple helices decreased, corresponding to the decreases in thermal stability and mechanical properties of films. TGase cross linking decreased the thickness of all films, while mechanical properties and thermal stability had a significant improvement especially at 45 degrees C and 65 degrees C. With the proper equilibrium of denature temperature and TGase crosslinking, the tailored film-forming properties of collagen can offer a potential to engineer collagenic material for biodegradable and edible packaging applications.

AB This study aims to monitor composition changes in an anthocyanin-rich beverage during storage by the means of UV-VIS measurements associated with a multi-curve resolution procedure. Hibiscus sabdariffa extract was stored at 37 degrees C for 50 days and UV-VIS spectra were measured on the extract and the fractions of the extract every 5 days. MCR was carried out in two steps, first with the fraction and then the extract spectra. The results enabled the main polyphenols initially present to be identified, anthocyanins and chlorogenic acid, but also found the nature of the main degradation products: the polymers from anthocyanin condensation and scission products. In addition, comparison with HPLC analysis results showed that the MCR procedure recovered the correct shapes of the concentration profiles particularly of anthocyanin and polymer kinetics during storage. This work gives perspective for the use of a rapid and efficient technique to monitor pigment-rich beverage processing or storage.

AB The effects of salting and subsequent freezing on the physicochemical and histological properties of frozen thawed tuna meat were investigated. Salting facilitated the microstructural recovery as indicated by the decrease or disappearance of intracellular holes. The yield of the 0.5 M and 1 M salted samples increased by 20% which was evaluated by the mass ratio of products to raw material. Morphological transformation from ice columns to spherical or ellipsoidal ice crystals was tentatively attributed to the extraction/solubilization of myofibrillar proteins, contributing to increased water-holding capacity. However, increased thawing loss and centrifuging loss after thawing were observed in the 2 M and 3 M salted samples with large ice crystals and enlarged extracellular spaces. These modifications were closely associated with the changes in protein properties. In conclusion, enhanced water-holding capacity, high yield, and good freezing stability can be achieved by optimal salting.

AB Fining, which involves the addition of adsorptive material in order to reduce or eliminate certain unwanted components, is a common winemaking practice. Fining agents affect the wine phenolic compounds, some of which may be reduced. When this reduction is experimented by the tannins, a positive effect may result by decreasing astringency in the wine, although a decrease in the wine color may also take place when the anthocyanins are involved, affecting its quality. Recently, grape cell wall material has been tested as a potential fining agent in wines, since it shows a high affinity for tannins so that its use could reduce wine astringency. In this work, the use of purified grape pomace as fining agent is proposed and the effect of different doses and contact times on wine chromatic characteristics was investigated as well as how differences in the composition of the purified pomace could alter the phenolic composition of a red wine. The results showed that a Monastrell purified grape pomace dose of 6 mg/ml and a contact time of 5 days could be suitable for decreasing the wine tannin content without producing great changes in the wine chromatic characteristics. When comparing the effect of purified pomaces from four grape varieties, some differences in their capacity to interact with the wine tannins and anthocyanins were found, however, the results confirm that the purified grape pomace, a byproduct of the enology industry could be a new interesting fining material.

AB Contamination of foods by aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is a common serious problem. To improve the efficiency of AFB1 detection, this study aims to develop a sensitive aptasensor for detection of AFB1 in food samples based on the catalytic effect of aptamer/G-quadruplex DNAzyme probe. The resulting reassembly of this probe in the presence of hemin and K+ catalyzes the generation of fluorescent 2,3-diaminophenazine (DAP) from o-phenylenediamine (OPD). Interestingly, we first found that the high background induced by the superfluous hemin can be effectively suppressed with the aid of sequential adsorption and magnetic separation by magnetic oxidized multiwall carbon nanotubes (Fe3O4@oMWCNTs). This aptasensor exhibits a high sensitivity toward AFB1 with a detection limit of 0.02 ng/mL. The assay also shows higher selectivity for AFB1 compared to other reported agents and can be employed to detect AFB1 in foodstuffs, which might find broad practical applications in other food contaminants determination.

AB In this study, three drying methods, namely, hot-air drying, freeze drying (FD), and infrared radiation drying (ID), were applied to dry bitter gourd (Momordica charantia L.) slices. Results showed that the drying methods had significant influences on appearance, color, rehydration ratio, and microstructure of dried bitter gourd. FD provided high-quality dried bitter gourd products due to the uniform honeycomb network and less collapsed structure. Three water-soluble bitter gourd polysaccharides (BPS-H, BPS-F, and BPS-I) were obtained from the bitter gourd dried using the three drying methods. The three polysaccharides exhibited similar preliminary structural characteristics with different monosaccharide compositions and molecular weights. BPS-I obtained from ID-dried bitter gourd had higher sugar and uronic acid contents than BPS-H and BPS-F. BPS-I exhibited stronger antioxidant activities and bile acid-binding capacity in vitro than BPS-H and BPS-F. Moreover, BPS-F and BPS-I showed significant alpha-amylase inhibitory activities in vitro.

AB Shellfish are one of the most common causes of food allergy. Arginine kinase (AK) is known as an important allergen in shellfish. In the present study, AK from crab (Scylla paramamosain) was purified and its crystal structure was determined. A comparison of AK from S. paramamosain to AKs of other species showed high amino acid sequence and secondary structure identity, while the superposition of crystal structures of AKs from different species revealed only slight differences. Similarly of the linear epitope regions among species was observed in the epitope alignment of AKs; conformational epitopes were located in the regions where secondary structure was conserved. The structure of S. paramamosain AK is an accurate template for the analysis of the IgE binding pattern, and the structure conservation and epitope similarly of AKs among species could help to inform our understanding of the cross-reactivity and contribute to the prediction of cross-reactivity related epitopes.

AB This study was conducted to identify and characterize antioxidant peptides from the alcalase hydrolysate of the blue-spotted stingray. Purification steps guided by ABTS cation radical (ABTS') scavenging assay and de novo peptide sequencing produced two peptides, WAFAPA (661.3224 Da) and MYPGLA (650.3098 Da). WAFAPA (ECa50 = 12.6 mu M) had stronger antioxidant activity than glutathione (EC50 = 13.7 mu M) and MYPGLA (EC50 = 19.8 mu M). Synergism between WAFAPA and MYPGLA was detected. WAFAPA and MYPGLA surpassed carnosine in their ability to suppress H2O2-induced lipid oxidation. The peptides protected plasmid DNA and proteins from Fenton's reagent-induced oxidative damage. Thermal (25-100 degrees C) and pH 3-11 treatments did not alter antioxidant activity of the peptides. MYPGLA maintained its antioxidant activity after simulated gastrointestinal digestion, whereas WAFAPA showed a partial loss. The two peptides may have potential applications as functional food ingredients or nutraceuticals, whether used singly or in combination.

AB Pyropia yezoensis is an important marine crop in the world. We cultured it under two levels of partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) (408 (LC), 998 (HC) mu atm) and nitrate (30 (LN) and 500 (HN) mu mol L-1) to investigate the effect of ocean acidification on its growth and food quality under changing nitrogen supply. HC decreased growth rate of P. yezoensis under LN but did not affect it under HN. Phycoerythrin and phycocyanin were enhanced by HC, particularly at HN, which contributed to the darker color. HC stimulated the synthesis of sweat amino acids regardless of nitrate condition and umami amino acid only under LN. HN increased the content of umami amino acids regardless of pCO(2) condition and sweet amino acids only under HC. Our findings indicate that future ocean acidification may reduce biomass yield of P. yezoensis but increase its color and flavor, which was regulated by nitrate availability.

AB In this study, a simultaneous analytical method of tocols, gamma-oryzanols, phytosterols, squalene, cholecalciferol and phylloquinone were developed using HPLC-DAD-FLD. The developed method allowed the quantification of 18 compounds in 30 min. Method validation showed linearity of calibration curves (alpha = 0.05). RSD of intra-day, inter-day and inter-laboratory precision were less than 4.88%. The limit of detections (LODs) and limit of quantifications (LOQs) were low (0.009-2.166 mu g g(-1)) with recoveries around 96.0-102.9%. Results derived from the established method demonstrated a wide variation of detected compounds in rice bran and vegetable oil samples (22.4-1774.6 mu g g(-1) tocols, ND-26484 mu g g(-1) gamma-oryzanols, ND-12655 mu g g(-1) phytosterols, ND-3189 mu g g(-1) squalene, ND-105.3 mu g g(-1) cholecalciferol, and ND-54.4 mu g g(-1) phylloquinone). Thus, the developed HPLC-DAD-FLD method is a powerful analytical tool for the above mentioned compounds useful in food and pharmaceutical application.

AB This work presents a metabolomics study of cork by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to characterize compounds susceptible to be extracted from cork by the wine in an attempt to find a relationship between the content of these compounds and the geographical origin of cork. Cork from eleven geographical regions was studied, five from Portugal and six from Spain. Unsupervised pattern recognition techniques unveiled three main clusters of regions according to their chemical similarity but not related with geographical proximity. Nineteen compounds were found to be responsible for the clusters, including terpenes (trans-squalene, friedelin, camphene, trans-3-pinanone, 1-terpinen-4-ol, two sesquiterpenes), polyphenols (vescalagin, castalagin), among others (pyrogallol, glucosan, sitost-4-en-3-one, o-cymene, quinic acid, five unknowns). These preliminary results unveiled the potential for a more efficient selection of cork planks for stoppers production based on the compounds susceptible to be extracted from cork by the wine.

AB In this work, response surface methodology and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system approaches were used to predict and model effect of extraction conditions of pectin from medlar fruit (Mespilus germanica L.). The pectin extracted at optimized conditions (89 degrees C, 4.83 h and 4.2 pH) could be classified as high methoxyl pectin. Sugar composition analysis showed that pectin was mainly composed of D-galacturonic acid, c-arabinose, c-rhamnose, D-galactose and D-glucose. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, RAMAN and nuclear magnetic resonance spectra confirmed molecular structure, revealing presence of D-galacturonic acid backbone. X-ray diffraction patterns revealed an amorphous structure. Differential scanning calorimetry showed endothermic (123 degrees C) and exothermic peaks (192 degrees C). Thermogravimetric analysis revealed three decomposition regions, 50-225 degrees C, 225-400 degrees C and 400-600 degrees C. Steady and dynamic shear analyses revealed that pectin had a pseudo-plastic behavior with storage (G') and loss (G '') modulus increasing with increment in frequency, indicating viscoelastic structure more predominantly elastic than viscous.

AB The optimal microwave-assisted extraction conditions of pistachio green hull (PGH) pectin (extraction yield of 18.13%) were in microwave power of 700 W, irradiation time of 165 s, and pH of 1.5. The physico-chemical, structural and functional properties of pectin was examined and the results showed that PGH pectin under optimum conditions was low methoxyl (about 12.1%) with molecular weight of 1.659 kg/mol, emulsifying activity of 58.3%, total phenolic content of 18.18 mg Ga1AE/g pectin and good surface activity (46.23 and 49.75 mN/m at 0.1 and 0.5% w/v). Also, high performance liquid chromatography analysis illustrated that the pectin is including galacturonic acid (66.0%), arabinose (26.2%), galactose (3.7%), rhamnose (2.7%) and xylose (1.0%). In addition, H-1 NMR and FTIR spectrums confirmed the presence of pectin in obtained supenatnt. Surface morphology analysis and X-ray diffraction pattern showed that PGH pectin had a rough surface with crystalline structure.

AB Gaseous ozone has been recently proposed as sanitizing agent to control mycobiota on grapes. The aim of this work was to evaluate the impact of ozone treatment during winegrapes dehydration (10 and 20% weight loss) on the content of phenolic compounds after treatment and their extractability during simulated maceration. The results showed that the ozone effect depends on the profile and content of anthocyanins and flavanols. For varieties characterized by prevalence of di-substituted anthocyanins and high flavanol contents, no significant differences were observed in phenolic compounds contents, but lower anthocyanin extractability was found. Instead, for varieties rich in anthocyanins and with a tri-substituted prevalent profile, lower anthocyanin contents were found at 20% WL, but their extractability was significantly increased. Using multivariate analysis, the extractability was correlated with skin cell wall composition and mechanical properties. Proteins, non-cellulosic glucose and total phenols contributed mainly to explain phenolic compounds extractability in withered grapes.

AB This study aimed to investigate the effect of high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) on the physicochemical characteristics of blended low-protein wheat (LW) and oat flour. Additionally, quality changes in noodles made from blends treated with HHP were investigated. Crude protein and fiber contents of LW were not affected by HHP; however, those of blends were significantly higher than those of LW (p < 0.05). Water-holding capacity (WHC) of blends increased with HHP treatment. The peak viscosity of LW did not differ significantly because of HHP, and the peak and final viscosities of blends increased upon oat flour addition. The hardness, gumminess, chewiness of noodles made using LW improved with the addition of oat flour combined with HHP. The results indicated that the use of blends containing LW and oat flour as well as HHP treatment improved the quality and properties of noodles made using LW.

AB Egg products freshness is a crucial problem for the production of safe and high quality food. Ion Mobility Spectrometry (IMS) coupled to Gas Chromatography (GC), provides a rapid, sensitive, cost-effective tool for the detection of freshness issues. A chemometric model was created recording the volatile fingerprints of the different egg products batches, analyzed as fresh, then left at room temperature and daily controlled: 97% was correctly predicted by the model. Beside this, a selection of chemical marker compounds, coherently related with eggs thermal degradation processes, was also identified through the exploitation of Solid-Phase Micro Extraction Gas Chromatography (SPME-GC-MS) technique and associated to the parallel IMS volatile fingerprinting. The GC-IMS system was successfully challenged with the analysis of mixtures in which the predominant component was fresh egg product and different aged eggs were progressively added as adulterants, certifying the reliability of the method also for the detection of sharper fraudulent activities.

AB The low aqueous solubility, stability and bioavailability of hydrophobic bioactive compounds, such as beta-carotene (beta-c), greatly hinder their application in foods. Nanocarriers could overcome this problem by facilitating the delivery of the functional ingredients. We prepared lactalbumin (alpha-lac) micelles by partial enzymatic hydrolysis in aqueous solution. beta-c can be incorporated into the cores of these micelles via hydrophobic interactions. The aqueous solubility and stability under 60 degrees C heating or UV light irradiation of encapsulated beta-c improved significantly compared with free beta-c. Moreover, it had an increased cellular uptake (3 times) and transmembrane permeability (13 times) in a Caco-2 cell monolayer model. It suggested that alpha-lac micelle-encapsulated beta-c had an enhanced cellular absorption and transport efficiency. Encapsulated beta-c also exhibited an enhanced cellular anti-oxidant activity (CAA) compared with free beta-c. This work demonstrates that alpha-lac micelles showed a great potential for delivery of hydrophobic bioactive compounds in foods.

AB Bioactive peptides have been identified in lactic acid bacteria fermented foods including cultured milk, sourdough, and cured meats; however, their presence has not been investigated in fermented vegetables. In this study, infrared, matrix-assisted laser desorption electrospray ionization (IR-MALDESI) mass spectrometry (MS) was employed to identify bioactive peptides in fermented cucumber. Natural and starter culture fermented cucumbers were prepared in triplicate in sodium chloride brines and compared to acidified cucumbers. Putative matches of known food-derived bioactive peptides were identified by direct analysis using IR-MALDESI-MS. Peptides were confirmed by IR-MALDESI MS/MS and quantified by LC-MS/MS. Three angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptides, IPP (0.42-0.49 mg/kg), LPP (0.30-0.33 mg/kg), and VPP (0.32-0.35 mg/kg) were formed in fermented cucumbers. A fourth ACE inhibitory peptide, KP (0.93-1.5 mg/kg), was enhanced 3-5 fold in fermented cucumbers compared with acidified cucumbers. This work demonstrates that lactic acid bacteria fermentation can enhance bioactive peptide content in vegetables.

AB European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax, Linnaeus, 1758) (L) and gilthead seabream (Spares aurata, Linnaeus, 1758) (C) muscles were hydrolysated by Alcalase (L-alc, C-alc) and Chymotrypsin (L-ch, C-ch) then hydrolysates were examined and their peptide profiles obtained. A total of 765, 794, 132 and 232 peptides were identified in C-alc, L-alc, C-ch, and L-ch, respectively. Although, L-ch and C-ch, were expected to have more antioxidant capacity because of their peptide profiles, Alcalase hydrolysates observed in vitro, were slightly higher (TEAC assay for C-alc: 848.11 +/- 60.78 cool TE/g protein). Maximum inhibition of oxidative stress was determined for L-alc (12.8% +/- 4.5%) in MDCK1 cell lines. Highest proliferative capacity observed for C-alc (147.0% +/- 3.1%) at MTT assay in MDCK1 cell culture. L-ch showed the highest chemopreventive effect with a 40-60% decrease for human colon adenocarcinoma cell line HT-29. This research points out the importance of aquatic sources as raw materials for peptide researches.

AB The adsorption behaviour of catechin onto cellulose and pectin was compared. The adsorption of catechin onto the two fibres involved an initial fast adsorption phase followed by a slower adsorption as the sites became saturated and the systems moved towards equilibrium. The adsorption capacity of pectin for catechin (20.71 +/- 2.24 mg/g) was significantly greater than that of cellulose (2.41 +/- 0.05 mg/g) after equilibration for 24 h at 37 degrees C. The Langmuir and Freundlich models were applied to obtain the quantitative information about the adsorption of catechins to pectin and cellulose. Thermodynamic data derived from the isothermal adsorption carried out at the temperatures of 27 degrees C, 32 degrees C, 37 degrees C and 42 degrees C suggested that the adsorption was spontaneous and the binding was driven predominantly by physisorption. Fluorescence experiments confirmed the adsorption of catechins onto cellulose and pectin. The results showed that catechin adsorption capacity and adsorption mechanism were different for pectin and cellulose.

AB In this study, mesoporous silica SBA-15 was modified by organic functional groups through silanization. Series of organosilane compounds were grafted onto the SBA-15, and the obtained functionalized carriers were then used to immobilize the lipase from Rhizomucor miehei (RML). The enzymatic properties of the obtained immobilized RML samples were evaluated, and the catalytic efficiencies in glycerolysis of triacylglycerols (TAG) reaction were studied. Compared with the parent SBA-15 immobilized RML, the organic modification gave a maximum improvement of enzymatic activity from 200.00 to 13211.11 U/g; in addition, TAG conversion and diacylglycerols (DAG) content increased from 21.28 to 84.24% and 15.45 to 59.03% respectively. The organic modification also decreased the sensitivity of immobilized RML in extreme pH values and increased their thermostability.

AB The oxidative stability of myrtle hydroalcoholic extracts was measured, over storage time, with the EPR spin trapping method under forced ageing conditions. The extracts were prepared with 150 and 300 gl(-1) of berries and extraction media with ethanol ranging from 60 to 90%. Two radicals were detected: the PBN-1-hydroxyethyl adduct and the tert-butyl aminoxyl radical. A dimensionless parameter (Omega) calculated on the basis of the lag time, the rate of formation and concentration of the radical species was used to estimate the extracts' oxidative stability. Omega was strongly influenced by the extraction medium, being lower in extracts with ethanol 60%, and by the time of storage. An inverse correlation was calculated between Omega and ellagic acid concentration, thus suggesting the role of this phenolic acid in the antioxidant properties of the extracts. The radical scavenging activity of the extracts against the hydroxyl radical was also measured.

The study compared extraction yields using UAE and methanol with soxhlet. The effects of three extraction parameters, namely temperature, time and the ratio of solvent (volume) to plant material (weight) were optimized using both a Box-Behnken design (BBD) and response surface methodology (RSM). The highest extraction yields were obtained for UAE at 60 degrees C and 56.5 min with a ratio of solvent to plant material weight of 45:1. The extraction yield using UAE varied by 21.82% (w/w) but was, regardless, significantly greater than Soxhlet extraction.

Species-specific primers were designed, based on the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene. The assay amplified specific DNA fragments from dog (230 bp), duck (283 bp), buffalo (363 bp), goat (396 bp), and sheep (477 bp). The proposed method is capable of identifying target species accurately and is reproducible, sensitive and robust for use with real-world foods and food products. In total, 26 of 117 meat and commercial food products tested were shown to contain DNA from species not declared on the label.

AB The myostatin (mstn) and myostatinb (mstnb) gene of Cranoglanis bouderius were cloned and sequenced and their expressions under nutritional restriction were characterized. The full cDNA sequences of mstn and mstnb were 1878 bp and 1928 bp, containing an open reading frame of 1170 bp and 1119 bp, which encoded 390 and 373 amino acids, respectively. The deduced mstn and mstnb sequence structures were similar to other members of TGF-beta superfamily, including the TGF beta pro-peptide, TGF beta domain, proteolytic processing site and nine conserved cysteines in the C-terminal. In addition, four mstn gene duplications were found in Cranoglanis bouderius. Sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree analyses indicated that the mstn gene and mstnb gene had a close relationship with Siluriformes fish, and the mstn and mstnb genes were roughly classified into two groups. RT-PCR analysis revealed that the mstn and mstnb were expressed in a variety of tissues in Cranoglanis bouderius although the mstn was highly expressed in skeletal muscle and the mstnb was mainly expressed in brain. We speculate that the mstn gene but not mstnb is likely to play a key role in managing muscle growth. A fasting-re-feeding experiment was used to evaluate the effects of starvation on mstn and mstnb expressions in juvenile Cranoglanis bouderius for 5 weeks. The result showed that the mstn and mstnb transcript levels varied among tissues. The mRNA expression levels of mstn in muscle, brain and liver gradually decreased during starvation and returned to the normal level after re-feeding. The mstnb mRNA levels in muscle, brain, liver, spleen, intestine and kidney increased during an early fast time but ultimately decreased with prolonged fasting time. The mstnb transcript levels in muscle, brain and liver increased significantly after re-feeding. In summary, the results supported that the mstn and mstnb may not be limited to control of muscle growth in fish but could also be involved in other biological functions.

AB Medicinal plants, are known to produce a wide range of plant secondary metabolites (PSMs) applied as insecticides, drugs, dyes and toxins in agriculture, medicine, industry and bio-warfare plus bio-terrorism, respectively. However, production of PSMs is usually in small quantities, so we need to find novel ways to increase both quantity and quality of them. Fortunately, biotechnology suggests several options through which secondary metabolism in plants can be engineered in innovative ways to: 1) over-produce the useful metabolites, 2) down-produce the toxic metabolites, 3) produce the new metabolites. Among the ways, RNA interference (RNAi) technology which involves gene-specific regulation by small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) have been recently emerged as a promising tool for plant biotechnologist, not only to decipher the function of plant genes, but also for development of the plants with improved and novel traits through manipulation of both desirable and undesirable genes. Among sncRNAs, miRNAs have been recorded various regulatory roles in plants such as development, signal transduction, response to environmental stresses, metabolism. Certainly, the use of miRNAs in metabolic engineering requires identification of miRNAs involved in metabolites biosynthesis, understanding of the biosynthetic pathways, as well as the identification of key points of the pathways in which the miRNAs have their own effect. Thus, we firstly consider these three issues on metabolic engineering of medicinal plants. Our review shows, application of miRNAs can open a novel perspective to metabolic engineering of medicinal plants.

AB Different diseases have been associated with PARK2/PACRG overlapping promoter polymorphisms (rs2276201 and rs9347683) in the recent past. However association of these polymorphisms with cancer remains elusive till date. Thus in this study we evaluated association between these polymorphisms and colorectal cancer (CRC) incidences among North Indians. Genomic DNA was isolated using venous blood of 400 unrelated subjects (200 CRC cases and 200 healthy controls) of North Indian origin. Both SNPs were genotyped using PCR-RFLP method. Promoter methylation status in tumor DNA was checked using MS-PCR. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS-17 software. In-silico predictions for transcription factor binding were performed using "PROMO" a freely available online tool. SNP rs2276201 showed statistically significant difference (P = 0.047) among cases and controls while rs9347683 did not (P = 0.113). The TC genotype (OR: 1.855, 95% CI: 1.021-3.369, P = 0.043), CC genotype (OR: 1.617, 95% CI: 1.042-2.510, P = 0.032), TT vs CT + CC genetic model (OR: 1.60, P = 0.0158) and allelic model (OR: 1.3931, 95% CI: 1.0498-1.8485, P = 0.0214) of rs2276201 showed significant risk for CRC. For rs9347683 AC genotype (OR: 1.604, 95% CI: 1.019-2.523, P = 0.041) and AA vs AC + CC genetic model (OR: 1.57, P = 0.039) showed significant risk. Haplotype CC provided significant risk (OR: 1.618, 95% CI: 1.112-2.352, P = 0.011) whereas haplotype TA provided significant protection (OR: 0.732, 95% CI: 0.543-0.987, P = 0.040) against CRC. Promoter methylation was significantly higher in tumor grade III + IV (OR: 2.37, P = 0.019), while PARK2 expression was lower in cancer tissues compared to normal tissue. Here we provide the first report where PARK2 promoter SNP's rs2276201 and rs9347683 are shown to be significantly associated with the risk of CRC development.

AB Induction of brown adipocytes in white adipose tissue is a promising therapy for combating human obesity and its associated disorders. Liver kinase B1 (LKB1) is a tumor inhibitor and metabolic modulator. Recent data suggest that LKB1 is necessary for adipogenesis, but its role in the browning of white adipocytes remains unknown. The objective of this study was to reveal the effect of LKB1 on browning. In our study, we showed that overexpression of LKB1 in 3 T3-L1 adipocytes up-regulated the expression of brown adipocyte markers, including UCP1, PGC-1 alpha, Cidea, and PRDM16, and beige-cell-specific genes, such as CD137 and Tmem26. It was possible that the expression of UCP1 and other beige markers was increased by activation of PPAR gamma, resulting in the browning of 3 T3-L1 preadipocytes. The browning effect was abolished by a PPAR gamma inhibitor (GW9662). Moreover, these effects were dramatically abrogated by silencing of LKB1. Additionally, LKB1 decreased the expression levels of adipogenesis proteins (C/EBP alpha and SREBP1) and up-regulated lipid catabolism protein, perilipin (PLIN). In summary, the study suggested that LKB1 induces the browning of white adipocytes, in addition to promoting lipid metabolism. Therefore, LKB1 may be a helpful therapeutic candidate for treating obesity.

AB In a previous study, we showed that transcription factor 21 (TCF21) is methylated and downregulated in human gastric cancer samples and serves as an independent prognostic factor. However, its biological role and potential mechanism in gastric cancer cells remain unexplored. In the current study, we examined TCF21 expression in 6 gastric cancer cell lines. The BGC-823 and SGC-7901 cell lines were selected for small interfering RNA and plasmid transfection, respectively. The results of the Cell Counting Kit-8 assay demonstrated that TCF21 inhibited gastric cancer cell proliferation. Cell cycle analysis suggested that TCF21 inhibited cell cycle progression in gastric cancer cells. The Matrigel invasion assay demonstrated that TCF21 negatively regulated invasion. The cell adhesion assay showed that TCF21 increased cell adhesion. Gastric cancer cells were treated with cisplatin to explore the role of TCF21 in chemoresistance. Cell Counting Kit-8 assay and AnnexinV/propidium iodide analyses showed that TCF21 overexpression sensitized SGC-7901 cells to cisplatin, whereas its depletion reduced sensitivity in BGC-823 cells. JC-1 staining was performed to measure the effect of TCF21 on mitochondrial potential. TCF21 downregulated mitochondrial membrane potential after treatment with cisplatin. Western blot analysis showed that TCF21 overexpression negatively regulated Bcl-xL, phosphorylated extracellular signal regulated kinase, and phosphorylated AKT expression and induced caspase 3 cleavage. LY294002, an AKT inhibitor, blocked the effect of TCF21 on Bcl-xL, caspase 3 and CDDP-induced apoptosis. Nude mice experiments demonstrated that TCF21 inhibited gastric cancer growth in vivo. In conclusion, our results suggest that TCF21 inhibits gastric cancer growth and chemoresistance possibly through the AKT signaling pathway.

AB Armadillo repeat-containing proteins (ARMCs) comprise a large family that is widely distributed in eukaryotes and plays prominent roles in cell-cell adhesion, intracellular signaling, and cytoskeletal regulation. In this study, three ARMC genes, termed LvARMC6, LvARMC7 and LvARMC8, were identified and characterized from Litopenaeus vannamei. The complete cDNAs open reading frames (ORF) of LvARMC6, LvARMC7, and LvARMC8 (GenBank accession no. MG735126, MG728109 and KX058562) were 1410 bp, 570 bp and 2046 bp, encoding 469, 189, and 681 amino acids, respectively. Topology analysis indicated that three ARM domains were present in LvARMC6, one in LvARMC7 and six in LvARMC8. The identities of all the three LvARMCs with other species were between 50% and 71%. Phylogenetic analysis illustrated that different subtype of ARMCs formed their own separate branches and LvARMCs were placed in branch of invertebrates respectively with strong bootstrap support. The constitutive expressions of LvARMCs were confirmed by real-time quantitative PCR. LvARMC6, LvARMC7 and LvARMC8 were expressed highest in heart, gills and epithelium, respectively. After challenge with either white spot syndrome virus (WSSV), Vibrio parahemolyticus, or Staphylococcus aureus, all of the LvARMCs demonstrated differential expression profiles in hemocytes, hepatopancreas, intestine and gills. Taken together, our results suggest that LvARMCs may play a role in the innate immune defense against pathogenic viral and bacterial infections of L. vannamei.

AB Evolutionarily conserved microRNAs such as miR156, miR159, miR167 and miR172 tightly regulate the extensive array of gene expression during flowering in plants, through instant and long-term alterations in the expression of their target genes. Here we employed a novel target-mimicry approach for the diminution of auxin signalling regulator miRNA167 by developing mimic-transgenic lines in tobacco, to investigate the transcriptional biases of flowering-associated miRNAs in apical and floral meristematic tissues and their phenotypic implications. Recorded morpho-alterations such as uneven flowering-time phenotypes, anomalous floral organ formation, and large variations in the seed forming characteristics permitted us to determine the consequence of the extent of miR167 expression diminution accompanying the transcriptional biases of interrelated miRNAs. We demonstrate that percent diminution of miR167 gene expression is proportionally associated with both early and late flowering-time phenotypes in mimic lines. Also, the associated miRNAs, miR156, miR159, and miR172 showed > 90% transcriptional diminution in at least 'early-flowering' miR167 mimic lines. On contrary, low percentages of their respective diminution were recorded in 'late-flowering' lines. Evidently, the misexpression of miR156, miR159, and miR172 led to the over-expression of their respective target genes SPL9, AtMYB33-like and AP2 genes in mimic lines which resulted in assorted phenotypes. We describe the scope of spatial regulation of these microRNAs in floral bud tissues of mimic lines which showed negative- or very low (< 25%) misexpression levels in early/late-flowering lines highlighting their roles in the acquisition of flowering mechanism. To our knowledge, this study represents the first characterization of transcriptional biases of flowering associated miRNAs in miR167-mimic lines and certainly augments our understanding of the importance of microRNA-mediated regulation of flowering in plants.

AB This study elucidates Y chromosome distribution patterns in the three general provincial populations of historical Tibet, Amdo (n = 88), Dotoe (n = 109) and U-Tsang (n = 153) against the backdrop of 37 Asian reference populations. The central aim of this study is to investigate the genetic affinities of the three historical Tibetan populations among themselves and to neighboring populations. Y-SNP and Y-STR profiles were assessed in these historical populations. Correspondence analyses (CA) were generated with Y-SNP haplogroup data. Y-STR haplotypes were determined and employed to generate multidimensional scaling (MDS) plots based on Rst distances. Frequency contour maps of informative Y haplogroups were constructed to visualize the distributions of specific chromosome types. Network analyses based on Y-STR profiles of individuals under specific Y haplogroups were generated to examine the genetic heterogeneity among populations. Average gene diversity values and other parameters of population genetics interest were estimated to characterize the populations. The Y chromosomal results generated in this study indicate that using two sets of markers (Y-SNP, and Y-STR) the three Tibetan populations are genetically distinct. In addition, U-Tsang displays the highest gene diversity, followed by Amdo and Dotoe. The results of this transcontinental biogeographical investigation also indicate various degrees of paternal genetic affinities among these three Tibetan populations depending on the type of loci (Y-SNP or Y-STR) analyzed. The CA generated with Y-SNP haplogroup data demonstrates that Amdo and U-Tsang are closer to each other than to any neighboring non-Tibetan group. In contrast, the MDS plot based on Y-STR haplotypes displays Rst distances that are much shorter between U-Tsang and its geographic nearby populations of Ladakh, Punjab, Kathmandu and Newar than between it and Amdo. Moreover, although Dotoe is isolated from all other groups using both types of marker systems, it lies nearer to the other Tibetan collections in the Y-SNP CA than in the Y-STR MDS plot. High resolution and shallow evolutionary time frames engendered by Y-STR based analyses may reflect a more recent demographic history than that delineated by the more conserved Y-SNP markers.

AB Gastric cancer (GC), one of the most common cancers of the digestive system, results in high morbidity and mortality, but the molecular mechanisms underlying GC remain largely unknown. Cadherin-17 (CDH17) is a nonclassical member of the cadherin (CDH) superfamily of calcium-dependent proteins. Despite recent advances in the understanding of CDH17 biology, the mechanism of CDH17 in GC proliferation, migration, and invasion has not been extensively studied. In the present study, we observed that CDH17 expression was increased in GC tissues compared with para-carcinoma tissues and was correlated with lymph node metastasis and the AJCC stage. Additionally, a significant correlation was found between CDH17 protein expression and the number of blood and lymph vessels in GC tissues. Furthermore, in vitro suppression of CDH17 expression using short-interfering RNA (siRNA) decreased AGS cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Conversely, overexpression of CDH17 through plasmid transfection enhanced the malignant activity of AGS cells. Moreover, CDH17 increased the matrix metallopeptidase 2 (MMP-2) levels via the canonical nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappa B) pathway. Our findings offer new insights into the mechanism of the CDH17/NF-kappa B/MMP-2 axis, and the associated signalling pathways might represent novel targets for the treatment of GC.

AB An increasing number of evidences indicated that long noncoding RNAs (LncRNAs) regulate a variety of biological progresses via different mechanisms. Our previous study had identified a chicken growth hormone receptor (GHR) antisense transcript (GHR-AS) which regulated GHR sense transcript (GHR-S) in LMH cells. In the present study, roles of GHR-AS and its regulatory mechanism were analyzed in chicken hepatocytes. The expression patterns of liver GHR-S, GHR-AS and Let-7b ascended with the development of chicken. The hepatocytes proliferation was promoted and more cells entered into DNA synthesis (S) phase when GHR-AS was over expressed while the cell proliferation was slowed and fewer cells were in S phase when GHR-AS was interfered. Meanwhile, the GHR-S increased when we overexpressed GHR-AS while it reduced when GHR-AS was inhibited. The S1 Nuclease protection assay indicated that GHR-S and GHR-AS formed RNA duplex via GHR-S 3' untranslation regon (3'UTR). In hepatocytes or LMH cells, the half-time of GHR-S showed a delayed trend when GHR-AS or GHR-AS 5' untranslation regon (5'UTR) was overexpressed. Furthermore, the level of GHR-S can be decreased by Let-7b mimics whereas it was partially rescued when co-transfected pGHR-AS or pGHR-AS 5'UTR with Let-7b mimics. Based on our findings, GHR-AS affected hepatocytes proliferation and improved GHR-S stability possibly by forming RNA duplex between GHR-S and GHR-AS, competing with Let-7b.

AB The meshless local Petrov-Galerkin (MLPG) method is applied to the steady-state and k-eigenvalue neutron transport equations, which are discretized in energy using the multigroup approximation and in angle using the discrete ordinates approximation. To prevent oscillations in the neutron flux, the MLPG transport equation is stabilized by the streamline upwind Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG) method. Global neutron conservation is enforced by using moving least squares basis and weight functions and appropriate SUPG parameters. The cross sections in the transport equation are approximated in accordance with global particle balance and without constraint on their spatial dependence or the location of the basis and weight functions. The equations for the strong-form meshless collocation approach are derived for comparison to the MLPG equations. The method of manufactured solutions is used to verify the resulting MLPG method in one, two and three dimensions. Results for realistic problems, including two-dimensional pincells, a reflected ellipsoid and a three-dimensional problem with voids, are verified by comparison to Monte Carlo simulations.

TI A robust MoF method applicable to severely deformed polygonal mesh

ID FLUID INTERFACE RECONSTRUCTION; LEVEL SET METHOD; COMPRESSIBLE FLOW;

AB The MoF (Moment of Fluid) method is an accurate approach for interface reconstruction in numerical simulation of multi-material fluid flow. So far, most works focus on improving its accuracy and efficiency, such as developing analytic reconstruction method and deducing the iteration schemes based on high order derivatives of the objective function. In this paper, we mainly concern on improving its robustness, especially for severely deformed polygonal meshes, in which case the objective function has multiple minimum value points. By using an efficient method for solving multiple roots of the nonlinear equation in large scope, a new algorithm is developed to enhance robustness of the MoF method. The main idea of this algorithm is as follows. The first derivative of the objective function is continuous, so the minimum value points of the objective function must be the zero points of the first derivative. Instead of finding the zero points of the first derivative directly, we turn to calculating the minimum value points (also zero points) of the square of the first derivative, which is a convex function on a neighborhood of each zero point. Applying the properties of convex function, the neighbor of each extreme minimum point of it can be obtained efficiently. Then each zero point of the square of the first derivative can be obtained using the iterative formula in its neighbor. Finally, by comparing the values of the objective function at these zero points of the first derivative, the global minimum value point of the objective function can be found and is the desired solution. The new algorithm only uses the first derivative of the objective function. It doesn't need an initial guess for the solution, which has to be carefully chosen in previous works. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of this new algorithm. The results show that it is applicable to severely deformed polygonal mesh, even with concave cells.

AB The mesh deformation method based on radial basis functions (RBF) has many advantages and is widely used. RBF based mesh deformation method mainly has two steps: data reduction and displacement interpolation. The data reduction step includes solving interpolation weight coefficients and searching for the node with the maximum interpolation error. The data reduction schemes based on greedy algorithm is used to select an optimum reduced set of surface mesh nodes. In this paper, a parallel mesh deformation method based on parallel data reduction and displacement interpolation is proposed. The proposed recurrence Choleskey decomposition method (RCDM) can decrease the computational cost of solving interpolation weight coefficients from O (N-c(4)) to O (N-c(3)), where N-c denotes the number of support nodes. The technology of parallel computing is used to accelerate the searching for the node with the maximum interpolation error and displacement interpolation. The combination of parallel data reduction and parallel interpolation can greatly improve the efficiency of mesh deformation. Two typical deformation problems of the ONERA M6 and DLR-F6 wing-body-Nacelle-Pylon configuration are taken as the test cases to validate the proposed approach and can get up to 19.57 times performance improvement with the proposed approach. Finally, the aeroelastic response of HIRENASD wing-body configuration is used to verify the efficiency and robustness of the proposed method. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Microstructural anisotropy widely exists in the additive manufactured components during the rapid solidification process, slender columnar grains were formed along the building direction due to the higher thermal gradient caused by the previously deposited layer heat sink. The resistance to deformation along the x-axis or y-axis was confirmed to be larger than that of the z-axis both for the bulk and porous selective laser melted 316L, which was attributed to that most of the grain boundaries were perpendicular to the loading direction for the first two axes. However, the anisotropy in the microstructure and mechanical property can be eliminated after recrystallization. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, a novel three dimensional (3D) CdS hierarchical microtremella (MT) is fabricated by a facile solvothermal method at 60 degrees C with the assistance of EDA. Field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) are used to investigate the crystal structure and optical properties of CdS MTs. The results indicated that the size of CdS MTs, in the form of nanosheets, is 0.5-1.5 mu m and the samples are very pure. 0.6 wt% Pt is used as co-catalyst, the H-2 generation rate of CdS MTs under visible light illumination is 2.76 mmol h(-1) g(-1), which is 2.2 times more than CdS nanoparticles without EDT. This work provides insight into the structure design of 3D photocatalysts and offers a new approach to broadband clean energy field. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Dense and stoichiometric NaNbO3 ceramics were difficult to be prepared by conventional sintering methods because Na2O easily volatilized at elevated temperature. In this work, the volatility of Na2O was suppressed by applying an electrical field assisted sintering method. Flash sintering was preformed successfully on NaNbO3 ceramics under the electrical fields ranging from 400 to 700 V/cm. The Na/Nb ratio of dense ceramic remained similar to that of the green sample. Our work demonstrated that flash sintering was an alternative technique for fabricating dense and high-purity ceramics with highly volatile species. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Bioresorbable stents is going to become the future modality for the treatment of coronary artery disease (CAD). However, the main limitation of the polymeric stent is its poor mechanical properties. For the proper functioning of a stent in the artery; it is required to enhance the radial stiffness of the polymeric stent. Polymeric tube manufacturing is the first and most important step in the stent manufacturing process. Usually, post processing operation which enhances the mechanical properties such as annealing, blowing and die drawing near glass transition are used after tube extrusion. In this study, along with conventional tube extrusion process (SE), a single step biaxial expansion method (BAE) was employed during the tube extrusion. The effect of manufacturing method on the radial compressive strength of the extruded tubes is thereby evaluated. For further determining the tubes radial resistive force, parallel plate crush testing as per ISO 25539-2 was performed and it is observed that tubes extruded by BAE method have better performance during crush testing as compared to the SE tubes of the same material. SEM was used for observing the cross-sectional morphology of the Cryo-fractured surface of fabricated bioresorbable tubes. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of this work is to study the effect of PAMAM-GO (fGO) on the crystallization properties of poly (lactic acid) (PLA). The results demonstrate that the isothermal crystallization rates are prominently enhanced with the addition of fGO. The spherulitic size of PLA in the composites are remarkably reduced in comparison with PLA, while crystallization half-time of PLA/fGO is almost decreased by 18.3%. Based on the results of this work, the use of fGO can serve as efficient heterogeneous nucleating agent for adjustable crystallization of PLA. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Fe3O4 hollow nanospheres-carbon nanotubes (Fe3O4 HNSs-CNTs) nanocomposites were synthesized under one-pot solvothermal treatment. The crystalline structure, size and morphology of the composite products are characterized by XRD, SEM and TEM, indicating that Fe3O4 HNSs are tightly wrapped by CNTs with a good distribution. The products were dispersed in silicone oil for evaluating the dielectric heating performance under microwave irradiation. The Fe3O4 HNSs-CNTs nanocomposite (mass ratio 1:9) exhibits the best dielectric heating performance under microwave irradiation among all products, probably because an optimized proportion of Fe3O4 HNSs can improve the joint heating effect where the Fe3O4 HNSs as bridges between CNTs strengthen the interfacial polarization. The nanocomposites can be totally separated from the liquid medium by magnetic decantation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Multimodal imaging, which can combine information from different imaging modalities, offers huge advantages. Among various multifunctional images, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) combination with fluorescence imaging has attracted considerable attention for their potential biomedical applications. In this study, we present a facile method for fabrication of core-shell-structured nanocomposite particles. First, Fe2O3 nanoparticles were synthesized as the magnetic core. Then, the Fe2O3 nanoparticles were covered with a silica shell. Carbon dots and PEG could be absorbed into the mesoporous silica layer and then sealed by a dense silica layer (denoted as Fe2O3@SiO2/CDs/PEG@nSiO(2)). The results show that the as-prepared nanocomposite has a uniform size, strong magnetization and good fluorescence properties, which has application as a bioimaging probe. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Graphene nanomaterials have rapidly developed in recent years. However, its antimicrobial activity does not achieve satisfactory effect. During the past years, it has been found that antimicrobial peptides (AMP) have a good inhibitory effect on pathogenic microbes. In this study, we synthesized AMP-grafted graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets, i.e., D28@GO, against the pathogens such as Candida albicans and Escherichia coli. Growth inhibition assays showed that D28@GO had strong inhibitory effect against the pathogens and this toxicity contributes to cell membrane damage caused by interaction between D28@GO and macrobiomolecules. In vivo experiments further showed that D28@GO severely suppressed systemic infections of pathogens. This study provides novel light on development of GO-based antimicrobial materials.

AB In this paper, we report on the crystal structure, magnetic and local ferroelectric properties of the Bi1-xCaxFe1-x/2Nbx/2O3 (x <= 0.2) compounds prepared by a solid state reaction method. The chemical substitution has been found to reduce the polar ionic displacements in the acentric R3c structure and give rise to the formation of the non-polar Pnma phase at x = 0.2. The substitution-driven decrease of spontaneous polarization is accompanied by the suppression of the cycloidal antiferromagnetic order specific to the parent BiFeO3. As a result, a weak ferromagnetic and ferroelectric state is formed at x approximate to 0.18. Lattice defects contribute to the instability of the cycloidal structure, thus providing the antiferromagnetic + weak ferromagnetic phase coexistence observed over a wide range of Ca/Nb concentrations.

AB WO3 center dot H2O hierarchical structures assembled by nanorods or nanosheets were successfully synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method. Gas sensing behaviors were investigated for these two different nanostructures towards ethanol gas. The results indicated that the nanorods assembled flower-like structure exhibits faster response and recovery time as compared with the nanosheets assembled microspheres, which may be attributed to fast gas diffusion speed in the nanorods assembled nanostructures, while the nanosheets assembled hierarchical flower-like WO3 center dot H2O structures exhibited higher response (54) than that of the WO3 center dot H2O microspheres (25) because of the larger specific surface area and the abundant micro reaction rooms.

AB Hot isostatic pressing (HIP) is considered as an effective means in healing micro-defects inside the superalloy. However, can HIP effectively heal macro defect? Here we design a sealed cavity inside the superalloy to simulate the millimeter-sized cavity defect and focus on its healing behavior by HIP. Results show that HIP has the potential to heal the millimeter-scale cavity and the main mechanism is diffusion based on the features of diffusion zone and honeycomb structure during healing process. This exploratory work helps to better understand and broaden the applications of HIP and make the manufacturing sustainable. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID CATHODE PERFORMANCE
AB A nano-magnesium nickel oxide-mesoporous carbon/sulfur composites (Mg0.6Ni0.4O-MPC/S) was designed and prepared for lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. With a specific surface area as high as 1001.2 m(2) g(-1) and a unique porous structure, MPC in the composites can not only absorb the polysulfides generated during charge-discharge process to slow down the shuttle effect, but provide Li+ with a transmission channel. Nano-Mg0.6Ni0.4O (40 nm) particles, as an additive fabricated by self-propagating high temperature synthesis, can promote chemical bond dissociation with polysulfides and accelerate the electrochemical reaction rate. The composites loaded with 59 wt% sulfur exhibit a high initial capacity of 1360 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C and 695 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles, proving that the synergistic effect between MPC and Nano-Mg0.6Ni0.4O leads to good cycle stability of the batteries.

AB Graphene derivatives are useful in sensing applications owing to the exciting electrical, chemical, mechanical and structural properties. In this regard, graphene foam (GF) might have fruitful influence for sensing applications due to its porous morphology. However, lack of surface functionalities bottleneck its use in gas sensors but graphene oxide (GO) contains surface functionalities which have already been very useful for sensing application point of view. Herein, we fabricated GF via Chemical Vapor Deposition and GO via Hummers method. Both GF and GO are accessed by using different characterization tools and GO coated GF is used for sensing different alcohols (i.e. Isopropanol, Ethanol, and Methanol). The GO/GF system is highly sensitive to isopropanol due to the presence of high/low energy binding sights on the surface and molecular structure of isopropanol. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Corresponding strain mapping on the cluster was generated by GPA. Excess free volume on the interface and induced strain were applied to explain the existence of tilted arranged, periodic present clusters at the interface. The clusters, which were Gd and Ni enriched based on the EDS measurement, were periodically arranged based on the stacking sequence of LPSO structure. The strong strain field and the interaction of dislocation dipoles contributed to the tilted atomic arrangement within the cluster. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

UV-vis and photoluminescence (PL) measurements indicated that the absorbance and PL intensity corresponding to SWNT in SWNT-Pyr-PEIs increased with increasing the content of the PEI unit in the composites. The electrical conductivities of SWNT-Pyr-PEIs were higher than that of pristine SWNT owing to n-doping, based on electron migration from the PEI unit to the SWNT. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Non-stoichiometric Li3Mg2+xNbO6 ceramics were prepared by the solid-state reaction process. The effects of additional magnesium contents on the microstructure, sintering behavior and dielectric performance of Li3Mg2+xNbO6 ceramics were investigated systematically. XRD patterns and Rietveld refinement indicated that all of the samples exhibited a single-phase orthorhombic structure. The epsilon(r) was dependent on the density and Q x f values were affected by the microstructure and density. Additionally, the tau(f) values were related to the NbO6 octahedron distortion. Remarkably, the Li3Mg2.04NbO6 ceramics sintered at 1100 degrees C had outstanding microwave dielectric characteristics: epsilon(r) = 16, Q x f = 140,000 GHz, tau(f) = -5.6 ppm/degrees C, making these ceramics promising candidates for millimeter-wave applications.

AB Silica xerogels doubly-doped with Eu3+ and Tb3+ ions were prepared via low-temperature sol-gel method. The structural properties were determined based on X-ray diffraction analysis. The optical properties were studied based on excitation and emission spectra as well as luminescence decay analysis and the Tb3+ -> Eu3+ energy transfer was registered. Upon direct excitation of Tb3+ ions the characteristic transitions from the D-5(4) state of Tb3+ and from the D-5(0) state of Eu3+ were registered. This is a direct proof that energy transfer from Tb3+ to Eu3+ in silica xerogels was occurred. Furthermore, the luminescence decay analysis from the D-5(0) excited states of Eu3+ upon excitation of Tb3+ at lambda(exc) = 351 nm wavelength were also carried out. The luminescence lifetime from the D-5(0) state of Eu3+ after excitation at 351 nm is long-lived in comparison to excitation at 393 nm and increased by 24%. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

ID METAL-MATRIX COMPOSITES; PARTICLES
AB In this work, Ti23Cu75 melt-spun partially amorphous alloy was used as a source of Ti and Cu to synthesize in-situ TiC-Cu nanocomposites. The reaction between the alloy and carbon started during ball milling and continued during Spark Plasma Sintering. At the same time, during ball milling, the alloy experienced phase transformations: crystallization of the amorphous phase was followed by decomposition of TiCu3. Copper crystallites formed during the alloy transformations were the reason for the presence of copper regions 0.5-1 mu m in size free from TiC nanoparticles in the sintered composites. The Ti-Cu intermetallics transformed into non-agglomerated TiC 10-20 nm in size distributed in the copper matrix. The hardness of the synthesized TiC-Cu nanocomposites exceeded that of composites obtained by conventional sintering of ball-milled Ti-C-Cu powders. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Hierarchical porous carbon was synthesized from porphyra using nickel nanoparticles as the template for mesopore formation and as a catalyst for carbon graphitization. The porphyra-derived carbon (PDC) showed a high degree of graphitization (I-G/I-D = 4.17) and N-doping (5.32%). The reversible capacity of PDC was 1006.4 mAh/g at 0.1 A/g and 278.2 mAh/g at 5.0 A/g. Moreover, PDC demonstrated the reversible capacity of 520.8 mAh/g after 500 cycles at 1.0 A/g with 92.3% capacity retention rate. The PDC can be served as an advanced anode material for high-energy rechargeable lithium-ion batteries. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Visible-light photocatalyst titanium dioxide (TiO2) was successfully prepared via a novel and facile single-mode microwave assisted synthesis process. In this one-step synthesis, Ti3+ as target material selectively oxidizes in magnetic field throughout rapid heating, whose process requires less energy consumption and short time. In obtained TiO2, self-doping of Ti3+ was confirmed, which makes TiO2 perform sufficient light absorption in visible region with wavelength above 400 nm. Such Ti3+ self-doped TiO2 exhibits much narrower optical bandgap (2.14 eV) with compared stoichiometric TiO 2 (3.0-3.2 eV). The synthesized TiO2 also shows superior photocatalytic activity to commercially available TiO2 towards the degradation of Rhodamine B under visible light irradiation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

SO MATERIALS LETTERS

ID OXYGEN PLASMA
AB MoS2 has attracted considerable attention given its excellent optoelectronic properties arising from the quantum size effect. Intrinsic defects, especially sulfur vacancies, are common in the as-prepared MoS2 monolayer, significantly restricting monolayer photoluminescence. An efficient method is reported in this paper to passivate the sulfur vacancies of the MoS2 monolayer through low-power-density Ar/O-2 plasma treatment. The photoluminescence spectrum shows a dramatic enhancement of similar to 150 times, attributed to the transition from trion to exciton and the inhibition of a non-radiative recombination of photo-excitons. Measurement results indicate the formation of Mo-O bonds in the plasma-treated MoS2 monolayer without an obvious etching effect. The strong photoluminescence intensity of the monolayer may have promising applications in optoelectronic devices. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, an advanced stretchable characteristic of liquid metal (LM) was revealed for fabricating a highly stretchable and extremely stable conductor. Thanks to the deformable advantage of LM droplets continuously connected in polyurethane (PU) matrix, the stretchable conductor with outstanding conductivity (165.5 S/cm) exhibits extreme stability that the resistance change is less than 300% even strain up to 500%. The stretchable conductor with advanced stretchable characteristic obviously surpasses the common conductors that utilize brittle conductive nanomaterials (i.e. graphene (GE), carbon nanotubes (CNT), silver (Ag) and copper (Cu)) and such advanced characteristic of LM makes it attractive in various stretchable electronic devices.

The proposed sensitive and non-enzymatic H2O2 biosensor, based on N-doped graphene/porous Fe2O3 NRs (N-rGO/Fe2O3 NRs), exhibits good stability and reproducibility under the optimal experimental conditions. Furthermore, this H2O2 biosensor was also utilized to detect H2O2 in real sample (orange juice) and high selectivity towards H2O2 was found. Therefore, the porous N-rGO/Fe2O3 NRs composite is thought of as a potential material in biosensing and bioanalysis. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID CEMENTITIOUS MATERIAL; CONSTRUCTION
AB Geopolymer has been applied to accommodate the rapid development of 3D printing in civil engineering practices and contributed this technique to reach its maximum eco-friendly potentials by eliminating the use of Portland cement. However, inherent problems with 3D printing concrete lie in the low tensile strength and poor ductility due to non-reinforcement, which greatly limit the application of 3D printing materials and structures. Hence, this study experimentally explores the feasibility of directly entraining a continuous micro steel cable (1.2 mm) during filaments (12 mm) deposition process, forming a reinforced geopolymer composite material. Three different printing path configurations are deigned to verify the applicability of micro-cable reinforced geopolymer composite for extrusion-based 3D printing. Flexural bending capacities of the proposed composite is measured and evaluated through four-point bending test. The results prove the well bonding and coordination of the micro-cable and geopolymer. Significant improvement of mechanical strength, toughness and post-cracking deformation of geopolymer composite are demonstrated. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID TITANIUM NITRIDE FILMS; RADICAL OXIDATION; ENERGY
AB Transition metal nitrides (TMN) films, fabricated by physical vapor deposition (PVD), have attracted much attention in supercapacitor electrode applications due to their high conductivity, easily-controlled composition, high structural and chemical stability, and good cycling life, which are promising candidates for flexible thin-film supercapacitors and on-chip micro-supercapacitors. The main drawback of the PVD-TMN film electrodes is that they have relatively dense structure and smooth surface, which limits their specific surface area and capacitive performance of the supercapacitors. In this work, a novel strategy was employed to modify the surface morphology of TMN films by plasma etching technology. HfN films with high conductivity were chosen to be deposited by reactive DC magnetron sputtering, followed by plasma etching using Ar and Kr gases. Effects of plasma etching on the microstructure, surface morphology and electrochemical properties of the HfN films were investigated. The results indicated that plasma etching significantly changed the surface morphology and enhanced specific capacitance of the HfN films. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Carbon quantum dots (CQDs) with easier preparation, lower manufacture cost and fluorescent feature caught extensive interests. Herein, a technique of synthesizing a novel cationic surfactant, derived from CQDs via chemical modification, was reported in this work in detail. Firstly, the CQDs were synthesized by aqueous solutions of citric acid and 3-(dimethylamino)-1-propylamine under hydrothermal condition at 180 degrees C for 60 min. Then the CQDs reacted with excess 1-chlorododecane in alcohol medium via quaterisation for synthesizing the CQDs cationic surfactant. During the processes, the solvent alcohol as well as the excess of 3-(dimethylamino)-1-propylamine and 1-chlorododecane could be isolated efficiently and recycled. The experimental results showed that the CQDs cationic surfactant possessed versatility such as a good performance of reducing the surface tension of water, wonderful antibacterial effect on colibacillus at a lower concentration and a high fluorescent quantum yield.

AB Mn1.56CO0.96Ni0.48O4 (MCN) thin films were deposited on amorphous Al2O3 substrates by radio frequency magnetron sputtering at a relatively low temperature (450 degrees C). The films were annealed at 450 degrees C, 600 degrees C and 750 degrees C for 20 min respectively. The structural property was characterized and the result indicated post annealing had important impact on crystallinity and surface morphology of the films. Temperature dependent resistivity test revealed that the MCN films possess moderate resistivity, low negative temperature coefficient and favorable characteristic temperature. The method of preparing MCN films with favorable performance at 450 degrees C is expected to be compatible with standard silicon industry process and has great significance for developing linear or focal plane devices with MCN thin film.

AB In this study, the Ni-doped solder alloy led to joints with improved shear performance and Sn-3.0Ag-0.5Cu-0.1Ni/Ni joint showed the highest strength. The mechanical response under shear testing depended on the microstructure of the solder zone. Doping minor Ni into the solder ball modified the evolution of the solder microstructure, leading to (Cu,Ni)(6)Sn-5 precipitation in the solder zone and consequently strengthening the Ni-doped joints. Additionally, the pre-existence of Ni in the solder alloy is necessary for triggering the precipitation of (Cu,Ni)(6)Sn-5 particles in solder. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Pristine electric arc furnace slag (EAFS) as well as EAFS modified by alkali activation i.e. alkali activated slag (AAS) have found a novel application as adsorbents used in Cu2+ removal from sulfate solutions. The adsorption tests were carried in batch conditions and results have shown that alkali activation of EAFS enhances the Cu2+ adsorption. The adsorption process was found to follow a pseudo second-order kinetic model and occurs via formation of posnjakite (Cu-4(SO4)(OH)(6)center dot H2O) on the surface of both, EAFS and AAS. Enhanced adsorption properties of AAS, compared to EAFS, are attributed to a more porous structure, larger specific surface area and an increased number of surface groups involved in the binding of Cu2+.

AB Aiming to develop a possible approach to precisely control the degradation rate of long period stacking order (LPSO) structured Mg-Zn-Y-Zr alloys in NaCl solution, this work investigates the degradation behavior and the relation between degradation rate and two key microstructural parameters, namely grain size and volume fraction of LPSO phase. Experimental results indicate the numerical relation between degradation rate and these two microstructural parameters. Mathematical processing of interpolation, regression and data fitting is used to establish the quantitative relations among volume fraction of LPSO phase, grain size and degradation rate.

AB In this study, a simple environmentally greener "in situ" chemical synthesis has been developed to prepare silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) from chemically reduced AgNO3 in an aqueous media of thermoresponsive microgel, using glucose as a reducing agent and by adopting a microwave irradiation technique. The thermo-responsive microgel poly-N-isopropylacrylamide-co-2-hydroxyethyl acrylate, poly (NIPAM-co-HEA) 200 nm in size was prepared by surfactant free emulsion polymerisation of a selected mixture of N-isopropylacrylamide, methylene-bis-acrylamide and 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate. This microgel acts as a mere support to immobilize Ag NPs. The formation of Ag NPs and the thermo-responsive properties of the mixture were studied using UV-visible Spectroscopy. Their structures were characterised by FE-SEM and TEM. The Ag NPs prepared by this approach appear to be monodispersed with sizes which are <15 nm. Excellent biocompatibility, cell viability and environmentally responsive properties suggested that as-prepared composite particles are ideal candidate for antibacterial, biosensors and drug delivery applications.

AB Multifunctional scaffolds were prepared by foaming Fe-containing sols according to a composition-optimized approach. These foams exhibited high specific surface area (16-80 m(2)/g) and hierarchical porosity from the macro- (50-600 mu m) to the meso-scale (4-20 nm). The effects of iron content on the textural properties and in vitro bioactivity were investigated. It was observed that the increase of iron content involved a decrease of specific surface and mesopore size. Interestingly, an excellent apatite-forming ability was observed regardless of the material composition. The potential osteoconductivity of these bioactive foams, coupled with their ferrimagnetic properties, open new perspectives as regards the hyperthermia-assisted treatment and regeneration of osseous defects caused by bone cancer.

AB High thermal conductivity, low viscosity and high transparency are desired properties of die attach adhesives (DAA) for LEDs to achieve high thermal and optical performance as well as good reliability. However, it is challenging for DAAs with thermally conductive fillers to keep a low viscosity and high transparency. In this paper, a novel DAA with designed hyper-branched epoxy-silicone and surface modified fused silica was formulated to improve the thermal conductivity without sacrificing high transparency and low viscosity. Compared with a widely used commercial DAA, 165% thermal conductivity improvement and 83% viscosity reduction are achieved, resulting in 26% thermal resistance reduction, 7% light extraction enhancement, and 14% less lumen degradation in accelerate aging test for mid-power LED packages.

AB Pure Zn and Zn-0.5%Li(wt) alloys were cast and extruded into the rods in this study. The micro structure and mechanical properties of Zn, Zn-0.5%Li and its mini tube were evaluated. With the addition of Li, both the UTS and elongation of extruded Zn-0.5%Li alloy increases to 364.9 MPa and 22% compared with Zn. The mini tube made of Zn-0.5%Li alloy shows the UTS of 296.2 MPa and elongation of 33%. The main strengthening mechanism of Zn-Li alloy is attribute to the pinning effects caused by nano LiZn4 precipitates. In conclusion, Zn-Li mini tube could be considered as potential absorbable stent material. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Carbon fiber (C fiber) toughening nanoscale Al2O3-ZrO2 eutectic was prepared by ultrasonic-assisted directed laser deposition (DLD). The eutectic spacing detected by TEM was 50 +/- 5 nm, which was 5-30% of the Al2O3-ZrO2 eutectic. The reasons for the decrease of eutectic spacing were analyzed from two aspects: ultrasonic-assisted and C fiber addition. The fracture toughness was 8.7 +/- 0.2 MPa m(1/2) measured by indentation crack length, which was about 2.5 times higher than Al2O3-ZrO2 eutectic. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Generally, minor elements such as carbon and boron are added in superalloys to strengthen grain boundaries. However, effects of carbon and boron on single crystal superalloys remain disputed. Here we demonstrate that M23B6 (where M is mixture of W, Mo, Cr and Ni) can induce dislocation channeling in a Ni-based single crystal superalloy. The M23B6 has a cube-on-cube orientation relationship with the matrix, forming a majority of {1 1 1} plane interfaces. Furthermore, the atomic stepped {1 1 1} interface could facilitate dislocation nucleation. Dislocations emitted from the interface glide forward and pile-up in the channel, resulting in strain localization and creep micro-crack initiation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The effects of Mn-doping on the structural evolution of beta-Tricalcium Phosphate were studied using X-ray powder diffraction with Rietveld refinement and Raman spectroscopy. The lattice parameters and unite cell volumes decrease with the increase of Mn-doping without changing their R3c space group. Ca(5) and Ca(4) sites could be substituted by Mn2+. The manganese substitution resulted in the structural instability and distortion, which also could generate the shift of Raman peaks. The broad band assigned to Ca-PO43 was changed from 272 cm(-1) to 292 cm(-1), which may indicate the decreasing of bond lengths between Ca(Mn) and PO43. This work may benefit for the further study of the structure-property relationship of beta-Tricalcium Phosphate. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work the CH3NH3PbIxCl3-x perovskite is obtained by applying vacuum-rotary evaporation procedure with a precursor solution of PbCl2 and CH3NH3I in dimethylformamide. Thermal gravimetric and differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA) and the variable temperature powder X-ray diffraction (in situ XRD) are employed to research the effect of thermal treatment on the decomposition and the crystal structure of perovskite. It is found that tetragonal to cubic phase transition in the typical perovskite disappears in mixed perovskite crystals because the stabilizing action of Cl. The excess Cl in the precursor leads to the intermediate structure CH3NH3PbCl3, and then transforms into CH3NH3PbI3 with temperature increasing. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Quaternization on polyetheretherketone and its antimicrobial activity

ID MEMBRANE
AB Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) is a thermoplastic polymer with high performances, especially behaving an elastic modulus closer to that of human bone, and has been a good candidate for implants in orthopedics and trauma. But infections arising from the use of implants or the surgical site contaminant are very common in surgery. So in this study, PEEK was firstly chloromethylated to get CM-PEEK, which was separately grafted with two kinds of quaternary ammonium salts and successfully made two different antibacterial surfaces (S-PEEK and C-PEEK). The results indicate that the wettability of both surfaces was largely improved, and both S-PEEK and C-PEEK exhibited an antibacterial rate of over 98% to S. aureus and over 48% to E. coli. This study suggests that quaternization on PEEK might be an excellent method to make antibacterial biomaterials with high wettability. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This article demonstrates the fabrication of ZnO nanowires using the VLS technique for the development of an optical biosensor to detect thiolated oligonucleotide probe labeled by cy5. In the present work, the development of the two different morphologies of nanowires (i.e., random and straight orientation) was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). After that, surface functionalization of both kinds of orientations of nanowires were carried out using thiolated oligonucleotide, and interaction mechanism between the DNA and ZnO nanowires were studied. Later on, surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and photoluminescence (PL) characterization techniques were carried out to study the transformation induced on the optical properties as a result of the modified surface properties of the nanowires, and a brief comparison was carried out. Present work could provide a good basis for the development of new type of optical biosensor for the detection of wide series of biological molecules. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We describe a local iterative corrector scheme that significantly improves the accuracy of the multiscale finite element method (MsFEM). Our technique is based on the definition of a local corrector problem for each multiscale basis function that is driven by the residual of the previous multiscale solution. Each corrector problem results in a local corrector solution that improves the accuracy of the corresponding multiscale basis function at element interfaces. We cast the strategy of residual-driven correction in an iterative scheme that is straightforward to implement and, due to the locality of corrector problems, wellsuited for parallel computing. We show that the iterative scheme converges to the best possible fine-mesh solution. Finally, we illustrate the effectiveness of our approach with multiscale benchmarks characterized by missing scale separation, including the microCT-based stress analysis of a vertebra with trabecular microstructure.

AB We introduce in this paper 'A-SLEIPNNIR' ("Adaptive Semi-Lagrangian Ensemble Implementation of Particle level set for Newtonian and non-Newtonian Interfacial Rheology"). The proposed method combines a semi-Lagrangian approach for the transport operator, a particle level set technique for interface capturing featuring second-order accurate redistancing, and anisotropic mesh refinement for spatial resolution. The high-order, quadratic Finite Element discretization, together with an a posteriori error analysis produce a metric tensor that is passed on to an anisotropic mesh generator. We explore the peculiar features of the numerical scheme such as the impact of the marker particles, the reinitialization procedure or the Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) strategy, in a series of benchmark problems for the solution of the interface transport equation with analytically supplied, divergence-free velocity fields. The results show that our approach yields an accurate and robust, yet computationally inexpensive framework for moving interfaces suitable for Scientific and Engineering applications.

AB Local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) methods are popular for convection-diffusion equations. In LDG methods, we introduce an auxiliary variable p to represent the derivative of the primary variable u, and solve them on the same mesh. It is well known that the maximum-principle-preserving (MPP) LDG method is only available up to second-order accuracy. Recently, we introduced a new algorithm, and solve u and p on different meshes, and obtained stability and optimal error estimates. In this paper, we will continue this approach and construct MPP third-order LDG methods for convection-diffusion equations on overlapping meshes. The new algorithm is more flexible and does not increase any computational cost. Numerical evidence will be given to demonstrate the accuracy and good performance of the third-order MPP LDG method.

SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS
LA English
DT Article
DE Tensor networks; Singular value decomposition
ID APPROXIMATION; NETWORKS; COMPUTATION; FORMAT; MATRIX
AB Tensors are a natural way to express correlations among many physical variables, but storing tensors in a computer naively requires memory which scales exponentially in the rank of the tensor. This is not optimal, as the required memory is actually set not by the rank but by the mutual information amongst the variables in question. Representations such as the tensor tree perform near-optimally when the tree decomposition is chosen to reflect the correlation structure in question, but making such a choice is non-trivial and good heuristics remain highly context-specific. In this work I present two new algorithms for choosing efficient tree decompositions, independent of the physical context of the tensor. The first is a brute-force algorithm which produces optimal decompositions up to truncation error but is generally impractical for high-rank tensors, as the number of possible choices grows exponentially in rank. The second is a greedy algorithm, and while it is not optimal it performs extremely well in numerical experiments while having runtime which makes it practical even for tensors of very high rank.

AB In spite of considerable progress, computing curvature in Volume of Fluid (VOF) methods continues to be a challenge. The goal is to develop a function or a subroutine that returns the curvature in computational cells containing an interface separating two immiscible fluids, given the volume fraction in the cell and the adjacent cells. Currently, the most accurate approach is to fit a curve (2D), or a surface (3D), matching the volume fractions and finding the curvature by differentiation. Here, a different approach is examined. A synthetic data set, relating curvature to volume fractions, is generated using well-defined shapes where the curvature and volume fractions are easily found and then machine learning is used to fit the data (training). The resulting function is used to find the curvature for shapes not used for the training and implemented into a code to track moving interfaces. The results suggest that using machine learning to generate the relationship is a viable approach that results in reasonably accurate predictions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Non Destructive Examination (NDE) of industrial structures requires the modeling of specimen geometry echoes generated by the surfaces (entry, backwall ...) of inspected blocks. For that purpose, the study of plane wave diffraction by a wedge is of great interest. The work presented here is preliminary research to model the case of an elastic wave diffracted by a wedge in the future, for which there exist various modeling approaches but the numerical aspects have only been developed for wedge angles lower than n. The spectral functions method has previously been introduced to solve the 2D diffraction problem of an immersed elastic wedge for angles lower than pi. As a first step, the spectral functions method has been developed here for the diffraction on an acoustic wave by a stress-free wedge, in 2D and for any wedge angle, before studying the elastic wave diffraction from a wedge. In this method, the solution to the diffraction problem is expressed in terms of two unknown functions called the spectral functions. These functions are computed semi-analytically, meaning that they are the sum of two terms. One of them is determined exactly and the other is approached numerically, using a collocation method. A successful numerical validation of the method for all wedge angles is proposed, by comparison with the GTD (Geometrical Theory of Diffraction) solution derived from the exact Sommerfeld integral.

AB The problem of constructing Monte-Carlo solutions of drift-diffusion systems corresponding to Fokker-Planck equations with sources and sinks is revisited. Firstly, a compact formalism is introduced for the specific problem of stationary solutions. This leads to identification of the dwell time as the key quantity to characterize the system and to obtain a proper normalization for statistical analysis of numerical results. Secondly, the question of appropriate track length estimators for drift-diffusion systems is discussed for a 1D model system. It is found that a simple track length estimator can be given only for pure drift motion without diffusion. The stochastic nature of the diffusive part cannot be appropriately described by the path length of simulation particles. Further analysis of the usual situation with inhomogeneous drift and diffusion coefficients leads to an error estimate based on particle trajectories. The result for limits in grid cell size and time step used for the construction of Monte-Carlo trajectories resembles the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy and von Neumann conditions for explicit methods.

AB The article reports on the influence of a compressive macrostress sigma in the Ti(Al,V)N films on their mechanical properties, structure, microstructure, and resistance to cracking. The macrostress sigma is controlled by the energy epsilon(bi), delivered into the growing film by bombarding ions. The Ti(Al,V)N films were sputtered by a dual magnetron with closed magnetic field. It is shown that (1) the compressive macrostress (sigma < 0) increases the hardness H of the film and the ratio H/E*, (2) the films exhibits a dense, voids-free, non-columnar microstructure in the case when the energy epsilon(bi) >= 3 MJ/cm(3), (3) the enhanced resistance to cracking of the films is controlled by its mechanical properties, microstructure and macrostress sigma; here E* is the effective Young's modulus.

AB The defect structure model based on the single reaction of water incorporation, involving structural oxygen vacancies, was discussed and successfully verified using existing PH2O - T - x data for cubic Ba4Ca2Nb2O11 center dot xH(2)O - a promising electrolyte material for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells. As a result, the enthalpy of hydration (Delta H degrees(hydr)) was obtained. It was found to be close to the partial molar enthalpy of water in Ba4Ca2Nb2O11 center dot xH(2)O as well as to the calorimetrically measured value of Delta H degrees(hydr) = -107.9 +/- 14.4 kJ/mol of H2O. Using Delta H degrees(hydr) and the value of low-temperature heat of hydration, the enthalpy of the hydration-induced cubic -> monoclinic phase transition in Ba4Ca2Nb2O11 center dot 0.92H(2)O was calculated as 63.9 +/- 14.2 kJ/mol of Ba4Ca2Nb2O11.

AB The key factors determining the applicability of mixed-conducting oxides in energy-related technologies refer to the stability to reduction and the level of oxygen ionic and electronic transport, both determined by partial molar enthalpy and entropy of oxygen in the oxide. Therefore, any information about the thermodynamic properties of the oxide has an important predictive value.
   The chemical potential of oxygen in La0.49Sr0.5-xFeO3-delta relative to the standard state in the gas phase, Delta mu(o), was calculated using experimental data on oxygen content in oxides depending on the partial pressure of oxygen, p(o2), and temperature. The partial molar enthalpy, Delta(H) over bar (o), and partial molar entropy, Delta(S) over bar (o), of oxygen were determined as functions of (3-delta) from Delta mu(o) data using the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation. The previously proposed defect equilibrium model assuming the presence of unavailable oxygen vacancies in barium-containing oxides was successfully verified. Thermodynamic quantities Delta(H) over bar (o) and Delta(S) over bar (o), obtained by statistical thermodynamic calculation based on this model were found to be in a reasonable agreement with those obtained with the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation. The performed calculations allowed enhancing the accuracy of the defect equilibrium model parameters. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The structural, optical, and electrical properties of the nonpolar p-DBRs were characterized with various kinds of technical tools. The measurement results demonstrate that a stopband centered at 390 nm with a peak reflectivity of 55% was achieved. Meanwhile, a relatively high reflectivity (>35%) could also be obtained within the wavelength range of 270-320 nm for the nonpolar p-DBR which was intended to be a reflector with a working wavelength at 280 nm. Additionally, a hole concentration higher than 2 x 10(17) cm(3) was obtained with the nonpolar p-DBRs. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Composite materials have been widely used in the field of biomedical science. In this study, the optimal concentration of bioglass/carbon nanotubes (BG/CNTs) in a composite powder was investigated. The composite was produced using the sol-gel process. When CNTs were added, they provided a crystal nucleation site for BG nanoparticles and decreased the heat treatment temperature required (from 700 degrees C to 500 degrees C). Compared to the BG group, a suitable quantity of CNTs increased the pore size (12.67 nm) of the composite materials. Meanwhile, the BG/0.05 CNT group showed weight gain results and revealed a faster apatite formation rate after 3 days than other composites. The apatite layer (which increased in thickness from 1.69 mu m to 12.51 mu m) was observed using scanning electron microscopy after 7 days. Additionally, the proliferation of the MG63 cell line showed an excellent performance with some BG/CNT ratios. It should be noted, however, that an excessive number (>0.05 wt%) of CNTs as filler in a BG matrix reduces cell growth. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB La-doped Ba0.67Sr0.33TiO3 environmental ceramics were prepared using a solid method. The crystal structure was investigated with XRD and Raman spectroscopy. The results showed that La doping did not change the BST crystal structure. The electrical properties current-voltage (I-V) showed that proper La doping improve the semi-conductivity of the BST ceramics. They are insulators at other La concentrations. High levels of carrier electrons seriously disrupt the phonon vibration. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, magnetic stirring was used to assist hydrothermal, and V6O13 was synthesized by controlling different rotational speeds. The research shows that the appropriate rotational speed can promote the crystallization degree of V6O13. When the rotation speed is 1200 r/min, the structure of the sample becomes fibrous, which facilitates the transportation of lithium ions. As the speed increases, the first discharge capacity of the sample increases, and after 100 cycles, the capacity retention rate is also improved. Compared with the sample without speed, the capacity retention rate of the sample of VO-1200 increases by 18.3%. Applying suitable rotation speed during the synthesis of V6O13 is beneficial to improving the electrochemical performance. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Hydrogen permeation tests were electrochemically performed to measure hydrogen diffusion and trapping in EH 36 steel. Permeation transients were measured through charging and decaying cycles, for specimens prestrained to varying degrees (0-20%). With increasing prestrain, the effective hydrogen diffusivity (D-eff) decreased, while the total/reversible hydrogen content (C-o and C-r, respectively) increased. The immobile dislocation of the 20%-prestrained specimens decreased D-eff by approximately ten times and increased C-o and C-r by approximately three times. The amount of irreversibly trapped hydrogen (C-irr) remained approximately the same, regardless of the prestrain. The dislocations delay the motion of hydrogen and contain more reversible hydrogen.

AB Copper surfaces, with nanowire, microflower and nanowirejmicroflower hierarchical structures, were fabricated by a simple and convenient one-step approach without any further treatment. Variation of fine structure, composition, surface roughness and wettability on copper surfaces with etching time and etching solution was systemically investigated. Results revealed that with a little difference in etching time, wettability could change a lot, from high hydrophobicity to superhydrophilicity. What's more, the mechanism of difference in wettability of copper surfaces, etched by different concentrations of etching solution, was clarified. Surface composition and morphology were in the wettability of copper surfaces. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We electrodeposited bulk nanocrystalline Fe-Ni alloys with a tensile ductility of 12%-24%. We explored the intrinsic ductility of these alloys, taking into consideration the relationship between the ductility and the orientation index and contents of the grain boundary embrittlement element. Applying multiple regression analysis to our findings and those from the literature we found that the ductility of Fe-Ni alloys can be predicted from their orientation index for the (2 0 0) plane and sulfur content. The analysis of our study points to the potential for intrinsic ductility in nanocrystalline Fe-Ni alloys greater than that of the present highest value of 24%. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Under the light wave irradiation, the stable and highly surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) active silver nanosol (AgNP) was prepared by reduction of AgNO3, using sodium citrate as reducer. Urea reacted with dimethylglyoxime to produce 4,5-dimethyl-2-imidazole ketone that exhibited a strong SEAS peak at 1320 cm(-1) in the as-prepared AgNPs substrate. Under the selected conditions, the increased SEAS intensity Delta I was linear to urea concentration in the range of 8.25-825 nM, with a detection limit of 4.92 nM. Accordingly, a new, simple SEAS quantitative analysis method for trace urea in foods was established, with relative standard deviation of 0.92-4.8% and recovery of 97.4-101%.

AB In this paper, starch pastes in the form of solutions and gels were investigated to determine viscoelastic properties and sol-gel phase transition temperatures using rheological methods. The gelatinization process was carried out at a temperature of 95 degrees C with the use of a pressureless starch cell with a stirrer. Starch pastes obtained were used to determine rheological properties under isothermal conditions (in the temperature range of 45-25 degrees C) by a cone-plate measurement system. The viscoelastic behavior of the tested medium was confirmed. The range of gelation temperatures was determined and the influence of several factors was discussed, e.g. the effect of sucrose addition and cooling rate on the phenomenon of sol-gel phase transition. In addition, mechanical properties of the obtained starch gel structures were determined using a fractional rheological model.

AB Pulsed light is a non-thermal technology capable to inactivate enzymes. This study investigated the effect of pulsed light on the activity of polygalacturonase, and on the structure of the enzyme by means of fluorescence emission spectra, free sulphydryl detection and analysis of changes in parameter A and phase-diagram. The results showed that pulsed light is able to inactivate polygalacturonase in buffer, with > 90% reduction of enzyme activity after applying 128 J/cm(2) and a first-order kinetic constant of 0.0426 cm(2)/J under the experimental conditions. The free sulfhydryl detection revealed the rupture of sulfhydryl bridges. Fluorescence spectra analysis showed that the tertiary structure of polygalacturonase was changed. Phase diagram analysis shows the existence of only two populated states. It is suggested that the inactivation of polygalacturonase by pulsed light is an all-or-none process where disulfide bridges are broken and the enzyme is unfolded.

AB The study was aimed at investigating the effect of radio frequency (RF) heating at different temperatures on the protein profile and functional properties of maize grains. Maize grains with 14% moisture content exposed to the radio frequency energy at 300 W for different temperatures 50, 55 and 60 degrees C, respectively. The results indicated that radio frequency heating had no effect on the protein profile of maize. The molecular weight distribution of protein remained in the range of 20-25 kDa after RF heating. On the other hand, the functional properties in term of oil holding capacity and emulsifying properties of maize were improved after RF heating. According to these finding, it can be concluded that radio frequency heating improves the functional properties of maize flour. Thus, RF may provide a potential as an effective emerging technology for improving the quality characteristics of maize grains.

AB This study focused on evaluating the feasibility of using damaged cassava starch (DCS) to exploit staple foods. Cassava starch was subjected to damage induced by mechanical activation to obtain DCS with various degrees of damage. The increase in damage level of cassava starch led to a slight increase in amylose content and reduction in crystallinity. Damage level exerted a major influence on the pasting properties and interaction between DCS and water. SEM analysis showed that DCS tended to cohere together to form a unique dough structure in the presence of water when damage level was not less than 11.51%. Texture properties of the starch dough with damage levels of 11.51% and 15.37% were similar with those of wheat flour dough. Cracker made of DCS had acceptable sensory qualifies comparable to the wheat flour counterpart. These findings confirmed that using DCS for the development of staple foods by the starch dough was practicable.

AB A novel way to fully utilize rambutan fruit and seed is to ferment peeled fruits followed by drying and roasting, and use the seeds to produce seed powder similar to that of cocoa powder. Hence, the objective of this study was to optimize the roasting time and temperature of rambutan fruit post-fermentation and drying, and to produce a cocoa-like powder product from the seeds. Parameters monitored during roasting were colour and total phenolic content, while seed powder obtained using optimized roasting conditions was analyzed for its physicochemical properties and toxicity. The latter was examined using the brine shrimp lethality assay. Results showed that the roasted seed powder possessed colour and key volatile compounds similar to that of cocoa powder. Besides, the brine shrimp lethality assay indicated that the roasted seed powder was non-toxic. Thus, the fruit, including its seed could be fully utilized and subsequently, wastage could be reduced.

AB In the present work it was analyzed the water mobility by characterizing the thermo-gravimetric analysis of the cookie dough with the incorporation of dietary fibers. The fibers analyzed were: inulin (IN), oat fiber (OF), high amylose maize starch (RSII) and phosphate distarch-phosphate (RSIV). Four tests were performed: thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA), pasting profile analysis using water and a solution of 50% sucrose as a solvent, and the study of the ultrastructure of the flour and fiber by SEM and particle size distribution. Changes in the thermo-gravimetric profile were explained by the pasting profile of composites and the ultrastructure of the wheat flour and fibers. OF and IN incorporation changed substantially dough water loss profile and rate. The addition of fibers produced a decrease in the starch pasting profile and inulin showed the highest reduction since less water was available for the hydration of wheat flour starch granules.
