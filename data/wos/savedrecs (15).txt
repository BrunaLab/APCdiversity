ID ENDOVASCULAR TREATMENT; UNRUPTURED ANEURYSMS; GIANT; OCCLUSION; DEFICITS
AB BACKGROUND: Complications after coiling of large, giant, and thrombosed aneurysms because of increased mass effect on surrounding structures have been widely reported. A case of bilateral blindness after incomplete coil embolization of a small anterior cerebral artery aneurysm is rare. We review the potential mechanisms, clinical progression, and proper treatment needs.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 50-year-old man was urgently admitted with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) showed a ruptured aneurysm of the A1 segment, anterior cerebral artery. An endovascular coil occlusion was performed without an additional device. The visual acuity of patient slowly decreased from the 13th day after endovascular intervention. His visual acuity improved after steroid therapy but then deteriorated again. DSA showed an enlarged aneurysm, and an urgent craniotomy was performed for optic nerve decompression. The patient finally became bilaterally blind, although hyperbaric oxygen, neurotrophy drugs, and other supporting treatment was given.
   CONCLUSIONS: Incomplete aneurysm coiling may result in bilateral blindness, even at a small anterior cerebral artery. Early DSA, steroid therapy, and secondary craniotomy for nerve decompression should be considered promptly for improving clinical outcome before nerve atrophy, although sometimes single steroid therapy is effective.

TI Which Patients with Aneurysms Involving the a1-a2 Segment of the
   Anterior Inferior Cerebellar Artery Would Benefit from Parent Artery
   Occlusion?

ID ENDOVASCULAR TREATMENT; CLINICAL PRESENTATION; EMBOLIZATION;
   NOMENCLATURE
AB Anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) trunk aneurysms are rare entities. Given the eloquence of the AICA in supplying the cerebellum and brainstem, in theory, sacrifice or occlusion of the a1-a2 segment in lesions involving the AICA may lead to various complications. However, some patients might experience no complication or favorable recovery. The subgroup of patients who would benefit from parent artery occlusion (PAO) among those with aneurysms involving the a1-a2 segment of the AICA remains to be explored. In this report, we present 2 cases of AICA dissecting aneurysms at the a1-a2 segment that were successfully occluded via coiling without postprocedural complications. A comprehensive literature review was also performed on patients with AICA aneurysms with occlusion at the a1-a2 segment. Sixteen patients were identified, and all of the cases had satisfactory outcomes. Of these patients, 11 of 16 (68.75%) had no neurologic deficits, and 5 of 16 (31.25%) had acceptable neurologic deficits. The prognosis was associated with collateral circulation of the AICA, and collateral circulation was discussed. In case of an a1-a2 aneurysm that is hard to occlude without sacrificing the parent artery, careful hemodynamic and morphologic evaluation for collateral flow is warranted. If collateral flow is demonstrated or the aneurysm is flow-related with cerebellar arteriovenous malformation, PAO of the a1-a2 segment can be an acceptable option.

DE Arachnoid cyst; Neck stiffness; Nuchal rigidity; Uncal herniation
ID TONSILLAR HERNIATION; SYRINGOMYELIA
AB BACKGROUND: Stiff neck or nuchal rigidity is a significant clinical sign of neurologic disease. It is commonly associated with meningitis, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and posterior fossa tumors. It may also occur as a result of tonsillar impaction following pressure in the infratentorial compartment from an expanding posterior fossa mass. It is, however, not commonly known to be associated with uncal herniation.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a recent experience on this association.
   CONCLUSIONS: In the presence of stiff neck or nuchal rigidity in a patient with clinical signs of uncal herniation from a temporal arachnoid cyst, this unusual association could possibly be owing to the effect of increased pressure in the posterior fossa from massive shift of brain tissue posteriorly following a rapid rise in middle cranial fossa pressure consequent on an acute enlargement of the cyst. A false impression of acute meningeal irritation in such a situation could be quite misleading, resulting in late diagnosis and subsequently a delay in timely intervention.

TI African Contribution to the World Neurosurgical Literature During the

LA English
DT Review
DE Africa; Bibliometrics; Medical publication; Neurosurgery; PubMed;
   Research; Scientific productivity
ID TRENDS
AB BACKGROUND: To the best of our knowledge, no previous study has assessed the neurosurgical publications from Africa. A bibliometric analysis was performed in the present study to evaluate the contribution of African authors in neurosurgical journals worldwide and to discuss the approaches that could be used to enhance the quantity and quality of publications on this issue.
   METHODS: A literature search of neurosurgical publications by African investigators was performed using the PubMed database from 1999 to 2018. The total number of articles per country was tabulated and normalized by the number of neurosurgeons in each country.
   RESULTS: A total of 974 articles reported from 1999 to 2018 from 31 African countries were identified and analyzed. The number of African neurosurgical publications have increased remarkably during the past decade. However, a wide disparity exists in the productivity among the countries, especially when normalized by the number of neurosurgeons. Most of the research publications have been case series and case reports, with very few clinical trials, meta-analyses, or international collaborations. According to the neurosurgical research areas, the most representative subspecialties were the spine, intracranial tumor, hydrocephalus, and head injury.
   CONCLUSIONS: African neurosurgeons will be able to meet the challenges of the new century with the appropriate use of its resources and staff, regardless of the difficulties they face. However, African neurosurgical research could be improved by teaching research methods and medical writing and should focus more on modern neurosurgical topics by highlighting continental particularities. African neurosurgeons should collaborate with each other (locally, regionally, and abroad) and with foreign centers for better quality research and international visibility.

AB BACKGROUND: Perioperative cerebral infarction is a potential complication of glioma resection, of which insular tumors are at higher risk because of the proximity of middle cerebral artery branches, including the lateral lenticulostriates and long insular arteries. In this study, 3 patients received three-dimensional rotational angiography, which was fused with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for frameless stereotactic navigation during dominant-hemisphere insular glioma resection.
   METHODS: All patients obtained a preoperative catheter angiogram with a three-dimensional rotational acquisition of the ipsilateral internal carotid artery. The pixel-based axial three-dimensional angiography data, thin-cut structural MRI, tractography from diffusion tensor imaging, and expressive language activation from functional MRI were uploaded into the iPlan software (Brainlab, Heimstetten, Germany) and fused. The target tumor, regional blood vessels, adjacent functional areas, and their associated fiber tracts were segmented and overlaid on the appropriate MRI sequence. This image fusion was used preoperatively to visualize the relationship of the mass with the adjacent vasculature and intraoperatively for frameless stereotactic navigation to optimize preservation of arterial structures.
   RESULTS: Three patients aged 27-60 years with excellent baseline functional status presented with seizures and were found to have a large dominant-hemisphere T2 hyperintense nonenhancing insular mass. Surgical resection was performed using multimodality neuronavigation. None sustained a postoperative arterial infarction or a perioperative neurologic deficit.
   CONCLUSIONS: Neuronavigation using a fusion of three-dimensional rotational angiography with MRI is a technique that can be used for preoperative planning and during resection of insular gliomas to optimize preservation of adjacent arteries.

DT Article
DE Cushing disease; Double pituitary adenoma; Functional adenoma;
   Prolactinoma
AB BACKGROUND: When distinct pituitary hypersecretory manifestations coexist, the differential diagnosis includes plurihormonal or double pituitary adenomas. We describe a rare case of hypercortisolemia and hyperprolactinemia caused by 2 noncontiguous adenomas that required 2 surgeries.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 37-year-old woman presented with 6 months of weight gain, amenorrhea, joint pain, leg swelling, and skin changes. She received prednisone for possible systemic lupus erythematosus. Four months later, she presented with headaches and new-onset diabetes with glucose >1000 mg/dL. Work-up revealed a right-sided 1.1-cm pituitary adenoma and prolactin level of 152.9 ng/mL (normal: 3-27 ng/mL). She was advised to stop the prednisone, start bromocriptine, and see a pituitary specialist. Examination revealed centripetal obesity, supraclavicular and dorsocervical fat pads, violaceous wide striae, bilateral leg edema, and galactorrhea. Workup confirmed adrenocorticotrophic hormone-dependent Cushing syndrome, with a central-to-peripheral gradient on inferior petrosal sinus sampling bilaterally. Transsphenoidal adenenomectomy yielded an adenoma diffusely positive for prolactin. Postoperatively prolactin normalized, hypercortisolemia persisted, and magnetic resonance imaging findings raised suspicion for a 2-mm microadenoma. The patient underwent a second operation when an adrenocorticotrophic hormone-positive adenoma was identified. After 4 years, both hypersecretory syndromes remain in biochemical remission.
   CONCLUSIONS: A complete clinical and biochemical evaluation is necessary in patients with pituitary adenomas. Repeat surgery may be necessary for noncontiguous double adenomas.

   Vascular anomaly
ID PTEN HAMARTOMA; ARTERIOVENOUS-MALFORMATION; DISEASE; FISTULA
AB BACKGROUND: Cowden syndrome is characterized by multiple hamartomas and accompanied by a germline mutation of the phosphatase and tensin homolog gene. Cowden syndrome has been described to be associated with vascular anomalies such as arteriovenous malformation and developmental venous anomalies with high frequency. However, the association of cerebral aneurysms with this syndrome has not been reported yet.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 39-year-old Japanese man presented with a subarachnoid hemorrhage due to a ruptured giant fusiform middle cerebral artery aneurysm. We diagnosed him with Cowden syndrome by clinical presentations as outlined in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network's criteria. As the ruptured fusiform aneurysm involved a middle cerebral artery bifurcation, we prepared for extracranial-intracranial bypass surgery. We successfully performed a surgical clipping using multiple tandem clipping techniques and suction decompression techniques. Bypass surgery was not performed as reconstruction of the M2 trunks was successfully completed.
   CONCLUSIONS: We present this rare case that potentially indicates an association between cerebral aneurysms and Cowden syndrome. Because vascular anomalies are not included in the diagnostic criteria for Cowden syndrome, intracranial vascular anomalies may be underestimated. We therefore recommended a careful search of vascular diseases, including cerebral aneurysms, in cases of Cowden syndrome.

ID TRANSIENT CORTICAL BLINDNESS; BLOOD-BRAIN-BARRIER; COIL EMBOLIZATION;
   ENCEPHALOPATHY
AB BACKGROUND: Contrast-induced encephalopathy (CIE) is a rare and misdiagnosed complication of intravascular injection of contrast, responsible for arterial vasospasm and neurologic effects. Conventional radiologic findings are not in themselves specific for cerebral vasospasm diagnosis. We present a case in which arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was useful in early diagnosis of CIE.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 56-year-old woman was admitted for elective flow-diverter embolization of a recanalized left supra-ophthalmic internal carotid artery aneurysm; at 4 hours postprocedure, she acutely developed sensitive aphasia and right arm paresis. Although no-contrast computed tomography and MRI with fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and diffusion-weighted imaging sequences did not demonstrate acute ischemic/hemorrhagic cerebral foci or cortical edema, ASL showed decreased cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the insular-temporal-parietal anterior lobe, suspected for hypoperfusion due to vasospasm, which was not confirmed by subsequent emergent digital subtraction angiography. At 16 hours, because of worsening symptoms, patient underwent an additional MRI, which showed slight insular cortical edema on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and corresponding slight restricted diffusion-weighted imaging with a severe reduction in CBF value; at this time, emergent digital subtraction angiography demonstrated distal arterial vasospasm of left middle cerebral artery, and vasospasm therapy was started. Within 48 hours of symptom onset, the patient gradually improved to a complete neurologic recovery, with normalization of CBF values in the concerning cerebral region.
   CONCLUSIONS: CIE should always be considered in patients with focal neurologic deficits after iodinate contrast exposure. ASL perfusion MRI with CBF maps could be a promising tool for prompt, early confirmation of underlying vasospasm, as cortical edema and distal vasospasm could not be detected on conventional radiologic imaging.

LA English
DT Review
DE Brown-Sequard syndrome; Duplication of dura; Idiopathic spinal cord
   herniation; ISCH; Ventral dural defect; Ventral herniation of spinal
   cord
ID REPAIR
AB BACKGROUND: Idiopathic spinal cord herniation (ISCH) is a treatable spinal disease. It is rare and often misdiagnosed, causing a delay in management. The etiology is multifactorial, with one of the causes being duplication of the ventral dura. The spinal cord herniates within this defect and becomes strangulated, causing neurological deficits. We report the duplication of a ventral spinal cord as an important cause of ISCH in our review.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present 2 cases of ISCH with duplication of the dura, including their relevant clinical and imaging features. The patients underwent surgical reduction of the herniated spinal cord with enlargement of the defect and placement of a dural substitute ventral to the cord. We have also reported the outcomes of the 2 patients, with an emphasis on the factors predictive of poor outcomes (i.e., long-standing symptoms, a delay in intervention, poor neurological status at presentation, and a thinned out atrophic spinal cord found during surgery). We also reviewed the available data for duplication of the dura with ISCH.
   CONCLUSIONS: Very few asymptomatic patients can be treated conservatively. The surgical outcomes have been favorable for symptomatic patients. Proper exposure, gentle manipulation while reducing the herniated spinal cord, enlargement of the defect, and the use of intraoperative monitoring will help limit the postoperative deficits. Duplication of the ventral dura is an important cause of ISCH. It prevents the formation of an anterior pseudomeningocele after surgery. Owing to the rarity of the disease and the lack of follow-up data with recurrence rates, it has not been possible to form clear guidelines for management.

AB BACKGROUND: Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome (KTWS) is a rare syndrome characterized by the triad of cutaneous hemangiomas, venous varicosities, and osseous-soft tissue hypertrophy of the affected limb. Clinical manifestations, genetic testing, and radiologic imaging are the key steps in diagnosing this syndrome.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: An 18-month-old boy was brought for follow-up brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with a history of right lower limb hypertrophy, cutaneous varicosities, and hemangiomas diagnosed at birth. A baseline MRI at 12 months revealed multiple hemorrhagic lesions within the cerebrum, the largest in the right temporal lobe, which was treated surgically at the age of 18 months because of its rapid growth. This is the youngest patient with KTWS treated surgically for intracranial hemangiomas.
   CONCLUSION: KTWS is a rare disease with a wide range of manifestations. Multisystemic evaluation of this group of patients should be performed to identify cavernous hemangiomas at the early stage of life and adequately treat them in the future. Treatment of KTWS patients with cavernous hemangiomas should not be different from the treatment of patients with any other hemangiomas, and surgical intervention should be considered on a case-to-case bases.

AB BACKGROUND: Visuospatial features of neuroanatomy are likely the most difficult concepts to learn in anatomy. Three-dimensional (3D) modalities have gradually begun to supplement traditional 2-dimensionanl representations of dissections and illustrations. We have introduced and described the workflow of 2 innovative methods-photogrammetry (PGM) and structured light scanning (SLS)which have typically been used for reverse-engineering applications. In the present study, we have described a novel application of SLS and PGM that could enhance medical education and operative planning in neurosurgery.
   METHODS: We have described the workflow of SLS and PGM for creating volumetric models (VMs) of neuroanatomical dissections, including the requisite equipment and software. We have also provided step-by-step procedures on how users can postprocess and refine these images according to their specifications. Finally, we applied both methods to 3 dissected hemispheres to demonstrate the quality of the VMs and their applications.
   RESULTS: Both methods yielded VMs with suitable clarity and structural integrity for anatomical education, surgical illustration, and procedural simulation.
   CONCLUSIONS: The application of 3D computer graphics to neurosurgical applications has shown great promise. SLS and PGM can facilitate the construction of VMs with high accuracy and quality that can be used and shared in a variety of 3D platforms. Similarly, the technical demands are not high; thus, it is plausible that neurosurgeons could become quickly proficient and enlist their use in education and surgical planning. Although SLS is preferable in settings in which high accuracy is required, PGM is a viable alternative with a short learning curve.

ID LOW-GRADE ASTROCYTOMA; SURGICAL-MANAGEMENT; CHILDREN; TUMORS
AB BACKGROUND: Intramedullary glial neoplasms affecting the entire spinal cord from the cervicomedullary junction to conus medullaris are termed holocord tumors. Pilocytic astrocytomas are relatively uncommon tumors forming holocord involvement. Hitherto 24 holocord astrocytoma cases were reported in the literature. Here, a case of an adult holocord pilocytic astrocytoma was presented.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 29-year-old female patient presented with a subtotal resection. Histopathologic examination revealed pilocytic astrocytoma, World Health Organization grade 1, presenting holocord involvement. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a mass containing necrotic and cystic foci leading to an expansion along the entire spinal cord extending from C4 to conus medullaris.
   CONCLUSIONS: Reported holocord pilocytic astrocytomas in the relevant literature cases were reviewed. When evaluating magnetic resonance imaging scans of adult patients with various neurologic symptoms, i.e., weakness and fecal and urinary incontinence, pilocytic astrocytoma should be considered among differential diagnoses of intramedullary mass lesions.

AB Levodopa has long been the standard of care for Parkinson disease (PD); however, the eventual onset of motor fluctuations and levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) complicates its utility in advanced PD. Current neurosurgical interventions remain some of the best options for LID. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is currently the procedure of choice for patients with advanced PD, patients refractory to medical management, and patients with motor complications from levodopa therapy.
   Significant progress has been achieved in recent years, however, as newer techniques are making their way through preclinical and clinical studies. Use of interventional magnetic resonance imaging (iMRI) and a skull-mounted aiming device to guide electrode placement has improved accuracy in recent DBS studies. Adaptive "closed-loop" DBS represents another exciting advancement in the field, in which real-time feedback allows dynamic modulation of the stimulation delivered to the basal ganglia. Magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) is a novel approach to creating precise lesioning in the brain that has shown promising results in preliminary studies for various movement disorders, including dyskinesias, and may transform the neuroablation field. Transcranial magnetic stimulation, which can induce local and distant effects in cortical and subcortical areas, has shown efficacy in managing certain PD and LID symptoms in early studies. Finally, direct stimulation of the motor cortex and the cerebellum has shown therapeutic effects in PD and LID patients in certain studies. Taken together, many of these new techniques have shown great promise in early studies and may eventually be preferred treatment options for LID patients.

ID LUMBOSACRAL SPINE; FUSION
AB BACKGROUND: Controversy exists regarding surgical treatment of high-grade spondylolisthesis (HGS) in terms of decompression with surgical reduction or in situ fusion. In situ fusion has the advantage of being less technically demanding. However, the residual bone graft area is extremely limited, and posterolateral bone grafting is complex as the transverse process of the slipped vertebrae is located anterior to the sacral ala, which correlates with high rates of pseudoarthrosis.
   METHODS: Four cases of L5/S1 HGS complaining of low back pain were treated using our new bone graft technique with an exposed osseous end plate. Transdiskal screw holes were made from the S1 pedicle, and bone chips were packed into the L5/S disk space through the screw holes. The slipped L5 vertebra was fixed with a combination of L5/S1 transdiskal and L5 pedicle screws.
   RESULTS: All cases exhibited good bony fusion, and the low back pain disappeared in all patients up to the 12-month follow-up. This technique involved packing the bone into the closed space, relieving any concerns regarding bone graft migration.
   CONCLUSIONS: Transpedicular bone graft via transdiskal screw holes is an easy and practical technique for raising the fusion rate in surgical treatment of HGS.

AB BACKGROUND: Determining the expression profile and target genes of microRNA (miRNA) would assist in determining the pathophysiologic pathways in intervertebral disk degeneration (IDD). The aim of this study was to determine the expression profile of miRNA in degenerated intervertebral disks compared with normal healthy intervertebral disks.
   METHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis of 3 available miRNA expression datasets to identify a panel of co-deregulated miRNA genes and overlapping biological processes in IDD. Degenerated intervertebral disks were compared with normal healthy disks. We selected 35 miRNA features common to all 3 platforms. Then, we calculated differential expression P values from our unpaired data using metaMA package in R statistical software according to the moderated t test method (Limma). Based on the P values (where the threshold was <0.05), a list of differentially expressed miRNAs was identified.
   RESULTS: After normalization and selection of common miRNA features across all 3 platforms, we found a total of 5 differentially expressed miRNAs, among which miR-574-3p, miR-199a-5p, and miR-483-5p were not identified in any individual studies. Our results revealed that miR-199a-5p, miR-574-3p, miR-551a, and miR-640 are commonly upregulated in IDDs compared with control disks, whereas miR-483 is commonly downregulated. Pathway analysis of identified dysregulated miRNAs indicated the involvement of extracellular matrix-receptor interaction, adherens junction, and transforming growth factor-beta signaling pathway in the pathogenesis of IDDs. Moreover, the network of predicted targets for these miRNAs identified most affected target genes as ERBB4 and CLTC.
   CONCLUSIONS: We found that the identified miRNAs through meta-analysis are candidate predictive markers for IDDs through different pathways.

AB These video cases present some unique technical tenets for microsurgical clipping of proximal internal carotid artery aneurysms (Video 1). The first patient is a 49-year-old woman with a history of a prior ruptured and treated right middle cerebral artery aneurysm who was found to have growth of known left middle cerebral artery and left internal carotid artery ophthalmic segment aneurysms on radiographic studies. An intradural clinoidectomy with Sonopet, with proximal control at cervical carotid and wide sylvian fissure exposure with ample sharp dissection of the aneurysm anatomy, allowed safe clipping of the ophthalmic aneurysm in this case. The second patient is a 39-year-old woman with a history of a prior left middle cerebral artery M2 occlusion with recent mechanical thrombectomy. The patient was found to have a 6-mm incidental, unruptured right internal cerebral artery paraophthalmic segment and 3-mm right posterior communicating artery aneurysm on radiographic studies. This patient underwent microsurgical clipping given unique patient factors. A similar controlled intradural clinoidectomy, with proximal cervical ICA control and aneurysmal segment trapping, allowed safe aneurysm exclusion. For patients with multiple aneurysms such as in these cases, the deeper proximal aneurysm should generally be treated first. The videos illustrate some key technical points in this regard.

   appearance
ID SKULL BASE; SUPRASELLAR
AB BACKGROUND: Paraganglioma in cavernous sinus is a rare entity often misdiagnosed as meningioma or schwannoma on radiology. The embryological origin, from cells of neural crest, does not explain the location per se. Because of its highly vascular nature and close proximity to the carotid artery, surgical excision is a challenge. We herein report the first case of cavernous sinus paraganglioma, without the characteristic "salt and pepper appearance," excised near completely by the subtemporal approach.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 30-year-old woman without a history of any comorbid conditions, particularly hypertension, presented with a 6-month history of progressive headache and double vision. She exhibited upward gaze palsy and hypoesthesia over the right half of her face. There was no papilledema and proptosis. Radiologic imaging revealed an extra-axial T1-weighted isointense, T2-weighted hyperintense lesion with homogenous intense contrast uptake in right parasellar region encasing cavernous internal carotid artery. Furthermore, the tumor was extending along the superior orbital fissure. Suspecting a cavernous sinus meningioma, we performed near-total excision via a subtemporal approach. Postoperative recovery was uneventful, and patient was discharged on fifth postoperative day. The histopathology and immunohistochemistry were consistent with paraganglioma. The patient underwent adjuvant radiotherapy and is under our outpatient follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: Paraganglioma must be considered in the differential diagnosis of parasellar tumors, even when secretory symptoms are absent. The radiologic findings are obscure, and it is difficult to differentiate it from more common tumors of this region such as meningioma, schwannoma, and pituitary adenoma. Surgical excision followed by radiotherapy is the mainstay of management.

TI Serial Quantitative and Qualitative Measurements of Flow in Vein of
   Galen Malformations Using 4-Dimensional Flow Magnetic Resonance Imaging
   (Phase Contrast Vastly undersampled Isotropic PRojection)
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Cerebral blood flow; Interventional; Novel imaging sequence; Phase
   contrast imaging; Vein of Galen malformation
AB BACKGROUND: Vein of Galen malformations (VoGMs) induce cerebrovascular dysfunction through arterial steal and venous hypertension resulting, if untreated, in severe neurologic morbidity and mortality. Noninvasive techniques for quantitative, serial evaluation of cerebrovascular hemodynamics in VoGMs are lacking. This proof of concept study using quantitative blood flow measurements from 4-dimensional flow magnetic resonance imaging may be useful as a noninvasive biomarker to guide timing of intervention and assess disease progression and treatment outcomes.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Between July 2016 and July 2018, 4 patients harboring VoGMs underwent Phase Contrast Vastly undersampled Isotropic PRojection (PCVIPR) imaging at the University of Wisconsin Hospitals and Clinics. We applied PCVIPR imaging to assess its potential for obtaining anatomic and physiologic flow data before and after surgical embolization of VoGMs. Hemodynamic pressure parameters obtained from PCVIPR imaging were compared with stump pressures recorded in vivo. We found a decrease in mean arterial pressure from 97 mm Hg pretreatment to 65 mm Hg post treatment. These findings corroborate the decrement in venous pressure gradients documented on PCVIPR imaging. For all patients, pressure gradient changes on PCVIPR imaging correlated with in vivo arterial pressures and aided in clinical decision related to cerebrovascular evaluation, treatment planning, and clinical course.
   CONCLUSIONS: Four-dimensional flow magnetic resonance imaging/PCVIPR imaging has a potential role in determining endovascular embolization and therapeutic outcomes on the basis of objective and reproducible hemodynamic characteristics of the vascular lesion. It represents a novel, noninvasive approach that may guide the extent and timing of therapeutic intervention and treatment of cerebrovascular diseases in pediatric patients.

   Posterior fossa; Posterior meningeal artery; Supracerebellar approach
AB Dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs) represent 10%-15% of all intracranial arteriovenous malformations.(1) DAVFs located in the posterior cranial fossa are rare and often present with intracranial hemorrhage and myelopathy.(2) Arterial supply could be provided by the meningeal branches of the vertebral artery and external and internal carotid arteries.(3)
   A 68-year-old man presented with progressive lower-extremity weakness (Video 1). Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a patchy longitudinal cord signal abnormality extending from the cervicomedullary junction to C7. A tentorial DAVF supplied by the right posterior meningeal artery with drainage via dorsal and ventral perimedullary veins was identified on angiography. According to the Cognard classification, the patient's DAVF was determined to be high risk as a type V lesion with spinal venous drainage and progressive myelopathy.(4) The fistula was embolized with 50% ethanol resulting in near-complete occlusion. However, follow-up angiography revealed a persistent arteriovenous shunt and slightly worsening symptoms for the patient. He underwent a sitting supracerebellar approach with a torcular craniotomy for successful clip ligation of the dural arteriovenous fistula. The patient was discharged with improvements in lower-extremity strength and no residual arteriovenous shunting in postoperative imaging.

DT Article
DE Laparoscopic; Lateral femoral cutaneous nerve; Meralgia paresthetica;

ID DIAGNOSIS; INJURY
AB BACKGROUND: Meralgia paresthetica, a pain syndrome that is caused by injury to the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve, is a well-documented complication after anterior hip arthroplasty (THA). Traditional treatment of this peripheral nerve entrapment syndrome can be complicated in patients who have had THA via an anterior approach owing to the presence of scar in the postoperative bed.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: In a 70-year-old man, we performed a novel laparoscopic-assisted intra-abdominal approach to treat meralgia paresthetica in the setting of previous anterior THA.
   CONCLUSIONS: Minimally invasive intra-abdominal treatment of meralgia paresthetica following anterior THA results in durable pain relief. This approach is a helpful alternative to traditional techniques of decompression or section of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve below the inguinal ligament.

SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Discitis; Endoscope; Hybrid surgery; Robotics; Technology; Thoracic
   spine
AB BACKGROUND: Emerging technologies in minimally invasive spinal surgery include surgical robots for navigation and spinal endoscopy. We applied these technologies in concert to treat a critically ill patient with thoracic discitis.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: The patient was an 83-year old woman with extensive medical comorbidities. In 2016, she was admitted from her skilled nursing facility with chest pain radiating to her left arm. Following a negative cardiac workup, computed tomography imaging revealed a right paramediastinal thoracic collection with endplate erosion at the T4 and T5 levels. Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging was consistent with spondylodiscitis. We developed a preoperative trajectory with targeting software to the target levels. Following positioning and calibration in the operating room, we used the robot to establish our planned trajectory along the T4-T5 transpedicular route on the left side. We established a working channel and docked the endoscope through the T4-T5 annulus. Frank pus extruded on entering the disc, which we immediately sampled and sent for culture. We next advanced the endoscope into the disc space, allowing us to clean the endplates with microcurettes and copious irrigation. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to the intensive care unit in light of her general medical status. She recovered well and was discharged from our hospital on postoperative day 11 after a course of intravenous antibiotics.
   CONCLUSIONS: This case represents a novel endoscopic-robotic hybrid spine surgery that we believe will find further applications in spinal surgery.

TI Multimodal Management of Aggressive Recurrent Aneurysmal Bone Cyst of

DT Review
DE Aneurysmal bone cyst; Hydroxyapatite; Multimodal management;
   Personalized medicine; Sclerotherapy; Spinal cord compression; Spine
ID COMPRESSION; SUBSTITUTE
AB BACKGROUND: Different treatment options have been proposed for aneurysmal bone cysts (ABCs) with sclerotherapy favored as primary treatment and surgery remaining the mainstay of treatment in case of compression of neural structures. Recurrent spinal ABCs are burdened by increased risk of spinal deformity and instability, further complicating the management of these cases.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 15-year-old boy presented with acute symptoms and signs of spinal cord compression due to a large thoracic ABC. Subtotal resection of the lesion achieved optimal decompression of neural structures with good neurologic recovery, but the remnant of the lesion rapidly grew with recurrent spinal cord compression after 40 days. The patient underwent total surgical resection with full neurologic recovery. Unfortunately, recurrence of the lesion was documented at 3-months' follow-up. This was successfully treated with percutaneous injection of hydroxyapatite cement. Two years' follow-up ruled out any further recurrence of the lesion. Furthermore, spinal deformity and instability were also excluded.
   CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous sclerotherapy with hydroxyapatite cement proved to be highly effective and safe in the treatment of spinal ABC, though surgery remains mandatory in case of spinal cord compression. The main advantage of sclerotherapy with hydroxyapatite cement seems to be the capacity to regenerate bone with normal radiologic features.

DT Review
DE Cavernous malformations; Optic canal; Optic nerve; Visual field deficit
ID MALFORMATIONS; MANAGEMENT; ANGIOMA; RADIOSURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: Cerebral cavernous malformations of the intracanalicular optic nerve are extremely rare lesions. Only a few case reports and 1 case series have been published. We report an additional case with atypical imaging and review the existing literature with attention to time to surgery and imaging characteristics.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: In a 38-year-old man with progressive visual field deficit, a lesion compressing the left optic nerve in the optic canal was diagnosed. On magnetic resonance imaging, this lesion had a homogeneous signal and was tentatively diagnosed as a meningioma. A left frontolateral craniotomy with extradural skull base approach with neuronavigation was performed for resection and definitive diagnosis of the lesion. Pathologic examination showed a lesion most consistent with a cavernous hemangioma. Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging at 6 months showed no remaining tissue or recurrence. Clinically, there was subjective and objective improvement of sight.
   CONCLUSIONS: A cerebral cavernous malformation should always be in the differential diagnosis of a lesion causing an optic neuropathy with visual acuity loss and visual field defect. Clinical presentation of an optic neuropathy requires medical imaging; magnetic resonance imaging is the modality of choice in the diagnosis of these lesions. The treatment of cerebral cavernous malformation is gross total resection.

DE Atlantooccipital synovial cyst; Hypoglossal nerve palsy
ID INTRANEURAL GANGLION CYST; MICROSURGICAL RESECTION; SECONDARY
AB BACKGROUND: Isolated hypoglossal nerve palsy caused by an atlantooccipital synovial cyst is a rare lesion, with fewer than 5 cases reported in the literature.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Our patient presented with acute hypoglossal nerve dysfunction. Our differential included neoplasm, trauma, stroke, multiple sclerosis, or other inflammatory/infectious etiology. Imaging revealed a peripherally enhancing, extradural focus in the left premedullary cistern, most likely consistent with a synovial cyst.
   CONCLUSIONS: A left suboccipital craniectomy was performed in the region of the left hypoglossal canal, in which a cystic structure was noted at the occipital condyle and C1 vertebral junction. The nerve was adequately decompressed via aspiration of the cyst. Postoperatively, the patient substantially improved. Although rare, synovial cysts must be included in the differential diagnosis of atlantooccipital lesions.

AB BACKGROUND: Endoscopic endonasal surgery is a rapidly evolving field that offers the possibility of treating a wide variety of skull base lesions. Reconstruction of the osteodural defect is of utmost importance, as an effective and watertight closure is mandatory. Over the years, various techniques and materials have been adopted in an effort of providing a resilient and reliable method of closure.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data from a series of 25 patients who underwent skull base reconstruction according to a novel paradigm following endoscopic endonasal transtuberculum-transplanum approaches for tumor removal between June 2017 and June 2018. The 3F strategy involves autologous fat grafting, nasoseptal flap coverage, and flash mobilization out of the bed following the operation.
   RESULTS: The 3F technique achieved successful watertight closure in 24 of 25 cases (96%). One case of postoperative cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea developed on postoperative day 10, which did not require reoperation. No perioperative complications related to the 3F strategy (e.g., overpacking, infections, or hematomas) occurred. No donor graft site infections or hematomas developed.
   CONCLUSIONS: The 3F skull base reconstruction is a safe and effective method in achieving watertight closure after extended endoscopic endonasal approaches. Despite this study reporting a preliminary experience in a small series of patients, it seems that the 3F technique can be considered as a viable solution among the wide kaleidoscope of available skull base reconstruction methods.

AB BACKGROUND: Among the posterior techniques, the use of cervical inter-facet spacers (CISs) represents a promising technology whose potentialities are still being studied. The purpose of the present review was to assess the available data on CISs.
   METHODS: A search on PubMed was performed. The search terms were "cervical interfacet spacers," "facet spacers," "DTRAX facet system," "Goel facet spacer," "pseudarthrosis," "cervical lordosis," "iatrogenic kyphosis," "cervical foraminal decompression," "cervical biomechanics," "atlantoaxial instability," and "subaxial instability."
   RESULTS: Mechanical studies have shown that stand-alone CISs promoted stiffness in all directions, except for extension. Foraminal distraction was recorded in 86% of the cases. Clinical studies have shown that the use of CISs could promote successful arthrodesis, given the large surface area affected by fusion and decreasing the need for autografts. The effectiveness for the treatment of radiculopathy has been confirmed by several clinical studies. In a series of 154 levels of implanted CISs, no evidence of significant loss of cervical lordosis was identified. CISs could help in enhancing fusion in C1-C2 fixation.
   CONCLUSIONS: Biomechanical studies on specimens showed a positive trend in increasing stiffness of the cervical spine, despite some controversial results. In clinical studies, facet distraction was shown to be a safe and valid option for clinical indirect decompression, although longer follow-up is required for confirmation. No evidence of the loss of cervical lordosis has been recorded. The long-term effects and CIS use in revision procedures as adjuvant implants to treat pseudarthrosis or atlantoaxial instability are currently under investigation, and further studies are needed.

   Neurosurgery; Pediatrics; SEA; Spinal epidural abscess
ID BACK-PAIN; MANAGEMENT; FEVER
AB BACKGROUND: Spinal epidural abscess (SEA) is a rare but serious infection in the epidural space along the spinal cord. SEA should be considered in patients with backache, fever, neurological deficits and/or spinal tenderness. Early diagnosis is imperative to prevent permanent neurological sequelae.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a case of lumbar SEA in a 13-year-old girl who was immunocompetent and presented with spinal tenderness, back pain and 4 days of fever. A lumbar magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated an epidural abscess from L3-S1. She had emergent surgical intervention. Cultures grew methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus. She was also given long-term systemic antibiotics and she made a complete recovery within 2 months.
   CONCLUSIONS: SEA in an immunocompetent pediatric without risk factors is an extremely rare condition. In the English-language literature, there are only 30 reported cases in the past 19 years; our case brings the total to 31. Non-surgical treatment has been successful in both adult and pediatric patients under certain conditions. Still, there exists a risk of deterioration with non-surgical management, even in patients for whom treatment is begun in the absence of neurologic deficits. Tracking neurological deficits in children can be challenging, particularly in young children who are non-verbal and not yet ambulating, and a reliable neurologic examination is a critical component of non-surgical care. In consideration of these facts and the accelerated time frame of deterioration, once neurologic deficits are present, surgery plus systemic antibiotics remains the standard of care for pediatric SEA patients, with each individual case meriting review of the full clinical picture.

ID THORACOLUMBAR KYPHOSIS; SURGICAL-TREATMENT; STENOSIS
AB BACKGROUND: Achondroplasia, a genetic disorder of bone growth, produces specific clinical features of the extremities and spine. Spinal stenosis, seen in patients with achondroplasia, is a congenital disorder related to premature fusion of the pedicles to the lamina. It can be caused by ossification of the ligamentum flavum, which is rare in patients with achondroplasia.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a rare congenital spinal stenosis with ossification of the ligamentum flavum and thoracolumbar kyphosis deformity in a 24-year-old man with dwarfism and achondroplasia. He was treated with posterior instrumentation and decompression with a wide laminectomy.
   CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of the deformity and the rare condition of ligamentum flavum in a patient with achondroplasia resulted in improved neurologic status and symptoms. To our knowledge, this is the first case report including treatment for both the deformity and thoracic and lumbar ossified ligamentum flavum lesion in a patient with achondroplasia.

LA English
DT Review
DE Antithrombotic therapy; Ischemic stroke; Subarachnoid hemorrhage;
   Thrombosed cerebral aneurysm
ID UNRUPTURED INTRACRANIAL ANEURYSMS; NATURAL-HISTORY; MANAGEMENT
AB BACKGROUND: Thrombosed cerebral aneurysm (TCA) can cause cerebral infarction. However, treatment of cerebral infarction due to embolism from TCA is controversial because of the risk of rupture, and no consensus has been established for the treatment of patients with this condition.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 75-year-old woman suffered left hemiparesis. Computed tomography (CT) showed a high-density round mass in the right sylvian fissure, which was suspected to be a nonruptured TCA. Magnetic resonance (MR) angiography and CT angiography demonstrated an aneurysm in the distal part of the right middle cerebral artery with poor opacification of most of the aneurysm, suggesting partial thrombosis. Diffusion-weighted MR imaging revealed high intensity in the right frontal lobe, in a distribution distal to the aneurysm. The diagnosis was cerebral infarction due to embolism from a partially thrombosed aneurysm. She was treated with antithrombotic therapy. On day 4, she suddenly became comatose. CT and CT angiography revealed subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and enlarged opacification in the aneurysm, respectively. She underwent neck clipping of the aneurysm, but her neurologic improvement was poor. TCA causing ischemic stroke followed by SAH is extremely rare, with only 4 previous reported cases. All patients had received antithrombotic therapies, and most aneurysms had ruptured within a few days after starting antithrombotic therapy. The outcomes were extremely poor.
   CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that antithrombotic therapy might be avoided for these patients. Early surgical treatment without antithrombotic therapy is recommended to prevent aneurysm rupture and recurrent distal embolism from the TCA.

ID SURVIVAL
AB BACKGROUND: Parotid adenocarcinoma comprises 10% of all parotid cancers and does not frequently produce distant metastases. The most common site for metastases is the lung, and there have only been 2 reported cases of skeletal metastases. The purpose of this study is to report the first vertebral metastasis from a primary parotid adenocarcinoma. Patient records, imaging, and pathology from a case of vertebral metastasis of a primary parotid adenocarcinoma were reviewed. A literature review of parotid adenocarcinoma metastases was also performed and is presented.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 53-year-old male with a medical history of parotid adenocarcinoma treated with chemotherapy and radiation presented with back pain. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar region showed a lytic lesion on the left side of the L4 vertebral body, and a biopsy confirmed the lesion was metastatic adenocarcinoma.
   CONCLUSIONS: Distant metastases from a primary parotid adenocarcinoma are rare events, especially metastases to bone. This case represents the first vertebral metastasis from a primary parotid adenocarcinoma.

ID FLOSEAL; HEMORRHAGE; EFFICACY; SAFETY
AB BACKGROUND: Local hemostatic agents have been used in the neurosurgical field for many years; it is safe and efficient with no fatal complication reported in the literature. We routinely used a gelatin-thrombin hemostatic agent (FloSeal Hemostatic Matrix) for hemostasis in minimally invasive endoscopic-assisted surgery for more than 500 patients with intracerebral hemorrhage. However, 2 cases with sterile cyst formation were encountered.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We reported 2 cases with sterile cyst formation after the use of a gelatin-thrombin hemostatic agent. Both of them had intracerebral hemorrhage. One received endoscopic hematoma evacuation, and the other had traditional craniotomy. They all received drainage of the cyst due to progressive enlargement and the mass effect they exert.
   CONCLUSIONS: These sterile cysts were very close to the ventricle wall on images. We hypothesized that cyst wall may be formed not only by hemostatic agent-related fibrosis and inflammation according to the previous literature review but also by the presence of the check valve mechanism between the cyst and the ventricle, which caused further dilation of the cyst.

   Three-dimensional virtual reality simulation; von Hippel-Lindau disease
ID CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; NATURAL-HISTORY
AB BACKGROUND: von Hippel-Lindau disease-related hemangioblastoma is likely to occur in the cerebellum and accompany a cyst. As multiple hemangioblastomas commonly occur in von Hippel-Lindau disease, and multiple surgeries may thus be necessary, a minimally invasive surgical strategy is of great importance.
   METHODS: We present 2 patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease-related hemangioblastomas successfully treated by a fully endoscopic transcranial approach via a short skin incision and a 2 cm x 2 cm small bony window. Before surgery, a three-dimensional virtual reality model was created to determine the ideal trajectory.
   RESULTS: Patient 1 had 2 serial large cystic tumors that equally contributed to obstructive hydrocephalus and were resected sequentially via a single endoscopic trajectory. Patient 2 had a progressive large cystic tumor that was resected endoscopically. Complete resection of the tumors was achieved without any complications in either patient.
   CONCLUSIONS: Small nodular tumors accompanying a large cyst are plausible candidates for endoscopic transcranial surgery. The spatial relationship of nodules, cyst, and cerebellar parenchyma is important to determine the applicability of the present technique. Preoperative three-dimensional virtual reality simulation helps assess the feasibility of this approach.

SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Arteriovenous malformation; Cavernoma; Gamma knife; Hydrocephalus
ID CYST FORMATION; BRAIN EDEMA
AB BACKGROUND: Gamma-Knife radiosurgery can be the treatment of choice for small cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in eloquent brain areas or, in association with endovascular treatment, for large and complex AVMs. Among the possible delayed complications occurring after radiosurgery of AVMs, de novo formation of a cavernoma has only recently been described. The authors report a unique case of communicating hydrocephalus with highly proteinaceous cerebrospinal fluid due to a cavernoma-like lesion of an obliterated cerebral AVM treated by embolization and radiosurgery.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 43-year-old female patient with a left parieto-occipital AVM (Spetzler-Martin grade III) underwent a multimodality treatment comprising several endovascular procedures and Gamma-Knife radiosurgery. At the follow-up angiograms, the AVM was completely obliterated. Twelve years later, she came back to our attention for headache and vomit with the radiological evidence of brain edema, severe hydrocephalus, and a chronic encapsulated intracerebral hematoma. At the beginning, the drainage of hydrocephalus proved ineffective to improve symptoms and edema. Therefore, the surgical resection of both the obliterated AVM and the cavernoma-like lesion-histologically confirmed-was necessary. The hydrocephalus resolved as well as the cerebral edema after 3 weeks, without necessity of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt.
   CONCLUSIONS: In previous neurosurgical literature, the association of a caveroma-like lesion in an obliterated AVM and communicating hydrocephalus with highly proteinaceous cerebrospinal fluid has not yet been discussed. We believe that only the surgical resection of both the obliterated AVM and the cavernoma-like lesion can lead to complete clinical recovery of the hydrocephalus.

ID NERVE
AB BACKGROUND: Cervicogenic headache (CEH) is characterized by unilateral posterior head and neck pain originating from cervical structures and may be improved or resolved by successful treatment of the causative cervical disorder or lesion. Cervical medial branch radiofrequency (RF) lesion therapy is effective in some CEH patients with no significant pathologic abnormalities that can be surgically corrected. However, patients with refractory CEH are often encountered clinically.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Here we describe the case of a 68-year-old female with an 18-year history of CEH who did not respond to a series of treatments including nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, anticonvulsants, medial branch diagnostic block, medial branch RF lesion, and spinal cord stimulation. After careful examination, we performed percutaneous endoscopic right C2-C3 medial branch neurotomy under local anesthesia and neuroleptanalgesia. The patient's constant pain was ultimately relieved.
   CONCLUSIONS: For patients with refractory CEH who failed medial branch RF lesion, which could be relieved briefly by diagnostic medial branch injection, percutaneous endoscopic C2-C3 medial branches neurotomy may alleviate their pain under the premise of full informed consent, accurate localization, careful intraoperative exploration, and stimulation testing.

AB BACKGROUND: Head trauma and neurosurgical-related osteomyelitis are common causes of cranial bone defect. Even though cranioplasty is considered a safe and well-consolidated procedure, there are still some issues about the flap's vascularization assessment. In this paper we describe a 2-staged cranioplasty procedure, focusing on the perioperative evaluation of the skin flap vascularization. Our goal is to assess if the skin flap's perfusion measurement with indocyanine green fluorescence can be considered a reliable method to predict good outcome in cranioplasties.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 50-year-old patient presented with a wide frontal bone defect due to a prior surgery-related osteomyelitis. During the first operation, a tissue expander was placed under the scalp in order to grant an appropriate skin stretching. During the second operation the defect was repaired with a custom-made prosthesis after tissue expander removal. During all procedures, vascular integrity of the skin flap was intraoperatively assessed by means of indocyanine green fluorescence.
   CONCLUSIONS: Surgical procedures were well tolerated; at 1 year of follow-up the cosmetic defect was unremarkable. Indocyanine green fluorescence can be a good aid to predict the probability of the skin flap survival by measuring its perfusion.

AB BACKGROUND: Migratory tumors of the spinal cord are rare and can present as a missing tumor intraoperatively. This can lead to unnecessary abandonment of surgery or unnecessary laminectomies.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a case of migratory intradural extramedullary tumor of the spine, which was missing intraoperatively. The surgery was abandoned, and on reimaging the tumor was found to have migrated. Here we summarize a review of the literature of such cases and the lessons we learned from our experience, emphasizing the measures to prevent tumor displacement and the importance of intraoperative imaging.
   CONCLUSIONS: Migratory schwannoma should be suspected in case of a missing lesion. Intraoperative ultrasonography and myelography use should be definitely considered where facility for intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging is not available. Preventive measures should be taken to avoid tumor migration in all routine cases of intradural extramedullary lesions.

AB BACKGROUND: Despite decades of research, cerebral vasospasm (CV) continues to account for high morbidity and mortality in patients who survive their initial aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
   OBJECTIVE: To define the scope of the problem and review key treatment strategies that have shaped the way CV is managed in the contemporary era.
   METHODS: A literature search was performed of CV management after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
   RESULTS: Recent advances in neuroimaging have led to improved detection of vasospasm, but established treatment guidelines including hemodynamic augmentation and interventional procedures remain highly variable among neurosurgical centers. Experimental research in subarachnoid hemorrhage continues to identify novel targets for therapy.
   CONCLUSIONS: Proactive and preventive strategies such as oral nimodipine and endovascular rescue therapies can reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with CV.

AB BACKGROUND: We present the case of a 51-year-old male with an occult transorbital intracranial injury after a car accident. The identified foreign object was a windshield wiper handle. To our knowledge, this is the first case reported.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Multidisciplinary treatment with maxillofacial and otorhinolaryngology departments was planned. A bifrontal craniotomy with removal of the foreign object and posterior orbital reconstruction were performed. A review of the literature was done, in order to highlight certain general principles in decision making despite the variability in case presentation.
   CONCLUSIONS: Occult TII is a rare subtype of penetrating brain injury. Diagnosis requires high suspicion as it can be missed during physical examination. Computed tomography (CT) scan, CT angiogram, and magnetic resonance imaging should be performed in order to design the optimal treatment for each patient. Magnetic resonance imaging should be avoided when metallic density on CT is observed. The use of a broad-spectrum antibiotic regimen is critical.

AB BACKGROUND: Although intraarterial 3-dimensional digital subtraction angiography (ia-3DDSA) using an angiographic C-arm system is still the gold standard for postoperative confirmation of surgical clipping of intracranial aneurysms, ia-3DDSA requires catheterization and intraarterial injection of contrast medium, which adds risks to the surgical procedure and takes time. We propose a less invasive acquisition of 3D digital subtraction angiography with intravenous injection (iv-3DDSA) in the hybrid operating room to confirm the results of surgical clipping immediately after surgery.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 56-year-old woman was diagnosed with an incidental wide-necked aneurysm located at the distal anterior cerebral artery. We performed surgical clipping. During the surgery, indocyanine green video angiography and Doppler ultrasonography were used for confirmation, and after the surgery iv-3DDSA and ia-3DDSA were performed with the angiography C-arm system in the hybrid operating room while the patient was still under anesthesia. We could confirm that there was no neck remnant left and that the parent vesselswere patent on both iv-3DDSA and ia-3DDSA images. The image quality of iv-3DDSA was sufficient for all treatment evaluations and offered the additional benefits of visualizing the whole angioarchitecture including the contralateral side, being less invasive, and requiring only a few minutes until the availability of images.
   CONCLUSIONS: Iv-3DDSA can be useful for postsurgical confirmation of clipping of aneurysms in the hybrid operating room.

AB BACKGROUND: This report discusses the risks and complications of using the extended endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal approach (EEETA) in a special craniopharyngioma case to caution neurosurgeons. CASE
   DESCRIPTION: A 38-year-old woman with craniopharyngioma underwent EEETA surgery. Her anterior cerebral artery was punctured intraoperatively and clipped using an aneurysm clip through the nose in an emergency procedure.
   CONCLUSIONS: The coexistence of severe calcified craniopharyngiomas, especially with sharp calcified spurs, a narrow distance between the anterior communicating artery and the planum sphenoidale, and a narrow distance between the bilateral internal carotid arteries is a significant warning signal during EEETA for craniopharyngiomas. In this circumstance, it may be preferable to use open microsurgical approaches. If the anterior communicating artery or anterior cerebral artery is punctured during EEETA, another method is available to fix the problem using an aneurysm clip through the nose, and not only endovascular embolization.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate safety and effectiveness of the application of piezosurgery in en bloc laminectomy for the treatment of multilevel thoracic ossification of ligamentum flavum (MTOLF).
   METHODS: Forty-one cases who had MTOLF and underwent en bloc laminectomy from January 2012 to January 2017 were reviewed and divided into Group A (high-speed drill, n = 23) and Group B (piezosurgery, n = 18). Comparisons in clinical outcome and perioperative complications were carried out between the 2 groups.
   RESULTS: Mean follow-up period was comparable between Group A (12.6 months) and Group B (11.4 months). Both operation time and intraoperative blood loss in Group A were significantly more than those in Group B (P < 0). Although final Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score in both groups significantly increased, differences in preoperative JOA, final JOA, and neurologic recovery rate between the 2 groups weren't significant. Perioperative complications included early neurologic deterioration (1 in Group A), wound infection (2 in Group A and 1 in Group B), and leakage of cerebrospinal fluid (5 in Group A and 1 in Group B); incidences of these complications between the 2 groups weren't significant (P > 0.05). A relationship analysis showed that cases with preoperative tram track sign, tuberous OLF, or larger compression ratio were at greater risk of developing an intraoperative dura defect.
   CONCLUSIONS: The application of piezosurgery in en bloc laminectomy is a safe and effective method in the treatment of MTOLF, and it was advantageous for reducing both operation time and intraoperative blood loss compared with the high-speed drill.

DE DAVF; Electrocoagulation; Endovascular; Transarterial; Transvenous
ID IMAGING FINDINGS; CLASSIFICATION; LESION; ONYX
AB BACKGROUND: Dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs) with perimedullary venous drainage are very rare intracranial DAVFs. Treating DAVF via an endovascular electrocoagulation technique, to the best of our knowledge, has not been reported in the literature. We therefore report the first successful case.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a rare case of Cognard type V DAVF. The feeding arteries were the middle meningeal artery, the recurrent meningeal branch of ophthalmic artery, and the meningohypophyseal trunk. The patient presented with paresthesia and weakness in the lower limbs. T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging revealed a high signal in the medulla oblongata and upper cervical spinal cord. Our first procedure via the middle meningeal artery with Onyx 18 (ev3 Neurovascular) as the embolization agent failed to occlude the fistula. We finally occluded the fistula with the endovascular electro-coagulation technique. Two-year follow-up revealed total disappearance of the fistula and relieve of patient's symptoms.
   CONCLUSIONS: The endovascular electrocoagulation technique is very effective in the management of complex DAVFs with perimedullary venous drainage.

ID ARTERY BYPASS; REVASCULARIZATION; SUPERIOR; STROKE; FLOW
AB BACKGROUND: Vertebrobasilar insufficiency (VBI) is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality, especially after failure of first-line medical and/or endovascular therapies. Although the optimal therapeutic strategy for refractory VBI remains unclear, surgical bypass represents a potentially life-saving treatment in this patient subset.
   METHODS: A multi-institution retrospective database review was performed to identify patients with symptomatic refractory VBI over a 4-year period (July 2014 to July 2018). Surgical treatments, as well as clinical and neurologic outcomes were recorded.
   RESULTS: Five patients were identified with refractory VBI (average age 55 +/- 11.0 years). All 5 patients had clinically significant posterior circulation strokes on presentation. Three patients underwent superficial temporal artery-to-superior cerebellar artery bypass based on significant acute perfusion mismatches or progressive strokes despite maximal medical therapy; 1 surgical patient (33%) experienced punctate perioperative strokes and there were no significant bypass related complications. Functional outcomes in the 3 surgical patients were correlated with preoperative stroke burden. The remaining 2 patients experienced rapid neurologic declines after presentation that precluded bypass, and died shortly thereafter.
   CONCLUSIONS: Refractory VBI has high morbidity, with cerebral bypass representing a safe and potentially efficacious treatment for selected patients. Long-term postbypass outcomes are dependent on the level of irreversible preoperative neurologic injuries.

TI Transient Incomplete Locked-In Syndrome Secondary to Supratentorial
   Gunshot Wound
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Cerebral gunshot injury; Locked in syndrome; Neurotrauma
AB BACKGROUND: Locked-in syndrome (LIS) is a rare neurologic disorder characterized as quadriplegia with anarthria. The diagnosis of LIS is challenging and requires a high index of suspicion. The syndrome is typically caused by an infratentorial lesion to the ventral pons, regardless of etiology. LIS secondary to supratentorial injury is extremely rare, and to our knowledge, this is the first reported case.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report the case of a 26-year-old woman who sustained a gunshot to the left suboccipital area, with supratentorial extension. A diagnosis of incomplete LIS was made on the day of admission, with eye movement preservation. Imaging studies confirmed bilateral injury of the motor homunculus. The clinical course was that of progressive improvement, aided by intensive care unit (ICU) supportive care and early physiotherapy rehabilitation. Her condition improved, and she was discharged to a rehabilitation facility at the end of week 7 postadmission.
   CONCLUSIONS: This is a unique case of incomplete LIS after supratentorial injury. Initial ICU care and early rehabilitation likely played a major role in the full recovery of this patient. The influence of etiology and site of injury on outcome prognosis is also suggested. Although severe diffuse brain injury may occur in the face of an unremarkable computed tomography (CT) scan, the emerging role of magnetic resonance imaging in optimally evaluating traumatic brain injury with discordant clinical and CT information is highlighted and is useful in cases of LIS where prognosis prediction is important.

TI Deciding on Appropriate Telemetric Intracranial Pressure Monitoring

DT Article
DE Hydrocephalus; ICP; Intracranial hypertension; Intracranial pressure;
   Telemetric; Telemetry
ID ICP; IDENTIFICATION; BRAIN
AB BACKGROUND: The clinical advantage of telemetric intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring has previously been limited by issues with inaccuracy and zero-drift. Today, 2 comparable telemetric ICP monitoring systems are available performing adequately in these parameters. The objective of this study is to identify appropriate uses of each system.
   METHODS: The 2 telemetric ICP monitoring systems from Raumedic (implant: Neurovent-P-tel) and Miethke (implant: Sensor Reservoir) are compared in terms of fundamental differences, sensor survival, monitoring possibilities, complications, and cost/benefit. Two illustrative cases are presented highlighting clinical advantages and disadvantages of each system.
   RESULTS: Both systems provide transdermal (telemetric) ICP measurements through external application of a reader unit cabled to a portable data sampler. Thereby, they allow several ICP monitoring sessions without multiple surgical insertions of a cabled ICP sensor. The Miethke implant has a high sampling frequency (40 Hz) and a long CE (Conformite Europeenne) approval (3 years) but cannot be used for long-duration monitoring sessions. In comparison, the Raumedic implant has a lower sampling frequency (5 Hz) and shorter CE approval (90 days) but can be used for long-duration monitoring sessions. The standard 3-year cost for a patient with a Neurovent-P-tel is 17,380 (sic), and for the Sensor Reservoir it is 15,790 (sic).
   CONCLUSIONS: The Miethke system is useful in outpatient clinics where patients have sequential point measurements of ICP performed, whereas the Raumedic system is ideal for long-duration ICP monitoring outside the hospital. When choosing between the 2 systems, it must primarily be decided if the clinical situation requires longduration monitoring sessions or continuous repeated ambulatory follow-up sessions.

ID TUMORS
AB BACKGROUND: Acromegaly caused by Rathke cleft cyst (RCC) mimicking a plurihormonal pituitary adenoma (PA) is rare.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a 71-year-old woman who presented with hyperhidrosis in 2013. Magnetic resonance imaging performed in April 2018 revealed that the patient had a pituitary tumor, and she was referred to our hospital. She presented with an acromegaly-like appearance with mild hypertrophy at her limb extremities. Preoperative blood tests, magnetic resonance imaging, and an endocrine tolerance test indicated that the patient's symptoms satisfied the diagnostic criteria for acromegaly, with a suspected diagnosis of an RCC and growth hormone (GH)-producing PA. Endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery (eTSS) was performed. Permanent pathologic diagnosis showed an RCC mimicking a plurihormonal PA, which was confirmed via immunohistochemistry. Blood sampling 2 months post surgery showed reduced GH (0.41 ng/mL) and increased insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) (356 ng/mL) levels. In addition, a postoperative endocrine tolerance test revealed a parasitic reaction of GH and secondary adrenocortical hypofunction. No RCC recurrence was found, and the GH (0.32 ng/mL) and previously increased IGF-1 (169 ng/mL) levels were normalized 12 months after eTSS.
   CONCLUSIONS: We reported a rare case of acromegaly caused by RCC mimicking a plurihormonal PA. This case suggests that inflammation associated with RCC might be involved in the development of adenomatous cells. Postoperative clinical symptoms and elevated fibrinogen and IGF-1 levels later improved. This outcome suggested that the transient increase in IGF-1 2 months after surgery might reflect RCC-induced inflammation.

AB The World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies (WFNS) Rabat Training Center was established in 2002 following the efforts of Dr. Abdeslam El Khamlichi. This institution has paved the way to guide tremendous change and to improve neurosurgery training in Africa, especially Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The center has enabled so far the training of more than 58 neurosurgical candidates, from approximately 18 countries in SSA, including 30 neurosurgeons who are already back in their respective countries, establishing and improving neurosurgical care. It is clear that this is the first successful example of the WFNS in increasing the neurosurgical workforce in SSA by well-trained and competent neurosurgeons. Consequently, this experience is worth depicting. We reviewed the profile of the neurosurgeons trained in this center and shortly summarized their reestablishment in their respective countries and their challenges to provide neurosurgical care in such source-limited countries.

AB BACKGROUND: Giant Tarlov cysts are always symptomatic and mimic many serious pathologic entities. We present the largest, to our knowledge, reported Tarlov cyst.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 33-year-old woman with Marfan syndrome suffered from right kidney hydronephrosis because of ureter obstruction, for which she was treated with nephrostomy. Her neurologic examination was unremarkable. The role of magnetic resonance imaging in the management of this case is described. Absence of intractranial hypotension symptoms after cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) overdrainage suggested the presence of a valve-like mechanism. The patient was planned for surgical cyst remodeling by the application of titanium clips. The cyst's neck was exposed through an L5-S2 laminectomy. L5 and S1 laminae were severely eroded. CSF leaked out of the underlying, bulging, and thinned dura at each attempt for clip application. Intraoperatively, multiple responses from the S1, S2, and S3 roots were simultaneously recorded at each stimulation. Therefore, we decided to abandon this technique and performed a nonwatertight duroplasty followed by a layered wound closure instead. A week later, the patient received a lumbar-peritoneal shunt. The patient remained neurologically intact, the cyst shrunk, and the nephrostomy was removed.
   CONCLUSIONS: Indirect evidence was helpful to assess for the presence of a valve-like mechanism. Intraoperatively, the surgeon must keep on high alert for sacral erosion to avoid inadvertent dural tear and rootlet injury. Finally, lumboperitoneal diversion remains a valid alternative in the management of our giant Tarlov cyst because it reduced the intracystic pressure that resulted in cyst regression.

AB OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to provide a systematic and comprehensive review of the existing literature regrading postoperative ossification of posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) progression.
   METHODS: Using the PRISMA guidelines, we conducted an exhaustive review of electronic databases. Potential articles were screened and related information was extracted and analyzed. Twenty-four articles with low-quality evidence were included in the review. The findings of the literature review were divided into several groups: the relationship of surgery to OPLL progression; incidence and risk factors; timing and process of OPLL progression; the effect of additional instrumentation on progression; and neurologic deterioration related with progression.
   RESULTS: There was no definitive conclusion for whether surgery could accelerate OPLL progression compared with the natural course. The incidence of postoperative OPLL progression was reported from 3.3% to 74.5%. Younger age, involvement of multiple levels and mixed or continuous types are recognized as risk factors. OPLL could progress transversely and longitudinally and progression in length appeared more significant than progression in thickness. Although radiologic OPLL progression was observed significantly more frequently after laminoplasty than after fusion surgery, whether additional instrumented fusion could suppress progression needs further research. Radiographic progression of OPLL did not positively correspond with neurologic deterioration.
   CONCLUSIONS: The lack of high-level evidence makes it difficult to draw definite conclusions and further research and long-term follow-up clinical studies are needed to better understand postoperative OPLL progression.

TI Case of Childhood Absence Epilepsy with Focal Spikes
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Childhood absence epilepsy; Coexistence; Electroencephalogram; Epilepsy;
   Rolandic spikes
ID SEIZURES; ABNORMALITIES; FEATURES
AB BACKGROUND: Childhood absence epilepsy is a common generalized epilepsy syndrome characterized by childhood onset of frequent sporadic absence seizures. During onset, the electroencephalogram exhibits bilateral, symmetric, and synchronous discharges of approximately 3 Hz of generalized spike-and-wave complexes. Focal spikes are often found in children with focal epilepsy but are not common in absence epilepsy.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: In the case patient, focal spikes were observed during active onset of absence epilepsy and at 5 years after the first hospital visit, at which time absence epilepsy was controlled and medication was withdrawn without focal seizure attack in the interim.
   CONCLUSIONS: This case demonstrates that focal spikes associated with childhood absence epilepsy do not require specific treatment in the absence of focal seizures.

ID SPINAL SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE; ADAMKIEWICZ; DISSECTION; PATIENT
AB BACKGROUND: Radiculomedullary arteries aneurysms are rare, with only few cases so far reported.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report the case of a 54-year-old woman with sudden onset of upper thoracic back pain. Magnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance angiography of the spine showed a cervico-thoraco-lumbar hematoma, with no evidence of underlying vascular malformations. Using Phantom retractors, a unilateral laminectomy was performed at the level of T3, in proximity of the thickest part of the epidural hematoma. No epidural blood was detected. The dura was opened, and subdural and subarachnoid blood was found. After its removal, a fusiform aneurysm of the right radiculomedullary artery was found. The parental vessel was temporarily clipped and the aneurysm removed after ligation of both proximal and distal vessels. No postoperative complications occurred.
   CONCLUSIONS: Rupture of radiculomedullary artery aneurysm always should be considered as differential diagnosis in patients with sudden onset of isolated back pain, headache, and spinal epidural/subdural bleeding. Among different possible treatments, surgery represents a valid option. The use of microsurgical techniques is crucial to achieve a good clinical outcome. A minimally invasive approach can be used to minimize muscle disruption, with minimal blood loss, and faster recovery.

AB BACKGROUND: Chronic subdural hematoma is a frequently clinical common problem encountered in neurosurgery practice. Nevertheless, ossified chronic subdural hematoma is extremely rare, especially in children.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Here we report a case of ossified chronic subdural hematoma in a 7-year-old female child, with a literature review.
   CONCLUSIONS: Because of its infrequency and variable clinical manifestation, ossified chronic subdural hematoma should be considered and included in the differential diagnosis when we encounter an intracranial placeholder.

SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY

DT Article
DE Angle; Carotid artery stent; Complication; Guiding catheter; Reaccess;
   Small balloon bridge
ID ENDARTERECTOMY
AB BACKGROUND: This is new research about the technology for navigating a catheter that is eccentric or tangentially angled to the long axis of a carotid artery stent. In our clinical practice, we found resistance when the 8-French guiding catheter crossed the balloon, even when it was partially expanded. Therefore we intended to improve the operating procedure by using a smaller balloon with a diameter of 2 mm. The smaller balloon can navigate the guiding catheter to reaccess the angled junction with minimal resistance after it is fully expanded.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We applied the small balloon bridge technology in 1 case of left internal carotid artery stent implantation. After the stents were released successfully, we found that it was difficult to recapture an umbrella because the guiding catheter had a steep angle to the long axis of carotid artery with released stents. To overcome this obstacle, we sent a 2-mm balloon into the tip of the catheter and then inflated it fully. Therefore the steep angle could be straightened due to the expanded balloon playing a supportive effect. As a result, the guiding catheter reaccessed the previous angled junction smoothly as the small balloon moved forward and recaptured the umbrella successfully.
   CONCLUSIONS: Using the small balloon bridge technique to navigate the guiding catheter is a safer, simpler, and more effective operation for carotid interventional therapy. Furthermore, it might also be applied to other endovascular treatments that require guiding catheters for intervention.

ID CORD ABSCESS; CHILDREN
AB BACKGROUND: Central nervous system abscesses frequently can be seen in the immunocompromised population and most commonly consist of intracranial collections in the adult patient. Spinal intradural abscesses are less commonly encountered, and there are even fewer numbers in the pediatric population with a concordant absence of documentation in the published literature.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: In this case report, we describe the presentation of a 2-year-old boy with a history of perinatal Escherichia coli meningitis at 2.5 months of age who was found to have an intradural spinal lesion, initially concerning for neoplasm, but later confirmed as an E. coli abscess following biopsy. He was managed with surgical aspiration of the abscess and a long course of intravenous antibiotics. The patient was treated with antibiotics with repeat imaging studies that revealed residual abscess that required re-aspiration at a later date.
   CONCLUSIONS: Here we present an unusual disease process with an unusual disease pathogenesis in a pediatric patient currently residing in a developed country.

ID EPITHELIOID GLIOBLASTOMA; LOW-GRADE; TUMORS; FREQUENCY; OUTCOMES; CANCER
AB BACKGROUND: Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (PXA) is categorized as grade II, other astrocytic tumors per the 2016 World Health Organization classification. Despite being a relatively benign type of tumor, PXA often has an aggressive clinical course. The more malignant form of PXA is now known as anaplastic pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (A-PXA) and is categorized as a grade III tumor. Clinical and genetic factors associated with malignant transformation remain unclear. In particular, typical genetic expression patterns in PXA and A-PXA remain unidentified.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a case of recurrent PXA in which malignant transformation followed a promoter mutation in TERT. In this case, genetic chronologic changes accompanying malignant transformation of PXA were thoroughly examined. The promoter mutation was detected in the second operative specimen after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) at the first tumor recurrence. Subsequently, a malignant transformation to the A-PXA occurred at the time of the second recurrence, and the tumor repeatedly recurred afterward.
   CONCLUSIONS: TERT promotor mutations may contribute to the malignant transformation of PXA; the mechanism of this mutation is unknown, but it may have been caused by SRS. Therefore, improvident use of radiation should be avoided to prevent the malignant transformation of PXA.

AB BACKGROUND: Endovascular mechanical thrombectomy (MT) performed with stent retriever devices have proven efficacious in the treatment of adult patients with acute cerebral ischemia resulting from large-vessel occlusion. Recently, reports describing the use of MT in pediatric large-vessel occlusion have increased. However, these case reports are generally limited to older children and teenagers.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report the use of a Solitaire (Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA) stent retriever for thrombectomy and revascularization of the right middle cerebral artery) in a 6-month-old patient.
   CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the youngest patient reported to be treated with MT using a stent retriever. This case adds to the growing literature that supports the use of MT as a stroke intervention in pediatric patients.

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established surgical technique to address multiple conditions, including Parkinson disease and essential tremor. Data from patients being treated with DBS, as well as those being monitored for seizures with depth electrodes, have suggested improvement in memory with electrical neuromodulation.
   METHODS: MEDLINE was searched from inception through March 2018 using the keywords "DBS," "Deep Brain Stimulation," "Memory," "Memory Modulation," and " Cognition." Studies evaluating the effect of DBS on memory and learning were shortlisted and reviewed.
   RESULTS: Efforts to stimulate various nodes within the memory circuitry suggest that the variable effects may result from different mechanisms, including alteration of neural firing patterns, increased activity across several regions, and amplification of neural plasticity. Some of these targets, such as the entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, and nucleus basalis of Meynert, have shown promising results with regards to modulation of memory.
   CONCLUSIONS: Given the aging population and increasing numbers of patients with memory impairment from neurodegenerative diseases, interest in neuromodulation for memory enhancement will likely expand. Further work should employ more sophisticated responsive stimulation parameters and precise spatial targeting that may lead to an effective stimulation strategy for memory enhancement.

AB OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of endoscopic microvascular decompression (E-MVD) and microscopic microvascular decompression (M-MVD) for the treatment for cranial nerve syndrome caused by vascular compression, including primary trigeminal neuralgia, hemifacial spasm, and glossopharyngeal neuralgia.
   METHODS: A systematic search of the online databases, including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, China Biology Medicine disc, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure, was performed from January 1966 to March 2018. The language of the included literature was not limited. Relevant outcomes of perioperative safety and postoperative efficacy were considered for meta-analysis. Single-arm and cumulative meta-analyses were also conducted. All the outcomes were calculated as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals using R language.
   RESULTS: A total of 9 studies involving 1093 (E-MVD [543] vs. M-MVD [550]) patients were included for analysis in our study. The recent remission rate (92% vs. 86%; OR, 1.71; P = 0.0089), offending vessel discovery rate (99% vs. 95%; OR 2.76, P = 0.0061), and long-term remission rate (97% vs. 87%; OR 4.59, P = 0.0036) were significantly higher in patients who underwent E-MVD than in those who underwent M-MVD, whereas perioperative complications (23% vs. 35%; OR 0.56, P < 0.0001) were significantly lower in patients who underwent E-MVD.
   CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis confirms that E-MVD is superior to M-MVD both in perioperative and postoperative efficacy (short- and long-term), and therefore it should be considered as an appropriate treatment choice for patients with neuralgia and hemifacial spasm.

AB BACKGROUND: Results from studies comparing carotid artery endarterectomy (CEA) with carotid artery stenting (CAS) in the elderly population are variable in the literature. The objective of this study was to investigate whether CEA or CAS is associated with a better safety profile in older adults (>80 years of age) for treatment of symptomatic and asymptomatic stenosis.
   METHODS: A random-effects meta-analysis was performed, and the I-2 statistic was used to assess heterogeneity according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Subgroup analyses were performed as needed.
   RESULTS: Nine studies comprising 5955 patients were included in this meta-analysis. No differences were identified in terms of 30-day stroke (CEA: 5.8% [n = 257/4415]; CAS: 10.5% [n = 81/767]; odds ratio [OR], 0.57; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.30-1.08; I-2 [26.1%), myocardial infarction (MI) (CEA: 1.1% [n = 4/357]; CAS: 0.5% [n = 2/355]; OR, 1.67; 95% CI, 0.37-7.46; I-2 = 0%), transient ischemic attack (TIA) (CEA: 0% [n = 0/98]; CAS: 4.2% [n = 7/166]; OR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.03-2.52; I-2 [0%), death (CEA: 1.5% [n = 8/523]; CAS: 0.9% [n = 4/431]; OR, 1.41; 95% CI, 0.43-4.58; I-2 = 0%), and cranial nerve injury (CEA: 5.8% [n = 3/51]; CAS: 0% [n = 0/51]; OR, 4.74; 95% CI, 0.5-44.98; I-2 = 0%). A subgroup comparing CEA with transfemoral protected CAS showed that patients in the CEA group had a statistically significant lower risk of 30-day stroke (OR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.17-0.57; I-2 = 30.8%).
   CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that CEA is associated with a statistically significant lower risk of 30-day stroke in the elderly population compared with transfemoral CAS with distal or proximal protection. No differences were noted in the rates of periprocedural TIA, MI, death, and cranial nerve injury between CEA and CAS in the original pooled analysis.

AB BACKGROUND: Pedicle screws (PSs) are routinely used for stabilization to enhance fusion in a variety of spinal diseases. Although the accuracy of different PS placement methods has been previously reported, most of these studies have been limited to 1 or 2 techniques. The purpose was to determine the current accuracy of PS placement among 4 modalities of PS insertion (freehand [FH], fluoroscopy-assisted [FA], computed tomography navigation-guided [CTNav], and robot-assisted [RA]) and analyze variables associated with screw misplacement.
   METHODS: A systematic review was performed of peer-reviewed articles reporting PS accuracy of 1 technique from January 1990 to June 2018. Accuracy of PS placement, PS insertion technique, and pedicle breach (PB) data were collected. A meta-analysis was performed to estimate the overall pooled (OP) rates of PS accuracy as a primary outcome, stratified by screw insertion techniques. Potential determinants were analyzed via meta-regression analyses.
   RESULTS: Seventy-eight studies with 7858 patients, 51,161 PSs, and 3614 cortical PBs were included. CTNav showed the highest PS placement accuracy compared with other techniques: OP accuracy rates were 95.5%, 93.1%, 91.5%, and 90.5%, via CTNav, FH, FA, and RA techniques, respectively. RA and CTNav were associated with the highest PS accuracy in the thoracic spine, compared with FH.
   CONCLUSIONS: The OP data show that CTNav has the highest PS accuracy rates. Thoracic PSs were associated with lower accuracy rates; however, RA showed fewer breaches in the thoracic spine compared with FH and FA. Given the heterogeneity among studies, further standardized and comparative investigations are required to confirm our findings.

ID PREINJURY WARFARIN; INJURY; AGE
AB BACKGROUND: Significant morbidity and mortality is associated with surgical evacuation of acute subdural hematomas (ASDHs) in the elderly population. The literature remains mixed on risk factors associated with poor outcomes, specifically preoperative antithrombotic usage and postoperative seizures.
   METHODS: Between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2017, we retrospectively identified 62 patients >= 65 years of age who underwent a craniotomy for evacuation of an ASDH, with the primary outcome being Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) score at discharge and 3- and 6-month follow-up.
   RESULTS: Of the patients, 52% were women, with a median age of 78 years (range, 65-93 years). The mechanism of injury was because of a fall in 40 patients. Twenty-eight patients (44%) had a poor outcome (GOS score 1-2) at discharge, increasing to 31 patients (50%) at 3-month follow-up. Eight patients (13%) had a good outcome (GOS score 4-5) at discharge, increasing to 17 patients (27%) at 3-month follow-up. Perioperative mortality rate was 39%, increasing to 44% at 3-month follow-up. The strongest associations with mortality in descending order were 24-hour postoperative Glasgow Come Scale (GCS) score, midline shift, preoperative GCS score, and pupillary abnormalities. Although age was not a statistically significant factor for mortality, patients with a favorable outcome (GOS score 4-5) had a median age of 71 years versus 78 years for GOS score 1-3. Preoperative antithrombotic usage and postoperative seizures were not significant predictors of outcome or mortality.
   CONCLUSIONS: A high percentage of morbidity and mortality remains in the management of ASDHs in the elderly population; however, a significant percentage (27%) can still go on to have a favorable outcome.

ID INFECTIONS
AB OBJECTIVE: We explored the external ventricular drain (EVD) practices in Thailand.
   METHODS: We performed a survey-based study to describe EVD insertion, maintenance, quality improvement (QI) practices, and incidence of EVD infection.
   RESULTS: The study included 58 of 101 hospitals contacted (57.4% response rate), with >= 600 beds (44.8%) and dedicated neurocritical care units (53%). The reasons for EVD placement included aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, traumatic brain injury, and ventriculoperitoneal shunt malfunction or infection; 75.9% of the hospitals cared for <= 100 EVDs annually. In Thailand, nonantimicrobial EVD catheters (98.3%) were used most often. Most hospitals (56.9%) did not routinely sample the cerebrospinal fluid. Prophylactic daily antibiotic use was prevalent (62.1%). Most hospitals (77.6%) did not measure the intracranial pressure during intrahospital transport. EVD infection was a commonly (69%) tracked QI measure; however, up to one third of the hospitals did not track any EVD QI measure. Most hospitals (94.8%) had no written EVD insertion and maintenance protocols. Most hospitals (79.3%) reported an EVD infection rate of <= 5% in the previous year. The low EVD infection rate, high cost, and/or the lack of equipment could account for the low usage of antimicrobial catheters and intracranial pressure monitoring.
   CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study have identified QI opportunities in EVD management in Thailand. The development of an EVD-related QI process, reliable tracking of EVD infection rates, adaptation of U.S. guidelines to create standardized EVD protocols, and examination of the association between EVD practices and clinical outcomes in low-to middle-income countries are urgently needed.

AB OBJECTIVE: After a craniotomy procedure to access the brain, neurosurgeons have several options to fix the bone flap to the skull. The aim of this study was to assess if a polymeric clamplike fixation system (Cranial LOOP) is a safe and reliable system that maintains over time an appropriate alignment of the bone flap.
   METHODS: This is an observational, retrospective, case series study of 60 patients who underwent a craniotomy and were subject to cranial bone flap fixation with the Cranial LOOP fixation system. Baseline clinical parameters, surgical variables, medical records, and all postoperative medical images available were reviewed to assess the bone flap alignment and potential adverse events.
   RESULTS: A total of 182 Cranial LOOPs were implanted in the 60 patients (56.01 +/- 20.21 years, 55% women) included in the study. The cranial fixation system maintained a good bone flap alignment in 95% of the patients studied immediately after surgery and in up to 96.7% of them at the end of follow-up. No intraoperative complications were reported. An ulcer potentially related to a device was detected, which was solved without the need for device removal. No artifacts were observed in any of the 219 medical images analyzed.
   CONCLUSIONS: Cranial LOOP is a safe and reliable postoperative long-term cranial bone flap fixation system. This device can fix the bone flap after a wide range of craniotomy procedures, performed in multiple locations, and provides good bone flap alignment. Cranial LOOP does not interfere in patient follow-up through medical imaging.

AB BACKGROUND: Despite the superb visualization offered by the endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal approach, the resection rates of large and giant pituitary adenomas have remained much lower than those of smaller macroadenomas. Various tumor characteristics can influence the extent of resection (EOR) and have been variably reported. Additional understanding of these factors is mandatory to improve the results. We analyzed the radiological and intraoperative tumor characteristics influencing the EOR in a cohort of patients with large and giant pituitary macroadenomas undergoing endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal excision under our care.
   METHODS: Twenty-eight patients were included. Magnetic resonance images were retrospectively analyzed for pre- and postoperative tumor volumetric analysis; preoperative tumor volume calculation using the formula (A x B x C/2); preoperative radioanatomical characteristics, including tumor shape, radiological structure, contrast enhancement, and extension; and the EOR. Intraoperative data were retrieved and included.
   RESULTS: The preoperative calculated tumor volume was 38.14 +/- 23.02 cm(3) and the preoperative measured tumor volume was 50.345 +/- 17.36 cm(3). A statistically significant difference was found between the calculated and measured tumor volumes for the whole cohort and for tumors with a maximum diameter >3.9 cm. A statistically significant difference in the EOR was found at a volume threshold of 26.2 cm(3). Large cysts, heterogeneous enhancement, Knosp grade <= 2, soft tumor consistency, and tumor hemorrhage were significantly associated with gross total resection.
   CONCLUSIONS: Volumetric analysis should replace 2-dimensional methods in determining the size of large and giant pituitary adenomas. Specific tumor characteristics were associated with the EOR and could help in predicting the EOR for these tumors.

AB BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of death and disability. This study evaluated a possible relationship between serum factors at admission and the outcome of TBI. We propose a statistically validated scale for patients with TBI that combines serum factors and the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS).
   METHODS: Between May 2011 and July 2016, 219 patients underwent decompressive craniectomy for TBI. We assessed laboratory data on admission, and correlations with GSC and Glasgow Outcome Scale were investigated. The modified GCS was developed from a multivariable logistic regression model, which was validated with the backward stepwise method.
   RESULTS: Of 219 patients with TBI enrolled in our study, 175 were men (79.9%) and 44 were women (20.1%) with a mean age of 49.1 +/- 11.5 years. Initial serum values of hemoglobin, platelets, prothrombin time, and lactate dehydrogenase were associated with in-hospital mortality. The factor score was derived by adding the following points: hemoglobin (>= 13.0 g/dL [0, < 13.0 g/dL = 1), platelets (>= 150 x 10(3)/mm(3) [0, < 150 x 10(3)/mm(3) = 1), prothrombin time (< 13.2 seconds [0, >= 13.2 seconds = 1), and lactate dehydrogenase (< 271 U/L = 0, >= 271 U/L = 1). The modified GCS score (GCS score [range, 6-15] - FS [range, 0-4]) was calculated.
   CONCLUSIONS: The modified GCS score using serum factors extended the information provided about patient outcomes to be comparable to more complex methods. The modified GCS score may be useful to predict in-hospital mortality in patients with TBI.

ID GENERAL-SURGERY; RECRUITMENT; ROTATIONS; EXPOSURE; IMPACT
AB BACKGROUND: The deficit in access to neurosurgical care worldwide remains a challenge, particularly in the developing economies such as Nigeria, where the neurosurgeon density is low. The concern that arguably subsists in sub-Saharan Africa is the decline in the number of recruited candidates into surgical specialty training programs, including neurosurgery, despite increasing burden of surgical cases. This study assessed the perception and willingness of medical undergraduates regarding neurosurgery career and determined the factors influencing their choice. This understanding will be critical to advancing ways of motivating them toward a neurosurgery career.
   METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 256 consenting final-year medical students of the College of Medicine, University of Ibadan, Nigeria. Data on the perception (of) and willingness to choose neurosurgery career were obtained. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics and chi(2) test at P < 0.05.
   RESULTS: The mean age of respondents was 24.9 +/- 1.9 years. Within the duration of their clinical trainings, almost all (96.1%) the respondents had 1-2 neurosurgical postings. Although surgery was the most preferred specialty, only 7.8% of the respondents reported a willingness to choose neurosurgery as a career. Proffered reasons for dissatisfaction with neurosurgical postings were unfriendly teaching environment (52.6%) and incessant industrial strikes, coupled with stress among trainers and residents (27.7%). More male than female students were willing to choose neurosurgery career (P = 0.027).
   CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicated that the proportion of final-year medical students willing to choose neurosurgery career was low and there was sex disparity in the willingness to pursue a neurosurgical career.

ID HEMATOMA
AB BACKGROUND: In Cambodia, the most common victims of traumatic brain injury (TBI) are men 20-30 years of age involved in motor vehicle collision. Secondary injury sustained by these patients occurs during the time period between initial insult and hospital admission. Strengthening prehospital systems for TBI in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) such as Cambodia is therefore a key element of the development agenda for universal health equity. We report a retrospective analysis of the relationship between prehospital delays and TBI outcomes among patients from a large government hospital in Cambodia.
   METHODS: Data were collected from 3476 patients with TBI admitted to a major government hospital in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, from June 2013 to June 2018. Patients with missing data or those admitted >8 hours postinjury were excluded. Statistical analyses examined associations between injury-to-admission delay (IAD) and outcomes such as Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) score and length of stay (LOS).
   RESULTS: A total of 2125 patients with TBI (76.85% men) were included. The median age was 27 years (interquartile range, 22-37 years). Injury severity at presentation included 1406 mild (66%), 464 moderate (22%), and 240 severe cases (11%). No Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) data were available for 15 patients (1%). We found an inverse relationship between IAD and GOS score, most evidently for mild and moderate TBI (n = 1870; 88%). Regression analysis revealed a marked decrease in GOS score at the IAD >4-hour threshold. Each 30-minute delay in IAD was correlated with >2-hour increase in LOS for mild (P < 0.001) and moderate TBI (P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: In a retrospective cohort of >2000 patients with TBI from Cambodia, we found that increasing IAD was associated with worsening outcome, especially beyond the 4-hour threshold. These data should inform development of prehospital guidelines for TBI care in LMICs.

AB BACKGROUND: Electrical bicycles (E-bikes) allow people of all ages to ride at high speeds but have an inherent risk of traumatic brain injury (TBI). Their sales have increased tremendously in recent years.
   METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study to compare the incidence and severity of TBI in E-bikers and conventional bicyclists. We included patients at a Swiss level 1 trauma center admitted from 2010 to 2015. The primary outcome was the association between TBI and the bicycle type. The secondary outcome was the association between helmet use and TBI severity.
   RESULTS: Of 557 patients injured riding an E-bike (n = 73) or a bicycle (n = 484), 60% sustained a TBI, most of which were mild (Glasgow coma scale [GCS] score, 13-15; E-bike, 78%; bicycle, 88%). TBI was more often moderate (GCS score, 9-12) or severe (GCS score, 3-8) in E-bikers than in bicyclists (P = 0.04). Intracranial hemorrhage, traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, and subdural hematoma occurred significantly more often in E-bikers than in bicyclists (P < 0.05). Neurosurgical intervention was necessary for 5 E-bikers (7%) and 25 (5%) bicyclists (P = 0.15). Wearing a helmet correlated with a lower risk of neurosurgical intervention in bicyclists (odds ratio [OR], 0.21; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.06-0.73; P = 0.01) and a lower risk of calvarial fractures in both bicyclists (OR, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.06-0.42; P < 0.01) and E-bikers (OR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.05-0.84; P = 0.03).
   CONCLUSIONS: E-bikers had a significantly greater risk of moderate to severe TBI compared with bicyclists. Helmet use was associated with decreased odds of severe TBI in bicyclists and a tendency toward a more favorable outcome for E-bikers.

AB OBJECTIVE: Neuronavigation procedures demand high precision and accuracy. Despite this need, there are still few studies analyzing errors in such procedures. The aim of this study was to use a custom- built cranial phantom to measure target position and orientation errors in different phases of a simulated neuronavigation procedure.
   METHODS: A cranial phantom with 10 target sites was designed and imaged with computed tomography and magnetic resonance. A segmentation of a cloud of points of the phantom (ground truth) was obtained using an optical tracking system and compared with the images (imaging phase). Targets and trajectories were then planned with neuronavigation software and compared with the ground truth (planning phase). The same plan was used to identify the points in real space after image-to-phantom registration and calculate the final error of the procedure by comparison with the ground truth (registration and execution phase).
   RESULTS: The mean errors after the imaging phase were 1.11 +/- 0.42 mm and 3.23 degrees +/- 1.69 degrees for position and orientation, respectively. After planning the mean errors were 1.10 +/- 0.39 mm and 5.55 degrees +/- 2.91 degrees. The global errors after the registration and mechanical execution were 3.93 +/- 1.70 mm and 3.65 degrees +/- 1.29 degrees.
   CONCLUSIONS: After a stepwise analysis, registration and mechanical execution were the main contributors to the global position error.

AB BACKGROUND: Traumatic acute subdural hematomas (ASDHs) showed the highest mortality of intracranial hematomas. The aim of the current study was to identify predictive factors of poor prognosis among patients who were operated on.
   METHODS: This is a single-center retrospective cohort study of 82 patients who underwent surgical evacuation of a traumatic ASDH between January 2009 and December 2016. The epidemiologic, clinical, radiologic, and surgical features were recorded. Postoperative outcome were assessed by the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) score at 6 months. Univariate and multivariate analysis and a classification and regression tree (CART) were performed.
   RESULTS: At 6 months, 76% of patients achieved an unfavorable outcome (GOS score 1-3). The context of polytrauma (P = 0.03) and ASDH thickness >= 20 mm (P = 0.02) were significantly associated with poor outcome in the multivariate analysis. The CART algorithm isolated 3 subgroups of patients with an unfavorable prognosis: polytrauma (91%), isolated head injury (HI) featuring an ASDH thickness >= 20 mm (89%), or isolated HI featuring a thickness < 20 mm in a patient older than 54 years (71%). Isolated patients with HI younger than 54 years harboring an ASDH < 20 mm thick had the most promising results, with 53% with a GOS score of 4 or 5.
   CONCLUSIONS: The context of polytrauma, ASDH thickness, and age were major predictive factors of poor prognosis in patients with surgically evacuated traumatic ASDH. The CART algorithm using these features isolated subgroups with decreasingly unfavorable outcome, providing a relevant statistical tool to apply to future studies of traumatic ASDH.

TI Comparison of Complication and Revision Rates After Frontal Versus

   Pressure Hydrocephalus
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Hydrocephalus; Revision surgery; Shunt malfunction; Technique;

ID CATHETER PLACEMENT
AB BACKGROUND: Ventricular shunts are most commonly placed via a frontal or parietal approach. However, there is a paucity of data comparing complication and revision rates associated with these approaches in the idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) population.
   METHODS: Patients with iNPH treated with ventricular shunting between 2001 and 2017 at our institution were included for analysis. Patient characteristics, catheter accuracy, and incidence of revision were determined from the medical record. Catheter accuracy was determined using axial computed tomography imaging and classified as grade 1, 2, or 3 based on location of the catheter tip.
   RESULTS: There were 348 patients included for analysis with 266 (76.4%) and 82 (23.6%) receiving a frontal versus parietal shunt, respectively. Patients undergoing the parietal approach were more likely to receive a programmable valve (37.8% vs. 25.2%; P = 0.026). Neuronavigation was used more frequently for patients undergoing the parietal approach (26.8% vs. 4.1%; P < 0.001); however, a minority of cases used neuronavigation in general (9.5%). There was no difference in catheter accuracy between the 2 approaches and no difference in catheter accuracy with the use of neuronavigation. The overall revision rate was 21.0%, and there were no differences in the incidence of revisions between the frontal and parietal approaches (21.8% vs. 18.3%, respectively; P = 0.495). There were no differences in revision subtypes between the approaches.
   CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the type of approach for shunting may not have a significant impact on complication and revision rates in patients with iNPH, and either approach is a reasonable first-line option.

AB OBJECTIVE: This study examined the use of noninstrumented posterolateral lumbar fusion with bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and compared its effectiveness with that of instrumented fusion for the treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) with spondylolisthesis in elderly patients.
   METHODS: This study was a retrospective review of 93 patients treated in a single-surgeon neurosurgical private practice over a 15-year period. Fifty-nine patients over the age of 65 who underwent noninstrumented posterolateral fusion with rhBMP-2 (Infuse) for LSS with spondylolisthesis were compared with 34 patients who underwent instrumented fusion without rhBMP-2. Outcomes in terms of reoperation rate, pain improvement, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) score, and number of extra follow-up visits due to persistent problems were characterized by the use of t tests and chi(2) tests.
   RESULTS: The reoperation rate in the noninstrumented rhBMP-2 fusion group was significantly lower than in the instrumented fusion group (17.6% vs. 3.4%, P = 0.048). The mean pain improvement was significantly higher in the noninstrumented rhBMP-2 group at 3 months (8.1 vs. 6.0, P < 0.001, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2 to 3.0) and at 1 year (7.25 vs. 5.6, P = 0.030, 95% CI 0.3 to 3.1). The ODI score improvement was significantly higher in the noninstrumented rhBMP-2 group (51 vs. 42.8, P < 0.001, 95% CI 4.7 to 11.6). The mean number of additional follow-up visits per patient was significantly lower in the noninstrumented rhBMP-2 group (0.068 vs. 1.23, P < 0.001, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.75).
   CONCLUSION: Noninstrumented posterolateral lumbar fusion with rhBMP-2 in elderly patients with LSS and spondylolisthesis is a viable alternative to instrumented fusion based on clinical outcomes measured in this study.

AB BACKGROUND: The number of metastases that can be treated safely and effectively with Gamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) remains controversial despite continuing evidence to support its expanded utilization. We endeavored to elucidate the survival outcomes for patients who presented with >= 15 brain metastases at the time of initial SRS.
   METHODS: This retrospective analysis reviewed patients treated for >= 15 brain metastases originating from breast cancer, lung cancer, or melanoma. Ninety-three patients met the inclusion criteria. In this study, 3016 tumors were treated. The median number of tumors at the first SRS procedure was 23 (range, 15-67) for breast cancer, 21 (range, 15-48) for lung cancer, and 21 (range, 15-67) for melanoma. The mean aggregate metastases volume was 8.75 cm(3) for breast, 6.89 cm(3) for lung, and 9.98 cm(3) for melanoma.
   RESULTS: Patients with breast cancer, lung cancer, and melanoma had a median survival after diagnosis of brain metastases of 18.0, 9.4, and 6.3 months, respectively. The survival after SRS was 16 months for breast cancer, 4.6 months for lung cancer, and 3.1 months for melanoma. Patients with breast cancer had significantly longer survival than patients with lung cancer and melanoma after SRS (P = 0.001). A higher Karnofsky Performance Status score was associated with an increase in survival across all tumor types. Repeat SRS for local or distant progression was performed in 56% of patients with breast cancer, 35% of patients with lung cancer, and 24% of patients with melanoma.
   CONCLUSIONS: SRS is an effective means of managing extensive brain metastases, particularly in patients with breast cancer. The primary tumor type, systemic disease, and performance status heavily influence survival outcomes.

AB BACKGROUND: Arterial disruption during brain surgery can cause devastating injuries to wide expanses of white and gray matter beyond the tumor resection cavity. Such damage may occur as a result of disrupting blood flow through en passage arteries. Identification of these arteries is critical to prevent unforeseen neurologic sequelae during brain tumor resection. In this study, we discuss one such artery, termed the artery of aphasia (AoA), which when disrupted can lead to receptive and expressive language deficits.
   METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of all patients undergoing an awake craniotomy for resection of a glioma by the senior author from 2012 to 2018. Patients were included if they experienced language deficits secondary to postoperative infarction in the left posterior temporal lobe in the distribution of the AoA. The gross anatomy of the AoA was then compared with activation likelihood estimations of the auditory and semantic language networks using coordinate-based meta-analytic techniques.
   RESULTS: We identified 4 patients with left-sided posterior temporal artery infarctions in the distribution of the AoA on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. All 4 patients developed substantial expressive and receptive language deficits after surgery. Functional language improvement occurred in only 2/4 patients. Activation likelihood estimations localized parts of the auditory and semantic language networks in the distribution of the AoA.
   CONCLUSIONS: The AoA is prone to blood flow disruption despite benign manipulation. Patients seem to have limited capacity for speech recovery after intraoperative ischemia in the distribution of this artery, which supplies parts of the auditory and semantic language networks.

AB BACKGROUND: Laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) presents an important new minimally invasive tool in the management of drug-resistant mesial temporal epilepsy (MTE). However, because of its relative novelty, not much is known about long-term seizure freedom rates. The objective of this study was to evaluate the postsurgical seizure outcome following LITT after a minimum follow-up period of 2 years.
   METHODS: Medical records of all patients who underwent LITT for MTE from 2013 to 2018 at our comprehensive epilepsy center under a single surgeon were retrospectively reviewed. Data related to demographics, presurgical evaluations, and seizure outcome were compared between seizure-free (SF) and non-seizure-free (NSF) patients.
   RESULTS: In all, 26 patients were identified with at least 2 years of follow-up. Mean age was 43.8 years +/- 11.6 years, and 46.2% were female. After a mean follow-up time of 42.9 months (range, 24.3-58.8 months), 61.5% (16/26) were free of disabling seizures, and 26.9% (7/26) had only rare disabling seizures. Whereas seizure-freedom rates between patients with and without mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) were not statistically different (68% vs. 43%, P = 0.23), NSF patients without MTS had a shorter median time to first seizure than did NSF patients with MTS (0.55 month vs. 10 months, log-rank test P = 0.007). Postoperative complications occurred in 2 patients (7.7%), consisting of 1 permanent and 1 transient homonymous hemianopia.
   CONCLUSIONS: LITT appears to be a safe and effective initial surgical option for treatment-resistant MTE. Among patients who have seizures after treatment, those without MTS appear to have seizures earlier than those with MTS.

AB BACKGROUND: Spinal cord injury (SCI) may result in neuromotor, sensory, and autonomic function damages. Edema because of spinal cord trauma can reach serious dimensions. The aim of this study was to histologically evaluate the effects of duraplasty on neural tissues.
   METHODS: Twenty-eight Wistar rats were randomly divided into 4 experimental groups: group 1 received laminectomy without SCI (sham); group 2 received laminectomy and SCI with the weight drop method; group 3 received laminectomy, SCI, and duraplasty within the first 6-8 hours of SCI; and group 4 received laminectomy, SCI, and duraplasty after 24 hours of SCI. The neurologic functions of the rats were tested periodically. All animals were euthanized 28 days after the surgery. Histopathologic and immunohistochemical evaluations were performed, and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used for statistical comparison of data between the groups.
   RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the Tarlov examination scores from different time points between the groups. The number of neurons stained with nuclear factor kappa beta was higher in group 3 than groups 1 and 4. The number of neurons stained with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling was higher in group 2 than group 3.
   CONCLUSIONS: Decompressive laminectomy is a procedure frequently used in spinal trauma surgery. However, it is often unclear whether the decompression is fully adequate. Our results will aid the development of further studies regarding the reliability of duraplasty in the treatment of SCI.

ID SURGICAL SITE INFECTION; WOUND-INFECTION; SPONDYLODISCITIS; RATES
AB BACKGROUND: The postoperative infection rates for transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) have ranged from <2% to 4%. However, no consensus has been reached on the treatment strategies. TLIF cage preservation or revision surgery for lumbar spine reconstruction are 2 possible treatments. We aimed to determine the most effective method for organ/space infection control.
   METHODS: The data from 4923 patients who had undergone TLIF with cage and posterior pedicle-screw instrumentation for spondylolysis or degenerative spondylolisthesis from January 2008 to December 2015 were retrospectively analyzed. Of the 4923 patients, 32 (0.65%) had developed organ/space infection of the interbody cage and were divided into 2 groups: those whose interbody cage was removed for revision (group 1) and those who interbody cage was retained (group 2). We compared the initial management of both groups in terms of age, sex, elapsed time to diagnosis, changes in spinal lordotic angle, visual analog scale score, fusion status, and Kirkaldy-Willis functional outcomes.
   RESULTS: The 32 patients with organ/space infection had a mean age of 66.3 years and a follow-up period of 23.8 months. Significant differences were observed in the mean elapsed time to diagnosis (P = 0.004), lordotic angle correction at the disease level (P = 0.03), and Kirkaldy-Wallis functional outcomes (P = 0.01). Of the 17 patients undergoing debridement for implant retention, 9 (52.9%) exhibited poor results.
   CONCLUSIONS: The most important factor contributing to TLIF cage retention failure was epidural fibrosis of the previous transforaminal route and biofilm adhesion on interbody devices affecting infection clearance. Thus, we would recommend a combined anterior and posterior approach or the transforaminal route for radical debridement with cage removal and fusion to achieve better clinical outcomes.

ID CEREBRAL PERFUSION-PRESSURE; SONOGRAPHY; MODERATE
AB BACKGROUND: Cerebral hemodynamic transformation is a relatively common finding in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Knowledge of cerebral hemodynamic disturbance may assist in predicting the management outcome. Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) monitoring of patients with TBI can be used to reveal various pathologic hemodynamic changes. The objective of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes of postoperative routine intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring versus ICP monitoring combined with TCD monitoring in patients with brain trauma after decompressive craniectomy.
   METHODS: This was a retrospective study of 30 patients with TBI who underwent ICP combined with TCD monitoring (after 2015) compared with a historical control group of 30 patients who only underwent routine ICP monitoring (in 2013-2014). ICP, partial pressure of carbon dioxide, hemoglobin, and hematocrit values were monitored and recorded on a daily basis for 7 days after operation. Neuroimaging was also performed at admission. Neurologic outcome was assessed at 2 weeks and 6 months after operation using the Glasgow Outcome Score Extended (GOS-E). Unconditional multivariable logistic regression was conducted to analyze the factors for favorable clinical outcome.
   RESULTS: Two weeks after operation, there were no differences in mortality rate between the 2 groups (P = 0.643). When considering the GOS-E score at 6 months, there were no differences in clinical prognosis between the 2 groups (P = 0.101), but the ICP combined with TCD monitoring group showed a higher frequency of patients with favorable outcome compared with the routine ICP monitoring group (P = 0.043). Unconditional multivariable logistic regression results showed that no factor was independently associated with GOS-E at 6 months.
   CONCLUSIONS: TCD could be helpful for the serial monitoring of cerebral hemodynamic changes after decompressive craniectomy for TBI, which could be beneficial for neurologic outcome improvement.

ID REPAIR
AB OBJECTIVE: Superior semicircular canal dehiscence (SSCD) is caused by a deformity in the arcuate eminence, leading to various vestibular and auditory symptoms that can manifest unilaterally or bilaterally. The aim of the present study was to distinguish the differences in symptoms, treatment options, and outcomes between patients with unilateral and bilateral SSCD.
   METHODS: A retrospective medical record analysis was conducted to identify patients with SSCD treated at a tertiary care center from March 2011 to May 2017. The patient demographic data, preoperative symptom presentation, and postoperative outcomes were extracted. Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics. Fisher's exact tests were computed to investigate the relationships between binary variables, with a significance level of P < 0.05.
   RESULTS: A total of 99 patients with SSCD had been treated at our institution from March 2011 to May 2017. Of these 99 patients, 41 (41.4%) had a diagnosis of bilateral SSCD. Of the 41 patients with bilateral SSCD, 27 (65.9%) were women, and the mean age was 53.6 +/- 10.9 years (range, 31.7-73.9). The most common presenting symptom was tinnitus (n = 33; 80.4%) and dizziness (n = 33; 80.4%). Previous trauma to the head correlated with a bilateral SSCD presentation (P = 0.04). Trends were reported between female sex and bilateral SSCD [r(35) = 0.32379; P = 0.0506]. Postoperatively, trends were also found, with greater rates of dizziness in patients with bilateral SSCD compared with those with unilateral SSCD (odds ratio, 3.81; P = 0.0659), and less improvement in dizziness (odds ratio, 0.186; P = 0.0627). No other significant differences were found between the symptoms or clinical outcomes and improvements between the bilateral and unilateral cohorts.
   CONCLUSION: Bilateral SSCD might result in different clinical symptoms that are more prevalent compared with unilateral SSCD. The findings from the present series of patients with bilateral SSCD suggest that patient symptoms and history are important in the diagnosis of bilateral SSCD and deciding whether 1 or both dehiscences requires surgical intervention.

AB BACKGROUND: Seizures are the second most common clinical presentation in patients with brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and the most common presentation of unruptured AVMs. The aim of the present multicenter, retrospective cohort study was to identify the predictors of seizure presentation in patients with AVM who had undergone stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS).
   METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of patients with AVM who had been treated with SRS at 8 participating International Radiosurgery Research Foundation sites. The patient and AVM characteristics were compared between those with and without seizure presentation in univariable and multivariable models. A subgroup analysis of patients with cortical AVMs was performed.
   RESULTS: The study cohort included 2333 patients with AVM, including 419 (18%) with and 1914 (82%) without a seizure presentation. Previous AVM resection (odds ratio [OR], 7.65; P = 0.001), a lack of previous AVM hemorrhage (OR, 0.004; P < 0.001), a cortical AVM location (OR, 1559.42; P < 0.001), a lower Spetzler-Martin grade (OR, 0.51; P = 0.007), and a higher Virginia radiosurgery AVM score (OR, 1.46; P = 0.008) were independent predictors of seizure presentation. The rate of seizure presentation in patients with cortical AVMs was 27%. Previous AVM resection (OR, 8.36; P < 0.001), a lack of previous AVM hemorrhage (OR, 0.004; P < 0.001), and temporal AVM location (OR, 4.15; P < 0.001) were independent predictors of seizure presentation for cortical AVMs.
   CONCLUSION: We identified multiple factors associated with seizure presentation in patients with AVM to undergo SRS. Previous AVM resection, a cortical AVM location, and a lack of previous AVM hemorrhage were the strongest predictors of pre-SRS seizures. The Spetzler-Martin grade and Virginia radiosurgery AVM score might have a role in seizure risk stratification. For cortical AVMs, a temporal lobe location was predictive of seizure presentation.

AB BACKGROUND: Growing rod techniques have been demonstrated to be a valuable treatment in early-onset scoliosis; however, repeated surgeries and general anesthesia cannot be avoided.
   METHODS: This study included 12 immature swine that were randomly assigned to receive either a novel growing rod system (experimental group) or a traditional growing rod system (control group). Lengthening was undertaken at 4-week intervals, for a total observation period of 12 weeks. Radiography, computed tomography, and motion analysis of the spine were conducted to evaluate rod extension, growth and nonfusion of the spine, and fixation.
   RESULTS: One swine (control group) was excluded from the analysis because of a deep wound infection at 1 week after the initial operation. No complications were observed in the remaining 11 swine. In the experimental group, the average lengthening operation lasted 12.1 +/- 3.1 minutes, and average incision length was 1.1 +/- 0.2 cm; both values were significantly less compared with the control group (P < 0.001). No significant between-group differences in mean trunk length, body mass, or thickness of cephalad-instrumented or caudad-instrumented vertebrae and intervertebral disks were present before the initial operation or at the final assessment (12 weeks after operation; P > 0.05). Spinal growth and motion of instrumented spinal segments were conserved.
   CONCLUSIONS: The novel growing rod system is safe and effective in immature swine, preserving spine growth potential and involving less surgical trauma.

AB BACKGROUND: Clear cell sarcoma (CCS) is a rare malignant soft tissue tumor with poor prognosis owing to metastasis and insensitive response to chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
   METHODS: We first searched PubMed and Embase using the terms "clear cell sarcoma," "malignant melanoma of soft tissue," "head," and "neck." In the 15 articles selected for literature review, only 27% (4/15) of patients were diagnosed with primary CCS of the head. Pathologically, those tumors arose from either the scalp or the superficial temporal fascia, but none invaded the skull and brain. Next, the search was performed in the same database using the terms "clear cell sarcoma," "malignant melanoma of soft tissue," and "bone," and only 24 articles were selected.
   RESULTS: In the case reported here, a 36-year-old woman was found to have a palpable mass located at the left temporal-occipital region, and surgical finding confirmed the invasion into the skull and the brain. The diagnosis of primary CCS was made because of the detection of t(12;22)(q13;q12) in >50% of tumor cells by fluorescence in situ hybridization, and metastasis to the lymph nodes and lungs was discovered by postoperative positron emission tomography-computed tomography.
   CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of primary central nervous system CCS. Primary CCS may involve the skull and should be one of the differential diagnoses for intra-extracranial communicating tumors. Further research on biological characteristics and molecular targeted therapy of CCS are needed to improve its poor prognosis.

AB OBJECTIVE: Skull fractures caused by birth injury are mainly compression and linear fractures, but the incidence is known to be rare. It has been recently suggested, however, that greenstick fractures (GSFs) are more common than compression or linear fractures that are detected through 3-dimensional reconstructed computed tomography. Therefore, this study was conducted to determine the correlation of GSF with perinatal factors, the accompanying head injury factors, and the long-term outcomes in neonates.
   METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on correlations between GSF and perinatal and head injury factors for 295 neonates. In 160 neonates, the correlation with long-term outcome was investigated.
   RESULTS: In 295 neonates, 47 cases had 3 or fewer GSFs, 66 cases had 4-6, 82 cases had 7-9, and 100 cases had 10 or more. The number of GSFs was significantly associated with gestational age and mode of delivery among the perinatal factors, with brain swelling and cephalohematoma among the head injury factors. It was also associated with long-term outcomes. The cut-off value of the number of GSFs for a poor outcome by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 6 or greater.
   CONCLUSIONS: It was concluded that GSF most commonly occurs as a birth-related skull fracture and that birth-related GSF is associated with perinatal factors, birth-related head injuries, and deterioration of long-term development. Therefore, efforts should be made to prevent GSF at birth.

   DEPRESSION
AB BACKGROUND: Prospective patient-reported outcomes (PROs) registries are central to emerging evidence-driven reform models. These registries entail significant operator and responder burden to capture PROs data. It is important to limit the number of PROs administered. We sought to determine whether the anxiety/depression domain of EQ-5D could be used to define preoperative psychological distress in patients undergoing elective spine surgery.
   METHODS: Patients undergoing elective spine surgery and enrolled into a prospective registry were analyzed. The 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey Mental Component Summary, Zung depression scale, Modified Somatic Perception Questionnaire, and EQ-5D were completed. The anxiety/depression domain of EQ-5D was used to define psychological distress; responses were captured as 1) not anxious or depressed, 2) moderately anxious or depressed, or 3) extremely anxious or depressed. Univariate correlation and proportional odds logistic regression analyses were conducted.
   RESULTS: Of 2470 included patients undergoing elective spine surgery, 45% (n = 1109) reported no psychological distress, 47% (n = 1168) reported moderate psychological distress, and 8% (n = 193) reported extreme psychological distress on EQ-5D. Psychological distress on EQ-5D had positive correlation with Zung depression scale (P < 0.0001, r = 0.620) and Modified Somatic Perception Questionnaire (P < 0.0001, r = 0.450) and negative correlation with 12Item Short-Form Health Survey Mental Component Summary (P < 0.0001, r = 0.662). In proportional odds logistic regression models, EQ-5D psychological distress had significant correlations with 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey Mental Component Summary (P < 0.0001, C-index = 0.831), Zung depression scale (P < 0.0001, C-index = 0.802), and Modified Somatic Perception Questionnaire (P < 0.0001, C-index = 0.711).
   CONCLUSIONS: The anxiety/depression domain of EQ-5D could be used to categorize preoperative psychological distress. Spine registries could use this information to potentially limit the number of validated PROs administered.

AB OBJECTIVE: Based on our clinical experience, posteroinferiorly projecting carotid-A1 junctional aneurysms are often difficult to treat microsurgically. Our objective was to classify peri-internal carotid artery (ICA) bifurcation aneurysms according to their location and analyze their characteristics.
   METHODS: From January 2008 to October 2017, microsurgical or endovascular treatment of 6777 aneurysms were performed at our hospital. We identified 199 peri-ICA bifurcation aneurysms (2.94%) classified into true ICA bifurcation aneurysm, carotid-A1 junctional aneurysm, and carotid-M1 junctional aneurysm according to the anatomic location. Medical records including patient characteristics, aneurysm location, surgical method, any neurologic deficits, clinical outcomes, medical history, and radiologic findings were retrospectively reviewed. The anatomic position of the aneurysm was defined from the virtual surgical, anteroposterior, and lateral views, and the degree of agreement was calculated.
   RESULTS: There were 103 true ICA bifurcation aneurysms, 92 carotid-A1 junctional aneurysms, and 4 carotid-M1 junctional aneurysms. Carotid-A1 junctional aneurysms tended to be smaller, elongated, and more often posteroinferiorly projecting than true ICA bifurcation aneurysms. Posteroinferiorly projecting carotid-A1 junctional aneurysms tended to require complex aneurysm surgery. The virtual surgical view had an almost perfect degree of agreement with the actual surgical view.
   CONCLUSIONS: The characteristics of carotid-A1 junctional aneurysms and true ICA bifurcation aneurysms differ. In particular, carotid-A1 junctional aneurysms tend to have a posteroinferior projection and that causes difficulty in surgical treatment. We recommend the virtual surgical view for preoperative planning. Furthermore, an adequate Sylvian fissure opening and a strategic approach using appropriate devices to inspect blind spots should be considered for a successful treatment outcome..

SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English

DE Curriculum; Neurosurgery residency; Quality improvement
ID MEDICAL-EDUCATION
AB BACKGROUND: Quality Improvement (QI) is essential for improving health care delivery and is now a required component of neurosurgery residency. However, neither a formal curriculum nor implementation strategies have been established by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education.
   METHODS: We describe our experience with implementing a formal QI curriculum, including structured didactics and resident led group-based QI projects. Course materials and didactics were provided by the Mayo Quality Academy. Participants were required to take a 30-question multiple-choice exam to demonstrate basic proficiency in QI methods following completion of didactic. An anonymous survey also was performed to elicit feedback from course participants.
   RESULTS: All of the 40 student participants (17 residents) were able to demonstrate basic proficiency in QI methods on a standardized exam upon course completion. Of the 9 attempted QI projects, 7 were completed, with 5 of those resulting in sustained process changes. The majority of participants felt formal training improved confidence in QI processes and was a valuable professional tool for their careers.
   CONCLUSIONS: A formal didactic curriculum and practical application of QI methodologies adds value to resident training. Further, it has the potential to positively impact practice. Consideration should be given to adopting a formal QI curriculum by other neurosurgery departments and perhaps standardization on national level.

ID REPORTED OUTCOME MEASURES; SURGERY; QUESTIONNAIRE; RISK; PAIN
AB OBJECTIVE: To identify trends in mobility and daily pain levels among a cohort of patients with clinically diagnosed spine disease.
   METHODS: Participants with spine disease were enrolled from a general neurosurgical clinic and installed a smartphone application (Beiwe) designed for digital phenotyping to their personal smartphone. This application collected passive meta-data on a minute-to-minute basis, including global positioning system (GPS), WiFi, accelerometer, text and telephone logs, and screen on and off time. The application also administered daily visual analog scale pain surveys. A linear mixed model framework was used to test for associations between self-reported pain and mobility and sociability from the passively collected data.
   RESULTS: A total of 105 patients were enrolled, with a median follow-up time of 94.5 days; 55 patients underwent a surgical intervention during the follow-up period. The weekly pain survey response rate was 73.2%. By the end of follow-up, the mean change in pain for all patients was -1.3 points (4.96 at the start of follow-up to 3.66 by the end of follow-up). Increased pain was significantly associated with reduced patient mobility as measured using 3 daily GPS summary statistics (i.e., average flight length, maximum diameter travelled, total distance travelled).
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients with spine disease who reported greater pain had reduced mobility, as measured by the passively collected smartphone GPS data. Smartphone-based digital phenotyping appears to be a promising and scalable approach to assess mobility and quality of life of patients with spine disease.

ID INJURY CLASSIFICATION; CORD-INJURY; CHILDREN; FRACTURES; MRI
AB OBJECTIVE: Spine trauma management in children varies from one team to another, and to date, no clear consensus has been reached. The goal of this study was to describe the epidemiology of spine trauma in children and evaluate the timing and techniques of surgery when it was required.
   METHODS: A retrospective review of all patients admitted to our pediatric trauma center for spine traumas that required surgical management, between 2005 and 2016, was performed. All patients were followed with clinical and radiologic examination to evaluate the quality of fusion and realignment.
   RESULTS: Seventy-three children, with a mean age of 14.1 years, were admitted. Spinal injuries were more common in the teenage group (14-18 years). The predominant etiology of spine injuries was motor vehicle collision (36%). The spinal level of injury varied according to the age group: young children presented more cervical traumas (P < 0.01), while teenagers presented more lumbar traumas. There were more fractures alone in the teenage group (P < 0.005), while there were more luxations alone in the school-age group (P < 0.05). Median timing for surgical intervention in patients with neurologic deficits was 1 day. Patients with posterior wall recession >5 mm underwent surgical management quicker than patients with no posterior wall recession (P < 0.03). At follow-up, out of the 37 patients with initial neurologic deficits, 14 had improved (38%).
   CONCLUSIONS: Diskoligament maturation is an essential concept in spine traumas in children, as well as in surgical management. Surgical procedures should be carried out as soon as possible when patients present with neurologic deficits. At the thoracolumbar junction, a 2-level up-and-down fixation is recommended.

AB BACKGROUND: Disorders related to opioid use account for the most substantial burden of disease attributable to drug use disorders. We aimed to justify if there is an association between either opium consumption or addiction and rupture of intracranial aneurysms.
   METHODS: In this case-control study, we enrolled 50 cases with ruptured intracranial aneurysms and 43 control subjects with an incidental finding of an intracranial aneurysm without history of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Four major risk factors of rupture including age, sex, size, and site of aneurysm were matched among both groups. All participants were asked about cigarette smoking state, opium addiction, opium consumption, and duration and route of opium consumption. Eight other trigger factors were assessed in the period soon before SAH (hazard period). The odds ratio (OR) of all factors was calculated separately, and then a logistic regression for the factors with significant odds was calculated.
   RESULTS: Sixty-two percent of cases and 32.6% of control subjects were addicted to opium. The OR for opium consumption in the hazard period was 8.1 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.2-30.1) and for opium addiction was 3.3 (95% CI, 1.4-7.9). Of those trigger factors, cola consumption was included in the logistic regression model. After adjustment, results demonstrated an OR of 9.2 (95% CI, 2.4-34.7) for opium consumption in the hazard period.
   CONCLUSIONS: There is an association between opium addiction and opium consumption in the hazard period with the occurrence of aneurysmal SAH. Replication of the study with a larger sample size and conduction of prospective studies is suggested.

Although this is a rare complication 0.04% to 0.8%, it can be devastating in terms of patient outcome. There are various hypotheses to explain the occurrence of RCH. We report 6 cases of RCH after surgery for supratentorial lesions, discuss the pathophysiology, and review the pertinent literature.
   METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data of patients who underwent surgery for supratentorial lesions at our center between 2015 and 2017. We identified 6 patients who developed RCH among 1200 patients who underwent surgery and reviewed the demographic data, diagnosis, surgical procedure, and final outcome.
   RESULTS: A total of 1200 patients underwent surgery for supratentorial pathologies between 2015 and 2017. Six patients developed RCH (incidence, 0.5%); 5 were male and 1 was female, with a mean age of 46.4 years. One patient underwent suboccipital decompression for RCH; the rest 5 were managed with close observation and serial imaging. The Glasgow outcome scale (GOS) of 5 was observed in 4 patients, GOS of 4 in 1 patient at discharge, and GOS of 1 in 1 patient who succumbed to severe pulmonary infection after surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: RCH is a rare complication but can lead to catastrophic results. Loss of large volumes of cerebrospinal fluid or sudden alteration in intracranial pressure due to removal of a mass lesion is the likely etiology. Although majority of cases may be managed conservatively, in a subset of cases with neurologic deterioration, surgery may be required as a life-saving procedure.

AB BACKGROUND: The globus pallidus internus (Gpi) is a major target in functional neurosurgery. Anatomical studies are crucial for correct planning and good surgical outcomes in this region. The present study described the anatomical coordinates of the Gpi and its relationship with other brain structures and compared the findings with those from previous anatomical studies.
   METHODS: We obtained 35 coronal and 5 horizontal brain specimens from the Department of Anatomy and stained them using the Robert, Barnard, and Brown technique. After excluding defective samples, 60 nuclei were analyzed by assessing their distances to the anatomical references and the trajectories to these nuclei.
   RESULTS: The barycenter of the Gpi was identified at the level of the mammillary bodies and 1 cm above the intercommissural plane. Thereafter, the distances to other structures were found. The mean +/- standard deviation distance was 15.62 +/- 2.66 mm to the wall of the third ventricle and 17.02 +/- 2.69 mm to its midline, 4.74 +/- 1.12 mm to the optic tract, 2.51 +/- 0.8 mm and 13.56 +/- 2 mm to the internal and external capsule, and 21.3 +/- 2.44 mm to the insular cortex. The cortical point of entry should be located 22.03 +/- 4.34 mm to 48.74 +/- 4.44 mm from the midline.
   CONCLUSION: The Gpi has less variability in distance to closer anatomical references, such as the optic tract and internal capsule. Distant locations showed a more inhomogeneous pattern. Anatomical studies such as ours are important for the development of new therapeutic approaches and can be used as a basis for new research involving volumetric and specific group analyses.

DE Anatomy; AOI; Asymptomatic Nigerian adults; Craniocervical junction
ID ATLANTOAXIAL SUBLUXATION; CRANIOCERVICAL JUNCTION
AB BACKGROUND: Imaging of the craniocervical junction (CCJ) after trauma is crucial for injury detection and description. Of all the anatomic measurements of the CCJ, the normal value of atlanto-occipital interval (AOI) is not yet well established in adults. The aim of our study is to determine the normal values of the AOI in Nigerians aged between 21 and 60 years using multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) scan and to determine racial, age, and sex differences.
   METHODS: This was a prospective observational study done at Memfys Hospital for Neurosurgery, Enugu, Nigeria, between May 2016 and April 2017. There were 240 subjects (120 men and 120 women) divided into the following age groups: 21-30, 31-40, 41-50, and 51-60 years. Non-Nigerians and those with preexisting CCJ abnormalities were excluded. Normal values were those within the 95% confidence interval. Results were analyzed for possible sex and age variations and compared with the available literature for racial differences. Ethical approval was obtained for this study.
   RESULTS: The measured normal computed tomography value of the AOI in adult Nigerians was 1.181 +/- 0.018 mm. The values in the age groups of 21-30, 31-40, 41-50, and 51-60 years were 1.279 +/- 0.038, 1.164 +/- 0.033, 1.151 +/- 0.029, and 1.133 +/- 0.033 mm, respectively (P < 0.05). The average normal values in men and women were 1.188 +/- 0.025 and 1.174 +/- 0.026 mm, respectively. The interobserver reliability test using the Cronbach alpha was 0.938.
   CONCLUSIONS: AOI values in this study were higher than previous MDCT-based values in non-African populations. The AOI decreased linearly with age and did not show any sex difference.

AB BACKGROUND: Surgeries for deep and eloquent cerebral lesions require a detailed knowledge of normal brain anatomy and accurate planning. Important parts of brain anatomy are the cerebral blood supply and collateral circulation system. In addition to well-known cortical and basal (circle of Willis) anastomoses, there is also a deep interarterial anastomotic circle that is not described in the literature.
   METHODS: Twenty brain specimens were studied for deep arterial anastomotic connections between branches of the anterior and posterior choroidal arteries.
   RESULTS: We have marked 3 symmetric zones of deep arterial anastomoses that form an epithalamic circle.
   CONCLUSIONS: Epithalamic anastomoses provide an additional mechanism of blood distribution that may play a role during surgical interventions or stroke.

AB OBJECTIVE: To clarify safety and efficacy of stent-assisted coiling for treatment of blood blisterelike aneurysm (BBA) in a multicenter experience.
   METHODS: A total of 212 consecutive cases (213 BBAs) treated with stent-assisted coiling were retrospectively reviewed and included in the final analysis. Outcomes including complete occlusion, recurrence, perioperative morbidity and mortality, and overall good neurologic outcome during follow-up were analyzed.
   RESULTS: Of 212 patients, 102 (48.1%) were treated with a single stent, 77 (36.3%) were treated with 2 stents, and 33 (15.6%) were treated with >= 3 stents. Angiographic follow-up data were available for 96 BBAs; 64.6% of BBAs showed complete obliteration, and 22.9% showed recurrence. Complete obliteration rates of patients treated with single, 2, and >= 3 stents were 42.9%, 78.4%, and 88.2%. Recurrence rates of patients treated with single, 2, and >= 3 stents were 38.1%, 13.5%, and 5.9%. Using >= 2 stents seemed to result in higher obliteration rates (P < 0.001) and lower recurrence rates (P = 0.002). Clinical follow-up data available for 180 patients showed 91.1% of patients had a good clinical outcome. No difference was found between the 3 stent treatments. There were 14 (6.6%) perioperative ischemic complications and 12 (5.7%) hemorrhagic complications, with 10 (4.7%) cases of perioperative deaths. Using >= 2 stents seemed to result in a lower perioperative hemorrhagic complication rate compared with single stent (P = 0.037).
   CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the use of overlapping (>= 2) stents combined with coiling as a safe and effective therapeutic modality for BBA. Overlapping (>= 2) stents may provide higher obliteration rate, lower recurrence rate, and lower perioperative hemorrhagic risk in treatment of BBA.

ID ENDONASAL SURGERY; ADENOMAS; EXPERIENCE; VISION
AB BACKGROUND: With the advent of extensive endoscopic approaches for pituitary tumors, there has also been an increase in surgery for larger and more complex tumors. Intraoperative manipulation during endoscopic resection of sellar tumors poses potential risk in postoperative visual function in this tumor population. This study proposes a method of accurate intraoperative monitoring of visual evoked potentials (VEPs) and its role in predicting visual function outcomes.
   METHODS: Intraoperative VEPs were monitored for 42 resections from a single surgical team, with average tumor size of 2.84 cm. Changes in VEP amplitude and latency in excess of 50% were considered significant. Preoperative and postoperative visual information was obtained from ophthalmology and hospital records, along with patient demographics, comorbidities, and tumor characteristics.
   RESULTS: Patients were stratified as experiencing deteriorations in VEPs that did not restore to baseline (n = 4), deteriorations in VEPs that did restore to baseline (n = 6), no change in VEPs (n = 31), and improvement in VEPs (n = 1). Correlation between VEP changes and postoperative visual fields was measured through univariate ordered logistic regression. Improved intraoperative VEP measurements were associated with odds ratio (OR) of visual field improvement of 3.15 (95% confidence interval, 1.15-8.59). Specifically, changes in VEP amplitude were positively associated with visual field improvement with OR of 4.35 (OR, 1.29-14.7). No association was observed between VEPs and other patient or tumor characteristics.
   CONCLUSION: Changes in VEP amplitude during endoscopic sellar tumor resection correlate with postoperative visual function. Intraoperative VEP monitoring can serve an important role in preventing postoperative visual field loss.

AB BACKGROUND: The armamentarium for anterior skull base (ASB) reconstruction includes a variegate spectrum of grafts, endonasal pedicled flaps, regional pedicled flaps, and free flaps, which are selected to face specific scenarios. The use of a vascularized flap in case of large ABS defects ensures an adequate blood supply. The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible role of temporoparietal fascia flap (TPFF) in ASB reconstruction.
   METHODS: Eight fresh-frozen head specimens were dissected to evaluate the adequacy of TPFF and pericranial flap (PF) for the reconstruction of ASB defects. The percentage of coverage of the ASB was calculated for TPFF and PF. An anatomic-radiologic analysis was performed to provide useful practical information for flap harvesting and positioning.
   RESULTS: The TPFF was easily transposed to the ABS defect through an epidural corridor; the edges of the TPFF were successfully placed in the intradural space, in the epidural space, or on the extracranial surface of the ABS defect. The PF was particularly adequate for median defects, and the TPFF was shown to be useful also in cases with paramedian-supraorbital extension. The median percentage of coverage of the ASB was significantly higher for TPFF (85.1%) than PF (65.7%) (P = 0.018).
   CONCLUSIONS: The supraorbital epidural corridor is a possible novel pathway for transposition of the TPFF for ASB reconstruction. Side-door TPFF was shown to be an ideal choice for large ASB defect with lateral supraorbital extension and could be useful in the scenario of salvage reconstruction for recurrent ABS cerebrospinal fluid leak.

TI Clinical Outcome of Radiating Multiple Subpial Transections Alone for
   Drug Resistant Epilepsy After More Than 5 Years Follow-Up
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Drug resistant epilepsy surgery; MST; Multiple subpial transections
AB OBJECTIVE: Multiple subpial transection (MST) is a possible surgical treatment for patients with epileptogenic foci located in eloquent cortical areas. Commonly, it is performed in addition to other surgical techniques. In some cases, however, it is performed alone. We report the clinical results of 12 patients who received solely radiating MST with a minimal follow-up of 5 years.
   METHODS: All patients who underwent a surgical intervention between 2003 and 2012 for refractory epilepsy were studied. Among them, 12 had radiating MST (rMST) as the only surgical treatment with a follow-up of at least 5 years.
   RESULTS: At 5-year follow-up, 50% of the patients were Engel class I, 25% were Engel class II, 0% were Engel class III, and 25% were Engel class IV. At last follow-up, 8 patients (67%) were free of seizures, 1 patient (8%) had an over 75% decrease, and 3 patients (25%) did not improve after the procedure. None of the Engel I patients had seizure recurrence, and those belonging to an intermediate class improved during follow-up, in some cases in association with an antiepileptic drug modification. Two patients (17%) had a minor transient complication, and 1 patient (8%) had a minor permanent complication.
   CONCLUSIONS: rMST performed alone gives a favorable outcome in 75% of the patients at a minimum 5-year follow-up with few minor complications. This procedure appears to be effective even with a prolonged follow-up in drug resistant epilepsy with the epileptogenic foci located in eloquent areas.

DE Awake craniotomy; Functional mapping; Functional monitoring; Glioma;
   Intraoperative examination; Language area
ID RESECTION; TUMORS
AB BACKGROUND: When brain tumors are located near the language area, a test to assess language function is required. During the test, it is practical to display combined information obtained from all the equipment so that the surgeon can confirm the patient's response to the tasks. We developed the intraoperative examination monitor for awake surgery (IEMAS) mainly to combine all information so that the language function test could be performed efficiently. The IEMAS has proved to be useful in clinical settings; however, no quantitative evaluation has been performed. This study aimed to demonstrate the clinical usefulness of the IEMAS through comparison of cases with and without IEMAS use in language function test simulation.
   METHODS: The language function test simulator was created to eliminate any uncertain factors, such as symptoms, which vary among patients. Neurosurgeons participated in the test, and the usefulness of the IEMAS was investigated. We analyzed test duration and number of information exchanges between surgeon and examiner.
   RESULTS: Total test duration with IEMAS use was significantly shorter than without IEMAS use (116.1 +/- 23.1 seconds vs. 147.8 +/- 48.7 seconds; P < 0.02). The number of information exchanges between surgeon and examiner was significantly lower with IEMAS use than without IEMAS use (0.2 +/- 0.6 times vs. 16.1 +/- 15.6 times; P < 0.02).
   CONCLUSIONS: We compared cases with and without IEMAS use. Total test duration decreased with IEMAS use, and number of information exchanges was reduced, thus demonstrating the usefulness of the IEMAS.

DT Article
DE Aneurysmal stenting; Anterior communicating artery; Progressive

ID ENDOVASCULAR TREATMENT; INTRACRANIAL ANEURYSMS
AB BACKGROUND: Stent-assisted coil embolization (SAC) for treating anterior communicating artery (AcomA) aneurysms is safe and effective. Straightening of parent vessels by stent placement can lead to progressive thrombosis. We describe our experience with SAC for AcomA aneurysms and demonstrate the effect of straightening the parent vessels.
   METHODS: A total of 26 patients with AcomA aneurysms were treated using SAC in our institute between July 2010 and December 2017. Follow-up digital subtraction angiography was performed 6 months after treatment, magnetic resonance angiography was performed every year, and outcomes were analyzed.
   RESULTS: From all aneurysms (n = 24), 12 (50.0%) were neck remnant, and 12 (50.0%) were dome-filling types immediately after the procedure. At the 6-month digital subtraction angiography follow-up (n = 22), 13 (59.1%) aneurysms were complete obliteration, 8 (36.4%) were neck remnant, and 1 (4.5%) was dome filling. The median parent vessel anglewas measured preoperatively at 98.1 degrees, increased to 124.8 degrees immediately after stent deployment, and further increased to 149.6 degrees at the 6-month follow-up. Progressive thrombosis was observed in 13 of 22 (59.1%) aneurysms. The parent vessel angle change immediately after stent deployment in the progressive thrombosis group tended to be larger than that observed in the no thrombosis group; this change was significant at the 6-month follow-up. The median followup term was 18 months. No patients required retreatment.
   CONCLUSIONS: Good SAC outcomes were achieved for AcomA aneurysms, and hemodynamic changes related to straightening of the parent vessels is a consideration in SAC.

TI How Does Cage Lordosis Influence Postoperative Segmental Lordosis in
   Lumbar Interbody Fusion
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Fusion; Lordosis; Lumbar; Segmental
ID SAGITTAL BALANCE; ALIGNMENT; RESTORATION; MANAGEMENT; DEFORMITY; SURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: Consideration of sagittal alignment is an integral part of spinal fusion surgery correlating with superior outcomes. Segmental lordosis is an important contributor to sagittal alignment. This study assessed surgical factors influencing segmental lordosis in a 360 degrees fusion model, including cage dimensions, anterior longitudinal ligament resection, facetectomy, and posterior compression.
   METHODS: Six L3-4 synthetic spinal motion segments were used in a repeated measures design. Each sample was sequentially instrumented with lateral cages of increasing height and angle. Lordosis was assessed from lateral radiographs of intact and each instrumented condition. The effect of anterior longitudinal ligament resection, posterior compression with pedicle screws, and bilateral facetectomy was additionally examined.
   RESULTS: A linear relationship between segmental lordosis and cage height was found. This effect was greater with the anterior longitudinal ligament divided. In cages of the same anterior height, increased intrinsic cage lordosis did not result in increased segmental lordosis; cages with no intrinsic lordosis resulted in the highest segmental lordosis. In examining this finding, it was shown that posterior cage height had a larger influence on segmental lordosis. Posterior compression with pedicle screws and bilateral facetectomy increased the segmental lordosis by a further 3.4 degrees and 2.6 degrees, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: Cage height was a key factor, with posterior compression further increasing lordosis. The finding that 0 degrees cages results in the most segmental lordosis was an unexpected finding and highlights the importance of appropriate sizing on resulting lordosis. These findings are relevant to cage selection but require further study prior to applying to clinical practice and may influence future cage design.

ID NERVE ANASTOMOSIS; HYPOGLOSSAL
AB OBJECTIVE: Neurorrhaphy with interpositional graft is a practical technique to achieve facial reanimation when the continuity of the facial nerve is interrupted and a large gap between the proximal and distal stump exists. The aim of this study was to report long-term outcomes of neurorrhaphy for facial reanimation with interpositional graft. The roles of some variable factors in the outcome of neurorrhaphy with interpositional graft were also evaluated and compared.
   METHODS: A retrospective case series from a single tertiary referral center comprised 23 patients with facial nerve interruptions who underwent neurorrhaphy with interpositional graft using either end-to-end anastomosis or end-to-side hypoglossal-facial technique. Preoperative data (age, sex, primary lesion, interval from paralysis to surgery, facial nerve function), intraoperative data (surgical approach, graft and type of neurorrhaphy), and postoperative data (facial nerve function) were collected and analyzed.
   RESULTS: Mean follow-up time was 26.6 +/- 11.9 months. Patients who underwent neurorrhaphy for facial reanimation within 1 year after onset of facial paralysis were more likely to achieve House-Brackmann grade <= 3 compared with patients who underwent neurorrhaphy >1 year after onset of facial paralysis (odds ratio = 23.85, P = 0.04). No other factors were associated with improved outcomes.
   CONCLUSIONS: Early neurorrhaphy with interpositional graft (<= 1 year) for facial reanimation resulted in better final facial nerve function outcomes compared with a delayed procedure.

TI Differential Patterns of Referral to Neurosurgery: A Comparison of

SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Neurosurgery; Nurse; Physician; Referral; Surgery
ID EDUCATION; CARE
AB BACKGROUND: Rising cost and limited resources remain major challenges to U.S. health care and neurosurgery in particular. To ensure an efficient and cost-effective health care system, it is important that referrals to neurosurgery clinics are appropriate, and that referred patients have a reasonably high probability of requiring surgical intervention or, at a minimum, ongoing neurosurgical follow-up. This retrospective study tests the null hypothesis that the probability of a referred patient requiring surgery is independent of referring provider credentials and referring service specialty.
   METHODS: A database of all patients referred to the neurosurgery clinic from 2015 through 2018 (n = 5677) was reviewed; the database included referring provider, referring provider specialty, number of subsequent clinic visits, and outcome of surgery or no surgery. Associations between categorical variables were tested using a chi(2) analysis with post hoc relative risk (RR) calculations and binary logistical regression.
   RESULTS: Compared with patients referred by allopathic physicians, patients referred by osteopathic physicians (RR, 0.63; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.48-0.84) and those referred by nurse practitioners (RR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.51-0.86) were significantly less likely to require surgery. Probability of surgical intervention also varied by referrer specialty. Patients referred by neurologists required surgery 35% of the time, whereas patients referred by family practitioners required surgery 19% of the time, and patients referred by pediatricians required surgery only 7% of the time (P < 0.01). Binary logistic regression revealed that referrals from nurse practitioners and osteopathic physicians were independently associated with a decreased probability of surgical intervention.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our data strengthen the concept of having interdisciplinary teams led by physicians at the primary care level to ensure appropriate referrals. Training and adherence to guidelines must continually be reinforced to ensure proper referrals.

AB OBJECTIVE: The Derivo Embolization Device (DED) is a novel flow-diverter stent consisting of a flexible structure and a surface modification that aims to reduce thrombogenicity. Here, we report 1-year clinical and angiographic follow-up results of the second-generation DED for the treatment of intracranial aneurysms.
   METHODS: This is a retrospective study of 59 consecutive patients (mean age: 53 years, 81% women) treated with the DED for 59 aneurysms (mean size: 8.1 mm) between November 2015 and February 2018 at 3 German tertiary care centers. We evaluated the rate of ischemic stroke, functional outcome, and angiographic results during a 1-year follow-up period.
   RESULTS: Deployment of the DED was successful in all cases. Adverse events were observed in 6 procedures (10.2%), of which 2 were symptomatic (3.4%). No delayed ischemic or hemorrhagic events occurred during the 1-year follow-up and there were no deaths. Permanent morbidity due to in-stent thrombosis and consecutive ischemic stroke occurred in 1 patient (1.7%). Complete (O'Kelly-Marotta grading scale D) and favorable (O'Kelly-Marotta grading scale C+D) aneurysm occlusion was obtained in 70.5% (31/44) and 88.7% (39/44) at 6 months and 82.8% (24/29) and 100% (29/29) at 12 months, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that treatment of intracranial aneurysms with the DED is associated with low rates of ischemic complications and adequate aneurysm occlusion at 1-year follow-up.

AB OBJECTIVE: Woven Endobridge (WEB) embolization is an approved technique for endovascular treatment of wide-necked and bifurcation aneurysms. However, the WEB has not yet been routinely used for internal carotid artery (ICA) sidewall aneurysms. In this multicenter study, we evaluate the safety and efficacy of WEB for treatment of these aneurysms.
   METHODS: We reviewed all patients with ICA sidewall aneurysms who were treated with WEB at 3 German neurovascular centers between 2011 and 2018. Technical success, complication rates, and angiographic outcome were retrospectively assessed.
   RESULTS: Twenty patients (mean age, 56.3 +/- 13.0 years) with 20 ICA aneurysms (6 ruptured) were identified. The aneurysms were located at the paraophthalmic segment (n = 10), the posterior communicating artery segment (n = 9), and the anterior choroidal artery segment (n = 1). The mean aneurysm size was 8.1 +/- 5.2 mm and 60% were wide-necked. The aneurysms were treated with a single WEB (n = 11) or in combination with coiling and/or stent implantation (n = 7). WEB implantation failed in 2 aneurysms because of a sharp aneurysm angle. There were 1 periprocedural thromboembolic event and 1 in-stent stenosis at follow-up, which remained asymptomatic in both cases. There was no procedure-related morbidity and mortality. At follow-up, complete occlusion was achieved in 76.5%, neck remnants in 17.6%, and aneurysms remnants in 5.9%.
   CONCLUSIONS: The WEB device can be used for treatment of ICA sidewall aneurysms with a high level of procedural safety and a high degree of technical success.

AB BACKGROUND: Intracranial solitary fibrous tumors (ISFTs) are rare mesenchymal neoplasms originating in the meninges and characterized by very different biologic and clinical behaviors. Benign histotypes, such as hemangiopericytomas, are now considered a cellular phenotypic variant of this heterogeneous group of rare spindle-cell tumors. Owing to their rarity and resemblance to other, more common brain tumors, ISFTs are often poorly recognized and remain a diagnostic challenge.
   METHODS: We describe a surgical series of 29 patients treated for ISFTs confirmed histologically and through immunohistochemistry. We attempt to provide a focus on the natural history of these pathologies and the need for tailored management.
   RESULTS: This was a retrospective consecutive series of 29 patients with either solitary fibrous tumor (n = 14) or hemangiopericytoma (n = 15) over a 10-year period. Mean follow-up time was 37.71 months. Recurrence rate was 42.9% for solitary fibrous tumors versus 26.7% for hemangiopericytomas. STAT6 expression was 66.7% in hemangiopericytomas versus 42.9% in SFTs.
   CONCLUSIONS: Histopathology and immunohistochemical staining (characterized by positive expression of mainly STAT6 but also CD34, Bcl-2 protein, and vimentin) are key in diagnosis and management of ISFTs. Although ISFTs are still considered benign lesions with very rare aggressive evolution, their clinical behavior is largely unpredictable. This study highlights the importance of relying on immunohistochemistry for a thorough definition of the management strategy.

TI Osseous Remodeling Technique of the Sella Turcica: A New Surgical Option
   for Primary Empty Sella Syndrome

LA English
DT Article
DE Chiasmapexy; Empty sella syndrome; Sella turcica; Sellar arachnoidocele;
   Transsphenoidal surgery
ID TRANSSPHENOIDAL TREATMENT; CHIASMAPEXY
AB BACKGROUND: Empty sella is an anatomic finding that is usually asymptomatic. However, when patients with empty sella finding present with visual deficits, surgical treatment may be necessary. The main goal of surgery is to elevate sellar content through a transsphenoidal approach. The aim of this study was to demonstrate a new technique for precise reconstruction of the sellar floor using a heterologous bone block to restore the anatomic elements of the sella turcica.
   METHODS: Three patients with primary empty sella who presented with visual field defects were prospectively included. Surgery was performed through a microsurgical transsphenoidal approach and involved elevating the sellar content by using a tricortical heterologous bone graft, the dimensions of which were obtained considering the exact dimensions of each patient's sella turcica. The graft was premodeled outside the surgical bed and carefully introduced into the sella turcica to achieve the required elevation (chiasmapexy).
   RESULTS: Vision of all 3 patients improved, and the improvement persisted throughout the follow-up period. 2 patients, this improvement was noted immediately after surgery, and in the third patient, this change in vision occurred 1 week later. Long-term imaging studies showed the persistence of the bone graft in the sella turcica and the exact elevation of the sellar content at the end of the follow-up period. There were no complications in the present series.
   CONCLUSIONS: The technique presented here is simple and reproducible and allows an almost exact and persistent elevation of the sellar content.

AB OBJECTIVE: To study whether and when mere dorsal decompression is enough in the full endoscopic key hole technique for foraminal stenosis.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed a total of 22 patients with cervical foraminal stenosis who underwent full endoscopic key hole mere dorsal decompression in our institute from October 2016 to October 2017.
   RESULTS: Preoperative neck disability index, neck visual analog scale score, and arm visual analog scale score were 25.8 +/- 0.8, 4.9 +/- 0.6, and 7.5 +/- 0.5 in the group. Immediate postoperative scores were 6.9 +/- 0.9, 1.3 +/- 0.9, and 1.4 +/- 0.5. Follow-up scores at 3 months (7.0 +/- 0.9, 1.9 +/- 0.6, and 2.7 +/- 0.9), 6 months (7.3 +/- 0.9, 2.1 +/- 0.9, and 1.9 +/- 0.5), and 12 months (7.6 +/- 0.5, 2.5 +/- 0.8, and 2.1 +/- 0.7). The symptoms had improved significantly (P < 0.05). According to the Macnab criteria, 15 patients reported excellent results, 2 reported good results, and 2 reported fair results at the 12-month follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: Stenosis is mainly caused by dorsal structures; mere dorsal decompression is enough. In both cases, the ventral and dorsal structures contributed to the stenosis. When there is no herniated soft fragment contributing to the stenosis, ventral decompression is not always necessary. If intraoperative exploration detects less tension formed by the ventral abnormal structures, mere dorsal decompression is enough to settle the symptoms.

TI Natural History of Intracranial Arachnoid Cysts

LA English
DT Article
DE Arachnoid cyst; Congenital abnormality
ID ENDOSCOPIC TREATMENT; INCIDENTAL FINDINGS; PREVALENCE; FEATURES;
   CHILDREN
AB BACKGROUND: Intracranial arachnoid cysts are a common incidental finding. Most of these remain asymptomatic with surgical intervention being reserved for those cysts causing symptoms from mass effect or hydrocephalus. It is not properly understood why cysts enlarge nor is it possible to predict in which cysts this will occur. The aim of this study is to review the natural history of incidental arachnoid cysts.
   METHODS: A retrospective case review was conducted of all patients diagnosed with an arachnoid cyst between 2007 and 2016. Case notes and radiology reports were reviewed for demographics, symptoms, and changes in cyst sizes.
   RESULTS: Four hundred and eighty-five patients were diagnosed with an arachnoid cyst during this time period; of these, 425 (87.6%) were asymptomatic. Patients with symptomatic cysts were significantly younger and more likely to have associated hydrocephalus. The most common indications for imaging which resulted in the diagnosis of the cyst were headaches (n = 106), stroke (n = 51), and seizures (n = 41). The cyst size remained stable or reduced in 147 patients (99.3%) with follow-up imaging (n = 148), and the enlarging cyst remained asymptomatic.
   CONCLUSIONS: Asymptomatic arachnoid cysts have a low rate of cyst enlargement on follow-up imaging, which supports not routinely imaging these patients. However, serial imaging and surgery may still be indicated in asymptomatic patients at risk of obstructive hydrocephalus which, in this series, was only seen in the pediatric population. A better understanding of the natural history of intracranial arachnoid cysts allows for more efficient follow-up planning.

AB BACKGROUND: Wrap-clipping is one of the recommended treatments for ruptured blood blister-like aneurysms (BBAs) of the internal carotid artery (ICA). However, the long-term clinical and angiographic outcomes of this procedure have not yet been elucidated. The present study examined the long-term efficacy of wrap-clipping using a polytetrafluoroethylene membrane, an ideal wrapping material, for BBAs.
   METHODS: The data from 9 patients with ruptured BBAs treated at our institutes from 2007 to 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. Wrap-clipping was performed with advanced monitoring techniques, including fluorescence video angiography and endoscopy. Angiographic follow-up was achieved using 3-dimensional computed tomography angiography or digital subtraction angiography. Clinical outcomes were assessed using the modified Rankin scale.
   RESULTS: Wrap-clipping was performed without any permanent morbidity in all patients. Endoscopy visualized accurate margins of the aneurysmal pathological wall with high magnification and revealed the position of the clip blades and the surrounding perforators in the dead angles of the microscope. Fluorescence video angiography could confirm the blood flow of the ICA and the surrounding arteries. Regrowth of the aneurysm owing to the presence of a neck remnant occurred 1 month after treatment in 1 case that was repaired surgically. However, no other recurrence of BBAs or progression of ICA stenosis was observed by angiography with a mean follow-up period of 37 months. No repeat rupture or ischemic complications occurred, and all patients had a modified Rankin scale score of 0 with a mean follow-up period of 61 months.
   CONCLUSION: Wrap-clipping using a polytetrafluoroethylene membrane for ruptured BBAs is a useful and acceptable procedure with long-term effectiveness. The effectiveness of this method can be ensured using modern monitoring methods.

ID TERM-FOLLOW-UP; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; NUCLEUS; EFFICACY; SAFETY; TRIAL
AB BACKGROUND: The predominant neurosurgical approach to medication-refractory essential tremor is thalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS). The emergence of magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) thalamotomy has reawakened the debate surrounding the use of DBS versus thalamotomy for this indication. Herein, we aimed to provide a contemporary comparison between DBS and MRgFUS.
   METHODS: Two controlled trials that evaluated DBS and MRgFUS for the unilateral treatment of refractory essential tremor were compared. Clinical outcomes extracted included postural tremor score in the treated upper extremity, quality of life (QoL), and incidence of adverse events (AE).
   RESULTS: Baseline patient characteristics were comparable in the 2 studies, except that DBS patients were younger and had more severe baseline tremor. Both DBS- and MRgFUS-treated patients had significant tremor improvement that was sustained for 1-year posttreatment, and significant improvement in QoL. The MRgFUS cohort had higher rates of persistent neurologic AE, whereas the DBS group had higher rates of surgery- and hardware-related AEs, including intracranial hemorrhage.
   CONCLUSIONS: In context of prior literature, both DBS and MRgFUS significantly improve tremor control and QoL. The 2 approaches are predominantly differentiated by their AE-profile. Additional head-to-head comparison on matched clinical populations are required to more accurately compare clinical efficacy and long-term outcomes.

AB OBJECTIVE: Long-term data about the incidence of late adverse radiation effects (AREs) in pediatric brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) are lacking. This study addresses the incidence of late AREs, including cyst formation (CF), chronic encapsulated hematoma (CEH), and radiation-induced tumor, in pediatric patients with AVM treated with GKRS.
   METHODS: This is a single-institutional study involving pediatric patients with AVM who underwent GKRS between 1991 and 2014. Among 201 pediatric patients with AVM (age <= 15 years), 189 who had at least 12 months of follow-up were assessed in this study. The median treatment volume was 2.2 cm(3), and the median marginal dose was 20 Gy.
   RESULTS: The mean follow-up period was 136 months. During the follow-up period, symptomatic radiation-induced perilesional edema was found in 5 patients (3%), CFs in 7 patients (4%), CEHs in 7 patients (4%), and radiation-induced tumors in 2 patients (1%). The cumulative incidences of late AREs including CF, CEH, and radiation-induced tumor were 1.2% at 5 years, 5.2% at 8 years, 6.1% at 10 years, 7.2% at 15 years, and 17.0% at 20 years. In the multivariate analysis, treatment volume alone was a significant factor for late AREs (P < 0.001; hazard ratio, 1.111).
   CONCLUSIONS: GKRS is a reasonable treatment option for pediatric AVMs to prevent future intracranial hemorrhages, particularly in the eloquent regions. However, considerable attention should be paid to late AREs such as CFs, CEHs, and radiation-induced tumors because of longer life expectancy in pediatric patients.

AB OBJECTIVE: Little is known about long-term outcomes for pediatric brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS). This study investigated annual hemorrhage rates and nidus obliteration rates, and the factors affecting them, in pediatric AVMs treated with GKRS.
   METHODS: We examined 189 pediatric AVM patients (age <= 15 years) who underwent GKRS and had at least 12 months of follow-up. The Spetzler-Martin (S-M) grade was I in 29 patients (15%), II in 57 (30%), III in 82 (43%), IV in 16 (9%), and V in 5 (3%). The median treatment volume was 2.2 cm(3), and the median marginal dose was 20 Gy.
   RESULTS: The mean follow-up period was 136 months. During a cumulative latency period to nidus obliteration of 813 years, 23 hemorrhages occurred, resulting in an annual post-GKRS hemorrhage rate of 2.8%. The cumulative hemorrhage rates after GKRS were 3.3%, 8.5%, and 11.9% at 3, 5, and 10 years, respectively. Higher S-M grade was significantly associated with intracranial hemorrhages during the latency period (P < 0.001). The actuarial nidus obliteration rates with repeated GKRS were 64% and 81% at 5 and 10 years, respectively. Absence of pre-GKRS embolization (P = 0.023) and higher marginal dose (P = 0.029) were significant factors predicting nidus obliteration.
   CONCLUSIONS: GKRS is a reasonable treatment option in pediatric AVMs to prevent future hemorrhages. Because higher S-M grade AVMs are more likely to hemorrhage during the latency period, a combined therapy with endovascular embolization should be considered to prevent AVM rupture.

TI Endoscopic Hematoma Evacuation for Intracerebral Hemorrhage Under Local
   Anesthesia: Factors That Affect the Hematoma Removal Rate
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Endoscopic removal; Hemodialysis; Hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage;
   Liver cirrhosis; Removal rate
ID INTRACRANIAL HEMORRHAGE; SURGERY
AB OBJECTIVE: Recent advances in endoscopic surgery have led to more patients being able to undergo endoscopic removal of hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage (HICH). However, because of the minimal invasiveness, endoscopic HICH removal through a narrow surgical window can result in a low removal rate. The goal of the present study was to investigate the factors that affect the removal rate of HICH evacuation.
   METHODS: The data from 28 patients with supratentorial HICH who had undergone endoscopic hematoma evacuation were retrospectively analyzed. The inclusion criteria were spontaneous supratentorial HICH with a hematoma volume >30 mL, admission to the hospital within 24 hours of ictus, and a Glasgow coma scale score of >= 4.
   RESULTS: Of the 28 patients, 9 were women and 19 were men, ranging in age from 41 to 86 years (mean, 60.7 +/- 12.7). The hematoma location was the basal ganglia in 25 patients and subcortical in 3 patients. The mean preoperative hematoma volume was 62.4 +/- 22.5 mL. The hematoma removal rate was <60% for 11 patients (poor evacuation group) and >= 60% for in 17 patients (good evacuation group). Comparing the 2 groups, chronic renal failure treated with hemodialysis (P = 0.0072, chi(2) test), liver cirrhosis (P = 0.023, chi(2) test), and surgeon experience with >= 10 cases of endoscopic HICH removal (P = 0.016, chi(2) test) were significant factors related to the HICH removal rate.
   CONCLUSION: To achieve a good removal rate, surgeons should have experience performing the endoscopic procedure. Also, patients with end-stage chronic renal failure or liver cirrhosis should be excluded.

   APOPLEXY; HEADACHE; OUTCOMES
AB BACKGROUND: Rathke cleft cysts (RCCs) arise from the remnant of Rathke pouch and are usually found in the intermediate lobe. In most cases, RCCs remain intrasellar and extend into the suprasellar region. Rarely, they emerge entirely into the suprasellar cistern-entirely suprasellar Rathke cleft cyst (ESSRCC).
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed medical records of 7 patients (5.5%) with ESSRCC among 128 patients with a diagnosis of RCC from January 1994 to September 2018. Of RCC cases, 70 were treated surgically. Patient age and sex, symptoms, magnetic resonance imaging findings, cyst diameter, presence of preoperative or postoperative hypopituitarism, operative procedures and complications, and functional outcomes at the final follow-up were investigated.
   RESULTS: All patients with ESSRCC were women with mean age 45.7 years (range, 29-69 years) at diagnosis. All patients experienced headache, mainly in the retro-orbital region. Mean ESSRCC diameter was 9.9 mm (range, 6-14 mm). Most cases exhibited hyperintensity on both T1-weighted and T2-weighted imaging. The endoscopic endonasal transtuberculum sellae approach relieved headache effectively and safely in 5 patients. Postoperative endocrinologic functions were almost entirely preserved. No patient experienced recurrence during the follow-up period.
   CONCLUSIONS: RCCs should be considered in the differential diagnosis of suprasellar cysts. The endoscopic endonasal transtuberculum sellae approach has an advantage in visualizing these lesions owing to the direction of light from the endoscope. Headache could be treated effectively with the endoscopic endonasal transtuberculum sellae approach without recurrence of cysts or pituitary dysfunction.

AB BACKGROUND: Atlantoaxial instability (AAI) is a common cause of neurologic dysfunction and pain in patients with Down syndrome (DS), frequently requiring instrumented fusion of the upper cervical spine. Despite this, optimal treatment strategy is controversial.
   METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systemic Reviews and Meta-Analysis statement to identify patients with AAI and DS were treated with upper cervical spine fusion. Patient demographics, preoperative symptoms, fixation type, and outcome measures including complications, neurologic outcomes, and bony fusion status were gathered for patients in the included publications. Meta-analysis was performed to compare outcomes of different types of fixation constructs.
   RESULTS: Of the 1191 publications retrieved, 51 met inclusion criteria, yielding 137 patients. Six fixation strategies were identified: noninstrumented (n = 6), wiring (n = 77), wiring with rods (n = 14), screw fixation (n = 33), hook and rod fixation (n = 2), and screw and wire fixation (n = 5). Constructs with screws and rods had greater bony union (P = 0.003) and a lower rate of revision surgery (P = 0.047), loss of reduction or pseudoarthrosis (P = 0.009), halo utilization (P < 0.001), and early neurologic decline (P = 0.004) compared with wiring alone. Constructs with wires and rods had greater bony union (P = 0.036) than wiring alone.
   CONCLUSIONS: Numerous fixation strategies exist for AAI in patients with DS. Using a combination of screws, rods, and wiring in appropriately selected patients may help reduce the high rate of surgical complications in these patients.

AB OBJECTIVE: Pituitary apoplexy is a rare but potentially life-threatening disorder that occurs in up to 10% of adenomas. Whereas risk factors for the initial hemorrhagic event are well described, there is minor knowledge on clinical symptomatic recurrent pituitary apoplexies.
   METHODS: At the Medical University of Vienna, 76 patients were surgically treated for clinical symptomatic pituitary apoplexy between 1990 and 2017. Four patients (5.3%) suffered multiple pituitary apoplexies after initial surgery. In this retrospective study, neuroradiologic images, clinical data, and intraoperative findings were reviewed for potential risk factors of multiple apoplexies in pituitary adenomas.
   RESULTS: Patients with multiple apoplexies had significantly higher Knosp grading on preoperative imaging (median grade 4), and more frequently observed cavernous sinus invasion intraoperatively (P = 0.01). Consequently, all cases with multiple pituitary apoplexies remained with residual adenoma postoperatively. In cases of residual tumor within the cavernous sinus, recurrent apoplexy occurred in 23.5% of patients. A tumor recurrence/residual was resected significantly earlier in patients with single apoplexy (median 2.2 years) than in patients with multiple apoplexies (median 5.4 years; P = 0.05). Multiple pituitary apoplexies caused significantly greater rates of ophthalmoplegia (75% vs. 14.1%; P = 0.01) and long-term hormone-replacement therapy was necessary in all cases.
   CONCLUSIONS: Cavernous sinus invasion and subtotal resection are high risk factors for multiple apoplexies in pituitary adenomas. Early treatment is recommended for residual tumor in the cavernous sinus to minimize the risk of recurrent apoplexy with subsequent worse clinical outcome.

AB OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between asymptomatic unruptured intracranial aneurysms (IAs) and pituitary adenomas (PAs) in Chinese people.
   METHODS: In total, 434 patients with newly diagnosed PA and 252 control subjects from the general population who underwent brain computed tomography angiography examination were included. The incidence of IAs and the location of IAs in patients with PA were compared with those in control subjects. The patients with PA with IA were compared with the patients without IA to identify the risk factors for an increased incidence of IA.
   RESULTS: The coexistence of PA and IA was found in 36 patients (8.3%), whereas IAs were found in only 2.4% of the general control subjects, resulting in a significant difference. After stratifying by age, the prevalence of IAs among the patients with PA was still higher than that among the general control subjects in the 5th decade (P = 0.023) and 6th decade (P = 0.035). Most IAs (66.7%) were located in the internal carotid artery, and the location of the IAs did not differ between the patients with PA and the general population. The stepwise multivariate logistic regression indicated that age (P = 0.004) and cavernous sinus invasion (P = 0.022) were related to an increased prevalence of IAs in patients with PA. However, hormone type and sex were not significantly associated with IA prevalence.
   CONCLUSIONS: The patients with PA have an increased incidence of IA compared with age-matched control subjects. Older age and cavernous sinus invasion might be correlated with the increased prevalence of IAs in Chinese patients with PA.

AB OBJECTIVE: We investigated the outcomes of patients with an unruptured intracranial aneurysm (UIA) and >2 risk factors concerning complications, obliteration rate, and other factors after surgical or endovascular treatment.
   METHODS: Coiling and clipping were compared in patients with UIAs treated in West China Hospital from January 2015 to May 2017. Patient survival, dependency, retreatment, complications, and other clinical outcome indexes were compared between the 2 groups.
   RESULTS: A total of 82 patients (92 aneurysms) had undergone treatment for UIAs with multiple risk factors. Of these 82 patients, 45 (54.9%) had undergone clipping and 37 (45.1%) had undergone coiling. No deaths were related to either treatment. Morbidity (modified Rankin scale score >2) at 1 year had developed in 1 of 45 and 1 of 37 patients in the clipping and coiling groups, without a statistically significant difference. Hospitalization >5 days (30 of 45 vs. 12 of 37; P < 0.05) was less frequent after coiling. The number of aneurysms with complete occlusion (48 of 51 vs. 33 of 41; P < 0.05) was greater in the surgical group. No differences in peritreatment complications were found in the surgical and endovascular groups (8 of 45 vs. 6 of 37; P > 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: In our study, clipping and coiling showed advantages for the treatment of UIAs with multiple risk factors. Surgical clipping of UIAs is achievable with a low rate of unfavorable outcomes and a high rate of complete obliteration for patients with multiple risk factors. However, endovascular treatment was also successful, with a shorter length of stay and low procedure-related morbidity. Additional randomized evidence are required to support the superior efficacy of clipping.

AB BACKGROUND: Carotid endarterectomy, especially eversion carotid endarterectomy (ECEA), is a standard treatment of carotid artery stenosis but continues to have deficiencies. We have described a modified ECEA technique that focuses on the quality of life (QoL), called Q-modified eversion carotid endarterectomy (QCEA). The modifications mainly include the skin incision, surgical approach, and arterial anastomosis. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy of QCEA and the QoL of patients after QCEA.
   METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of 109 patients were had undergone ECEA or QCEA from October 2016 to December 2017. The data from all interventions were prospectively collected in a dedicated database. The primary efficacy outcome was the composite of any stroke, myocardial infarction, or death through the 1-year follow-up period. The secondary endpoint was the QoL of patients after ECEA or QCEA on the seventh postoperative day, including incision hematoma, incision numbness, facial swelling, and scar length.
   RESULTS: QCEA was performed in 41 patients and ECEA in 45 patients. No statistically significant differences were found in operating or clamping time between the 2 groups. The incidence of facial swelling (4.9% vs. 28.9%; P = 0.040) and incision numbness (4.9% vs. 24.4%; P = 0.011) in the QCEA group was significantly lower than that in the ECEA group. The average scar length of the QCEA group was significantly shorter than that of the ECEA group (5.1 +/- 1.4 cm vs. 7.6 +/- 2.1 cm; P < 0.001). No transient ischemic attack, stroke, myocardial infarction, or mortality occurred in either group during the 1-year follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that QCEA can reduce incision numbness, facial edema, and scar length, thereby improving the QoL of patients.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with carotid stenosis and identify the predictive factors that affect the mental health status in patients after carotid endarterectomy (CEA).
   METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted of all patients presenting with carotid stenosis treated with CEA. Clinical data and demographics were collected for logistic regression analysis. The Short-Form General Health Survey Questionnaire (SF-36) and minimum clinically important difference were used to evaluate the mental health status of patients after CEA.
   RESULTS: Between January 2015 and September 2017, a total of 224 patients were enrolled in this study. At baseline, mean SF-36 scores for physical component summary (PCS) (60.1 +/- 26.3) and mental component summary (MCS) (59.9 +/- 23.1) were significantly lower in patients with carotid disease than the urban population (P < 0.001). After CEA, the SF-36 scores for PCS (62.5 +/- 21.7) and MCS (68.4 +/- 18.7) were increased. However, only the improvement of MCS achieved minimum clinically important difference. After multiple logistic regression analysis, contralateral stenosis >= 50% (odds ratio [OR] 0.266, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.141-0.517) and hoarseness (OR 0.160, 95% CI 0.040-0.644) had negative effects on MCS. Dizziness improvement had positive effects on MCS (OR 2.882, 95% CI 1.569-0.298).
   CONCLUSIONS: Contralateral stenosis, dizziness improvement, and hoarseness may be the predictive factors that affect the mental health status in patients after CEA.

SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY

DT Article
DE Intraneural ganglion cyst; Obturator cyst; Obturator nerve; Unified
   articular theory
ID NEUROPATHY
AB BACKGROUND: Intraneural ganglion cysts of the obturator nerve are rare. Our aim is to review cases of obturator intraneural ganglion cysts at our institution and those reported in the literature.
   METHODS: We reviewed all cases evaluated by the senior author. A literature search was performed using the PubMed database and Google Scholar with the following terms: "obturator cyst," "obturator intraneural ganglion cyst," and "obturator intraneural ganglia." All cases underwent a retrospective review. Patient demographic data, including age, sex, and presenting signs and symptoms were recorded. Imaging studies were re-evaluated by 2 musculoskeletal radiologists experienced in the diagnosis of intraneural ganglion cysts.
   RESULTS: We identified 2 cases of obturator intraneural ganglia at our institution; both were connected to the hip joint. We found 4 cases that were clearly diagnosed as intraneural ganglia in the literature, of which only 1 was recognized by the original authors as being joint connected, but based on our reinterpretation, 3 of 4 were joint connected. An additional 9 cases identified in the literature did not definitely report the nerve-cyst relationship, but based on our reinterpretation, were believed to be intraneural; 8 were joint connected.
   CONCLUSIONS: We believe that obturator intraneural ganglion cysts adhere to the principles of the unifying articular theory. They arise from the anteromedial hip joint and extend into an articular branch and can reach the parent obturator nerve. Surgery should address the hip disease and/or the articular branch connection. Not appreciating the pathoanatomy of these cysts can lead to persistent or recurrent cysts.

AB OBJECTIVE: Management of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) in neurosurgery residency training may have a significant impact on resident experience, even though few trainees are likely to pursue careers in the field of AIS. The impact of this exposure on resident knowledge in adult spinal disease management is the subject of our retrospective analysis.
   METHODS: An analysis was performed of all adolescent patients undergoing surgical correction of spinal deformity between 2006 and 2016. Patient characteristics, including age at operation, Cobb angles, length of stay, operative time, blood loss, and complications, were collected. Objective benchmarks were created for resident education in the management of AIS. A survey was sent to the last 7 years of graduates to assess the impact of exposure to AIS during neurosurgery training on their current practice.
   RESULTS: Nine male and 37 female patients ages 11 to 22 years were identified. Neurosurgical residents assisted in all procedures without fellows or surgical assistants. Average operative time was 336 minutes (range, 215-575 minutes), and blood loss per procedure was 603 mL (range, 200-4000 mL). The average Cobb angle correction was 72.2% (range, 35.3%-90.9%). Zero of the past 7 graduates currently treat AIS surgically. All 7 graduates agreed that exposure to AIS during residency enhanced their knowledge of adult spinal disease management.
   CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of AIS by surgeons with specialized training can be effective and safe. Resident exposure to these patients enhances their understanding of spinal biomechanics and deformity correction, which is applicable to treating AIS and adult spinal deformity.

AB OBJECTIVE: To compare the safety and efficacy between Woven EndoBridge (WEB) embolization and conventional coiling for treatment of unruptured intracranial aneurysms using a propensity score-matched analysis.
   METHODS: Consecutive patients treated with the WEB at 3 German neurovascular centers and with coiling at a single center during 2011 and 2018 were analyzed. Procedure-related complications, clinical outcome, and angiographic results were retrospectively evaluated and compared.
   RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients treated by coiling and 56 patients treated with the WEB were identified. Significant differences between the 2 groups were observed in patient age (P = 0.048), aneurysm location (P < 0.01), aneurysm size (P = 0.02), and neck width (P < 0.01). The overall complication rate was comparable between the coil group (9.0%) and the WEB group (8.9%, P = 1.0). Favorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale <= 2) was obtained in 98.5% after coiling and 98.2% after WEB treatment. At last available angiographic follow-up, WEB yielded a higher complete aneurysm occlusion rate (87.2%) than coiling (60.8%, P < 0.01). Nine patients in the coil cohort (17.6%) and 2 patients in the WEB cohort (4.3%) underwent retreatment (P = 0.05). After 1:1 propensity score matching, there were no significant differences in complication (P = 1.0) and morbidity rates (P = 1.0), whereas there was a trend toward a higher complete aneurysm occlusion rate after WEB treatment (P = 0.08).
   CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of unruptured aneurysms with the WEB provides potentially higher aneurysm occlusion rates than conventional coiling while having similar complication rates and no additional morbidity.

AB BACKGROUND: The parieto-occipital artery (PoA) is the terminal posterior cerebral artery branch, which typically runs in the parieto-occipital sulcus. Previous studies have highlighted variation in the PoA origin and branching pattern and their clinical implications. Nevertheless, PoA anastomoses have not been systematically investigated. The present study aimed to assess whether putative variation in PoA origin and its branching as well as anastomotic pattern is associated with differences in demographic/anthropometric variables.
   METHODS: In 15 cadaveric heads, PoA anatomic features were quantified and assessed in relation to demographic/anthropometric variables.
   RESULTS: The mean distance of PoA origin from the posterior limit of the splenium and the occipital pole (OP) is 3.1 and 53.1 mm, respectively. The latter is significantly longer in taller individuals. The PoA supplies a mean of 10.5 and 9.1 branches to the precuneus and cuneus, respectively. PoA anastomoses primarily involve the precuneal artery complex (PAc) and the calcarine artery. The analysis indicated significant, positive correlations between the distance of PoA origin from the OP and the number of PoA anastomoses and between the number of PoA precuneal and cuneal branches.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although the PoA invariably supplies the precuneus and almost always the cuneus, its direct contribution to the former seems inferior to PAc. Nevertheless, the PoA frequently shows putative collateral supply networks to the precuneus and cuneus via anastomoses with the PAc and calcarine artery, respectively. The distance between PoA origin and OP varies with an individual's height; the frequency of intrahemispheric PoA anastomoses varies with its site of origin.

AB OBJECTIVE: Confirming the exact location of a fistula and the origins of draining veins during surgery for dural and perimedullary arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) is crucial but sometimes inadequately performed, which can result in incomplete elimination of the lesion. Intraoperative digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is the gold standard for confirming the hemodynamics of an AVF; however, it cannot reveal the location of an AVF in the operative field. In this study, the efficacy of intraoperative intraarterial fluorescence video angiography during surgery for craniocervical junction dural and perimedullary AVFs was investigated.
   METHODS: We repeatedly employed this technology to evaluate its usefulness in revealing the flow dynamics and anatomy of AVFs and to confirm complete elimination of the fistula.
   RESULTS: Seven AVFs were included in this study. Their locations were C1 in 5 cases and C2 in 2 cases. Intraarterial fluorescence video angiography precisely revealed the locations of 3 dural AVFs, 1 perimedullary AVF, and 3 co-occurring dural and perimedullary AVFs. Frame-by-frame review of the fluorescence video angiography clearly demonstrated that fluorescence appeared earlier in the perimedullary AVF than in the draining vein through the dural AVF after intraarterial injection in all 3 co-occurring cases. Complete elimination of the AVF was also confirmed in all cases by fluorescence video angiography, as well as intraoperative and follow-up DSA.
   CONCLUSIONS: Intraarterial fluorescence video angiography, particularly frame-by-frame review, enables surgeons to distinguish the flow dynamics of AVFs and contributes to the planning of effective surgical strategies for optimal results.

AB OBJECTIVE: Tandem cervical carotid and intracranial occlusions are a well-known cause of complicated endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) in acute ischemic stroke. We aimed to evaluate safety and efficacy of an anterograde approach, which involved carotid balloon angioplasty (BA) alone without carotid artery stenting (CAS) followed by intracranial target recanalization (TR).
   METHODS: Between April 2009 and March 2017, 62 patients with tandem lesions confirmed in the cervical carotid and simultaneously in the intracranial arteries had EVT performed to target these lesions. Clinical, imaging, and angiographic outcomes for these patients were analyzed and compared.
   RESULTS: Overall, successful reperfusion was achieved in 80.6% (50/62) and a favorable outcome in 61.3% (38/62) of patients. BA alone was enough to maintain access for TR in 85.5% (group A and B; 53/62), although more than one half (31/53; group B) required rescue CAS at the end of EVT due to elastic recoil. In contrast, emergent CAS was additionally required for the remaining 9 patients to maintain distal access (group C). In a subgroup comparison, procedure time (PT) to target recanalization was significantly shorter in group A and B than group C (P = 0.002). A multivariate regression model revealed age, parenchymal hematoma, and PT to target recanalization as independent predictors of favorable outcome.
   CONCLUSIONS: EVT for tandem cervical carotid and intracranial occlusions showed optimistic results in terms of clinical and angiographic outcome. The anterograde EVT strategy of cervical BA alone then intracranial TR was effective in 85.5% of patients, which was likely to reduce PT to target recanalization.

AB OBJECTIVE: Subthalamic nucleus (STN) is the most targeted localization in the treatment of Parkinson disease (PD) with deep brain stimulation. However, no studies have been found in the literature about possible shape changes of STN in the literature. We aimed to investigate possible shape changes in the STN and the relationship between shape changes and disease duration in PD patients by using statistical analysis.
   METHODS: Patients who were diagnosed with idiopathic PD and controls were enrolled in this study. Age, sex, and disease duration of all cases were recorded. Turbo-spin-echo T2-weighted axial series parallel to the skull base in each case containing midbrain images were obtained, including the whole STN. Standard anatomic landmarks were selected and marked on each digital image using a special software in all cases. Statistical geometric shape and deformation analysis of STN was performed in 2 groups.
   RESULTS: Forty-three patients with PD and 50 age/sex-matched controls were enrolled in this study. There were statistically significant left and right STN shape differences between the groups. Maximum deformation was seen in the dorsolateral parts of both STNs. General shape variability of the STNs was found on the left (0.096) and right (0.049).
   CONCLUSIONS: Significant shape differences and remarkable deformation of STN are seen in patients with PD compared with controls. Maximum deformation was observed in the dorsolateral part of the STN, and with the increase in the duration of the PD, shape differences and deformations became more prominent.

ID GLOSSOPHARYNGEAL NERVE; CAROTID-BODY; HYDROCEPHALUS; DISRUPTION;
   MECHANISM
AB PURPOSE: Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) may lead to vasospasm in various vessels. The cervical nerves have a vasodilatory effect on the upper extremity arteries. The aim of this study was to investigate if there is a relationship between C6 dorsal root ganglion (DRG) degeneration and brachial artery (BA) vasospasm after spinal SAH.
   METHODS: This experimental study was conducted on 23 rabbits. The animals were divided into 3 groups: control (n = 5), SHAM (n = 5), and study group (n = 13). One cubic centimeter (cc) of serum saline was injected into the cisterna magna of animals of the SHAM group; the same procedure was performed by 1 cc of homologous blood in the study group. Degenerated neuron densities (DNDs) of DRGs (n/mm(3)) at C6 levels and BA vasospasm indexes (VSI; wall surface/lumen surface) of all animals were determined and results were analyzed statistically.
   RESULTS: Mean VSI values of BAs and DNDs of C(6)DRGs of the control, SHAM, and study groups were estimated as 10 +/- 3/1.12 +/- 0.11 n/mm(3), 34 +/- 9/1.27 +/- 0.24 n/mm(3), and 1031 +/- 145/2.93 +/- 0.78 n/mm(3), respectively. Mean DNDs and VSI values were statistically significantly different between the control and study groups (P < 0.0001).
   CONCLUSIONS: C(6)DRG degeneration may be considered as an important factor in the etiopathogenesis of severe BA vasospasm after SAH.

TI Symptomatic Idiopathic Spinal Epidural Lipomatosis in 9 Patients:
   Clinical, Radiologic, and Pathogenetic Features
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Cauda equina; Epidural lipomatosis; Venous insufficiency
ID CAUDA-EQUINA SYNDROME; INTRAABDOMINAL PRESSURE; COMPRESSION
AB BACKGROUND: Symptomatic spinal epidural lipomatosis (SSEL) is characterized by hypertrophy of adipose tissue within the spinal canal and consequent neural compromise. The exact pathogenesis remains enigmatic. The authors describe a retrospective case series, define the full clinical spectrum, and discuss possible pathogenetic mechanisms.
   METHODS: The medical notes and imaging of 9 patients with SSEL undergoing surgery from 2008-2018 were analyzed. Seven patients presented secondary to lumbosacral spinal epidural lipomatosis (SEL); 3 patients with chronic incomplete cauda equina syndrome (CES), 3 patients with acute CES (including a 25-week gravid patient and a 40-year-old patient with intravenous leiomyomatosis, both of whom had mild SEL) and 1 patient with chronic lumbar radiculopathy. In addition, 2 patients presented with progressive myelopathy secondary to thoracic SEL.
   RESULTS: Patients presenting with acute CES had a mean age of 37 years (range 23-49 years) and mean extradural fat (EF)-to-spinal canal (SC) ratio of 47% (range 41%-58%), in comparison with patients with chronic CES; mean age 61 years (range 58-65 years) and EF: SC ratio 72% (range 65%-80%). Patients underwent laminectomy and resection of EF at compressive levels. All patients with CES experienced complete resolution of symptoms at follow-up (range 1-48 months).
   CONCLUSIONS: The clinician should be astute to the radiologic features of SEL, particularly in patients presenting with CES in the absence of acute disk herniation. The outcome of patients with CES and SEL after surgery is excellent regardless of symptom duration. Venous impedance related to increased body mass index and EF deposition may play the predominant role in addition to mechanical compression in the pathogenesis of SSEL.

TI Outpatient and Inpatient Readmission Rates of 1-and 2-Level Anterior
   Cervical Discectomy and Fusion Surgeries
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY

DT Article
DE ACDF; Inpatient; Outpatient; Readmission
ID SAFETY
AB OBJECTIVE: This study looks at the various comorbidities and postoperative complications and their impact on readmission rates of patients undergoing outpatient versus inpatient 1- and 2-level anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF). With increasing costs within the United States medical system, one emerging cost-saving strategy is to evolve traditional inpatient procedures into outpatient same-day surgeries. However, patient safety remains a crucial priority.
   METHODS: A total of 28,427 patients were analyzed, with 26,368 undergoing inpatient ACDF surgery and 2059 undergoing outpatient ACDF surgery. Age, sex, comorbidities, postoperative complications, readmission rates, and overall financial cost were compared between both cohorts.
   RESULTS: Data from 28,427 one-and two-level ACDF procedures that were split between inpatient and outpatient were collected. Thirty-day readmission rates were significantly lower in outpatients than inpatients (4% vs. 10.1%, P < 0.001). Inpatients had higher rates of urinary tract infection (2.4% vs. 1.4%), deep vein thrombosis (0.6% vs. 0%), and myocardial infarction (0.2% vs. 0%), whereas outpatients had higher rates of pulmonary embolism (7.7% vs. 0.4%). Outpatients had increased readmission risk with comorbidities of diabetes (odds ratio [OR], 48.93; P < 0.001), smoking (OR, 4.6; P < 0.001), body mass index >= 30 (OR, 2392; P < 0.001). The average cost of outpatient surgery was less than that of inpatient surgery ($7774.8 vs. $7956.75, P = 0.0444).
   CONCLUSION: This study suggests that in the appropriately selected patients, ACDF can safely be performed in an outpatient setting.

   INITIATION
AB BACKGROUND: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) has been explored as a target to treat axial motor symptoms of advanced Parkinson disease (PD). The aim of this study was to consider relative effects of bilateral subthalamic nucleus (STN) and PPN DBS on both initiation and inhibition of saccades in advanced PD.
   METHODS: Five patients with advanced PD performed 2 different oculomotor tasks off stimulation, with bilateral STN DBS, with bilateral PPN DBS, and with simultaneous bilateral STN and PPN DBS. The first task involved visually guided saccades, and the second task involved antisaccades (ASs). Saccadic latency, accuracy, and velocity were recorded for both the visually guided saccade and AS tasks, and prosaccades were measured for the AS task alone. Control subjects included patients with advanced PD without DBS, age-matched healthy subjects, and young healthy subjects (n = 12 in each group).
   RESULTS: Simultaneous bilateral STN and PPN DBS produced the greatest improvement in mean latencies, velocities, and accuracies for visually guided saccades and ASs compared with DBS off (P < 0.001). Bilateral STN and PPN DBS caused a significant additional improvement compared with STN DBS alone by reducing the number of prosaccades (P < 0.01).
   CONCLUSIONS: It is known that the frontal lobe is involved in saccadic inhibition during AS tasks. Hence, our novel finding of an improvement in the AS task suggests an ascending, frontally mediated effect of PPN DBS. This implies that there may be PPN-to-frontal lobe connections that may partly explain the benefits of PPN DBS in axial motor function.

AB BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major health issue in developing nations such as India along with underreporting of TBI data because of a lack of major studies targeting the population with TBI. Various lacunae from field to tertiary centers are responsible for this significant burden of TBIs. We studied the epidemiologic profile of 1150 patients with TBI including the predictors of the outcome of TBIs in a tertiary health care institution in North India to identify the modifiable factors that could be used to improve the outcome and reduce the TBI burden.
   METHODS: Patients presenting with TBI to a level I trauma center were identified and enrolled in the study. Data regarding patient information from accident to discharge or death were collected as per designed format and analyzed to determine outcome predictors.
   RESULTS: Mean age was 36 +/- 15.8 years and 84.6% of patients were male; road traffic accident was the mode of injury in 64.26% of cases. Lack of adequate prehospital care was seen in our study. Glasgow Coma Scale score on admission, Injury Severity Score, and Rotterdam CT score were found to be the 3 statistically significant predictors of outcome in patients with TBI.
   CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge about the causes, pattern, and distribution of patients with TBI from this study is helpful in policy making, research, health management, and rehabilitation at the national level in ours and in other nations.

AB OBJECTIVE: Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) has been a widely accepted procedure for the treatment of cervical disc diseases. However, due to several reports regarding postfusion exacerbation of adjacent segments, a motion-preserving prosthesis was developed. In the present retrospective analysis, total disc replacement (TDR) using ActivC (Aesculap AG, Tuttlingen, Germany) was compared with ACDF using a stand-alone cage.
   METHODS: Among patients diagnosed with cervical disc diseases, those who received either ACDF or TDR at a single level between C3 and C7 from January 2010 to December 2015 were reviewed. Clinical outcomes were assessed using the visual analogue scale for arm and neck pain and the neck disability index. Clinical scales, lateral neutral, and flexion-extension radiographs were taken for all patients preoperatively and 2 months, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years postoperatively. Global lordosis, C2-C7 Sagittal vertical axis, and T1 slope were measured on lateral neutral radiographs. The segmental range of motion (ROM) of the operated level, cranial adjacent level, and caudal adjacent level were defined as the difference between Cobb angles on flexion-extension lateral radiographs.
   RESULTS: A total of 53 patients (mean age 48.5 years) were reviewed. Thirty patients were treated with ACDF and the remaining 23 patients received TDR. At the 2-year follow-up, the segmental ROM of operated level was significantly preserved in the TDR group compared with the ACDF group (P = 0.007). Conversely, no significant differences in the ROM at the adjacent segments were observed between the TDR and ACDF groups (P > 0.05). The clinical outcome was excellent in both ACDF and TDR groups and was maintained until the 2-year follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, TDR using ActivC showed successful motion preservation at the operated level and equivalent results were observed with ACDF based on clinical and radiologic results.

AB OBJECTIVE: At our institution, skull base reconstruction using a free mucosal graft from the nasal cavity floor has been the standardized technique after pituitary adenoma resection via transsellar approach. In this study, the expected appearance of the reconstruction on postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans is described and its integrity and impact on the sinonasal cavity are assessed.
   METHODS: Fifty patients were selected, and their electronic medical records were reviewed for postoperative course, Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-22 (SNOT-22) scores, and nasal endoscopy reports. A total of 116 postoperative MRI scans were available to evaluate 1) the appearance and thickness of the graft, 2) the enhancement of the graft, and 3) the T2 signal in sphenoid sinus as a potential indication for inflammatory disease.
   RESULTS: There was no significant change in the thickness of the graft over time. Except for the 7 scans that were obtained without intravenous contrast, all scans showed enhancement of the graft. About half of the patients showed persistent T2 hyperintense signal at 12 and 24 months. However, this finding was not clinically significant, because postoperative SNOT-22 scores showed minimal sinonasal impact.
   CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative MRI surveillance scans showed a stable appearance of the graft that mimics the native mucosa, with enhancement through time, reflecting its robust vascularization and integration to the skull base. Although persistent T2 hyperintense signal was detected in the sphenoid sinus, clinical evidence based on nasal endoscopy reports and SNOT-22 scores indicated minimal sinonasal morbidity.

DE Cornerstone technique; Hemifacial spasm; Microvascular decompression;
   Vertebral artery
ID SLING TECHNIQUE; TRANSPOSITION
AB BACKGROUND: Microvascular decompression surgery is the most effective treatment for hemifacial spasm (HFS). The vertebral artery (VA) is a larger and more elastic vessel, which makes surgical management more difficult. We introduce a surgical technique of proximal Teflon transposition with interposition (PTTI) in the vertebromedullary space for HFS with a VA offender.
   METHODS: In 112 patients with HFS, 22 patients had a VA offender on the facial nerve exit zone. Six of 22 patients with a VA offender underwent surgery by traditional microvascular decompression at the facial nerve exit zone, and 16 patients underwent the PTTI technique. We compared surgical outcomes of the PTTI technique and the conventional technique for HFS associated with the VA. We also compared surgical outcomes of the PTTI technique with outcomes of other alternative techniques.
   RESULTS: The PTTI technique was associated with a good operative prognosis and fewer complications. The PTTI technique is an easy, safe, and effective method for treatment of patients with HFS with a VA offender.
   CONCLUSIONS: The PTTI technique can be considered as another treatment option in addition to the transposition technique reported previously.

AB OBJECTIVE: There is no consensus on a standardized approach to spasticity or dystonia management of cerebral palsy (CP). This study aimed to investigate clinical outcomes and compare therapeutic responses for pallidal stimulation versus intrathecal baclofen (ITB) therapy in adult patients with severe CP.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed patients with CP treated with deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the globus pallidus internus (GPi) or implantation of ITB pump between June 2003 and April 2017. Patients were included if they were clinically diagnosed with medically intractable CP and had >12 months of postprocedural follow-up data. Patients were assessed before and 12 months post-treatment using the visual analogue scale, Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale, self-rating improvement scale, and 36-Item Short-Form General Health Survey Questionnaire.
   RESULTS: Patients (n = 22) were divided into GPi DBS (n = 12) and ITB therapy (n = 10) groups. For the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale, DBS group movement scores and ITB group disability scores were significantly improved post-treatment. Although visual analogue scales did not differ between groups, self-rating improvement scores differed significantly between groups. For quality of life, physical functioning, body pain, vitality, social functioning, and mental health significantly improved in ITB group 12 months post-treatment compared with those of preoperative period. Only mental health differed significantly between groups.
   CONCLUSIONS: Despite retrospective design and relatively low number of cases, this study indicated that ITB therapy was less invasive and more effective in improving the quality of life compared with GPi DBS. ITB therapy should be considered an alternative treatment for patients with severe CP.

AB BACKGROUND: Symptomatic postoperative spinal epidural hematoma is a serious complication that may occur after lumbar spine surgery. We analyzed epidural hematoma using postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after biportal endoscopic spinal surgery and its impact on clinical outcome.
   METHODS: The subjects of this study were 158 patients who underwent single-level decompression using the biportal endoscopic spinal surgery technique from 2015 to 2017. MRI was performed in all patients before and after surgery, and postoperative MRI was used to identify epidural hematoma. The preoperative and postoperative visual analog scale (VAS) score for leg and back pain, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and modified Macnab criteria were recorded for evaluation of clinical outcome. The group with postoperative spinal epidural hematoma (group A) and without hematoma (group B) were comparatively analyzed, both radiologically and clinically.
   RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 67.9 +/- 11.1 years (range, 49-89). The total number with grade 0 (no hematoma) was 119 levels patients (75.3%) on the T2 axial image of postoperative MRI. The total number of patients with hematoma was 39 (24.7%) according to T2-weighted axial postoperative MRI. Two patients underwent revision surgery because of hematoma-related symptoms. The improvement of clinical outcome measures including VAS leg, VAS back, and ODI was significantly different between group A and B (P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of postoperative spinal epidural hematoma after biportal endoscopic spinal surgery according to postoperative MRI was higher than expected, regardless of the patients' postoperative symptoms. Postoperative hematoma has a decisive influence on postoperative results, and revision surgery might be necessary if canal encroachment is >50% with concomitant symptoms.

   OUTCOMES
AB OBJECTIVE: The present study investigated the clinical and morphological characteristics of the vertebrobasilar artery associated with vascular healing in patients with unruptured spontaneous intracranial vertebral artery (VA) dissection (VAD).
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the data from 69 consecutive patients with a diagnosis of unruptured VAD who were treated conservatively for >= 21 days from November 2003 to February 2018 at our institute. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate the clinical characteristics and morphological findings of VAD.
   RESULTS: Of the 69 patients, vascular normalization of VAD was observed in 26, including a significantly greater proportion of women and nonsmokers (P = 0.04 and P = 0.034, respectively). Patients with normalization of VAD had a significantly lower proportion of posteroinferior cerebellar artery involvement and a smaller vertebralunion- basilar angle of the nondissecting VA, smaller vertebral-union-vertebral angle, distal dissection from the VA union, and less basilar artery bending. Luminal irregularity/steno-occlusion of the VAD on the initial images exhibited vascular resolution/normalization in 25 patients (67.6%) on subsequent images. The morphology of VAD in the dominant or codominant VAs included fusiform/ aneurysmal dilatation in 25 patients (78.1%). The morphology in the nondominant VA included luminal irregularity/steno-occlusion in 23 patients (62.2%).
   CONCLUSIONS: Spontaneous vascular normalization of unruptured spontaneous intracranial VAD might be associated with female sex, nonsmoking, no posteroinferior cerebellar artery involvement, a smaller vertebral-union-basilar angle and vertebral-union-vertebral angle, distal dissection from the VA union, less basilar artery bending, and luminal irregularity/steno-occlusion.

AB OBJECTIVE: Cardiac dysfunction may worsen outcomes after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). This study quantitatively assessed the prognostic value of left ventricular dysfunction with respect to functional outcomes and mortality in patients with aneurysmal SAH.
   METHODS: We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE databases to retrieve relevant studies evaluating echocardiographic left ventricular dysfunction following aneurysmal SAH. Fourteen relevant observational studies evaluating 2234 patients were finally included in this study.
   RESULTS: Echocardiographic regional wall motion abnormalities (RWMA) and neurogenic cardiomyopathy (NCM) of the left ventricle occurring after SAH were significantly related to an increase of in-hospital mortality (in 8 studies for RWMA, odds ratio [OR] 2.37; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.74-3.25 and in 5 studies for NCM, OR 2.82; 95% CI 1.2-6.6). Decreased ejection fraction on echocardiography was not associated with the increase of in-hospital mortality (in 4 studies, OR 1.76; 95% CI 0.86-3.61). The heterogeneities of decreased ejection fraction and NCM were significantly resolved by analyzing only the studies based on echocardiogram measurements obtained within 72 hours after admission.
   CONCLUSIONS: The present meta-analysis suggests that the identification of echocardiographic left ventricular dysfunction identified by RWMA and NCM after SAH could provide better prognostic information for in-hospital mortality.

ID SURGICAL ANATOMY; EXPOSURE
AB BACKGROUND: Anterior clinoidectomy is considered difficult because important structures are adjacent to but hidden behind the anterior clinoid process (ACP). We sought to make anterior clinoidectomy a simpler procedure.
   METHODS: A modification of anterior clinoidectomy is presented. To obtain a radiologic basis, original images from 357 consecutive sets of computed tomography angiography data were assessed.
   RESULTS: Anterior clinoidectomy was performed in 77 consecutive patients, as follows. By making a small window in the lateral wall of the ACP and curetting out the content inside, the lateral wall of the optic canal was easily exposed and functioned as a landmark for removal of the remaining bone. In addition, by removing the posterior edge and thinning the lateral part, the ACP was fractured and removed. The optic canal was opened if needed. No complications due to anterior clinoidectomy were observed.
   Among the 689 sides evaluated, 641 sides showed cancellous bone and 29 showed well-developed pneumatization inside the ACP. In each ACP examined, we observed the presence of compact bone facing the optic nerve, which constitutes the lateral wall of the optic canal. On 180 sides, part of the compact bone between the clinoid process and the internal carotid artery was absent; in other cases, thin compact bone was present.
   CONCLUSIONS: Visualizing the optic canal in the early stage of the procedure allows anterior clinoidectomy to be performed safely.

AB BACKGROUND: A discrepancy between definitions of morphologic parameters describing cerebral aneurysms across studies leads to conflicting results concerning performances of these factors and threshold values for rupture status prediction. The aim of the study was to evaluate how various definitions of morphologic parameters may influence the prediction of the risk for aneurysm rupture.
   METHODS: A total of 425 intracranial aneurysms were reviewed. Analyzed factors included demographic and clinical parameters, aneurysm maximal height (Hmax), dome length (Dlength), dome width (Dwidth), dome maximal diameter (Dmax) and dome minimal diameter (Dmin), neck length (Nlength), neck width (Nwidth), and neck maximal diameter (Nmax) and neck minimal diameter (Nmin). Alternative definitions of aspect ratio (AR), bottleneck factor (BNF), and height-to-width ratio (HW) were used. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed to identify predictors for aneurysm rupture.
   RESULTS: Hmax, AR defined as Hmax/Nwidth and Hmax/Nmin, BNF definitions using Nwidth and Nmin, and selected definitions of HW (Hmax/Dlength and Hmax/Dmin) were indicated as potential predictors for rupture. Aneurysm location was found to be a confounding factor with statistical significance. AR defined as Hmax/Nwidth and Hmax/Nmin were the best performers (P < 0.001; area under the curve, 0.64). In multivariate analysis, AR defined as Hmax/Nwidth and aneurysm location with significantly higher risk for rupture of anterior communicating artery aneurysms were independent predictors for subarachnoid hemorrhage.
   CONCLUSIONS: Different definitions of aneurysm parameters affect various rupture risk determination. AR defined as Hmax/Nwidth and aneurysm location with significantly higher rupture risk of anterior communicating artery aneurysms are independent predictors for aneurysm rupture.

AB BACKGROUND: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) are increasingly used together to manage brain metastases (BMs). We assessed adverse radiation effect, disease control, and overall survival in patients with BMs who received SRS with anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyteeassociated protein 4 and/or anti-programmed cell death protein receptor/ligand therapies.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of patients with intact or resected BMs treated with SRS and ICIs within 5 months of SRS between 2010 and 2018. Patients were defined as receiving concurrent SRS and ICI if a dose of ICI was given within 4 weeks of SRS. Local failure, distant intracranial failure, extracranial failure, and adverse radiation effect were assessed using cumulative incidence rates and competing risk regressions with death as a competing risk. Overall survival was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards models.
   RESULTS: A total of 97 patients with 580 BMs were included in our analysis. Competing risk analyses showed that concurrent SRS-ICI therapy is associated with higher rates of adverse radiation effect (6.4% vs. 2.0% at 1 year; multivariable hazard ratio [HR], 4.47; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.57-12.73; P = 0.005), lower rates of extracranial failure (69.7% vs. 80.8% at 1 year; multivariable HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.42-0.87; P = 0.007), and better overall survival (48.6% vs. 25.4% at 1 year; multivariable HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.33-0.99; P = 0.044) compared with nonconcurrent therapy. SRS-ICI timing was not associated with local failure or distant intracranial failure.
   CONCLUSIONS: Concurrent SRS-ICI therapy has a tolerable adverse event profile and may improve extracranial disease control and overall survival, supporting concurrent use in the management of BMs.

AB OBJECTIVE: A profound understanding of the relationship between the deep cervical fasciae and the skull base is essential for skull base surgery. To our knowledge, there has been little research on the relationship between the deep cervical fasciae and inferior surface of the skull base; thus, this study aims to examine the fascial network of the skull base.
   METHODS: Two cadaveric heads are dissected to reveal the fascial network of the skull base and 19 sides of cadaveric heads were used to reveal an anatomical variant of the pterygospinous and pterygoalar ligaments/muscles.
   RESULTS: The interpterygoid fascia is attached to the skull base along the sphenopetrosal fissure and tympanosquamous suture. The tensor vascular styloid fascia extends from the inferior border of the tensor veli palatini and covers the tympanic bone and styloid apparatus laterally. The pharyngobasilar fascia attaches to the pharyngeal tubercle on the inferior surface of the basilar part of the occipital bone and petro-occipital synchondrosis. In the middle of the clivus, we found thick fibrocartilaginous tissue and the prevertebral fascia fused to this area. Fascia of the longus capitis, the tensor-vascular styloid fascia, and stylopharyngeal fascia extend laterally and form the complex fascial network around the internal jugular vein and the internal carotid artery. The carotid sheath attaches anteriorly to the vaginal process and posteriorly to the fibrocartilaginous tissue around the jugular foramen and carotid canal.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study comprehensively exposes the fascial network of the skull base. Our cadaveric dissection findings support those from previous imaging-anatomical studies. Precise knowledge of these fascial layers is essential for accurate diagnosis and understanding the spread of disease, as well as helping skull base surgeons safely perform challenging procedures.

AB BACKGROUND: A clival plate and screw fitted to the craniovertebral junction (CVJ) were developed in our previous studies. However, the anatomy of intracranial structures related to clival screw placement has not been studied.
   OBJECTIVE: To measure the intracranial anatomic parameters delineating the basilar plexus and vertebrobasilar artery (VBA) course and to determine the relationship between brainstem and clivus for safer screw placement.
   METHODS: Morphometric analysis of the VBA was conducted on 95 patients (48 men, 47 women) by CT angiography (CTA) and of the basilar plexus and brainstem on 80 patients (44 men, 36 women) by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) The narrowest distance between the VBA and the intracranial clivus and the distance between the VBA and the median line of the skull were measured on the axial plane at different parts. The relative positions of point I (intersection of vertebral artery and basilar artery) and the pharyngeal tubercle were analyzed. The distance between the clivus and the brainstem was measured at different levels.
   RESULTS: As the VBA ascended the distances to the intracranial clivus and the midline decreased. In 83.3% cases, point I was above the pharyngeal tubercle, and in only 9.5% cases was it located on the vertical line drawn from pharyngeal tubercle. The smallest safe space between the intracranial clivus and the brainstem was 7.46 mm at the lower part.
   CONCLUSION: Appropriate screw size at the lower clivus and the pharyngeal tubercle may help avoiding inadvertent injury to the brainstem and the VBA. Preoperative CTA and MRI of the CVJ are suggested to guide the surgeon in this regard.

AB BACKGROUND: Glioblastomas (GBMs) are primary brain tumors that are very difficult to treat. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the reference tool for diagnosis, postoperative control, and follow-up of GBM. The MRI tumor contrast enhancement part serves as a target for surgery. However, there are controversial data about the influence of pre- and postoperative tumor volumetric MRI parameters on overall survival (OS).
   METHODS: Data of 57 patients with GBM were analyzed retrospectively. All patients had maximum safe resection and standard adjuvant treatment. All patients underwent 1.5-T MRI with contrast in the first 24 hours postoperatively. The data of pre- and postoperative volumetric parameters were analyzed using the original software.
   RESULTS: Correlation analysis between the postoperative volume of the tumor contrast enhancement part and the patient's OS revealed a significant level (on the Chaddock scale) of inverse correlation. Residual tumor volume associated with OS of >6 months was determined as <2.5 cm(3). The mortality risk in the first 6 months after tumor resection is 3.4 times higher when the tumor remnant is >2.5 cm(3) (risk ratio, 3.4; P = 0.0002).
   CONCLUSIONS: The volume of MRI contrast-enhancing GBM remnants after surgery, automatically measured by the software, was a significant predictor for early postoperative progression and death.

AB BACKGROUND: The number of elderly patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms is increasing with time in aging populations; however, the choice of the proper treatment method remains inconclusive. The goal of the study is to evaluate the possible complications and treatment outcome among elderly patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysm.
   METHODS: We analyzed 139 patients >65 years old, hospitalized between 2007 and 2017 in the high-volume neurosurgical center and diagnosed with unruptured intracranial aneurysm. From their medical records, we obtained medical history and aneurysm characteristics. Patients functional status was measured by modified Rankin Scale score on admission and at discharge.
   RESULTS: Seventy-two patients (55.97%) underwent aneurysm clipping and 39 (27.04%) coiling. Eighteen patients (11.90%) required stent assisted coiling and 4 (5.00%) had a single stent placement. A total of 133 patients (95.71%) had good treatment outcomes (modified Rankin Scale score 0-3, surgical 0.32 +/- 1.03 vs. endovascular group 0.40 +/- 1.12, P = 0.65). Complete or near-complete occlusion in the endovascular group was achieved in 83% directly after treatment and in 89% at 6-12 months after procedure. The microsurgical group presented 100% occlusion at follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: Despite the high prevalence of comorbidities in the age group >65 years old, the vast majority of patients in our series treated invasively for unruptured intracranial aneurysms presented with good treatment outcomes. Based on our results, among elderly patients, modern microsurgical as well as endovascular management of brain aneurysms in a high-volume center seems to be a safe and effective method of treatment.

AB BACKGROUND: Primary central nervous system lymphomas (PCNSLs) account for 1%-2% of primary central nervous system tumors. Until recently, treatment has centered on biopsy, radiotherapy, and high-dose methotrexate, without a clear role for cytoreductive surgery. The objective of this article is to compare the impact of biopsy versus cytoreductive surgery in outcomes of patients with PCNSL, including postoperative complications and survival.
   METHODS: We performed a systematic review of literature published from January 1, 1968 to May 2, 2018 related to PCNSL treatment in patients undergoing biopsy or resection. Data on morbidity, progression-free survival, and overall survival were extracted and analyzed.
   RESULTS: A total of 1291 nonduplicate citations were identified, with 244 articles selected for full-text review. Twenty-four articles were included for data abstraction including 2 level IIb studies, 4 level IIIb studies, and the remaining 18 articles representing level IVb studies. Of these articles, 15 failed to show benefit with cytoreductive surgery; most of these articles included relatively small sample sizes and predated standardization of high-dose systemic methotrexate treatment. Larger, more recent series included 9 articles providing evidence in support of cytoreductive surgery. Patient age, functional status, and treatment with chemotherapy and/or radiation were associated with improved survival across studies.
   CONCLUSIONS: The treatment of PCNSL is challenging and ever-evolving. Earlier, smaller studies failed to show the benefit of cytoreductive surgery over biopsy in patients with PCNSL. Larger, more recent series seem to show the possible benefit of cytoreductive surgery in PCNSL. Future well-designed prospective studies may help further elucidate the role of resection in the modern treatment of PCNSL.

   Neuropsychology
AB OBJECTIVE: Adults with Chiari malformation type 1 (CM1) often report cognitive impairment. This cross-sectional study investigates the cognitive and emotional functioning of a sample of adults with CM1 who presented for neurosurgical evaluation prior to intervention.
   METHODS: A total of 36 participants (18 patients with CM1 and 18 healthy control subjects) completed a comprehensive neurocognitive battery of tests.
   RESULTS: Demographic variables (sex, age, handedness, and education) were not statistically significant between the groups. Measures of gross cognition (Mini-Mental State Examination and Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status) were statistically significant between the groups. On a more focused assessment of neurocognitive abilities, the CM1 group performed significantly worse on measures of learning, memory, fluency, and figural copy. A high rate of clinical depression was seen in the CM1 group; however, this did not correlate with cognitive performance.
   CONCLUSIONS: The CM1 group displayed subtle learning, semantic fluency, and complex construction difficulties compared with healthy control subjects. Although not correlated with cognition, adults with CM1 are at high risk for clinical depression.

DT Review
DE Medical education research; Neurosurgery; Scoping review
ID TECHNOLOGY-ENHANCED SIMULATION; TRAINING MODELS; CARE
AB BACKGROUND: Little is known about the state of medical education (ME) research in neurosurgery. As ME started to develop in neurosurgery in recent years, it is important to understand the current status and develop the theory for advancement in neurosurgery. The aim of this study was to undertake a scoping review of neurosurgery literature on ME research.
   METHODS: MEDLINE, SCOPUS, and PubMed databases were searched. Inclusion criteria were full-text articles in English published from January 2006 to December 2017. Research aspects included country of publication, annual number of publications, journal types, type of participants, frequently researched topics, and research design. Search terms included neurosurgery, medical education, teaching, training, learning, and curriculum.
   RESULTS: A total of 9863 references were found across 3 databases. After duplicate removal and further screening, 533 references remained for coding analysis. ME research activity in neurosurgery is increasing and commonly observed in Western countries. Identified articles were mostly quantitative, with curriculum, assessment (especially simulation), and teaching and learning being the most dominant research themes.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the need for enhanced quantity and quality of ME research in neurosurgery. It identifies areas of highest priority and aspects to be improved and provides us with a rationale for future development in ME in neurosurgery. These findings reveal future education research direction and programmatic research areas, while also establishing a benchmark to assess changes in educational scholarship over time.

AB BACKGROUND: The pathophysiology of cerebral aneurysm formation remains to be elucidated. Estrogen is thought to be protective against the development of aneurysms. The aim of this study is to identify differentially expressed genes in the estrogen receptor pathway that may be linked to the development of cerebral aneurysms.
   METHODS: Data from 6 Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases with gene expression profiles of cerebral aneurysm tissue were analyzed (GSE6551, GSE15629, GSE26969, GSE46337, GSE54083, and GSE75436). Ninety-four genes associated with the estrogen receptor pathway were identified from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway database. A meta-analysis using a random-effects model was used to evaluate the association of the estrogen receptor pathway genes with aneurysm formation.
   RESULTS: Four genes related to the estrogen receptor pathway were significantly associated with intracranial aneurysms, 2 of which were downregulated (PIK3R1: fold change [FC] = 0.41, false discovery rate [FDR] = 6.1 x 10(-) 5, ADCY9: FC = 0.55, FDR = 2.3 x 10(-4)) and 2 of which were upregulated (HBEGF: FC = 1.46, FDR = 4.9 x 10(-4); ADCY7: FC = 2.11, FDR = 6.0 x 10(-3)). Furthermore, subgroup analysis of 2 GEO databases with information provided about sex demonstrated PIK3R1 to be significant independently in both men (FC = 0.46, FDR = 6.3 x 10(-5)) and women (FC = 0.46, FDR = 2.3 x 10(-4)), whereas JUN, ADCY5, and MMP9 were significant in women only.
   CONCLUSIONS: The analysis of 6 GEO databases revealed 4 differentially expressed genes (PIK3R1, HBEGF, ADCY7, and ADCY9) in cerebral aneurysm tissue that are associated with the estrogen receptor pathway. Further analysis of estrogen-associated differentially expressed genes may provide information about the protective effects of estrogen on cerebral aneurysm development.

TI Epidemiology of Iatrogenic Vertebral Artery Injury in Cervical Spine
   Surgery: 21 Multicenter Studies
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Cervical spine; Complication; Epidemiology; Iatrogenic; Surgery;
   Vertebral artery injury
ID FIXATION; SCREW
AB BACKGROUND: The overall incidence of iatrogenic vertebral artery injury (IVAI) in cervical spine surgeries (CSSs) is reported to be 0.07%-1.4%. Although IVAI occurred during C1-2 fusion, there is no accurate information regarding the surgery-specific risk of IVAI. This study aimed to stratify incidence of IVAI by surgical method and evaluate the correlation between IVAI and its sequelae.
   METHODS: This retrospective, multicenter study involved clinical and radiologic evaluations for IVAI. All CSSs performed between 2012 and 2016 were included; neck mass excision and pain intervention were excluded. Patient characteristics, diagnosis, surgical technique, complications, and presence of IVAI were collected. In IVAI cases, technique details, characteristics, and sequelae were investigated.
   RESULTS: This study included 14,722 patients with 15,582 CSSs in 21 centers. IVAIs were identified in 13 (0.08%) patients. Surgery-specific incidence of IVAI was 1.35% in cases involving C1-2 posterior fixation and 0.20% in cases involving C3-6 posterior fixation. Common injury mechanisms were screw-in (31%) and high-speed drilling (23%). Screw-related IVAI occurred in 9 (69%) patients, and IVAI of the C1 lateral mass and C2 pedicle screws occurred in 4 and 3 patients, respectively. Of 13 cases of IVAI, 3 (23%) involved cerebellar or stem infarction; the infarction had no substantial correlation with injury grade or dominancy.
   CONCLUSIONS: Overall incidence of IVAI in CSSs was 0.08%. C1-2 posterior fixation had the highest incidence of IVAI (1.35%). Although clinical results of IVAI can be highly variable, controlling risk factors of IVAI is important.

AB OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyze serum levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and endostatin in patients with cerebral treated by stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), and to assess their association with radiological radiation-induced changes (RICs).
   METHODS: To measure serum biomarkers, peripheral venous blood was collected before SRS and 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months after SRS. To evaluate RICs, clinical and neuroimaging follow-up were performed concurrently every 6 months after SRS.
   RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients were enrolled (11 in the group with RIC, 16 in the group without RIC). Serum VEGF and endostatin levels were positively correlated (P = 0.036, r = 0.405). In the group with RIC, the median serum VEGF 6 months after SRS (58.98 pg/mL) was significantly higher than that of the group without RIC (15.17 pg/mL) (P = 0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that higher VEGF 6 months after SRS (P = 0.001, hazard ratio, 1.032; 95% confidence interval, 1.012-1.052) and lower endostatin 1 month after SRS (P = 0.007, hazard ratio, 0.964; 95% confidence interval, 0.935-0.993) were significantly associated with RICs.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that serum levels of VEGF 6 months after SRS were higher in the group with RIC. Serum levels of VEGF 6 months and endostatin 1 month after SRS were associated with the radiological RICs. Thus, serial measurements of serum VEGF and endostatin after SRS might help predict RICs in patients with arteriovenous malformation treated by SRS.

AB OBJECTIVE: The study was aimed to compare the validity, reproducibility, precision, and efficiency of a picture archiving and communication system (PACS) and a smart-phone application, which is an educative app to easily measure sagittal balance parameters (SagittalMeter Pro), for measuring spinopelvic sagittal parameters.
   METHODS: Three spine surgeons measured lumbar lordosis (LL), pelvic incidence (PI), sacral slope (SS), and pelvic tilt (PT) on standing posteroanterior radiographs of 30 patients using PACS and SagittalMeter Pro. Measurements were repeated a week after the original measurements. Intraobserver and interobserver variabilities and reliabilities of each parameter (LL, PI, SS, and PT) were calculated for both techniques. Comparisons were performed using the paired t-test. Results are expressed as mean +/- standard deviation and P values of < 0.05 were considered significant.
   RESULTS: PACS to SagittalMeter Pro differences between the mean absolute values of LL, PI, SS, PT were 0.50 degrees, 0.82 degrees, 0.81 degrees, 0.34 degrees, respectively, and intraobserver and interobserver variabilities were similar. Excellent intraobserver and interobserver reliabilities were obtained for PACS and SagittalMeter Pro as demonstrated by values >0.86 and >0.84, respectively. Measurement times for PACS and SagittalMeter Pro were 36.63 +/- 7.55 and 14.57 +/- 1.96 seconds, respectively, and this difference was significant (P = 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: The study shows PACS and SagittalMeter Pro are equivalent in terms of their abilities to measure spinopelvic sagittal parameters, and that the time required to obtain measurements was significantly less for SagittalMeter Pro. We believe that SagittalMeter Pro may be helpful when planning spinal surgery.

AB OBJECTIVE: There is a paucity of studies on readmission rates in elderly patients over a period of 360 days after spinal surgery.
   METHODS: We identified 1248 patients older than 70 years who underwent degenerative lumbar spinal surgery from November 2005 to April 2015. We reviewed the patients who were readmitted within 360 days and compared them by univariate and multivariate analysis with the nonreadmitted patients for each period of 0-30, 30-90, 90-180, and 180-360 days postoperatively to determine risk factors for hospital readmission.
   RESULTS: A total of 1248 patients (733 female, 58.7%) were enrolled in the study. The number of readmitted patients was 37 (2.96%), 94 (7.53%), 145 (11.62%), 182 (14.58%), and 213 (17.07%) at 30, 90, 180, 270, and 360 days, respectively. Surgical site-related problems decreased gradually in the first 0-90 days and slightly increased after then. Non-surgical site-related problems gradually increased with time. Logistic multiple regression analysis showed that electrocardiographic abnormalities, male sex, low hemoglobin levels, asthma, heart disease, intensive care unit admission, low alanine aminotransferase level, high body mass index, and high platelet level were risk factors for readmission.
   CONCLUSIONS: We found that electrocardiographic abnormalities, male sex, low hemoglobin levels, asthma, heart disease, intensive care unit admission, low aspartate aminotransferase level, high body mass index, and high platelet level were risk factors for readmission. As the postoperative observational period became longer, the reasons for readmission tended to be more related to nonsurgical site-related problems than to surgical-related problems.T

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate the acute and long-term effects of vitamin D supplementation on the recovery of patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI).
   METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted involving 345 patients with TBI who visited a single trauma center. Vitamin D serum levels were measured without supplementation at admission, 1 month, and 3 months post-TBI (control group) from August to December 2016. From January 2017, vitamin D supplementation was provided to patients with TBI with low vitamin D serum levels at admission (supplement group). The outcomes were investigated by assessing performance function (Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale) and cognitive function (Mini-Mental Status Examination, and Clinical Dementia Rating) at 1 week and 3 months post-TBI.
   RESULTS: The mean vitamin D serum level in patients with TBI at admission was 13.62 +/- 9.01 ng/mL. The level significantly increased from 14.03 +/- 8.68 ng/mL at admission to 37.42 +/- 12.57 ng/mL at 3 months post TBI in the supplement group (P < 0.001). The cognitive outcomes (Mini-Mental Status Examination/Clinical Dementia Rating, P = 0.042/P = 0.044) and GOS-E score (total TBI, P = 0.003; mild-to-moderate TBI, P = 0.002) significantly improved from the first week to 3 months post TBI in the patients with vitamin D supplementation.
   CONCLUSIONS: Administration of vitamin D supplements in mild-to-moderate TBI patients with significant vitamin D deficiency during the acute phase of the injury may improve long-term performance and cognitive outcomes. Therefore, the treatment strategies should be individually planned for the patients with TBI based on their baseline vitamin D level.

AB BACKGROUND: Stereotactic needle biopsy provides a minimally invasive option for the diagnosis of intracranial lesions but is limited by inconclusive diagnoses on frozen pathology. For rapid pathology, 5-aminovelunic acid and sodium fluorescein have previously demonstrated potential as diagnostic adjuvants. Stereotactic biopsy with near-infrared (NIR) fluorophores has not been reported. We identified 5 representative cases using NIR fluorescent dye indocyanine green (ICG) administered in a high dose, delayed manner.
   METHODS: Five patients underwent second window indocyanine green (SWIG)-guided stereotactic biopsy for diagnosis of suspected glioma or tumor recurrence. Up to 5 mg/kg ICG was administered approximately 24 hours prior to surgery. Biopsies were conducted in the standard fashion, targeting regions of suspected tumor using intraoperative frameless navigation. Samples were examined intraoperatively under standard visible light and for fluorescence using conventional NIR imaging platforms. Findings were correlated with frozen and final tumor pathology for all cases.
   RESULTS: A total of 10 biopsy specimens were obtained. Three did not fluoresce and did not demonstrate tumor on preliminary or final pathology, including a non-gadolinium-enhancing sample taken proximal to the final target. The remaining 7 fluoresced, of which 6 contained tumor and 1 contained necrosis. Fluorescence was also noted in a patient with radiation treatment effect. Overall fluorescence characteristics were highly concordant with preliminary and final diagnoses.
   CONCLUSIONS: SWIG provides rapid intraoperative confirmation of pathologic brain tissue by permeating neoplastic or inflammatory brain tissue via a mechanism similar to that of gadolinium enhancement. SWIG-guided stereotactic biopsy can improve surgical efficiency by enhancing confidence in acquisition of target tissue.

AB BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to analyze the clinical outcomes of diagnostic transforaminal epidural injection (DTEI) in selective percutaneous endoscopic lumbar discectomy for multilevel disc herniation with monoradicular symptom.
   METHODS: A prospective randomized clinical study was performed from November 2013 to January 2018. A total of 99 consecutive patients with multilevel disc herniation and monoradicular symptom were divided randomly into the DTEI (n = 48) or control (n = 51) group based on a random number list. Operation time, blood loss, intraoperative fluoroscopy, and length of hospital stay were recorded and analyzed statistically. Visual analog scale (VAS) scores, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and the improved MacNab standard were used to assess the clinical outcomes of the 2 groups.
   RESULTS: No differences were observed between the 2 groups in aspect of baseline data. The patients of both groups had significant improvement in VAS and ODI scores compared with preoperative value. However, the postoperative VAS and ODI scores of the DTEI group were significantly lower compared with the control group. The clinical outcomes of the DTEI group according to the improved MacNab standard were significantly better than that of the control group.
   CONCLUSIONS: DTEI can improve the clinical outcomes of selective percutaneous endoscopic lumbar discectomy for multilevel disc herniation with monoradicular symptom, through improving the accuracy of confirmation of responsible level.

AB BACKGROUND: Decompression alone is a treatment option in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) and degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis (DLS). This study aims to describe the procedure of percutaneous transforaminal endoscopic ventral decompression technique and to demonstrate the clinical outcomes.
   METHODS: Two years of retrospective data were collected from 26 patients with predominant unilateral leg pain caused by LSS and low-grade DLS (Meyerding grades I and II). All patients underwent endoscopic ventral decompression by removing the posterosuperior margin underneath the slipping vertebral body, combined with dorsal decompression without excessive resection of facet joints. The surgical outcomes were assessed using the visual analog scale (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), modified MacNab criteria, and walking distance improvement evaluation.
   RESULTS: The mean age of the 18 women and 8 men was 69.2 years. The mean preoperative ODI and VAS of the leg and the back scores were 64.7 +/- 8.1, 7.0 +/- 1.4, and 3.0 +/- 1.2, respectively. All mean scores improved postoperatively to 31.4 +/- 5.6, 2.4 +/- 1.1, and 1.7 +/- 1.1 at the final follow-up. In 88.5% of cases, patients' estimated walking distance improved. The outcomes of the modified MacNab criteria showed that 81.3% of patients obtained good-to-excellent rate. There were no statistically significant differences between the percent slip of spondylolisthesis before surgery and at the end of follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: Based on the initial short-term follow-up results, transforaminal endoscopic ventral decompression by partially removing the posterosuperior margin underneath the slipping vertebral body, combined with dorsal decompression, might be an efficient alternative treatment for leg dominant symptoms in patients with LSS and low-grade DLS.

AB OBJECTIVE: To delineate the fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of patients with cervical spondylotic radiculopathy by diffusion tensor imaging and fiber bundle tracing.
   METHODS: Thirty patients with cervical spondylotic radiculopathy and 24 healthy volunteers were assessed using the International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury scale. All subjects underwent conventional sagittal T1- and T2-weighted imaging and horizontal 3-dimensional T2 driven equilibrium radiofrequency reset pulse and diffusion tensor imaging scan. The ADC and FA values were measured in the cervical nerve at most stenotic segment and heterolateral nonstenotic segment of patients.
   RESULTS: Fiber tractography revealed thinned and sparse nerve roots and disruption of the fiber bundles in patients with cervical spondylotic radiculopathy. The FA values of C5-C8 in healthy volunteers or heterolateral nonstenotic nerve of patients with cervical spondylotic radiculopathy were significantly greater than those of the stenotic cervical segments of patients with cervical spondylotic radiculopathy (both P < 0.01). Furthermore, the ADC values of C5-C8 in healthy volunteers or heterolateral nonstenotic nerve of patients with cervical spondylotic radiculopathy were significantly lower than those of the stenotic cervical segments of cervical spondylotic radiculopathy patients (both P < 0.01).
   CONCLUSIONS: Fiber tractography is capable of delineating microstructural changes of cervical nerve roots and cervical spondylotic radiculopathy exhibits significant changes in FA and ADC values.

AB OBJECTIVE: We compared the depression levels of juvenile and adolescent patients with idiopathic scoliosis who had undergone bracing and identified the factors that influenced the extent of depression in these patients.
   METHODS: Our study included 112 patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) and 96 patients with juvenile idiopathic scoliosis (JIS). The demographic characteristics and Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale, Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, and Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale for Children scores were evaluated to select the relative factors of depression in patients and parents. Cognitive evaluations, using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised scale, and an independent evaluation using the Functional Independence Measure for Children scale, were conducted.
   RESULTS: The mean Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale for Children score in the AIS group (38.3 +/- 3.0) was greater than that in the JIS group (23.8 +/- 4.6), a statistically significant difference (P < 0.05). Age at initial bracing, bracing duration, parental depression, Cobb angle at initial bracing, cognitive function, independence, peer problems, prosocial behaviors, emotional symptoms, and total difficulties were significant factors in our regression model for JIS. The AIS patients showed similar results, except for the age at initial bracing, cognitive function, and independence.
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients with AIS and JIS who had undergone bracing showed differences in the extent of depression, and female adolescents were more vulnerable to depressive psychological status. Higher levels of cognitive function and independence and older age at bracing, longer bracing duration, larger Cobb angle, negative parental attitudes, and undesirable Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire scores contributed to greater depression.

AB BACKGROUND: The purpose of this population-based case-control study was to evaluate analgesic use after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) caused by rupture of a saccular intracranial aneurysm (sIA).
   METHODS: The study consisted of 1187 patients alive 12 months after an sIA-SAH who were admitted to Kuopio University Hospital (KUH) between 1995 and 2014. Three controls, matched with age, sex, and birthplace, were included for each patient. Data on ruptured sIA cases admitted to KUH from a defined catchment population in Eastern Finland were obtained from the KUH intracranial aneurysm database. Analgesics were classified according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification system. Data on analgesic medication were retrieved from the Finnish national registry of prescribed medicines of the Social Insurance Institution of Finland.
   RESULTS: Among 1187 patients with sIA-SAH who were alive 12 months after admission, 83 (7.0%) commenced analgesics use within 12 months after the sIA-SAH versus 53 (1.5%) of the 3561 population controls. The results revealed significantly greater initiation rate of analgesic use among patients with sIA-SAH within a year after sIA-SAH as compared with that of matched population controls (odds ratio 5.0; 95% confidence interval 3.5-7.0; P < 0.001). Analgesic use commencement within 12 months of an sIA-SAH was independently associated with the presence of an intracerebral hematoma. Among patients, commencing analgesic use increased 11% when we compared a year before and a year after sIA-SAH.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that patients with sIA-SAH had an increased risk for new pain after sIA-SAH as compared with that of matched control population.

AB OBJECTIVE: We have discussed the clinical features and neuroimaging findings and investigated the correlations between the clinical characteristics and different neuroradiologic phenotypes of cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD).
   METHODS: A total of 1106 patients with a diagnosis of CSVD were enrolled. The demographic data, medical history, laboratory test results, and neuroimaging findings were retrieved for analysis. The differences in clinical parameters between patient groups were examined. The relationships between the clinical parameters and neuroradiologic phenotypes (i.e., white matter lesions [WMLs] and enlarged perivascular spaces) were assessed. The magnetic resonance imaging features were clustered using the fast clustering algorithm.
   RESULTS: Approximately one third of our patients presented with a lacune, which was associated with atrial fibrillation (P = 0.029), lacunar syndrome (P < 0.001), periventricular WMLs (P = 0.001), cerebral WMLs (P = 0.021), basal ganglia perivascular space grade (P < 0.001) and severity (P = 0.001), and semiovale perivascular space grade (P = 0.010) and severity (P = 0.002). Hypertension was associated with periventricular WMLs (P = 0.048), centrum semiovaleWMLs (P = 0.026), and basal ganglia perivascular space grade (P < 0.001) and severity (P < 0.001). A novel clustering algorithm was derived to stratify our cohort into 3 different groups according to the differing severity of the cerebral WMLs and perivascular space enlargement.
   CONCLUSION: The present study has provided a comprehensive analysis of the clinical correlation of characteristics and neuroradiologic phenotypes in patients with CSVD. The insights from these findings could be used to refine the management strategy for patients with CSVD.

AB BACKGROUND: It has been reported the distribution of bone cement in percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) has an impact on the curative effect. No studies have compared between confluent and separated cement pattern of bilateral bone cement in PKP for patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures.
   METHODS: Between 2010 and 2016, 1341 patients were enrolled and divided into 2 groups. Group A (n = 723), bilateral cement was confluent; Group B (n = 618), bilateral cement was separated. The visual analogue scale (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), anterior vertebral height (AVH), and local kyphotic angle (LKA) were obtained preoperatively, 2 days after surgery, and at the final follow-up to assess the functional and radiographic efficacy of the surgery.
   RESULTS: The VAS, ODI, AVH, and LKA 2 days after operation and at the final follow-up were significantly improved compared with the preoperative for both groups (P < 0.05). There existed no significant difference between groups at various time point in ODI, AVH, and LKA (P > 0.05). Group A showed better VAS than group B 2 days after surgery (1.91 +/- 0.98 vs. 2.35 +/- 0.78, P < 0.001), also with better pre-postoperative VAS change (6.23 +/- 0.76 vs. 5.75 +/- 1.02, P < 0.001). Multiple linear regression for pain relief degree revealed group A (P < 0.001), older age (P < 0.001), and more cement volume (P < 0.001) contribute to rapid improvement of back pain. The cement leakage rate was 3.7% in group A and 2.9% in group B, with no significant difference (P = 0.405).
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients achieved rapider pain relief with confluent rather than separated bilateral bone cement pattern in PKP for osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture.

AB BACKGROUND: The angioarchitecture of the spinal cord and microvascular changes after acute and subacute spinal cord injury ( SCI) have been reported in rodents. Microvascular changes after chronic SCI have not been explored. We characterized three-dimensional microvascular changes during the chronic phase of cervical hemicontusion SCI in rats.
   METHODS: At 12 weeks after 1.2-mm hemicontusion injury, microvascular parameters, including vascular volume, ratio of vascular volume to tissue volume, vascular number, and vascular separation, were measured at the epicenter and each cord segment, and the percentage and volume of spinal vessels with different diameters were measured by micro computed tomography at the injury segment.
   RESULTS: The 1.2-mm hemicontusion injury applied a compressive force of 1.050 +/- 0.103 N to the cord, resulting in a cavity and a significant decrease in microvasculature at the epicenter. The vascular volume, ratio of vascular volume to tissue volume, and vascular number of the C5 cord decreased by 40%, 38%, and 36% at 12 weeks after SCI, whereas vascular separation increased by 54% compared with the control group. In the chronic phase after SCI, the percentage and volume of spinal microvessels at the contusion segment decreased significantly (especially vessels with diameters <40 mu m).
   CONCLUSIONS: Blood supply to the cervical spinal cord is insufficient during the chronic phase of cervical hemicontusion SCI, especially in microvessels with diameters < 40 mu m. These results may provide a basis to explore microvascular changes of SCI during the chronic phase.

AB OBJECTIVE: Thalamic glioma is a type of midline glioma with poor outcomes. In the present study, we investigated the clinical and molecular features of thalamic gliomas in Chinese patients.
   METHODS: The data from 26 patients with thalamic glioma who had undergone surgery at Shanghai Huashan Hospital from January 2011 to August 2015 were retrospectively analyzed. Various clinical and molecular factors were evaluated to explore their effects on prognosis. H3K27M mutation status and its association with relevant molecular factors were also investigated.
   RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 38.88 years, and no significant difference was found in sex. The most common initial symptoms were headaches (38.46%; 10 of 26) and motor deficits (30.77%; 8 of 26). The H3K27M mutation was identified in 12 patients, and mutant thalamic glioma showed less frequent O-6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation compared with the wild-type group (P = 0.015; chi(1) test). Multivariate analysis showed that the H3K27M mutation was an independent unfavorable prognostic factor for overall survival. MGMT promoter unmethylation and the TP53 mutation were identified as negative prognostic factors for progression-free survival.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results revealed the clinical and molecular characteristics of thalamic glioma in China. Our data have shown the absence of MGMT promoter methylation in H3K27M mutant thalamic glioma, validating it as a hallmark of H3K27M mutant gliomas. In addition, H3K27M mutation was identified as the sole unfavorable prognostic factor on overall survival. MGMT promoter unmethylation and TP53 mutation were identified as independent prognostic factors for progression-free survival.

AB OBJECTIVE: There is sparse literature that investigates the adverse effects of postoperative pulmonary complication (PPCs) specifically in postcraniotomy tumor patients. In this study, we describe the rate of PPCs, determine predictive factors, and delineate associations with adverse outcomes.
   METHODS: The National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (2006-2016) database was queried for patients who underwent craniotomy for brain tumors. A total of 28,700 eligible patients were identified. Univariate tests and/or multivariate logistic regression were used to determine predictors of PPC and associations with adverse outcomes.
   RESULTS: A total of 19 predictors of PPC across 14 different categories were identified: age 65-79 years (odds ratio [OR] 1.6; P < 0.001), age >= 80 years (OR 2.3; P < 0.001), male sex (OR 1.3; P < 0.001), operative time >= 360 minutes (OR 4.3; P < 0.001), operative time 300-359 minutes (OR 2.5; P < 0.001), operative time 240-299 minutes (OR 1.8; P < 0.001), operative time 180-239 minutes (OR 1.3; P < 0.001), total functional dependence (OR 3.8; P < 0.001), partial functional dependence (OR 1.7; P < 0.001), insulin-dependent diabetes (OR 1.5; P < 0.001), preoperative dyspnea (OR 1.3; P = 0.01), chronic steroid use (OR 1.4; P < 0.001), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR 1.8; P < 0.001), preoperative leukocytosis (OR 1.4; P < 0.001), anemia (OR 1.2; P < 0.001), American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification >= 3 (OR 2.0; P < 0.001), emergency case status (OR 2.0; P < 0.001), and infratentorial lesions (OR 1.4; P < 0.001). PPCs were significantly associated with higher reoperation, readmission, and mortality rates as well as longer length of stay (univariate).
   CONCLUSIONS: There are several predictive factors of PPCs in patients that undergo surgical resection of brain tumors, and PPC development is associated with numerous adverse outcomes. It is critically important to understand and, if possible, mitigate controllable circumstances that may reduce morbidity and mortality associated with PPCs.

AB BACKGROUND: Soluble cluster of differentiation 40 ligand (sCD40L) is a member of the tumor necrosis factor family with proinflamatory and procoagulant effects. A previous study found higher serum sCD40L levels at day 1 of traumatic brain injury (TBI) in nonsurviving than surviving patients. Thus the objective of this study was to compare serum sCD40L levels during the first week of a severe TBI between surviving and nonsurviving patients and to determine whether it could be used as a mortality predictor biomarker.
   METHODS: In this multicenter study severe TBI patients (with Glasgow Coma Scale score <9) with an Injury Severity Score in noncranial item <9 were included. Serum sCD40L concentrations at days 1, 4, and 8 of TBI were determined. We performed receiver operating characteristic analyses to determine the capacity of 30-day TBI mortality prediction by serum sCD40L levels at days 1, 4, and 8 of TBI.
   RESULTS: We found that nonsurviving (n = 34) patients in comparison with surviving (n = 90) patients had higher sCD40L levels on days 1 (P < 0.001), 4 (P = 0.004), and 8 (P < 0.001) of TBI. We also found that the areas under curve of serum sCD40L concentrations at days 1, 4, and 8 of TBI to 30-day mortality prediction were 82% (P < 0.001), 72% (P = 0.01) and 83% (P < 0.001), respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: The existence of higher serum sCD40L levels in nonsurviving than surviving patients during the first week of TBI and fact that serum sCD40L levels during the first week of TBI can be used as a mortality predictor biomarker are the new findings of our study.

AB BACKGROUND: Multiple reports have attributed a prognostic value to routine blood tests results for patients with glioblastoma. However, these studies have reported conflicting results and have often had small sample sizes. We sought to validate the prognostic value of the described tests in an independent glioblastoma patient population.
   METHODS: We performed a retrospective single-center multivariable analysis of 497 patients with glioblastoma who had postoperatively undergone radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy to identify the prognostic value for median overall survival of hemoglobin, white blood cell, monocyte, neutrophil, leukocyte, and platelet counts, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, and lactate dehydrogenase. We also evaluated known prognostic factors for survival such as patient age, intervention type, IDH1 status, Karnofsky clinical performance status, and postoperative treatment modality.
   RESULTS: In a multivariable model, after correcting for multiple testing bias, biopsy alone (hazard ratio, 0.35; 95% confidence interval, 0.26-0.49; false discovery rateadjusted P < 0.001) and monotherapy after surgery (hazard ratio, 0.46; 95% confidence interval, 0.33-0.66; false discovery rate-adjusted P < 0.001) remained significantly associated with worse median overall survival. Patient age and Karnofsky performance status score >= 70 did not significantly influence survival in the multivariable model. No routine blood test included in the multivariable analysis was significantly associated with survival.
   CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, hemoglobin, white blood cell, monocyte, neutrophil, leukocyte, and platelet counts, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, and lactate dehydrogenase levels did not independently predict for overall survival in patients with glioblastoma.

AB BACKGROUND: Piezosurgery (PS) has gained increasing dispersion in neurosurgery. In pediatric neurosurgery, the experience is limited to craniosynostosis surgery. The present study assesses PS in the pediatric population, also considering outcomes and complications in cranial and spinal procedures.
   METHODS: All consecutive craniotomies and laminotomies, performed with PS (group A) or conventional osteotomes (group B) in the 2014-2017 period were reviewed. The following variables were analyzed: dural tears, estimated blood loss and need of transfusion, cosmetic outcome (Sloan score), and operative times. A review of the pertinent literature is included.
   RESULTS: 172 children were enrolled, 90 in group A and 82 in group B. The mean follow-up time was 2.1 years. A statistically significant difference in favor of group A was found about EBL (105 vs. 113 ml) and late outcome (Sloan class A 98.5% vs. 91.5%). PS also reduced the risk of dural tears (1 vs. 7 cases in groups A and B, respectively) and blood transfusion (52% vs. 55.5%) but without statistical significance. The operative times were significantly shorter in group B (13 vs. 23 minutes), although the newer PS plus (PSP) was demonstrated to significantly shorten these times compared with the traditional PS (3.5 vs. 6.5 minutes for orbitotomy and 7.5 vs. 9.5 minutes for hemicraniotomy).
   CONCLUSIONS: PS is a safe and effective tool that can be specifically recommended for bone splitting and graft, laminotomy, and craniotomy in cosmetically eloquent areas. The limit of operation times can be overcome by a learning curve in neurosurgery and PSP.

AB BACKGROUND: Persistent idiopathic facial pain (PIFP) can be refractory to conventional management approaches. Neuromodulatory procedures such as percutaneous trigeminal nerve stimulation (TNS) have been sparsely reported as potential treatment options for amelioration of debilitating refractory pain associated with PIFP. The present study investigated the use of percutaneous TNS in a series of patients with PIFP to evaluate the potential efficacy of pain relief.
   METHODS: We performed a retrospective medical record review for patients with PIFP who had presented to Emory University Hospital and had undergone TNS for PIFP. The primary outcomes were postoperative pain using the visual analog scale (VAS) for pain and morphine equivalent use. Descriptive statistics, mean +/- standard deviation, and the nonparametric Wilcoxon sign rank test were used, as appropriate. A P value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
   RESULTS: A total of 23 patients underwent percutaneous TNS for PIFP. Of the 23 patients, 20 (86.9%) reported a >50% improvement after trial stimulation. Of the patients who had received permanent TNS implants, 13 of 17 (76.4%) had VAS scores available. For these patients, the mean preoperative VAS score had decreased from 5.69 +/- 2.09 to 0.15 +/- 0.55 postoperatively. The VAS scores displayed a statistically significant decrease after TNS (P = 0.0014). A subset of 9 patients with available data also demonstrated a significant reduction in morphine equivalent use after TNS (before, 50.54 +/- 51.30; after, 25.83 +/- 33.58; P = 0.048).
   CONCLUSION: The results from the present study have indicated that percutaneous stimulation of the trigeminal nerve is efficacious in the treatment of PIFP and can significantly decrease morphine equivalent use. Further longitudinal studies are required to validate our results.

AB BACKGROUND: Rootlets of the lower cranial nerves create a web that limits microsurgical maneuverability in the cerebellomedullary cistern (CMC). The vagoaccessory triangle (VAT) and 2 triangles within it were defined to identify surgical routes to aneurysms of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA). Dividing the VAT into 2 triangles (suprahypoglossal [SHT] and infrahypoglossal [IHT]), although elegant, oversimplifies CMC anatomy. The triangle formed by the superior and inferior hypoglossal rootlets (hypoglossal-hypoglossal triangle [HHT]) needs consideration as well.
   METHODS: Far-lateral craniotomy was performed on 10 cadaveric heads bilaterally. Areas of CMC triangles were calculated. Relationships between the PICA origin and the adjacent triangles were analyzed. Vertebral artery (VA) exposure and clipping lengths were recorded for each triangle.
   RESULTS: The area of SHT was almost twice those of IHT and HHT. The average VA depth relative to VAT increased significantly when moving distally from proximal VA (P < 0.001), but VA exposure and clipping lengths were not significantly different between triangles. IHT, HHT, and SHT defined VA subsegments (V-4i, V-4h, and V-4s), with PICA most commonly originating from V-4h. Based on our cadaveric measurements, the V-4 subsegments were identified with 76% accuracy in angiograms.
   CONCLUSIONS: Based on this study, VAT should be divided into 3 triangles, not 2. Splayed rootlets of cranial nerve XII and multiple outlet foramina create an important space different from the previously recognized SHT and IHT. These triangles provide corridors to vascular pathologies. V4 subsegments may be approximated from imaging studies and may help with preoperative planning.

AB OBJECTIVE: There are limited reports examining delirium in cohorts of neurosurgical patients across inpatient settings without separation based on subspecialty distinction. It is of interest to identify consistent delirium risk factors across various cranial pathologies and inpatient settings that will inform future interventional studies.
   METHODS: Delirium rates, patient and hospitalization risk factors, and clinical outcomes in 235 patients undergoing a cranial procedure were examined in a retrospective fashion.
   RESULTS: Fifty-two (22.1%) patients experienced delirium during their hospital stay. Patient factors predictive of delirium on univariate logistic regression were older age, a diagnosis of hydrocephalus or intracranial infection, transfer from an outside hospital, and admission through the emergency department. Hospitalization factors predictive of delirium included longer length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, abnormal sodium values preceding delirium, a new postoperative infection, and the presence of a neurologic deficit. Using recursive partitioning, age >= 72.56 years and ICU length of stay >= 5 days were identified as critical thresholds for predicting delirium (odds ratio [OR] 4.61 and 18.2, respectively). On multivariate logistic regression analysis, age (unit OR 1.05), length of ICU stay (unit OR 1.2), and a neurologic deficit (OR 5.4) were predictive of delirium. Furthermore, delirium was also significantly associated with a longer length of admission as well as decreased likelihood for discharge home.
   CONCLUSIONS: Delirium is a frequent occurrence after neurosurgery with older age, longer ICU stay, and a neurologic deficit being consistent risk factors across inpatient settings. These results help identify at-risk patients for delirium on a neurosurgical service to enact interventions preemptively.

AB BACKGROUND: Dorsal spinal instrumentation with cervical pedicle screws (CPS) and rod constructs is performed for numerous pathologies of the cervical spine, although technically demanding. Screw misplacement is biomechanically disadvantageous and carries the risk of neurovascular sequelae. The aim of this study was to assess the accuracy of patient-specific, template-guided CPS placement from C2 to C7 compared with the freehand technique.
   METHODS: Patient-specific targeting guides were used for placement of 3.5 mm CPS from C2 to C7 in 4 cadaveric specimens. Template-guided instrumentation was randomized for each cervical level and side and the contralateral side instrumented likewise but with the freehand technique. No fluoroscopy was used at all, and the spinal canal was not opened for the freehand technique. Accuracy was assessed by computed tomography, grading perforations using a 2-mm increment method, and time efficiency was compared between the 2 techniques.
   RESULTS: In total, 48 screws were inserted with an equal distribution of 24 screws (50%) in each of the 2 groups. Outer pedicle width averaged 5.1 +/- 1.0 mm (range 2.7-7.8); 66.7% (n = 16) of template-guided versus 20.8% (n = 5) of freehand CPS were fully contained within the pedicle (P = 0.001), whereas 91.7% (n = 22) versus 50% (n = 12) were within the <2 mm "safe" zone (P = 0.001). The mean time for instrumentation per level and side was 03:09 +/- 01:37 minutes for the template-guided versus 02:32 +/- 01:04 minutes for the freehand technique (P = 0.132).
   CONCLUSIONS: In a cadaver model, template-guided CPS placement has a significantly greater accuracy than the freehand technique. This accuracy is comparable with navigated techniques reported in the literature.

DT Article
DE Hyperostosis; Intraorbital extension; Recurrence; Spheno-orbital
   meningioma; Surgical strategy
ID GRADE; RADIOSURGERY; RADIOTHERAPY; RESECTION; SERIES
AB OBJECTIVE: Spheno-orbital meningioma (SOM) is a rare intracranial tumor that arises at the sphenoid wing, extends into the orbit, and is associated with hyperostosis of the sphenoid bone. These tumors often invade important neurovascular structures around the orbital apex, superior orbital fissure, and cavernous sinus. Aggressive tumor removal could achieve acceptable control; however, residual tumor can regrow. In this article, our surgical management and long-term outcomes are described.
   METHODS: Retrospectively, 12 patients with SOM who were treated surgically over a 21-year period were included. The clinical features and long-term tumor control were evaluated.
   RESULTS: Participants comprised 12 patients (5 men and 7 women). Mean follow-up was 74.4 months (range, 10-262 months). Ten patients (83%) were identified as World Health Organization grade 1 (WHO-I), and 2 patients (17%) were identified as WHO grade 2 (WHO-II). We encountered 4 recurrences, 2 of which needed additional surgeries. One patient with WHO-I (10%) experienced recurrence 10 years after the initial surgery and required a second surgery. Two patients with WHO-I (20%) showed slight regrowth of residual tumor around the superior orbital fissure; nevertheless, additive therapy was not recommended. Despite radical tumor resection, including eyeball and adjunctive radiotherapy for 1 patient with WHO-II, tumor recurrence in the posterior fossa was documented 19 years after the initial aggressive surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: SOM follows a relatively benign clinical course given the invasive radiologic findings. Abnormal bone resection is paramount to prevent early-stage recurrence. Although intradural residual tumor might regrow, additional surgery could achieve reasonable long-term tumor control with better outcome.

DE Chronic subdural hematoma; Cone-beam computed tomography; Embolization;
   Hematoma membrane; Middle meningeal artery
AB OBJECTIVE: Chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) is generally treated by burr-hole irrigation, but it can recur despite repeating these procedures. Embolization of the middle meningeal artery (MMA) has recently been proposed as a curative treatment for CSDH, but evidence for the indication and timing of MMA embolization is not definitive. The present study retrospectively analyzed the effects and safety of MMA embolization among patients with persistent CSDH recurrence.
   METHODS: We retrospectively assessed data from 381 consecutive patients who underwent burr-hole irrigation for CSDH between 2009 and 2017. Recurrent symptomatic ipsilateral CSDH in 71 (18%) patients was treated by a second burr-hole irrigation, and 20 of them had a further symptomatic CSDH recurrence thereafter. Those with persistent ipsilateral CSDH recurrence were treated by MMA embolization. Before the MMA embolization procedures, the amount of hematoma membrane enhancement determined using superselective MMA angiography-DynaCT imaging was classified into 3 stages.
   RESULTS: Embolization of the MMA proceeded without perioperative complications or further CSDH recurrence. The interval between recurrence and the amount of hematoma membrane enhancement significantly correlated (first to second and second to third treatments: P = 0.012 and P = 0.017, respectively). The frequency of bilateral CSDH was significantly higher and the recurrence interval between the first and second treatments was significantly shorter in the repeated recurrences group compared with the recurrence group (P = 0.023 and P = 0.006, respectively).
   CONCLUSIONS: Repeatedly recurrent CSDH can be safely treated and cured by MMA embolization. Hematoma membrane enhancement pattern using DynaCT images can predict repeated recurrences CSDH.

AB BACKGROUND: When diagnosed simultaneously, obesity, diabetes, and hypertension form a medical constellation called metabolic syndrome (MetS). The prevalence of MetS in Western cultures has been on a steady increase and MetS has been associated with increased postoperative complications in multiple surgical settings.
   OBJECTIVE: In this study, we evaluate the relationship between MetS and the outcomes of craniotomy for supratentorial brain tumor.
   METHODS: Cases of craniotomy for supratentorial brain tumors were extracted from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program for 2012-2016. The 15,136 patients identified were divided into 2 cohorts based on the presence (4.1%) or absence (95.9%) of MetS. We compared the 2 cohorts for preoperative comorbidities, intraoperative details, and postoperative morbidity and mortality.
   RESULTS: Patients in the MetSD cohort were significantly older (63.4 vs. 56.1 years) and were more likely to show comorbidities of various organ systems (all P <= 0.05). However, operative times were similar (P = 0.573). The number of medical complications was almost double in patients with MetS (15.8% vs. 8.5%; P <= 0.001). Unplanned readmissions (14.6% vs. 10.4%; P = 0.004), reoperations (6.9% vs. 4.6%; P = 0.007), and mortality (5.6% vs. 2.9%; P <= 0.001) were also more frequent in our MetSD group. Nevertheless, surgical complications localized to the operative site were not statistically increased (7.4% vs. 5.8%; P = 0.098).
   CONCLUSIONS: A diagnosis of MetS does not seem to be associated with increased rates of surgical site events. However, neurosurgeons should be aware that these patients have a significantly higher likelihood of general medical complications, readmissions, reoperations, and death.

AB BACKGROUND: Meningioma subtypes are one of the most common key points to the treatment and prognosis of patients. The purpose of this study was to investigate the differential diagnostic value of radiomics features on meningioma.
   METHODS: A total of 241 patients with meningioma who had undergone tumor resection were randomly selected including 80 with meningothelial meningioma, 80 with fibrous meningioma, and 81 with transitional meningioma. These meningiomas were divided into 4 groups including: meningothelial versus fibrous (group 1), fibrous versus transitional (group 2), meningothelial versus transitional (group 3), and meningothelial versus fibrous versus transitional (group 4). All patients were examined using the same magnetic resonance scanner (GE 3.0 T) and the preoperative contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images were available. Radiomics features from the contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images of 241 patients were evaluated by 2 experienced radiology specialists.
   RESULTS: A total of 385 radiomics features were extracted from the images of each patient. Several preprocessing methods were applied on the radiomics dataset to reduce the redundancy and highlight differences between different meningioma before the Fisher discrimination analysis was adopted and leave one out cross validation methods were used for the model validation. The differentiation accuracies of the Fisher discriminant analysis model for groups 1, 2, 3, and 4 were 99.4%, 98.8%, 100% and 100%, respectively; leave one out cross validation method was achieved for group 1, 2, 3, and 4 with the accuracies of 91.3%, 95.0%, 100%, and 94.2%, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: Radiomics features and the combined Fisher discriminant analysis could provide satisfactory performance in the preoperative differential diagnosis of meningioma subtypes and enable the potential ability for clinical application.U

AB OBJECTIVE: Bypass surgery is a special technique used to treat complex internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysms. The aim of this retrospective study is to provide a comprehensive description of treatment and outcome of complex ICA aneurysms at different ICA segments (cavernous, supraclinoid, ICA bifurcation) treated with bypass procedures.
   METHODS: We identified 39 consecutive patients with 41 complex ICA aneurysms that were treated with 44 bypass procedures between 1998 and 2016. We divided the aneurysms into 3 anatomic subgroups to review our treatment strategy. All the imaging studies and medical records were reviewed for relevant information.
   RESULTS: The aneurysm occlusion (n = 34, 83%) or flow modification (n = 5, 12%) was achieved in 39 aneurysms (95%). The long-term bypass patency rate was 68% (n = 30). Minor postoperative ischemia or hemorrhage was commonly seen (n = 20, 51%), but large-scale strokes were rare (n = 1, 3%). Preoperative dysfunction of extraocular muscles (cranial nerves III, IV, and VI) showed low-to-moderate improvement rates (20%-50%). Preoperative vision disturbance (cranial nerve II) improved seldom (22%). At the latest follow-up (mean; 51 months) 29 patients (74%) were independent (modified Rankin Scale <= 2).
   CONCLUSIONS: Bypass surgery for complex ICA aneurysms is a feasible treatment method with an acceptable risk profile. Patients should be informed of the uncertainty related to improvement of pretreatment cranial nerve dysfunctions.

AB OBJECTIVE: Frame-based stereotaxy represents the gold standard for biopsy of deep-seated lesions. Visual control of possible bleeding in these lesions is not possible. Neuroendoscopic biopsy represents an alternative procedure for tissue sampling in deep-seated intraventricular lesions. The authors present a technique for transventricular-navigated endoscopic biopsy of lesions that are located in the paraventricular region.
   METHODS: Biopsy of paraventricular pathologies was performed in 6 male and 6 female patients between March 2013 and September 2018. The patient age ranged from 18 to 82 years. All patients underwent a pure endoscopic procedure over a burr hole trepanation supported by frameless navigation of the sedan probe.
   RESULTS: Histologic diagnoses were established in all biopsies. In all patients, a direct control of the biopsy area was feasible, and hemostasis could be obtained. In 5 patients, endoscopic third ventriculostomy was performed first due to obstructive hydrocephalus. In 1 patient suffering from obstructive hydrocephalus, a pellucidotomy was performed. In 9 cases, the initial postoperative course was uneventful. Three patients suffered from persistent hydrocephalus and had to be treated with ventriculoperitoneal shunt insertion.
   CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopically conducted biopsies with the aid of navigated tracking of the probe represent a possible additional technique in selected paraventricular intraparenchymal pathologies. The endoscopic approach enables the direct visualization of the intraventricular surface and its vessels. In contrast to standard stereotactic biopsy, direct visual control of hemostasis can be obtained even in paraventricular tumors.

TI Surgical and Endovascular Comprehensive Treatment Outcomes of Unruptured
   Intracranial Aneurysms: Reduction of Treatment Bias
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Endovascular treatment; Intracranial aneurysm; Microsurgical clipping
ID CEREBRAL ANEURYSMS; COILING; SAFETY
AB BACKGROUND: Determining the risks of treatment of unruptured intracranial aneurysms is critical in the decision-making process of management. Most studies have reported the results for endovascular or surgical management. Our objective was to better delineate the risk estimates for unruptured intracranial aneurysms treated with surgical or endovascular techniques in a comprehensive fashion, according to the patients' risk profiles.
   METHODS: Data were gathered from 553 patients with 658 unruptured intracranial aneurysms treated at a single institution from 2014 to 2017. The decision to treat was determined by a projected morbidity that was lower than the natural history rupture risk. Data on aneurysm size, location, patient age, and outcome at the last clinical visit (modified Rankin scale scores) were collected and analyzed retrospectively.
   RESULTS: The mean patient age was 59 years, and the mean lesion size was 7.3 mm. Microsurgical clipping was used in 251 lesions (38.2%), endovascular coiling in 70 (10.6%), stent-assisted coiling in 89 (13.5%), and a pipeline embolization device in 248 (37.7%). Complications from the procedures or during hospital admission occurred 66 lesions (10% of the total). Of these 66 complications, 28 (4.32% of the total) were non-neurological, treated, and resolved without permanent morbidity. Neurologic complications occurred in 38 procedures (5.7% of the total). Of these, 7 (1%) resulted in a permanent poor outcome (modified Rankin scale score, 3-6).
   CONCLUSION: Aneurysmal obliteration using endovascular and surgical approaches in a comprehensive fashion has low treatment risks for unruptured aneurysms. The nomograms generated are useful in the discussion with patients and families regarding the risks of total institutional treatment of unruptured aneurysms.

AB BACKGROUND: Although transarterial embolization (TAE) with Onyx has become popular for the treatment of dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs), transvenous embolization (TVE), surgery, and radiosurgery have continued to have a role. The aim of the present study was to compare the treatment outcomes stratified by the different treatment modalities.
   METHODS: The data from 92 patients with DAVFs treated from January 2009 to June 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. The treatment strategies were decided by a multidisciplinary team according to the patient's clinical status and angiographic findings. The clinical and radiologic data were analyzed and correlated with the treatment modality.
   RESULTS: A total of 101 procedures were performed in the 92 patients. TAE, TVE, surgery, and radiosurgery were performed in 31, 49, 12, and 9 procedures, respectively. Complete and near complete occlusion was achieved in 13 cases treated with TAE (41.9%), 41 treated with TVE (83.7%), and 10 with surgery (83.3%), as shown on immediate postprocedural angiography (P < 0.001). Retreatment was needed in 9 patients in the TAE group and none in the TVE or surgery groups (P < 0.001). Surgery (n = 1), TVE (n = 3), TAE (n = 1), and radiosurgery (n = 4) were used for patients requiring retreatment. At the last follow-up examination (mean, 26.5 +/- 23.9 months), 66 of 72 DAVFs (91.6%) showed angiographic complete occlusion. Clinically, the initial symptoms had disappeared or improved in 87 of 90 patients (96.7%) at the last follow-up evaluation (mean, 26.4 +/- 26.8 months).
   CONCLUSIONS: Even in the Onyx era, other treatment modalities still have important roles, as shown in the present study. Therefore, the selection of the appropriate treatment modality should be individualized by the angiographic findings and clinical symptoms.

AB OBJECTIVE: c-Met has been shown to be associated with tumor growth in several human cancers. This study aims to evaluate the correlation between the c-Met expression and histopathologic/clinical characteristics.
   METHODS: A total of 153 patients with histologically defined World Health Organization grade IIeIV diffuse astrocytic and oligodendroglial tumors were analyzed.
   RESULTS: For each histopathologic diagnosis, the number of cases and positive rate of c-Met expression are as follows: oligodendroglioma, IDH-mutant, and 1p19q codeletion (OD): 16 cases, 6.3%; anaplastic oligodendroglioma, IDHmutant, and 1p19q codeletion (AO): 11 cases, 36.4%; diffuse astrocytoma (DA), IDH-mutant: 21 cases, 28.6%; anaplastic astrocytoma (AA), IDH-mutant: 15 cases, 20%; glioblastoma, IDH-mutant: 2, 100%, DA, IDH-wildtype: 9 cases, 33.3%; AA, IDH-wildtype: 20 cases, 30.0%; and glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype: 59 cases, 52.5%. c-Met expression was correlated with progression-free survival in oligodendroglial tumors and glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype. Furthermore, it was correlated with overall survival in AO, oligodendroglial tumors, DA, IDH-mutant, DA, IDH-wildtype, and glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype, and tend to be correlated with overall survival in IDHmutant lower-grade astrocytic tumors.
   CONCLUSIONS: c-Met expression was revealed to be a useful marker for prognosis prediction in IDH-mutant lower-grade gliomas and glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype, representing a new independent prognostic marker that can be easily measured.

DT Article
DE Arteriovenous malformation; Endothelial cell; KRAS; Somatic mutation
ID SMOOTH-MUSCLE-CELLS; PROGNOSTIC VALUE; EXPRESSION; ACTIVATION; RISK
AB BACKGROUND: Brain arteriovenous malformations (BAVMs) are vascular malformations composed of tangles of abnormally developed vasculature without capillaries. Abnormal shunting of arteries and veins is formed, resulting in high-pressure vascular channels, which potentially lead to rupture. BAVMs are generally considered a congenital disorder. But clinical evidence regarding involution, regrowth, and de novo formation argue against the static condition of this disease. Recently, the presence of the somatic activating KRAS mutations in more than half of BAVM cases was reported, suggesting the role of KRAS function in the pathogenesis.
   METHODS: KRAS mutation in codon35 (G -> A, G12D; G -> T, G12V) was examined by a digital polymerase chain reaction analysis using genome purified from paraffin-embedded slides of human BAVMs. We also examined protein expression of KRAS G12D in lesions to corroborate results from digital polymerase chain reaction analysis.
   RESULTS: We detected codon35 G -> A mutation in 15 (39.5%) among 38 samples and codon35 G -> T mutation in 10 (27.0%) among 37 samples we could assess mutations. There were no samples positive for both codon35 G -> A and G -> T mutation. The ratio of codon35 G -> A mutation ranged from 0.60% to 12.28% and that of G -> T was from 1.20% to 8.99%. We next examined protein expression of KRAS G12D in BAVM lesions in immunohistochemistry. A KRAS G12D mutant was detected mainly in endothelial cells of dilated vessels in lesions.
   CONCLUSIONS: KRAS mutations in codon35 were detected in about two thirds of specimens examined. KRAS function may actively contribute to the pathobiology of BAVM and can become a therapeutic target.

ID RECURRENCE
AB OBJECTIVE: A subset of patients with chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) remains refractory to standard treatment with hematoma drainage by burr-hole craniotomy and irrigation. We recently reported the usefulness of middle meningeal artery (MMA) embolization for intractable CSDH in patients with multiple intractable risk factors. We present the midterm outcomes of MMA embolization in patients with intractable CSDHs.
   METHODS AND RESULTS: Seventeen consecutive patients (average age, 76.4 years; 12 men [71%]) underwent MMA embolization of CSDH from January 2014 to July 2017. Earlier interventions included embolization using N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate (although trisacryl gelatin microspheres were used in recent cases), followed by burr-hole craniotomy and irrigation in all cases. None of the patients experienced perioperative complications or postoperative recurrence. The modified Rankin Scale scores, which were unfavorable at admission, improved significantly at discharge but were comparable to those at the time of hospitalization when measured during the follow-up period. Although the patients required rehospitalization at other departments for unrelated causes, none required rehospitalization in our department.
   CONCLUSIONS: Despite the known unfavorable outcomes of patients with intractable CSDHs, MMA embolization was not associated with recurrent CSDH or rehospitalization in our department in the current case series. MMA embolization should be considered a preferred therapeutic option for intractable CSDHs.

AB OBJECTIVE: To introduce an effective strategy to treat patients with chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) that can achieve a low recurrence rate and good outcome.
   METHODS: Surgical patients with CSDH from August 2011 to May 2017 in our hospital were collected retrospectively. An exhaustive drainage strategy to treat CSDH with burr-hole craniostomy was conducted. All patients were drained, and catheter was removed when natural drainage ceased or when drainage was complete using urokinase. Clinical characteristics were reviewed and analyzed. Following this strategy, predictors of recurrence requiring reoperation and outcome were analyzed.
   RESULTS: In total, 1126 patients with CSDH who were treated with burr-hole craniostomy were included. Using the exhaustive drainage strategy, recurrence rate was only 1.9% (21/1117) with follow-up rate of 99.2%. 97.0% (1092/1117) of patients gained good outcome (modified Rankin scale scores 0-3) at 6 months after discharge. Postoperative hematoma volume (P = 0.001, B = 0.028, Exp (B) = 1.028, 95% CI 1.011-1.046), diabetes (P = 0.022, B = 1.082, Exp (B) = 2.950, 95% CI 1.169-7.440), bilateral hematoma (P = 0.011, B = 1.213, Exp (B) = 3.363, 95% CI 1.323-8.547), and complications (P = 0.013, B = 1.483, Exp (B) = 4.408, 95% CI 1.365-14.235) significantly increased the probability of recurrence. In contrast, use of urokinase (P = 0.007, B = L1.435, Exp (B) = 0.238, 95% CI 0.085-0.671) reduced recurrence. Finally, age (P = 0.026, B = 0.056, Exp (B) = 1.057, 95% CI 1.007-1.110), complications (P < 0.001, B = 1.710, Exp (B) = 5.529, 95% CI 2.104-14.531), and Bender grade (P < 0.001, B = 1.165, Exp B) = 3.205, 95% CI 1.325-7.750) were significant predictors of outcome.
   CONCLUSIONS: The exhaustive drainage strategy is safe and effective for reducing recurrence rate and achieving good outcome in patients with CSDH. This procedure merits recommendation in clinical practice.

TI Effects of Bemiparin Sodium Versus Dabigatran Etexilate After
   Anastomosis in Rat Carotid Arteries on the Development of Neointima and
   Thrombolytic Efficacy
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article

   Neointima; Thrombosis
ID HEPARIN
AB BACKGROUND: Revascularization before infarct development after cerebral ischemia may affect morbidity. The success of revascularization can be less than expected because of spontaneous thrombosis or restenosis with intimal hyperplasia. The aim of this study was to compare dabigatran etexilate, a direct thrombin inhibitor, with bemiparin sodium, a second-generation low-molecular-weight heparin, after carotid artery anastomosis.
   METHODS: This study used 24 randomly selected Sprague-Dawley rats. The rats were separated into 3 equal groups: group 1 (control group); group 2 (dabigatran group), in which dabigatran 10 mg/kg was orally administered for 7 days; and group 3 (bemiparin group), in which bemiparin 250 IU/kg was subcutaneously administered for 7 days. The right-side carotid artery of rats was used for anastomosis and the left-side carotid artery was used for the control. The carotid artery was explored and transected. Anastomosis was applied using 10/0 polypropylene sutures. After 7 days of treatment, the right and left carotid arteries were removed. Lumen diameter, lumen area, tunica media thickness, edema, vessel wall injury, intimal hyperplasia, thrombus, and inflammation were evaluated in tissue biopsy specimens.
   RESULTS: Bemiparin used after anastomosis caused less thickening of tunica media and reduced intimal hyperplasia but did not decrease lumen diameter and area. Dabigatran increased edema and inflammation but did not prevent intimal hyperplasia.
   CONCLUSIONS: Bemiparin reduced intimal hyperplasia and prevented thrombosis angiogenesis, but dabigatran did not prevent intimal hyperplasia, and its anticoagulation effect was more than the antithrombotic effect.

ID VESTIBULAR SCHWANNOMA RESECTION; REMOVAL
AB BACKGROUND: Endoscopy is now a staple of any neurosurgical practice. The versatility of this approach and gratifying results has resulted in its increased popularity. The objective of this paper is to report our experience of managing various cerebellopontine angle (CPA) pathologies by endoscopic keyhole retromastoid suboccipital craniectomy (RMSO) approach.
   METHODS: A retrospective review of the medical records of patients operated in our department by endoscopic keyhole RMSO approach was done along with a collection of relevant patient particulars.
   RESULTS: Forty-four patients (24 men and 20 women) were operated via an endoscopic keyhole RMSO approach for various lesions in and around the CPA. The craniectomy was of 2.0-2.5 cm in size. An endoscope was used as the sole visualizing tool throughout the procedure in all cases. Primarily 2 kinds of pathologies were approached: neoplasms, mostly benign (n = 33), and vascular loops (n = 11). The extent of excision in 33 tumor cases was gross total (n [ 20), near total (n = 12), and subtotal (n = 1). In cases of a vascular loop, microvascular decompression was performed. Anatomic facial nerve preservation was ensured in all cases of vascular loops and in 30 tumor cases. Postoperative complications included new-onset/worsening of facial nerve paresis (n = 12, 27.3%), 9 of which improved in follow-up, transient facial hypoesthesia (n = 2, 4.5%), transient abducens paresis (n = 4, 9%), transient lower cranial nerve paresis (n = 3, 6.8%), pseudomeningocele (n = 1, 2.3%), cerebrospinal fluid leak with meningitis (n = 1, 2.3%) and operative site hematoma (n = 1, 2.3%) which required evacuation.
   CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic keyhole RMSO approach is minimally invasive and yields an excellent outcome in the management of various CPA lesions.

TI Modified Cranioplasty Technique Using 3-Dimensional Printed Implants in
   Preventing Temporalis Muscle Hollowing
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE 3D Printing; Cranioplasty; Temporalis muscle hollowing
ID DEEP
AB BACKGROUND: Temporalis muscle (TM) hollowing is a complication of cranioplasty which diminishes the aesthetical outcome of the surgery and results in suboptimal functional outcome. We present and compare a modified split-temporalis muscle elevated margin cranioplasty using 3-dimensional printed titanium implant with conventional 3-dimensional printed titanium implant cranioplasty to determine an effective treatment method.
   METHODS: A modified 3-dimensional printed cranial implant was designed where the anteroinferior border of the implant was extended and elevated between the frontozygomatic suture and root of zygomatic process. Furthermore, the implant was placed in between superficial and deep layers of the temporalis muscle. Aesthetical evaluation was carried out at the outpatient clinic, and a quantitative analysis showing the percentage difference in length of the operated and nonoperated sides was performed.
   RESULTS: For both conventional and augmented groups, there were 0% major or minor complications. Out of 10 conventional cranioplasty patients, there were 3 cases of mild and 1 case of severe TM hollowing, whereas for 10 augmented cranioplasty patients, there was only 1 patient with mild TM hollowing. When a quantitative analysis was carried out, the overall percentage difference in length at the coronal view for conventional and augmented cranioplasty was -2.17% and 0.07%, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: The augmented cranioplasty leads to superior aesthetical outcome, and the quantitative analysis also supports the efficacy of augmented cranioplasty. The surgery is technically simpler than the conventional method, therefore lowering the risk of surgical complications. Therefore, we hope that the modified cranioplasty method will be considered as an effected cranioplasty method for preventing TM hollowing.

   Minimally invasive surgery; Planning
ID PEDICLE SCREWS; ACCURACY; FIXATION; SURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: Pedicle screw instrumentation is a standard procedure in lumbar spinal fusion. The cortical bone trajectory (CBT) screw is an alternative technique, less invasive but harder to perform. The identification of the entry point and the appropriate direction can be tricky especially to the surgeons just at the beginning. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the reliability of pre-operative computed tomography (CT) planning in the CBT screw placement.
   METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 82 patients who underwent a single-level posterior lumbar arthrodesis with CBT screws. The correct entry point and the best trajectory were identified on a 3-dimensional (3D) multi-planar reconstruction CT view. The concordance between achieved and planned trajectories was assessed on a postoperative CT.
   RESULTS: A total of 328 screws was positioned. The average entry point distance from the target was 1.1 mm (standard deviation, +/- 0.15 mm). In 301 screws (91.8%), the obtained trajectory differed no more than 2 degrees from the planned one. No screws misplaced or new neurological deficit was recorded.
   CONCLUSIONS: The CBT screw placement is a great alternative to the pedicle screw. Accurate preoperative 3D planning is useful to predict the entry point and the direction with accuracy similar to navigation systems, avoiding its costs and technical difficulties. The 3D CT planning is helpful in the customization of spine surgery, and the results underline the radiological reliability of this technique.

AB BACKGROUND: Optimal transfusion thresholds have been extensively studied for various surgical procedures; however, no transfusion threshold has been set for patients undergoing complex spine surgery. The aim of this study was to compare postoperative outcomes relative to perioperative hemoglobin (Hb) levels for patients undergoing complex spine surgery for adult spinal deformity and to evaluate impact of blood transfusion timing on clinical outcomes.
   METHODS: Retrospective chart review of patients with adult spinal deformity undergoing spine surgery lasting >6 hours or involving >= 6 levels of fusion was performed. Patients were divided into 2 cohorts based on whole hospitalization Hb nadir <9.0 g/dL versus >= 9.0 g/dL.
   RESULTS: Among 104 patients, 55 (52.9%) had Hb nadir <9.0 g/dL. Compared with the cohort with higher Hb nadir, patients with Hb nadir <9.0 g/dL were more likely to be female (84.5% vs. 65.3%, P = 0.016), present with lower preoperative Hb (12.6 = 1.5] g/dL vs. 13.8 [1.2] g/dL, P < 0.001), experience greater change in Hb after surgery (4.4 [1.5] g/dL vs. 3.7 [1.5] g/dL, P = 0.030), receive a postoperative blood transfusion (69.1% vs. 44.9%, P = 0.013), and have a longer length of stay (9.1 [4.8] days vs. 6.2 [3.2] days, P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: In patients with adult spinal deformity undergoing complex spine surgery, earlier targeted blood transfusions during surgery, rather than in the postoperative period, may lead to improved postoperative outcomes.

AB OBJECTIVE: Recently, in modern neurosurgery, a tendency toward low-traumatic surgical approaches has become clear. To provide a minimal degree of injury to the brain tissue, we have offered microsurgical approaches through a burr hole.
   METHODS: From February 2016 to November 2017, 200 microsurgical interventions through a single burr hole with a diameter of 14 mm were performed. The age of the patients varied from 16 to 79 years. The female/male ratio was 1.6:1. In 176 cases, the procedure was performed on an intracranial mass lesion in various locations. In the remaining 24 cases, selective amygdalohippocampectomy was performed in patients with hippocampal sclerosis.
   RESULTS: Various surgical approaches were used, including transcortical in 81 (40.5%), retrosigmoid in 38 (19%), subtemporal in 32 (16%), infratentorial supracerebellar in 25 (12.5%), interhemispheric in 17 (8.5%), telovelar in 5 (2.5%), and eyebrow in 2. The extent of lesion removal was evaluated in 167 patients for whom maximal tumor resection had been planned before surgery. Gross total and near total removal was achieved in 145 patients (87%), subtotal in 15 patients (9%), and partial in 7 patients (4%). The operative time ranged from 35 to 300 minutes (median, 80). The interval to extubation postoperatively varied from 5 minutes to 5 days (median, 70 minutes). Of the 200 patients, 195 (97.5%) were mobilized during the first 3 postoperative days.
   CONCLUSIONS: Burr hole microsurgery provides the ability to perform successful surgery on patients with the most diverse intracranial pathological features through a smaller opening than that used for keyhole surgery.

AB OBJECTIVE: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is the reference standard for radiotherapy for pituitary adenomas but has been limited to lesions with sufficient distance (i.e., >3 mm) from the optic apparatus. We used marginless, fractionated (i.e., 25-28 fractions) stereotactic radiotherapy and the CyberKnife to treat pituitary adenomas that were not eligible for SRS. We present the clinical outcomes, including local control, endocrine function, and toxicity from modern fractionated radiotherapy.
   METHODS: A total of 53 patients were treated for pituitary adenomas within 3 mm of the optic apparatus. The primary endpoint was tumor control with the secondary endpoints of vision and pituitary function preservation and endocrine control in hormone-secreting tumors.
   RESULTS: The tumor control rate as measured on magnetic resonance imaging as either stable or decreased in size was 98.1% (52 of 53) at a mean follow-up of 32.5 months (range, 3-77). All patients experienced preservation or improvement of their preexisting vision status. No change in pituitary function was noted in 52 of the 53 patients (98.1%). One patient experienced worsening of pituitary function secondary to pituitary apoplexy that occurred 4 months after treatment. The endocrine control rate in hormone-secreting tumors was 75% (6 of 8).
   CONCLUSIONS: Marginless, fractionated CyberKnife radiotherapy demonstrated excellent local tumor control and endocrine control rates, comparable to those with SRS, with preservation of vision in patients with adenomas in close proximity to the optic pathway.

AB OBJECTIVE: The aim of present study was to assess the predictive value of the admission prognostic nutrition index (PNI), controlling nutritional status (CONUT) associated with delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI), and 3-month neurological outcomes after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH).
   METHODS: The clinical data from 252 patients with aSAH were retrospectively analyzed. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to assess the predictive ability of the PNI and CONUT score and identify the cutoff point. Multivariate analysis was conducted to assess the role of the PNI and CONUT score in predicting for DCI and outcomes at 3 months after aSAH treatment.
   RESULTS: We enrolled 252 patients with aSAH in our study. Of the 252 patients, 53 experienced DCI and 57 patients had a poor outcome. Patients with unfavorable outcomes had a lower serum albumin, lymphocyte count, total cholesterol, and PNI but a high CONUT score, Hunt-Hess grade, and aneurysm size (P < 0.05). Both the PNI and CONUT score correlated with the Hunt-Hess grade (r = -0.289 and P < 0.001; r = 0.512 and P < 0.001), modified Rankin scale score at 3 months (r = -0386 and P < 0.001; r = 0.533 and P < 0.001), aneurysm size (r = -0.219 and P < 0.001; r = 0.422 and P < 0.001). Only a CONUT score <4 (odds ratio, 0.241; 95% confidence interval, 0.071-0.842; P = 0.022) independently predicted the functional outcome status but not DCI at 3 months after aSAH. However, PNI was an unrelated factor associated with DCI and the clinical outcome.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results have indicated that the CONUT score might efficiently predict for the clinical outcomes at 3 month after aSAH.

AB BACKGROUND: Optimal management of complex anterior circulation aneurysms is an enigmatic challenge because of frequent involvement of major vessel bifurcation, choroidal vessels, and lenticulostriate/thalamostriate perforators. Cerebral ischemia associated with prolonged clipping time is a major concern pertinent to their surgical management, especially in patients with poor cross-flow. To circumvent this hurdle, single/double-barrel low-flow superficial temporal artery (STA) to middle cerebral artery (M3/M4-MCA) can be performed, which can maintain distal cerebral perfusion while facilitating safe clip reconstruction of complex MCA and supraclinoidal internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysms involving ICA bifurcation or supraclinoidal ICA aneurysms with poor cross-circulation-insurance bypass, as well as supplement/alter blood flow after MCA aneurysm trapping-flow-alteration bypass.
   METHODS: A retrospective chart review of consecutive neurosurgical patients operated over 2 years at this center was performed. Patients with complex MCA and ICA aneurysms who were treated with STA-MCA bypass were included. The clinical profile, pre- and postoperative images, intraoperative imaging, and patient outcomes were recorded. Surgical reconstruction of aneurysm was the treatment of choice due to involvement of choroidal/thalamostriate perforators, MCA/ICA bifurcation, complex aneurysm morphology, or dissecting/thrombosed nature of aneurysm. STA-MCA low-flow bypass was performed using M3/M4 segment of MCA as the recipient in anticipation of prolonged temporary clipping time on M1-MCA, supraclinoidal ICA aneurysms with suspected ICA terminus involvement, or need for possible trapping of fusiform MCA aneurysm. The saccular/fusiform part of aneurysm was clip reconstructed and the partially thrombosed dissecting segment was opened for thrombectomy and trapped using proximal and distal clips after good patency of bypass was confirmed. The distal MCA flow was restored adequately and confirmed intraoperatively using indocyanine green angiography and micro-Doppler ultrasonography.
   RESULTS: MCA (n = 4) and supraclinoid-ICA (n = 1) aneurysms were managed successfully using this strategy, which involved 6 STA-MCA bypass procedures (insurance and flow-alteration bypass, 3 each). Postoperative check angiograms demonstrated patent bypass in all 5 patients. Four patients had favorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale score 0/1); one had recovering hemiparesis and aphasia (modified Rankin Scale score 4).
   CONCLUSIONS: This series highlights the surgical strategy and safety for successfully managing complex MCA and ICA aneurysms using low-flow STA-MCA revascularization procedures.

ID COMPLICATIONS FOLLOWING CRANIOPLASTY; FLAP FIXATION TECHNIQUES; GRAFT
   INFECTION; EXPERIENCE; BONE
AB OBJECTIVE: Various complications that can occur during and after cranial surgery have been investigated extensively. One of the less frequent complications has thus far received little attention, however: displacement of the skull implant after craniotomy or craniectomy. The purpose of this study is to identify prognostic factors for the development of skull implant displacement (SID).
   METHODS: In this study, 9087 cranial surgeries performed between 2002 and 2017 were retrospectively examined for the occurrence of SID. Because a first analysis of the investigated data revealed that a notable number of SIDs occurred after a cranioplasty (CP) performed after a decompressive craniectomy (DC), we focused our investigation on these cases. A total of 669 DCs and 329 subsequently performed CPs were analyzed. Several factors were analyzed unadjusted as possible factors influencing the risk for the development of SID.
   RESULTS: A total of 13 implant dislocations occurred after CP (3.95%). Fixation technique is the only factor that seems to have had a significant influence, specifically not using miniplates as the fixation technique, which was associated with a higher risk of SID (P = 0.043). However, if fixation techniques are distinguished in more detail, no significant advantage of the miniplates over titanium clamps can be proven (P = 0.123). None of the remaining observed factors showed a statistically provable impact in our data.
   CONCLUSIONS: A notable number of SIDs only occur after CPs that follow a DC. An advantage in successful placement was observed when fixation of the skull implant during cranioplasty was performed using miniplates.

DE Cost-effectiveness; Health care costs; Value-driven outcome
ID HEALTH-CARE COSTS; SURGICAL-TREATMENT; UNITED-STATES
AB BACKGROUND: Health care costs comprise a substantial portion of total national expenditure. Although interest in cost-effectiveness analysis in neurosurgery has increased, there has been little cross-comparison of neurosurgical procedures. The aim of this study was to compare costs across elective neurosurgical procedures to understand whether drivers of cost differ.
   METHODS: The Value Driven Outcomes database was used to evaluate treatment costs for resection of vestibular schwannoma, intracranial meningioma, gliomas, and pituitary adenoma; anterior cervical discectomy and fusion and lumbar spinal fusion; and aneurysm treatment.
   RESULTS: A total of 1997 patients (mean age 54.6 +/- 14.5 years; 45.2% male) were evaluated. The mean length of stay (LOS) was 4.0 +/- 4.4 days. For cases involving hardware implantation, including spine fusion or aneurysm treatment, supplies and implants (49.1%) accounted for the largest fraction of costs followed by facility costs (37.9%). For cases that did not involve hardware, including tumor cases, facility costs (63.9%) were the largest fraction, followed by supplies and implants (16.2%). Aneurysm treatment and lumbar fusion were 1.5-3 times more costly than cranial tumor resection and anterior cervical discectomy and fusion per patient. Multivariate linear regression demonstrated that LOS (beta = 0.7, P = 0.0001) and patient treatment type (beta = 0.2, P = 0.0001) had the greatest effect on costs. LOS correlated with cost differently depending on case type; its effect was largest for patients with meningioma and smallest for patients with vestibular schwannoma. Costs across time increased similarly for all case types.
   CONCLUSIONS: Costs for neurosurgical procedures vary widely depending on treatment type and correlated directly with LOS. Strategies to reduce cost may require different approaches depending on procedure type.

AB BACKGROUND: Shorter hospital stays have been associated with decreased complication rates, fewer hospital-acquired infections, and lower costs. We evaluated an optimized treatment paradigm for patients undergoing craniotomy allowing for postoperative day 1 (POD1) discharge if the criteria were met. We compared the complication and readmission rates between the POD1 patients and those with longer stays, and examined the patient and surgical variables for predictors of POD1 discharge.
   METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of craniotomies performed for tumor from 2011 to 2015. Craniotomies for tumors were included, and laser ablations and biopsies were excluded.
   RESULTS: A total 424 of patients were included, 132 (31%) of whom had been discharged on POD1. The mean length of stay was 6 days. The POD1 patients had had significantly better preoperative Karnofsky performance scale scores (P < 0.0001) and modified Rankin scale scores (P < 0.0001). Patient frailty, measured using the modified frailty index, was negatively predictive of POD1 discharge (P = 0.0183). Surgical factors predictive of early discharge were awake surgery (P < 0.0001) and supratentorial location (P < 0.0001). No POD1 patients experienced deep venous thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolus (PE), or urinary tract infections. However, of the patients with a length of stay >1 day, 4.4% and 2.7% developed DVT or PE (P = 0.0119) and urinary tract infections (P = 0.0202), respectively. Multivariate regression identified patient factors (male gender, low preoperative modified Rankin scale score), tumor factors (right-sided, supratentorial, smaller size), lower modified frailty index score, and operative factors (lack of a cerebrospinal fluid drain, awake surgery) as independent predictors of successful early discharge.
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients with good functional status can be safely discharged on POD1 after tumor craniotomy if the appropriate postoperative criteria have been met. Patients with early discharge had lower 30-day readmission and DVT/PE rates, likely owing to better baseline health status.

AB BACKGROUND: Positron emission tomography (PET) is a valuable tool for the characterization of brain tumors in vivo. However, few studies have investigated the correlation between carbon-11-methionine (11C-METH) PET metrics and the clinical, radiological, histological, and molecular features of patients affected by lower grade gliomas (LGGs). The present observational study evaluated the relationships between 11C-METH PET metrics and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings with the histomolecular biomarkers in patients with LGGs who were candidates for surgery.
   METHODS: We enrolled 96 patients with pathologically proven LGG (51 men, 45 women; age 44.1 +/- 13.7 years; 45 with grade II, 51 with grade III), who had been referred from March 2012 to January 2015 for tumor resection and had undergone preoperative 11C-METH PET. The semiquantitative metrics for 11C-METH PET included maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), SUV ratio to normal brain, and metabolic tumor burden (MTB). The PET semiquantitative metrics were analyzed and compared with the MRI features, histological diagnosis, isocitrate dehydrogenase-1/2 status, and 1p/19q codeletion.
   RESULTS: Histological grade was associated with SUVmax (P = 0.002), SUV ratio (P = 0.011), and MTB (P = 0.001), with grade III lesions showing higher values. Among the nonenhancing lesions on MRI, SUVmax (P = 0.001), SUV ratio (P = 0.003) and MTB (P < 0.001) were significantly different statistically for grade II versus grade III. The MRI lesion volume correlated poorly with MTB (r(2) = 0.13). The SUVmax and SUV ratio were greater (P < 0.05) in isocitrate dehydrogenase-1/2 wild-type lesions, and the SUV ratio was associated with the presence of the 1p19q codeletion.
   CONCLUSIONS: The 11C-METH PET metrics correlated significantly with histological grade and the molecular profile. Semiquantitative PET metrics can improve the preoperative evaluation of LGGs and thus support clinical decision-making.

AB BACKGROUND: Lateral lumbar interbody fusion (LLIF) has steadily increased in popularity. Compared with the traditional transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF), LLIF is thought to allow for greater improvement in lordosis. However, there are limited direct comparison data on the degree of regional and global alignment change after single-level LLIF and TLIF procedures. This study compared the changes in spinal sagittal alignment in patients who underwent either procedure.
   METHODS: A retrospective analysis of patients who underwent LLIF or TLIF for lumbar degenerative disease at a single institution was performed. Twenty patients who underwent single-level LLIF were matched to 20 patients who underwent single-level TLIF by gender and level of interbody fusion. All included patients had preoperative and postoperative standing scoliosis radiographs. Changes in segmental lordosis (SL) at the fused level, lumbar lordosis (LL), sagittal vertical axis, and pelvic incidencee-LL mismatch (PI-LL) were measured. Statistical analysis was performed using paired and unpaired Student's t-tests. Means were reported with standard error.
   RESULTS: Within each group, 2, 4, and 14 patients had cages placed at L2-3, L3-4, and L4-5, respectively. The LLIF group demonstrated significantly increased SL compared with the TLIF group (+/- 4.9 degrees +/- 3.0 vs. +/- 2.6 degrees +/- 1.7, P = 0.01). LL, sagittal vertical axis, and PI-LL changes did not differ significantly between groups.
   CONCLUSIONS: LLIF achieved greater improvements in SL than TLIF. However, regionally and globally, there were no significant differences with either procedure after a single-level intervention. The increased lordosis from LLIF compared with TLIF may be more impactful globally in multilevel fusions.

AB OBJECTIVE: After 10 years of training in their home country, neurosurgeons at Black Lion Specialized Hospital (Addis Ababa, Ethiopia) operated on skull base meningiomas independent of their external teachers. The present study used a retrospective design of an in-hospital series with short-term follow-up.
   METHODS: A total of 100 patients (mean age, 40.2 years; 80% women) had undergone surgery for skull base meningiomas from 2016 to 2017. Their symptoms included headache in 90%, impairment of vision in 47%, gait impairment in 25%, cognitive dysfunction in 29%, and seizures in 18%. Of the 100 tumors, 44% had a diameter >50 mm. Microsurgery was performed using the Hudson drill, Gigli saw, and conventional microsurgical instruments.
   RESULTS: A total of 59 complications in 39 patients occurred. Eleven patients had died within 3 months post-operatively. The cranial infection rate was 14%. The rate of Simpson grade I and II was 63%. We present the 3-12-month outcomes for 84 of the 100 patients. Of the 16 remaining patients, 4 were lost to follow-up (mean, 6.7 months) and 12 had died. Headache was noted in 65 of 74 patients preoperatively and in 20 during follow-up. Overall, 33 patients reported better vision, 48 reported similar vision, and 3 patients reported worse vision. Finally, 20 patients had gait difficulties preoperatively and 9 reported impaired gait during follow-up.
   CONCLUSION: A young faculty of neurosurgeons in a low income country was trained to perform neurosurgery for skull base meningiomas. The patients had presented at a young age with severe disabilities due to advanced disease. Surgery led to symptom improvement in a large proportion of patients; however, the complication and mortality rates were high.

   Transverse foramen
AB BACKGROUND: The double transverse foramen (DBLTF) is a cervical spine anatomic variant. Current literature has presented prevalence values of DBLTF in Caucasian Mediterranean subjects that seem to be higher than those observed in other samples of subjects. Therefore we aimed to test if Caucasian Mediterranean subjects present a higher prevalence of the DBLTF than sub-Saharan African subjects.
   METHODS: We analyzed the presence of DBLTF in cervical spines of 100 skeletons from Caucasian Mediterranean subjects and 91 skeletons from sub-Saharan African subjects, resulting in a total of 1337 cervical vertebrae having been studied.
   RESULTS: No DBLTF was found in vertebrae C1, C2, and C3. The pattern of prevalence observed in all samples analyzed indicated the prevalence ranged from exhibiting the most to the least prevalence as C6 > C5 > C7 > C4. The sub-Saharan African subjects presented a significant reduced DBLTF prevalence of 2.2%, 14.3%, 19.8%, and 3.3% in C4 (P = 0.043), C5 (P = 0.004), C6 (P < 0.001), and C7 (P = 0.041), respectively, than that presented by Caucasian Mediterranean subjects (9.0%, 32.0%, 45.0%, 11.0% in C4, C5, C6, and C7, respectively).
   CONCLUSIONS: Our study has revealed that this anatomic variation is more frequently found in Caucasian Mediterranean subjects than in sub-Saharan African subjects.

AB INTRODUCTION: The American College of Surgeons-National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Surgical Risk Calculator is a tool developed to use 21 individual patient characteristics to make predictions for occurrence of 13 general and 2 procedure-specific outcomes. The goal of this study was to evaluate the performance of the Surgical Risk Calculator in predicting outcomes in patients receiving posterior lumbar fusion.
   METHODS: American College of Surgeons-National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Participant Use File for 2015 was queried for patients with age >= 18 years undergoing single-level posterior lumbar fusion (PLF) surgery. Individual patient characteristics were entered into the online risk calculator interface to retrieve the predicted estimated risk for perioperative outcomes and complications. Following this, predictive performance was analyzed by computing Brier score, c-statistic, and sensitivity values for all observed outcomes.
   RESULTS: A total of 2808 patients undergoing single-level PLF were included in the analysis. Overall, a very low incidence of 30-day postoperative complications was observed with the procedure (0.9%-6.3%). Poor predictive performance was found for all outcomes, including read-missions (c-statistic = 0.63; sensitivity = 15.28%; Brier score = 0.048) and returns to operating room (c-statistic = 0.56; sensitivity = 21.05%; Brier score = 0.032). The best performance was observed for venous thromboembolism (c-statistic = 0.66: Brier score = 0.008), although sensitivity was poor (3.85%) on account of low incidence. Predictive performance for length of stay revealed good agreement between observed and predicted values with the exception of prolonged predicted hospital stays (>3.5 days).
   CONCLUSIONS: This study assesses the performance of the risk calculator for a homogenous population of patients undergoing a single-level PLF. Although the calculator did not fare well in predicting most outcomes, results need to be interpreted in the context of the low incidence rate of such outcomes.

AB BACKGROUND: Entrapment neuropathies include a wide field of locations. In most cases, the microsurgical decompression is still the therapy of choice. However, the role of venous stasis and ischemia is still discussed controversially. Here the authors evaluated the visualization of microvessels and the microperfusion at peripheral nerves with a contact endoscope during the surgical decompression for the first time.
   METHODS: Eight patients were subjected to endoscopic or endoscopically assisted peripheral nerve decompression. In 3 patients with nerve tumors, the tumor carrying nerve was inspected endoscopically proximal and distal to the tumor site before and after resection. Microcirculation was assessed by a contact endoscope, allowing a 150-fold magnification, at superficial areas proximal and distal to the compression site. The electronically stored records were analyzed retrospectively using image processing software. Vessel diameter, red blood cell velocity, and blood flow, before and after decompression, were extracted.
   RESULTS: The contact endoscope was easy to handle intraoperatively without problems. All minimally invasive procedures were performed without complications. In the offline computer-assisted analysis, single arterioles and veins were visualized showing decreased red blood cell velocity prior to decompression. After surgical treatment, a statistically significant increase of blood flow was observed.
   CONCLUSIONS: Basically, the application of a contact endoscope for visualization of peripheral nerves' microcirculation is feasible. The observed effect of increased blood flow after decompression should be compared with the clinical outcome in a further prospective randomized study.

ID TECHNICAL ASPECTS; BRAIN-TUMORS; MORBIDITY; SEDATION
AB BACKGROUND: An awake throughout (AT) approach for awake craniotomy is mostly under utilized. The purpose of this study was to review the efficacy of the technique at our tertiary care center. The primary objective was to identify the incidence of perioperative complications. The secondary objective was to review the patients' satisfaction, satisfaction of surgical team, length of stay (LOS) in special care unit (SCU), and overall LOS in the hospital.
   METHODS: The study was a retrospective review of patients data. All patients were treated with the AT technique. This included preoperative assessment, psychologic preparation, and institution of scalp block. The incidence of perioperative complications, including satisfaction of surgical team was noted. The patients' satisfaction and the LOS in SCU and in the hospital was also recorded.
   RESULTS: In total, the data from 55 patients were reviewed. Their mean age was 41 years, and 63% were reported to have seizures at presentation. The AT approach was successful in 100% of cases. The incidence of intraoperative seizures was 7.4%, of vomiting was 5.4%, and of conversion to general anesthesia was 0%. The surgical team was able to perform gross total resection in 53% of patients and rated a satisfaction score of 8 out of 10. Postoperative seizures occurred in 5.4% of patients and vomiting in 3.6%. The mean LOS in SCU was 1.2 days, and the overall hospital LOS was 4 days. The patients remained fully satisfied, as evidenced by a mean satisfaction score of 8.6.
   CONCLUSION: An AT approach might be very useful in resource-limited setups because of the low incidence of complications, the use of resources, and significant surgeon and patient satisfaction.

AB OBJECTIVE: To find risk factors for contralateral hematoma progression (CHP) in bilateral chronic subdural hematomas after initial unilateral evacuation.
   METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 53 patients with bilateral chronic subdural hematomas who underwent unilateral surgical evacuation in our department. Risk factors for CHP were identified by univariate analysis, a P value < 0.05 were entered into multivariate logistic regression model and a predictive receiver operating characteristic curve model.
   RESULTS: The progression rate was 32.08%, the average progression interval was 2.32 months. The progression rate of the homogeneous hypodense group was significantly higher than that of the other density group (P = 0.017). The limited type of contralateral hematoma had a significantly lower progression rate than that of the widespread type (P = 0.001). Both pre- and postoperative volume of contralateral hematoma were significantly more in the CHP group compared with the contralateral hematoma without progression group (P = 0.031 and P = 0.001, respectively). Of the 4 risk factors, only postoperative volume of contralateral hematoma was an independent risk factor in multivariate logistic regression model (P = 0.033; 95% confidence interval, 1.005-1.124). The cut-off values of contralateral hematoma volume before and after operation were 29.27 cm(3) and 37.84 cm(3), respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: Contralateral hematoma volume after operation is an independent risk predictor for CHP after unilateral evacuation. An additional surgery on contralateral hematoma or medical treatment should be taken into consideration if the volume is >37.84 cm(3) in the first cranial computed tomography scan after surgery.

AB OBJECTIVE: Long-term effects of endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal intracapsular debulking and adjuvant somatostatin analogs (SSAs) were evaluated in patients with growth hormone- (GH) secreting pituitary macroadenomas.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 45 patients with acromegalic macroadenoma who underwent endonasal endoscopic transsphenoidal intracapsular debulking and received adjuvant SSAs (octreotide) between 2006 and 2015 who had >1 year of follow-up. To evaluate the predictive factors for 1 year and long-term biochemical outcomes, univariate and multivariate analyses were performed.
   RESULTS: Biochemical remission was achieved in 1 year in 20 of the 45 (44.4%) patients, and in 31 of the 45 patients after long-term adjuvant SSA treatment. Tumor control was achieved in 43 of the 45 (93.3%) patients. The univariate analysis showed age (>= 55 years), tumor size (diameter <= 1.5 cm), premedication GH levels (>= 2.8 ng/mL), premedication insulin-like growth factor 1 levels (<= 2-fold of upper limit of normal range), cavernous sinus invasion (Knops grades 2, 3, and 4), and near-total tumor resection were associated with long-term outcomes. The multivariate analysis showed near-total resection was a significant predictor for long-term outcomes (P = 0.019). There were no new pituitary dysfunctions. The observed complications included one case of cerebrospinal fluid leakage and one case of epistaxis requiring intervention.
   CONCLUSIONS: Intracapsular debulking and adjuvant SSAs are a safe and viable treatment for patients with GH secreting pituitary macroadenoma to achieve biochemical remission and tumor control. Although adjuvant SSA treatment enhances residual tumor control, cavernous sinus invasion impedes the remission of endocrine tumors.

AB OBJECTIVE: Percutaneous endoscopic lumbar discectomy (PELD) is a popular surgical procedure for the treatment of lumbar disc herniation (LDH). However, a small proportion of patients will have poor surgical outcomes. We sought to identify the predictors for poor outcomes after PELD.
   METHODS: A total of 241 patients who had undergone PELD were followed up. Their numerical rating scale (NRS) for pain and Oswestry Disability Index scoreswere analyzed. They were divided by outcome (excellent, good, fair, poor) using the MacNab criteria. Their clinical history, physical examination, imaging, and surgical findings were compared among the groups. Ordinal logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent predictors for poor outcomes.
   RESULTS: The preoperative mean total NRS for back pain, NRS for leg pain, and Oswestry Disability Index scores were 4.3 +/- 2.6, 5.6 +/- 2.5, and 52.1% +/- 23.0%. At 2 years after PELD, the corresponding scores had decreased to 1.2 +/- 1.7, 0.9 +/- 1.5, and 8.4% +/- 11.2% (P < 0.001). The excellent, good, fair, and poor outcome rates were 44.4%, 31.5%, 17.4%, and 6.6%, respectively. Ordinal logistic regression analysis revealed that 2-level PELD (P = 0.001), a history of lumbar fusion (P = 0.007), and Modic changes (P = 0.011) were independent predictors for poor outcomes. Numbness was an independent predictor for excellent outcomes (P = 0.014).
   CONCLUSIONS: PELD appears to be an effective surgery for LDH. Two-level PELD, a history of lumbar fusion, and Modic changes at the same level were independent predictors for poor outcomes after PELD. Patients with LDH with numbness were more likely to have excellent outcomes.

AB BACKGROUND: Advancements in microscopy and more recently in neuroendoscopy have revolutionized the field of neurosurgery. Handheld neurosurgical instruments are integral components of these procedures. However, these instruments have many limitations, such as poor ergonomics, constrained maneuverability, and limited degrees of freedom. A need for developing better instruments is commonly felt by neurosurgeons. Also, the focus of modern neurosurgical training is shifting toward simulation models. The baseline data of surgical instruments play a vital role in the development of virtual and physical simulators. A primary factor impeding development of novel instruments and simulators is lack of a comprehensive surgical instrument database. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a virtual repository of microscopic and neuroendoscopic instruments.
   METHODS: Standard neurosurgical instrument sets were scanned, reverse engineered, and stored in various file formats at the file transfer protocol server. The developed database was validated by 4 groups of experts by creating different neurosurgery applications.
   RESULTS: Four groups of experts used the repository content to create novel ergonomic instrument designs, e-learning material, computer visionebased surgical skills evaluation and virtual reality and validated the contents. The validation results showed that quality of content (75%), usefulness of content (85.6%), and time saving using content (88.1%) received high scores, and the effectiveness of the virtual repository contents was appreciated.
   CONCLUSIONS: The virtual database is an efficient starting aid to foster research collaborations related to neurosurgical instruments and surgical simulation platforms.

AB OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of radiofrequency neurotomy (RN) and endoscopic neurotomy (EN) of lumbar medial branch (MB) for facetogenic chronic low back pain (FCLBP).
   METHODS: Forty patients with FCLBP were included and randomly assigned to the control group and the experimental group. The control group (20 cases) underwent X-rayassisted RN and the experimental group (20 cases) underwent EN of the lumbar MB. The patients' Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) score were evaluated and compared preoperatively, and at 3 weeks, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years postoperatively.
   RESULTS: First, the RN group demonstrated successful treatment results (P < 0.05) at 3 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year after surgery. At 2 years, patients reported no significant effectiveness (P > 0.05). Second, the EN group demonstrated more prolonged successful treatment outcomes compared with the RN group. At 2 years, although the efficacy declined further, the VAS and ODI scores showed significant improvements compared with the preoperative data (P < 0.05). Third, there was no difference in VAS and ODI scores between the 2 groups at 3 weeks after surgery (P > 0.05). At 6 months and later, the EN group demonstrated better outcomes (P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: For FCLBP, EN and X-ray-assisted RN of lumbar MB are both effective treatments. However, endoscopic lumbar MB neurotomy has the better and longer effectiveness.

AB OBJECTIVE: Lumbar interbody spacers are widely used in lumbar spinal fusion. The goal of this study is to analyze the biomechanics of a lumbar interbody spacer (Clydesdale Spinal System, Medtronic Sofamor Danek, Memphis, Tennessee, USA) inserted via oblique lumbar interbody fusion (OLIF) or direct lateral interbody fusion (DLIF) approaches, with and without posterior cortical screw and rod (CSR) or pedicle screw and rod (PSR) instrumentation.
   METHODS: Lumbar human cadaveric specimens (L2-L5) underwent nondestructive flexibility testing in intact and instrumented conditions at L3-L4, including OLIF or DLIF, with and without CSR or PSR.
   RESULTS: OLIF alone significantly reduced range of motion (ROM) in flexion-extension (P = 0.005) but not during lateral bending or axial rotation (P >= 0.63). OLIF alone reduced laxity in the lax zone (LZ) during flexion-extension (P < 0.001) but did not affect the LZ during lateral bending or axial rotation (P >= 0.14). The stiff zone (SZ) was unaffected in all directions (P >= 0.88). OLIF plus posterior instrumentation (cortical, pedicle, or hybrid) reduced the mean ROM in all directions of loading but only significantly so with PSR during lateral bending (P = 0.004), without affecting the compressive stiffness (P > 0.20). The compressive stiffness with the OLIF device without any posterior instrumentation did not differ from that of the intact condition (P = 0.97). In terms of ROM, LZ, or SZ, there were no differences between OLIF and DLIF as standalone devices or OLIF and DLIF with posterior instrumentation (CSR or PSR) (P > 0.5).
   CONCLUSIONS: OLIF alone significantly reduced mobility during flexion-extension while maintaining axial compressive stiffness compared with the intact condition. Adding posterior instrumentation to the interbody spacer increased the construct stability significantly, regardless of cage insertion trajectory or screw type.

AB BACKGROUND: Brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are pathologic tangles of intracerebral vessels. The treatment of AVMs aims to reduce the risk of devastating intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). Hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (HSRT) can be used to treat large lesions and reduce the risk of radiation toxicity to the surrounding structures. We analyzed the data from our institutional experience of the past 15 years in treating large AVMs with both 5- and 6-fraction HSRT and evaluated the pretreatment characteristics that are most predictive of the radiographic response.
   METHODS: We included 37 patients and 42 treatments of intracranial AVMs measuring >3 cm in their largest dimension. Data were collected retrospectively by reviewing the electronic health records. The AVM volume was measured before HSRT and at the most recent follow-up appointment. Symptomatic outcomes, including treatment-related inflammation, were measured and defined categorically.
   RESULTS: Complete obliteration was achieved in 11.9% of the patients. The mean AVM volume had decreased significantly after HSRT (P = 8.7e-8). The percentage of volume reduction differed significantly between patients receiving 30-Gy fractions, (partial derivative V = -48.7%) and those receiving 25-Gy fractions (partial derivative V = -29.1%; P = 0.035). Patients with partial or complete obliteration were more likely to have received a total dose of 30 Gy rather than 25 Gy (P = 0.056) and showed a trend toward being treatment naive (P = 0.053).
   CONCLUSION: HSRT can be used as a method to manage large AVMs, with obliteration in some cases and sufficient volume reduction in most others for adjuvant treatment with other modalities. The 30-Gy total dose was generally superior to 25 Gy in achieving obliteration or volume reduction. Further studies focused on longer follow-up periods are warranted.

AB OBJECTIVE: Variance between providers in neurosurgery can lead to inefficiencies and poor patient outcomes. Evidence-based guidelines (EBGs) have been developed; however, they have not been well implemented into the clinician workflow. Therefore, clinicians have been left to make decisions with incomplete information. Equally underused are the electronic health records (EHRs), which house enormous amounts of health data, but the power of that "big data" has failed to be capitalized on.
   METHODS: Early attempts at EBGs were rigid and nonadaptive; however, with the current advances in data informatics and machine learning algorithms, it is now possible to integrate "big data" and rapid data processing into clinical decision support tools. We have presented an overview of the background of EHRs and EBGs in neurosurgery and explored the possibility of integrating them to reduce unwanted variance.
   RESULTS: As we strive toward variance reduction in healthcare, the integration of "big data" and EBGs for decision-making will be key. We have proposed that EHRs are an ideal platform for integrating EBGs into the clinician workflow and have presented as an example of a successful early generation model, Neurocore. With this approach, it will be possible to build EBGs into the EHR software, to continuously update and optimize EBGs according to the flow of patient data into the EHR, and to present data-driven clinical decision support at the point of care.
   CONCLUSIONS: Variance reduction in neurosurgery through the integration of evidence-based decision support in EHRs will lead to improved patient safety, a reduction in medical errors, maximization of the use of the available data, and enhanced decision-making power for clinicians.

AB BACKGROUND: Ependymoma is the most frequent spinal tumor in adults but it is rather uncommon in children. The aim of the present study was to retrospectively summarize the clinical and therapeutic experience in the treatment of pediatric spinal ependymomas in France.
   METHODS: In the present retrospective multicenter study, data from patients aged <18 years who had been treated from 2000 to 2010 for spinal ependymomas were collected. Epidemiologic and tumor- and treatment-related data were analyzed. The prognostic factors for progression-free survival (PFS) were assessed.
   RESULTS: We identified 28 patients (22 males, 6 females). Their median age at surgery was 13.67 years (range, 0.7-17.6). Initial gross total resection (GTR) was achieved in 22 children and subtotal resection (STR) in 6. Histologically, 15 tumors were myxopapillary ependymomas and 11 were grade II and 2 grade III ependymomas. Adjuvant initial radiotherapy (RT) was performed in 6 patients. The median follow-up period was of 40 months (range, 2.3-127.5). The 5-year PFS rate was 51% (95% confidence interval, 26.3%-71.2%), and the overall survival rate was 100%. On univariate analysis, only GTR had a significant influence on PFS (P = 0.0013). A subgroup analysis showed a benefit of RT delivered to patients with GTR; however, RT failed to prevent relapse in the group with initial STR.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that initial adjuvant RT might improve PFS after GTR but will not prevent relapse in patients with STR. Further studies are needed to define more specific treatments for the latter group.

ID PERONEAL NERVE
AB OBJECTIVE: Compression of the common fibular nerve at the level of the fibular neck is considered to be the most frequent lower limb entrapment syndrome, which can be either idiopathic or secondary. Decompressive surgery is indicated only after failure of conservative treatment and/or severe neurologic deficit. The effectiveness of micro-surgical decompression has been established only for secondary entrapment syndrome. The aim of this study is to assess the results of microsurgical decompression and establish the prognosis of idiopathic severe common fibular nerve entrapment.
   METHODS: Fifteen patients were included in this prospective clinical study and were followed at day 1 after surgery and later at 1, 6, and 12 months. More than half (64.3%) of patients had a total motor deficit (0/5). The median motor function preoperatively was 0/5. The average time of conservative treatment before surgery was 25.7 days (range 5-110 days). One patient refused surgical management.
   RESULTS: Thirteen out of 14 patients who underwent surgery showed significant motor function improvement. The median motor strength at 12 months was 4.5/5. Half of the patients regained normal motor function. The only patient who did not improve had the longest time to surgery interval (110 days). The patient who refused surgery showed no improvement (0/5 at 12 months).
   CONCLUSIONS: Microsurgical decompression should be considered early in the context of severe idiopathic common fibular nerve entrapment in order to get a favorable outcome.

ID INTRACRANIAL ANEURYSMS; ENDOVASCULAR TREATMENT; EMBOLIZATION
AB BACKGROUND: Stent-assisted coiling is recognized as effective to induce progressive occlusion and prevent recurrence of aneurysm. The long-term effects of stent-assisted coiling of sidewall-type and terminal-type aneurysms were comparatively analyzed focusing on the different hemodynamic characteristics.
   METHODS: Retrospective analysis included a total of 120 unruptured aneurysms in 116 consecutive patients who underwent stent-assisted coiling and completed 2-year follow-up. The stent systems, baseline characteristics, and postcoiling occlusion status of sidewall-type and terminal-type aneurysms were assessed.
   RESULTS: Sidewall-type aneurysms had a significantly larger dome size (P = 0.02) and greater diameter of the parent vessel (P < 0.001) than terminal-type aneurysms. Initial occlusion status of the aneurysms was significantly maintained for 2 years in both sidewall-type and terminal-type aneurysms as follows: sidewall-type aneurysms showed that complete occlusion (CO), neck remnants (NRs), and body filling (BF) immediately posttreatment were significantly correlated with CO (P < 0.05), NRs (P < 0.01), and BF (P < 0.05) at 2-year follow-up, respectively, and terminal-type aneurysms showed that CO, NRs, and BF immediately posttreatment were significantly correlated with CO (P < 0.05), NRs (P < 0.05), and BF (P < 0.05) at 2-year follow-up, respectively. In addition, sidewall-type aneurysms with CO immediately posttreatment were significantly correlated with non-NRs (P < 0.01) and non-BF (P < 0.01) at 2-year follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: Stent-assisted coiling allows higher coil packing for sidewall-type aneurysms, but the indication should be carefully considered for terminal-type aneurysms.

ID BRACHIAL-PLEXUS PALSY; RECONSTRUCTION; RESTORATION; OUTCOMES; INJURY
AB BACKGROUND: The restoration of shoulder function after brachial plexus injury is a high priority. Shoulder abduction and stabilization can be achieved by nerve transfer procedures including spinal accessory nerve (SAN) to suprascapular nerve (SSN) and radial to axillary nerve transfer. The objective of this study is to compare functional outcomes after SAN to SSN transfer versus the combined radial to axillary and SA to SSN transfer.
   METHODS: This retrospective chart review included 14 consecutive patients with brachial plexus injury who underwent SAN to SSN transfer, 4 of whom had both SA to SSN and radial to axillary nerve transfer.
   RESULTS: SAN to SSN transfer achieved successful shoulder abduction (>= M3) in 64.3% of this cohort (9/14). During the long-term follow-up, patients achieved an average increase of 67.5 degrees in shoulder abduction. There was no association between motor recovery and time from injury to surgery, age, body mass index (BMI), sex, or smoking status. The 4 patients who had SAN to SSN combined with radial to axillary nerve transfer demonstrated a statistically significant increase in the range of abduction (median, 90 degrees vs. 42.5 degrees, respectively; P = 0.022) compared with those who had SAN to SSN transfer alone; however, the difference in Medical Research Council (MRC) grades (MRC > M3) did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.07).
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients with brachial plexus injury and an intact C7 root could benefit from radial to axillary transfer in addition to SAN to SSN transfer. There was no association between recovery of shoulder abduction and time interval from injury to surgery, age, sex, smoking, and BMI.

ID PERIOPERATIVE COMPLICATIONS; OUTCOMES; IMPACT
AB BACKGROUND: Spinal deformity surgery is often invasive and lengthy. Staging surgery over separate operative days may reduce complications. Staging is often used in minimally invasive treatment of adult spinal deformity (ASD).
   OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of staging on complication rates between hybrid (HYB; minimally invasive interbody with open posterior screw and rod fixation) and circumferential minimally invasive surgery (cMIS; minimally invasive interbody and screw/rod placement) procedures in patients with ASD.
   METHODS: A multicenter database of patients with ASD was reviewed. Patients who underwent staging (at least 3 levels) and 2 years of follow-up were analyzed. A total of 99 patients underwent staging: 53 cMIS and 46 HYB surgeries. Propensity matching for levels fused resulted in 19 patients in each group. Intra-and perioperative complications were assessed.
   RESULTS: Three HYB but no cMIS intraoperative complications occurred. More HYB patients had perioperative complications than cMIS patients. Neurologic complications were more frequent in HYB versus cMIS. Other complications did not differ significantly. Thirty-day reoperations were higher with cMIS than HYB, but there was no difference in reoperation rate at long-term follow-up. cMIS patients had greater improvement in the Oswestry Disability Index. There was no difference in complications between staged versus unstaged cMIS surgeries.
   CONCLUSIONS: cMIS staged surgeries appear safer than HYB staged surgeries, and equally safe to cMIS unstaged surgeries. Perioperative complications were significantly higher for HYB staged surgeries. HYB surgeries may have better results when performed in a single setting, whereas cMIS surgeries can be performed in 1 or 2 stages depending on surgeon preference.

AB OBJECTIVE: Although several prognostic factors for traumatic brain injury (TBI) have been evaluated, a useful predictive scoring model for the outcomes has not been developed for patients with severe TBI who undergo decompressive craniectomy (DC). The aim of the present study was to determine independent predictors and develop a multivariate logistic regression equation to predict the early outcome and discharge status for patients with severe TBI who have undergone DC.
   METHODS: A total of 13 different variables were evaluated. The data from all 278 patients with severe TBI who had undergone DC in the present study were retrospectively evaluated from July 2011 to June 2017. Using univariate, multiple logistic regression and prognostic regression scoring equations it was possible to draw receiver operating characteristic curves to predict the early outcomes and discharge status after TBI.
   RESULTS: We found that younger age (P = 0.012), no significant medical history (P = 0.044), diameter of both pupils < 4 mm (P = 0.032), higher admission Glasgow coma scale score (P = 0.004), no tracheotomy (P < 0.001), and DC for severe TBI were associated with a favorable early outcome and discharge status. Using receiver operating characteristic curves to predict the probability of a favorable outcome, the sensitivity was 80.0% and the specificity was 79.5%.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary findings have shown that 5 variables can be used as independent predictors in assessing the early outcome and discharge status for patients with severe TBI after DC.

DE Anatomy; Carotid stenosis; Revascularization stroke; Surgical procedure;
   Surgical result
ID LATERAL POSITION; RISK-FACTOR; ARTERY
AB BACKGROUND: The internal carotid artery is normally positioned posterolateral to the external carotid artery at the carotid bifurcation. An anatomic variation with the internal carotid artery positioned medial to the external carotid artery, the so-called twisted carotid bifurcation (TCB), is sometimes encountered in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Little is known about the TCB or the implications for CEA.
   OBJECTIVE: The present study investigated the demographics and surgical results of our patients with TCB who underwent CEA, and demonstrates the surgery in a video clip.
   METHODS: Eleven of our series of 73 consecutive CEA patients (15.1%) had a TCB (TCB group). The basic surgical method was the same for both the TCB and non-TCB groups.
   RESULTS: The patient demographics were almost identical between the 2 groups. No significant difference was observed in the degree of stenosis, the duration of operation, or the surgery-related complications between the 2 groups. However, 9 of 11 cases were right-sided in the TCB group; the only significant difference between the groups.
   CONCLUSIONS: CEA for TCB can be safely performed by extension of the normal procedure, but with more meticulous preoperative assessment and gentle maneuvers. The reason for the right-side dominance is still unknown. Further investigation is needed of this anatomic entity.

AB BACKGROUND: Augmented reality (AR) is gaining popularity in gaming, industrial, military, and medical fields. Neurosurgical applications are currently limited and underdeveloped.
   METHODS: The cadaver lab session was prepared with the currently available AR equipment and software. Pedicle instrumentation was performed from thoracic 1 to the pelvis with either fluoroscopy or AR.
   RESULTS: A total of 38 screws were placed. There were no major breaches on the fluoroscopy-assisted side. Among the AR screws, 3 had a major medial breach and 4 had a major inferior breach. The cause of a 3 breaches appeared to be related to an error in the starting position, as their overall orientation remained correctly parallel to the original trajectory.
   CONCLUSIONS: The article discusses the potential and limitations of AR in its current state and identifies strategies for successful AR application in future surgery.

TI Implications of Extracranial Distortion in Ultra-High-Field Magnetic
   Resonance Imaging for Image-Guided Cranial Neurosurgery

   Neuronavigation; Ultra-high-field MRI
ID GEOMETRIC DISTORTION; BRAIN; MRI; SURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: Ultra-high-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain is attractive for image guidance during neurosurgery because of its high tissue contrast and detailed vessel visualization. However, high-field MRI is prone to distortion artifacts, which may compromise image guidance. Here we investigate intra-and extracranial distortions in 7-T MRI scans.
   METHODS: Five patients with and 5 patients without skin-adhesive fiducials received magnetization-prepared T1-weighted 7-T MRI and standard 3-T MRI scans. The 7- and 3-T images were rigidly coregistered and compared. Intracranial distortions were evaluated qualitatively, whereas shifts at the skin surface and shifts of the center positions of skin-adhesive fiducials were measured quantitatively. Moreover, we present an illustrative case of an ultra-highfield image-guided skull base meningioma resection.
   RESULTS: We found excellent intracranial correspondence between 3- and 7-T MRI scans. However, the average maximum skin shift was 6.8 +/- 2.0 mm in group A and 5.2 +/- 0.9 mm in group B. The average maximum difference between the skin-adhesive fiducial positions was 5.6 +/- 3.1 mm in group B. In our tumor resection case, the meningioma blood supply could be targeted early thanks to 7-T image guidance, which made subsequent tumor removal straightforward.
   CONCLUSIONS: There are no visible intracranial distortions in magnetization-prepared T1-weighted 7-T MRI cranial images. However, we found considerable extracranial shifts. These shifts render 7-T images unreliable for patient-to-image registration. We recommend performing patient-to-image registration on a routine (computed tomography scan or 3-T magnetic resonance) image and subsequently fusing the 7-T magnetic resonance image with the routine image on the image guidance machine, until this issue is resolved.

AB OBJECTIVE: To analyze the biomechanical changes of lumbar adjacent segment by comparing the biomechanics after the surgery of transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) and oblique lumbar interbody fusion (OLIF).
   METHODS: The finite element model of the L1-S1 was reconstructed via computed tomography scan images. The models of TLIF and OLIF were constructed and analyzed. A 400-N vertical axial pre-load was imposed on the superior surface of L1 and a 10-N.m moment was applied on the L1 superior surface along the radial direction to simulate 4 different physiological motions: flexion, extension, bending, and torsion. The range of motion (ROM) and the intradiscal pressure (IDP) were evaluated and compared with investigate the biomechanical influences of TLIF and OLIF on the adjacent segments (L3-L4 and L5-S1).
   RESULTS: Compared with the normal model, TLIF and OLIF in all motion patterns increased the ROM and the IDP of adjacent segments. However, the ROM and the IDP between TLIF and OLIF had no significant difference.
   CONCLUSIONS: The biomechanical analysis showed that both TLIF and OLIF can increase ROM and IDP. It indicates that TLIF and OLIF probably increase the potential risk of adjacent segment degeneration similarly.

AB BACKGROUND: White matter injury (WMI) has been observed after experimental intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). The supporting clinical data have been sparse. We assessed the presence, extent, and progression of WMI in patients with ICH.
   METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of data from 65 consecutive patients with spontaneous supratentorial ICH who had undergone baseline brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within 7 days of ICH onset and repeat MRI afterward. We used the Fazekas scale (FZKS) to grade the severity of WMI. The clinical and imaging characteristics of the patients with and without WMI progression (WMIP) were compared using uni- and multi-variate logistic regression analyses.
   RESULTS: We observed WMIP in 23 patients (35.4%). WMIP was noted in both hemispheres but more commonly ipsilateral to the ICH (33% vs. 21%). The mean total FZKS score had increased from 3 (interquartile range [IQR], 1-4) at baseline to 4 (IQR, 2-5) on repeat MRI (P < 0.0001). Patients with lobar ICH had a greater median FZKS score than those with deep ICH (median, 3; IQR, 2-4; vs. 1.5, IQR, 1-3.25; P = 0.027). The baseline parenchymal ICH volume (odds ratio [OR], 1.067; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.018-1.119; P = 0.007) and ventricular volume on baseline MRI (OR, 1.073; 95% CI, 1.019-1.130; P = 0.007) were predictors of WMIP after adjustment. Multivariate analyses showed an independent association between WMIP and unfavorable 3-month outcomes (OR, 5.196; 95% CI, 1.059-25.483; P = 0.042).
   CONCLUSIONS: WMI will progress over time in patients with ICH, and WMIP has been associated with worse outcomes. This novel finding could represent a potential therapeutic target. Future prospective larger studies are needed to confirm our findings.

ID METHYLATION; APOPTOSIS; 5-METHYLCYTOSINE; INHIBITION; CONVERSION
AB BACKGROUND: Spinal cord and neuron injury result in loss of muscle function, sensation, or autonomic function in the body. Tet1 produces 5-hydroxymethylcytosin. The conversion was proposed as the initial step of deoxyribonucleic acid demethylation in mammals. However, effects of Tet1 expression and hydroxymethylation status on neuron injury remain unclear. Therefore the current study was designed to explore effects of Tet1 expression and hydroxymethylation status on cell survival and gene expression after neuron injury.
   METHODS: Mouse models of spinal cord injury and cell model of neuron injury were created. Animals were sacrificed, and injured spinal cord tissue was harvested. Neuron-like cells were cultured after scratch injury. Hydroxymethylated deoxyribonucleic acid concentration was detected, and Tet1 expression was examined by qPCR. Neuron-like cells were divided into 3 groups: control, injury, and azacytidine + injury (before injury, cells were pretreated with azacytidine) groups. Culture supernatant was collected, and lactate dehydrogenase concentration was detected. Meanwhile, injured neuron-like cells were divided into 3 groups: negative control, Tet1 overexpression, and Tet1 interference. Relative expression of Tet1, BDNF, NTF3, A20, FLIP, HSP70, HSP90, HSP27, and Bcl2 in neuron-like cells was detected by qPCR. In addition, neuron-like cells were divided into 7 groups.
   RESULTS: Tet1 expression and deoxyribonucleic acid hydroxymethylation increased initially and decreased thereafter after neuron injury in both animal and cell models. Percentages of dead cells increased significantly in neuron-like cells after injury. The percentages of dead cells markedly decreased in injured neuron-like cells that were pretreated with azacytidine. The percentages of dead cells increased markedly in the Tet1 interference group and decreased significantly in the Tet1 overexpression group. Expression of Tet1, BDNF, A20, FLIP, HSP70, HSP90, and Bcl2 decreased significantly after injury. Azacytidine pretreatment in injured neuron-like cells markedly increased expression of Tet1, BDNF, NTF3, A20, FLIP, HSP70, HSP90, HSP27, and Bcl2. Moreover, Tet1 interference significantly decreased the expression of Tet1, BDNF, A20, FLIP, HSP70, and HSP90 in neuron-like cells, whereas Tet1 overexpression markedly increased the expression of Tet1, BDNF, NTF3, A20, FLIP, HSP70, HSP90, HSP27, and Bcl2. BDNF interference significantly increased percentages of dead cells after injury. BDNF interference also markedly decreased the protection of azacytidine and Tet1 overexpression against cell death.
   CONCLUSIONS: Tet1 overexpression and demethylation caused by azacytidine protect neurons against cell death after injury by increasing expression of genes involved in cell survival.

AB BACKGROUND: Pituitary adenomas in elderly patients may become more common as the population ages. Surgical benefits, especially for visual outcome, after endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal surgery for pituitary adenomas remain to be elucidated. This retrospective analysis investigated clinical factors affecting visual outcome.
   METHODS: The study included 35 patients with nonfunctional pituitary adenomas who underwent surgery and were subdivided into elderly (>= 70 years old, n = 12) and younger (<70 years old, n = 23) groups for analysis. Clinical characteristics and preoperative and postoperative visual function evaluated using visual impairment score (VIS) were compared between groups.
   RESULTS: Mean age at diagnosis was 75.1 +/- 1.5 years in the elderly group and 55.5 +/- 2.0 years in the younger group. VIS was improved in 91% of elderly patients and 80% of younger patients, but postoperative VIS remained higher in elderly patients. Preoperative VIS and incidence of previous cataract surgery were significantly higher in elderly patients than in younger patients. Preoperative and postoperative VISs were significantly correlated with age. Preoperative VIS was significantly higher in patients with previous cataract surgery and correlated with postoperative VIS.
   CONCLUSIONS: Visual disturbances were improved postoperatively in most patients in both groups at similar rates, but preoperative and postoperative visual disturbances were more severe in elderly patients because the symptoms may have been masked by the presence of lens opacity. Early diagnosis and intervention may be required in elderly patients for better visual outcome.

AB OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical and radiologic outcomes of 3 anterior surgical techniques for the treatment of 3-level cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) and the evolution of intramedullary T2-weighted increased signal intensity (ISI).
   METHODS: A total of 98 consecutive patients (61 males, 37 females) with 3-level CSM who underwent anterior cervical surgery between January 2006 and January 2016 were retrospectively enrolled. Based on different anterior reconstructive techniques, the patients were divided into 3 groups: anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF), anterior cervical corpectomy and fusion (ACCF), and hybrid decompression and fusion (HDF) groups. The Japanese Orthopaedic Association score and its recovery rate were used to evaluate the clinical outcomes. The cervical alignment and range of motion were used to assess radiologic outcomes. In addition, the signal change ratio and length of ISI were used to measure the ISI.
   RESULTS: No statistical differences in preoperative factors were found among the 3 groups (P > 0.05). Although the HDF group had intermediate surgery time and blood loss compared with other groups (P < 0.05), it achieved greater postoperative Japanese Orthopaedic Association score and recovery rate than other groups (P < 0.05). The postoperative C2-C7 lordotic angle and postoperative range of motion in the HDF group were similar to that in the ACDF group (P > 0.05), both greater than that in the ACCF group (P < 0.05). The incidence of complications in the HDF group was close to the ACDF group (P > 0.05), and both groups were lower than that in the ACCF group (P < 0.05). In addition, the postoperative signal change ratio in the HDF group was lower than in other groups (P < 0.05). The postoperative length of ISI in the HDF group was similar to the ACCF group (P > 0.05), which was both shorter than that in the ACDF group (P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: For patients with 3-level CSM with ISI on T2-weighted MRI, HDF can be considered as the optimal technique that achieves better clinical and radiologic outcomes than the ACDF or ACCF procedure. HDF also has a better postoperative regression of ISI compared with the ACDF or ACCF procedure, which may potentially be an important indicator for improving surgical outcomes.

TI Radiologic Features of Primary Intracranial Myxomas from the Skull Base:
   14 Case Reports and Literature Review
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Review
DE Computed tomography; Magnetic resonance imaging; Myxomas; Skull base
AB BACKGROUND: Primary intracranial myxomas (PIMs) are extremely rare benign tumors that arise from the skull base. The aim of this study was to characterize the radiologic manifestation of PIMs in a series of 14 cases.
   METHODS: We reviewed the imaging and clinical data of 14 patients with pathologically proven PIMs. Assessed features of lesions include shape, margin, bony destruction, attenuation and/or signal intensity, and pattern of enhancement.
   RESULTS: Extremely high-density foci indicating calcification or bony debris within the tumors were observed in 5 cases on computed tomography images. On magnetic resonance images, the tumors demonstrated heterogeneous hypointensity on T1-weighted images (T1WI) and hyperintensity on T2-weighted images (T2WI). A honeycomb pattern on enhanced T1WIs was observed in 63.6% (7/11) of the cases.
   CONCLUSIONS: Radiologic findings of PIMs include calcified foci or bone debris on computed tomography, heterogeneous hypointensity on T1WI and predominantly hyperintensity on T2WI, and honeycomb appearance on enhanced T1WI.

SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article

   Vascular anatomy
ID PREOPERATIVE EMBOLIZATION; CORD COMPRESSION; CANCER; BREAST
AB BACKGROUND: Preoperative endovascular embolization of hypervascular metastatic spine tumors can reduce intraoperative blood loss. One frequent objection to embolizing these tumors is the concern for associated arteries feeding the spinal cord, such as the artery of Adamkiewicz. This study aimed to elucidate a relationship between spinal levels affected by hypervascular spine metastases and associated radiculomedullary arteries (RMAs).
   METHODS: A retrospective review of 46 patients who underwent preoperative embolization of hypervascular metastatic spine tumors was conducted. A total of 484 spinal levels were evaluated by diagnostic spinal angiography during embolization procedures. Each spinal level was categorized based on the presence or absence of tumor and RMA.
   RESULTS: No statistically significant associations were found. The relative risk of affected spinal levels having an associated RMA was 1.10 (95% confidence interval, 0.66-1.85). The attributable risk was 0.01 (-0.01 to 0.02). Chi-squared statistic was 0.13, with a P value of 0.7. Sub-group analysis in renal cell patients was also statistically insignificant, with a relative risk of 0.97 (95% confidence interval, 0.43-2.16). Chi-square statistic was 0.01, with a P value 0.94. A total of 32 patients (69.6%) had an RMA identified on their regional angiogram. Seventeen patients (37%) had an RMA at an embolized level.
   CONCLUSIONS: In this study, no association was found between spinal levels affected by hypervascular metastatic spine tumors and RMAs feeding the spinal cord by diagnostic spinal angiography. This suggests that these tumors have little intrinsic affinity for spinal levels with an RMA. However, given that tumor embolization frequently requires accessing multiple levels, the risk of encountering an RMA during embolization remains significant.

ID STEREOTACTIC RADIOSURGERY; METASTASIS; DIFFERENTIATION; GLIOBLASTOMAS;
   MANAGEMENT
AB BACKGROUND: Solitary brain tumors can propose a diagnostic dilemma owing to the difficulty in differentiating between primary brain tumors and metastatic disease. The similar radiologic appearance on routine magnetic resonance imaging will necessitate the need for additional noninvasive testing. We sought to determine the clinical utility of preoperative whole body screening with computed tomography (CT) to detect metastatic disease in patients with solitary brain tumors.
   METHODS: A prospectively maintained surgical database for a large quaternary care academic institution was retrospectively reviewed for all patients undergoing craniotomy for a new diagnosis of enhancing solitary brain lesion from January 2011 to January 2016. Patients were excluded if the imaging findings had demonstrated multiple brain tumors, they had a known diagnosis of malignancy, or they had undergone previous craniotomy. The demographic and radiographic information and clinical and histopathologic data were collected and tallied.
   RESULTS: A total of 218 patients with solitary brain tumors met the inclusion criteria and were included in the present study. Histopathologic analysis confirmed primary central nervous system tumors in 152 patients (74.4%) and metastatic disease in 66 (25.6%). Preoperative screening with whole body CT had a sensitivity of 0.92 and specificity of 0.95 for detecting systemic metastases in the patients. Preoperative whole body CT correctly identified systemic malignancy in 88% of the patients ultimately diagnosed with metastasis (positive predictive value, 88%). Of those with negative whole body imaging findings, 97% had a diagnosis of a primary central nervous system neoplasm (negative predictive value, 97%).
   CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative whole body CT had a positive predictive value of 88% and negative predictive value of 97% in the present study and was both sensitive (92%) and specific (95%) for the detection of extracranial tumors. The identification of extracranial tumors on whole body CT screening might alter management.

AB OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of chronic preoperative steroid therapy on 30-day perioperative complications after anterior lumbar fusion (ALF).
   METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program between 2008 and 2015. Adult patients who underwent ALF were included and divided into 2 groups: steroids and no steroids. We compared baseline patient demographics, comorbidities, and operative variables between these 2 groups and then performed a multivariate regression analysis to determine complications that were independently associated with chronic steroid therapy. We also performed a subgroup analysis of the steroid group to identify additional risk factors that further predispose these patients to postoperative complications.
   RESULTS: A total of 9483 patients were included, of whom 289 (3.0%) were on chronic steroid therapy. Univariate analysis showed that chronic steroid use was independently associated with 4 perioperative complications, including deep surgical site infection (odds ratio [OR], 2.78; confidence interval [CI], 1.09-7.10; P = 0.033), pulmonary complications (OR, 1.98; CI, 1.02-3.86; P = 0.044), blood transfusion (OR, 1.60; CI, 1.15-2.23; P = 0.005), and extended length of stay (OR, 1.58; CI, 1.17-2.16; P = 0.003). In patients on chronic steroid therapy, pulmonary comorbidity and extended operative time were additional risk factors that further predisposed to perioperative complications, including deep surgical site infection, blood transfusion, and extended length of stay.
   CONCLUSIONS: Chronic preoperative steroid therapy is associated with perioperative complications after ALF. Decisions about the discontinuing or holding steroid therapy preoperatively should be determined through an interdisciplinary approach between the medical and surgical teams.

ID SURGICAL SITE INFECTION; WOUND-INFECTION; FUSION; DISEASE
AB BACKGROUND: Spine surgeries performed via the posterior approach have a higher infection rate. Several theories have been proposed, including poor hygienic condition of bed sheets and traumatized muscle associated with supine position promoting circulatory impairment. We investigated the influence of supine position on the rate of deep wound infection after spine surgery by the posterior approach.
   METHODS: A total of 106 patients were randomly divided into 2 groups: lateral decubitus only versus dorsal and lateral decubitus. Patient follow-up after hospital discharge was performed at 30, 60, 180, and 360 days. Deep wound infection was diagnosed according to U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria.
   RESULTS: Patient sample was mainly composed of patients with neoplastic disease and patients with trauma. Postoperative wound infection developed in 12 cases (11.3%), and Streptococcus aureus was the most common pathogen. Incidence of postsurgical deep wound infection was significantly greater in the control group (P = 0.004).
   CONCLUSIONS: Supine position was significantly correlated with higher rates of wound infection among patients who underwent spine surgery by the posterior approach. Avoidance of supine position may represent a modifiable risk factor to diminish postoperative spine infection rates.

AB OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the clinical efficacy of the Biocage in lumbar fusion surgery and its safety and effectiveness.
   METHODS: A total of 431 patients with single-segment lumbar degenerative disease diagnosed from January 2013 to December 2016 were considered for the present prospective, nonrandomized, and controlled study; 52 patient met the exclusion criteria and were excluded. The patients were divided into 2 groups according to their cage choice: Biocage (n = 206) and polyether ether ketone (PEEK) cage (n = 173). The patients were followed up for 24-48 months (average, 32). The operative time, blood loss, hospitalization duration, mean intervertebral fusion segment height, height of intervertebral foramen, fusion time, fusion rate, internal fixation failure rate, visual analog scale score, and Oswestry disability index were compared between the 2 groups.
   RESULTS: All the patients underwent surgery successfully. No significant differences were found in gender, age, clinical diagnosis, lesion segment, operative time, blood loss, visual analog scale score, or Oswestry disability index between the 2 groups. No significant differences were found in the fusion rate; however, the Biocage group had a greater fusion rate and shorter fusion time than the PEEK group. During follow-up, the mean intervertebral height recovered significantly in the Biocage group compared with the PPEK group (P < 0.05). The height of the intervertebral foramen was significantly different between the 2 groups, and recovery was better in the Biocage group (P < 0.05). The Cobb angle of fusion segment in both groups improved significantly postoperatively compared with preoperatively (P < 0.05). The improvement in Cobb angle was significantly different between the 2 groups (P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: The Biocage has excellent clinical efficacy in the treatment of lumbar degenerative disease. Although the Biocage achieved good therapeutic effects, it did not show obvious advantages compared with the PEEK cage. Therefore, the Biocage can only be used as a choice of bone graft materials for lumbar fusion surgery and should not completely replace the PEEK cage.

AB OBJECTIVE: Efficacy of minimally invasive craniopuncture with the YL-1 puncture needle (hard-channel) and soft drainage tube (soft-channel) in treating hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage (HICH).
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 150 patients with HICH were randomly assigned into 3 groups: conservative group (n = 50), hard-channel group (n = 50), and soft-channel group (n = 50). Computed tomography, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and the levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and malondialdehyde (MDA) in serum and in drainage fluid were examined on days 2, 4, and 6 after operation.
   RESULTS: Compared with the conservative group, the serum levels of IL-6, TNF-alpha, and MDA were decreased and SOD was increased (P < 0.05); volumes of hematoma and perihematomal edema as well as NIHSS were reduced (P < 0.05) in minimally invasive groups on days 7, 14, and 28 after operation. Compared with the hard-channel group, the serum levels of IL-6, TNF-alpha, MDA, and SOD showed the same trend as above in the soft-channel group. In the soft-channel group, MDA was reduced and SOD was increased in brain drainage fluid on days 2, 4, and 6 (P < 0.05); volumes of hematoma and perihematomal edema on days 14 and 28 were found to be reduced compared with the hard channel group (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference of volumes of hematoma and perihematomal edema on day 7 between minimally invasive groups. NIHSS of the soft-channel group appeared to be significantly reduced on days 7, 14, and 28 after operation (P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: Soft-channel minimally invasive craniopuncture is an ideal technique for treating HICH, with advantages of alleviating cerebral edema, reducing oxidative stress, and inhibiting inflammatory response.

AB OBJECTIVE: In the study, we aimed to identify key microRNAs (miRNAs) and clinical factors associated with survival time of lower-grade glioma (LGG) and develop an expression-based miRNA signature to provide survival risk prediction for patients with LGG.
   METHODS: We obtained miRNA expression profiles and clinical information of patients with LGG from The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset. All 591 miRNAs were modeled using random Forest Survival, Regression, and Classification to construct a random forest model for survival analysis, and feature selection was performed. We used univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis to screen differentially expressed miRNAs and clinical factors related to overall survival of patients with LGG.
   RESULTS: A total of 591 differentially expressed miRNAs were obtained between LGG and normal tissues. After univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis, 2 predictive miRNAs (hsa-miR-10b-5p and hsa-miR-15b-5p) and 3 clinical factors (grade, age, and cancer status) were finally screened out to construct a 5-signature, based on which patients in the training dataset were divided into high-risk and low-risk groups. The competitive performance of the 5-signature was revealed by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. The prognostic value of the 5-signature was successfully validated in the testing and validation dataset.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated the promising potential of the novel 5-signature as an independent biomarker for survival prediction of patients with LGG.

AB OBJECTIVE: To determine the safety and effectiveness of the combined halo gravity traction and dual growing rod technique in achieving and maintaining scoliosis correction while allowing spinal growth.
   METHODS: From January 2014 to July 2017, 11 patients with dystrophic neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)-associated scoliosis, including 7 men and 4 women, underwent combined halo gravity traction and dual growing rod technique procedures. Diagnoses were all dystrophic NF1-associated scoliosis. Patients with a Cobb angle of major curve >60 degrees and flexibility of spine <30% were included in our research. Analysis included age at the time of treatment, levels of instrumentation, number and frequency of lengthening, lengthening distance, and complications. The changes in Cobb angle of scoliosis and T1-S1 length of spine over the treatment period were measured by radiographic evaluation.
   RESULTS: The average age of treated patients was 7.2 years (range, 5-9 years). Growing rods were lengthened every 6 months through exposure. The mean number of times of lengthening was 3.9 (range, 3-5). The distance of each extension was 1.6 cm (range, 1.0-2.0 cm). The Cobb angle was corrected 41.7% on average after traction, 48.4% after initial surgery, and 53.3% at the last follow-up. T1-S1 length increased 3.4 cm (range, 1.2-5.1 cm) on average over a mean treatment period of 2.2 years, with an average of 1.5 cm/y (range, 0.5-2.3 cm/y). During the treatment period, complication of hook dislodgement occurred in 1 of 11 patients (9.1%).
   CONCLUSIONS: The combined halo gravity traction and dual growing rod technique can safely and effectively correct NF1-associated scoliosis. This is an ongoing study that requires long-term follow-up.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate effectiveness of brace treatment in patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis with curve between 40 degrees and 45 degrees and to determine predictive factors associated with bracing outcome.
   METHODS: Bracing was used to treat 90 patients with curve > 40 degrees. Factors including Risser sign, age, sex, curve pattern, curve magnitude, and initial curve correction were compared between patients with curve improvement and patients with curve progression. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the independent predictors of curve progression.
   RESULTS: Curve was improved in 34 (37.8%) patients and stabilized in 12 (13.3%) patients. Remarkable curve progression > 50 degrees was observed in 44 (48.9%) patients. Intergroup comparison showed significant differences between the 2 groups in terms of age (12.3 +/- 1.4 years vs. 13.2 +/- 1.6 years, P = 0.01), initial curve correction (2.2% +/- 5.4% vs. 19.7% +/- 12.2%, P < 0.001), and curve pattern (P = 0.03). Logistic regression analysis showed that initial curve correction of < 10% (odds ratio = 12.82, P < 0.001) and Risser grade of 0 (odds ratio = 1.46, P = 0.04) were significant indicators of curve progression.
   CONCLUSIONS: Bracing may produce a favorable outcome in certain patients with curve between 40 degrees and 45 degrees. It should be cautiously used in this situation, as there was a higher probability of bracing failure. It is important to differentiate patients at high risk of curve progression at an early stage to avoid overtreatment.

AB OBJECTIVE: S2 alar screw would be an alternative choice without breaking the sacroiliac joint. The aim of this study was to measure radiographic parameters for optimal placement of posterior S2 alar screw for instrumentation and fusion.
   METHODS: Three-dimensional computed tomography scans of the pelvis of 60 normal adults were used to map the S2 alar screw. Entry point was typically chosen lateral and superior to the S2 dorsal foramen. Ideal S2 alar screw trajectories were explored by rotating the three-dimensional pelvis, while ensuring trajectories were of maximum length and width. After identification of an optimal trajectory, related linear anatomic parameters and sagittal and transverse angles were determined.
   RESULTS: Ideal S2 alar screw trajectories were identified in each computed tomography scan. According to this morphometric study, trajectories for female patients were more lateral in the transverse plane (female 33.73 +/- 5.99 degrees vs. male 29.82 +/- 4.11 degrees, P < 0.001). Maximal length of trajectory in male patients was significantly longer than in female patients (female 40.82 +/- 4.29 mm vs. male 43.42 +/- 4.02 mm, P = 0.001). Fourteen S2 alar screws were used in 7 patients with high-grade spondylolisthesis, scoliosis, or nonunion at lumbosacral site. No complications occurred during S2 alar screw placement. One S2 screw failed owing to severe local osteoporosis. No patient developed local pain or wound-related problems.
   CONCLUSIONS: S2 alar screw is an alternative sacral fixation point to provide additional biomechanical stability of lumbosacral constructs. A trajectory with maximum length through the S2 ala can be determined using three-dimensional computed tomography.

AB OBJECTIVE: We determined the feasibility of minimally invasive surgery for severe adult spinal deformities and proposed a reassessment system and staged minimally invasive surgical strategy.
   METHODS: We treated 53 patients from June 2016 to August 2017 using a reassessment system and a staged surgical strategy with minimally invasive techniques for minimally invasive spinal deformity surgery, class III. Patients with scoliotic apex vertebrae above L1-L2 or spontaneous fusion of the facet joints were excluded. The reassessment system was applied. The first stage involved multisegmental lateral lumbar interbody fusion and anterior column realignment (ACR), and the second stage involved posterior minimally invasive surgery. The pre- and postoperative visual analog scale scores, Oswestry disability index, surgical data, and radiographic images were collected. The major and minor complications were recorded.
   RESULTS: All the patients were followed up for 11.5 months (range, 6-20). Lateral lumbar interbody fusion was performed in 168 segments, of which 113 had ACR. The average sagittal correction angle of each ACR segment was 15.6 degrees +/- 6.3 degrees (range, 7 degrees-28 degrees). The correction rate of the Cobb angle for lumbar scoliosis after first stage was 55.4%, and the total correction rate was 75.6%. The lumbar lordosise-pelvic index mismatch was improved from -32.8 degrees +/- 14.9 degrees to -2.5 degrees +/- 9.4 degrees, reaching the sagittal matching state of the lumbar spine.
   CONCLUSIONS: A reassessment system and minimally invasive staged surgery for severe adult spinal deformity can achieve good clinical outcomes and deformity correction and might have the advantage of decreasing unnecessary iatrogenic injury.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of dual stent-assisted coiling in treatment of intracranial complex and wide-necked bifurcation aneurysms, we have reported our own center experience and performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the reported data.
   METHODS: The experience in our center was reviewed and a comprehensive search of the reported data on dual stent-assisted treatment of intracranial complex and wide-necked bifurcation aneurysms was performed using the databases PubMed, Ovid EMBASE, and Ovid MEDLINE before October 1, 2018. Information was extracted regarding patient demographic data, clinical characteristics, radiographic data, treatment outcomes, complications, and clinical and angiographic follow-up data. The data were analyzed using random effects and fixed effects meta-analyses.
   RESULTS: Including our series of 26 patients, the data from 21 studies with 721 patients were analyzed. The procedure was technically successful in 97.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 96.5%-98.7%). The complete occlusion rate was 61.6% (95% CI, 47.3%-75.8%) immediately after the procedure compared with 88.4% (95% CI, 84.6%-92.2%) at the last follow-up examination. The rate of periprocedural complications, total complications, procedure-related mortality was 8.8% (95% CI, 5.8%-11.9%), 9.5% (95% CI, 6.2%-12.9%), and 1.1% (95% CI, 0.3%-1.8%), respectively. The recurrence rate, retreatment rate, and good neurologic outcome rate was 3.3% (95% CI, 2.0%-4.7%), 2.7% (95% CI, 1.5%-4.0%), and 96.6% (95% CI, 95.0%-98.1%), respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: The dual stent-assisted coiling technique is a feasible and effective option for the treatment of intracranial complex and wide-necked bifurcation aneurysms. It results in a relatively low rate of procedure-related complications and mortality and recurrence and a high rate of mid-term complete occlusion and good neurologic outcomes.

ID CONSTRUCTIVE INTERFERENCE; CIRCULATION; STATE; FEATURES
AB OBJECTIVE: The involved carotid forks in moyamoya disease (MMD) will show decreases in both luminal caliber and outer diameter. The present study aimed to clarify the changes in the outer diameter associated with luminal stenosis/occlusion of the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) in patients with MMD.
   METHODS: The present study included 24 pediatric and 48 adult patients with MMD and 17 healthy adult controls. Using magnetic resonance angiography, the degree of PCA involvement was classified into 3 grades: grade 0, normal; grade 1, stenotic; and grade 2, occluded. Using 3-dimensional constructive interference in steady state, the outer diameters were quantified in the P2 segment. All the patients were followed up to identify the disease progression in the PCA.
   RESULTS: The outer diameter of the P2 segment significantly decreased in a stepwise fashion in parallel with the severity of the luminal stenosis. In pediatric patients, the outer diameters of the P2 segments were 2.0 +/- 0.26 mm, 1.5 +/- 0.42 mm, and 0.87 +/- 0.15 mm in those with grade 0, 1, and 2, respectively (P < 0.001). In adult patients, the outer diameters of the P2 segments were 2.0 +/- 0.34 mm, 1.5 +/- 0.34 mm, and 1.1 +/- 0.17 mm in those with grade 0, 1, and 2, respectively (P < 0.001). We found no significant difference between grade 0 PCA of the adult patients and the PCA of the healthy controls (P = 0.92). Disease progression led to further arterial shrinkage of the P2 segment (n = 4).
   CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study have shown that the involved PCA demonstrates, not only luminal stenosis, but also arterial shrinkage in MMD. This finding strongly suggests that the underlying mechanism in the development of MMD is common in both the carotid fork and PCA.

ID OPIOID CONSUMPTION; ANESTHESIA
AB BACKGROUND: Spinal surgery is a procedure that causes intense and severe pain in the postoperative period. Erector spinae plane (ESP) block can target the dorsal-ventral rami of thoracolumbar nerves, but its effect on lumbar surgery is unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the ESP block on postoperative opioid consumption and pain scores in patients undergoing spinal surgery.
   METHODS: Sixty patients undergoing open lumbar decompression surgery were randomly assigned to 2 groups. The ESP Group (n = 30) received ultrasound-guided bilateral ESP block with 0.25% bupivacaine 20 mL. In the Control Group (n = 30), no intervention was performed. Postoperative analgesia was performed intravenously twice a day with 400 mg ibuprofen and patient-controlled analgesia with tramadol. Postoperative visual analogue scale scores, opioid consumption, rescue analgesia, and opioid-related side effects were evaluated.
   RESULTS: Compared with the Control Group, the visual analogue scale scores were statistically lower in the ESP Group during all measurements of time, both at rest and active movement (P < 0.05). Tramadol consumption was lower in the ESP Group compared with the Control Group at all time periods (P < 0.05). Twenty-four hour tramadol consumption in the Control Group was significantly higher compared with the ESP Group (370.33 +/- 73.27 mg and 268.33 +/- 71.44 mg; P < 0.001, respectively) and the difference was 28%, and time to first analgesic requirement was significantly longer in the ESP Group than in the Control Group.
   CONCLUSIONS: ESP block can be used in multimodal analgesia practice to reduce opioid consumption and relieve acute postoperative pain in patients undergoing open lumbar decompression surgery.

AB BACKGROUND: We report the experience of the FlowGate(2) (FG2) as a new balloon guide catheter in endovascular stroke intervention.
   METHODS: We evaluated the various outcomes and complications of patients with intracranial large artery occlusion undergoing endovascular stroke intervention with FG2 at our center. Baseline characteristics (failure rate of device application, sex, age, risk factors, arterial occlusion sites, and time intervals) were reviewed. Outcomes were evaluated according to National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score, number of stent passages required, and Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction score. The incidence of hemorrhage, vessel damage, distal emboli, and mortality rate were evaluated as indicators of complications.
   RESULTS: Overall, 70 patients were enrolled, except the 2 patients with application failure of FG2. Seventy patients with a median age of 69 years were treated with FG2. Arterial occlusion involved the M1 (50%) and M2 (14.3%) segments, internal carotid artery (25.7%), and posterior circulation (10%). Median value of mRS at 90 days was 2.8, and 37 patients (52.8%) had a mRS score <= 2. The recanalization rate in patients with a Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction score of 2b or 3 was 91.4%. The hemorrhage rate was 5.7%, but none were symptomatic. In terms of complications, distal emboli occurred in 4.3% of cases.
   CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular stroke intervention with the FG2 is safe and effective with good accessibility and less occurrence of distal emboli. Its trackability, stability, and luminal size make the FG2 suitable for stroke intervention.

AB OBJECTIVE: Endoscopic partial facetectomy (EPF) is an effective option for decompressing the lumbar exiting root without causing spinal instabilities in the treatment of patients with degenerative lumbar foraminal stenosis. The aim of the present study was to identify the preoperative risk factors of poor clinical outcomes after EPF in patients with degenerative lumbar foraminal stenosis.
   METHODS: A total of 51 consecutive patients who had undergone EPF from 2012 to 2015 were included in the present study. The clinical outcomes were evaluated using the visual analog scale (VAS), Oswestry disability index (ODI), and Short-Form 36-item (SF-36) outcome questionnaires. The preoperative radiological risk factors were measured using the lumbar Cobb's angle, disc wedging angle, lumbar lordosis (LL), segmental lordosis, disc height index, presence of spondylolisthesis, and morphological changes (no change, horizontal collapse, vertical collapse) of the exiting root within the most stenotic level on preoperative magnetic resonance imaging.
   RESULTS: The VAS, ODI, and SF-36 scores had significantly improved at the 1-month follow-up visit compared with the baseline mean values and were maintained within the 2-year follow-up period. A correlation analysis revealed significant relationships between various preoperative factors and clinical outcomes. On multiple regression analysis, the morphological change of vertical collapse significantly predicted the VAS, ODI, and SF-36 scores, and LL significantly predicted the ODI and SF-36 scores.
   CONCLUSIONS: A morphological change in vertical collapse found on preoperative magnetic resonance imaging and decreased LL were significant predictors of poor clinical outcomes after EPF in the treatment of lumbar foraminal stenosis.

AB OBJECTIVE: Delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) happens in about 30% of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and is related to higher mortality and disability. Some studies have shown cerebral autoregulation impairment can be a predictor of DCI in aneurysmal SAH. We conducted this meta-analysis to evaluate the predictive value of cerebral autoregulation impairment for DCI based on the current literature.
   METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed and Embase. According to inclusion and exclusion criteria, 2 authors screened the records and extracted data from the included studies. Pooled sensitivity, specificity, and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained. To investigate the overall accuracy, a summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve was built and the area under SROC curve was calculated. Deeks' linear regression was used to assess the publication bias. All statistical analyses were performed with Stata 14.0.
   RESULTS: A total of 7 studies were finally included in this meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivity and specificity values of impaired cerebral autoregulation for DCI prediction were 0.79 (95% CI, 0.65-0.88) and 0.85 (95% CI, 0.615-0.96). Moreover, the area under the SROC curve of cerebral autoregulation impairment for DCI prediction was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.835-0.89). No obvious publication bias was found in Deeks' linear regression (P = 0.99).
   CONCLUSIONS: Cerebral autoregulation impairment can be a helpful predictor of DCI in aneurysmal SAH. Its accuracy for DCI prediction should be verified by more studies in the future.

   ACCURACY
AB OBJECTIVE: The BAT score is a novel prediction score of hematoma expansion based on noncontrast computed tomography (CT) and consists of the blend sign, hypodensities, and time interval from onset to CT. This study aimed to compare the BAT score and the spot sign on CT angiography in a cohort of patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage.
   METHODS: Eligible patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage were analyzed retrospectively. The BAT score and the spot sign were assessed according to the criteria described in previous studies. Receiver operating curve analysis was used to assess the performance of the BAT score and the spot sign in hematoma expansion prediction.
   RESULTS: In 225 included patients, 34 (15.1%) had a BAT score >= 3. The spot sign was shown in 68 (30.2%) patients. Hematoma expansion was identified in 56 (24.9%) patients. In multivariate analysis, both BAT score >= 3 and presence of spot sign were independently correlated with hematoma expansion. BAT score >= 3 had 0.41 sensitivity and 0.93 specificity, and spot sign had 0.64 sensitivity and 0.81 specificity. The area under the curve of BAT score >= 3 and area under the curve of spot sign were 0.673 and 0.727, respectively (P = 0.386).
   CONCLUSIONS: The BAT score based on noncontrast CT is a good predictor of hematoma expansion. When CT angiography spot sign is unobtainable, the BAT score can be used to predict hematoma expansion.

ID CONTINUOUS EEG; VASOSPASM; PERFUSION
AB OBJECTIVE: Delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) is significantly related to death and unfavorable functional outcome in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The association between alpha-delta ratio (ADR) on quantitative electroencephalography (EEG) and DCI has been reported in several previous studies, but their results are conflicting. This meta-analysis was conducted to assess the accuracy of ADR for DCI prediction in patients with aneurysmal SAH.
   METHODS: PubMed and Embase were systematically searched for related records. Study selection and data collection were completed by 2 investigators. Sensitivity, specificity, and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled. A summary receiver operating characteristic curve was plotted to show the pooled accuracy. Deeks funnel plot was used to evaluate publication bias.
   RESULTS: Five studies were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of worsening ADR for DCI prediction in patients with aneurysmal SAH were 0.83 (95% CI 0.44-0.97) and 0.74 (95% CI 0.50-0.89), respectively. In addition, the area under the summary receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.84 (95% CI 0.81-0.87). No obvious publication bias was found using Deeks funnel plot (P = 0.29).
   CONCLUSIONS: Worsening ADR on quantitative EEG is a reliable predictor of DCI in patients with aneurysmal SAH. Further studies are still needed to confirm the role of quantitative EEG in DCI prediction.

AB BACKGROUND: Normal sagittal alignment shows a range of variations and normal values. This study compared sagittal vertebral alignment in patients with different degenerative lumbar diseases.
   METHODS: This cross-sectional study evaluated 300 patients who were enrolled between June 2016 and June 2017. Of these patients, 213 met the study criteria and were included.
   RESULTS: Of the 213 patients, 66 were men (31%) and 147 were women (68.2%). The mean age was 62.7 years. Diagnoses included degenerative spondylolisthesis in 116 patients (52.7%), lumbar disk degeneration in 76 patients (34.5%), lumbar spinal stenosis in 19 patients (8.6%), and lytic spondylolisthesis in 7 patients (3.2%). The most frequent Roussouly type of sagittal alignment was type 3 (33.6%), followed by type 4 (25.9%). No significant correlation was associated with Roussouly type of sagittal alignment and lumbar degenerative disease. Median sagittal vertebral alignment parameters in the series were as follows: pelvic incidence (PI), 60.55 degrees +/- 15.62 degrees; sacral slope, 39.09 degrees +/- 12.48 degrees; pelvic tilt, 20.92 degrees +/- 8.99 degrees; lumbar lordosis, 33.15 degrees +/- 18.49 degrees; and sagittal balance, 19.64 +/- 55.27 mm. One hundred sixteen patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis had significant greater PI than those with other diagnoses (61.56 degrees vs. 58.3 degrees, respectively; P = 0.005), and patients with lumbar spinal stenosis had significantly lower PI than those with other diagnoses (55.89 degrees vs. 60.44 degrees, respectively; P = 0.005).
   CONCLUSIONS: Pelvic incidence may play a predisposing role in the pathogenesis of lumbar degenerative disease. Patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis have greater pelvic incidence with increased lumbar lordosis. In contrast, patients with spinal stenosis have lower pelvic incidence with flatter lumbar lordosis.

DT Article
DE Cavernous dural arteriovenous fistula; Computed tomography angiography;

ID ENDOVASCULAR TREATMENT; CONFLUENCE PATTERN; VEIN; EMBOLIZATION
AB BACKGROUND: Inferior petrosal sinus (IPS) has been commonly adopted as a route for embolizing cavernous dural arteriovenous fistula (cDAVF). According to previous anatomical studies, > 90% of persons have an IPS. Because the exact confluence position of the IPS with an internal jugular vein can be difficult to obtain using preoperative digital subtraction angiography (DSA), catheterizing into the IPS during endovascular treatment can sometimes be very difficult. Because the anatomical information has not been attainable, this route has not been as widely used. Thus, methods remain to be developed to allow the IPS to play its due role in the embolization of cDAVF.
   METHODS: Seven cases of cDAVF were diagnosed by DSA. The 7 patients also underwent preoperative computed tomography angiography (CTA) and were treated by transvenous embolization.
   RESULTS: Compared with DSA, the confluence position of the IPS with the internal jugular vein was easier to find using preoperative CTA in 6 cases. Based on this anatomical information, 6 cases were successfully embolized via the IPS route and 1 via the superior ophthalmic vein route.
   CONCLUSIONS: Detailed anatomical information of the IPS can be obtained from preoperative CTA images. Thus, CTA can help localize the IPS and allow for embolization of cDAVF via the IPS route.

AB OBJECTIVE: To develop a method to distinguish atypical meningiomas (AMs) with malignant progression (MP) from primary AMs without a clinical history.
   METHODS: The clinical, radiologic, and pathologic data of 33 previously Simpson grade I resected (if any) as well as no radiotherapy treated intracranial AMs between January 2008 and December 2015 were reviewed. Immunohistochemical staining for connexin 43 (Cx43) and Ki-67 was performed. Descriptive analysis and univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to explore independent predictors of MP. A multivariable logistic model was developed to estimate the risk of MP, and its diagnostic value was determined from a receiver operating characteristic curve.
   RESULTS: There were 11 AMs (33.3%) with histopathologically confirmed MP from benign meningiomas. The other 22 (66.7%) were initially diagnosed AMs with no histopathologically confirmedMP during a median 60.5 months (range, 42e126 months) of follow-up. Univariate and multivariate logistic analyses showed that irregular tumor shape (P = 0.010) and lowCx43 expression (P=0.010) were independent predictors of the presence of MP, and the predicted probability was calculated by the following formula: P =1/[1+exp.{1.218-(3.2023xShape)+(3.8143xCx43)}]. P > 0.5 for an irregularly shaped (score 1) AM with low Cx43 expression (score 0) indicated a high probability of MP. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and overall predictive accuracy were 63.6, 95.6, 87.5, 84.0, and 84.8%, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: Low Cx43 expression and irregular tumor shape were independent predictors of the presence of MP. The relevant logistic regression model was found to be effective in distinguishing MP-AMs from primary AMs.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical characteristics of hypopituitarism and its reversibility after surgery for nonfunctional pituitary adenoma (NFPA); analyze the correlation between tumor size and hypopituitarism incidence; and predict hypopituitarism by tumor volume and maximum diameter.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 164 patients with NFPA who underwent surgical treatment at Peking Union Medical College Hospital from January 2016 to December 2016. Demographic, imaging, and endocrine data were collected during preoperative, postoperative, and long-term follow-up (21.1 +/- 3.3 months) periods. Differences in hormone levels were analyzed by paired and independent samples t-tests. The cut-off values of tumor size and volume to predict hypopituitarism were calculated by receiver operating characteristic curves.
   RESULTS: In total, 80.4% (132/164) of patients had anterior pituitary hypofunction and 48.4% patients had hypogonadism; the recovery rate of luteinizing hormone was 80.9%, and follicular-stimulating hormone was 60%. In total, 36.5% of patients had hypothyroidism; the recovery rate of thyroxine was 85%, free thyroxine was 87.8%, and thyroid-stimulating hormone was 100.0%. Finally, 27.4% of patients had insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1)/growth hormone (GH) hypofunction, and the recovery rate of IGF-1 was 77.8%. The preoperative free thyroxine, thyroxine, GH, IGF-1, follicular-stimulating hormone, and luteinizing hormone levels were significantly lower in the giant adenoma group (n = 43) than in the large adenoma group (n = 121). The hypopituitarism predictive cut-off value of tumor volume was 3105.1 mm(3) and that of tumor diameter was 23.5 mm.
   CONCLUSIONS: NFPA has a significant influence on gonadal hormone, IGF-1/GH, and thyroid hormone. NFPA can cause single- or multiple-hormone reduction in each pituitary target gland. Tumor size is positively correlated with the incidence and degree of hypopituitarism. NFPA-induced hypopituitarism is significantly recovered after surgical treatment.

AB OBJECTIVE: We tested the hypothesis that low serum iron levels are associated with acute hydrocephalus following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH).
   METHODS: Patients presenting with ruptured intracranial aneurysms were enrolled in the prospective observational study. Age, sex, history of diabetes, hypertension and hyperlipidemia, symptom onset, Fisher grade, Hunt-Hess grade, aneurysm location, hemoglobin, and serum iron were collected. Acute hydrocephalus was determined within 72 hours after subarachnoid hemorrhage. A propensity-score matching analysis was performed to correct imbalances in patient characteristics between hydrocephalus and non-hydrocephalus groups.
   RESULTS: A total of 535 patients were included. Incidence of acute hydrocephalus was 20.0%. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, lower serum iron was considered as a risk factor of acute hydrocephalus, as well as delayed ischemic neurologic deficit and lower hemoglobin (P = 0.000). After propensity-score matching, lower serum iron was considered as an independent risk factor for acute hydrocephalus, whereas hemoglobin and delayed ischemic neurologic deficit were not. The matched hydrocephalus group had lower serum iron comparing with the matched non-hydrocephalus group (10.26 +/- 5.33 mmol/L vs. 13.44 +/- 5.18 mmol/L; P = 0.000). The optimal cut-off value for serum iron levels as a predictor for acute hydrocephalus in patients with aSAH was determined as 13.1 mmol/L in the receiver operating characteristic curve. Furthermore, lower serum iron levels (odds ratio 0.305; 95% confidence interval, 0.178-0.524; P = 0.000) and acute hydrocephalus (odds ratio 0.372; 95% confidence interval, 0.202-0.684; P = 0.001) were predictors of poor outcome, as well as higher Hunt-Hess grade and Fisher grade.
   CONCLUSIONS: Lower serum iron levels after aSAH was a predictor of acute hydrocephalus and unfavorable outcome.

TI Endovascular Coiling versus Surgical Clipping of Very Small Ruptured

   Coiling; Rupture; Outcome
ID OUTCOMES; SIZE
AB BACKGROUND: Endovascular coiling of anterior communicating artery (ACoA) aneurysms has evolved dramatically. Ruptured ACoA aneurysms are more likely to be smaller. We aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of endovascular coiling of very small ruptured ACoA aneurysms compared with surgical clipping.
   METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of consecutive 111 patients with very small ruptured ACoA aneurysms treated with endovascular coiling or surgical clipping in our single center. Very small aneurysms were defined as aneurysm maximal size <= 3.0 mm. Patients were grouped into coiling and clipping groups. Baseline characteristics, postoperative complications, and clinical outcomes were compared between the 2 groups.
   RESULTS: Forty-six patients (41.1%) underwent successfully coiling, and 65 patients (58.0%) underwent surgical clipping, including 2 patients who failed coiling and crossed over to surgical clipping. The mean size of the ruptured ACoA aneurysms was 2.6 +/- 0.5 mm (range, 1.0-3.0 mm). Patients with smaller aneurysms (P = 0.028) or A1 segment complete configuration (P = 0.009) more often underwent surgical clipping, and patients with A1 segment symmetric configuration more often underwent coiling (P = 0.011). There were not statistically significant differences in intraoperative rupture, early rebleeding, cerebral infarction, and seizure in patients treated with clipping and coiling. Clinical outcomes were similar between the 2 groups. There was no retreatment in both groups.
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients with very small ruptured ACoA aneurysms can be safely and effectively treated with endovascular coiling. However, smaller ACoA aneurysms still require surgical clipping. A smaller aneurysm size limits the use of endovascular coiling.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate values of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum procalcitonin (PCT) for diagnosis of intracranial infection after craniotomy and relationship between them and to explore value of PCT in guiding clinical use of antibiotics.
   METHODS: The incidence of intracranial infection in 21 patients undergoing craniotomy was reviewed. CSF samples and venous blood were collected for analysis. Diagnostic parameters were calculated via receiver operating characteristic curves, and inflammatory indicators were analyzed before and after administration of antibiotics in the infection group. As a control group, 32 patients without infection were recruited for the same measurements.
   RESULTS: CSF and serum PCT levels in the infection group were higher than levels in the noninfection group (P < 0.05), and diagnostic efficiency of CSF PCT (area under the curve = 0.86, diagnostic odds ratio = 41.40) was superior to serum PCT (area under the curve = 0.66, diagnostic odds ratio = 3.40). Diagnostic efficiency was more powerful when serial testing was used (specificity = 0.99, positive likelihood ratio = 37.10, diagnostic odds ratio = 54.45). All inflammatory indicators decreased after administration of antibiotics except CSF protein (P = 0.129), and no obvious correlation was seen between CSF and serum PCT. Dynamic change of PCT can be used as a reference for adjusting antibiotics. CSF PCT can also be used as an indicator to identify intracranial infection with gram-negative bacteria.
   CONCLUSIONS: CSF PCT is a good marker for intracranial infection and could be used to help confirm intracranial infection and provide guidance for clinical use of antibiotics when combined with serum PCT.

AB The direct-current electrical conductivities (sigma) of 70V(2)O(5)center dot 30TeO(2) (mol%) pelletized glasses annealed in an H-2 gas atmosphere at 473 K were determined in the temperature (7) range of 322-473 K. Based on the log(sigma 7)-T-1 relation in the considered temperature range, the electrical conduction is discussed in detail. The conduction of each glass sample at high temperatures (T > similar to 460 K) was attributed to nonadiabatic small polaron hopping. At T < similar to 353 K, the slopes of the curves were the smallest. The smallest slopes at temperatures below 353 K are discussed based on the Mott's and Greaves' variable-range hopping (VRH) conduction models. The tunneling factors a and densities of states at the Fermi level N(E-F) estimated using the Mott's VRH model confirmed that this model was not suitable. On the other hand, the alpha and N(E-F) values estimated by the Greaves' VRH model indicated that the conduction was attributed to the Greaves VRH. The values of W-D (0.0765 +/- .0006 to 0.108 +/- .0006 eV) calculated using the Greaves' model were on the same order as those of the reported vanadate binary glasses. These parameters demonstrated that the Greaves' VRH model was applicable for the considered glasses and could be used to explain the conductivity data at temperatures below similar to 354 K.

AB The solid-state phase transformation in a lithium disilicate-based glass-ceramic (IPS e.max (R) CAD) was revisited on the basis of quantitative data. IPS e.max (R) CAD is widely used as material for the dental restoration in the dental industry. In-situ X-ray diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry accompanied by scanning electron microscopy observations were applied to understand phase transformation during heat treatment in a dental ceramic. In-situ X-ray diffraction evidences the concomitant formation of cristobalite and lithium orthophosphate at 770 degrees C. Then, the formation of lithium disilicate occurred at the expense of a complete dissolution of cristobalite and lithium metasilicate. No phase transformation occurred during cooling. The quantitative results of microstructural features (amount of each phase, morphology, and number density of lithium disilicate and lithium metasilicate) indicate that lithium disilicate is probably formed by diffusional process at the lithium metasilicate/cristobalite interface, which acts as favorable nucleation sites. The energy barrier is probably too high for lithium disilicate nucleation in the amorphous matrix. The quantitative results will provide the background for further modeling of phase transformation kinetics, which may have potential industrial benefits.

AB A foam ceramic was prepared using molybdenum tailings (97-99.5 wt%) as the raw material and SiC as the foaming agent. The results showed that with increasing SiC content, the liquid-phase viscosity decreased, which in turn enhanced the overall expansion of the system, leading to a decrease in the thermal conductivity. The effects of the SiC content on the bulk density, porosity, pore size, and thermal conductivity were investigated in detail. Moreover, the experimental results were compared with several analytical models, and we found that the parallel model closely agreed with the predictions. The sample prepared via sintering at 1150 degrees C using 2.5 wt% SiC and molybdenum tailings exhibited a low bulk density of 0.37 g/cm(3), high porosity of 85.14%, and low thermal conductivity of 0.22W/m.K. Thus, the application of molybdenum tailings in the production of foamed materials is considered to have potential economic and environmental advantages.

AB Strontium tellurite, lead tellurite and bismuth niobium tellurite glasses containing 1 to 2 mol% of Eu3+ and Er3+ were prepared by melt-quenching and found to contain anti-glass inclusions (droplet phase) of size of several micrometers. Anti-glasses are disordered crystals that have long-range order of the cations such as Sr2+, Pb2+, Bi3+, Nb5+ and Te4+ but have a disordered arrangement of the anions (O2-), therefore these materials exhibit sharp peaks in the X-ray diffraction patterns due to the long range cationic order but the Raman spectra show broad bands due to the vibrational disorder. The glass matrix and anti-glass inclusions in the samples were characterized by synchrotron micro-X-ray Fluorescence (XRF), Raman and photoluminescence mapping studies. The XRF line analysis confirmed that the anti-glass and glass matrix phases have equal concentration of metal ions. The samples containing Eu3+ show intense red photoluminescence at an excitation wavelength of 375 nm, while Er3+ doped samples exhibit strong green emission by the up-conversion of infrared photons (980 nm). The spatially resolved XRF, Raman and photoluminescence spectroscopy found that the inclusions and the glass matrix have the same metal ion concentration, short-range order, Te-O speciation and the light emission properties.

AB Glass-ceramics from the Na1+xAlxGe2-x(PO4)(3) system were synthesized for 0 <= x <= 1.0. The stability parameters of precursor glasses were analyzed indicating that systematic additions of aluminum in the NaGe2(PO4)(3) composition improve the precursor glass forming ability. Considering the glass-ceramics, it is observed that an increase in the aluminum content, x, causes a decrease in the activation energy for conduction, and thus an increase in the ionic conductivity. As x increases, beyond the corresponding increase in the charge carrier (Na+) concentration, it is also observed an increase in the unit cell volume of the NASICON structure, which may also contribute to the enhancement of ionic conductivity. Concerning the microstructure, the addition of aluminum provokes an increase in the average grain-size of the obtained glass-ceramics. Ionic conductivity increases up to x = 0.8 but remains constant within the experimental error for the x = 1.0 sample, probably due to a limit in the solid solution range. Ionic conductivity of composition x = 0.8 is still improved by applying higher crystallization temperatures, which decreases the activation energy for ionic conduction.

AB The Vickers hardness, Young's modulus, and shear modulus of xZnO-(67-x)SnO-33P(2)O(5) glasses increase with increasing values of x, in agreement with predictions that consider the quantitative structural information regarding coordination numbers of Zn2+ and Sn2+ ions by diffraction methods, and phosphate anion distributions by NMR methods, reported in an earlier study. The compositional dependence of the shear modulus falls into two ranges which correlate with trends in photoelasticity, and the elastic and photoelastic properties are explained considering changes in ion packing ratio and average bond strengths when ZnO replaces SnO.

AB This work presents a new route to synthesis nanomaterials for nonlinear optical devices, Nd:YAG laser irradiation is considered as recent technique for precipitation of nanoparticles in glassy matrix. Precipitation of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in silicate glasses is achieved by Nd:YAG nanosecond laser irradiation to soda lime silicate glasses doped with silver nitrate (AgNO3) using melt annealing technique. The influences of different concentrations of AgNO3 on the optical and the structural characterization of the precipitated glasses were investigated using; XRD, FT-IR, UV-Vis, and HRTEM. An obvious change in color was observed inside the silicate glasses regions after laser irradiation, which was attributed to the growth of silver nanoparticles in the glass.XRD patterns indicate the presence of sharp diffraction peaks of AgNPs after laser irradiation due to precipitated AgNPs in silicate glasses. FT-IR spectra of the precipitated samples show a little change in intensity for the sample before and after the laser irradiation combined with the identification of a new band that approves the precipitated AgNPs. The optical absorption spectra confirm the formation of the precipitated AgNPs inside the silicate glasses by appearance of Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) and the intensity of the absorption peak increases with an increase of the silver nitrate concentration. TEM micrographs confirm the precipitation of silver within the samples after laser irradiation.

AB sIn this study, experiments are carried out to demonstrate that in laser welding of a Zr-based (Zr52.5Ti5Al10Ni14Cu17.9) bulk metallic glass (BMG), pre-existing nuclei nucleus density has significant influence on its crystallization behavior. Based on the classical nucleation/growth theory, it is concluded that a small amount of pre-existing nuclei in a BMG can shift the time-temperature-transformation (TTT) curve from a well-known 'C-shape' to a 'epsilon-shape.' This result provides fundamental understanding on why the shape of the TTT curve for a heating process is different from that for a cooling process for the same BMG. Two quality factors were defined as a measure of the effect of pre-existing nucleus density. By integrating the classical nucleation/growth theory with the heat transfer model, the evolution of crystalline phase during laser welding for a BMG with pre-existing nuclei was studied, and the modeling predictions compared favorably with the experimental results.

Structural features of these glass-ceramics were explored by their crystalline phase analysis and morphological studies after sintering at various temperatures (850-1000 degrees C) for 2 h (h). The samples exhibited near super paramagnetic nature which would be helpful for heat generation purposes (such as in hyperthermia treatment of cancer). Magnetic properties of the glass-ceramics are dependent on the crystallized phases grown upon sintering. Concentration dependent role of TiO2 is discussed based upon the obtained results.

AB Other than Fe-based amorphous alloys, the atomic configurations of amorphous pure Fe exhibit abundant topological local structures and exclude chemical effects on the local magnetic moment of a Fe atom. We thus employed amorphous pure Fe to investigate the structural-magnetic properties relationship by ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Our results showed that the decreased volume leads to a reduction of absolute values of both positive and negative magnetic moments, which agrees with earlier investigations. Further, we employed the minimum coordination polyhedrons with the coordination number of 5-10 to depict the local structures, and found that there is a strong correlation between the minimum coordination polyhedrons and local magnetic moments. The local magnetic moments increase with the coordination number of the minimum coordination polyhedron; the larger distortion of the minimum coordination polyhedron corresponds to larger average magnetic moments.

AB The structural and mechanical responses of Ti-based and Zr-based metallic glasses (MGs) treated by the nanosecond laser shock wave were investigated. A rejuvenation transition was observed, due to the structural rearrangement of neighboring atoms in the instantaneous shock process. Plenty of embryonic shear bands occurred along the shock-affected zone. A damped model of the shock pressure was established to describe the characteristic of the embryonic shear bands. The results showed that the shear band initiation in the nanosecond scale along the length direction was divided into two stages: the initial low propagation stage and the following fast propagation stage, because of the reduction of the shock pressure. The hardness of the shock-affected zone displayed a maximal decrease of 25% in the critical zone between the two propagation stages, due to the combined effect of the structural rejuvenation and the compressive residual stress. A schematic of the energy landscape was proposed to explain the relationship between the rejuvenation and the formation of the embryonic shear bands. The maximum tensile plasticity increased by 0.46%. The results demonstrated that the MGs possessed different shear band propagation modes in the initiation stages, which deepened the understanding of the deformation mechanism in the MGs.

AB The effects of the concentration on the glass formation, the crystallization process, and atomic structure of Zr100-xCox (x = 10, 30, 50, 70, and 90) alloys were investigated by classical molecular dynamics simulation based on the embedded atom method during rapid quenching. The structural evolution of these systems was evaluated by analyzing some structural functions and structural characterization methods. The calculated coordination number and structure factor were compared with the experimental data and it was observed that there was a good agreement between the molecular dynamics simulation and experimental results. Simulations performed for this study revealed that the local environment depends on the atomic composition in the Zr-Co alloy. The liquid - glass transition was observed for the concentrations of Co in the range of 30-90%, which is consistent with the experimental glass forming range for Zr100-xCox alloys. The Voronoi and Honeycutt-Andersen pair analysis showed that the number of pairs and bonds reflecting the development of the icosahedral short range order increased with increased Co concentration and the Zr30Co70 alloy, having a large number of ideal and distorted icosahedrons with respect to other compositions considered in present study, has the highest fraction of Co-centered full icosahedral <0,0,12,0> clusters. Analysis results showed that in Zr90Co10 alloy, the number of <0,6,0,8> clusters denoting the transition to bcc structure remarkably increased, and <0,3,6,4>, <0,5,2,6> and <0,4,4,6> clusters play a key role during the crystallization process.

AB In the present study the magnetic, magneto-optical, morphological and microstructural properties of the amorphous Fe83Cu1Nb3Si5B8 alloy were thoroughly investigated in accordance with various annealing circumstances. The kinetic nanocrystallization temperatures of certain ribbon were determined at the range of 500-515 degrees C. Furthermore, optimum heat treatment conditions were sought in the air atmosphere (AA), in vacuum (VA) and in vacuum with the presence of longitudinal magnetic field (LFA) at 70 A/m. This study aimed to put forward a quantitative explanation of the advantages of LFA in terms of several factors such as magnetic properties, microstructural evaluation and magneto-optical effects. The present nanocrystalline Fe83Cu1Nb3Si5B8 alloy has allowed the yielding of ultrafine grain structure correlated with the literature results. Accordingly, average grain size of 5.9 nm, saturation induction of 1.84 T and coercivity of 6.4 A.m(-1) and saturation magnetostriction as low as 6 ppm were obtained as a result of LFA implementation. However, the sample subjected to VA under the same circumstances showed relatively lower magnetic and microstructural capability, with an average grain size of 9.8 nm, saturation induction of 1.73 T, coercivity of 14.7 A.m(-1) and saturation magnetostriction of 14 ppm, in comparison with LFA. To ensure precise average grain size, both XRD data and TEM micrographs were separately considered. Even though saturation magnetostriction could not be completely eliminated, it was significantly minimized from 52 ppm to 35 ppm, 14 ppm and 6 ppm in the samples subjected to AA, VA and LFA, respectively.

AB (Zr47Cu44Al9)(100-x)Nb-x (x = 0, 1, 2, 3, and 5 at.%) bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) were prepared by copper mould casting. The influence of Nb addition on glass-forming ability (GFA), thermal stability and mechanical properties of ZrCuAl alloys was studied. The GFA of Zr47Cu44Al9 BMGs is enhanced obviously after the addition of Nb. The critical size of completely amorphous sample increases from 4 mm for Zr47Cu44Al9 to 10 mm for (Zr47Cu44Al9)(98)Nb-2 alloy. The average activation energy of crystallization is 505 kJ/mol for (Zr47Cu44Al9)(98)Nb-2 BMG, which is larger than that of Zr47Cu44Al9 BMG with 443 kJ/mol. The fracture strength and plasticity are sensitive to the Nb content. (Zr47Cu44Al9)(98)Nb-2 BMG exhibits high fracture strength of 2397 MPa and prominent plastic strain of 13.2%, and multiple shear bands with high density were observed. Furthermore, the possible mechanisms involved in obtaining high GFA and large plasticity were explored.

AB Molecular dynamic simulations have been carried out to investigate the crystallization mechanism during rapid cooling and isothermal relaxation for Zirconium (Zr) under a pressure of 100 GPa. The properties of the simulated system are analysed in terms of the system energy, the pair distribution function (PDF), and the largest standard cluster analysis. It is found that the so called topologically close-packed (TCP) local structures dominate in number in liquid, supercooled liquid and the final solid. Both solidification and relaxation crystallize into an A15 phase rather than the simple bcc or hcp crystals, the metastable and stable crystal of Zr under the ambient condition. Interestingly on PDF curves for liquids and super-liquids, left to the first major peak (at around r = 3.0 angstrom) there is a mini-peak (at around r = 1.87 angstrom) that decreases with the decrease of temperature and vanishes when crystallization ends. Further analysis reveals that the mini-peak originates from dynamical compact atomic pairs that are however almost nothing to do with TCP local structures. In addition, the multi characteristic lengths of the A15 unit (composed of Z12 and Z14 local structures with ratio of 1:3) result in the distinct split of the first and second peaks on the PDF curves.

AB Chalcogenide arsenic sulphide thin films were obtained by reacting arsenic and sulfur vapors in a low-temperature plasma discharge. Photoluminescence (PL) of As-S films with compositions As34S66 and As53S47 is studied in detail. An increase in the arsenic concentration leads to the emergence of a crystalline phase in the As53S47 films. In addition, these films exhibit an intense broad PL band with a maximum at 2.2 eV upon a continuous 473 nm laser excitation. The interplay between composition, structure and optical properties is revealed. By coupling of PL, Raman spectroscopy and absorption data, possible mechanisms of radiative recombination in the context of the glass structure formation in the plasma discharge are discussed.

AB In the present work, a series of Dy3+ ion doped tellurite glasses in the (50-x)TeO2-25WO(3)-25Li(2)O-xDy(2)O(3) system were synthesized using conventional melt quenching technique to investigate colorimetric and radiative properties of Dy3+ ions in a new and stable host for their evaluation as solid-state lighting materials. Physical and structural properties were studied through density calculations, refractive index measurements, and Fourier transform IR spectroscopy analysis. Thermal properties of glasses -glass transition (T-g) and crystallization (T-c/T-p) temperatures and temperature difference (Delta T) - were determined using differential scanning calorimetry. Optical absorption spectra of glasses were recorded with Vis-NIR spectrophotometer. CIE color coordinates, correlated color temperature, color rendering index and yellow to blue emission intensity ratio values were obtained through photoluminescence analysis. Radiative properties such as, radiative transition probability, stimulated emission cross-section, branching ratio and optical bandwidth gain were calculated according to Judd-Ofelt theory. The obtained optical spectroscopy results were found to be comparable or better than other reported glass systems. From the derived results, glasses with Dy3+ ion concentration lower than 0.5 mol% were found to show the closest CIE color coordinate values to pure white light and highest CCT and CRI values revealing good potentiality to be used for applications in white LEDs and solid-state lasers.

AB Using a reliable ab initio molecular dynamics method, we investigate the rapid solidification of the zircon melt. Accompanied by amorphization, a drastic volume expansion of 27% is perceived. This value is fairly larger than 18% observed in the metamict zircon. Such a large volume swelling leads to a significant decrease in the mean coordination number of Zr atoms, which is about 5.66 and the lowest one reported so far. On the other hand, the volume expansion is found to have almost no impact on the average coordination number of Si atoms i.e., they maintain their tetragonal coordination. As suggested by earlier investigations, the polymerization of SiO4 units is witnessed but our model shows the highest polymerization with respect to the previous simulations. Based on our findings, we propose that our model does not represent the metamict zircon but a very low density amorphous phase of zircon.

AB In this paper, an iron-rich CaO-MgO-Al2O3-SiO2 glass-ceramic was prepared basing high iron chromium slag. We employ DSC, XRD and SEM validated the thermal behavior and the microstructure of the glass/glass-ceramics, and reveal a mechanism of the dual effect of high Fe2O3 addition on the crystallization. Here we show that Fe2O3 facilitates the formation of spinel, but inhibits the precipitation of pyroxene. Infrared spectroscopy analysis shows that its promotion to the precipitation of spinel is attributed to the depolymerization of the glass network. Scanning electron microscope observation shows that the inhibition to the crystallization of pyroxene due to the region where nucleation dose not occurs. The increase of Fe2O3 addition enlarges the volume ratio of the non nucleated region in the microstructure, and increases the crystallization activation energy of the pyroxene. In addition, we find that the crystallinity of the glass-ceramics decreased with the increase of Fe2O3 addition, but the average size of the pyroxene grains reduced from 116 +/- 4 nm to 84 +/- 3 nm. We also show that the distribution of chromium in glass-ceramics was largely influenced by Fe2O3 addition. This study is particularly instructive for controlling the crystallization of the iron-rich CMAS glass-ceramics, and provides some insight for solidifying chromium in high iron waste slag.

AB Zinc Bismuth Strontium Borosilicate (ZnBiSrBSi) glasses doped with varying concentrations of samarium (Sm3+) ions have been synthesized via melt quenching technique and characterized by using XRD, SEM, optical absorption, excitation, Photoluminescence (PL) and decay spectral measurements. The amorphous nature of the as prepared glass has been confirmed by XRD and SEM measurements. The PL spectra recorded for the as-prepared glasses under 403 nm excitation show four emission bands from (4)G(5/2) level to H-6(J) (J = 5/2, 7/2, 9/2 and 11/2). Among the four emission transitions, (4)G(5/2) -> H-6(7/2) transition at 600 nm is having highest intensity. The intensity of PL spectra in the titled glasses increases with increase in Sm3+ ions concentration up to 0.5 mol% and beyond decreases due to concentration quenching. Dexter theory applied to the emission spectral features reveals the energy transfer mechanism between Sm3+-Sm3+ ions as dipole-dipole in nature. The experimental lifetimes measured from the PL decay profiles for the intense (4)G(5/2) -> H-6(7/2) transition decreases with increase in Sm3+ ions concentration due to energy transfer between Sm3+-Sm3+ ions. All the aforementioned studies finally reveal that 0.5 mol% of Sm3+ ions in ZnBiSrBSi glasses is optimum in fabricating the reddish orange luminescent devices.

AB Heavy metal oxide glasses of composition (50 - x) PbO - 10 WO3-10 Na2O - 10 MgO - (20 + x) B2O3 (where x = 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20 mol%) have been fabricated using melt quenching technique. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra confirm the amorphous nature of the glasses. The Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) throws the light on the various structural properties of the glasses. UV - Visible spectra has been recorded in the range 190-1100 nm. The direct and indirect band gap energies increase from 2.695-2.805 eV and 3.126-3.237 eV as percentage of lead decreases. This value of indirect band gap is further used to calculate the other optical parameters such as refractive index, dielectric constant, optical dielectric constant, reflection loss, molar refractivity, metallization and molar polarizability. Besides, the mass attenuation coefficients have been obtained in the energy range of 0.01-10 MeV using MCNPX code and XCOM program. The obtained results are found to be in agreement. These values are further used to calculate the effective atomic numbers and half value layers of the present glasses. All the shielding parameters are found to depend on the chemical composition and energy of the gamma radiations. But the PB50B20 glass sample is found to possess the highest effective atomic number and the lowest value half value layer. The PB50B20 glass sample (contains 50 mol% PbO) owns the best gamma shielding characteristics.

AB Yttrium alumino bismuth borosilicate (YABiBS) glasses doped with RE3+ ions (Eu3+, Dy3+, Dy3+ - Eu3+) have been synthesized via standard melt quenching technique and their emission properties were investigated. Optical analysis of these glasses is characterized by absorption and luminescence. XRD spectra reveal that these glasses have amorphous nature. The absorption spectra of these co-doped glasses consist five bands of Dy3+ which are assigned to H-6(15/2) -> F-6(3/2) (750 nm), F-6(5/2) (796 nm), F-6(9/2) (1085 nm), F-6(11/2) (1264 nm), H-6(11/2) (1677 nm) and another four bands of Eu3+ assigned to F-7(0)-> L-5(6) (393 nm) Meza-Rocha et al. (2017) [5], D-5(2) (464 nm), F-7(6) (2097 nm), and F-7(1) -> F-7(6) (2202 nm). It is also witnessed a broad band having electronic transition S-1(0) -> P-1(1) is due to Bi3+ ions. Optical band gaps, nephelauxetic ratio, and bonding parameters are discussed by using optical absorption data. Eu3+ single doped glasses show five emission bands, with the n-UV excitation wavelength 393 nm, in which characteristic feature red emission (612 nm) is recognized with transition (Meza-Rocha et al., 2017 [5]) D-0 -> F-7(2). At the same time, Dy3+ single doped glasses illuminated with the excitation wavelength of 385 nm shows their known natural emissions blue (481 nm) and yellow (574 nm), having transitions F-4(9/2) -> H-6(15/2) and F-4(9/2) (->) H-6(13/2) respectively. Emission for co-doped glasses Dy3+-Eu3+ are excited with the different selected ultraviolet wavelengths such as 464 nm, 392 nm, 385 nm, 363 nm, and 348 nm. It can be observed that tunable emission from both the ions (Dy3+, Eu3+) from orange reddish emission to white emission. The energy transfer from Dy3+ to Eu3+ is manifested by the quadrupole-quadrupole mechanism, which is confirmed by Inokuti-Hirayama (I-H) modal based on lifetime decay curves. Also, the efficiencies and probabilities of energy transfer are determined based on the results of decay curves. The CIE color coordinates of DE1.0 glass with the excitation 348 nm gives x, y coordinates as (0.332, 0.342) which confers the good white emission. CCT value for this glass is around 5520 K shows that useful for cool WLED applications.

AB Despite its chemical simplicity, a definitive description of the structure of TeO2 glass has remained elusive due to the complexity of the Te-O coordination environment. In this work we probe the Te-O coordination environment in glassy TeO2 using 2D Te-125 isotropic-anisotropic chemical shift correlation nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The NMR results are consistent with the presence of two Te-O environments in this glass, characterized by their distinct set of Te-125 chemical shift parameters. The dominant environment (-89%) is a distorted trigonal bipyramidal TeO4 unit, reminiscent of that observed in crystalline gamma-TeO2. A second, minor (similar to 11%) component can be assigned, on the basis of its chemical shift parameters, to a TeO3 unit. The resulting average coordination number, n(TeO), measured by Te-125 NMR (n(TeO) approximate to 3.9) is higher than its previously reported value obtained using neutron diffraction (nTeO approximate to 3.7).

AB Noncoding RNA (ncRNA) has a key role in regulating gene expression, mediating fundamental processes and diseases via a variety of yet unknown mechanisms. Here, we review recent applications of conventional and enhanced Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations methods to address the mechanistic function of large biomolecular systems that are tightly involved in the ncRNA function and that are of key importance in life sciences. This compendium focuses of three biomolecular systems, namely the CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing machinery, group II intron ribozyme and the ribonucleoprotein complex of the spliceosome, which edit and process ncRNA. We show how the application of a novel accelerated MD simulations method has been key in disclosing the conformational transitions underlying RNA binding in the CRISPR-Cas9 complex, suggesting a mechanism for RNA recruitment and clarifying the conformational changes required for attaining genome editing. As well, we discuss the use of mixed quantum-classical MD simulations in deciphering the catalytic mechanism of RNA splicing as operated by group II intron ribozyme, one of the largest ncRNA structures crystallized so far. Finally, we debate the future challenges and opportunities in the field, discussing the recent application of MD simulations for unraveling the functional biophysics of the spliceosome, a multi-mega Dalton complex of proteins and small nuclear RNAs that performs RNA splicing in humans. This showcase of applications highlights the current talent of MD simulations to dissect atomic-level details of complex biomolecular systems instrumental for the design of finely engineered genome editing machines. As well, this review aims at inspiring future investigations of several other ncRNA regulatory systems, such as micro and small interfering RNAs, which achieve their function and specificity using RNA-based recognition and targeting strategies.

AB Subtilisin-like proteases play crucial roles in host-pathogen interactions. Thus, protease inhibitors constitute important tools in the regulation of this interaction. CmPI-II is a Kazal proteinase inhibitor isolated from Cenchritis muricatus that inhibits subtilisin A, trypsin and elastases. Based on sequence analysis it defines a new group of non-classical Kazal inhibitors. Lacking solved 3D structures from this group prevents the straightforward structural comparison with other Kazal inhibitors. The 3D structure of CmPI-II, solved in this work using NMR techniques, shows the typical fold of Kazal inhibitors, but has significant differences in its N-terminal moiety, the disposition of the CysI-CysV disulfide bond and the reactive site loop (RSL) conformation. The high flexibility of its N-terminal region, the RSL, and the alpha-helix observed in NMR experiments and molecular dynamics simulations, suggest a coupled motion of these regions that could explain CmPI-II broad specificity. The 3D structure of the CmPI-II/subtilisin A complex, obtained by modeling, allows understanding of the energetic basis of the subtilisin A inhibition. The residues at the P2 and P2' positions of the inhibitor RSL were predicted to be major contributors to the binding free energy of the complex, rather than those at the P1 position. Site directed mutagenesis experiments confirmed the Trp14 (P2') contribution to CmPI-II/subtilisin A complex formation. Overall, this work provides the structural determinants for the subtilisin A inhibition by CmPI-II and allows the designing of more specific and potent molecules. In addition, the 3D structure obtained supports the existence of a new group in non-classical Kazal inhibitors.

TI Structure of intermediate filament assembly in hair deduced from

AB Intermediate filaments (IFs) are ubiquitous in biological structures including hair. Small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) data from hydrated samples were used in this study to investigate the distribution of water in hair, and model the structure of the IF assembly. A main diffraction peak at a d-spacing of similar to 90 angstrom, and two weaker reflections show that IFs are arranged in a similar to 105 angstrom quasi-hexagonal lattice. Changes in the diffraction peaks show that only a small fraction of the water absorbed by hair enters between the IFs, and little water diffuses into the core of the IFs. The amount of water in the IF assembly increases rapidly up to 10% relative humidity (RH), and then slowly with further increase in RH. Most of the water appears to reside outside the IF assembly, in the voids and at the interfaces, and contribute to the central diffuse scattering. The IF assembly in the decuticled hair absorbs more water and is more ordered than that the native hair. This suggests that cuticle acts as a barrier, and might constrain the structure by compressing the cortex radially. Treatments with oils that are hydrophobic, heat treatment, and reduction of the S-S linkages that opens up the matrix by disulfide bond cleavage, all affect structure and water permeability. Coconut oil was found to impede hydration more than the soybean oil because of its ability to penetrate deeper into hair. A new model for the IF assembly that is sterically more favorable than the previous models is proposed.

AB Polyglutamine tract-binding protein-1 (PQBP-1) is a nuclear intrinsically disordered protein playing important roles in transcriptional regulation and RNA splicing during embryonic and postembryonic development. In human, its mutations lead to severe cognitive impairment known as the Renpenning syndrome, a form of X-linked intellectual disability (XLID). Here, we report a combined biophysical study of two PQBP-1 frameshift mutants, K192S(fS*7) and R153S(fs*41). Both mutants are dimeric in solution, in contrast to the monomeric wild-type protein. These mutants contain more folded contents and have increased thermal stabilities. Using small-angle X-ray scattering data, we generated three-dimensional envelopes which revealed their overall flat shapes. We also described each mutant using an ensemble model based on a native-like initial pool with a dimeric structural core. PQBP-1 is known to repress transcription by way of interacting with the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, which consists of 52 repeats of a consensus heptapeptide sequence YSPTSPS. We studied the binding of PQBP-1 variants to the labelled peptide which is phosphorylated at positions 2 and 5 (YpSPTpSPS) and found that this interaction is significantly weakened in the two mutants.

AB Mononuclear macrophages are important immune cells in the organisms. The complicated membrane structure underlying the diverse functions of mononuclear-macrophage has been largely unresolved. As a representative of monocyte-derived macrophages, the membrane structure of PMA differentiated THP-1 cells was comprehensively investigated by AFM-based single molecule approaches. The rugged ectoplasmic side of mononuclear-macrophage membrane are significantly different from erythrocytes and mammalian somatic cell membranes. But the smooth lipid bilayer and the branched lipid raft domains obtained by proteinase K and M beta CD treatment of the protein-covered cytoplasmic side, are common characteristics among all the studied cell membranes. This discovery of distinct organization of membrane proteins on both sides of mononuclear-macrophage membranes provides additional evidence for the asymmetry of membrane structure. The podosome-associated structures of mononuclear-macrophage were directly examined, and the independent localization of podosome domains and the lipid rafts was verified by in situ AFM, giving new insight into this multifunctional organelle.

AB 3-Deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate synthase (DAHPS) is responsible for the biosynthesis of essential aromatic compounds in microorganisms and plants. It plays a crucial role in the regulation of the carbon flow into the shikimate pathway. Until now, the crystal structures and regulatory mechanisms of dimeric DAHPS enzymes from type I alpha subclass have not been reported. Here, we reported dimeric structures of the tyrosine-regulated DAHPS from Escherichia call, both in its apo form and complex with the inhibitor tyrosine at 2.5 and 2.0 angstrom resolutions, respectively. DAHPS(Tyr) has a typical (beta/alpha)(8) TIM barrel, which is decorated with an N-terminal extension and an antiparallel beta sheet, beta 6a/beta 6b. Inhibitor tyrosine binds at a cavity formed by residues of helices alpha 3, alpha 4, strands beta 6a, beta 6b and the adjacent loops, and directly interacts with residues P148, Q152, S181, 1213 and N8*. Although the small angle X-ray scattering profiles from DAHPS(Tyr) with and without tyrosine shows that tyrosine binding leaves most of DAHPS(Tyr) structures unaffected. The comparison of the liganded and unliganded crystal structures reveals that conformational changes of residues P148, Q152 and 1213 initiate a transmission pathway to propagate the allosteric signal from the tyrosine-binding site to the active site, which is different from DAHPS(Phe), a phenylalanine-regulated isozyme from E. coli. In addition, mutations of five tyrosine-binding residues P148, Q152, S181, 1213 and N8* leads to tyrosine-resistant DAHPS(Tyr) enzymes. These findings provide a new insight into the regulatory mechanism of DAHPS enzymes and a basis for further engineering studies.

AB Glucuronoxylan-beta-1,4-xylanohydrolase from Clostridiwn thermocellum (CtXynGH30) hydrolyzes beta-1,4-xylosidic linkages in 4-O-Methyl-D-glucuronoxylan. CtXynGH30 comprises an N-terminal catalytic domain, CtXyn30A, joined by a typical linker sequence to a family 6 carbohydrate-binding module, termed CtCBM6. ITC, mass spectrometric and enzyme activity analyses of CtXyn30A:CtCBM6 (1:1 M ratio), CtXyn30A and CtXynGH30 showed that the linker peptide plays a key role in connecting and orienting CtXyn30A and CtCBM6 modules resulting in the enhanced activity of CtXynGH30. To visualize the disposition of the two protein domains of CtXynGH30, SAXS analysis revealed that CtXynGH30 is monomeric and has a boot-shaped molecular envelope in solution with a D-max of 18 run and Rg of 3.6 nm. Kratky plot displayed the protein in a fully folded and flexible state. The ab initio derived dummy atom model of CtXynGH30 superposed well with the modelled structure.

AB Macrofibrils, the main structural features within the cortical cells of mammalian hair shafts, are long composite bundles of keratin intermediate filaments (KIFs) embedded in a matrix of keratin-associated proteins. The KIFs can be helically arranged around the macrofibril central axis, making a cylinder within which KIF helical angle relative to macrofibril axis increases approximately linearly from macrofibril centre to edge. Mesophase-based self-assembly has been implicated in the early formation of macrofibrils, which first appear as liquid-crystal tactoids in the bulb of hair follicles. Formation appears to be driven initially by interactions between pre-keratinized KIFs. Differences in the nature of these KIF-KIF interactions could result in all macrofibrils being internally twisted in a single handedness, or a 50:50 mixture of handedness within each cortical cell. We data mined 41 electron tomograms containing three-dimensional macrofibril data from previously published studies of hair and wool. In all 644 macrofibrils examined we found that within each tomogram all macrofibrils had the same handedness. We concluded that earlier reports of left- and right-handed macrofibrils were due to artefacts of imaging or data processing. A handedness marker was used to confirm (using re-imaged sections from earlier studies) that, in both human and sheep, all macrofibrils are left-handed around the macrofibril axis. We conclude that this state is universal within mammalian hair. This also supports the conclusion that the origin of macrofibril twist is the expression of chiral twisting forces between adjacent KIFs, rather than mesophase splay and bending forces relaxing to twisting forces acting within a confined space.

AB Membrane bound O-acyltransferase domain- containing 7 (MBOAT7, also known as LPIAT1) is a protein involved in the acyl chain remodeling of phospholipids via the Lands' cycle. The MBOAT7 is a susceptibility risk genetic locus for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and mental retardation. Although it has been shown that MBOAT7 is associated to membranes, the MBOAT7 topology remains unknown. To solve the topological organization of MBOAT7, we performed: A) solubilization of the total membrane fraction of cells overexpressing the recombinant MBOAT7-V5, which revealed MBOAT7 is an integral protein strongly attached to endomembranes; B) in silico analysis by using 22 computational methods, which predicted the number and localization of transmembrane domains of MBOAT7 with a range between 5 and 12; C) in vitro analysis of living cells transfected with GFP-tagged MBOAT7 full length and truncated forms, using a combination of Western Blotting, co-immunofluorescence and Fluorescence Protease Protection (FPP) assay; D) in vitro analysis of living cells transfected with FLAG-tagged MBOAT7 full length forms, using a combination of Western Blotting, selective membrane permeabilization followed by indirect immunofluorescence. All together, these data revealed that MBOAT7 is a multispanning transmembrane protein with six transmembrane domains. Based on our model, the predicted catalytic dyad of the protein, composed of the conserved asparagine in position 321 (Asn-321) and the preserved histidine in position 356 (His-356), has a lumenal localization. These data are compatible with the role of MBOAT7 in remodeling the acyl chain composition of endomembranes.

AB Scorpion envenomation has been considered a public health issue around the world. Tityus serrulatus represents a specie of major medical importance in Brazil due to mortality rates of approximately 1% among children and elderly populations. The aim of this work was to evaluate the in vivo anti-inflammatory potential of aqueous extract from Hancornia speciosa fruits, its fractions and its phenolic compounds against T. serrulatus envenomation. After receiving the T. serrulatus venom (TsV, 0.8 mg/kg) intraperitoneally, the animals were treated intravenously with the aqueous extract (20, 30 and 40 mg/kg), the arachnid antivenom (50 mu L/animal), the dichloromethane, ethyl acetate and n-butanol fractions (20 mg/kg) as well as rutin and chlorogenic acid (2, 2.5 and 5 mg/kg). The treatment with the aqueous extract, fractions and phenolic compounds decreased the migration of leukocytes to the peritoneal cavity and reduced the levels of IL-1 beta, IL-6 and IL-12. Moreover, the pulmonary histopathologic analysis showed a reduction in both interstitial and alveolar edema, as well as in the leukocytes infiltration and vascular ectasia in the mice's lungs, which evidences a protective effect attributed to H. speciosa. This is the first study that demonstrates the inhibitory potential of the aqueous extract from H. speciosa fruits against inflammation induced by TsV. These findings suggest that the bioactive compounds from the aqueous extract, especially chlorogenic acid and rutin, are responsible for the reported anti-inflammatory activity of H. speciosa.

AB Aflatoxins are widely occurring food contaminants that are particularly harmful to dairy products and cows. The plant polyphenol resveratrol has been reported to have a good effect on increasing the resistance of cells toward toxins. Therefore, we measured the effects of aflatoxin B1 and resveratrol on the viability of the MAC-T cow mammary epithelial cell line. The appropriate treatment concentrations were assayed (12.81 mu M aflatoxin B1 and 43.81 mu M resveratrol) to verify the protective effect of resveratrol toward mammary epithelial cells. The results showed that resveratrol alleviates aflatoxin B1-induced cytotoxicity, including the increase in ROS and the decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and apoptosis in MAC-T cells. The expression of mRNA transcripts (including Nrf2, Keap1, NQO1, HO-1, SOD2 and HSP70) for components of the Nrf2 signaling pathway was evaluated by real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR, with resveratrol also exhibiting a good regulatory effect. Thus, resveratrol was shown to have an ameliorating effect on aflatoxin toxicity in MAC-T cells.

DE Persea americana; Poisoning; Rabbits; Cardiomyopathy
ID PERSEA-AMERICANA; AQUEOUS EXTRACT; LEAVES; BIM
AB The aim of this paper was to report an outbreak of avocado poisoning in rabbits in Salta, Argentina. Fourteen rabbits died of congestive heart failure within 30 h of ingesting fresh avocado leaves from pruned trees. They showed clinical signs of respiratory and cardiac distress. Full necropsies of four rabbits were performed and samples were collected for histopathology. The gross pathological observation included pleural and pericardial effusion, pulmonary oedema, slight ascites; the hearts appeared flabby and markedly pale. In addition, the stomach content consisted mostly of green feed with large amounts of avocado leaves. Epidermal fragments of Persea americana were identified by microhistological analysis of gastric content to get most efficiently to a correct diagnosis. Histopathological examination revealed degeneration and necrosis of myocytes and a mononuclear cellular infiltration mainly involving the myocardium and, to a lesser extent, the liver, lung and kidneys. Our observations indicate that avocado leaves should be avoided in the green diet of rabbits.

AB Intoxication by Moraea pallida Bak. (yellow tulp) in livestock is of great importance in South Africa, ranking top among all plant-induced cardiac glycoside toxicosis. The toxic principle, a bufadienolide, is 1 alpha, 2 alpha-epoxyscillirosidine. Treatment of poisoning is challenging and affected livestock often succumbs due to the stress of handling. Manipulating animals to resist poisoning is a potential management strategy. The goal of this study was to explore the potential to develop a vaccine against epoxyscillirosidine by raising antibodies against epoxyscillirosidine in sheep and to assess the neutralization ability of the antibodies in vitro. Epoxyscillirosidine was successfully conjugated to keyhole limpet haemocyanin (KLH) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) rendering them immunogenic. The sheep, vaccinated with epoxyscillirosidine-KLH conjugate (n = 4) and KLH (n = 2) with Montanide, developed antibodies as determined with an indirect enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Total immunoglobulins from sera of vaccinated and control sheep that were purified and concentrated using ammonium sulphate precipitation were 11,940 and 7850 mu g, respectively. The in vitro neutralization assay using the methyl blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT) cell viability assay indicated no significant difference (p > 0.05) between anti-epoxyscillirosidine-KLH and KLH antibodies. Rather, the antibodies seemed to enhance the cytotoxicity of epoxyscillirosidine in H9c2 cells. Thus, it is necessary to develop improved vaccination methods to generate antibodies capable of neutralizing the functional group responsible for epoxyscillirosidine toxicity.

ID RESPONSES
AB Objetive: To evaluate Neosaxitoxin (NeoSTX) as a local anesthetic drug, for pain control during and after piglet castration.
   Study design: Prospective, randomized and double-blind study.
   Animals: 24 commercial hybrids, males, 23-day-old piglets.
   Methods: The piglets were randomized into two groups: a Lidocaine group and a NeoSTX group. One minute before castration, they were injected intra-scrotally with a single dose of Lidocaine (20 mg, in 1 mL) and NeoSTX (0.1 mu g, in 1 mL), respectively.
   Results: NeoSTX does not generate vasoconstriction or scrotal contraction, unlike Lidocaine, where a decrease in temperature and scrotal size is observed within 5 min after the procedure. After 24 h, wound inflammation, as measured by scrotal size, was lower in the NeoSTX group. No significant difference could be shown between the vocalizations and facial expressions of pain of both groups during the castration procedure.
   Conclusions: A single dose of NeoSTX is safe and effective for pain management during and after piglet castration. NeoSTX treated piglets were less affected by castration than those in the Lidocaine group, thus reducing piglet stress and enhancing the quality of piglet convalescence.

AB Naja kaouthia is one of the most prevalent medically important snakes of North East India and Bangladesh responsible for most of the bite cases. In this study, an attempt was made to decipher venom variation of Naja kaouthia venom from North East India and Bangladesh. Using multidimensional methods including reverse phase HPLC, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (1D-PAGE) and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE), the quantitative differences in venom composition have been revealed. Moreover, tested in vitro biochemical and biological activities also exhibited differences which could be due to venom variability. Furthermore, neutralization efficacy of commercially available Indian polyvalent antivenoms (Vim, Bharat Serum, Haffkine) was evaluated and the results displayed significant differences in neutralizing efficacy between the antivenoms. Immunoblotting experiments showed antivenom molecules cross reacted with high molecular mass components while poorly reacted towards low molecular mass proteins. Immuno-depletion study demonstrated that Vins polyvalent antivenom was poor in immunocapturing the venom proteins of both North East Indian and Bangladesh origin Naja kaouthia at the ratio of 1:16 (venom: antivenom).

AB Compounds similar to maitotoxin (MTX) have been isolated from several laboratory strains of the dinoflagellate Gambierdiscus spp. from the Caribbean. Mass spectral results suggest that these compounds differ from MTX by the loss of one sulfate group and, in some cases, the loss of one methyl group with the addition of one degree of unsaturation. NMR experiments, using approximately 50 nmol of one of these compounds, have demonstrated that the 9-sulfo group of MTX is still present, suggesting that these compounds are 40-desulfo congeners of MTX.

TI Venom composition of adult Western Diamondback Rattlesnakes (Crotalus
   atrox) maintained under controlled diet and environmental conditions
   shows only minor changes

AB Many species of snakes produce venom as a chemical means of procuring potentially fractious prey. Studies have increasingly focused on venom compositional variation between and within individual snakes of the same species/subspecies, with significant differences often being observed. This variation in composition has been attributed to differences in age, season, diet, and environment, suggesting that these factors could help explain the inter- and intra-specific variation found in some snake venoms, perhaps via some type of feedback mechanism(s). To address several of these possible sources of variation, this study utilized wild-caught Western Diamondback Rattlesnakes (Crotalus atrox) from Cochise Co., AZ. Sixteen adult C. atrox were maintained in the lab on a diet of NSA mice for eight months to determine whether venom composition changed in captivity under a static diet in a stable environment. Reducing 1-D SDS-PAGE, fibrinogen degradation assays, reversed-phase HPLC, and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry revealed only minor differences over time within individuals. Venom L-amino acid oxidase (LAAO) and phosphodiesterase activities significantly increased over the course of captivity, with no changes occurring in azocasein metalloproteinase, kallikrein-like serine proteinase (KLSP), or thrombin-like serine proteinase (TLSP) activities. Snake total length was positively correlated with TLSP activity and negatively correlated with LAAO and KLSP activity. There was typically a much higher degree of variation between individuals than within individuals for all analyses performed and measurements collected. Because the overall "fingerprint" of each snakes venom remained more/less constant, it is concluded that biologically significant changes in venom composition did not occur within individual C. atrox as a function of captivity/diet. However, this study does indicate that differences in activity levels do occur in minor venom enzyme components, but the differences observed are likely to be of minimal significance to the production of antivenom or to subsequent treatment of human envenomations.

AB Variability in the composition of snake venoms occurs in different taxa and is usually correlated to snake fitness. Here, we compared B. atrox venoms from three different geographic regions across the Brazilian Amazon and found remarkable functional differences particularly between venoms from two populations separated by the Amazon River, in specimens born, raised and maintained under the same conditions at Institute Butantan serpentary. Venom from Presidente Figueiredo snakes induced stronger dermonecrosis, but was less procoagulant and lethal to mice; these activities were correlated to the presence of a PI-class SVMP and absence of a SVSP in the venom, respectively. Venom from Sao Bento snakes was more hemorrhagic, killed mice more efficiently, but induced lower signs of dermonecrosis, which was correlated to the higher proportion of SVMPs and the absence of a PI-class SVMP isoform. Belterra snakes, a reference of wild snakes, presented venoms with intermediate phenotypes. Commercial Bothrops antivenom was effective in neutralizing all biological activities evaluated in this study, including dermonecrosis and pro-coagulant, which are relevant for human snakebite accidents by B. atrox. Functional differences correlated to snake fitness may also imply in different symptomatology for B. atrox snakebite patients and deserve special attention from clinical toxicologists.

AB Most colubrid snake venoms have been poorly studied, despite the fact that they represent a great resource for biological, ecological, toxinological and pharmacological research. Herein, we explore the venom delivery system of the Aesculapian False Coral Snake Erythrolamprus aesculapii as well as some biochemical and toxicological properties of its venom. Its Duvernoy's venom gland is composed of serous secretory cells arranged in densely packed secretory tubules, and the most striking feature of its fang is their double-curved shape, exhibiting a beveled bladelike appearance near the tips. Although E. aesculapii resembles elapid snakes of the genus Micrurus in color pattern, this species produces a venom reminiscent of viperid venoms, containing mainly tissue damaging toxins such as proteinases. Prominent hemorrhage developed both locally and systemically in mice injected with the venom, and the minimum hemorrhagic dose was found to be 18.8 mu g/mouse; the lethal dose, determined in mice, was 9.5 +/- 3.7 mu g/g body weight. This work has toxicological implications that bites to humans by E. aesculapii could result in moderately severe local (and perhaps systemic) hemorrhage and gives insight into future directions for research on the venom of this species.

AB Conventional drug delivery systems have many limitations including cytotoxicity and affecting non-specific cells. Cell-targeting peptides (CTPs) as a potential class of targeting moiety have some advantages over previous targeting moieties such as monoclonal antibodies, offer additional benefits to design systems using CTPs. Here we have engineered listeriolysin O (LLO) pore-forming toxin by adding a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) targeting peptide to its N-terminus. Two versions of the toxin, with and without targeting peptide, were sub-cloned into a bacterial expression plasmid. BL21 DE3 cells were used for induction of expression and recombinant proteins were purified using nickel-immobilized metal affinity chromatography column. In order to treat MDA-MB-231 and SKOV3 cell lines as LHRH receptor positive and negative cells, two mentioned LLO toxins were used to evaluate their cytotoxicity and specificity. Our results reveal that the IC50 of LLO toxin on MDA-MB-231 and SKOV3 cells was 0.32 and 0.41 mu g/ml respectively. Furthermore, IC50 of fusion LHRH-LLO toxin on the cells was 0.88 and 19.55 mu g/ml. Cytotoxicity of engineered LHRH-LLO toxin on negative cells was significantly 48-fold lower than wild-type LLO toxin. But this difference has been lowered to only 2.7-fold less cytotoxicity in positive cells. To the best of our knowledge, the current work as the first study regarding engineered toxin revealed that CDC family members could be used to target the specific cell-type.

AB Objectives: To describe the clinical features and outcomes in elderly patients with sarcoidosis and to compare them with younger patients.
   Material and methods: Retrospective study of a large cohort of 668 consecutive patients with sarcoidosis prospectively collected during 42 years at the Bellvitge University Hospital, a tertiary care single-centre in Barcelona, Spain. Elderly sarcoidosis was defined as sarcoidosis diagnosed in patients >= 65 years-old.
   Results: Elderly sarcoidosis was diagnosed in 47 (7%) patients. In younger patients, Lofgren's syndrome was the predominant mode of onset (8.5% vs. 42.2%, p < 0.001). At diagnosis, elderly patients more frequently demonstrated radiographic stage III and IV sarcoidosis (21.3% vs. 7.6%, p= 0.001), isolated extrapulmonary involvement (21.3% vs. 8.2%, p= 0.003), subcutaneous nodules (17% vs. 3.4%, p < 0.001) and intraabdominal/ retroperitoneal lymph nodes (23.4% vs. 9.5%, p= 0.003). Furthermore, patients with elderly sarcoidosis achieved remission (spontaneous and under treatment) less frequently during the follow-up period (14 patients, 35% vs. 305 patients, 53%, p= 0.027) and had a higher incidence of pulmonary fibrosis (15% vs. 6.1%, p= 0.029). Death related to sarcoidosis was more prevalent in elderly patients (6.4% vs. 1.3%, p= 0.036).
   Conclusions: Sarcoidosis in elderly patients requires a high index of suspicion. Aged pulmonary sarcoidosis patients presented with more severe disease at presentation and worse outcomes compared to younger patients. Isolated extrapulmonary involvement at diagnosis and certain particular extrapulmonary organ involvement were more frequent in elderly sarcoidosis. Remission was less frequent in elderly sarcoidosis.

DE Sarcoidosis; Economic burden; Health costs; Socioeconomic consequences;

ID BURDEN; RISK
AB Background: Sarcoidosis is a systemic disease that primarily affects the younger population. Longitudinal studies of the economic burden of sarcoidosis are scarce. This study evaluates overall the economic burden of sarcoidosis in Denmark before and after initial diagnosis.
   Methods: We identified patients with sarcoidosis in the Danish National Patient Registry (1998-2010). All controls were randomly selected and matched concerning age, gender and residence. Data on direct and indirect costs, including frequency of primary and secondary sector contacts and procedures, medication, unemployment benefits and social transfer payments were extracted from national databases for patients and controls.
   Results: We identified 9119 patients with sarcoidosis and 36,432 matching controls. Patients with sarcoidosis had significantly higher rates of health-related contacts, higher usage of medication and more received unemployment and social payments compared with controls.
   The total health expenses were significantly higher in the sarcoidosis group 11 years before and 11 years after diagnosis than among controls.
   Income from public transfer payments was significantly higher in the sarcoidosis group five years prior of diagnosis until nine years post diagnosis. Especially women between 40 and 59 years have a lower income than their controls.
   Conclusion: Sarcoidosis has a socioeconomic impact on adults especially during their prime working and providing years and this is evident several years prior to and post diagnosis. The authors advocate that further research should focus on identifying the proportion of patients with sarcoidosis that imposes the largest economic burden. Increased focus on early diagnosis and disease management may reduce the socioeconomic burden of sarcoidosis.

AB Background: Although it is the general consensus that sarcoidosis patients who present with sarcoidosis-related symptoms have a worse outcome than patients whose disease is detected incidentally without symptoms, this premise has not been rigorously examined.
   Methods: Consecutive patients followed longitudinally at one US university sarcoidosis clinic were questioned concerning the onset and description of sarcoidosis-related symptoms at disease presentation. The patients were classified into those with no sarcoidosis-related symptoms at presentation (NSP group) and those with symptoms at presentation (SP group). The following outcomes were examined in the NSP and SP groups: most recent spirometry, organ involvement, need for sarcoidosis therapy, most recent health related quality of life (HRQOL) as measured by the Sarcoidosis Assessment Tool (SAT), most recent chest imaging Scadding stage results.
   Results: 660 sarcoidosis patients were analyzed, with 175 in the NSP group and 485 in the SP group. Compared to the NSP group, the SP group had a more frequent requirement for any sarcoidosis treatment, corticosteroid treatment, and non-corticosteroid treatment at some time and within the most recent year of follow up (at least 50% more than the NP group with strong statistical differences with p values all 0.01 or less). In addition, the SP group had significantly more organ involvement (p < 0.001) and several worse SAT domains (p < 0.022) than the NP group. There were no differences between the groups in terms of final spirometry or development of Scadding stage 4 chest radiographs. These findings held even after adjusting for age, sex, race, and time between presentation and the most recent follow-up visit using a multivariable logistic regression framework.
   Conclusions: In our sarcoidosis cohort, compared to the absence of symptoms at presentation, the presence of symptoms was associated with a greater need for treatment, more organ involvement, and worse HRQOL.

AB Background: Although several contributions exist on the role of fractional exhaled NO (FeNO) in diagnosis and management of asthma, no studies have analysed the association between FeNO in patients with severe asthma and nasal polyposis.
   Aim: We investigated the potential association between FeNO and the presence of nasal polyps in patients affected by severe asthma.
   Methods: Study population included 93 severe asthmatic adult patients consecutively enrolled from four Italian specialist clinic centres from 2015 to 2018. In these patients lung function, asthma control, FeNO, blood eosinophils and CT scan of paranasal sinuses were evaluated.
   Results: Nasal polyposis was observed in 28 patients (30%). Among univariate predictors (lower BMI, higher FeNO, eosinophil and neutrophil count), recursive partitioning analysis identified as best predictors of nasal polyposis high values of eosinophil count (>= 6.5% or> 420 cells/mm(3)) and FeNO (>= 39 ppb). The 40 patients with low eosinophil count and FeNO had a significant lower occurrence of nasal polyposis than those with higher values (8% vs 58%; p < 0.001). The stratification algorithm had a good performance in discriminate patients with and without nasal polyposis (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.768).
   Conclusions: Our results show that FeNO might improve to detect nasal polyposis in patients with severe asthma and a low level of blood eosinophils counts, identifying individuals with high susceptibility to this condition.

AB Introduction: Evidence about the economic burden related to interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) and the cost-driving factors is sparse. In the knowledge that distinct comorbidities affect the clinical course of ILDs, our study investigates their impact on costs of care within first year after diagnosis.
   Methods: Using claims data of individuals diagnosed with Idiopathic Interstitial Pneumonia (IIP) (n= 14 453) or sarcoidosis (n= 9106) between 2010 and 2013, we calculated total and ILD-associated mean annual per capita costs adjusted by age, sex and comorbidity burden via Generalized Linear Gamma models. Then, we assessed the cost impact of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, coronary artery disease, depression, gastro-esophageal reflux disease, pulmonary hypertension (PH), obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) and lung cancer using the model-based parameter estimates.
   Results: Total mean annual per capita costs were (sic)11 131 in the pooled cohort, (sic)12 111 in IIP and (sic)8793 in sarcoidosis, each with a 1/3 share of ILD-associated cost. Most comorbidities had a significant cost-driving effect, which was most pronounced for lung cancer in total (1.989 pooled, 2.491 sarcoidosis, 1.696 IIP) and for PH in ILD-associated costs (2.606 pooled, 2.347 IIP, 3.648 sarcoidosis). The lung-associated comorbidities COPD, PH, OSAS more strongly affected ILD-associated than total costs.
   Conclusion: Comorbidities increase the already substantial costs of care in ILDs. To support patient-centred ILD care, not only highly cost-driving conditions that are inherent with high mortality themselves require systematic management. Moreover, conditions that are more rather restricting the patient's activities of daily living should be addressed-despite a low-cost impact.

AB The aim of this study was to describe the endotracheal respiratory flora in a population of adults suffering from neuromuscular or neurological disorders requiring a long-term tracheostomy and to identify risk factors for colonization. We conducted a prospective and single-center observational study among patients with chronic tracheostomy admitted for planned respiratory assessment between February 2015 and December 2016. Data were collected from patient interview and medical charts with a standardized questionnaire. A tracheal aspiration was performed for each patient. Humidifiers were analysed for bacteriological contamination. Overall 77 tracheal aspirates (TA) were obtained from patients included. Pathogenic bacteria were found in 90% of cases (69/77) with a majority of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (32/77, 41%), Staphylococcus aureus (34/77, 44%) and Serratia marcesens. (22/79, 38%) Amoxicillin + Clavulanic-acid and Cefotaxime were adapted for respectively in only 28% and 35% of the subjects due to the natural resistance of organisms. No pathogenic bacteria were isolated from humidifier samples. Risk factors significantly associated with P. aeruginosa colonization were residence in a medical-care home (p = 0.01, OR = 3.8 [1.1; 15.1]) and the presence of a cuff (p = 0.003, OR = 4.4 [1.1; 20.6]). Significant quantities of pathogenic bacteria are frequently isolated from TA of tracheostomised patients in the absence of infection. The frequent resistance of these pathogens to Amoxicillin + Clavulanic-acid precludes the use of this antibiotic in the empiric treatment of pneumonia in this population.

AB Background: Aclidinium bromide is an inhaled long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA). Although the initial potential increased cardiovascular and mortality risk among users of tiotropium has been ruled out by several observational studies, and clinical trials, there are still concerns related to the use of newer LAMA medications. The current study aimed to evaluate the risk of death among users of aclidinium and other LAMAs.
   Methods: We conducted a cohort and nested case-control study among patients with COPD aged 40 years or older to compare the risk of all-cause mortality among users of aclidinium and other COPD medications with the risk among users of long-acting beta 2 agonists (LABA), in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) in the United Kingdom (2012-2017).
   Results: Mortality rates per 1,000 person-years were 32.9 for aclidinium, 43.8 for tiotropium, 38.0 for other LAMA, 47.1 for LABA/ICS, and 38.1 for LABA. The RR of death compared with current use of LABA was 0.54 (confidence interval [95% CI], 0.40-0.72) for aclidinium, 0.96 (95% CI, 0.76-1.21) for tiotropium, 0.76 (95% CI, 0.58-0.99) for other LAMA, and 1.08 (95% CI, 0.90-1.31) for LABA/ICS. Decreased risk for death observed among users of aclidinium was driven by overall current single use (RR= 0.41; 95% CI, 0.22-0.79), which corresponded to 26% of the aclidinium users (< 15 cases) and not by multiple use (RR= 1.02; 95% CI, 0.71-1.48).
   Conclusion: Use of aclidinium, tiotropium, other LAMA, or LABA/ICS was not associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality as compared with the use of LABAs.

AB Background and purpose: Patients with anti-aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (ARS) antibodies frequently experience complications of interstitial pneumonia (ARS-IP), and the computed tomography (CT) of ARS-IP frequently shows nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) pattern. The CT pattern of ARS-IP might be different from that of idiopathic IP. However, the clinical differences in patients with ARS-IP and idiopathic IP showing the similar CT patterns have not yet been well studied. The objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical differences between patients with ARS-NSIP and idiopathic NSIP (I-NSIP).
   Methods: Two groups of 34 patients each, with ARS-NSIP and I-NSIP, who visited Hiroshima University Hospital between January 2005 and December 2017, were enrolled. Clinical features and outcomes were retrospectively compared between the two groups.
   Results: The ARS-NSIP group included more female patients and significantly younger patients than the I-NSIP group. The percentage of lymphocytes in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was significantly higher, and the CD4/CD8 ratio in BALF was significantly lower in the ARS-NSIP group compared with the I-NSIP group. The proportion of patients with traction bronchiectasis detected by CT was significantly higher in I-NSIP compared with ARS-NSIP. The number of patients who received corticosteroid and/or immunosuppressant therapy was significantly larger in the ARS-NSIP group than in the I-NSIP group. In addition, the patients in the I-NSIP group who underwent the immunosuppressive therapy demonstrated shorter survival than those who underwent no treatment; this tendency was not observed in the ARS-NSIP group. The 10-year survival rate of patients in the ARS-NSIP group was significantly higher than that of patients in the I-NSIP group (91.8% vs. 43.0%; log-rank, p= 0.012). The multivariate survival analysis revealed that positive anti-ARS antibody was an independent favorable prognostic factor in the patients with NSIP (OR, [95% CI]: 0.12 [0.02-0.55], p= 0.013).
   Conclusions: Patients with ARS-NSIP had a significantly better prognosis than those with I-NSIP; this may be associated with the sensitivity to immunosuppressive therapies, and the different findings of BALF and HRCT between the two groups.

AB Background: Aspirin desensitization (AD) is an effective and safe therapeutic option for patients with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)-exacerbated respiratory disease (N-ERD). The mechanisms driving its beneficial effects remain poorly understood.
   Objective: To investigate the effect of long-term AD on clinical, biochemical and radiological changes in N-ERD patients.
   Methods: The study group consisted of twenty-three individuals with N-ERD who underwent AD, followed by ingestion of 325 mg aspirin twice daily. Twenty patients completed the 52 weeks of AD. The following evaluations were conducted at baseline and in the 52nd week of AD: (i) clinical: asthma exacerbations, Asthma Control Test (ACT), Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for the assessment of nasal symptoms; (ii) blood and induced sputum supernatant (ISS) periostin, (iii) phenotypes based on induced sputum (IS) cells, (iiii) ISS and nasal lavage (NL) concentration of prostaglandin D-2 (PGD(2)), prostaglandin E-2 (PGE(2)), tetranor-PGD-M, tetranor-PGE-M, 8-iso-PGE(2), leukotriene B-4 (LTB4), LTC4, LTD4 and LTE4, and urine LTE4.
   Results: A significant improvement was observed in ACT (P= 0.02) and VAS score (P= 0.008) in the 52nd week of AD. ISS periostin and IS eosinophil count decreased significantly in the 52nd week of AD (P= 0.04 and P= 0.01, respectively). ISS and NL eicosanoid concentrations did not change following long-term AD.
   Conclusion: and Clinical Relevance: AD is associated with a decrease in sputum periostin biosynthesis, which may prevent the recruitment of eosinophils into respiratory tissue and be one of explanation of the clinical benefits of AD. Long-term aspirin administration does not lead to an imbalance between pro-and anti-inflammatory ISS eicosanoids.

AB Background: Asthma is associated with accelerated rate of lung function (FEV1) decline.
   Objective: To determine predictive factors associated with FEV1 decline in adult asthma.
   Methods: A retrospective study was conducted in 229 asthmatics recruited from the University Asthma Clinic of Liege. Subjects had at least two visits with post-bronchodilation (post-BD) FEV1 and minimum one year between them. A multivariable linear regression analysis was conducted in order to come up with factors associated with lung function decline.
   Results: Post-BD FEV1 decline in % predicted. y(-1) was 0.2 (95% CI -2.0 to 2.8) in the overall population. Our population was made up of mild to moderate asthmatics [1] for 58%, aged 50 (41-60) years old, 62% were female and 59% were atopic. Median ICS dose was 1000 mu g beclomethasone equivalent (CFC)/day with 81% treated at baseline. Time between visits was 46.8 +/- 32.1 months. The univariate linear regression analysis revealed a negative association between % predicted FEV1 decline and baseline ACQ (p < 0.0001) and blood eosinophils (% and/mm(3)) (p < 0.0001 and p < 0.0001). A positive association was found between % predicted FEV1 decline and baseline pre-BD FEV1 (mL) values (p= 0.001), blood neutrophils (%) (p= 0.02), change in blood eosinophils (%) (p < 0.0001), time between visits (months) (p < 0.0001). The predictive variables for accelerated decline highlighted by the multivariable analysis (r(2)= 0.39) were change in blood eosinophils (%) over time (p= 0.002) and time between visits (months) (p < 0.0001).
   Conclusion: These findings highlight a new value for blood eosinophil counts as their increase over time predicts greater lung function decline in asthma.

AB Background: Central obesity and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) exposure were reported as independent risk factors for lung function decline. However, the interaction between central obesity and PAHs exposure on lung function is still unclear.
   Objectives: To evaluate the impact of central obesity, urinary polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon metabolites (OH-PAHs) and their combined effects on lung function in general population.
   Methods: Lung function and urinary OH-PAHs were measured for 3,749 participants from the Wuhan-Zhuhai cohort. Central obesity was evaluated by waist-to-hip ratio. Generalized linear regression was used to estimate combined effect of central obesity and OH-PAHs on lung function.
   Results: Compared with participants without central obesity and with low urinary total OH-PAHs (SOH-PAHs) level, those with central obesity and high urinary SOH-PAHs level had 59.4 mL and 61.0 mL reductions for forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1s (FEV1), respectively (P < 0.05). The reductions were more evident in smokers and males. Additive interactions between central obesity and urinary SOH-PAHs on lung function were observed, especially on FEV1 (P < 0.05). Each 1-unit increase in log-transformed value of SOH-PAHs was associated with -34.4 ml (95% confidence interval [CI]: -66.9, -1.8) and -34.8 mL (-61.1, -8.5) changes in FVC and FEV1 among those without central obesity, while -21.4 ml (-49.9, 7.1) and -19.7 ml (-43.4, 4.0) changes among those with central obesity.
   Conclusion: Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons exposure has combined effect with central obesity on lung function parameters.

AB Background and objectives: The incidence of nontuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease NTM-PD) is increasing, while that of tuberculosis TB) is decreasing in many industrialized countries, including Japan. However, the long-term evaluation of clinico-epidemiological features of NTM-PD in relation to TB are limited. We aimed to clarify the long-term changes in the epidemiology and clinical features of NTM-PD in relation to those of TB at a nationally-designated TB center in Japan.
   Methods: We reviewed all mycobacterial examination records at Fukujuji Hospital between 2006 and 2016. Cases of NTM-PD were defined according to the 2007 American Thoracic Society/Infectious Disease Society of America microbiologic criteria. The current characteristics of Mycobacterium avium complex pulmonary disease MAC-PD) were compared with those in the 1980s and circa 2000.
   Results: We identified a total of 3,546 pulmonary TB cases and 2,155 NTM-PD cases. While the annual number of incident pulmonary TB cases remained stable over the study period P= 0.59), that of NTM-PD cases increased significantly from 165 to 278 P < 0.01). The mean age of pulmonary TB cases increased from 59.7 +/- 16.3 to 66.2 +/- 21.7 years, whereas that of NTM-PD cases remained unchanged. Regarding the age distribution, the greatest increases were observed in patients over 75 years for TB and in patients 50-74 years for NTM. The most common causative organism for NTM was Mycobacterium avium complex 87.3%), M. abscessus complex 5.5%) and M. kansasii 3.9%). Among patients with MAC-PD, the proportion of the nodular bronchiectatic NB) form increased significantly from 60.0% to 84.4% between circa 2000 and 2016 P < 0.01). Significant increases in the NB form were observed in both males 33.3%-70.7%, P < 0.01) and females 71.3%-89.2%, P < 0.01).
   Conclusions: The annual number of incident NTM-PD cases increased markedly. In contrast to patients with TB, the mean age of new NTM-PD patients did not increase in the last 10 years. Among MAC-PD patients, the proportions accounted for by the NB form increased significantly in both sexes.

AB Background: COPD patients have an increased risk of developing lung cancer, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. We aimed to identify risk factors for lung cancer in patients from the Bergen COPD Cohort Study.
   Methods: We compared 433 COPD patients with 279 healthy controls, all former or current smokers. All COPD patients had FEV1< 80% and FEV1/FVC-ratio < 0.7. Baseline predictors were sex, age, spirometry, body composition, smoking history, emphysema assessed by CT, chronic bronchitis, prior exacerbation frequency, Charlson Comorbidity Score, inhalation medication and 44 serum/plasma inflammatory biomarkers. Patients were followed up for 9 years recording incidence of lung cancer. Cox-regression models were fitted for the statistical analyses. The biomarkers were evaluated using principal component analysis.
   Results: 28 COPD patients and 3 controls developed lung cancer, COPD patients had a significantly higher risk of developing lung cancer, (HR 5.0; 95% CI 1.5-17.1, p < 0.01, adjusted values). Among COPD patients, emphysema (HR 4.4; 1.7-10.8, p < 0.01) and obesity (HR 3.3; 1.3-8.5, p= 0.02) were associated with a higher cancer rate. Use of inhaled steroids was associated with a lower rate (HR 0.4; 0.2-0.9, p= 0.03). Smoking status, pack-years smoked or levels of systemic inflammatory markers, except for interferon gamma-induced protein 10, did not affect the lung cancer rate in patients with COPD.
   Conclusion: Patients with COPD have a higher lung cancer rate compared to healthy controls adjusted for smoking. The presence of emphysema and obesity in COPD predicted a higher lung cancer risk in COPD patients. Systemic inflammation was not associated with increased lung cancer risk.

AB Background: Sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous disease of unknown etiology that affects the lungs in 90% of patients, but has a wide range of disease manifestations and outcomes including chronic and progressive courses. Noninvasive biomarkers are needed to assess these outcomes and guide decisions for long term monitoring and treatment. Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-inducible chemotactic cytokines (chemokines), CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11, show promise in this regard because they have been implicated in the pathogenesis of and reflect the burden of granulomatous inflammation. CXCL11 has been reported to have unique functional properties in modulating adaptive immunity in model systems so our goal was to examine serum levels of CXCL11 in relation to clinical outcomes in a heterogeneous cohort of sarcoidosis subjects.
   Methods: CXCL19, CXCL10, and CXCL11 serum levels were measured in sarcoidosis and healthy subjects using ELISA assay. We determined relationships between CXCL11 and standard clinical inflammatory markers, expression of IFN-gamma-related genes in whole blood, organ involvement, dyspnea scores, and measures of pulmonary function.
   Results: In a cross-sectional analysis of 104 sarcoidosis subjects, serum CXCL11 was significantly elevated compared to 49 healthy controls (p < 0.001). CXCL11 was positively correlated with CXCL9 and CXCL10 (p < 0.001), sedimentation rate (p < 0.01), and mean expression of three IFN-gamma-related genes in whole blood (GBP1, STAT1, and STAT2) (p < 0.001). CXCL11 was inversely correlated with FVC % predicted (% pred) and FEV1 % pred and higher levels were associated with higher patient-reported dyspnea scores. We found positive correlations between CXCL11 and number of organs involved. Using survival analyses, we found that CXCL11 levels were predictive of future pulmonary function test (PFT) decline (log rank< 0.001 and HR of log(10)(CXCL11)= 5.1, 95% CI 1.2-21, p= 0.026).
   Conclusions: The pattern of expression of serum CXCL11 in sarcoidosis patients suggests that this blood measure could be helpful in identifying patients that need longer-term monitoring for progressive thoracic and extrathoracic sarcoidosis.

AB Mild asthma is present in 50-75% of patients with asthma and is defined by the Global Initiative for Asthma as asthma that can be well controlled with low-intensity treatments (Steps 1 and 2). Despite this definition, 'mild' asthma is often not well controlled in reality, and can have a significant impact on an individual's symptom burden and quality of life.
   We performed a PubMed literature search to investigate the burden of 'mild' asthma in the lives of patients, including future risk and asthma control, and the current management strategies. While clinical guidelines recommend long-term, daily, low-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) for 'mild' asthma, published data suggest that ICS are often under-prescribed or used intermittently as symptoms arise. Furthermore, patients and physicians tend to overestimate disease control, impacting the accuracy of diagnosing 'mild asthma' and subsequent management. This disconnect may be amplified by miscommunication between patients and physicians, limited objective assessment of control, and differences in guidelines.
   As with moderate and severe asthma, current evidence supports early initiation of regular ICS in 'mild' asthma to address the underlying inflammation, achieve symptom control and reduce risk of exacerbations. Adherence to ICS treatment is key and can be improved by educating both patients and healthcare professionals. The results of this literature search challenge the term 'mild' asthma and suggest strategies to improve the proactive management of the disease to enable patients to live symptom-free.

TI Asthma as aetiology of bronchiectasis in Finland
SO RESPIRATORY MEDICINE
LA English

DE Asthma; Comorbidity; COPD; Extensive disease
ID CYSTIC FIBROSIS BRONCHIECTASIS; ADULT PATIENTS; DISEASE; COHORT
AB Background: By definition bronchiectasis (BE) means destructed structure of normal bronchus as a consequence of frequent bacterial infections and inflammation. In many senses, BE is a neglected orphan disease. A recent pan-European registry study, EMBARC, has been set up in order to better understand its pathophysiology, better phenotype patients, and to individualize their management.
   Aim: To examine the aetiology and co-morbidity of BE in the capital area in Finland.
   Methods: Two hundred five patients with BE diagnosis and follow up visits between 2016 and 2017 in Helsinki University Hospital were invited to participate in the study. Baseline demographics, lung functions, imaging, microbiological, and therapeutic data, together with co-morbidities were entered into EMBARC database. Clinical characteristics, aetiologic factors, co-morbidities, and risk factors for extensive BE were explored.
   Results: To the study included 95 adult patients and seventy nine percent of the BE patients were women. The mean age was 69 years (SD +/- 13). Asthma was a comorbid condition in 68% of the patients but in 26% it was estimated to be the cause of BE. Asthma was aetiological factor for BE if it had been diagnosed earlier than BE. As 41% BE were idiopathic, in 11% the disorder was postinfectious and others were associated to rheumatic disease, Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, IgG deficiency and Kartagener syndrome. The most common co-morbidities in addition to asthma were cardiovascular disease (30%), gastroesophageal reflux disease (26%), overweight (22%), diabetes (16%), inactive neoplasia (15%), and immunodeficiency (12%). Extensive BE was found in 68% of BE patients in whom four or more lobes were affected. Risk factors for extensive BE were asthma (OR 2.7), asthma as aetiology for BE (OR 4.3), and rhinosinusitis (OR 3.1).
   Conclusions: Asthma was associated to BE in 68% and it was estimated as aetiology in every fourth patient. However, retrospectively, it is difficult to exclude asthma as a background cause in patients with asthma-like symptoms and respiratory infections. We propose asthma as an aetiology factor for BE if it is diagnosed earlier than BE. Asthma and rhinosinusitis were predictive for extensive BE.

AB Very recently, several studies have found that homogeneous reducing agents (e.g., sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O3), and sodium sulfite (Na2SO3)) can activate ferrate to enhance the degradation of selected contaminants. In this work, it was found that heterogeneous carbon nanotube (CNT) could accelerate ferrate (Fe(VI)) for the degradation of bromophenols (BrPs) of environmental concerns and alleviate the appearance of undesired by-products in effluent. Fe(V1) could react with BrPs over a wide pH range of 6 10 with apparent second -order rate constants of 1.8-1850 M-1 s(-1). Electrospray ionization-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (ESI-QqQMS) analysis showed that dibrominated dihydroxylated biphenyls and dibrominated phenoxyphenols were possibly formed via coupling reaction of BrPs radicals generated from Fe(VI) oxidation through one-electron transfer. The presence of CNT could remarkably accelerate the degradation rates of BrPs by Fe(VI) in a wide pH range from 7 to 10. Moreover, the formed undesired polybrominated products during Fe(VI)/CNT oxidation were absorbed on CNT surface and thus removed from treated water. The Fe(VI)/CNT system was capable of selectively oxidizing electron-rich pollutants (e.g., BrPs, and sulfamethoxazole (SMX)), but reluctant to iopamidol (IPM) and nitrobenzene (NB). High-valent metal-oxo intermediates Fe(V)/Fe(IV) formed in situ from the reaction of CNT with Fe(VI) were likely responsible for this activation effect of CNT, which was further confirmed via using methyl phenyl sulfoxide (PMSO) as a probe compound. Comparatively, homogeneous reducing agent Na2S2O3 could enhance Fe(VI) degradation of BrPs at pH 7 and 8, while undesired polybrominated products were detected in effluent from Fe(VI)/Na2S2O3 system. These findings have crucial implications for the development of a promising oxidation process by combination of Fe(VI) and CNT for water and wastewater treatment. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Microorganism removal efficiencies in deep bed filters vary with time and depth in the filter bed as the filter collects particles. Improved knowledge of such dynamics is relevant for the design, operation and microbial risk assessment of filtration processes for drinking water treatment. Here we report on a high resolution spatio-temporal characterization of virus and bacteria removal in a pilot-scale dual-media filter, operated in contact-filtration mode. Microorganisms investigated were bacteriophage Salmonella typhimurium 28B (plaque assay, n = 154)), fRNA phage MS2 (plaque assay/RT-qPCR, n = 87) and E. coli (Colilert-18, n = 73). Microscopic and macroscopic filtration models were used to investigate and characterize the removal dynamics.
   Results show that ripening/breakthrough fronts for turbidity, viruses and E. coli migrated in a wavelike manner across the depth of the filter. Virus removal improved continuously throughout the filter cycle and viruses broke through almost simultaneously with turbidity. Ripening for E. coli took longer than ripening for turbidity, but the bacteria broke through before turbidity breakthrough. Instantaneous log-removal peaked at 3.2, 3.0 and 4.5 for 28B, MS2 and E. coli, respectively. However, true average log removal during the period of stable effluent turbidity was significantly lower at 2.5, 2.3 and 3.6, respectively. Peak observed filter coefficients lambda were higher than predicted by ideal filtration theory. This study demonstrates the importance of carefully designed sampling regimes when characterizing microorganism removal efficiencies of deep bed filters. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The organic matter present in wastewater effluents (EfOM), is likely to have different properties than the organic matter present in the receiving water. The properties of EfOM will affect the fate of contaminants of emerging concern because EfOM is a source of photochemically produced reactive intermediates (PPRIs) capable of transforming contaminants. Effluent water samples were taken seasonally from sixteen wastewater treatment plants in Minnesota and two effluent dominated rivers in California and Arizona. Samples (n = 94) were tested for water chemistry, light absorption characteristics, and excited state triplet organic matter ((3)EfOM*) and singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) production. Based on analysis of spectral parameters, EfOM had higher molecular weight and lower aromatic content than organic matter present in stormwaters from Minnesota, which are representative of human-impacted natural organic matter (NOM) containing waters. The second order rate constant for the reaction of the (3)EfOM* probe 2,4,6-trimethylephenol (k(T,TMP)) for the effluents was 7.79 (+/- 3.03) x 10(8) M(-1)s(-1), and this value was used to calculate apparent quantum yields for (3)EfOM* production, which ranged from 0.006 to 0.114. The quantum yield for the production of singlet oxygen ranged from 0.007 to 0.064. Processes in the wastewater treatment train, season, and water chemistry parameters did not serve as predictors of (3)EfOM* or 102 production. Among the parameters measured, Spearman rank correlations were strongest between quantum yields of O-1(2) and 3EfOM* and E2/E3 (absorption at 250 nm/absorption at 365 nm). This relationship, however, is weaker than that previously observed for NOM. The efficiency of O-1(2) production from (3)EfOM* was 54%. Results indicate that 2,4,6-trimethylphenol samples nearly all of the triplets in EfOM that have sufficient energy to produce O-1(2), which may not be the case for NOM. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Nitrification and denitrification, the key biological processes for thermophilic nitrogen removal, have separately been established in bioreactors at 50 degrees C. A well-characterized set of kinetic parameters is essential to integrate these processes while safeguarding the autotrophs performing nitrification. Knowledge on thermophilic nitrifying kinetics is restricted to isolated or highly enriched batch cultures, which do not represent bioreactor conditions. This study characterized the stoichiometry and kinetics of two thermophilic (50 degrees C) nitrifying communities. The most abundant ammonia oxidizing archaea (AOA) were related to the Nitrososphaera genus, clustering relatively far from known species Nitrososphaera gargensis (95.5% 16S rRNA gene sequence identity). The most abundant nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB) were related to Nitrospira calida (97% 16S rRNA gene sequence identity). The nitrification biomass yield was 0.20-0.24 g VSS g(-1) N, resulting mainly from a high AOA yield (0.16-0.20 g VSS g(-1) N), which was reflected in a high AOA abundance in the community (57-76%) compared to NOB (5-11%). Batch-wise determination of decay rates (AOA: 0.23-0.29 d(-1); NOB: 0.32-0.43 d(-1)) rendered an overestimation compared to in situ estimations of overall decay rate (0.026-0.078 d(-1)). Possibly, the inactivation rate rather than the actual decay rate was determined in batch experiments. Maximum growth rates of AOA and NOB were 0.12-0.15 d(-1) and 0.13-033 d(-1) respectively. NOB were susceptible to nitrite, opening up opportunities for shortcut nitrogen removal. However, NOB had a similar growth rate and oxygen affinity (0.15-0.55 mg O-2 L-1) as AOA and were resilient towards free ammonia (IC50 > 16 mg NH3-N L-1). This might complicate NOB outselection using common practices to establish shortcut nitrogen removal (SRT control; aeration control; free ammonia shocks). Overall, the obtained insights can assist in integrating thermophilic conversions and facilitate single-sludge nitrification/denitrification. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Over the past few decades, seawater desalination has become a necessity for freshwater supply in many countries worldwide, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions. One potentially high-quality feed water for desalination is saline groundwater (SGW) from coastal aquifers, which has lower fouling propensity than seawater. This study examines the effect of pumping SGW from a phreatic coastal aquifer on fresh groundwater, particularly on the dynamics of the fresh-saline water interface (FSI). Initially, we constructed a 3D finite-element model of a phreatic coastal aquifer by using the FEFLOW software, which solves the coupled variable density groundwater flow and solute transport equations. Then, we compared and validated the results of the model to those of a field-scale pumping test. The model indicates that pumping SGW from a coastal aquifer freshens the aquifer and rehabilitates parts that were salinized due to seawater intrusion - an effect that increases with increasing pumping rate. In addition, when simultaneously pumping fresh groundwater further inland and SGW from below the FSI, the freshening effect is less pronounced and the salinity of the aquifer is more stable. In line with the results of the model, the field experiment revealed that salinity in the observation well decreases over the course of pumping. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that, in addition to providing a high-quality source feed water for desalination, pumping SGW does not salinize the aquifer and even rehabilitates it by negating the effect of seawater intrusion. These findings are important for planning shoreline desalination facilities and for managing arid coastal regions with lack of water supply and over exploited aquifers.

AB Bacterial aerosols resulting from membrane bioreactor (MBR) processes, which require excessive aeration in a confined space, are important to investigate because of their possible adverse effects on human health. This study investigated the influence of solid retention time (SRT) on bacterial aerosols from MBRs. Moreover, powdered activated carbon (PAC) and calcium were used to attenuate bacterial aerosol emissions from MBRs. The particulate matter (PM) emitted from the MBRs was reduced by 30.5 and 25.2% at SRTs of 20 and 80 d, respectively, compared to the level emitted at an SRT of 10 d. Total cell counts were similarly reduced at SRTs of 20 and 80 d. Longer SRTs also led to greater reductions in the particle size distribution of the sludge within 10 mu m. Several factors in the MBR influenced the behavior of the bacterial aerosol emissions from the MBRs. This study showed that changes in viscosity and particle size induced by the SRT influenced the bacterial aerosol emissions in MBRs. Therefore, SRT was identified as an important design parameter affecting bacterial aerosol emissions in MBR processes. The amounts of particulate matter and bacterial aerosols were reduced in MBRs using PAC and calcium, both of which exerted an immediate effect on the bacterial aerosol emissions in MBRs by increasing the aerosol-particle size.

AB Because of its energy efficiency, the anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) process has been recognized as the most promising biological nitrogen removal process, but its implementation in mainstream wastewater treatment plants is limited by its relatively high optimal temperature (30 degrees C). Recently, it was shown that during short-term batch experiments, reduced graphene oxide (RGO) displayed accelerated reaction activity at low temperatures (10-15 degrees C). In this study, the long-term effects of RGO on the low-temperature anammox process in a sequencing batch reactor (SBR), are studied for the first time, including different methods of interaction. The results presented here show that RGO can stimulate anammox activity up to 17% through two factors: bacterial growth stimulation, which was especially significant at higher temperatures (>15 degrees C), and an increase of the anammox reaction rate, which occurred only below 15 degrees C. The bacterial community structure was not influenced by addition of RGO. Moreover, after incubation in an anammox bioreactor, RGO showed signs of degradation and chemical changes as evidenced by the presence of oxygen and calcium on its surface. According to the literature and the obtained results, it is proposed that RGO is oxidized and oxygen is reduced by the organic mediator that is involved in the enzymatic reactions. However, activated sludge is a very complex structure created by numerous, undefined microorganisms, which makes it difficult to determine the exact oxidation mechanism. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The unique properties of ionic liquids make them attractive for a wide range of industrial applications, which makes it easy to be released into the environment and cause water or soil pollution. Phytoremediation of organic contaminants is a safe and important process for removing persistent pollutants from the environment. However, due to they are very chemically stable and potentially toxic to plants, whether they can be removed, assimilated and metabolized by plants remains unknown during phytoremediation process. In this study, ryegrass, Lolium perenne L, was used for imidazolium ionic liquid (1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide, [C(4)mim](+)) removal from water. The results show that [C(4)mim](+) could be taken up, accumulated and metabolized by plants in vivo with a high removal efficiency. Most of the [C(4)mim](+) was accumulated in the root tissue, with the root concentration fraction factors ranging from 4.9 to 51.5. Two hydroxylated metabolites 1-(4-hydroxybutyl)-3-methylimidazolium, and 1-(n-butyl)-3-(hydroxymethyl)-imidazolium, and two secondary metabolites were detected in the ryegrass after [C(4)mim](+) uptake. The metabolic mechanism was clarified using density functional theory calculations. Furthermore, [C(4)mim](+) at a high concentration was found to be high toxic to inhibit the growth of ryegrass markedly. In response, some oxidative stress was observed in the metabolic process, as indicated by increasing of catalase, super dismutase and peroxidase activities. Our results suggested that phytoremediation was an efficient technique for ionic liquids treatment from water. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The toxicity of contaminants in freshwater ecosystems can increase in combination with environmental stress, leading to a potential underestimation of risk in conventional assessments. The number of multiple-stress experiments in ecotoxicology is growing constantly, but pharmaceuticals have mostly been disregarded. As an omnipresent pharmaceutical in the water cycle, the antiepileptic drug carbamazepine (CBZ) was chosen as test substance for our 28-day binary stress experiments with the non biting midge Chironomus riparius. Elevated population densities, food limitation, temperature, and a reduction of organic matter (OM) were chosen as relevant environmental stressors. In five stress intensities, they were combined with the 10% lethal concentration (LC10) of CBZ to investigate the joint effect of stress and CBZ exposure. We were able to demonstrate that the toxicity of CBZ increased with higher larval densities and reduced OM. Mortality of the midges exposed to CBZ increased by a factor of 1.69 with 100 larvae per vessel and by a factor of 2.87 at 0.25% OM compared to the conventional test protocol, while the stressors alone did not reduce survival. Conventional low-stress laboratory tests as conducted for the risk assessment of chemicals would have underestimated the toxicity of CBZ. Even though it is necessary that more than binary stressor combinations are included in future experiments, the present results extend our knowledge about the toxicity of pharmaceuticals, such as CBZ, in stressful environments and emphasize the importance of including pharmaceuticals in multiple stress experiments.

AB Forward osmosis (FO) has gained increasing interests in wastewater treatment and reclamation. However, membrane fouling has become one major obstacle hindering FO application. A novel mitigation approach for FO membrane fouling via in situ extracting Ca2+ binding with the organic foulants using the gradient diffusion thin-films (DGT) was proposed in this study. The DGT could effectively adsorb the Ca2+ binding with the sodium alginate via the chelation of the Chelex functional groups, and its adsorption amount of Ca2+ correspondingly increased as a function of the Ca2+ concentration in the feed solution. Owing to the extraction of Ca2+ from the fouling layer by the DGT, the FO membrane fouling was effectively mitigated evident by significant enhancement of water flux, and at the same time, foulants became easily removed by physical cleaning. The alleviation of FO membrane fouling by the DGT could be attributed to the fact that the structure of the fouling layer became more porous and looser after in situ removing Ca2+ from the alginate-Ca2+ gel networks. The feasibility of fouling control strategy via in situ removing Ca2+ binding with the foulants in the fouling layer was demonstrated, which provides new insights into fouling control mechanisms during FO treating wastewater.

AB This study investigated the effects of ferrate and ozone pre-oxidation on disinfection byproduct (DBP) formation from subsequent chlorination or chloramination. Two natural waters were treated at bench scale under various scenarios (chlorine, chloramine, each with ferrate pre-oxidation, and each with preozonation). The formation of brominated and iodinated DBPs in fortified natural waters was assessed. Results indicated ferrate and ozone pre-oxidation were comparable at molar equivalent doses for most DBPs. A net decrease in trihalomethanes (including iodinated forms), haloacetic acids (HAAs), dihaloacetonitrile, total organic chlorine, and total organic iodine was found with both pre-oxidants as compared to chlorination only. An increase in chloropicrin and minor changes in total organic bromine yield were caused by both pre-oxidants compared to chlorination only. However, ozone led to higher haloketone and chloropicrin formation potentials than ferrate. The relative performance of ferrate versus ozone for DBP precursor removal was affected by water quality (e.g., nature of organic matter and bromide concentration) and oxidant dose, and varied by DBP species. Ferrate and ozone pre-oxidation also decreased DBP formation from chioramination under most conditions. However, some increases in THM and dihaloacetonitrile formation potentials were observed at elevated bromide levels. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A microbial fuel cell system with intimately coupled photocatalytic-electrogenic anode (photocatalytic-MFC) was proposed for the synergetic degradation of 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (2,4,6-TCP) which has a structure of three chlorine groups connecting to a phenol ring and is well recognized as a recalcitrant pollutant for its high toxicity, bioaccumulation and persistence. The photocatalytic-electrogenic anode was prepared by coating mpg-C3N4 on a carbon felt anode, followed by inoculating with municipal sewage and acclimating with 2,4,6-TCP at gradient concentrations. Improved TCP degradation was achieved, showing 79.3% of TCP removal in 10 h with an original concentration of 200 mg L-1, which was higher than that obtained with the unilluminated MFC (66.0%) and the photocatalytic-only process (56.1%). The coupled photocatalytic-electrogenic process demonstrated different degradation pathways compared with the photocatalytic-only process, with one open-chain compound (2-chloro-4-keto-2-hexenedioic acid, 2-CMA) detected in the photocatalytic-MFC system. Microbial community analysis revealed that Pseudomonas, instead of Geobacter observed in the unilluminated MFC bioanode, dominated in the photocatalytic-electrogenic anode MFC biofilm, which might be responsible for enhanced current generation in the coupled system. In addition, biofilm rich with Rhodococcus on air-cathode was also responsible for the enhanced TCP removal. This research provides an efficient strategy for the treatment of wastewater with recalcitrant contaminants by intimate-coupling of the photocatalytic and the electrogenic processes.

AB Cyanobacterial blooms represent a worldwide problem in freshwater as well as marine ecosystems as producers of various toxic compounds. This study provides environmentally important information about the common presence of mixtures of retinoids in various water bodies associated with the occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms dominated by many different species. The study documents, for the first time, that retinoids are produced by environmental cyanobacterial blooms dominated by species belonging to different genera such as Microcystis, Dolichospermum, Planktothrix, Woronichinia, Pseudanabaena and others. Samples of biomass of cyanobacterial blooms and their surrounding water were collected from seventeen independent freshwater bodies across the Czech Republic during summer 2015. Retinoid-like activity was detected by an in vitro reporter gene bioassay in water samples from 8 out of 17 localities with a maximal activity of 263 ng all-trans retinoic acid equivalent (REQ)/L. In comparison, in vitro assessment of biomass extracts documented retinoid-like activity at 11 out of 17 localities with a maximal retinoid-like activity of 867 ng REQ/g dry mass (dm). Individual retinoids were detected by chemical analyses in all water samples and in 16 out of 17 biomass samples with 4keto-retinal and all trans 5,6epoxy retinoic acid being detected in aquatic ecosystems for the first time. Further, all-trans 4keto retinoic acid and retinal were the most commonly detected compounds in both types of samples. With respect to retinoid-like activity, a large proportion was explained in some samples by contributions of individual detected retinoids calculated from their concentrations and relative potencies. However, results also indicate that other unknown compounds with a retinoic acid receptor-mediated mode of action were present. The revealed widespread production of retinoids by cyanobacterial blooms dominated by diverse species across various aquatic ecosystems and their common presence in both biomass and surrounding water raises concern namely because some retinoids belong to the most potent teratogens. These compounds need to be taken into consideration in the assessment of risks associated with massive cyanobacterial blooms. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Nearly half of all cases of foodborne illness are associated with plant-based foods such as leafy greens and raw flour. An important potential source of pathogen contamination along the food-production continuum is irrigation water, which has led to the implementation of increasingly stringent agricultural irrigation water quality requirements. To better understand factors impacting irrigation water quality, we investigated sources of generic Escherichia coli and how they varied temporally among different sampling sites. Precipitation, Campylobacter species distribution, and physicochemical water quality parameters were also investigated to substantiate microbial source tracking findings. Biweekly sampling was conducted at a reservoir outlet and two downstream canals in southern Alberta, Canada, throughout two irrigation seasons, the latter of which was notable for drought conditions. Overall, 50% of canal samples exceeded Alberta's irrigation guideline for E. coli (100 E. coli per 100 ml), whereas all reservoir samples were below guideline limits. Collectively, E. coli source apportionment, Campylobacter species distribution, and physicochemical water quality data suggest runoff from surrounding agricultural land was a contributing factor to E. coli guideline exceedances in Year 1 only. In Year 2, the majority of exceedances occurred later in the season when there was little precipitation and were largely attributed to cosmopolitan E. coli from wild birds and cattle. Similarities in E. coli host-source and Campylobacter species distributions between the reservoir and canals when the guideline was exceeded suggest the reservoir could be a primary source of E. coil during drought. Increased bacterial concentrations in canals were likely due to environmental conditions that promoted bacterial survival and in-situ proliferation. Our findings support previous accounts that many E. coli isolates possess enhanced survival capabilities, which has implications to bacterial water quality assessments and risk mitigation, particularly under drought conditions.

AB Quorum quenching (QQ) is an effective method to control membrane biofouling in aerobic membrane bioreactors (AeMBRs). However, it is not clear if QQ is feasible in an anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR). In this study, Microbacterium. sp that has QQ capability was embedded in alginate beads, known as QQ beads (QQB), and applied in a lab-scale AnMBR to investigate their potential in fouling control. With the addition of QQB, the operating period of AnMBR-QQB reactor was prolonged by about 8 -10 times at constant flux operation before reaching the pre-set maximum transmembrane pressure (TMP). The concentration of Acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs) in the bulk liquid was significantly higher during the 'TMP jump' period compared to QQB and control phases, while AHL5 in the membrane foulants were remarkably lower in QQB phase compared to control phase. Furthermore, a much lower level of soluble microbial production (SMP) was observed in QQB phases. Extracellular polymeric substance (EPS), protein in particular, was reduced by 39.73-80.58% in the cake layer of the membrane from QQB phases. Significant changes of organic functional groups were observed in cake layer from QQB membrane as compared with that from control membrane. At the end of operation, bio-polymer (BP), building blocks (BB) and low molecular weight (LMW) organic matters increased in the foulant from control phases but such increase was not observed in QQB phase. After long-term operation, revival of QQB is required due to the declined activity for AHL5 degradation. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The removal of bromide (Br-) and iodide (I-) from source waters mitigates the formation of brominated and iodinated disinfection by-products (DBPs), which are more toxic than their chlorinated analogues. In this study, we report on our recently developed environmental-friendly method for the preparation of novel silver chloride/superfine activated carbon composite (AgCI-SPAC) to rapidly and selectively remove Br- and I- from surface waters. The material characteristics were tracked, before and after treatment, using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) spectroscopies. The results showed very fast removal kinetics of Br- and I- by AgCI-SPAC with equilibrium times at 150 s and <105, respectively (i.e., 2-3 orders of magnitudes faster than previously tested Ag-based composites). In addition, AgCl-SPAC was evaluated under eight different Cl- concentrations up to 400 mg/L and exhibited high removal efficiencies for I- (i.e., >90% at all tested conditions) and Br- (i.e, >80% at Cl- = 0.5-200 mg/L, and 60-75% at extreme Cl- conditions = 300-400 mg/L). Unlike previous Ag-based composites, AgCl-SPAC performance was not affected by elevated concentrations of two types of natural organic matter (2-16 mg-NOM/L). The superior performance was further confirmed in four different surface waters and one groundwater. After the removal of Br- and I- from all waters by AgCl-SPAC, the subsequent DBPs formation (tri-halomethanes, haloacetic acids, and haloacetonitriles), total organic halogens (TOX), bromine substitution factor (BSF), and calculated cytotoxicity under the uniform formation conditions (UFC) decreased significantly. Overall, this novel composite represents a promising alternative approach, to be integrated continuously or seasonally, for controlling the formation of brominated and/or iodinated DBPs at water treatment plants.

AB Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs), polyphosphate (poly-P) and polysulfide or elemental sulfur (poly-S) are the key functionally relevant polymers involved in the recently reported Denitrifying Sulfur conversion associated Enhanced Biological Phosphorus Removal (DS-EBPR) process. However, little is known about the structural dynamics and storage states of these polymers. In particular, investigating the poly-S generated in this process is quite a superior challenge. This study was thus aimed at simultaneously qualitative-quantitative investigating poly-S and associated poly-P and PHAs through the integrated chemical analysis and Raman micro-spectroscopy coupled with multiple microscopic methods (i.e. optical microscopy, confocal laser scanning microscopy, and differential interference contrast microscopy). The chemical analytical results displayed a stable DS-EBPR phenotype in terms of sulfur conversion, P release/uptake and the dynamics of relevant polymers. The multiple microscopic images and Raman spectrum profiles further clearly demonstrated the existence of the polymers and their dynamic changes under alternating anaerobic-anoxic conditions, consistent with the chemical analytical results. In particular, Raman analysis for the first time unraveled the co-existence of S-0/S-n(2-) species stored either intracellularly or extracellularly; and the dynamic conversions between S-0/S-n(2-) and other sulfur species suggest that there might be a universal pool of bioavailable sulfur. The results reveal the mechanisms underlying the structural dynamics and changes in storage states of the relevant polymers that are functionally relevant to the carbon/phosphorus/sulfur-cycles during different metabolic phases. These mechanisms would otherwise not be obtained only using a traditional chemical analysis-based approach. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB While the predicted or observed concentrations of Ag NPs in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) have ranged from mu g/L to ng/L, there is still uncertainty with regards to the realistic concentration range of Ag NPs in WWTPs. In addition, the persistence, removal, and size of Ag NPs throughout WWTP process is also not well investigated, particularly in real operating conditions. In this study, the incidence and persistence of Ag NPs in the wastewater process were studied by using single particle inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (sp-ICP-MS). The incidence of Ag NPs was determined in samples collected at the influent and effluent of the conventional process, as well as reclaimed and backwash waters of the ultrafiltration (UF) system in a WWTP (Santa Barbara, CA), showing a concentration of 13.5, 3.2, 0.5 and 9.8 ng/L, respectively, with relative standard deviations (RSDs) < 5%. Total Ag concentration (Ag NP and Ag+) ranged from 40 to 70 ng/L, in line with lower predicted values. Most of the Ag NPs detected were below 100 nm, with a few above 100 nm in the conventional effluent. Biological and physical processes in the secondary treatment removed 76.3% of the colloidal Ag fraction, while with the tertiary treatment (UF) the WWTP achieved a removal of 96.3% of the colloidal fraction. Persistence of Ag NPs in various water matrixes, including a synthetic wastewater (SWW), was determined by spiking 300 ng/L of Ag NPs (40 nm) and monitoring the concentrations and size change for 15 days. The persistence of Ag NPs in suspension was Influent > Effluent > Reclaimed > SWW. Partial dissolution of NPs in all waters was observed from time 0 h. Although the current concentrations in the outlet flows from WWTP (effluent and reclaimed waters) were low, the presence of small and stable Ag NPs may raise ecotoxicological concerns via bioaccumulation.

AB The anaerobic process is a favorable alternative for the treatment of antibiotic pharmaceutical wastewater. The electrically assisted anaerobic process can be used to accelerate contaminant removal, especially for persistent organic pollutants such as antibiotics. In this study, an electrically assisted anaerobic system for chloramphenicol (CAP) wastewater treatment was developed. The system performance and the underlying metabolic mechanisms were evaluated under different applied voltages. With the increase of applied voltage from 0 to 2 V, the CAP removal efficiencies increased from 53.3% to 89.7%, while the methane production increased more than three times. The microbial community structure and correlation analysis showed that electrical stimulation selected the dominant functional bacteria and increased antibiotic resistance in dominant functional bacteria, both of which enhanced CAP removal and methane production. The improved CAP removal was a result of the presence of dechlorination-related bacteria (Acidovorax, Sedimentibacter, Thauera, and Flavobacterium) and potential electroactive bacteria (Shewanella and Comamonas), both of which carried ARGs and therefore could survive the biotoxicity of CAP. The enhanced methane production could be partly attributed to the surviving fermentative-related bacteria (Paludibacter, Proteiniclasticum, and Macellibacteroides) in the anaerobic bioreactor. The increased abundances of methanogenic genes (mcrA and ACAS genes) under high voltage further confirmed the enhanced methane production of this electrically assisted anaerobic system. The fundamental understanding of the mechanisms underlying metabolic performance enhancement is critical for the further development of anaerobic wastewater treatment. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB We previously demonstrated the existence of naturalized strains of E. col( in wastewater and herein perform an in-depth comparative whole genome analysis of these strains (n = 17). Fourteen of the Canadian E. coli strains, isolated from geographically separated wastewater treatment plants, were virtually identical at the core genome and were >96% similar at the whole genome level, suggesting clonal-relatedness among these isolates. Remarkably, these strains were shown to be extremely similar to the genome of an E. coli isolated from wastewater in Switzerland, suggesting a global distribution of these strains. The genomes of three other Canadian wastewater strains were more diverse but very similar to the genomes of E. coli isolates collected from U.S. wastewater samples. Based on maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis, wastewater strains from Canada, the U.S. and Switzerland formed a Glade separate from other known enteric phylogroups (i.e., A, B1, B2, D, E) and the cryptic clades. All Canadian, Swiss and U.S. wastewater strains possessed a common SNP biomarker pattern across their genomes, and a sub-population (i.e., 14 Canadian and 1 Swiss strain) also possessed a previously identified wastewater-specific marker known as uspC-IS30-flhDC element. Biochemical heat mapping of 518 categories of genes recapitulated phylogeny, with wastewater strains phenotypically clustering separately from enteric and cryptic clades. Wastewater strains were enriched for stress-response genes (i.e., nutrient acquisition/deprivation, DNA repair, oxidative stress, and UV resistance) - elements reflective of their environmental survival challenges. Wastewater strains were shown to carry a plethora of known antibiotic resistance (AR) genes, the patterns of which were remarkably similar among all Canadian, U.S. and Swiss wastewater strains. Virulence gene composition was also similar among all the wastewater strains, with an abundant representation of virulence genes commonly associated with urinary pathogenic E. coli (UPEC) as well as enterohemorrhagic (EHEC) E. coli. The remarkable degree of similarity between all wastewater strains from Canada, Switzerland and the U.S. suggests the evolution and global dissemination of water treatment-resistant clone of E. coli. These finding, along with others, raise some important concerns about the potential for emergence of E. coli pathotypes resistant to water-treatment. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The effect of pH on nitrous oxide (N2O) production rates was quantified in an intermittently-fed lab-scale sequencing batch reactor performing high-rate nitritation. N2O and other nitrogen (N) species (e.g. ammonium (NH4+), nitrite, hydroxylamine and nitric oxide) were monitored to identify in-cycle dynamics and determine N conversion rates at controlled pH set-points (6.5, 7, 7.5, 8 and 8.5). Operational conditions and microbial compositions remained similar during long-term reactor-scale pH campaigns. The specific ammonium removal rates and nitrite accumulation rates varied little with varying pH levels (p > 0.05). The specific net N2O production rates and net N2O yield of NH4+ removed (Delta N2O/Delta NH4+) increased up to seven-fold from pH 6.5 to 8, and decreased slightly with further pH increase to 8.5 (p < 0.05). Best-fit model simulations predicted nitrifier denitrification as the dominant N2O production pathway (>= 87% of total net N2O production) at all examined pH. Our study highlights the effect of pH on biologically mediated N2O emissions in nitrogen removal systems and its importance in the design of N2O mitigation strategies. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The present study shows the results of solar photo-Fenton oxidation of paracetamol (PCT) and amoxicillin (AMX). Fe-2(SO4)(3) was used as the source of iron and EDDS as the iron complexing agent, employing different doses of hydrogen peroxide. Two aqueous matrices, a synthetic wastewater and real wastewater from El Ejido WWTP effluent (Almeria) were used. In all cases, the process was operated under conditions of natural sunlight.
   Results showed that the degradation of both drugs is favoured when the aqueous matrix presents low concentration of carbonates. Under the conditions studied here, degradation percentages above 90% were obtained in the synthetic wastewater and 80% in the actual effluent. The degradation products were determined using liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry with hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight analyser. The intermediates detected throughout the oxidative process for both micro-contaminants were mainly products of hydroxylation reactions.
   The toxicity of the samples was determined using the bacterium Vibrio fischeri. In the acute toxicity test, it was observed that the bacteria did not undergo inhibition in any of the cases. However, chronic toxicity studies showed that the higher the Hydraulic Retention Time (HRT) employed in the assays, the higher the bacterial inhibition. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB It is vital to understand long-term trends in water quality parameters when assessing the sustainability of groundwater abstraction. Withdrawal-to-availability analysis is still used widely in groundwater management considering quantities and utilization rates based on in- and outflows. In this study, we took a step further than the water balance approach and carried out a detailed investigation of trends in long-term time series of groundwater quality, in order to analyze the sustainability of groundwater abstraction. We assessed trends, links, and patterns in abstraction, potentiometric surface, and water quality parameters for 28 well fields around Copenhagen, Denmark. Groundwater monitoring data from 1900 until 2014 were investigated for each well field. During this period, the well fields experienced a 2 -14 m decrease in the nearby potentiometric surface compared to the first-or pre-pumping-potentiometric surface recordings. Sulfate concentrations increased in 25 out of 27 well fields after the maximum abstraction period, compared to the earliest water quality measurements. The results indicate that in the 1980s, when water consumption (abstraction) and drawdown were at their highest, water abstraction caused a steady increase in sulfate and calcium, which we consider unsustainable. In contradiction, the abstraction in 24 well fields show almost steady sulfate levels in the aquifer after decreased water consumption since 1995. Only four well fields showed more than a 20 mg/L increase in sulfate concentration, which indicates that the recent abstraction does not interfere with sulfate levels in the aquifer. Our method and results show how long-term water quality trends can support the management of aquifer exploitation and evaluate sustainability on the well field scale. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Field-scale studies of natural colloid mobilization and transport in finely fractured aquifer as well as the source identification of groundwater colloids are of great importance to the safety of shallow groundwater. In this study, the daily monitoring of fracture flow from a sloping farmland plot and the biweekly monitoring of three lowland shallow wells within the same catchment were carried out simultaneously in 2013. The effects of physicochemical perturbations on groundwater colloid dynamics were explored in detail using partial redundancy analysis, structural equation modeling, Pearson correlation and multi linear regression analyses. The characterization and source identification of groundwater colloids were addressed via multiple parameters. The daily colloid concentration in the fracture flow varied between 0.54 and 31.90 mg/L (1.64 mg/L on average). Unique periods of high colloid concentration (5.59 mg/L on average) occurred during the initially generated flow following the dry season. In comparison, a narrower colloid concentration range of 0.24-11.66 mg/L was observed in the lowland shallow wells, with a smaller temporal variation than that of the fracture flow. A low percentage (2.4-7.0%) of colloids and a high percentage (47.7-92.0%) of coarse particles (2-10 mu m) were present in the lowland well water. Hydraulic perturbation by rainwater infiltration in the sloping farmland was the dominant mechanism for colloid mobilization in general; this effect retreated to secondary importance behind chemical perturbations (pH, Mg2+ and DOC) at low flow discharges (<13 L/min). In contrast, water chemistry (e.g., EC, cations and DOC concentrations) exhibited a major effect on colloid dynamics in the water of the lowland wells, except for the extremely high-salinity water of one well, in which water temperature showed a negative dominant influence on colloid stability. The combined use of multiple parameters (e.g., mineral composition and organic matter, calcium carbonate and delta C-13 contents) traced groundwater colloids to the shallow soil in the upper farmlands. It is strongly advised that in finely fractured aquifers within agricultural catchments, not only the small colloids but also the coarse particles in the size range of 2 -10 mu m should be monitored in case of colloid-associated contamination from agricultural wastes e.g., N, P, pesticides and/or heavy metals, especially at the early stages of the rainy seasons.

AB The objective of this paper is to present the main results of an engineering-research project dealing with model-based evaluation of waste streams treatment from a biotech company. This has been extensively done in domestic treatment systems, but is equally important, and with different challenges in industrial wastewater treatment. A new set of biological (activated sludge, anaerobic digestion), physicochemical (aqueous phase, precipitation, mass transfer) process models and model interfaces are required to describe removal of organics in an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor plus either traditional nitrification/denitrification (A(1)) or partial nitritation (PN)/anammox (ANX) (A(2)) processes. Model-based analysis shows that option A(1) requires a decrease in digestion energy recovery (E-recovery) in order to have enough organic substrate for subsequent post NO3 reduction treatment (95 kWh.kg N-1). In contrast, A2 in an aerobic granular sludge reactor allows for higher UASB conversion since N removal is carried out autotrophically. The study also reveals that the addition of an aerated pre-treatment unit prior to the PN/ANX (A(2)) reactor promotes COD and H2S oxidation, CO2 and CH4 stripping, a pH increase (up to 8.5) and a reduction of the risk of intra-granular precipitation as well as sulfide inhibition. Simulations indicate clear differences regarding the microbial distribution/abundance within the biofilm in A(2) when comparing the two operational modes. Final results show the effects of different loading and operational conditions; dissolved oxygen (DO), Total Suspended Solids (TSSop), energy recovery (E-recovery); on the overall process performance; N removal, aeration energy (E-aeration), net energy production (E-recovery): using response surfaces, highlighting the need of integrated approaches to avoid sub-optimal outcomes. The study shows the benefits of virtual plant simulation and demonstrates the potential of model-based evaluation when process engineers in industry have to decide between competing options.

AB Recent studies have reported increased levels of Legionella pneumophila (Lp) at points of use compared to levels in primary and secondary components of hot water systems, suggesting possible selection by environmental conditions. In this study, concentrations of Lp in a hospital hot water system were evaluated by profile sampling, collecting successive water samples to determine the prevalence at the faucet (distal) and upstream piping before and after a system intervention to increase temperature. Lp strain diversity was compared between different points of use and different areas of the hot water system (i.e., tap, intermediate piping and main upflow piping). In total, 47 isolates were recovered from 32 positive hot water samples collected from designated taps, showers and recirculation loops; these isolates were subsequently analyzed by sequence-based typing (SBT). Lp levels were comparable between first draw (500 mL) and flushed (2 and 5 min) samples, whereas a decrease was observed in the amount of culturable cells (1 log). Two sequence types (STs) were identified throughout the system. ST378 (sg4/10) was present in 91% of samples, while ST154-like (sg1) was present in 41%; both STs were simultaneously recovered in 34% of samples. Isolated STs displayed comparable tolerance to copper (0.8 -5 mg/L) and temperature (55 degrees C, 1 h) exposure. The ability to replicate within THP1 cells and Acanthamoeba castellanii was similar between the two STs and a comparative environmental outbreak strain. The low Lp diversity and the detection of both Lp sequence types in repeated subsequent samples collected from positive faucets in a hospital wing suggest a minimal impact of the distal conditions on strain selection for the sampled points, as well as a possible adaptation to stressors present in the system, leading to the predominance of a few strains.

AB Chlorine is not effective in the oxidative removal of soluble manganese(11) ions at neutral pH. Powdered activated carbon (PAC) also has a very limited capacity for Mn(II) removal through adsorption in drinking water treatment practice. This study explored the combined use of PAC and chlorine for Mn(II) removal and found that PAC dramatically catalyzed Mn(II) oxidation by chlorine under diverse conditions. At a dose as low as 5.0 mg/I, two different commercial PACs increased Mn(II) oxidation rate by two orders of magnitude respectively and reduced Mn(11) concentration from 200 mu g/L to < 10 mu g/L in tens of minutes. First-order kinetics with respect to aqueous Mn(ll) concentration were observed. Typically, homogeneous Mn(11) oxidation by chlorine depends strongly on alkaline pH. In the presence of PAC, however, the reaction was still rather fast at pH 6.0. Increasing PAC doses linearly increased Mn(II) oxidation rate, indicating that the reaction was highly PAC surface active sites dependent. The efficacy of PAC was further corroborated in removing Mn(II) from natural water. SEM-EDS and XPS demonstrated that a MnO2 coating was formed on PAC surface after reaction, which resulted from heterogeneous oxidation of Mn(11) on PAC surface rather than the precipitation of Mn oxides formed through homogeneous oxidation in solution. Adsorption of free Mn(11) ions onto PAC surface was proved to directly correlate with Mn(II) oxidation rate. Two kinds of electron transfer pathways from adsorbed Mn(II) species to chlorine, enhanced by surface-complexation and electrically-conductive carbon surface respectively, were hypothesized.

AB Anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox), an important process for converting fixed nitrogen to N-2, plays an important role in the present-day marine nitrogen cycle. However, little is known about anammox activities in the past, especially in regions that were strongly affected by human activities, evidenced by eutrophication and hypoxia, which promote anammox bacteria growth. In this study, ladderanes have been measured in a sediment core and suspended particulate matter (SPM) in the East China Sea (ECS), to reconstruct the anammox record and to evaluate its responses to eutrophication and hypoxia. The detection and distribution of different ladderane lipids in SPM provide additional evidence that ladderanes were mostly produced in the water column and could reflect anammox activities. Summed ladderane content from the core varied between 11 and 300 ng/g dry weight (dw) sediment, with C20-[5]-ladderane fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) as the predominant compound (5-150 ng/g dw), followed by C20-[3]-ladderane FAME (1-110 ng/g dw), C18-[3]-ladderane FAME (1-32 ng/g dw) and 08 -[5]-ladderane FAME (3-11 ng/g dw). The detection of ladderanes over the last century indicate the existence of anammox in the past. The rapidly increasing trend of ladderanes since the 1960s correlates with an increase in phytoplankton biomarkers (2 Sigma(B + D + A), brassicasterol (B), dinosterol (D) and C-37 alkenones (A)), indicating that eutrophication exacerbated anammox growth. The co-variation between our ladderane record and published records of low-oxygen tolerant foraminiferal microfossils and hypoxia events over the past 60 years suggested that sediment ladderanes are a useful indicator for past changes of oxygen depletion or hypoxia in the ECS.

AB Aerobic granular sludge membrane bioreactor (AGMBR) has emerged with strong potential to overcome membrane fouling. There have been no extensive studies on extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) in AGMBR. The present work aimed at conducting an in-depth study of EPS and monitoring fouling development in AGMBR using a 2(2) factorial design having hydraulic retention time (HRT) and total organic carbon (TOC) as independent variables. HRT was tested at three levels of 6, 8 and 10 h while the TOC levels were 104 +/- 13, 189 +/- 17, and 266 +/- 27 mg/L. AGMBR exhibited high proteins (PN) in the tightly-bound EPS (TB-EPS) resulting in high proteins/polysaccharides (PN/PS) ratios of 2-16. The PN in the LB-EPS was low, ranging from 0.01 to 1.92 mg/g MLVSS, but the range of PN/PS ratio was also of 2-16. Despite the high PN/PS ratio, TMP rise was low. Water jet easily sloughed off the developed membrane cake layer. The elimination of chemicals for membrane cleaning has significant cost savings. TOC had a significant main effect on both the PN and PS components of TB-EPS at alpha < 0.05. TB-EPS PN increased with increase in TOC. TB-EPS PN decreased as HRT increased from 6 h to 10 hat 104 +/- 13 mg/L TOC but the change of HRT from 10 h to 6 hat 266 +/- 27 mg/L TOC did not affect TB-EPS PN. The TMP increased with increasing HRT at 104 13 and 266 +/- 27 mg/L TOC. An increase in sEPS PN correlated well with increase in membrane fouling (r = 0.581). Three runs performed best: 266 +/- 27 mg/L TOC and 10 h HRT; 104 +/- 13 mg/L TOC and 6 h HRT; and 266 +/- 27 mg/L TOC and 6 h HRT as TMP was below the 50 kPa threshold. AGMBR achieved 98 +/- 1%, 99 +/- 1%, 52 +/- 33% organics degradation, NH3-N removal, total nitrogen removal, respectively. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In boreal regions, increased concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) have been linked to extreme wet years; however, less is known about the extent to which precipitation events are altering DOC concentration and quality. We assessed the effects of rain events on a suite of six lakes in Maine, U.S.A., to better understand how events alter DOC quantity and quality. DOC concentrations and DOC quality (measured as DOC-specific absorption coefficients (Specific Ultraviolet Absorbance (SUVA(254) (also a(254)*). a(320)*, and a(380)*)) were quantified 24 h before, and at three time points (24-48 h, 5-7 days, and 3 weeks) after five different precipitation events. Our results revealed three types of responses across the lakes: (1) an initial spike in DOC concentrations of 30-133% and in the three quality metrics of 20-86% compared to pre-storm levels, followed by return to pre-storm concentrations; (2) a sustained increase in DOC concentrations (by 4-23%) and an increase in the three DOC quality metrics (by 1-43%) through the second post-storm sampling, with concentrations falling by the third post-storm sampling compared to pre-storm levels; and (3) no change during all sampling periods. Lake residence time was a key driver of changes in DOC concentration and DOC quality in response to storm events. Our research provides evidence that precipitation events contribute to short-term abrupt changes in DOC quantity and quality that are largely driven by key landscape and lake characteristics. These changes in DOC may have important implications for management of water utilities, including alteration or implementation of treatment strategies. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This work aimed to evaluate the ability of four regulatory sampling protocols to accurately determine weekly water lead levels (WLLs) of exposure at the kitchen tap in twenty-nine households with or without a lead service line (LSL). Proportional sampling was used as the gold standard to which the other protocols, 5-min flush, 30-min stagnation, 6-h stagnation and random daytime were compared. Random daytime samples provided mean WLLs closest to true exposure in the households monitored overall compared to other sampling protocols. Strikingly, mean WLLs after 5 min of flushing underestimated lead exposure by 47%. Supporting these observations, water usage patterns revealed that full flushing only occurs in 3.4% of usage events within the service line and in 0.26% at the tap. The time between usage events in the service line was approximately 30 min but the 30-min protocol tended to slightly underestimate WLLs. These differences were explained by flushing prior to the 30-min stagnation sampling, which limited the contribution of the LSL to WLLs. Furthermore, the average stagnation at the kitchen time was 106 min and usage events rarely exceeded the water volume within premise plumbing (1.1 L). Mean WLLs after 6 h of stagnation without flushing overestimated exposure by 29% but provided a conservative indicator of WLLs of exposure. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Nitrifying biologically active filters (BAFs) have been found to be high emitters of nitrous oxide (N2O), a powerful greenhouse gas contributing to ozone layer depletion. While recent models have greatly improved our understanding of the triggers of N2O emissions from suspended-growth processes, less is known about N2O emissions from full-scale biofilm processes.
   Tertiary nitrifying BAFs have been modeled at some occasions but considering strong simplifications on the description of gas-liquid exchanges which are not appropriate for N2O prediction. In this work, a tertiary nitrifying BAF model including the main N2O biological pathways was developed and confronted to full-scale data from Seine Aval, the largest wastewater resource recovery facility in Europe. A mass balance on the gaseous compounds was included in order to correctly describe the N2O gas-liquid partition, thus N2O emissions. Preliminary modifications of the model structure were made to include the gas phase as a compartment of the model, which significantly affected the prediction of nitrification. In particular, considering gas hold-up influenced the prediction of the hydraulic retention time, thus nitrification performances: a 3.5% gas fraction reduced ammonium removal by 13%, as the liquid volume, small in such systems, is highly sensitive to the gas presence. Finally, the value of the volumetric oxygen transfer coefficient was adjusted to successfully predict both nitrification and N2O emissions. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The large volumes of oily wastewater generated by various industries, such as oil and gas, food and beverage, and metal processing, need to be de-oiled prior to being discharged into the environment. Compared to conventional technologies such as dissolved air flotation (DAF), coagulation or solvent extraction, membrane filtration can treat oily wastewater of a much broader compositional range and still ensure high oil removals. In the present review, various aspects related to the practical implementation of membranes for the treatment of oily wastewater are summarized. First, sources and composition of oily wastewater, regulations that stipulate the extent of treatment needed before discharge, and the conventional technologies that enable such treatment are appraised. Second, commercially available membranes, membrane modules, operation modes and hybrids are overviewed, and their economics are discussed. Third, challenges associated with membrane filtration are examined, along with means to quantify and mitigate membrane fouling. Finally, perspectives on state-of-the-art techniques to facilitate better monitoring and control of such systems are briefly discussed. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Adaption to adverse environments plays an important role in bacterial survival and is receiving increasing globe attention now. Here, cultivable chlorine-injured Pseudomonas aeruginosa, produced on the chlorination process, was investigated about their resistance to antibiotics. Then, global transcriptional analyses, quantitative PCR (qPCR) validation and antioxidant enzymes measurement were performed to explore the underlying mechanisms. The results showed that chlorine injury enhanced antibiotic resistance in P. aeruginosa and cultivable chlorine-injured P. aeruginosa exposed to 4 mg/L sodium hypochlorite (half of the lethal dose) improved antibiotic resistance against ceftazidime, chloramphenicol and ampicillin by 1.4-5.6 fold. This increase in antibiotic resistance was not hereditable and over expression of the MexEF-OprN efflux pump resulting from oxidative stress contributed to it. These results demonstrate temporal physiological persistence to antibiotics in cultivable chlorine-injured pathogens, suggesting their survival from adverse environments with antibiotic exposure and thereby posing lasting hazards to human health.

AB Widespread chemical contamination represents one of the largest threats of the Anthropocene. The Pesticide in Water Calculator (PWC) is a fate and transport model used by the Environmental Protection Agency and Health Canada to estimate pesticide exposures in lentic freshwater ecosystems and make pesticide registration decisions. Here, we show that maximum measured concentrations of 31% of herbicides and 42% of insecticides exceeded maximum estimated environmental concentrations (EECs) produced by the PWC, suggesting that EECs often do not represent worst-case exposure as they have been purported to do. Based on this observation, we generated statistical models using EECs and over 600,000 field measurements of 31 common insecticides and herbicides to document if the congruence of EECs and maximum field measurements could be improved by accounting for environmental sampling effort (number of times a pesticide is sampled) and contaminant application, factors commonly ignored in most fate and transport models. For lentic systems, variance in pesticide field measurements explained by EECs increased by 50% when sampling effort was included. For lotic systems, variance explained increased by only 4%, most likely because lotic systems are sampled over 4.9 times as much as lentic systems. Including use more than doubled the ability of the EECs to predict maximum pesticides concentrations in lentic systems. Our results suggest that exposure characterization in risk assessment can likely be improved by considering sampling effort and use, thus providing more defensible environmental standards and regulations.

AB The implementation, operation and decommissioning of stormwater management systems causes environmental damage, while at the same time reducing pollutant loads in receiving waters by treating stormwater. The focus in research has been either on assessing impacts caused by stormwater infrastructure, or risks associated with stormwater discharges, but rarely have these two sources of environmental impacts been combined to allow a comprehensive environmental evaluation of stormwater management. We assess the environmental sustainability of four different generic stormwater management systems for a catchment of 260ha by a) modelling the flow of pollutants in stormwater, and resulting point source emissions to freshwater, and b) quantifying emissions and resources for all relevant processes associated with the life cycle of the infrastructure. Using life cycle impact assessment, we quantify the resulting environmental impacts and consequent damage to two areas of protection ecosystems (expressed in time-integrated species loss) and natural resource availability (expressed in extra costs for future resource extraction). Our assessment shows that combined stormwater management causes the highest damage to both ecosystems (1.4E-03 species.yr/yr) and resource availability (8.8E+03 USD/yr). Separate systems using only green infrastructure were found to avoid damage to resource availability (-3.7 to -5.2 USD/yr) and cause lower ecosystem damage (1.1-1.3E-03 species.yr/yr). Stormwater discharges contribute significantly to the total ecosystem damage of the different systems (36-88%), and the sustainability of separate systems can be further improved by optimizing the removal efficiency of low-tech elements like surface basins and filter soil. The systems are designed according to engineering standards. Choosing different criteria, e.g. identical flood safety levels, would result in substantial changes of the relative performance of the systems. The findings highlight the importance of including point source emissions into the assessment to allow comparative conclusions and minimisation of environmental damage of stormwater management.

AB Most Great Lakes communities rely on culture-based E. coil methods for monitoring fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) at recreational beaches. These cultivation methods require 18 or more hours to generate results. As a consequence, public notifications about beach action value (BAV) exceedance are based on prior-day water quality. Rapid qPCR monitoring of bacteria in beach water solves the 24-h delay problem, though the USEPA-approved qPCR method targets enterococci bacteria, while Great Lakes communities are familiar with E. coil monitoring. For an E. coil qPCR method to be useful for water quality management, it is important to systematically characterize method performance, and establish BAVs for public notification purposes. In this study, we 1) evaluated a draft USEPA E. coli qPCR method, 2) compared E. coli qPCR measurements with two established FIB (E. coli culture and enterococci qPCR) results, and explored potential strategies to establish E. coil qPCR BAV criteria in the absence of an epidemiological study. Based on analyses of 288 water samples collected from eight of Chicago's Lake Michigan beaches, the E. coli qPCR method demonstrates acceptable performance characteristics. The method is prone to low level DNA contamination, possibly originating from assay reagents derived from E. coli bacteria. Both E. coli and enterococci BAVs were exceeded in approximately 18% of the samples. E. coli qPCR values were correlated with both E. coli culture (r = 0.83; p < 0.0001) and enterococci qPCR (r = 0.67; p < 0.0001) values. The approach recommended by the USEPA in its Technical Support Material (TSM) was used to generate candidate E. coli qPCR BAVs, as was receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Potential BAV thresholds differed substantially, ranging from 200.9 calibrator cell equivalents (CCE)/100 mL (ROC analysis, enterococci qPCR BAV as the reference) to 1000 CCE/100 mL (TSM analysis, enterococci qPCR BAV as the reference). Because we found that different approaches to establishing potential BAVs generate quite different values, guidance from USEPA about approaches to defining comparable BAVs would be useful.

AB Over the last years, the human probable carcinogen 1,4-dioxane and alkyl-1,3-dioxanes and dioxolanes have been detected and identified as the cause of several pollution episodes in the Llobregat River (Catalonia, NE Spain) and its aquifer. It is an issue of major concern to study these compounds which are released to the environment by resin manufacturing plants' spills and wastewater discharges spread along rivers and reach drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs) in order to protect the environment and public health. In this study four seasonal sampling campaigns were carried out over a year to determine the removal efficiency of the dioxanes and dioxolanes at each step of a DWTP including ozonation, granular activated carbon filters, ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis step's treatments. Additionally, a weekly sampling monitoring of 1,4-dioxane and alkyl-1,3-dioxanes and dioxolanes in raw water, groundwater and finished water was performed at a DWTP over more than two years. Aqueous odor concentration thresholds (OTCs) were established by the three-alternative forced choice method (3-AFC).
   Following a previous published methodology, samples were analyzed and results showed that the advanced treatment (Ultrafiltration followed by reverse osmosis) line removes more efficiently 1,4-dioxane, alkyl dioxanes and dioxolanes (80 +/- 6% for 1,4-dioxane, 97 +/- 7% for 5,5-DMD and 100 +/- 0% for 2,5,5-TMD) than the upgraded conventional treatment line (ozonation followed by granular activated carbon filters) (-12 +/- 50%, 25 +/- 62% and 50 +/- 51% respectively), where some desorption processes were eventually observed. From the monitoring study, results suggest that the presence of 1,4-dioxane is not only due to spills, but also from other sources of contamination. Whereas dioxolanes almost completely disappeared in time, 1,4-dioxane's concentrations remained low and fluctuant. A background concentration of 1,4-dioxane in surface waters (similar to 1 mu g/L) has been determined with a relevant concentration up to 11.6 mu g/L of 1,4-dioxane in groundwater.
   The perception values for some of the studied compounds were extremely low (few ng/L only), which confirms the relevancy of this group of compounds as malodorous agents in waters. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study focused on evaluating the use of powdered activated carbon (PAC) adsorption for the treat ability of various odor compounds with different structures. The adsorption performance of 14 odor compounds under various PAC dosages were fitted with two isotherm models (the Langmuir and Freundlich models) to evaluate the adsorption ability. The results indicated that the adsorption capacities estimated from isotherm model predictions were not suitable for the evaluation of treatability of the odor compound due to the neglection of odor threshold. A novel assessment method, through the comparison of the residual concentration at an inflection point (where the downward trend of the odor compound residual concentration and PAC dosage curve starts to flatten) and the corresponding threshold concentration, was employed. This assessment method considered the different thresholds of the various odor compounds and their absorbability by PAC as well as the cost. The results indicated that only the sulfur odor compounds, including dimethyl disulfide, diethyl disulfide and dimethyl trisulfide, were not suitable for PAC treatment. Other odor compounds could be treated by PAC with varying success. The correlations between the adsorption capacity and the treatability of various odor compounds and their properties, including the coefficient between octanol and water (LogK(w)), solubility, molar refractivity (MR), dipole and volume, were also evaluated using the Pearson and Spearman correlation analysis. The results indicated that there were not significant correlations between the adsorption capacity and the properties of the odor compounds, while there were significant correlations between the treatability and LogK(w), MR and volume. The odor causing compound with a larger LogK(w), MR and volume was more suitable to be treated by PAC. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Membrane separation technology is an important option for the treatment of contaminated surface waters but the relatively high cost of materials and membrane fabrication represent a significant obstacle to the wider use of membrane processes. In this study, we describe the development and testing of a new kind of membrane made from two-dimensional (2D) kaolin nanosheets. The fabrication involved a layer by-layer stacking of the nanosheets with a cationic polyacrylamide cross-linking agent, assembled on a cellulose acetate supporting layer. The kaolin membrane exhibited an ultrahigh flux (similar to 4000 Lm-(2).h(-1).bar(-1)) which was almost ten times greater than that of a commercial polyether sulfone (PES) ultrafiltration (UF) membrane. The membrane was tested using a range of influent water types, including samples of a lake water, river water and three natural organic matter solutions. The results showed that the kaolin membrane was stable and behaved as an UF membrane, in terms of its pore size distribution (peak distribution at 20-35 nm) and comparable treatment performance to the PES UF membrane. The kaolin membrane showed a substantially reduced rate of fouling, compared to PES membrane, despite a much greater flux, which was partly attributed to its highly hydrophilic nature. The advantages of lower cost, much higher flux and lower fouling propensity make the 2D-kaolin membrane a potentially important development in UF membrane technology for drinking water treatment, and possibly other applications.

AB Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was used to investigate how the crude glycerin concentration and the carbon to nitrogen (C:N) ratio in the culture medium affect four indicators of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) accumulation by mixed microbial cultures (MMC): the observed coefficient of active-biomass yield (Y-obs,Y-BA), the observed coefficient of PHA yield (Y-obs,Y-PHA), the PHA content in biomass (X-PHA) and the volumetric productivity (Pr-V). The C:N ratio had the largest effect on Y-obs,Y-BA and Y-obs,Y-PHA. When the C:N ratio was increased, Y-obs,Y-BA decreased and Y-obs,Y-PHA increased, regardless of the concentration of crude glycerin in the culture medium. The C:N ratio also had the largest effect on the PHA content, whereas volumetric productivity was strongly affected by both the C:N ratio and the crude glycerin concentration. The optimal conditions for PHA accumulation were a crude glycerin concentration of 8954 mg COD/L with a C:N ratio of 15.9 mg ping N-NH4, which gave a Y-obs,Y-BA of 0.29 mg CODBA/mg COD, a Y-obs,Y-PHA of 0.28 mg CODPHA/mg COD, a X-PHA of 55.6% VSS and a P-V of 757.3 mg CODPHA/L.d (550.0 mg PHA/L.d). The accumulated PHAs consisted mainly of 3-hydroxybutyrate. By using RSM, it was possible to predict crude glycerin concentrations and C:N ratios not tested here that will allow desirable values of PHA content in biomass or PHA productivity, which can be useful for designing PHA production with MMC.

AB Rheological properties are important in the design and operation of sludge-handling process. Despite this, the rheology of sludge in thermal hydrolysis processes (TH) is not well described.
   In-situ measurements were performed to characterize the flow behaviour of various concentrations (7-13 wt%) of waste activated sludge (WAS) at TH conditions. Equations were presented for predicting in situ rheological parameters (high-shear viscosity, eta(infinity,i), consistency index, k(i), and yield stress, sigma(c,i)) under various treatment conditions, which are useful for design of process units. The equations enable convenient estimation of in-situ properties based on ambient rheological measurements. Results suggested that the proportion of sludge solubilization and its rate were unaffected by varying sludge concentration.
   Thermally treated sludge still exhibited gel-like, viscoelastic characteristics similar to untreated sludge; however, the storage (G') and loss (G '') moduli decreased with higher treatment temperatures. Frequency and creep responses were described by a fractional derivatives Kelvin-Voigt (FKV) model, which showed increasing viscous characteristics of treated sludge. These equations can be utilised in CFD models. Results obtained from oscillatory measurements can also approximate steady-shear behaviour by comparing dynamic viscosity, eta'(omega), and steady-shear viscosity, eta(gamma'), whose values were very similar. This enables convenient estimation of steady-shear behaviour of sludge from oscillatory measurements, which is found to be a non-destructive technique for measuring flow behaviour of highly concentrated sludge. Yield stress can also be predicted from the product of modified Cox-Merz shift factors and storage modulus (G'). Practical engineering implications of the rheological observations were discussed.

AB There is growing interest in the application of rapid quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and other PCR-based methods for recreational water quality monitoring and management programs. This interest has strengthened given the publication of U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-validated qPCR methods for enterococci fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) and has extended to similar methods for Escherichia coli (E. coli) FIB. Implementation of qPCR-based methods in monitoring programs can be facilitated by confidence in the quality of the data produced by these methods. Data quality can be determined through the establishment of a series of specifications that should reflect good laboratory practice. Ideally, these specifications will also account for the typical variability of data coming from multiple users of the method. This study developed proposed standardized data quality acceptance criteria that were established for important calibration model parameters and/or controls from a new qPCR method for E. coli (EPA Draft Method C) based upon data that was generated by 21 laboratories. Each laboratory followed a standardized protocol utilizing the same prescribed reagents and reference and control materials. After removal of outliers, statistical modeling based on a hierarchical Bayesian method was used to establish metrics for assay standard curve slope, intercept and lower limit of quantification that included between-laboratory, replicate testing within laboratory, and random error variability. A nested analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to establish metrics for calibrator/positive control, negative control, and replicate sample analysis data. These data acceptance criteria should help those who may evaluate the technical quality of future findings from the method, as well as those who might use the method in the future. Furthermore, these benchmarks and the approaches described for determining them may be helpful to method users seeking to establish comparable laboratory-specific criteria if changes in the reference and/or control materials must be made.

AB There is interest in the application of rapid quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) methods for recreational freshwater quality monitoring of the fecal indicator bacteria Escherichia coli (E. coli). In this study we determined the performance of 21 laboratories in meeting proposed, standardized data quality acceptance (QA) criteria and the variability of target gene copy estimates from these laboratories in analyses of 18 shared surface water samples by a draft qPCR method developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for E. coli. The participating laboratories ranged from academic and government laboratories with more extensive qPCR experience to "new" water quality and public health laboratories with relatively little previous experience in most cases. Failures to meet QA criteria for the method were observed in 24% of the total 376 test sample analyses. Of these failures, 39% came from two of the "new" laboratories. Likely factors contributing to QA failures included deviations in recommended procedures for the storage and preparation of reference and control materials. A master standard curve calibration model was also found to give lower overall variability in log(10) target gene copy estimates than the delta-delta Ct (Delta Delta Ct) calibration model used in previous EPA qPCR methods. However, differences between the mean estimates from the two models were not significant and variability between laboratories was the greatest contributor to overall method variability in either case. Study findings demonstrate the technical feasibility of multiple laboratories implementing this or other qPCR water quality monitoring methods with similar data quality acceptance criteria but suggest that additional practice and/or assistance may be valuable, even for some more generally experienced qPCR laboratories. Special attention should be placed on providing and following explicit guidance on the preparation, storage and handling of reference and control materials. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Salinity gradient heat engines represent an innovative and promising way to convert low-grade heat into electricity by employing salinity gradient technology in a closed-loop configuration. Among the aqueous solutions which can be used as working fluid, ammonium bicarbonate-water solutions appear very promising due to their capability to decompose at low temperature. In this work, an experimentally validated model for a reverse electrodialysis heat engine fed with ammonium bicarbonate-water solutions was developed. The model consists of two validated sub-models purposely integrated, one for the reverse electrodialysis unit and the other for the stripping/absorption regeneration unit. The impact of using current commercial membranes and future enhanced membranes on the efficiency of the system was evaluated, along with the effect of operating and design parameters through sensitivity analyses. Results indicated that exergy efficiency up to 8.5% may be obtained by considering enhanced future membranes and multi-column regeneration units.

AB In the current work a new thermocline combined sensible-latent heat thermal energy storage configuration is proposed as an alternative to the currently used thermal storage systems; containing solid rod structures of cheap naturally occurring material with phase change material capsules impregnated between the rods. An energy balance method coupled with an enthalpy based technique are used to develop a comprehensive transient numerical model. The numerical simulations are performed to compare the performance and the cost of the three types of thermal energy storage systems. The three thermal energy storage systems are; sensible rod structure, encapsulated phase change material and combined sensible-latent heat. The influence of different evaluation indexes on economic feasibility and the performance of thermal energy storage such as capital cost, capacity cost per kWh, axial temperature distribution, pumping work, thermocline degradation, effective discharging time and effective discharging efficiency; are analyzed. The results show that effective discharging efficiency and capacity costs for encapsulated phase change material, combined sensible-latent heat, sensible rod structure are 95%, 87%, 76% and $42/kWh, $37/kWh, $35/kWh, respectively, Moreover, the hybrid configuration exhibits a storage capacity of 78.5 kWh/m(3), which is 26% higher than sensible rod structure and 22% lower than encapsulated phase change material configuration. The results of the comparative study indicate that the combined sensible-latent heat TES system seems to be a more viable option among the considered configurations due to its optimized performance and comparatively low cost. Also due to the reasons that thermal ratcheting of the storage tank is avoided and it provides stable fluid outlet temperature.

AB Catalyst layer structural changes in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells have significant impact on the cell performance and durability. In this study, ex-situ experiments are designed to investigate the effect of humidity and/or thermal cycles on the structural changes of catalyst layers. The relative humidity and temperature are controlled by an environmental chamber and the catalyst layer structure is characterized by scanning electron microscopy and optical microscopy. The experimental results indicate that crack growth and development, catalyst agglomerate detachment, and surface bulges are the main structural changes of the catalyst layers. Applying relative humidity and thermal cycling simultaneously causes the most significant crack growth, while applying thermal cycling alone causes no appreciable changes. This indicates that the absolute humidity is the key parameter for the crack growth. Through cyclic voltammetry analysis, it is shown that the electrochemical active surface area decreases from 64.1 m(2) g(-1) to 49.1 m(2) g(-1) after 500 combined relative humidity and thermal cycles. Analyses of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy show that the charge transfer resistance and ohmic resistance increase significantly after 500 combined relative humidity and thermal cycles, causing the cell performance degradation.

AB This paper details an extensive experimental investigation of a novel throughflow micro-wave rotor with symmetrically cambered passage profiles designed for shaft power output as well as pressure exchange. This is the first time comprehensive experimental data from a power generating wave rotor is presented in a peer-reviewed journal. Moreover, the significance and renewed interest in wave rotors for a wide range of applications from refrigeration to micro-gas turbines makes this experimental programme extremely valuable to many fields of research.
   The wave rotor is a four port, three-cycle unit of 60 mm in diameter, 30 mm in length and houses 46 channels. The unit was experimentally tested on a gas stand in open-loop configuration using electrical heaters as a source of heat for the high pressure inlet and pressurised air for both inlet ducts. Throughout testing, the mass flow rates among high pressure in- and outlet were balanced.
   A series of tests were conducted investigating the effect of variation in rotational speed, ratio of inlet mass flow rates (loop flow ratio), axial clearances and peak inlet temperature on wave rotor performance. The results show the importance of minimum axial clearance for maximum energy transfer as well as for reduced mixing of hot and cold flows. The competing relationship between pressure ratio, high pressure zone pressure difference, internal exhaust gas recirculation and fresh air exhaustion is also highlighted. Finally, measurements of the temperature distributions in the high pressure outflow show the effect of rotational speed, loop flow ratio and centrifugal forces on the fresh air stream location and its mixing with the hot gas stream.
   A peak shaft power of 450 W and a peak pressure ratio of approximately 1.63 were obtained close to the design speed that were in line with expectations for clearances and temperatures under investigation. Using a new approach to calculating efficiency that assumes equal values for expansion and compression, a peak figure of 80% was obtained indicating the superiority that such designs have over similarly sized traditional turbo machinery.

AB The objective of this work was to design, simulate and evaluate the performance of an innovative hybrid vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT) for obtaining an extended operational range and enhancing self-starting capabilities. An extensive research was conducted to explore the design parameters for obtaining an optimum novel hybrid VAWT configuration. The hybrid VAWT consisting of a 2-bladed modified Savonius Bach-type rotor and a 3-bladed Darrieus turbine was modeled and analyzed in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to calculate the characteristic parameters of the rotor system. The geometry was then used to generate the grid in ANSYS Meshing for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analyses to evaluate the performance of the designed hybrid VAWT. Results indicated that while the Darrieus turbine had the highest coefficient of power (C-p) of 48.4% at a TSR of 2.50, it suffered from high start-up torque requirements. The hybrid turbine demonstrated self-starting capabilities while reaching a maximum C-p of 41.4% at a TSR of 2.5 and operation up to a TSR value of 4.5. When compared to previous hybrid VAWT designs, the proposed configuration demonstrated improvements to the efficiency and operational range which support the energy sustainability prospects.

AB A novel variable pH control operation strategy was developed for maximizing energy and resource recovery from food waste by integrating the ultra-fast hydrolysis and lipid fermentation. Food waste after fast hydrolyzed by homemade hydrolytic enzymes, the separated solids can be directly applied as biofertilizer, while the liquor was used for microbial lipid production with oleaginous yeast Rhodosporidium toruloides 2.1389. A novel variable pH control strategy was thus developed for enhanced lipid production. As such, a lipid yield of 11.10 g/kg food waste was obtained, which contained about 5% of highly value-added docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). The residual soluble COD (SCOD) after lipid fermentation was used as organic source for further biomethane production by anaerobic digestion with a biomethane yield of 0.287 L CH4/g SCOD removed. According to these results, it was estimated that about 7713 tonnes of biodiesel and 422 tonnes of high-value DHA could be produced yearly from Singapore's food waste, together with 32,392 tonnes of dry biofertilizer and 6.48 x 10(6) m(3) of methane gas. Compared to the conventional lipid based-biodiesel production, the total economic revenue could be increased by a factor of 2.03 by adopting the proposed variable pH control strategy due to the high commercial value of DHA. It is expected that the approach developed in this study can open a new window for future food waste management.

AB Large solar collector fields are very popular in district heating system in Denmark, even though the solar radiation source is not favorable at high latitudes compared to many other regions. Business models for large solar heating plants in Denmark has attracted much attention worldwide. Denmark is not only the biggest country in both total installed capacities and numbers of large solar district heating plants, but also is the first and only country with commercial market-driven solar district heating plants. By the end of 2017, more than 1.3 million m(2) solar district heating plants are in operation in Denmark. Furthermore, more than 70% of the large solar district heating plants worldwide are constructed in Denmark. Based on the case of Denmark, this study reviews the development of large solar district heating plants in Denmark since 2006. Success factors for Danish experiences was summarized and discussed. Novel design concepts of large solar district heating plants are also addressed to clarify the future development trend. Potential integration of large solar district heating plants with other renewable energy technologies are discussed. This paper can provide references to potential countries that want to exploit the market for solar district heating plants. Policy-makers can evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of solar district heating systems in the national energy planning level based on the know-how and experiences from Denmark.

AB The objective of this study was to build an efficient outer-inner looping redox reaction mechanism called steam recycled biomass chemical looping gasification (SR-BCLG) for H-2 production by using BaFe2O4 as an oxygen carrier (OC). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) results showed the phase changes of BaFe2O4 in the SR-BCLG process can be oxidized to its initial state stimulated by steam. In addition, the impacts on the temperature, water injection rate (steam/biomass ratio) and OC loading were investigated. The maximum H-2 production of 28.5 mol/kg(.) biomass was achieved in the 60 min of gasification with a BaFe2O4 load amount of 10 wt%, which is an increase in H-2 production of 109.6% compared with the no-OC biomass gasification process under the optimal conditions. Durative high production of H-2-enriched syngas was obtained during the cyclic stability tests, indicating the significant redox durability and high H-2-generation properties of BaFe2O4. The XRD, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and thermo-gravimetric analyzer (TG) characterizations revealed the high stability of BaFe2O4, which can be ascribed to the existence of Ba2+. The bimetal functional BaFe2O4 allows for an innovative method of outer-inner looping redox reactions for continuous H-2-enriched syngas generation in the SR-BCLG process.

AB In this study, thermo-ecology based performance investigations for a combined system consists of Brayton gas cycle, Rankine mercury cycle and Rankine steam cycle, which is called Gas/Mercury/Steam power generation system (GMSPGS), are carried out depending on the most used performance characteristics such as power generation, density of power generation, destructed exergy, second law efficiency (exergetic performance efficiency) with respect to destructed exergy and power generation, ECOP and EFECPOD. The impacts of system design and operating parameters for gas cycle part, mercury cycle part and steam cycle part on the performance characteristics are parametrically examined in detailed. The used parameters are inlet temperature and pressure of the air, mass flow rate of the air, pressure ratio, equivalence ratio, turbine speed, residual gas fraction (RGF), mercury temperature of the gas-mercury heat exchanger (GM-HEX), low-pressure mercury turbine (LPMT), medium-pressure mercury turbine (MPMT), high-pressure mercury turbine (HPMT), steam temperature at the mercury-steam heat exchanger (MS-HEX), the pressures of low-pressure steam turbine (LPST), medium-pressure steam turbine (MPST), high-pressure steam turbine (HPST), open feed water heater (OFWH) and condenser (COND). The results demonstrated that the performance specifications are substantially affected by the component properties. Beside the theoretical model examined in the paper, a data obtained from artificial neural networks (ANNs) is also presented to model the system. It is shown that a limited number of parameters is enough for good approximations.

AB To closely reflect the actual working condition of CCHP-GSHP system, the aim of this study is to propose an off-design optimization model of the CCHP-GSHP coupled system considering carbon tax. In the optimal model, there are 13 decision variables containing rated capacity of power generation unit (1 decision variable) and the system monthly energy ratios (12 decision variables); energy criteria, environment criteria and economy criteria (considering carbon tax) are combined together as optimization objective. A hybrid particle swarm optimization is used to solve the model. A case study is realized to demonstrate the optimization model. The results of this study show that the CCHP-GSHP system has better performance compared with the reference system (annual energy consumption saving ratio is 31.79%; annual carbon dioxide emission reduction ratio is 51.34%; annual total cost reduction ratio is 25.64%; optimization objective is 36.26%). The sensitivity analysis of the electricity and natural gas price is taken into consideration in the end.

AB The present research work focused towards the utilization of Musa acuminata Colla 'Red' banana peduncle for the development of a novel, low-cost, green, and highly efficient heterogeneous catalyst for the conversion of Ceiba pentandra oil (CPO) into C. pentandra methyl esters (CPME). The calcined red banana peduncle (CRBP) was characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), and techniques. BET analysis revealed that the catalyst surface area was 45.99 m(2) g(-1) with pore diameter of 9.77 nm. EDS analysis on CRBP showed the presence of various minerals and potassium was found to be the major active ingredient responsible for high catalytic activity. The biodiesel production process parameters such as CRBP concentration (1.5-3.5 wt%), methanol to esterified CPO (E-CPO) molar ratio (6:1-14:1), and transesterification time (40-120 min) was optimized using central composite design (CCD) based response surface methodology (RSM). Among the three parameters studied, CRBP concentration was found to be the most significant parameter in maximizing the CPME conversion since it exhibited huge multi-minerals and high surface area. A maximum experimental CPME conversion of 98.73 +/- 0.50% was achieved at the process conditions of 2.68 wt% CRBP concentration, 11.46 methanol to E-CPO molar ratio, and 106 min transesterification time while the temperature and stirrer speed was maintained at 65 degrees C and 450 rpm respectively. Also, the properties of synthesized CPME were evaluated and the studies on catalyst reusability were also performed.

AB Tubular solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) can be applied in a diverse range of applications, such as critical military missions, auxiliary power units, and portable power generators. In particular, portable power-generation devices may have to meet the requirements of rapid start-up, thermally self-sustaining operation, high thermal shock resistance, and high power density relative to the weight. This work presents the design and performance of a tubular SOFC stack integrated with a hybrid catalytic partial oxidation (CPDX) reformer, an afterburner (A/B), and a heat exchanger (HEX), which enables the stack operation without any external heat source with propane as a fuel. The SOFC stack that was made with four anode-supported tubular SOFCs was assembled with fuel and air chambers The hybrid COPX reformer that was fed with a pre-mixture of propane and air acted as a start-up burner at the initial period operation to heat the stack up and then a reformer to provide a syngas to the stack when it reached an elevated temperature (700-800 degrees C). The A/B also provided heat energy to the stack by oxidizing the unreacted fuel and air of the stack anode and cathode exhaust, respectively. The stack first underwent a pre-treatment which reduced the anode support in a programmable furnace. The preliminary electrochemical performance of the stack was assessed while feeding a mixture gas of H-2 and N-2 as the fuel. Next, the pre-treated stack was integrated with the hybrid reformer, A/B, and HEX and insulated to investigate the thermally self-sustaining rapid operation capabilities by using propane as the fuel. In the integrated SOFC system, the stack reached 780 degrees C within an hour upon operation and generated 12 W of output power, thus demonstrating the feasibility of the system for portable power generations.

AB Based on pyrolysis technology, natural rubber can be converted to gases of high calorific value and then be used as fuels. In order to further explain the generation mechanisms of natural rubber pyrolysis gas, a combination of reaction molecular dynamics (RMD) simulations and thermogravimetry-infrared spectroscopy (TG-FTIR) experiments were used to study the pyrolysis process. The results show that the pyrolysis gases include CH4, C2H4 and a small amount of C3H6 and C4H6. The TG-FTIR also shows the presence of CH4 and functional groups (-C-H, -CH2, -CH3 and -C=C-) in C2H4, C3H6 and C4H8. The kinetics data of each reaction which obtained based on the chain reaction mechanism and transition state theory, were input into Aspen Plus process simulations to further get reasonable reaction path. The simulation results show that CH3 separated from the main chain abstracts H from other molecules to generate CH4, while C2H4 is mainly generated by the breaking of C-C bonds on long chains. Other small gas molecules are generated by the breaking up of large olefins or free radicals with low activity. This study provides a theoretical basis for the recycling of pyrolysis gas and may ultimately help to increase the energy efficiency of the pyrolysis process.

AB LNG re-gasification process usually occurs through heat exchange with seawater, causing a large amount of exergy destruction. However, in this study, this process is employed as the heat sink of a geothermal driven multi-generation system. Because of the high temperature difference between the heat source (geothermal fluid) and the heat sink (LNG re-gasification process), a cascade of two organic Rankine cycles is placed between them. The system also includes an absorption refrigeration cycle and a PEM electrolyzer to form an efficient multi generation system. A comprehensive analysis is carried out to assess the performance of the system both thermodynamically and economically. Furthermore, the paper presents a parametric study to illustrate the influences of major parameters on the system performance. To simultaneously optimize total cost rate, hydrogen production capacity, and exergy efficiency of the system, a multi-objective optimization procedure is developed (through coupling Genetic Algorithm with Artificial Neural Network) and applied to the system. Consequently, a system design with a total cost rate of 423.5 ($/hr), hydrogen production capacity of 276.1 (kg/hr), and exergy efficiency of 24.92% is obtained as the optimal solution. The proposed system shows great improvements in cooling, power generation, and hydrogen production capacities compared to literature.

AB Liquid water distribution inside PEM fuel cell is investigated via interactive combination of CFD analysis and neutron imaging on a single 100 cm(2) PEM fuel cell. The analysis is conducted with novel anode flow field designed for improved liquid water removal from the cell at higher currents. Numerical and experimental results show good agreement due to the incorporated experimental structural parameters for the membrane-electrode assembly and properly defined membrane water content parameters in conjunction with electro-osmotic drag and back-diffusion expressions in the numerical model. Methodology for achieving such accurate results is shown in detail in this work and complete lists of numerical parameters are provided for developing such numerical model. The CFD model also incorporates new multiphase model with enhanced heat and mass transfer capabilities for water phase change treatment as well as absorption and desorption modelling. This new approach is used to thoroughly study liquid water distribution inside the cell for dry and humid cases, as well as for co-flow vs. counter-flow configuration while the emphasis is directed towards liquid water distribution inside the porous media where condensation predominantly occurs. The robustness of the developed CFD model is demonstrated in its ability to accurately predict water pooling at lower currents, a phenomenon which could previously be only experimentally observed.

AB Owing to their high cooling efficiency in summer and frost-free characteristics in winter, heating tower heat pumps are becoming increasingly popular. However, the solution will be diluted during heating due to absorbing moisture from the air, and should be properly regenerated for continuous operation. In this study, a novel heat recovery solution regeneration system using an internally heated regenerator is proposed for antifreeze solution regeneration. A test bench is fabricated to investigate the regeneration performance of the internally heated regenerator. Correlations of the heat and mass transfer coefficients are proposed, and agree well with the experimental data. The influences of inlet parameters on the moisture removal rate, latent heat ratio, and humidity effectiveness are evaluated and compared to those for internally heated liquid desiccant regeneration. The results indicate that: the regeneration performance of the internally heated regenerator is affected mainly by the air flow rate, heating water flow rate, and inlet temperature of heating water. The moisture removal rate increases remarkably with increasing the heating water flow rate and inlet temperature of heating water. The latent heat ratio decreases significantly with increasing the inlet temperature of heating water. The humidity effectiveness decreases remarkably with increasing the air flow rate. The influences of the above inlet parameters on performance indices in the present study exhibit the same trends as those reported for internally heated liquid desiccant regeneration. However, compared with internally heated liquid desiccant regeneration, the regeneration temperature for internally heated antifreeze solution regeneration is much lower. This suggests that a low-grade heat source can be used to meet the antifreeze solution regeneration demands.

AB In this research work, an attempt has been made to compare the performance and emission characteristics of n-butanol (n-B), iso-butanol (Iso-B), n-pentanol (P) and benzyl alcohol (Bn) with gasoline at various load conditions in the ratio of 10:90 by volume respectively, in a 2 cylinder SI test engine with MPFI technology. Alcohols were selected based on the position of hydroxyl (OH) group in its molecular structure, OH group was in straight chain for n-butanol and n-pentanol while it was branched chain for iso-butanol and finally OH group was chained with benzene ring for benzyl alcohol. The favorable outcome was that the performance of the fuel blends was noticeably higher than neat gasoline, with Bn10 blend giving greater fuel power at 100% load and P10, Bn10 and iso-B10 giving greater brake thermal efficiency. On the other hand, it was observed that the fuel consumption of n-B10 was higher than gasoline but iso-B10 gave lower fuel consumption comparatively. Considering pollutant emissions, all the blends gave lower HC, CO, & CO2 emissions as compared to neat gasoline, although the NOx emissions increased with increasing loads. Considering both performance and emission characteristics it was finally concluded that benzyl alcohol - gasoline blend was better compared to other blends.

AB Oxyfuel carbon capture is both power and capital intensive due to oxygen demand. Consequently, oxyfuel requires the development of more efficient air separation units. This work proposes an alternative cryogenic distillation process for large-scale gaseous oxygen supply. Instead of using different pressure columns, the new air separation unit couples top vapor recompression to a single atmospheric cryogenic air distillation double-reboiler column, whose nitrogen-rich top vapor is compressed to heat the intermediate column reboiler, while the bottom reboiler is heated with compressed saturated air. Several processes for low-pressure oxygen gas supply were simulated and optimized. The power requirement of the new air separation unit producing atmospheric oxygen at 95%mol attained the best value of 139.0 kWh/t (oxygen basis). A sensitivity analysis for oxygen purity was performed showing that, even for higher purities, the new developed process achieves the lowest specific power for low-pressure gaseous oxygen production. The economic leverage of the new air separation unit is proven via successful supply of low-pressure oxygen to oxyfuel natural gas combined-cycle Gas To -Wire plant. Assuming carbon dioxide destination to enhanced oil recovery, even with an investment about 100% higher than the counterpart of a conventional air-fed combined-cycle Gas-To-Wire plant and despite net efficiency penalty of 6.88%, the oxyfuel combined-cycle Gas-To-Wire solution coupled to the new air separation unit was capable of achieving comparatively superior profitability under carbon taxation above 13.5 USD/t.

AB A novel tubular oscillating heat pipe (OHP) with sintered copper particles (SCPs) inside a flat-plate evaporator for the thermal management of high-power LED chips was designed and fabricated. The thermal performance of designed OHP, temperature distribution and illumination profiles of LED array were experimentally tested and evaluated. Results showed that the addition of SCPs on the evaporator of OHP can facilitate the startup and make oscillating motions of liquid-plugs/vapor-bubbles inside copper tubes more easily. A lowest thermal resistance of 0.168 K/W was achieved by the OHP with SCPs when the input power to the LED array was 60 W, and the corresponding maximum LED temperature can be controlled below 70 degrees C. The temperature distribution of LED array at different inclination angles was almost coincident and achieved good uniformity if the designed OHP was operated at low filling ratios, indicating that the gravity action can be partially neglected. It was also found that the temperature of LED array was inversely proportional to the illumination intensity, and a high filling ratio can cause the degradation of illumination intensity of LED chips. A low filling ratio of 30% was preferred for the designed OHP applied in high-power LED cooling.

AB In this study, the regional components of global model EGM08 Bouguer anomalies obtained by low pass filtering were inverted to map the geometries of Moho and Lithosphere-Asthenosphere Boundary (LAB) of the central Anatolian region. It was determined the Moho and LAB depths in the region to be 35.8-41.2 km and 67-91 km, respectively. The results from rheological modeling indicate mechanical decoupling of the crust and uppermost lithospheric mantle in eastern part and coupling in the western part of the study area. We also compare the Theological stratification with the focal depth distribution of earthquakes to examine the possible discrepancies between the brittle-ductile transition zone and the maximum depths of earthquakes along the selected profiles. The spatial variations of effective elastic thicknesses (EET) of the lithosphere have been estimated from the strength of the crust and lithospheric mantle by implying deformation gradient at Moho and LAB. The EET values vary in the range of 19-24.3 km. Although the EET values are relatively high in the eastern part of the region, lower EET values are directly underlain by thinned lithosphere of northwestern and southwestern part of central Anatolian region. We also analyze the crustal rheologies obtained from the lithospheric strength by delineating the pattern of crustal seismic activities.

AB Carbonate rocks with high maturity and low total organic carbon content are widely distributed in China. Whether they can be effective source rocks remains controversial, but they have great significance for the evaluation of hydrocarbon generation potential and exploration prospects of carbonate rocks. Dataset reveals that as the depth or maturity increases, total organic carbon (TOC) content, atomic H/C ratio, and hydrocarbon generation potential of carbonate source rocks with low total organic carbon (CSRLTOC) all decrease because of hydrocarbon expulsion. Moreover, some pyrolysis experiments also indicate that the CSRLTOC are able to generate and expel a quantity of hydrocarbons. The above studies indicate that CSRLTOC can be effective source rocks for oil/gas pools. The unique features of carbonate rocks and CSRLTOC demonstrate that they are easier to expel hydrocarbons and contribute to oil/gas reservoirs than shale, and thus, the lower limit of TOC (LLTOC) of effective carbonate source rocks could be smaller than shale (0.5%). The LLTOCs of effective carbonate source rocks with type I-III kerogen (mainly sapropelic group) at the levels of immaturity and low maturity, maturity, high maturity and over maturity are TOC = 0.5%, 0.5-0.3%, 0.3-0.2%, and 0.2-0.1%, respectively. If the carbonate source rocks are at the high-over mature stage, we could take 0.2% as the LLTOC. The present organic poor source rocks with high maturity are possibly moderate or good source rocks at the low mature level in the geological periods, especially carbonate source rocks if type I-III kerogen. Some typical oil and gas fields in China derive partly or mostly from the CSRLTOC, proving that CSRLTOC could be effective source rock in China.

TI Petrogenesis of Late Cretaceous mafic enclaves and their host granites

AB Late Triassic-Early Eocene Gangdese magmatic belt is over 2000 km long forming a significant component of the Lhasa Terrane, and is regarded as the ideal place to study the tectonic-magmatic evolution of the Neo-Tethys Ocean and the collision of the Indian and Asian continental plates. Recent studies elucidate the major Late Cretaceous magmatic events in southern Tibet, but the evolution of the region is still equivocal. In this paper, we report new results from systematic field work as well as new geochronological, petrological, geochemical, and zircon Lu-Hf isotope analyses of granite and contemporaneous mafic microgranular enclaves (MMEs) from the Nyemo region in southern Tibet. Both the host granite and MMEs are dated at ca. 87-84 Ma, suggesting that they are related to a coeval magmatic event. Zircon Hf isotopes (epsilon(Hf)(t) = + 11.0 - + 14.6) and Mg-# numbers (50-52) indicate that the host granite is derived from partial melting of juvenile crust with the contribution of material from the mantle, whereas the MMEs are derived from partial melting of depleted mantle (refractory peridotite melts) as deduced from their zircon Hf isotopes (epsilon(Hf)(t) = +6.12 - +13.79). Geochemically, both the granite and MMEs are characterized by enriched light rare earth elements (LREE) and large-ion lithophile elements (LILE), but depleted high field-strength elements (HFSE), indicative of arc-related geochemical compositions. The host granite also has high Sr/Y (111-140), which are interpreted as proxies for magmas with high water contents, and their elevated (La/Yb)(N) ratios of 22-33 are proxies for a thickened continental crust. We propose that the Late Cretaceous (ca. 100-80 Ma) magmatism dated some 30 million years before the collision of the Indian and Eurasian plates is possibly related to the interaction between upwelling asthenospheric mantle and metasomatized lithospheric mantle during subduction and possible rollback of the Neo-Tethys Oceanic plate. The subducted slab presumably led to mantle magma underplating and potentially caused crustal thickening in southern Tibet. Hence, the rollback of the Neo-Tethys Oceanic plate represents a key feature in the tectonic evolution of southern Tibet during the early Late Cretaceous.

AB The Yumu Shan (YMS) fault zone at the northeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau is characterized by actively growing fault-related folds and northeast-vergent thrusts or buried faults. This fault zone is expressed by an arc shaped fault line and can be divided into two segments: the northern and eastern YMS faults. Numerous studies indicated that the northern YMS fault is marked by reverse faulting with a left-lateral component and has undertaken two surface-rupturing events in the Holocene. But previous studies on the eastern YMS fault were conducted in the 1990s, and the limitations of dating and survey techniques led to a large uncertainty in fault slip rates and paleoseismological results. In addition, the kinematic mechanism of the arc-shaped YMS fault zone remains unknown. In this study, combining with the interpretation of high-resolution satellite imagery, real-time kinematic (RTK) GPS survey, optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) and Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon dating of deformed landforms and trenching, we study slip rates and paleoseismology along the eastern YMS fault. Our results show that its Late Quaternary vertical and horizontal slip rates are similar to 0.3-0.4 mm/yr and similar to 1.1 +/- 0.1 mm/yr, respectively. At its northwest tip, the fault consists of several sub-parallel branches and becomes dominantly reverse or thrusting with a vertical rate of similar to 1.1 mm/yr. Trenching data indicate that two events ruptured the eastern YMS fault occurring at 7.37-5.24 ka and 5.17-4.01 ka, respectively. The eastern YMS fault may behave synchronously or interact with the northern YMS fault. We propose that the arcuate structure under the perpendicular compression to the arch apex might illustrate the kinematic mechanism of the YMS fault zone.

AB It is widely accepted that large-scale strike-slip faults play an important role in accommodating the India-Eurasia convergence, but the relationships between surface displacements and deep deformation along the faults remain largely uncertain. To address this issue, new magnetotelluric (MT) images were obtained along two profiles across the Xiaojiang strike-slip fault system (XJFS), one of the most tectonically active areas in southwest China. Although different in details, these two profiles show similar overall crustal structures. The upper crust is generally resistive but separated by several narrow, subvertical conductors that broadly coincide with the surface traces of the XJFS. These fault zone conductors (FZCs) are interpreted to represent fault damage zones that formed by strike-slip faulting/shearing along the faults and filled with deeply-sourced magmatic and/or meta-morphic fluids. The lower crust is broadly characterized by enhanced conductivity and likely associated with partial melting at high temperatures. These observations are consistent with other geophysical measurements in this area and in favor of the development of ductile flow along the XJFS, although the pattern of flow is more complex than previously suggested. Based on these observations, we propose that active deformation along the XJFS can be better described, in the brittle upper crust, by strike-slip motion along the fluid-weakened faults, and by shear-enhanced ductile flow in the partially molten lower crust. These two mechanisms are not mutually exclusive but rather can be complementary to each other.

AB A precise measurement of the slip rate of active faults within and around the Tibetan Plateau will provide definite and explicit knowledge of continental dynamics and present-day active tectonic processes. The WNW-trending West Qinling Fault (WQLF), the target of this study, is one of the major active strike-slip faults developed in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau. The interpretation of three dimension (3D) perspective topographic maps, field investigations, and C-14-dating results reveal that (i) the drainage systems, mountain ridges, alluvial fans, and terrace risers have been systematically left-lateral deflected or offset by similar to 6 m up to hundreds of meters during the Late Pleistocene-Holocene along the WQLF in the northeastern marginal zone of the Tibetan Plateau; (ii) the left-lateral strike-slip rate is estimated to be similar to 2.5-2.9 mm/yr with an average value of similar to 2.7 mm/yr since the Late Pleistocene; (iii) compared to the well-studied strike-slip active faults developed in the northern and northwestern Tibetan Plateau such as the Altyn Tagh Fault and the Kunlun Fault with high slip rate of > 10-20 mm/yr, the WQLF displays a characteristically low strike-slip rate of < 3 mm/yr. We interpret that the low slip rate of the WQLF is related to the limited convergence transfer and that most of the strain energy was probably absorbed and partitioned by continuous crustal deformation in the northeastern marginal zone of the Tibetan Plateau, rather than only the localized deformation along active faults.

AB In this paper, we adopt the methods of Euler deconvolution, source parameter imaging (SPI), source edge detection (SED), inversion of the Moho interface, and three-dimensional (3-D) visualization of the crust for the inversion of the Bouguer gravity anomaly of the Longmen Shan and adjacent regions, analyse the 3-D structure, deep structure, and deformation characteristics of the crust, and investigate the cause of the deep seismogenic environment and the Wenchuan earthquake. The research indicates that the Longmen Shan fault zone is characterized by a NE-trending large gravity gradient zone with a gradient value that exceeds 3.7 mGal/km. The Euler diagram reveals that there is a low-density anomaly body in the lower crust of the Longmen Shan fault zone that is a NE-trending narrow strip approximately 100 km long, 65 km wide and 35-50 km deep. The Songpan-Garze block on the northwest side does not have the material source and pathway of the lower crustal flow in the Euler diagram. Therefore, the low-density anomaly body is related to the upwelling of the mantle heat flow below it. In comparison with the Songpan-Garze and Chum-Dian blocks, the strength of the field source of the Sichuan Basin is high (-175 to -96 mGal), indicating that the average density of the crust is high, and the depth of the field source is stable at 15-25 km. The SED map reveals that there has been counter-clockwise rotation of the Sichuan Basin since the Cenozoic. The SPI shows that the Longmen Shan fault zone is narrowly located in the beaded linear "shallow source anomaly" belt and that its two sides are stable areas of deep source anomalies, indicating characteristics of crustal hardness on both sides, so that it is prone to accumulate stress and strain. The Moho depth across the Longmen Shan descends from 41.8 km in the east to 61.6 km in the west. The complex intersection of high-density and low-density anomaly bodies appears in the deep part of the Longmen Shan tectonic belt, and the crustal structure is fragmented. Moreover, there is a strong abrupt change in the Moho topography, and therefore, this region has a deep environment for the genesis of strong earthquakes. The dextral strike-slip movement of the Longmen Shan fault zone is caused by the movement of the Songpan-Garze block and the counter-clockwise rotation of the Sichuan Basin; therefore, the counter-clockwise rotation of the Sichuan Basin is one of the important dynamic backgrounds for the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake.

AB Since the Late Cenozoic, the central-southern Longmen Shan (LMS) region is characterized by a two-decollement thrust-fold system with a localized upper evaporite weaker layer just beneath the Sichuan Basin and the lower stronger decollement beneath the LMS. To date, the role of upper decollement and erosion in shaping the structural deformation of the LMS remains unknown. The investigation of this question may shed lights on the assessment of the structural evolution and the further discrimination of mountain building mechanism. In this work, a 2D finite difference method is applied with regards to the variations of viscosity/friction angle, and lengths of upper decollement under different erosion rates. Two types of numerical models are setup, with purely lower-upper frictional (FF) decollements and lower-frictional upper-viscous (FV) decollements. Tectonic evolution with FF models exhibits large similarity with that of FV models. Meanwhile, our results underline the presence of in-sequence fault propagation procedures during most of the stages. The development of the boundary ramp, the Range Frontal Blind fault, is strongly induced by a prerequisite with upper decollement of necessary length. The activation of Beichuan/Pengguan faults or blind ramp piercing to the surface is extremely mechanically sensitive to the viscosity of the salt decollement, erosion rate, and the length of the upper decollement. Out-of-sequence thrusting, shallow and possible basal accretion processes beneath the Sichuan Basin are found when deformation transfers from the thick-skinned LMS to the thin-skinned Sichuan Basin at the very late stage, supporting upper crustal shortening dominates the mountain building mechanism.

TI Postseismic deformation following the April 25, 2015 Gorkha earthquake

AB The postseismic deformation consecutive to the April 25, 2015 Gorkha earthquake (Mw 7.9) is estimated in this paper based on a cGNSS network installed prior to the earthquake and supplemented by 6 cGNSS stations installed after the main shock. Postseismic displacement are obtained from daily time series corrected for interseismic deformation and seasonal variations. The maximum postseismic displacement is found north of the rupture area, where locally it reached 100 mm between the date of the earthquake and late 2016. The post-seismic deformation affects the northern part of the rupture area but not the southern part, along the southern part of the Main Himalayan Thrust (MHT). Three hypotheses for the mechanisms controlling postseismic deformation are tested through numerical simulations of the postseismic time series: (i) viscous relaxation, (ii) afterslip, or (iii) a combination of these two mechanisms. We can exclude postseismic deformation controlled by viscous relaxation of a thick deformation zone along the northern and lower flat of the MHT. However, it is impossible to discriminate between postseismic deformation controlled by either afterslip along the MHT (northern part of the rupture zone, crustal ramp, and lower flat of the MHT) or a combination of afterslip along the MHT (northern part of the rupture zone, crustal ramp) and viscous relaxation controlled by a thin (similar to 3-4 km thick) low-viscosity body centered on the lower flat of the MHT. The occurrence of afterslip along the northern part of the upper flat of the MHT and its longitudinal variations have been established thanks to the densification of GNSS network by our team presented in this paper.

AB The northeastern margin of Tibet is the youngest risen part and key area for understanding the growth mechanism of the Tibetan Plateau. New broadband magnetotelluric (MT) data are conducted at the conjunction of the Longmenshan and West Qinling orogenic belts in NE Tibet. The preferred resistivity model obtained using 3-D inversion method shows a dramatic resistivity contrast from the Sichuan Basin (SB) to the West Qinling Orogenic Belt (WQOB). Beneath the SB and Longmenshan Orogenic Belt (LMSOB), several low-resistivity zones are distributed in the upper crust underlain by an intact resistive lower crust, indicating the upper crustal deformation is responsible for the uplift of the LMSOB. While to the north, a prominently conductive lower crust is observed, favoring the ductile deformation of the weak lower crust plays a significant role in the crustal thickening of the WQOB. Therefore, we suggest contrasting crustal deformation mechanisms work in the LMSOB and WQOB, and diversified crustal deformations together contribute to the marginal growth of the plateau. Moreover, combining with other studies, we propose the deep conductive bodies beneath the WQOB would be induced by the hot upwelling related to the asthenospheric flow from the plateau.

AB We conduct a systematic detection of microseismicity around Yunnan Province, Southwest China following the 2004 Mw9.1 Sumatra and 2012 Mw8.6 Indian Ocean earthquakes. Based on seismicity analysis on China Earthquake Network Center (CENC) catalog and spectral analysis of continuous waveforms, we find clear evidence of triggered seismicity in Yunnan immediately after the 2004 mainshock, including a magnitude 4.8 earthquake near Tengchong volcanic region. In comparison, we do not find clear evidence of instantaneous triggering following the 2012 mainshock. We further apply a matched filter technique to detect micro earthquakes in Tengchong volcanic region 15 days before and 15 days after the 2012 mainshock. The seismicity rate remains stable immediately after the 2012 mainshock, and increases in the next few days, indicating a possible delayed triggering, although similar changes can be seen at other times long before and after the mainshock. In addition, we find possible evidence of remote triggering near the city of Yibin in Southern Sichuan Province, Southwest China, near the sites with ongoing shale gas development. We also examine other magnitude > 8 earthquakes from the Sumatra region and do not find any additional evidence of dynamic triggering around Yunnan We suggest that the absolute value of dynamic stress change is the most important factor to explain why the 2004 Sumatra event triggered a widespread seismicity rate increase around Yunnan, while other great events around Sumatra did not.

AB A global collisional orogenic event that formed the Columbia supercontinent occurred during 2100-1800 Ma. In the eastern North China Craton (NCC), the Paleoproterozoic Jiao-Liao-Ji orogenic belt (MOB), composed of metamorphosed volcanic-sedimentary rocks and intrusions, may have preserved records of the collisional event. Tectonics of the JLJOB thus becomes the key to the understanding of the tectonic evolution of the NCC, and may provide important information on assembly of the Columbia supercontinent. Two classical models, i.e. the rift closure model and arc-continent collision model, have been widely cited for the tectonic evolution of the JLJOB. The former is based on occurrence of A-type granites and bimodal volcanics within the orogenic belt, and comparable Archean blocks to the south and north of it, while the latter is supported by occurrence of calcalkaline volcanics, I-type granites, paired metamorphic belts and detrital zircon age constraints. Integration of literature results and our data, we suggest that the JLJOB was formed by closure of a back-arc basin at an active continental margin. Tectonic evolution of the JLJOB is subdivided into four stages, i.e., pre-orogenic stage at 2200-2060 Ma, transitional stage at 2060-1940 Ma, orogenic stage at 1940-1860 Ma and post-orogenic stage after 1860 Ma.

AB The 3-D shear wave velocity structure beneath south India crust and shallow mantle up to depth 1301cm, have been determined from the joint inversion of surface wave dispersion and interpolated receiver function (RF). The P wave RF interpolation helps to equalize the lateral sampling of the RF and the surface wave dispersion, which mainly simplifies the RFs. One of the major difficulties due to back azimuthal variations of receiver functions is suppressed by this scheme of spatial interpolation. We combine the interpolated receiver functions with Rayleigh wave dispersions to estimate the shear wave velocity structure beneath the region. This study reveals the significant variations in crustal thickness and nature of intra crustal layering of southern India shield. The crustal thickness of south India varies from 40 km in Deccan Volcanic Province (DVP), 38 km in East Dharwar Craton (EDC), 44 km in West Dharwar Craton, northern block (WDC-N), 50 km in West Dharwar Craton, southern block (WDC-S), 48 km in Southern Granulite Terrain (SGT) and 38 km in Kerala Khondalite Belt (KKB). The average upper crustal thickness is 5 km and that of middle crust is 15 km. The lower crust shows significant variations in terms of thickness (varies from 8 to 32 km) as well as the high velocity mafic layer. The shear wave velocity variations in the model correlate strongly with the different geological variations along different tectonic blocks of southern India. The DVP, surprisingly, does not have any distinct signature of volcanism in the underlying crust and shallow mantle. The shallow mantle part of entire south India has similar characteristics except for EDC where the velocity is higher beyond 85 km depth.

AB The Yulong porphyry Cu-Mo ore district in eastern Tibet features a series of Eocene felsic porphyry intrusions, only one of which is intensively mineralized. In this study, zircon U-Pb ages, and major and trace element compositions of whole rock samples and in-situ accessory minerals (zircon, apatite and titanite) from these various intrusions were analyzed to determine the factors controlling Cu mineralization. New zircon U-Pb dating, together with published zircon U-Pb ages, suggest that these porphyry intrusions were emplaced over a relatively short period of time (43.9 +/- 0.6 Ma to 40.9 +/- 0.3 Ma), with the mineralized Yulong intrusion emplaced at a late stage of the magmatic activity (41.1 +/- 0.3 Ma to 40.9 +/- 0.3 Ma). These intrusions have indistinguishable whole-rock major and trace element compositions, but the mineralized Yulong intrusion has higher apatite and titanite La/Yb ratios (average apatite La/Yb = 115.1 28.5, n = 52; average titanite La/Yb = 22.4 +/- 4.9, n = 38) than the earlier subeconomic intrusions (average apatite La/Yb = 50.4 +/- 12.3, n = 72; average titanite La/Yb = 12.4 +/- 3.5, n = 58), suggesting more fractionation of amphibole from the magmas that sourced it. Additionally, a negative relationship between La/Yb and Ce-N/Ce-N* ratios in apatite and titanite are interpreted to reflect increasing oxidation states through magma evolution.
   Indistinguishable zircon Eu-N/Eu-N* values and apatite core SO3 contents from the mineralized (zircon EuN/ Eu-N* = 0.69 +/- 0.06, n = 25; apatite SO3 = 0.65 +/- 0.24 wt%, n = 21) and subeconomic intrusions (zircon EuN/EuN* = 0.62 0.05, n = 64; apatite SO3 = 0.61 +/- 0.27 wt%, n = 15) suggest that the entire magmatic suite was relatively oxidized, hydrous and sulfur-rich, and was therefore fertile for ore-formation. However, apatite crystals from the mineralized Yulong intrusion have significantly lower Cl contents (0.08 +/- 0.03 wt%, n = 72) and higher F/Cl ratios (47.80 +/- 21.97, n = 72) than those from the subeconomic intrusions (Cl = 0.29 +/- 0.29 wt%; F/Cl = 12.87 +/- 5.16; n = 78). These data may reflect more extensive fluid exsolution from the parental magma chamber at the time of emplacement of the mineralizing Yulong magmas. Sudden and voluminous release of volatiles coeval with emplacement of the Yulong intrusion was triggered by an as yet unidentified process, but possibly including magmatic recharge.

AB The Qianhe River Basin is located at the convergence zone of the northeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau (NETP), the Ordos Block and the Qinling Mountains. A tectonic geomorphology study of the Qianhe River is significant for providing a deeper understanding of the tectonic transition between the NETP and the Ordos Block and the dynamic relationship of these three tectonic units. Based on Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection global digital elevation model (ASTER-GDEM) data and geographic information system (GIS) techniques, four tectonic geomorphic indices, the hypsometric integral (HI), stream length-gradient (SL), drainage basin asymmetry (AF), and drainage basin shape (BS), were calculated and analyzed. Geologic evidence from field surveys, deformation measurements, and fault slip rate estimates was also obtained to further discuss the tectonic activity and tectonic geomorphic evolution model. Through analytical comparisons, we proposed that the variations in the applied geomorphic index values were not significantly affected by climate and lithology but indicated variations in related tectonic activity. The geomorphic index value analysis suggested relatively strong tectonic activity in Liupanshan Mountain and Longshan Mountain and northwestward tectonic tilting of the southwest margin of the Ordos Block. The actual mechanisms responsible for the observed variations in the Qianhe River Basin are the rapid uplift and northeastward extrusion of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and the local tilting uplift of the southwestern Ordos Block.

AB The western Ordos fold-thrust belt is an intracontinental chain predominately formed in the Jurassic and subsequently reworked in the Late Cretaceous and Cenozoic. The structural deformation of the western Ordos fold thrust belt was driven by the force transmitted from the plate boundary of Asian collage. This study presents new structural analysis, apatite fission track and thermal modeling data in the Helanshan Mt Range of the western Ordos fold-thrust belt. The apatite fission-track analysis and thermal modeling suggest that the Helanshan Mt Range underwent two stages of cooling and exhumation since the Late Cretaceous. The first fast cooling stage in the Late Cretaceous (>90-70 Ma) led to ca. 1-1.2 km exhumation, and the second fast cooling was after ca. 30 Ma with an exhumation of ca. 1.8-2.2 km. Structural studies indicate that the Late Cretaceous exhumation was related to NW-SE compression and the exhumation of after ca. 30 Ma was associated with WNW-ESE transtension. The WNW-ESE transtension produced high angle normal faults by reworking the Mesozoic preexisting factures. Comprehensive analyses of the synchronous structures around the boundaries of the Asian collage suggest that the Late Cretaceous exhumation of the Helanshan Mt Range might be the far-field results of the convergence between the Pacific and Eurasian plates. The varying rates of the Pacific plate subduction may transmit NW-SW horizontal stress across the North China Plate. In contrast, the post-Oligocene (< 30 Ma) exhumation of the Helanshan Mt Range was induced by the Tibet plateau northeastward expansion. The produced force resulted in dextral strike-slip movements of the Helanshan Mt Range and transtension of the Yinchuan graben.

AB New geochronological, geochemical and Sr-Nd-Hf isotopic data for the early Cretaceous Daying volcanic sequence, eastern Qinling Orogen, provides a probe into the nature of, and tectonic process operating in, the underlying Mesozoic mantle. The volcanic rocks in the sequence are composed of basaltic trachyandesite, pyroxene-andesite, trachyandesite and trachyte. They yield zircon U-Pb and whole-rock Ar-40/Ar-39 plateau ages of 134-124 Ma, roughly synchronous with the Cretaceous igneous rocks throughout the eastern Qinling and Dabie orogens. Clinopyroxene and plagioclase phenocrysts of the volcanic rocks exhibit simple normal zonation with higher mg-number and An content in the core relative to the rim. The amphibole is characterized by tschermakite and tschermakitic hornblende with mg-number of 50-67. The Daying volcanic rocks have variable SiO2 (54.27-63.44 wt%), Al2O3 (15.39-20.34 wt%), FeOt (5.23-9.94 wt%), and MgO (1.05-4.03 wt%) contents with low mg-number (26-49). They exhibit arc-like REE-and PM-normalized patterns with significant negative Nb-Ta anomalies, and highly-enriched Sr-Nd isotopic composition with (Sr-87/Sr-86)(t) ratios of 0.7066-0.7078 and ENd(t) values of -15.5 similar to -11.0. Their zircons exhibit strongly negative Ew(t) values ranging from -27.3 to -17.2 and two-staged model ages from 2.90 Ga to 2.28 Ga. Such geochemical signatures suggest that the Daying volcanic rocks were derived from a hybridized source of the North China Craton enriched mantle with the input of some Yangtze crustal materials created by Triassic deep-subduction digestion. They also share similar eruption time, as well as elemental and Sr-Nd-Hf isotopic compositions, with those in the southern margin of the North China Craton, suggesting a northward subduction of the Yangtze block. It is proposed that the volcanic rocks are petrogenetically related to an early Cretaceous extensional event along the Qinling-Dabie Orogenic belt in response to unroofing of the thickened lithosphere.

AB The Sihong Segment of the Tan-Lu Fault Zone (SSTLFZ) is located in the Sihong county of the Jiangsu province and composed of 5 branches, which are mainly buried faults. The Tan-Lu Fault Zone is characterized by segmentation and its regional distribution, deep structures and geodynamic evolution in the Sihong area remains controversial. We provided evidence of gravity anomaly and seismic reflection profiles suggesting that the XinyiXindian fault (F2) and Qiaobeizhen-Suclian fault (F5) of the SSTLFZ are segmented, which appear as thrust faults in the north and normal faults in the south. The F2, F5 and Mohe-Lingcheng fault (F3) are inferred as Quaternary faults. Based on the inversion of gravity anomaly, the tectonic structure of the bedrock consists of two grabens and one horst and the Moho discontinuity depth in the Sihong area shows an obvious uplift. We conclude that a fault-depression superimposed basin developed inner the SSTLFZ. The northern segments of the F2 and F5 were inverted due to the continuous compression since Quaternary.

AB The Dabashan tectonic belt is at the northern margin of the central Yangtze block in central China, the foreland is a large-scale, south-westward-concaving arcuate thrust-fold belt in the transition zone between the Sichuan Basin and Qinling Mountains orogenic belt. To determine the deformation mechanism and structural style of the Dabashan foreland arcuate belt, the basic structural features of the arcuate tectonic belt in the Dabashan foreland and the main factors controlling the formation of the Dabashan arcuate belt were discussed based on field observations and a structural survey. The formation mechanism of the Dabashan orocline is different from that of the classic collisional orogenic model; it experienced an initial period of continental margin extension during the Palaeozoic, followed by folding and collisional orogeny during the Middle-Late Triassic and Middle-Late Jurassic orogenesis. Before the onset of orogenesis, the extension of the palaeocontinental margin and its irregular boundary shape played decisive roles in the formation of the arcuate zone. The Chengkou-Fangxian arcuate fault zone formed first, which not only controlled the sedimentary and magmatic activities in the northern margin of the Yangtze Block, but also controlled the formation of the Dabashan foreland arcuate belt as the dominant boundary during the orogeny of the Early Mesozoic. Basement uplift at both ends of the arcuate zone also played an important role in the orocline formation.

AB The vertical extension and structure of the sub-continental lithospheric mantle beneath the Archean Dharwar craton is the main attraction of the work presented here. To delineate the electrical conductivity structure of the Dharwar craton, a magnetotelluric study is carried out. This study comprises magnetotelluric data at 22 stations along a west-east slanting profile. Inter-station spacing is approximately 15 km. This magnetotelluric study is initiated from Dandeli (in the west) to Sindhanur (in the east side). The preferable geoelectric strike directions for the crust and lithospheric mantle are N3 degrees E and N16 degrees E respectively. A 2-dimensional (2-D) resistivity model derived by using the crustal and lithospheric mantle strike azimuths, identified conductive features in the stable continental Dharwar craton. In the crust, prominent conductors are present in the eastern and western part of the profile. A conducting feature is present in the deeper crust associated with the Chitradurga shear zone (CSZ). The study infers a thick lithosphere beneath Dharwar craton as a preserved cratonic nucleus on the eastern and a few conductive anomalies in the western part of the Dharwar craton. The model shows two separate conductors in the depth range of 110-250 km. This study shows, the possibility of presence of kimberlite melt in the western Dharwar craton in the depth range of 110-150 km.

AB The Xuefeng Intracontinental Tectonic System (XITS) is a large-scale compressional tectonic system in the central South China block. It is characterized by northeast-trending fold-thrust belts involving the Xuefeng zone, the Chevron syncline fold-thrust zone, the Chevron anticline fold-thrust zone and the Central Sichuan basin. This paper reports detrital zircon fission track (ZFT) analyses of the sandstones sampled from Neoproterozoic to Middle Jurassic sequences, and further discusses their relation with low-temperature tectonic evolution and sediment provenance. The totally annealed ZFT data of 452-377 Ma from the Neoproterozoic and Devonian sandstones were related to an Early Paleozoic low-temperature exhumation of the Jiangnan orogen due to intracontinental orogeny in the South China block. Those annealed ZFT components from Triassic to Jurassic sandstones, grouped 236-189 Ma, 189-142 Ma, and 142-124 Ma decreasingly from east to west structurally imply a northwestward progressively squeezing by the Xuefeng intracontinental orogeny as a result of the Paleo-Pacific subduction. The unannealed age components (411 Ma, 362-377 Ma, 270-216 Ma, and 209-183 Ma) of the Upper Triassic to Middle Jurassic sandstones, are comparable to the multistage tectonic evolution of the Qinling orogen through subduction, accretion and collision and are therefore indicative of sample potential provenance.

AB The India-Eurasia collision has created high mountains in the Himalayan plate boundary system, which has led to numerous earthquakes in this region and released part of the elastic strain accumulated over years. In this study, the present-day deformation pattern is derived from geodetic mode Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements obtained during 2005-2016 from 16 campaign sites in the Kumaun province of the central Himalaya. GPS derived horizontal velocity vectors are in the range of 1-9 mm/yr and 27-38 mm/yr with respect to stable India and Eurasia reference frames respectively. To understand the interseismic strain partitioning in the study region, we consider the uniform slip dislocation model over the fault in an elastic, isotropic and homogeneous half-space medium. The model indicates the Main Himalayan Thrust (MHT) fault is locked to a depth of similar to 20 km and slips at a rate of 17.2 +/- 1 mm/yr with a dip angle of similar to 7 degrees. This MHT slip rate build-up corresponds to a moment deficit of 8.4 +/- 1 x 10(18) Nm/yr due to locking of the fault beneath the Kumaun Himalaya. The total seismic strain accumulation of 61 x 10(-6) estimated from the geodetic data suggests the possibility of large earthquakes (typically magnitude 8 and above) with the recurrence interval of around 600 years in the Kumaun Himalayan region.

AB The Mersin ophiolite of the Central Taurides in southern Turkey represents an incomplete section of ocean lithosphere consisting from bottom to top of chromitite-bearing mantle peridotites, cumulate dunites, clinopyroxenites, and gabbros with rare pillow lavas covered by bathypelagic sedimentary rocks. The tectonized peridotites are harzburgites with minor dunites. They are strongly melt-depleted peridotites, comprising chromian spinel (Cr-spinel) with medium to high Cr-numbers (Cr#) [100 x Cr/(Cr + Al) = 48-82] and low Al2O3 concentrations (0.05-2.2 wt%). They display concave chondrite-normalized rare earth element (REE) patterns, which we interpret as evidence for their refertilization by boninitic melts in a mantle wedge. Geochemical evidence suggests that the parental magmas of the high-Cr podiform chromitites (Cr#(sp) = 71-83) were of boninitic composition. The chromitites host a platinum-group mineral (PGM) assemblage of laurite [Ru#-64.0-90.7] and Os-Ir alloys, indicating crystallization within a range of low fS(2) conditions (logfS(2) similar to -2 to -1.3) and a T-max of similar to 1200 degrees C.
   Mineral compositions and geochemical data of the basalts show tholeiitic to alkali compositions. The tholeiites show mildly light REE depleted patterns and high Th/Yb and La/Nb ratios indicate the presence of a sediment component, implying a subduction-related origin. Petrogenetic modeling indicates that the tholeiitic basalts resulted from 20% melting of a spinel-bearing asthenospheric mantle. The initial epsilon(Nd) values of 7.2 and 4.9 for two tholeiite samples indicate depleted asthenosphere and more enriched mantle sources probably due to the input of older sediment. A comparison with the data of other ophiolite complexes from southern Turkey suggests subduction-overprinted mantle sources as seen in immature island arcs. The trace element patterns of the alkali basalts are similar to OIB implying an origin unrelated to that of the ophiolite assemblage. The composition of the OIB can be modeled by mixing of magmas from low-degree (1-2%) melting of garnet-bearing lherzolite (GLS) with melt fractions from a spinel-bearing lherzolite (SLS) at variable proportions (GLS/SLS = 7/10-1/10).
   We propose the following tectono-magmatic model for the petrogenetic evolution of the Mersin ophiolite: i) oceanic ridge spreading generated MORE type magmas (not observed in our sample collection), (ii) melting of deep mantle sources beneath MORB type crust generated OIB-like basalts in Neo-Tethyan oceanic basin, (iii) subduction initiation and formation of an infant forearc basin formed island arc tholeiites and boninites.

AB An improved image of crust-mantle structure has been obtained through the joint inversion of P-to-s receiver functions and fundamental mode group velocity data (7-70 s) of Rayleigh and Love waves at fifteen broadband stations in the Eastern Indian Craton. Our modelling reveals a marked crustal thinning of 5-10 km below the Singhbhum-Odisha-Craton (SOC) while the modelled Moho depths show a flat crust with a thickness of 42 km below the Chotanagpur Granitic Gneissic Terrain (CGGT). The modelled lithosphere is thin (similar to 90 km) beneath the SOC and deepens on both north and south sides to similar to 100 km with a sharp drop of similar to 4.4% in shear velocity across the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary. The amount of melt required in the asthenosphere to account for this drop in shear velocity is similar to 1%. The isotopic constituents of the Dalma volcanic rocks contains asthenospheric component. We suggest that the modeled crustal and lithospheric thinning might have been resulted from the earlier magmatism or plume episodes that led to lithospheric delamination below the SOC. Our modeling also detects a common elongated feature (extending between latitude 21-23 degrees N and longitude 85-86.4 degrees E), which is characterized by a marked crustal (5-10 km) as well as lithospheric (10-15 km) thinning and a significant drop in Vs (-2.1 to -4.4%) in the upper mantle, below the SOC. This mapped area coincides with the horse-shoe shaped broad Singhbhum synclinorium known as Iron Ore Group (IOG) basin that hosts huge iron ore and to some extent manganese deposits of Precambrian age. This lithospheric feature is inferred to have played a key role in forming the passage for melts to carry various iron rich minerals and metals to the uppermost oceanic crust during the Archean plume associated with magmatism episode.

AB To examine possible relationships between regional changes in vegetation and climate and fluctuations in solar activity, we obtained a high-resolution 1000-year pollen record from the Sanjiaolongwan Maar Lake (SJML) in northeastern China. An age model was established using analyses of Pb-210, Cs-137 and AMS C-14. The pollen assemblages indicate that during the last millennium the vegetation of the study area was temperate coniferous and deciduous broadleaved mixed forest. Although Pinus is the most abundant pollen type in the record, various lines of evidence suggest that it is not especially temperature-sensitive. However, the analysis of the changes in pollen assemblages over the past 1000 years, and a comparison with pollen records from other lakes in the region, indicate that the Quercus frequencies can be used as a relatively sensitive temperature index for the study area. Several notable cold periods, with lower Quercus frequencies, occurred at approximately 1200 AD, 1410 AD, 1580 AD, 1770 AD and 1870 AD. These centennial-scale cold periods basically correspond to major minima in solar activity, suggesting that variations in solar activity may have been an important driver of climate and vegetation change in the study area during the last millennium.

AB Sulfur isotopic composition is useful for tracing sources of ore-forming materials. In situ sulfur isotope analysis by laser ablation coupled with multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-MC-ICPMS) has an advantage over traditional bulk analysis in tracing sources of sulfur in an ore deposit that has complex mineral types and multiple ore-forming processes. However, in using this method, matrix effects exist widely for sulfides from ore deposits. In this work, matrix effects of different sulfides were examined by matrix-unmatched tests, in which the delta S-34 values of different types of sulfides were calibrated against a laboratory pyrite standard. The results show that the delta S-34 values of pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite, molybdenite, sphalerite, and arsenopyrite are in agreement with the reference values, suggesting that the matrix effect was negligible. However, a significant matrix effect occurred in the analyses of Ag2S and galena, leading to significant deviations in delta S-34 values of up to 1.2 parts per thousand and 3.2 parts per thousand, respectively. The matrix effect occurred not only during the laser ablation stage but also during the transition of ions into the mass spectrometer, resulting in significant space charge effects caused by heavy-mass elements. Thus, pyrite can be used as an external bracketing standard for sulfides that do not have a heavy-mass matrix.
   Based on our matrix-effect study, the following available external standards were selected for the in situ sulfur isotope analysis of complex-type minerals from the Erlihe Zn-Pb deposit. The coarse-grained sphalerite grains (Sph1) and euhedral to subhedral pyrite grains (Pyl) from massive ores have delta S-34 values ranging from 9.2 parts per thousand to 18.1 parts per thousand. Such heavy sulfur isotopic compositions indicate the derivation of sulfur from the deposits of seawater sulfate, related to a thermochemical reducing process. Fine-grained sphalerite (Sph2) and pyrite (Py2) from vein and disseminated ores coexist with pyrrhotite and chalcopyrite, and have relatively light sulfur isotopic compositions, with S'S values of about 7 parts per thousand. The slightly positive delta S-34 values are similar to those of sulfides from sulfide-rich quartz veins, which contain delta S-34 values of about 4 parts per thousand, and granodiorite rocks, with delta S-34 values of about 6 parts per thousand. Based on previous studies, the light sulfur of the late-stage sulfides may have resulted from a metamorphic or magmatic hydrothermal event during the Indosinian orogeny. In situ sulfur analysis by LA-MC-ICPMS provides new evidence for sources of sulfur from each stage of mineralization in the Erlihe deposit, suggesting that this is a promising method for studying complex ore deposits.

AB The tectonic evolution of the Lhasa and Qiangtang collision zone is poorly understood due to a lack of pivotal magmatic records and complex geology in central Tibet. In this study, we present zircon U-Pb ages, whole-rock major and trace elements, and Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic data for the newly discovered Chuburi pluton in the southern Qiangtang block. Zircon U-Pb data reveal that the Chuburi pluton was emplaced during the Late Cretaceous (ca. 73 Ma). Bulk-rock analyses show that this intrusion is characterized by high SiO2, Na2O and K2O, but low MgO, CaO and P2O5. The granites are enriched with large-ion lithophile elements and light rare earth elements, with marked Eu anomalies, and there are few heavy rare earth elements and high field strength elements. These geochemical features indicate that the Chuburi pluton is a highly fractionated I-type granite. The nine granitic samples show high (Sr-87/Sr-86)(i) ratios (0.7064-0.7089), negative epsilon(Nd)(t) values (-1.94 to -5.59) and have Nd isotopic model ages ranging from 0.76 to 0.97 Ga. The initial Pb isotopic ratios of the Chuburi pluton is uniform: (Pb-206/Pb-204)t = 18.774-18.884; (Pb-207/(204)pb)(t) = 15.695-15.713; (Pb-208/Pb-264)t = 39.362-39.613. Based on geochemical characteristics of the Chuburi pluton, and consideration of the region geological setting, we suggest that the parent magma was generated by magmatic mixing of mantle and lower crust, and then undergoing extensive fractional crystallization with removal of K-feldspar, plagioclase, mafic mineral and minor accessory mineral. The crust beneath the central Tibet may have been significantly thickened following the final LhasaQiangtang amalgamation. We argue the generation of the Chuburi pluton can be interpreted as a result of regional lithospheric delamination.

AB The southwestern South Yellow Sea (SYS) is influenced by tremendous sediment loads derived from the Yellow River (Huanghe) and the Yangtze River (Changjiang). However, the influence of Yangtze River sediments and their transport mechanism in this area remain unresolved. In this study, we present the grain size, clay minerals, and elemental compositions of surface sediments from the southwestern SYS, together with an analysis of field observation seawater salinity and suspended sediment data, to investigate the provenance and transport mechanism of the sediments. Discrimination diagrams of clay minerals, Cr/Th vs. Sc/Al, and rare earth elements (REEs) indicate that the southwestern SYS sediments are mainly derived from the old Yellow River subaqueous delta and the Yangtze River. Interestingly, Yangtze sediments enter the SYS in ways that differ seasonally. In summer, Yangtze sediments may be transported into the central SYS by the dispersion of Changjiang Diluted Water (CDW) and may also be transported northwestward by the Subei Coastal Current (SCC) to the area off the Jiangsu coast. In winter, the Yangtze-derived sediments deposited off the Jiangsu coast in summer are transported into the central and/or even north SYS under the combined effects of the SCC, Yellow Sea Coastal Current (YSCC), and Yellow Sea Warm Current (YSWC). Throughout the transport processes, there is an alternation between a source and sink of Yangtze sediments off the Jiangsu coast; the coast serves as a sink of Yangtze sediments in summer but as a source of SYS sedimentation in winter. The depositional and transport mechanisms of Yangtze-derived sediments are closely associated with seasonal variations in the circulation system of the SYS.

AB As a major element of the lithosphere and minor element of the hydrosphere, magnesium (Mg) migrates and transforms during various geological processes, especially in the low-temperature processes. Magnesium has three stable isotopes, Mg-24, Mg-25, and Mg-26, with the relative abundances of 78.99%, 10.00% and 11.01%, respectively. Mass differences between Mg-24 and Mg-26 are more than 8%, thus significant mass fractionation could occur under changing chemical-physical conditions in different geological environments. As such, ratios between different Mg isotopes could be powerful indicators and tracers for geological processes. In this review, we summarize geochemical behaviors of Mg isotopes during magmatic, metamorphic, weathering, and diagenetic processes, to constrain the geological cycle of Mg isotopes. Mg isotopic fractionation occurs strongly during weathering process and precipitation and dissolution of carbonates and moderately during magmatism. There is limited Mg isotopic fractionation during metamorphism. A summary of Mg isotopic distribution and geochemical behaviors in the Earth system allow us to establish a Mg isotopic cycling model, and the geological applications to petrology, mineralogy, and mineralization processes are further reviewed. As a promising geo-thermometer, Mg isotopes are useful to calculate the temperature of different geological processes. Mg isotopes could be used to trace the magmatic history, petrogenesis, material circulation and mantle metasomatism, and genesis of ore deposits. Generally, the Mg isotopic composition of mantle is relatively homogeneous, which is similar to that of igneous rocks and metamorphic rocks. Some basalts and granites show heterogeneous Mg isotopic ratios resulting from incorporation of surficial materials. Carbonatites and carbonate rocks have very large variations in Mg isotopic compositions and are the main sink of light Mg isotopes in the Earth system. Siliceous sediments and sedimentary rocks contain clay minerals and have relatively heavy Mg isotopic compositions than the mantle. Soils and rivers from different regions have heterogeneous Mg isotopic compositions, whereas seawater has generally homogenous Mg isotopic composition. Surficial processes and chemical diffusion play a significant role in producing extremely variable Mg isotopic compositions.

AB In this paper, a three-dimensional finite element model is utilized to investigate the basic features of stress field change of Chinese mainland caused by the loss of fault load-bearing capacity and its influencing factors through the fault destruction with the killing element group method. This method provides a new way to explore the short term change of stress field in a large area and the corresponding migration of strong earthquakes. Our results show that killing the element group will cause the stress field adjustment in a large area. The equivalent stress in more than 55% elements is increased by more than 0.1 MPa. The change in the direction of principal stress is less than 20 degrees in 99.7% areas. The initial stress field greatly influences the stress field adjustment caused by killing the element group. By killing the element group around the 14 November 2001 Kunlunshan Ms 8.1 strong earthquake area, the perturbed stress field is consistent with the actual observed value of in-situ stress. Furthermore, a maximum equivalent stress element appears near the epicenter of the 12 May 2008 Wenchuan Ms 8.1 earthquake. These results suggest that the killing element group method can simulate some earthquake sequences, but further investigations are still required in the killing element group method by considering more non-linear influences on the stress perturbations.

AB We propose very efficient algorithms for the bootstrap percolation and the diffusion percolation models by extending the Newman-Ziff algorithm of the classical percolation (M.E.J. Newman and R.M. Ziff (2000) [27]). Using these algorithms and the finite-size-scaling, we calculated with high precision the percolation threshold and critical exponents in the eleven two-dimensional Archimedean lattices. We present the condition for the continuous percolation transition in the bootstrap percolation and the diffusion percolation, and show that they have the same critical exponents as the classical percolation within error bars in two dimensions. We conclude that the bootstrap percolation and the diffusion percolation almost certainly belong to the same universality class as the classical percolation. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB A highly accurate and memory-efficient approach for the solution of polymer self-consistent field theory (SCFT) is proposed. The central idea is to combine spectral integration in the polymer chain contour variable with a spectral deferred correction technique to solve the SCFT modified diffusion equations with arbitrarily high order of accuracy. The result is a robust method that achieves high accuracy with a minimal number of discrete contour nodes, which translates into vastly reduced memory requirements and increased computational efficiency. In particular, this spectral deferred correction method enables the computation of strongly segregated systems with unprecedented accuracy. Moreover, the framework of deferred corrections allows us to adaptively increase the order of accuracy during the outer saddle point iteration to drastically reduce the cost of a SCFT computation.

AB In this work, we design and analyze a conservative, positivity preserving, and free energy dissipating finite difference method for the multi-dimensional nonlocal Fokker-Planck (FP) equation. Based on a non-logarithmic Landau transformation, a central-differencing spatial discretization using harmonic-mean approximations is developed. Both forward and backward Euler discretizations in time are employed to derive an explicit scheme and a linearized semi-implicit scheme, respectively. Three desired properties that are possessed by analytical solutions: i) mass conservation, ii) free-energy dissipation, and iii) positivity, are proved to be maintained at discrete level. Remarkably, numerical analysis demonstrates that the semi-implicit time discretization ensures the property of positivity preserving unconditionally. Due to the advantages brought by the harmonic-mean approximations, an estimate on the upper bound of the condition number of the resulting coefficient matrix is further established for the semi-implicit scheme. Extensive numerical tests are performed to validate aforementioned properties numerically. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID LARGE-EDDY SIMULATION; INCOMPRESSIBLE FLOWS
AB In this Short Note, a graph-partitioning framework for a sharp-interface immersed boundary method is proposed so as to increase its computational efficiency for simulating internal flows on large-scale parallel computers. Immersed boundary methods are generally inefficient for internal flows with complex geometries due to the larger proportion of grid points that fall outside the fluid domain for such configurations. The graph-partitioning framework proposed here enables the solver to effectively ignore these points and focus the computation on the active points inside the fluid domain. A novel coarsening-partitioning process is proposed to ensure that sufficient overlapping layers are available at the sub-domain interfaces to accommodate computational stencils associated with the discretization as well as the sharp-interface boundary conditions. The benchmark test shows that the adoption of the graph topology reduces the computational cost (wall-time and memory cost) substantially. Moreover, the computational cost is shown to only scale with the number of computationally active grid points. The capability of the graph-partitioned solver is further demonstrated by simulating the flow inside an arterial network, a configuration which would otherwise be out of reach for most immersed boundary methods.

AB A genuinely two-dimension Riemann solver for compressible flows in curvilinear coordinates is proposed. Following Balsara's idea, this two-dimension solver considers not only the waves orthogonal to the cell interfaces, but also those transverse to the cell interfaces. By adopting the Toro-Vasquez splitting procedure, this solver constructs the two-dimensional convective flux and the two-dimensional pressure flux separately. Systematic numerical test cases are conducted. One dimensional Sod shock tube case and moving contact discontinuity case indicate that such two-dimensional solver is capable of capturing one-dimensional shocks, contact discontinuities, and expansion waves accurately. Two-dimensional double Mach reflection of a strong shock case shows that this scheme is with a high resolution in Cartesian coordinates. Also, it is robust against the unphysical shock anomaly phenomenon. Hypersonic viscous flows over the blunt cone and the two-dimensional Double-ellipsoid cases show that the two-dimensional solver proposed in this manuscript is with a high resolution in curvilinear coordinates. It is promising to be widely used in engineering areas to simulate compressible flows. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In the frameworks of immersed boundary method (IBM) and finite volume method (FVM), an implicit heat flux correction-based IB-FVM is proposed for thermal flows with Neumann boundary conditions. With the use of a fractional-step technique, the preconditioned Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations are solved by the FVM to obtain the intermediate solution in the prediction step and the heat flux is corrected by enforcing the Neumann condition in the correction step. Different from existing IBMs, the cell face centersare defined as the Eulerian points due to the heat flux computation at each face in the FVM. The Neumann condition is implemented in such a way that the interpolated temperature gradient is equal to the specified boundary value at the same point when the corrected gradient field is interpolated from the face centersto the Lagrangian points. To achieve an implicit algorithm, the temperature derivative corrections at the Lagrangian points are set as unknowns and a system of algebraic equations is established by constructing hybrid thin-plate splines (TPS) interpolation/delta function distribution. In the derivative interpolation process, the much more accurate TPS is introduced because the use of cosine delta function yields a less accurate solution. After the distribution process, the heat flux correction of a fluid cell is evaluated by using the solved temperature derivative corrections at the face centers, but that of a solid cell is calculated by using their additive inverses to supplement the same amount of heat flux into the solid domain as that flowing into the fluid domain across the boundary. Finally, the heat flux of a cell is corrected by adding the correction to the intermediate value and the corrected heat flux is utilized to solve the N-S equations in the prediction step. As compared with the available implicit IBMs for Neumann conditions, the present method avoids the introduction of auxiliary layers of Lagrangian points as well as the approximate conversion from the Neumann to Dirichlet condition and thus is suitable for an arbitrary geometry. The proposed method is verified by simulating several benchmark thermal flows with Neumann conditions, the natural convection in an annulus and the steady or unsteady forced convection over a stationary or oscillating cylinder. All the computed results agree well with the literature data. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Low-order discretization schemes are suitable for modeling 3-D multiphysics problems since a huge number of degrees of freedom (DoFs) is typically required by standard high-order Finite Element Method (FEM). On the other hand, polyhedral meshes ensure a great flexibility in the domain discretization and are thus suitable for complex model geometries. These features are useful for the multiphysics simulation of micro piezoelectric devices with a thin multi-layered and multi-material structure. The Cell Method (CM) is a low-order discretization scheme which has been mainly adopted up to now for electromagnetic problems but has not yet been used for mechanical problems with polyhedral discretization. This work extends the CM to piezo-elasticity by reformulating local constitutive relationships in terms of displacement gradient. In such a way, piecewise uniform edge basis functions defined on arbitrary polyhedral meshes can be used for discretizing local constitutive relationships. With the CM matrix assembly is completely Jacobian-free and do not require Gaussian integration, reducing code complexity. The smoothing technique, firstly introduced for FEM, is here extended to CM in order to avoid shear locking arising when low-order discretization is used for thin cantilevered beams under bending. The smoothed CM is validated for static and dynamic problems on a real test case by comparison with both second-order FEM and experimental data. Numerical results show that accuracy is retained even if a much lower number of DoFs is required compared to FEM. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We present a Lagrangian discontinuous Galerkin (DG) hydrodynamic method that is up to third-order accurate using subcell mesh stabilization (SMS) for compressible flows on quadratic meshes in two-dimensional (2D) Cartesian coordinates. Similar to the second-order accurate Lagrangian DG method with linear meshes, the physical evolution equations for the specific volume, velocity, and specific total energy are discretized using a modal DG method with Taylor series polynomials. The Riemann velocity at the vertices of a curvilinear cell, and the corresponding surface forces, are calculated by solving a multidirectional approximate Riemann problem. Curvilinear cells (e.g., quadratic quadrilateral meshes in this work) have many deformational degrees of freedom, and with these cells, they can deform in unphysical ways. Likewise, the Riemann solution at an edge vertex differs from the one at the corner of a cell. With SMS, each quadratic quadrilateral cell is decomposed into four quadrilateral subcells, that move in a Lagrangian manner. The edge vertex is surrounded by four subcells so that it is similar to the vertex at the cell corner. SMS can detect inconsistent density fields between the cell and subcells. The difference between these two density fields is used to correct the stress (pressure) input to the Riemann solver. This SMS scheme enables stable mesh motion and accurate solutions in the context of a Lagrangian high-order DG method that is up to third-order with quadratic cells. We also present effective limiting strategies that ensure monotonicity of the primitive variables with the high-order DG method. This Lagrangian DG hydrodynamic method with SMS conserves mass, momentum, and total energy. A suite of test problems are calculated to demonstrate the designed order of accuracy (up to third-order accurate) of this method, and that the Lagrangian DG method using SMS preserves cylindrical symmetry on 1D radial flow problems with an equal-angle polar quadratic mesh.

AB In most classical approaches of computational geophysics for seismic wave propagation problems, complex surface topography is either accounted for by boundary-fitted unstructured meshes, or, where possible, by mapping the complex computational domain from physical space to a topologically simple domain in a reference coordinate system. However, all these conventional approaches face problems if the geometry of the problem becomes sufficiently complex. They either need a mesh generator to create unstructured boundary-fitted grids, which can become quite difficult and may require a lot of manual user interactions in order to obtain a high quality mesh, or they need the explicit computation of an appropriate mapping function from physical to reference coordinates. For sufficiently complex geometries such mappings may either not exist or their Jacobian could become close to singular. Furthermore, in both conventional approaches low quality grids will always lead to very small time steps due to the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition for explicit schemes. In this paper, we propose a completely different strategy that follows the ideas of the successful family of high resolution shock-capturing schemes, where discontinuities can actually be resolved anywhere on the grid, without having to fit them exactly. We address the problem of geometrically complex free surface boundary conditions for seismic wave propagation problems with a novel diffuse interface method (DIM) on adaptive Cartesian meshes (AMR) that consists in the introduction of a characteristic function 0 <= alpha <= 1 which identifies the location of the solid medium and the surrounding air (or vacuum) and thus implicitly defines the location of the free surface boundary. Physically, alpha presents the volume fraction of the solid medium present in a control volume. Our new approach completely avoids the problem of mesh generation, since all that is needed for the definition of the complex surface topography is to set a scalar color function to unity inside the regions covered by the solid and to zero outside. The governing equations are derived from ideas typically used in the mathematical description of compressible multiphase flows. An analysis of the eigenvalues of the PDE system shows that the complexity of the geometry has no influence on the admissible time step size due to the CFL condition. The model reduces to the classical linear elasticity equations inside the solid medium where the gradients of alpha are zero, while in the diffuse interface zone at the free surface boundary the governing PDE system becomes nonlinear. We can prove that the solution of the Riemann problem with arbitrary data and a jump in alpha from unity to zero yields a Godunov-state at the interface that satisfies the free-surface boundary condition exactly, i.e. the normal stress components vanish. In the general case of an interface that is not aligned with the grid and which is not infinitely thin, a systematic study on the distribution of the volume fraction function inside the interface and the sensitivity with respect to the thickness of the diffuse interface layer has been carried out. In order to reduce numerical dissipation, we use high order discontinuous Galerkin (DG) finite element schemes on adaptive AMR grids together with a second order accurate high resolution shock capturing subcell finite volume (FV) limiter in the diffuse interface region.
   We furthermore employ a little dissipative HLLEM Riemann solver, which is able to resolve the steady contact discontinuity associated with the volume fraction function and the spatially variable material parameters exactly. While the method is locally high order accurate in the regions without limiter, the global order of accuracy of the scheme is at most two if the limiter is activated. It is locally of order one inside the diffuse interface region, which is typical for shock-capturing schemes at shocks and contact discontinuities. We show a large set of computational results in two and three space dimensions involving complex geometries where the physical interface is not aligned with the grid or where it is even moving. For all test cases we provide a quantitative comparison with classical approaches based on boundary-fitted unstructured meshes. (C) 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB The unified gas-kinetic scheme (UGKS) is a direct modeling method for multiple scale transport. Based on the ratio of time step to the particle collision time, the local evolution solution on the mesh size and time step scales is used in the construction of the multiscale method. For a flow problem covering multiple flow regimes, such as the hypersonic flow around a flying vehicle in near space, the UGKS is able to capture the highly compressed Navier-Stokes solution in one region and fully expanded free molecular flow in another region, with significant variations of the ratio between the time step and the local particle collision time around the vehicle. For an explicit UGKS, the time step in the whole computational domain is determined by the CFL condition. With implicit and multigrid techniques, the efficiency of the UGKS [1,2] has been improved by two orders of magnitude for steady state computation. However, for unsteady flow computation, due to the CFL condition the global time step used in the explicit UGKS may be limited by the smallest cell size in the computational domain. As a result, for a largely stretched non-uniform mesh the global time step becomes very small and the ratio of the time step to the local particle collision time may get a very small value. Under such a circumstance, even though the UGKS is a multiscale method, the real physics represented in the explicit UGKS may be constrained to the kinetic scale transport only, and the advantage of the multiscale nature in UGKS has not been fully utilized. In order to solve the multiscale unsteady flow problem efficiently, the time step restriction from a global CFL condition has to be released. In this paper, we will develop an implicit UGKS (IUGKS) for unsteady flows by alternatively solving the macroscopic and microscopic governing equations within a time step iteratively. With a pre-defined uniform large evolution time step, the local CFL number varies greatly in different region, such as on the order 1 in the large numerical cell size region, and 100 in the small cell size region. In order to preserve coherent flow evolution and keep the multiscale nature, the time averaged numerical flux across a cell interface is still evaluated by the explicit UGKS under the local CFL condition. Therefore, the multiscale property of the UGKS modeling has been kept over non-uniform meshes. With improved temporal discretization, the current IUGKS can automatically go back to the explicit UGKS and obtain identical solutions when the time step of the implicit scheme gets to that of an explicit one. Many numerical examples are included to validate the scheme for both continuum and rarefied flows with a large variation of artificially generated mesh size. The IUGKS has a second order accuracy and presents reasonably good results for unsteady flow computation, and its efficiency has been improved by dozens of times in comparison with the explicit UGKS.

AB Performing highly accurate simulations of droplet systems is a challenging problem. This is primarily due to the interface dynamics which is complicated further by the addition of surfactants. This paper presents a boundary integral method for computing the evolution of surfactant-covered droplets in 2D Stokes flow. The method has spectral accuracy in space and the adaptive time-stepping scheme allows for control of the temporal errors. Previously available semi-analytical solutions (based on conformal-mapping techniques) are extended to include surfactants, and a set of algorithms is introduced to detail their evaluation. These semi-analytical solutions are used to validate and assess the accuracy of the boundary integral method, and it is demonstrated that the presented method maintains its high accuracy even when droplets are in close proximity.

AB The combination of fluid-structure interactions with stochasticity, due to thermal fluctuations, remains a challenging problem in computational fluid dynamics. We develop an efficient scheme based on the stochastic immersed boundary method, Stokeslets, and multiple timestepping. We test our method for spherical particles and filaments under purely thermal and deterministic forces and find good agreement with theoretical predictions for Brownian Motion of a particle and equilibrium thermal undulations of a semi-flexible filament. As an initial application, we simulate bio-filaments with the properties of F-actin. We specifically study the average time for two nearby parallel filaments to bundle together. Interestingly, we find a two-fold acceleration in this time between simulations that account for long-range hydrodynamics compared to those that do not, suggesting that our method will reveal significant hydrodynamic effects in biological phenomena.

AB In this paper, a unified gas-kinetic scheme (UGKS) for multiphase dilute gas-particle system is proposed. The UGKS multiphase (UGKS-M) is a finite volume method, which captures flow physics in the regimes from collisionless multispecies transport to the two-fluid hydrodynamic Navier-Stokes (NS) solution with the variation of Knudsen number, and from granular flow regime to dusty gas dynamics with the variation of Stokes number. The reason for preserving the multiscale nature in UGKS-M is mainly coming from the direct modeling of the flow physics in the scales of discrete cell size and time step, where the ratio of the time step to the particle collision time determines flow behavior in different regimes. For the particle phase, the time evolution solution of the kinetic model equation is used in the construction of numerical flux, which takes into account the particle transport, collision, and acceleration. The gas phase is assumed to be in the continuum flow regime and evolves numerically by the gas-kinetic scheme (GKS), which is a subset of the UGKS for the Navier-Stokes solutions. The interaction between the gas and particle phase is calculated based on a velocity space mapping method, which solves accurately the kinetic acceleration process. The stability of UGKS-M is determined by the CFL condition only. With the inclusion of the material temperature evolution equation of solid particles, once the total energy loss in inelastic collision transfers into particle material thermal energy, the UGKS-M conserves the total mass, momentum, and energy for the whole multiphase system. In the numerical tests, the UGKS-M shows multiscale property in capturing the particle trajectory crossing (PTC), particle wall reflecting phenomena, and vortex-induced segregation of inertial particles under different Stokes numbers. The scheme is also applied to simulate shock induced fluidization problem, where the simulation results agree well with experimental measurements. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID SINGULAR SOURCE TERMS; APPROXIMATION
AB Seismic sources are commonly idealized as point-sources due to their small spatial extent relative to seismic wavelengths. The acoustic isotropic point-radiator is inadequate as a model of seismic wave generation for seismic sources that are known to exhibit directivity. Therefore, accurate modeling of seismic wavefields must include source representations generating anisotropic radiation patterns. Such seismic sources can be modeled as multipoles, that is, a time-dependent linear combination of spatial derivatives of the spatial delta function. Since the solutions of linear hyperbolic systems with point-source right hand sides are necessarily singular, standard results on convergence of grid-based numerical methods (finite difference or finite element) do not imply convergence of numerical solutions. We present a method for discretizing multipole sources in a finite difference setting, an extension of the moment matching conditions developed for the Dirac delta function in other applications, along with numerical evidence demonstrating the accuracy of these approximations. Using this analysis, we develop a weak convergence theory for the discretization of a family of symmetric hyperbolic systems of first-order partial differential equations, with singular source terms, solved via staggered-grid finite difference methods: we show that grid-independent space-time averages of the numerical solutions converge to the same averages of the continuum solution, and provide an estimate for the error in terms of moment matching and truncation error conditions. Numerical experiments confirm this result, but also suggest a stronger one: optimal convergence rates appear to be achievedpoint-wise in space away from the source. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB A novel 5th-order shock capturing scheme is presented in this paper. The scheme, so-called P4T2 - BVD (polynomial of 4-degree and THINC function of 2-level reconstruction based on BVD algorithm), is formulated as a two-stage spatial reconstruction scheme following the BVD (Boundary Variation Diminishing) principle that minimizes the jumps of the reconstructed values at cell boundaries. In the P4T2 - BVD scheme, polynomial of degree four and THINC (Tangent of Hyperbola for INterface Capturing) functions with two-level steepness are used as the candidate reconstruction functions. The final reconstruction function is selected through the two-stage BVD algorithm so as to effectively control both numerical oscillation and dissipation. Spectral analysis and numerical verifications show that the P4T2 - BVDscheme possesses the following desirable properties: 1) it effectively suppresses spurious numerical oscillation in the presence of strong shock or discontinuity; 2) it substantially reduces numerical dissipation errors; 3) it automatically retrieves the underlying linear 5th-order upwind scheme for smooth solution over all wave numbers; 4) it is able to resolve both smooth and discontinuous flow structures of all scales with substantially improved solution quality in comparison to other existing methods; and 5) it produces accurate solutions in long term computation. P4T2 - BVD, as well as the underlying idea presented in this paper, provides an innovative and practical approach to design high-fidelity numerical schemes for compressible flows involving strong discontinuities and flow structures of wide range scales.

AB Inverse scattering has been an active research area for the past thirty years. While very successful in many cases, progress has lagged when only limited-aperture measurement is available. In this paper, we perform some elementary study to recover data that can not be measured directly. In particular, we aim at recovering the full-aperture far field data from limited-aperture measurement. Due to the reciprocity relation, the multi-static response matrix (MSR) has a symmetric structure. Using the Green's formula and single layer potential, we propose two schemes to recover full-aperture MSR. The recovered data is tested by a recently proposed direct sampling method and the factorization method. Numerical results show that it is possible to, at least, partially recover the missing data and consequently improve the reconstruction of the scatterer. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A non-oscillatory forward-in-time (NFT) integrator is developed to provide solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible flows. Simulations of flows past a sphere are chosen as a benchmark representative of a class of engineering flows past obstacles. The methodology is further extended to moderate Reynolds number, stably stratified flows under gravity, for Froude numbers that typify the characteristic regimes of natural flows past distinct isolated features of topography in weather and climate models. The key elements of the proposed method consist of the Multidimensional Positive Definite Advection Transport Algorithm (MPDATA) and a robust non-symmetric Krylov-subspace elliptic solver. The solutions employ a finite volume spatial discretisation on unstructured and hybrid meshes and benefit from a collocated arrangement of all flow variables while being inherently stable. The development includes the implementation of viscous terms with the detached-eddy simulation (DES) approach employed for turbulent flows. Results demonstrate that the proposed methodology enables direct comparisons of the numerical solutions with corresponding laboratory studies of viscous and stratified flows while illustrating accuracy, robustness and flexibility of the NFT schemes. The presented simulations also offer a better insight into stably stratified flows past a sphere. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, a Runge-Kutta Discontinuous Galerkin (RKDG) method is proposed for solving the two-dimensional ideal compressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations under the Lagrangian framework. The method is based on the Lagrangian type scheme designed for the Euler equations of compressible gas dynamics on arbitrary quadrilateral meshes. To deal with the divergence free constraint condition of the magnetic field, we adopt the local divergence free function space to approximate the magnetic field. A HWENO reconstruction limiter is presented for the numerical solution to inhibit the non-physical oscillation for flows with strong discontinuities. This limiter can not only preserve the local divergence free property of the magnetic field but also avoid to calculate the complex eigen-system of the MHD equations. Some numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and the non-oscillatory property of the scheme. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We present a Stochastic Finite Volume - ADER (SFV-ADER) methodology for Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) in the general framework of systems of hyperbolic balance laws with uncertainty in parameters. The resulting method is weakly intrusive, meaning that deterministic solvers need minor modifications to include random contributions, and has no theoretical accuracy barrier. An illustration of the second-order version for the viscous Burgers equation with uncertain viscosity coefficient is first given in detail, under different deterministic initial conditions; the attainment of the theoretically expected convergence rate is demonstrated empirically; results and features of our scheme are discussed. We then extend the SFV-ADER method to a non-linear hyperbolic system with source terms that models one-dimensional blood flow in arteries, assuming uncertainties in a set of parameters of the problem. Results are then compared with measurements in a well-defined 1:1 experimental replica of the network of largest arteries in the human systemic circulation. For a 99%-confidence level, severe influence of parameter fluctuations is seen in pressure profiles, while secondary effects on flow rate profiles become visible, particularly in terminal branches. Results suggest that the proposed methodology could successfully be applied to other physical problems involving hyperbolic balance laws. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The objective of this paper is twofold. First, we propose two composable block solver methodologies to solve the discrete systems that arise from finite element discretizations of the double porosity/permeability (DPP) model. The DPP model, which is a four-field mathematical model, describes the flow of a single-phase incompressible fluid in a porous medium with two distinct pore-networks and with a possibility of mass transfer between them. Using the composable solvers feature available in PETSc and the finite element libraries available under the Firedrake Project, we illustrate two different ways by which one can effectively precondition these large systems of equations. Second, we employ the recently developed performance model called the Time-Accuracy-Size (TAS) spectrum to demonstrate that the proposed composable block solvers are scalable in both the parallel and algorithmic sense. Moreover, we utilize this spectrum analysis to compare the performance of three different finite element discretizations (classical mixed formulation with H(div) elements, stabilized continuous Galerkin mixed formulation, and stabilized discontinuous Galerkin mixed formulation) for the DPP model. Our performance spectrum analysis demonstrates that the composable block solvers are fine choices for any of these three finite element discretizations. Sample computer codes are provided to illustrate how one can easily implement the proposed block solver methodologies through PETSc command line options. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In the dynamical systems approach to describing turbulent or otherwise chaotic flows, an important quantity is the Lyapunov exponents and vectors that characterize the strange attractor of the flow. In particular, knowledge of the Lyapunov exponents and vectors will help identify perturbations that the system is most sensitive to, and quantify the dimension of the attractor. However, reliably computing these quantities requires robust numerical algorithms. While several perturbation-based techniques are available in literature, their application to commonly used turbulent flow solvers as well the numerical convergence properties have not been studied in detail. The goal of this work is to examine the convergence properties of the Lyapunov exponents when computed using a low Mach number solver, for a series of progressively complex flow problems. In particular, amanufactured solutions approach is devised using the Orr-Sommerfeld (OS) perturbation theory to extract Lyapunov exponents and vectors from OS eigen solutions. Overall the spatial convergence rates of Lyapunov exponents follow the truncation order for the discretization scheme. However, temporal convergence rates were found to be only a weak function of timestep used. Additionally, for some configurations, the convergence properties are found to depend on the Lyapunov exponent itself. These results indicate that convergence properties do not follow universal rates, and require careful analysis for specific configurations considered. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID ACCURACY
AB Two gradient-stencil augmentation techniques are discussed: symmetric and F-decreasing augmentations, for efficient and robust implicit finite-volume-solver convergence on distorted unstructured grids. The former augments a face-neighbor stencil with extra cells to increase the symmetry of the stencil as much as possible, and the latter adds further extra cells to decrease the reciprocal of the Frobenius norm of a scaled least-squares matrix to minimize the lower bound of the magnitude of the gradient. These techniques are proposed as efficient ways of overcoming a known stability issue with a face-neighbor stencil. It is demonstrated that the F-decreasing augmentation in combination with the symmetric augmentation yields robust and efficient gradient stencils on highly distorted quadrilateral and triangular grids.

AB In this paper, numerical schemes are introduced for the efficient resolution of anisotropic equations including high order differential operators. The model problem investigated in this paper, though simplified, is representative of the difficulties encountered in the modeling of Tokamak plasmas. The occurrence of high order differential operators introduces specific difficulties for the design of effective numerical methods. On the one hand, regular discretizations of the problem provide matrices characterized by a condition number that blows up with increasing anisotropy strength. On the other hand, matrices issued from Asymptotic-Preserving methods preserve a condition number bounded with respect to the anisotropy strength, nonetheless it scales very poorly as the mesh is refined. Both alternatives reveal to be inoperative in this specific framework to address the targeted values of anisotropy on refined meshes. We therefore introduce two successful methods offering the advantages of each approach: a condition number unrelated to the anisotropy strength and scaling as favorably as standard discretizations with the mesh refinement.

AB In this paper, we propose several novel recovery based finite element methods for the 2D Cahn-Hilliard equation. One distinguishing feature of those methods is that we discretize the fourth-order differential operator in a standard C-0 linear finite elements space. Precisely, we first transform the fourth-order Cahn-Hilliard equation to its variational formulation in which only first-order and second-order derivatives are involved and then we compute the first and second-order derivatives of a linear finite element function by a least-squares fitting recovery procedure. When the underlying mesh is uniform meshes of regular pattern, our recovery scheme for the Laplacian operator coincides with the well-known five-point stencil. Another feature of the methods is some special treatments on Neumann type boundary conditions for reducing computational cost. The optimal-order convergence and energy stability are numerically proved through a series of benchmark tests. The proposed method can be regarded as a combination of the finite difference scheme and the finite element scheme. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We propose a general class of genuinely two-dimensional incomplete Riemann solvers for systems of conservation laws. In particular, extensions of Balsara's multidimensional HLL scheme [3] to two-dimensional PVM/RVM (Polynomial/Rational Viscosity Matrix) finite volume methods are considered. The numerical flux is constructed by assembling, at each edge of the computational mesh, a one-dimensional PVM/RVM flux with two purely two-dimensional PVM/RVM fluxes at vertices, which take into account transversal features of the flow.
   The proposed methods are applicable to general hyperbolic systems, although in this paper we focus on applications to magnetohydrodynamics. In particular, we propose an efficient technique for divergence cleaning of the magnetic field that provides good results when combined with our two-dimensional solvers. Several numerical tests including genuinely two-dimensional effects are presented to test the performances of the proposed schemes. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We present a numerical method for computing the single layer (Stokeslet) and double layer (stresslet) integrals in Stokes flow. The method applies to smooth, closed surfaces in three dimensions, and achieves high accuracy both on and near the surface. The singular Stokeslet and stresslet kernels are regularized and, for the nearly singular case, corrections are added to reduce the regularization error. These corrections are derived analytically for both the Stokeslet and the stresslet using local asymptotic analysis. For the case of evaluating the integrals on the surface, as needed when solving integral equations, we design high order regularizations for both kernels that do not require corrections. This approach is direct in that it does not require grid refinement or special quadrature near the singularity, and therefore does not increase the computational complexity of the overall algorithm. Numerical tests demonstrate the uniform convergence rates for several surfaces in both the singular and near singular cases, as well as the importance of corrections when two surfaces are close to each other.

In the past decades, the failure in such layered media has been studied by many researchers due to their critical role in the mechanics and physics of solids. This study aims at investigating crack-interface interaction in two-dimensional (2-D) and three-dimensional (3-D) layered media by a phase field model. Our objectives are fourfold: (a) to better understand fracture behavior in layered heterogeneous systems under quasi-static load; (b) to introduce a new methodology for better describing interfaces by a regularized interfacial transition zone in the context of variational phase field approach, exploring its important role; (c) to show the accuracy, performance and applicability of the present model in modeling material failure at the interfaces in both 2-D and 3-D bodies; and (d) to quantitatively validate computed crack path with respect to experimental data. Phase field models with both perfectly and cohesive bonded interfaces are thus derived. A regularized interfacial transition zone is introduced to capture characteristics of material mismatch at the interfaces. Numerical examples for 2-D and 3-D layered systems with experimental validation provide fundamentals of fracture behavior in layered structures. The obtained results shed light on the behavior of crack paths, which are drastically affected by the elastic modulus mismatch between two layers and interface types, and reveal the important role of the proposed interfacial transition zone in phase field modeling of crack-interface interactions.

AB The standard Yee's scheme for the Maxwell eigenvalue problem places the discrete electric field variable at the midpoints of the edges of the grid cells. It performs well when the permittivity is a scalar field. However, when the permittivity is a Hermitian full tensor field it would generate un-physical complex eigenvalues or frequencies. In this paper, we propose a finite element method which can be interpreted as a modified Yee's scheme to overcome this difficulty. This interpretation enables us to create a fast FFT eigensolver that can compute very effectively the band structure of the anisotropic photonic crystal with SC and FCC lattices. Furthermore, we overcome the usual large null space associated with the Maxwell eigenvalue problem by deriving a null-space free discrete eigenvalue problem which involves a crucial Hermitian positive definite linear system to be solved in each of the iteration steps. It is demonstrated that the CG method without preconditioning converges in 37 iterations even when the dimension of a matrix is as large as 5, 184, 000. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The Energy Conserving Semi-Implicit Method (ECSIM) introduced by Lapenta (2017) has many advantageous properties compared to the classical semi-implicit and explicit PIC methods. Most importantly, energy conservation eliminates the growth of the finite grid instability. We have implemented ECSIM in a different and more efficient manner than the original approach. More importantly, we have addressed two major shortcomings of the original ECSIM algorithm: there is no mechanism to enforce Gauss's law and there is no mechanism to reduce the numerical oscillations of the electric field. A classical approach to satisfy Gauss's law is to modify the electric field and its divergence using either an elliptic or a parabolic/hyperbolic correction based on the Generalized Lagrange Multiplier method. This correction, however, violates the energy conservation property, and the oscillations related to the finite grid instability reappear in the modified ECSIM scheme. We invented a new alternative approach: the particle positions are modified instead of the electric field in the correction step. Displacing the particles slightly does not change the energy conservation property, while it can satisfy Gauss's law by changing the charge density. We found that the new Gauss's Law satisfying Energy Conserving Semi-Implicit Method (GL-ECSIM) produces superior results compared to the original ECSIM algorithm. In some simulations, however, there are still some numerical oscillations present in the electric field. We attribute this to the simple finite difference discretization of the energy conserving implicit electric field solver. We modified the spatial discretization of the field solver to reduce these oscillations while only slightly violating the energy conservation properties. We demonstrate the improved quality of the GL-ECSIM method with several tests. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Thermal Radiative Transfer (TRT) is the dominant energy transfer mechanism in high-energy density physics with applications in inertial confinement fusion and astrophysics. The stiff interactions between the material and radiation fields make TRT problems challenging to model. In this study, we propose a multi-dimensional extension of the deterministic particle (DP) method. The DP method combines aspects from both particle and deterministic methods. If the emission source is known a priori, and no physical scattering is present, the intensity of a particle can be integrated analytically. This introduces no statistical noise compared to Monte-Carlo methods, while maintaining the flexibility of particle methods. The method is closely related to the popular method of long characteristics. The combination of the DP-method with a discretely-consistent, nonlinear, gray low-order system enables an efficient solution algorithm for multi-frequency TRT problems. We demonstrate with numerical examples that the use of a linear-source approximation based on spatial moments improves the behavior of our method in the thick diffusion limit significantly.

AB This conceptual introduction to the Special Section examines different modes of 'tentative governance' of Emerging Science and Technology (EST). The notion of tentative governance appears particularly relevant in the case of EST, given all the uncertainties and dynamics related to the scientific base, technologies, possible innovations, societal benefits and potential risks. While one may argue that such uncertainties are not peculiar to EST, it is nevertheless apparent that in industry, society and public policy the level of awareness of these uncertainties has increased, largely as a result of experiences with former emerging technologies (e.g. genetically modified organisms, nuclear technology). Governance is 'tentative' when public and private interventions are designed as a dynamic process that is prudent and preliminary rather than assertive and persistent. Tentative governance typically aims at creating spaces for probing and learning instead of stipulating definitive targets. The paper suggests a heuristic to position and relate the contributions to this Special Section. One main finding emerging from those contributions is that the inherent contingency of EST requires rather tentative approaches to governance, though often in combination with more definitive modes of governance, with the exact mixture involving a balancing act.

AB Expectations and visions are known to be forceful elements in the governance of emerging innovations. However, visions and expectations are prone to change, thus creating challenges for strategy and policy processes. Actors have to deal with the dynamics of expectations, either ex-post when expectations have changed, or ex-ante, for instance by taking possible future changes into account in the design of policy measures. This article follows the dynamics of fuel cell expectations in the German policy discourse (1994-2011). Firstly, we study how fuel cell expectations were discursively related to a wider network of expectations regarding developments in the context of fuel cells. Secondly, we examine whether and how policy measures referred to these expectations, and how policy dealt with the dynamic evolution of expectations. We show that fuel cell expectations alone were not sufficient to trigger substantial policy support; only once they linked up with visions and expectations about the future energy system and further context developments were supportive policy measures initiated. Furthermore, although we observed dedicated and successful efforts to stabilize policy support for fuel cells pre-empting possible changes in expectations, governance still had to adapt to changes in the network of expectations, in particular the rise in expectations for battery-electric vehicles.

AB This paper develops a framework for characterising tentative and definitive governance modes. Using investor financing of UK-based therapeutic biotech firms as a context, the paper traces how policy makers have blended tentative and definitive elements in the design and implementation of six different kinds of policies to spur investor support for these firms. We find that tentative and definitive governance are used together to balance the need for certainty with necessary responsiveness to the dynamic circumstances that surround technological emergence. Moreover we show that the relative use of tentative and definitive modes is shaped as much by higher landscape-level influences as by technology or sector-level factors. Challenges are also identified, for instance, how to maintain synergistic rather than either/or relationships between state and non-state actors when both hesitate to engage with markets at different times.

ID SOCIETY SERIES; GOVERNMENT; NETWORKS
AB '`Governance' is a highly plastic concept that has spilled over from the political sciences and has been adopted, in some cases rather uncritically, by scholars from other social science traditions. We argue that there are limits to this all-pervasive notion of governance. Some of these limitations could potentially be addressed by the 'tentative governance' approach if it can create new opportunities for learning in order to cope with the problems of uncertainty at an early stage of new and emerging technologies in areas such as the life sciences. In order to move beyond these limits, we may be able to use the heuristic device offered by tentative governance as a step towards developing and adopting new rules of engagement. These new rules of engagement need (i) to recognise that consensus may not always be possible in areas of new and emerging technology and (ii) to accept a more balanced approach to governance that acknowledges the role of policy and politics. In order to achieve this, we need to go beyond science and technology studies (STS) and innovation studies and adopt a more interdisciplinary approach that acknowledges the contributions already made to this governance debate by a wide range of scholars, including those in the political sciences.

AB Requirements to integrate societal considerations into research and development practices began appearing throughout the democratic industrialized world in the early 2000s and eventually became a central feature of responsible innovation. Examining one of the earliest and most prominent policy examples, this paper investigates the conceptual basis of the U.S. nanotechnology program's mandate for socio-technical integration. It argues that policy makers adopted this innovative response to addressing the societal issues of an emerging technology due to their heightened awareness of potential interactions among public attitudes, research directions, and technological trajectories. Integration thus emerged as a governance mechanism for mediating the interaction between these dynamic sources of uncertainty. The mandate emerged in a self-consciously experimental and anticipatory manner and thus provides a practical instance of tentative governance.

AB In this paper, we study how the geography of venture capital (VC) and the location of entrepreneurial ventures affect the propensity of the latter to seek external equity financing. We analyse a sample of 533 European high-tech entrepreneurial ventures and examine their external equity-seeking behaviour in the 1984-2009 period. We find that ventures are more likely to seek external equity when the local availability of VC is higher, whereas the level of competition of the local VC market plays a negligible role. The stimulating effect of the availability of VC on the demand for external equity rapidly decreases with distance and vanishes at approximately 250 km. It also vanishes when national borders are crossed, except for countries at close cultural and institutional distance. Moreover, the distance decay of the stimulating effect of the availability of VC varies with the characteristics of prospective VC investors, namely, their private or public ownership and governance, and their reputation. These results have important implications for the policy that European countries and the European Commission should implement to foster the demand for VC by entrepreneurial ventures, thereby improving the functioning of the VC market in Europe.

AB This paper examines the effect of persistence in product and process innovations on the employment dynamics of a representative sample of Spanish manufacturing firms observed over more than 20 years. We build a conceptual framework that links innovation, its persistence, and different trajectories of employment growth. This framework suggests that firms might show different responses in terms of their employment growth and its persistence depending on the degree of persistence in their product and process innovations. We construct a synthetic indicator of innovation persistence at the firm-level and link this indicator to different employment trajectories. We find that persistence in product innovation affects both employment growth and the sustain ability of job creation over time significantly, whilst persistence in process innovation does not play any relevant role. Also, the positive effect of persistence in product innovation is particularly strong for SMEs. The evidence we provide supports the notion that product innovation is more effective in spurring sustained employment growth when carried out systematically.

AB We study research joint ventures (RJV) in a setting where knowledge spillovers increase with the technological proximity between firms. The scenarios we investigate differ in the intensity of collaboration which depends on the (non)coordination of research activities and the extent of exchanged knowledge. Finns can form bilateral RJVs what leads to the existence of insiders (collaborating firms) as well as outsiders (non-collaborating firms) in an oligopolistic market. Our central findings are (i) RJVs do not generally outperform competitive research with respect to innovative output and social welfare; (ii) technological proximity and the intensity of collaboration play a decisive role for the private and social benefits of a RJV; (iii) joint research combined with complete knowledge sharing does not generally outperform less intensive collaboration forms.

AB Mobile money innovations are expanding rapidly in developing countries, where they appear to be on track to extend financial services to billions of unbanked populations. However, adoption rates differ significantly across countries, and the success of innovations is also radically different within countries. To understand the factors that affect the development and diffusion of mobile money services, this study uses a mixed research method that combines cross-country data of adoption rates and an in-depth case study of a successful mobile money innovation. Quantitative analysis of adoption rates across countries indicates the varying role of institutional and economic factors on the adoption and usage of mobile money innovations. We undertake an in-depth study of M-Pesa in Kenya, one of the world's most known mobile money innovations, to gain nuanced understanding of the development and diffusion of the innovation. Analysis using the functional innovation system approach reveals the key role of the lead firm in guiding the innovation process, and the importance of a supportive regulatory environment that sought to advance financial inclusion. The results further reveal how the power and interest dynamics of key actors in the innovation system can shape the emergence of inclusive innovations that aim to address social issues.

   SUSTAINABILITY; INFRASTRUCTURE; EXPERIENCE
AB A founding assumption and aim of the sociotechnical approach to sustainability transitions was the need to develop frameworks to understand major systemic changes that would be required across the entire chain of production, distribution and consumption. However, most studies have so far focused on partial aspects of the entire chain, often a single, radical technology innovation. Therefore, since the founding ambition remains largely unrealized, the paper aims to contribute to transition scholarship by developing an approach for 'whole-system' analysis. As a second contribution, we argue that this broader unit of analysis calls for greater attention to the architecture of the system in terms of how constituent elements are linked to one another. To elaborate this point, we develop a reconfiguration approach, based on conceptual extensions to the multi-level perspective, analysing both techno-economic developments and socio-institutional developments. This approach draws attention to the multiplicity and interdependencies of change processes that constitute transitions, including incremental change, component substitution, symbiotic add-ons, knock-on effects and changes to the system architecture. A third contribution is to make an empirical whole-system analysis of the low-carbon reconfiguration of the UK electricity system between 1990 and 2016. This is important and timely, because it allows sociotechnical transition approaches to 'speak' at the same empirical whole-system level that dominates current long-term, low-carbon (modelling) analysis and associated political and public debate. This consequently enables a demonstration of the added value of the whole-system reconfiguration approach. Our findings show that early reconfiguration of the UK electricity system was dominated by modular changes within the generation and consumption subsystems; and more recently, how these earlier changes have triggered a new focus on the whole system architecture, anticipating deeper changes to the linkages between the generation, network and consumption subsystems.

AB This study investigates the relationship between government ideology and technical innovativeness of the whole country by using multinational panel data covering 110 countries from 1995 to 2015 and by employing comprehensive indicators for technical innovation, i.e. trademark and patent application in empirical research. We utilize the panel generalized method of moment (GMM) technique to introduce dynamic variables in order to avoid the bias caused by potential endogeneity. Next, we generate three cross items to examine whether the effect of government ideology on technical innovation differs under different circumstances. We then change the measurement of government ideology to assure the reliability of our empirical results, further investigate whether the changes of political ideology influence technical innovation, and carry out a robustness test by dividing the whole sample into two sub-samples based on the level of democracy, by employing two samples which limited by 3 main coalition parties in government at most, such as re-elected government and non alternated government in countries. Overall, the empirical results show that a leftist ruling party inhibits the progress of technical innovation, whereas a right-wing ruling party promotes the appearance of new technology. The effect of government ideology on innovation is not similar under some circumstances. More evidence is presented by using two dummy variables to represent left-wing and right-wing.

AB The recruitment of foreign-trained scientists enhances US science through an expanded workforce but could also cause harm by displacing better connected domestically-trained scientists, thereby reducing localized knowledge spillovers. We develop a model in which a sufficient condition for the absence of overall harm is that foreign trained scientists generate at least the same level of localized spillovers as the domestically-trained scientists they displace. To test this condition, we conduct a hypothetical experiment in which each foreign-trained displaces an appropriately matched domestically-trained scientist. Overall, we do not find evidence that foreign trained scientists harm US science by crowding out better-connected domestically-trained scientists, measured by citations by the US scientific community to their publications.

AB Research articles produced through international collaboration are more highly cited than other work, but are they also more novel? Using measures developed by Uzzi et al. (2013), and replicated by Boyack and Klavans (2014), this article tests for novelty and conventionality in international research collaboration. Scholars have found that coauthored articles are more novel and have suggested that diverse groups have a greater chance of producing creative work. As such, we expected to find that international collaboration tends to produce more novel research. Using data from Web of Science and Scopus in 2005, we failed to show that international collaboration tends to produce more novel articles. In fact, international collaboration appears to produce less novel and more conventional knowledge combinations. Transaction costs and communication barriers to international collaboration may suppress novelty. Higher citations to international work may be explained by an audience effect, where more authors from more countries results in greater access to a larger citing community. The findings are consistent with explanations of growth in international collaboration that posit a social dynamic of preferential attachment based upon reputation.

ID LIABILITY RULES; PROPERTY RULES; HOLDUP
AB The 2006 Supreme Court ruling in eBay vs. MercExchange removed the presumption of injunctive relief from infringement and marked a sea change in U.S. patent policy. Subsequent legal and policy changes reduced the costs of challenging patent validity and narrowed the scope of patentable subject matter. Proponents of these changes argue that they have made the U.S. patent system more equitable, particularly for sectors such as information technology, where patent ownership is fragmented and innovation highly cumulative. Opponents suggest the same reforms have weakened intellectual property rights and curtailed innovation. After reviewing the legal background and relevant economic theory, we examine patenting, R&D spending, venture capital investment and productivity growth in the wake of the eBay decision. Overall, we find no evidence that changes in patent policy have harmed the American innovation system.

Collaborations between (permanent) instrument scientists and users are at the core of these organisations, yet knowledge about the nature of such collaborations and their development over time is surprisingly scarce. In particular, we know very little about the interrelation between the individual and organisational drivers of collaboration. Based on a qualitative study of scientists and their collaborations at Institut Laue-Langevin, a world leading neutron source, we identify four typical collaboration patterns, which reflect particular configurations of (dis)similarity between instrument scientists and users in terms of perceived expertise gap and co-development focus. Our findings suggest that the co-existence of multiple collaboration types within the same organisation plays an important role in the long-term success of LSRIs. In addition, we contend that dissimilarity can generate productive collaboration to the same extent as partner similarity; not only at the organisational level - co-existence of different types of collaborations across the LSRI, favouring the co-existence of a broad range of instrumentation - but also at the individual level - where instrument scientists benefit in terms of more productive collaborations over time despite the cost of learning involved.

AB Current theorising about the contingencies underpinning the effectiveness of university technology transfer has emphasised the importance of organisational support, namely the scale of Technology Transfer Office (TTO) support and the provision of incentives. Empirical results pertaining to the effects of these organisational supports are mixed. More recently, academic research and policy reviews have highlighted the potential significance of the strategic choices made by university managers in contributing to the effectiveness of technology transfer activity. Our research attempts to reconcile these two streams of technology transfer research by drawing on Child's strategic choice theory as an integrating framework. Through operationalising a strategic choice framework and drawing upon data from 115 UK universities (collected through multiple waves of the HE-BCI Survey), this research shows that supporting organisational infrastructure is necessary but not sufficient to account for improved technology transfer effectiveness. Specifically, it highlights the key mediating role of strategic choice, suggesting that it is the alignment between strategic choices made by university managers and the supporting organisational infrastructure that accounts for variations in technology transfer effectiveness. Furthermore, we find the mediation relationship between strategic alignment and technology transfer effectiveness is moderated by the breadth of strategic planning efforts, with those universities that engage a wider number of faculty in strategic planning efforts benefiting most from the alignment between strategic choices and supporting organisational infrastructure.

AB There is now substantial evidence of the positive contribution universities can make to helping firms' innovation. Building university-business collaborations, however, confronts the 'two-worlds' paradox, and the difference in institutional logics and priorities between businesses and universities. Here, we consider whether firms' experience from prior collaboration can generate learning which can help to overcome the two-worlds paradox and improve firms' ability to generate new-to-the-market innovations in collaboration with universities. Our analysis is based on panel data for UK companies and controls for the decision to innovate. We find evidence of significant learning effects which both increase the probability that firms collaborating with universities are able to develop new-to-the-market innovations and then benefit from those innovations. For smaller firms learning effects are strongest from prior collaboration with customers, while for medium and larger firms the strongest learning effects arise from prior collaboration with consultants.

AB The polyamide-polyacrylate system is one of the most industrially applied substrate-adhesive systems in the microelectronics industry. The utilization of polyacrylate-based adhesives has grown significantly as interfacial material for mechanical support and as protective layers against foreign materials and chemical damage. Herein, we evaluate the adhesion between a pressure-sensitive polyacrylate-based adhesive and a polyamide substrate, and the effect of residual silicone, introduced as the adhesive material release agent. Spectral signatures of the polyacrylate-silicone intercalation, densification and fracture were determined via time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (ToF-SIMS). Moreover, the nature and the integrity of the interfacial interaction between polyacrylate and polyamide in the presence of residual silicone after pressure application and adhesive curing were elucidated. The observed adhesion loss was rationalized based on the surface determinants derived from these spectral signatures. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The chemical graft between PAG and PANI, and the electrostatic incorporation between PANI inter-chains could provide the stable structural foundation for the improvement of cyclic stability. HCl and 1,5-naphthalene sulfonic acid (NSA) were both used as dopants to guarantee high doping level of PANI. The PAG/PANI electrode had a high specific capacitance of 1092.3 F g(-1) at 5 mV s(-1), and also showed a high cyclic stability after 3000 cycles. These results indicated that the PAG/PANI electrode would have a broad application prospect in energy storage device. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Solid-state secondary batteries employing solid electrolytes provide the advantage to be potentially more stable than conventional batteries and hence are safer. At present, investigations of related ionic conductivities of solid ion conductors are attracting attention. In this work, we have prepared SmF3 with CaF2 doped materials. Different Sm1-xCaxF3-x compositions which are dependent on the stoichiometric ratio (0 <= x <= 0.15) had been obtained by planetary high-energy mechanochemical milling. Structural, morphology and ionic conductivities of the synthesized Sm1-xCaxF3-x electrolytes were examined. From X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM), it was revealed that Sm1-xCaxF3-x constitutes in a tysonite-type structure with a crystallite size of around 10-20 nm and an average particle size of 50 nm. At room temperature, the highest ionic conductivity was achieved for Sm0.95Ca0.05F2.95 of 2.8.10(-5) S cm(-1). The corresponding activation energy was extracted to be 0.40 eV. Finally, a proof-of-principle solid-state Fluoride Ion Battery (FIB) had been tested based on a CeF3/Sm0.95Ca0.05F2.95/Bi electrochemical system. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB In this work, we have put forward a novel heterogeneous interface induced formation strategy to prepare balsam pear-like polypyrrole (PPy) film by using binary electrodeposition. The as-prepared PPy film exhibited a balsam pear-like structure with plenty of vertically aligned serrations and offered a longer conjugation length of PPy chains. Beneficial from the reasonable structure, the serrated PPy (SE-PPy) provided abundant electro-active contact area with the electrolyte, thus leading to the ultrafast-spreading of electrolyte ions and high utilization efficiency of active electrode. Based on this, the SE-PPy electrode showed outstanding electrochemical performance with a large specific capacitance of 773.6 F/g at 1 A/g in 1 M KOH electrolyte, and still retains similar to 77.6% of its initial capacitance at a high current density of 20 A/g, which is superior to the reported PPy and most of PPy-related electrodes.

AB This work reports a fluorine-free superhydrophobic carbon-based emulsion coated on the concrete surface via mixing B-doped carbon particle (BCP) aggregations and natural metakaolin (MK) in the polyvinyl alcohol medium. The BCP aggregations were fabricated by two-step hydrothermal processes without using toxic chemicals such as fluorine/silicon-based materials. Structure and element analyses confirmed boron doping boosts the formation of micro-nano roughness in BCP aggregations. With MK addition, the hierarchical undulating texture was formed and endowed the carbon-based coating with excellent superhydrophobicity of WCA = 156 degrees. When coated on the concrete surface, the resultant carbon-based materials would have a potential application in the ocean buildings to prevent from permeation and corrosion. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this work, monodispersed silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) were prepared by the reaction of silver nitrate with alkali hydrolyzed pectin at microwave irradiation. Two types of Ag NPs were obtained under the following conditions: 400W of microwave power, 1 g/l NaOH, 2 g/l pectin, 10 mmol/l AgNO3, and irradiation time for 1 and 2 min, respectively. The zeta potential values of Ag NPs colloidal solutions were -39.6 and -38.7 mV, indicating that these nanoparticles were stable. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis revealed these spherical Ag NPs with an average size 2.90 and 11.94 nm, respectively. Ag NPs exhibited potent antibacterial and antifungal activities to against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Aspergillus japonicus, and the minimum bactericidal concentrations (MIC) to against E. coli and S. aureus were equally at 80-160 mg/ml. In a word, this is a green, efficient, and cost-effective method for Ag NPs synthesis. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Although fluorinated carbon fiber (FC) inherits many excellent properties of carbon materials, and holds great promise in many fields. However, chemical modification and application of FC in biomedicine have been rarely studied, mostly ascribed to large-sized needle-like structure, and inert C-F bonds with strong hydrophobicity. Herein, fluorinated carbon fiber oxide (FCO) enriched with oxygen groups with an average size of 90 nm is prepared, and this then allows us for the first time to modify FCO with biomolecule of hyaluronic acid, rendering FCO special targeting and good dispersibility in various media. Effective control over structure and surface makes FCO exhibit negligible toxicity and possess high near infrared absorption for photothermal therapy (PTT). Moreover, FCO also has high drug load capacity (1.05 mg/mg), and cell experiments confirm better therapeutic effect of the nanocarrier than single PTT or chemotherapy, making it practically valuable for cancer chemo-photothermal therapy.

AB In this study, the thickness of the high-Ga content CuIn0.5Ga0.5Se2 (CIGS) absorber is optimized for highly efficient wide-bandgap CISG solar cells. Wide-bandgap (1.3 eV) CIGS solar cell with the highest efficiency of 16.3% and short circuit current density (J(SC)) of 31.4 mA/cm(2) is fabricated using a CIGS absorber as thin as 1.6 mu m. The highest open circuit voltage (V-oc) of 762 mV is achieved using a 1.2 mu m thick CIGS absorber without alkali post deposition treatment, but the efficiency is only 14.8% due to the low J(SC). The crystallinity of the wide-bandgap CIGS absorber is enhanced gradually by reducing the thickness of CIGS absorber from 2.2 to 1.2 mu m as confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The carrier collection length of the CIGS solar cells is found to increase gradually from thinning the CIGS absorber as revealed by scanning electron microscope equipped with electron-beam-induced current detector (SEM-EBIC).

AB Polymer supported metal thin films for flexible and stretchable applications need to have exceptional electro-mechanical behavior. Typically, brittle metal films thicker than 300 nm will fail at low strains. It will be demonstrated that with residual stress and microstructural tuning, a 500 nm thick Mo film on polyimide has a high crack onset strain and does not fail electrically after 1000 tensile straining cycles of 1% due to a novel zig-zag microstructure. The zig-zag microstructure imparts a crack deflecting behavior which ensures longer lifetimes. As a consequence, a high crack onset strain does not indicate better behavior under cyclic loading conditions. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The monodisperse hollow TiO2 spheres (HTS) were fabricated by facile template-free route involving direct precipitation and etching reaction. Tetrabutyl titanate was used as titanium precursor to form amorphous TiO2 spheres (ATS) directly in ethanol-acetonitrile mixed solution. Then, the ATS were etched by F- with the protection of PVP to form HTS under hydrothermal reaction conditions. The physical and chemical characterizations of synthesized samples were conducted by SEM, TEM, XRD and UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. Result showed that morphology and structure of HTS can be easily controlled by adjusting time of etching reaction. The HTS obtained by etching for 4 h exhibited good hollow structure with unique shell assembled with enriched nanothorns, and it possessed good photocatalytic activity under visible light irradiation.
