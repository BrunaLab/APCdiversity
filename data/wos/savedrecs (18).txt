AB OBJECTIVE: Dexamethasone (DEXA) has been widely used in the management of peritumoral brain edema. DEXA, however, has many systemic side effects and can interact negatively with glioma therapy. Progesterone (PROG), however, is a well-tolerated and readily accessible anti-inflammatory and antiedema agent, with potent neuroprotective properties. We investigated whether PROG could serve as a viable alternative to DEXA in the management of peritumoral brain edema.
   METHODS: We used an orthotopic C6 glioblastoma model with male Sprague-Dawley rats. Tumor grafts were allowed to grow for 14 days before drug treatment with DEXA 1 mg/kg, PROG 10 mg/kg, or PROG 20 mg/kg for 5 consecutive days. The overall animal survival and neurologic function were evaluated. Mechanistic studies on blood-brain barrier permeability and angiogenic responses were performed on the ex vivo tumor grafts.
   RESULTS: We found that all drug treatments prolonged overall survival to different extents. PROG 10 mg led to significantly longer survival and better preservation of neurologic function and body weight. The blood-brain barrier permeability was better preserved with PROG 10 mg than with DEXA, possibly through downregulation of matrix metalloproteinase-9 and aquaporin-4 expression. Antiangiogenic responses were also observed in the PROG group.
   CONCLUSIONS: The present proof-of-concept pilot study has provided novel information on the use of PROG as a corticosteroid-sparing agent in brain tumor management. Further translational and clinical studies are warranted.

AB OBJECTIVE: Despite increasing use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), guidelines for their perioperative use in spine surgery are still lacking. The main goal of our study was to analyze the occurrence of postoperative bleeding events and possible confounders in patients treated with DOACs who undergo spine surgery.
   METHODS: Of 2777 patients undergoing spine surgery at our institution, 82 (2.9%) were treated with DOACs. The primary endpoint was postoperative bleeding events. Secondary outcome measures were postoperative thromboembolic events and anemia, hematologic findings, perioperative packed red blood cell substitution, operative time, hospital length of stay, morbidity, and mortality. Subanalysis of possible confounders affecting the rates of bleeding was also performed. Additionally, correlation of bleeding event rates and preoperative and postoperative discontinuation of DOACs was analyzed.
   RESULTS: Overall postoperative bleeding events rate was 4.9% (n = 4). Preoperative DOAC discontinuation time of <24 hours increased significantly the rate of perioperative packed red blood cell substitution (P = 0.007). Treatment with concomitant blood thinners showed a trend toward higher incidence of bleeding events (P = 0.066), whereas pre-existing kidney failure increased significantly rates of postoperative anemia (P = 0.014). The rate of postoperative thromboembolic events was 4.9% (n = 4); all events occurred with DOAC resumption >72 hours postoperatively.
   CONCLUSIONS: Short preoperative discontinuation time of DOACs, even <24 hours, may be justified, considering an increased risk of perioperative packed red blood cell substitution. Care should be taken with patients treated with concomitant blood thinners and patients with pre-existing kidney disease. Postoperative DOAC resumption >72 hours may increase risk of thromboembolic events.

AB OBJECTIVE: Spinal metastases represent the most common site of bony metastases and frequently reduce quality of life. A beneficial effect of surgery and radiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone has been demonstrated in symptomatic patients. The goal of our study was to perform a cost-utility analysis of surgery for spinal metastases based on patient-level costs and health status data in a specialist spine center in Belgium.
   METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was performed in a prospective cohort of patients undergoing surgery for symptomatic spinal metastases in 2011-2015. EQ-5D-3L measure of health-related quality of life data were collected preoperatively and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months. Hospital costs relating to surgical management including postoperative radiotherapy were analyzed. A retrospective cohort of patients treated with radiotherapy alone between 2011 and 2015, which matched the surgical patients for disease load and presentation, also was assessed. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for nonsurgical patients were modelled against the surgical group.
   RESULTS: In total, 38 consecutive surgical patients had information for cost-utility analysis and 8 nonsurgical patients were matched. Mean total cost in the surgical group was (sic)16,989 (SD (sic)8148), largely comprising nonmedical staffing cost (mean (sic)7721, 45.9%), followed by daily operational costs ((sic)2963, 17.6%) and medical staffing costs ((sic)2621, 15.6%). Median initial health status was 0.33 (interquartile range 0.15-0.55), and median postoperative QALYs were 0.70 (interquartile range 0.18-1.70). Mean total cost in the nonsurgical cohort was (sic)9354. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for surgical management was (sic)13,635 (range (sic)12,726-(sic)14,407) per QALY.
   CONCLUSIONS: Surgery for symptomatic spinal metastases in a specialist hospital in Belgium is cost-effective.

ID SURGICAL-TREATMENT; ONYX EMBOLIZATION; STEREOTACTIC RADIOSURGERY;
   ENDOVASCULAR TREATMENT; CLINICAL-COURSE; SURGERY; RISK; MANAGEMENT; ERA
AB BACKGROUND: An integrated multimodality approach can be effective in treatment of high-grade dural arteriovenous fistulas. Nevertheless, this requires a high level of efficient cooperation between different departments, underlying a degree of bias in the decisional process. In comparison, hybrid capability, integrating these modalities in one hand, may allow aggregating multimodality treatment strategies by pooling their individual benefits, leading to a more holistic view of the consequences of each modality.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 18 cases of dural arteriovenous fistulas subjected to a hybrid treatment approach at the Diakonieklinikum Jung-Stilling, Siegen, Germany, between March 2008 and January 2017. Nine cases were excluded. We selected 4 cases that highlight different aspects of hybrid capability for illustrative purposes.
   RESULTS: Hybrid capability allows treatment of a dural arteriovenous fistula based on the individual clinical situation of the patient and features of the lesion, free of interdepartmental bias. The surgeon maintains a level of flexibility that enables him or her to move from a minimally invasive endovascular approach to a maximally invasive surgical access according to the specific situation. Hybrid capability can lead to a highly efficient treatment regimen with palliation of symptoms and complete obliteration of the fistula, improving performance in these complex pathologies.
   CONCLUSIONS: Hybrid capability has great potential in the treatment of complex neurovascular lesions. It remains to be seen if a single surgeon with hybrid capability can supersede the current multidepartmental practice and achieve better outcomes.

ID ENDOSCOPY
AB OBJECTIVE: Three-dimensional (3D), high-definition (HD) endoscopy has been recently introduced in neurosurgery, and its value has been discussed extensively in endonasal skull base surgery. Because there has been no reported clinical series on the use of a recent 3D-HD ventriculoscope, the aim of this study was to describe our initial experience with this novel device.
   METHODS: Patients consecutively operated on from June 2016 to June 2018 with a 3D-HD ventriculoscope were prospectively collected. The system is a 6-mm, 0-degree optic with a 105-degree field of view, with a central working channel of 2.2-mm diameter and 2 side channels of 1.3-mm diameter. Patients' demographic data, preoperative symptoms, and neurologic status; neuroradiologic data; type of surgery; operative time; intraoperative and postoperative complications, and follow-up data were prospectively recorded and retrospectively reviewed.
   RESULTS: Twenty-four patients (age range: 3-84 years) underwent 25 procedures including endoscopic third ventriculocisternostomy, biopsy, and cyst fenestration. The technical goal of surgery was obtained in all patients. There were no intraoperative complications, expect for 1 intraoperative epileptic seizure. Postoperative complications included asymptomatic subdural collections in 2 patients, infection, and delayed endoscopic third ventriculocisternostomy closure in 1 patient each.
   Relative limits of the system are its size and the availability of only a 0-degree optic. Image quality appeared satisfactory in all procedures. The lack of a dedicated introducer was resolved, exploiting a vascular "peelaway" system.
   CONCLUSIONS: 3D-HD technology seems to provide potential advantages in ventricular surgery. This initial experience is promising but must be confirmed by larger series.

ID PATENCY
AB BACKGROUND: Posterior communicating artery segment aneurysms are one of the most frequent intracranial aneurysms. Currently, limited data have described the use of the pipeline embolization device (PED) in these aneurysms.
   METHODS: We conducted a multicenter retrospective review of 3 prospectively collected databases of patients treated with the PED from January 2013 to December 2017. The primary objective was to assess the efficacy and safety of the PED in the treatment of saccular posterior communicating artery (PComA) aneurysms. We also assessed the effect of anatomical variations on the angiographic and clinical outcomes, including the presence of fetal PComA, vessel origin relationship to the aneurysm, and patency after PED placement.
   RESULTS: We identified 57 patients with 60 saccular aneurysms; Their mean age was 60.5 years, and 49 were female (86.0%). A total of 55 aneurysms (91.7%) were unruptured. The median imaging follow-up duration was 8.5 months. Complete occlusion at the last imaging follow-up study was 84.0%. At the last follow-up examination, 94.5% of patients had a modified Rankin scale score of <= 2. The presence of fetal PComA, origin type, and patency during follow-up did have a significant effect on aneurysm occlusion (P = 0.61, P = 0.40, and P = 0.14, respectively).
   CONCLUSIONS: PED use for treatment of PComA aneurysms resulted in acceptable occlusion rates. The present study did not find that fetal PComA, its origin, or its patency during follow-up had an effect on aneurysm occlusion.

AB OBJECTIVE: Grading of epidural fibrosis (EF) is usually performed by histopathologic staining in experimental studies. Immunohistochemical methods for grading are not available in routine practice yet. In our study, the effect of tranexamic acid (TXA), a commonly used hemostatic agent in surgical interventions, was evaluated for use against the development of EF with classical histopathologic methods and immunohistochemistry using the CD105 antibody, a marker of angiogenesis.
   METHODS: Sixteen rats were used. The rats were assigned to 2 groups, control and TXA. Laminectomy was performed on the control group. In the treatment group, laminectomy + topical TXA was applied. After sacrificing the rats in the sixth week, histopathologic and immunohistochemical examinations and grading of the EF tissue were performed.
   RESULTS: Conventional histopathologic parameters of fibroblast count, intensity of fibrosis density, and inflammatory cell density, as well as immunohistochemical evaluation with CD105, showed that the grading of EF was comparable between groups I and II (P < 0.001).
   DISCUSSION: The results of our study have demonstrated that CD105 is compatible with the conventional histopathologic grading methods and can be used as a marker to determine the grades of angiogenesis and fibrosis in experimental studies. The results of our study have also shown that TXA, administered locally for hemostasis, reduces the grade of EF in rats following laminectomy. TXA has been observed to cause no toxic effects on neural tissue as it is already commonly used in clinical practice.

AB OBJECTIVE: We sought to compare clinical outcomes of robot-assisted versus conventional freehand fluoroscopy-assisted lumbar pedicle screw insertion in patients with osteoporosis.
   METHODS: This study included 80 patients with osteoporosis and lumbar disease treated with pedicle screw internal fixation in the Department of Spine Surgery, Beijing Jishuitan Hospital between June 2016 and July 2018. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either robot-assisted pedicle screw insertion (experimental group) or freehand fluoroscopy-assisted pedicle screw insertion (control group). The accuracy of screw placement was assessed with postoperative computed tomography. Operative time, pedicle screw placement time, radiation exposure to the medical team, and intraoperative blood loss were recorded.
   RESULTS: A total of 427 pedicle screws were inserted in 80 patients; 202 pedicle screws were placed in the experimental group, and 225 pedicle screws were placed in the control group. The accuracy of screw placement was significantly higher with robot-assisted pedicle screw insertion (98.5% [199/202]) compared with that achieved with the freehand technique (91.6% [206/225]) (P < 0.05). Robot-assisted pedicle screw insertion was associated with reductions in the mean total pedicle screw placement time (27.60 +/- 8.58 vs. 32.26 +/- 10.48 minutes), radiation exposure to the medical team (2.23 +/- 0.62 vs. 3.35 +/- 0.80 fluoroscopic images), and intraoperative blood loss (254.75 +/- 115.34 vs. 356.25 +/- 141.00 mL; P < 0.05). The mean operative time did not differ significantly between the groups.
   CONCLUSIONS: Robot-assisted pedicle screw insertion is a more effective surgical option for patients with osteoporosis who present with various spine diseases compared with fluoroscopy-assisted freehand screw placement techniques.

AB BACKGROUND: Antiplatelet therapy is common and complicates the operative management of subdural hematomas (SDH). The risk of reoperation inferred by antiplatelet medication and the ability of platelet transfusion to reduce hemorrhagic complications in patients presenting with antiplatelet associated SDHs are poorly defined.
   METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of consecutive patients treated with craniotomy or craniectomy for evacuation of an acute or mixed-density SDH between 2012 and 2017 at 2 academic institutions. Exclusion criteria included anticoagulant therapy, thrombocytopenia, and/or international normalized ratio >1.3. Clinical and radiographic data were collected; primary endpoint was reoperation within 30 days. Logistic regression models were used to identify predictors of reoperation.
   RESULTS: A total of 195 patients were included: 86 patients on antiplatelet medication and 109 with no antithrombotic history. Overall, 24 (12.3%) of patients required a reoperation. Reoperation rate in patients on antiplatelet medication was not significantly different than those not on antithrombotics (14.0% vs. 11.0%, P = 0.53). Patients taking antiplatelet medication were significantly older, more likely to have medical comorbidities, and more likely to receive preoperative platelet transfusion (36.0% vs. 3.7%, P < 0.001). Of patients taking antiplatelet medications, there was no difference in reoperation rate between those patients receiving preoperative platelet transfusion and those not receiving transfusion (16.1% vs. 12.7%, P = 0.75).
   CONCLUSIONS: Antiplatelet medication was not a significant predictor of reoperation following evacuation of an acute or mixed-density SDH. In patients on antiplatelet medication, preoperative platelet transfusion did not reduce reoperation rates.

AB BACKGROUND: Ventral lesions of upper thoracic spinal cord due to degenerative diseases are rare and often have poor operative outcomes. Anterior decompression of the lesion is difficult because of the local anatomy. This retrospective study aimed to evaluate reproducible anatomic measurements for selecting the best surgical approach for anterior decompression of ventral lesions of upper thoracic spinal cord.
   METHODS: Cases of anterior decompression of ventral lesions of upper thoracic spinal cord due to degenerative diseases at our institution from 2004 to 2015 were assessed. Several lines were drawn on magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography scans of midsagittal sections of the upper thoracic spine to evaluate the most optimal approach for treating upper thoracic lesions. A line from the suprasternal notch to the vertebral body (suprasternal notch to vertebral body [SV] line) was accepted as baseline.
   RESULTS: The caudal edge of the lesion was above the SV line in 10 cases, each of which was treated via an anterior approach without sternotomy. The caudal edge was below the SV line in 7 cases, 5 of which underwent surgery with the sternum-splitting or transthoracic approach. The other 2 lesions were approached via an obliquely deviated route without sternotomy. The SV line sometimes changed with patients' posture alterations.
   CONCLUSIONS: The SV line, a useful landmark for upper thoracic lesions, is not sufficiently reliable because it changes according to the patient's posture. By leaning in the direction of the surgical microscope, more caudal upper thoracic lesions can be reached than when using the SV line as a surgical landmark.

AB OBJECTIVE: To explore the efficacy and safety of Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) for meningiomas in patients with neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2).
   METHODS: A series of 35 consecutive patients with 99 meningiomas in our department were retrospectively included from January 2000 to December 2015. Clinical records, magnetic resonance images, and follow-up data were reviewed.
   RESULTS: A total of 35 patients (25 women and 10 men) with 99 NF2-associated meningiomas were identified. All patients initially received GKRS. The patients' median age at the time of GKRS was 40 years (range, 16-61 years). The median prescription dose at the tumor margin was 13 Gy (range, 12-15 Gy). The median follow-up time was 96 months (range, 25-224 months). Twenty-nine patients received GKRS only once, and 6 patients received it multiple times. Six patients (17.1%) had radiation-related complications 7.5 +/- 2.4 months after GKRS. Local control rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 100%, 97.1%, and 90.6%, respectively. Distant control rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 88.5%, 55.9%, and 45.5%, respectively. Five patients died of concomitant neurologic symptoms. No malignant transformation was observed during the follow-up periods in all 35 patients.
   CONCLUSIONS: GKRS represents an effective and safe management strategy with minimal invasion for patients with NF2-associated meningiomas. Our data showed a high local control rate of NF2-associated meningiomas by GKRS; however, the distant control rate is low, especially in young patients. For these patients, retreatment with GKRS may still be the advisable method.

   resonance imaging; Vestibular schwannoma
ID FACIAL-NERVE; TUMORS; TRACT; DIFFERENTIATION; PREDICTION; GLIOMAS
AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate the validity of various approaches to extract quantitative measurements of diffusion imaging (i.e., apparent diffusion coefficient [ADC]) to investigate tumors of the central nervous system. In current studies, the region of interest (ROI) for the quantitative measurements are placed arbitrarily according to morphology. Our aim is to investigate how placement patterns influence the ADC estimation in intracranial tumors.
   METHODS: Twenty consecutive patients affected by vestibular schwannoma were studied using diffusion imaging. ADC values were obtained using different ROI placement methods: segmentation ADC values of the entire volume (vADC), random ADC values were obtained in 10 different ROI points, and a single ROI in the ADC of the internal auditory canal portion of the tumor.
   RESULTS: ADC of the internal auditory canal portion of the tumor and vADC differed significantly (P < 0.01). vADC was different between cystic and microcystic schwannomas (P = 0.009) and between cystic and solid schwannomas (P = 0.006).
   CONCLUSIONS: The positioning of ROI in these measurements is pivotal. Although "whole tumor volume" measurements represent the largest amount of information, multiple seed points can be used as well. However, there must be multiple seeds and their placement must be reported. ADC can be used as a versatile tool for tumor assessment but must be used judiciously and structured to yield comparable results.

AB OBJECTIVE: Immediate postoperative and early clinical outcome of treatment of spinal kyphoscoliosis (SKS) associated with Chiari formation (CF) and syringomyelia (SM) and treated by atlantoaxial fixation is described.
   METHODS: During the period April 2016 to March 2018, 11 patients with SKS as a major presenting symptom in association with CF and SM were surgically treated and are analyzed retrospectively. The patients were 6 boys and 5 girls, and their ages ranged from 11-17 years (average 14 years). Six patients (54.5%) had associated neurologic symptoms and 9 patients had neck pain. All patients were treated by atlantoaxial fixation. No manipulation of foramen magnum bone or dura was performed. No surgery was performed on the subaxial cervical or dorsal spine. Patient Satisfaction Score was based on a specially designed questionnaire. Other outcome measures included clinical and radiologic assessment data, clinical photographs and video observation, and a Scoliosis Research Society Questionnaire.
   RESULTS: Apart from improvement in neurologic condition, more particularly in breathing capability and voice volume restoration, all patients and their relatives noticed recovery in SKS in the immediate postoperative phase. During the average follow-up of 14 months, all patients continued to have progressive symptomatic recovery and recovery from SKS. Patient Satisfaction Score suggested that all patients were 'highly' satisfied with the surgical outcome.
   CONCLUSIONS: Atlantoaxial fixation in patients with CF and SM associated with SKS results in reversal of several musculoskeletal and neural abnormalities that includes recovery from spinal deformity.

AB OBJECTIVE: Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) can be associated with a degree of resulting brain damage and subsequent reorganization of the central nervous system. The aim of this study was to evaluate complication rates and clinical outcome in patients with a previous SAH who were treated for a recurrent or an additional, initially unruptured aneurysm.
   METHODS: A retrospective single-center study was conducted for patients who underwent elective treatment by surgical or endovascular means between 2010 and 2018. We compared patients with a previous SAH and without history of SAH in terms of complication rates and functional outcomes (modified Rankin Scale [mRS]).
   RESULTS: The study population consisted of 337 patients (non-SAH, 270; SAH, 67) who underwent 390 elective procedures for treatment of 443 aneurysms. Procedure-related complications occurred in 13.5% of patients with a previous SAH and in 13.3% of patients without SAH (P = 1.0). At the 6-month follow-up, the morbidity (defined as any increase on the mRS) was comparable between the SAH group (6.7%) and the non-SAH group (7.6%; P = 0.5). Overall favorable outcome (mRS score <= 2) was achieved by 96.6% in the SAH group and 97.3% in the non-SAH group (P = 1.0). Also, in patients with a previous SAH, the choice of clipping or endovascular treatment did not have a significant impact on clinical outcome at the 6-month follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of recurrent or additional aneurysms in patients with a previous SAH can be performed with acceptable complication rates and morbidity by either surgical or endovascular means.

AB BACKGROUND: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) can reduce motor symptoms in patients with Parkinson disease (PD) and improve their health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The effect of STN DBS on activities of daily living (ADL), an important component of quality of life, is poorly understood. We aimed to investigate effects of STN DBS on HRQoL and ADL in patients with PD.
   METHODS: HRQoL and ADL were assessed using the following disease-specific and generic questionnaires at baseline and 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery: the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire 39 (PDQ-39), the Short-Form 36 health survey questionnaire, the World Health Organization Quality of Life Scale-Brief version, the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part II, the ADL scale, and the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scale.
   RESULTS: We reported significant early improvements (3 months) in the HRQoL and ADL, and these benefits increased over time (6 months); however, further improvement between 6 and 12 months was nonsignificant. Two PDQ-39 subdomains (social support and communications) and a Short-Form 36 health survey questionnaire subdomain (social functioning) showed declines after surgery. Changes in the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scale were significantly correlated with changes in the PDQ-39 summary index and other PDQ-39 subdomains, including mobility, emotional well-being, social support, and cognition, at all follow-up points.
   CONCLUSIONS: STN DBS caused a marked improvement in HRQoL at 3 and 6 months; however, HRQoL remained stable at the 12-month postoperative follow-up. Moreover, we have shown a significant correlation between ADL performance and HRQoL after STN DBS.

AB BACKGROUND: Dysphagia is a common complication after anterior cervical discectomy surgery (ACDS). Recent studies have shown that reducing the endotracheal tube cuff pressure, local irrigation with methylprednisolone, and minimizing the pharynx/esophagus retraction can decrease the incidence of postoperative dysphagia after ACDS. This is the first study assessing the efficacy of all these 3 measures simultaneously.
   METHODS: This prospective study included 35 patients (group 1) who underwent ACDS with the adoption of all the 3 preventive measures. Group 1 was compared with a homogenous group of 35 patients who underwent regular ACDS (group 2). Postoperative dysphagia and odynophagia were evaluated after 2, 7, and 14 days and 3, 6, and 12 months. Age, gender, body mass index (BMI), operating time, blood loss, and preoperative Japanese Orthopaedic Association score were collected.
   RESULTS: Postoperative dysphagia was observed in 3 cases (8.6%) in group 1 and 15 cases (42.9%) in group 2 (P < 0.05). Three patients in group 1 had transient dysphagia with complete resolution at the last follow-up whereas 6 patients in group 2 (17.1%) had permanent dysphagia (P < 0.05). Nine patients (25.7%) in group 2 presented with transient dysphagia with complete resolution at the last follow-up. The mean visual analog scale for odynophagia was significantly lower in group 1 compared with group 2 (P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative dysphagia occurs frequently after ACDS. We show that the adoption of preventive measures during surgery can reduce the rate of dysphagia. Future evaluations in a large clinical trial are mandatory.

   STRATEGIES; INVASION; SURGERY
AB OBJECTIVE: Sphenoid wing meningiomas are the third most common group of intracranial meningiomas. Their management is a challenge because of their bone invasion potential and their proximity to neurovascular structures and the cavernous sinus.
   METHODS: A cohort of 141 patients with sphenoid wing meningioma who were operated on and followed up between 1986 and 2018 were retrospectively analyzed. Demographic data, clinical and radiologic features, surgical results, and follow-up data are presented. The effects of adjuvant treatments (radiosurgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy) are reviewed. The invasion pattern of tumors and other factors were noted to analyze the extent of resection. Recurrence/regrowth rates were also analyzed.
   RESULTS: There were 96 female and 45 male patients with a median age of 51 years (range, 17-87 years). The median follow-up was 62 months (range, 1-303 months). Tumors were grouped as spheno-orbital (31 patients), lateral (34 patients), middle (35 patients), and medial (41 patients). Gross total resection was achieved in 98 patients, and 43 tumors were resected subtotally. One hundred and twenty of these cases had World Health Organization grade I pathology, whereas the remainder had grade II. In the follow-up, there were 14 recurrences of totally resected tumors, and 24 regrowths were observed in the subtotally resected group. No invasion pattern was strongly predictive of extent of resection alone, and a scoring system was built up and proposed.
   CONCLUSIONS: Sphenoid wing meningioma is a large group with characteristics associated with skull base meningiomas and convexity meningiomas. The results of surgery and other adjuvant treatments are heterogeneous.

AB OBJECTIVE: Computer-assisted three-dimensional navigation often guides spinal instrumentation. Optical topographic imaging (OTI) offers comparable accuracy and significantly faster registration relative to current navigation systems in open posterior thoracolumbar exposures. We validate the usefulness and accuracy of OTI in minimally invasive spinal approaches.
   METHODS: Mini-open midline posterior exposures were performed in 4 human cadavers. Square exposures of 25, 30, 35, and 40 mm were registered to preoperative computed tomography imaging. Screw tracts were fashioned using a tracked awl and probe with instrumentation placed. Navigation data were compared with screw positions on postoperative computed tomography imaging, and absolute translational and angular deviations were computed.
   In vivo validation was performed in 8 patients, with mini-open thoracolumbar exposures and percutaneous placement of navigated instrumentation. Navigated instrumentation was performed in the previously described manner.
   RESULTS: For 37 cadaveric screws, absolute translational errors were (1.79 +/- 1.43 mm) and (1.81 +/- 1.51 mm) in the axial and sagittal planes, respectively. Absolute angular deviations were (3.81 +/- 2.91 degrees) and (3.45 +/- 2.82 degrees), respectively (mean +/- standard deviation). The number of surface points registered by the navigation system, but not exposure size, correlated positively with the likelihood of successful registration (odds ratio, 1.02; 95% confidence interval, 1.009-1.024; P < 0.001).
   Fifty-five in vivo thoracolumbar pedicle screws were analyzed. Overall (mean +/- standard deviation) axial and sagittal translational errors were (1.79 +/- 1.41 mm) and (2.68 +/- 2.26 mm), respectively. Axial and sagittal angular errors were (3.63 degrees +/- 2.92 degrees) and (4.65 degrees +/- 3.36 degrees), respectively. There were no radiographic breaches >2 mm or any neurovascular complications.
   CONCLUSIONS: OTI is a novel navigation technique previously validated for open posterior exposures and in this study has comparable accuracy for mini-open minimally invasive surgery exposures. The likelihood of successful registration is affected more by the geometry of the exposure than by its size.

AB OBJECTIVE: To identify clinical and radiographic features of subtypes of acute proximal junctional failures (PJFs) following correction surgery for degenerative sagittal imbalance.
   METHODS: The study included 157 patients with mean age 68.0 +/- 6.3 years who underwent correction surgery for degenerative sagittal imbalance. Acute PJFs were categorized into 4 subtypes: fracture at uppermost instrumented vertebra (UIV), fracture at vertebra just proximal to UIV (UIV+1), fixation failure at UIV, and junctional subluxation. Demographic, clinical, and radiographic data were analyzed retrospectively.
   RESULTS: There were 18 patients with acute PJFs. PJF group had significantly lower T-score (-3.3 +/- 1.1 vs. -1.9 +/- 1.5) on bone densitometry and lower body mass index (BMI) (23.0 +/- 3.9 kg/m(2) vs. 25.6 +/- 3.7 kg/m(2)) than non-PJF group. Radiographic parameters exhibited no significant differences. UIV fracture, UIV+1 fracture, UIV fixation failure, and junctional subluxation were observed in 5, 6, 4, and 3 patients. Fixation failure developed the earliest (median 1.3 months), followed by UIV fracture (1.5 months). UIV fracture occurred earlier than UIV+1 fracture (36 months). Patients with UIV or UIV+1 fracture had significantly lower T-scores than others. Although BMI and T-score were significant risk factors for all PJFs (P = 0.043 and P = 0.021, respectively), different risk factors for each subtype of PJFs were identified on separate risk factor analysis.
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients with acute PJFs had lower T-score and BMI. Each subtype of PJFs had different clinical and radiographic features. Although BMI and T-score were associated with all PJFs, each subtype may have different risk factors. Identifying risk factors for each subtype of acute PJFs may help avoid it.

AB OBJECTIVE: Glioblastoma (GBM) is associated with increased risk of developing dural venous sinus thrombosis (DVST), which often goes undiagnosed as symptoms are readily attributed to tumor. The purpose of this study was to investigate the incidence of DVST, potential predictive features on imaging, complications, its effect on survival, and time of greatest risk for developing DVST.
   METHODS: A retrospective search of patients with GBM who had surgery followed by chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy between 2009 and 2015 at our institution was performed. Magnetic resonance imaging studies of the brain were reviewed on volumetric postgadolinium T1-weighted sequences for DVST. Tumors were characterized using the Visually Accessible REMBRANDT (Repository for Molecular Brain Neoplasia Data) Images classification, and identified thromboses were tracked for propagation, regression, or resolution. Statistical analyses were directed at identifying clinical predictors and survival differences between the DVST and no-DVST groups.
   RESULTS: In total, 163 cases totaling 1637 scans, were reviewed; 12 patients (7.4%) developed DVST, of whom 11 presented with thrombus before any treatment. Tumor invasion of dural sinuses and greater T1/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery ratios were significantly associated with thrombus development (P = 0.02 and P = 0.02, respectively). In patients who developed DVST, thrombosis was more likely to develop ipsilateral to tumor side (P = 0.01) and was associated with a greater likelihood of developing extracranial venous thromboembolism (P = 0.012). There were no venous infarcts and no significant difference in survival between groups (P = 0.83).
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients with GBM have increased risk of developing DVST, independent of surgical treatment or chemoradiation. DVST presence does not affect survival. Tumor invasion of dural sinuses and greater T1/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery ratio on preoperative imaging were the most significant predictors of DVST development.

AB OBJECTIVE: Previous research has shown a strong correlation between the Ki-67 proliferation index and grade of malignancy in astrocytoma. Ki-67 has also shown encouraging results as a prognostic marker for patients' overall survival (OS). We focus on whether the index is linked to the appearance of glioblastoma on pretreatment magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or to OS.
   METHODS: In our retrospective study, only isocitrate dehydrogenase IDH wild-type glioblastoma was included (n = 152). Ki-67 index was quantified via immunohistochemistry. On all pretreatment MRI, tumor compartments (tumor, necrosis, and edema) were volumetrically assessed. An OS subpopulation was filtered from the total cohort (residual tumor volume <= 2 cm(3)). In addition, a propensity score matching was executed.
   RESULTS: All volumetric assessed tumor volumes correlated with each other (P <= 0.011), although the Ki-67 index showed no correlation with any of the measured volumes. Concerning the OS, a cutoff value of 20% for the Ki-67 index showed a significant influence on patients' OS in multivariate analysis (P = 0.043).
   CONCLUSIONS: The unique appearance of every glioblastoma on MRI seems to be independent of the Ki-67 index. Furthermore, the Ki-67 index did show a distinct prognostic value for OS within our cohort at a cutoff value of 20% for Ki-67.

AB BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumor and has a high recurrence rate. Maximizing the extent of resection (EOR) in recurrent GBM has proved to be the cornerstone of neurosurgical retreatment. The development of surgical microscopes fitted with fluorescein-specific filters has facilitated fluorescein-guided microsurgery and the identification of tumor tissue. Use of fluorescein sodium (FL) in primary high-grade glioma resection has shown promising results. Here, we present our experience with FL and the dedicated surgical microscope filter YELLOW 560 nm in 106 patients with recurrent GBM.
   METHODS: A total of 106 patients with recurrent GBM were included (53 women, 53 men; mean age, 53 years). A total of 5 mg/kg bodyweight of FL was intravenously injected approximately 45 minutes before craniotomy. A YELLOW 560 nm filter (PENTERO 900 [Carl Zeiss Meditec, Oberkochen Germany]) was used for microsurgical tumor resection and resection control. Surgical reports were reviewed regarding the degree of fluorescent staining. Postoperative magnetic resonance images were examined within 48 hours after surgery regarding the EOR and postoperative course regarding neurologic outcome, complications, and any adverse events.
   RESULTS: Bright fluorescent staining was present in all patients, which markedly enhanced tumor visibility and was deemed helpful for tumor resection. Seventeen patients (16%) showed residual tumor tissue on postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Therefore, gross total resection was achieved in 89 patients (84%). No adverse events were registered postoperatively.
   CONCLUSIONS: FL and YELLOW 560 nm are readily available methods for fluorescence-guided tumor resection, similar to contrast enhancement in T1-weighted MRI. FL may improve resection in recurrent GBM with minimal risk, and tumor margins are clearly visualized. FL and the YELLOW 560 nm filter are safe and feasible tools for safe maximal resection of recurrent glioblastoma.

TI Double-Barrel Superficial Temporal Artery to Proximal Middle Cerebral
   Artery Bypass to Treat Complex Intracranial Aneurysms: A Reliable High
   Blood Flow Bypass
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY

AB BACKGROUND: The superficial temporal artery (STA) to proximal middle cerebral artery bypass has been reported before. However, the flow supply capacity of the double-barrel STA to proximal MCA bypass in treating complex intracranial aneurysms has not been well documented.
   METHODS: Consecutive cases using double-barrel STA to proximal MCA bypass to treat complex intracranial aneurysms during the past 5 years were collected. Somatosensory evoked potential monitoring and motor evoked potential monitoring were applied for each patient to identify any ischemic events during surgery. After bypass, the aneurysm was trapped, or the proximal parent artery was occluded. Digital subtraction angiography or computed tomography angiography was used to evaluate the patency of bypass postoperatively. Blood flow was measured by ultrasound before discharge.
   RESULTS: Among 1561 patients treated for intracranial aneurysms in our institute, 6 were included for the current report. There were 2 dominant M2 fusiform aneurysms, 2 M1 fusiform aneurysms, 1 supraclinoid internal carotid artery fusiform aneurysm, and 1 M1 bifurcation giant aneurysm. All 6 cases were successfully treated using this technique. One patient had temporary numbness in the contralateral extremities, which was caused by perforator complications. The blood flow carried by the STA was 108-232 mL/minute.
   CONCLUSIONS: When anastomosed to proximal branches, a double-barrel STA to MCA bypass can reliably provide a high blood flow of >100 mL/minute. Combined with aneurysm trapping or parent artery occlusion, this bypass algorithm could be an alternative treatment for complex intracranial aneurysms.

AB BACKGROUND: Few prognostic markers are available for patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) undergoing neurosurgical resection of symptomatic brain metastases.
   OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether tumor mutation status (EGFR, KRAS, ALK, ROS1, and BRAF) and treatment history were associated with survival after neurosurgery.
   METHODS: We reviewed the electronic health records of 104 patients with NSCLC with genomic profiling who underwent neurosurgical resection for symptomatic brain metastases at an academic institution between January 2000 and January 2018. We used multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models to evaluate the association between overall survival (OS) after neurosurgery and clinicopathologic factors, including mutation status.
   RESULTS: Mean age of patients in this study was 61 (+/- 12) years, and 44% were men. The median OS after neurosurgery was 24 months (95% confidence interval, 18-34 months). Our multivariate analysis showed that the presence of an EGFR mutation in the tumor was significantly associated with improved OS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.214; P = 0.029), independent of tyrosine kinase inhibitor use. Presence of KRAS, ALK, ROS1, and BRAF alterations was not associated with survival (all P > 0.05). Conversely, older age (HR, 1.039; P = 0.029), a history of multiple brain irradiation procedures ( HR, 9.197; P < 0.001), and presence of extracranial metastasis (HR, 2.556; P = 0.016) resulted in increased risk of mortality.
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients requiring surgical resection of an epidermal growth factor receptor-mutated NSCLC brain metastasis had an associated improved survival compared with patients without this mutation, independent of tyrosine kinase inhibitor use. Decreased survival was associated with older age, multiple previous brain radiation therapies, and extracranial metastasis.

AB BACKGROUND: Because the prognosis of high-grade aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH), classified as World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies (WFNS) grade IV-V, is generally poor, the functional outcomes of survivors have not been thoroughly explored. The aim of this retrospective cohort study is to determine predictors of functional independence in patients who survive a highgrade aSAH.
   METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated consecutive patients with aSAH admitted to a single institution from January 2000 to April 2015. Adult (age >= 18 years) patients with WFNS grade IV-V aSAH were included for analysis. Patients without sufficient baseline data, those who died before discharge, and those without follow-up data were excluded. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with functional independence, defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 0-2, at last follow-up.
   RESULTS: Of the 260 patients with a WFNS grade IV-V aSAH during the study period, 139 met the inclusion criteria. After a mean follow-up of 6.3 months, functional independence was achieved in 73% of high-grade aSAH survivors (101/139 patients) and in 39% of all high-grade aSAH cases (101/260 patients). Only a lack of cerebrospinal fluid shunt placement was found to be an independent predictor of functional independence in the multivariable analysis (odds ratio 0.28 [0.109-0.722]; P = 0.008).
   CONCLUSIONS: Because functional independence can be achieved in the majority of high-grade aSAH survivors, aggressive initial management of high-grade aSAH is warranted. Strategies that reduce the need for permanent cerebrospinal fluid diversion may improve functional outcomes in survivors of high-grade aSAH.

AB OBJECTIVE: Superior cluneal nerve entrapment neuropathy is one cause of low back pain often referred to as "pseudo sciatica." Studies have found that the superior cluneal nerve can arise variably from T11 to L5. The osteofibrous tunnels formed by a groove on the iliac crest might compress the superior cluneal nerve. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the origin of the superior cluneal nerve and its course through such bony grooves.
   METHODS: Twenty sides from 10 fresh frozen Caucasian cadavers were used in this study. Once both the superior cluneal nerve and its groove were identified, the distance from the groove to the posterior superior iliac spine and midline was measured.
   RESULTS: A total of 12 grooves were identified in 11 of 20 sides (55%). On 10 sides, the nerve running on the groove was the medial branch of the superior cluneal nerve. The mean distance from the bony groove to the posterior superior iliac spine and midline was 45.2 +/- 11.2 mm and 65.3 +/- 8.2 mm, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: These results could help identify such bony grooves and better understand low back pain and its related anatomy.

DT Article

   rhizotomy; Spastic diplegia
ID CEREBRAL-PALSY; CHILDREN; COMPLICATIONS
AB OBJECTIVES: Selective dorsal rhizotomy (SDR) is used to improve spasticity, gait, and pain in children with spastic diplegia. There is growing evidence supporting its longterm benefits in terms of functional outcomes, independence, and quality of life. There is, however, little contemporary work describing the surgical morbidity of this irreversible procedure. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the surgical outcomes and complications of SDR at a single United Kingdom center.
   METHODS: Demographics, surgical, postoperative, and follow-up data for all patients undergoing SDR between 2011 and 2016 were collected from medical records.
   RESULTS: Preoperative Gross Motor Function Classification System levels in 150 consecutive patients were II (35%), III (65%), and IV (1%). Median age was 6 years and 58% were male patients. There were no deaths, cerebrospinal fluid leaks, returns to theater, or readmissions within 30 days. There were no new motor or sphincter deficits. Postoperative neuropathic pain was reported by 5.3% and sensory symptoms by 8.7%. Other complications included: postoperative nausea and vomiting (19.3%), superficial wound infection (3.3%), urinary retention (1.3%), headache (6.7%), and urine or chest infection (4.7%). Follow-up data were available for all patients (93% to 12 months, 72% to 24 months). Persistent neuropathic symptoms were reported in 6.5% at 24 months.
   CONCLUSIONS: SDR using a single-level approach is a safe procedure with low surgical morbidity. This study complements the growing evidence base in support of SDR for spastic diplegia and should help inform decisions when considering treatment options.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between postoperative lumbar curve progression and the shoulder height in patients with Lenke type 2B/C adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS).
   METHODS: A total of 25 patients with Lenke type 2B/C AIS underwent posterior correction surgery in our institution from 2005-2014 were included. Standing x-ray films of the whole spine obtained before surgery, immediately after surgery, and at the last follow-up were analyzed with respect to the following parameters: proximal thoracic Cobb angle, main thoracic (MT) Cobb angle, lumbar Cobb angle, lumbar apical vertebral translation, distance between C7 plumb line and the central sacral vertical line, and radiographic shoulder height (RSH). Correlations between the change of RSH and the changes of other parameters were analyzed both immediately after surgery and at the last follow-up.
   RESULTS: The change of RSH was significantly negatively correlated with both the change of MT Cobb angle (P < 0.05) and that of lumbar Cobb angle (P < 0.05) immediately after surgery, whereas the interval-time change of RSH was significantly positively correlated with the interval-time change of lumbar Cobb angle (P < 0.05) and that of lumbar apical vertebral translation (P < 0.05) at the last follow-up. The change of MT Cobb angle was an independent predictor for the change of RSH immediately after surgery, whereas the interval-time change of lumbar Cobb angle was an independent predictor for the interval-time change of RSH at the last follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative lumbar curve progression is a risk factor for deterioration of shoulder imbalance in patients with Lenke 2B/C AIS during the follow-up period.

   VOLUME; MECHANISM
AB BACKGROUND: The relationship between superior cervical ganglia (SCG) ischemia due to bilateral common carotid artery ligation (BCCAL) and basilar artery (BA) reconfiguration was investigated.
   METHODS: Twenty-three rabbits were randomly divided into 3 groups: group III rabbits underwent BCCAL (n = 13), group II rabbits were sham-operated controls (n = 5), and group I rabbits did not undergo surgery (n = 5). Degenerated neuron densities (DND) within the SCG were correlated with the BA vasodilatation index (VDI).
   RESULTS: Mean live and DND in SCG of group I rabbits were 11.235 +/- 982/mu m(3) and 11 +/- 3/mu m(3), respectively, with a mean heart rate of 294 +/- 21 beats/min. Mean SCG DND and heart rates were 213 +/- 42/mu m(3) and 242 +/- 17 beats/min for the sham group (group II) rabbits and 1743 +/- 285/mu m(3) and 199 +/- 19 beats/min for the study group (group III) rabbits, respectively. The BA VDI values in the sham group (group II) (1.32 +/- 0.10) and the study group (group III) (0.976 +/- 0.112) significantly differed from those in the control group (group I) (1.65 +/- 0.12; P < 0.005) versus the sham group (group II) (P < 0.0001) versus the BCCAL applied group (group III) and between group II and group III (P < 0.005).
   CONCLUSIONS: A meaningful and paradoxic correlation was detected between the BA VDI values and degenerated neuron density of SCG after BCCAL. Although a low degenerated neuron density within SCG may provoke excessive sympathetic activity and prevent excessive BA dilatation with steno-occlusive carotid artery diseases, a high degenerated neuron density may cause dangerous vasodilatation of BA.

AB OBJECTIVE: Pediatric intracranial aneurysms (IAs) are rare and differ from their adult counterparts in terms of their aneurysmal characteristics, presentation, treatment, and outcomes. Their treatment is often more difficult and complex compared with that of adults. However, studies outlining the clinical effect of pediatric IAs remain sparse.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the data from patients aged <= 18 years admitted to our hospital from 2000 to 2017 with a diagnosis of IAs.
   RESULTS: From the sample of 8207 patients with an IA diagnosis, 26 patients with 33 IAs were involved. Our cohort included 17 males and 9 females, with a mean age of 12.5 years. The mean follow-up duration was 4 years and 3 months. Seven patients (26.92%) were assumed to have a traumatic origin for their IAs. Ruptured aneurysms were more common than unruptured ones (61.53% vs. 38.46%). Complex features were observed in 14 aneurysms (42.42%). Initially, microsurgical and endovascular treatment were both performed in 10 patients (38.46%). A good recovery was obtained in 16 patients (61.54%) as determined by the Glasgow outcome scale scores at the 6-month follow-up visits. The complete obliteration of aneurysms was observed in 17 patients (65.38%). Endovascular treatment was the initial treatment in 3 patients with incomplete obliteration.
   CONCLUSIONS: The treatment of pediatric IAs is challenging and technically demanding owing to their discrete nature compared with adult IAs and the need for greater surgical skills. We found a male predominance, with internal carotid artery bifurcation as the most frequent location of the aneurysms. Despite the greater incidence of ruptured and complex aneurysm cases, many patients had experienced a good recovery at the 6-month follow-up examinations.

AB OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate neck movement and various conditions of the aortic arch that may hinder access to the carotid artery during neurointerventional procedures.
   METHODS: We reviewed 230 patients who underwent internal carotid artery angiography between February 2016 and October 2016. Use of a Davis catheter (DC) was first attempted and if not possible, movement (right, left, flexion, and extension) of the patient's head was tried before catheter exchange. We analyzed the success rate after neck motion in relation to various aortic arch factors.
   RESULTS: Only extension of the patient's neck was effective. Of the 209 patients with right side angiography, 23 had failed access with a DC, but neck extension was effective in 3 patients (13%). Failure to insert a DC was significantly correlated with age, male sex, acute angle, arch elongation, aortic calcification, and carotid artery angulation on the right side, whereas access was not gained in 24 out of 208 patients who underwent left side angiography, and neck extension was successful in 7 patients (29.2%). Also, significant factors determining the catheter exchangewere age, male sex, acute angle, arch elongation, and aortic calcification. In the DC access failure group, neck extension was significantly more effective for younger aged patients (P = 0.011).
   CONCLUSIONS: Factors such as older age, acute arch angle, higher elongation type, arch calcification, and carotid artery angulation were verified as factors affecting access by a simple catheter; however, neck extension was shown to facilitate access in about 10%-30% of patents.

AB BACKGROUND: The number of endovascular treatment procedures performed for cerebral aneurysms has markedly increased. However, little is known about the annual effective radiation dose to medical staff in neuro-intervention fields. We performed a retrospective observational study to investigate the real-time radiation dose to surgeons, nurses, anesthesiologists, and radiologic technologists during endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms.
   METHODS: We measured the real-time radiation doses for 2 weeks using standard and reinforced protection, during which 28 procedures were performed, including 23 coil embolizations for unruptured intracranial aneurysms. Four procedures were excluded because of an inadequately equipped sensor, which resulted in inappropriate data collection. The procedure time was defined from intubation to extubation. Five RaySafe i2 detectors were installed at the chest level of the operator, attending nurse, radiologic technologist, and anesthesiologist and just inside the front door of the hybrid operating room.
   RESULTS: The median doses per session with standard protection to the operator, attending nurse, anesthesiologist, and radiologic technologist were 11.16, 2.60, 4.76, and 1.93 mu Sv, respectively. The dose to the operator, attending nurse, and anesthesiologist had decreased to 6.63, 0.39, and 1.52 mu Sv under reinforced protection, respectively. However, the session dose for the radiologic technologist had increased to 3.12 mu Sv.
   CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed the differences in the amount of radiation exposure for different roles. An additional lead screen, which provided more effective protection on the operator side, was proved effective for attenuating radiation exposure during endovascular treatment. All personnel involved in the hybrid operating room were exposed to acceptable effective doses.

AB INTRODUCTION: The primary treatment for patients with sacral chordoma is en bloc surgical resection with negative margins, which has been shown to reduce local recurrence and tumor-related morbidity. Here we describe the use of intraoperative neuronavigation using preoperative spine magnetic resonance imaging fused to intraoperative computed tomography (CT) to create 3-dimensional tumor reconstructions in the operating room for intraoperative identification of bone and soft-tissue margins for maximal safe tumor resection.
   METHODS: A single-institution retrospective chart review was completed to encompass our experience of 6 consecutive patients who had sacral chordoma resections using our described navigation protocol. We collected data on patient demographics, previous surgeries, radiation therapy, preoperative examination, spinal levels involved, dural involvement, estimated blood loss, surgery time, tissue diagnosis, follow-up, postoperative examination, complications, and recurrence. Primary outcome was en bloc resection with negative margins as planned preoperatively.
   RESULTS: Negative surgical margins were achieved in 5 of 5 patients, who were preoperatively planned for en bloc resection with negative margins. The most common levels involved were S4-S5. All patients had a stable or improved neurologic examination after en bloc surgical resection. The average follow-up was 5.4 months +/- 84.6 days. No patient had residual or recurrent tumor at last follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: Magnetic resonance imaging-CT fusion and 3-dimensional reconstruction techniques using an intraoperative CT scanner with image-guided navigation to aid preoperative planning and surgical resection of sacral chordomas are not well represented in the literature. This technique can be used for planning en bloc surgical resections and for more precisely identifying tumor margins intraoperatively.

AB BACKGROUND: Evaluation of plaque protrusion after carotid artery stenting (CAS) is important for predicting periprocedural ischemic complications. In contrast to intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), angioscopy allows direct visualization of the plaque. The aim of this study was to evaluate utility and safety of angioscopy during CAS and compare it with IVUS.
   METHODS: The study included 13 carotid artery stenosis lesions in 11 consecutive patients (mean age 70.5 years; 10 men) at a single center. During CAS procedure, poststenting plaque protrusion was evaluated with angioscopy and IVUS.
   RESULTS: Mean level of internal carotid artery stenosis was 79.2%. Eight lesions were symptomatic, and 5 lesions were predicted to have vulnerable plaque by preprocedural magnetic resonance imaging. A carotid WALLSTENT was placed in all cases. After stenting, angioscopy provided good visualization in all cases. Plaque protrusions were observed in 1 case by IVUS and in 8 cases by angioscopy. Diffusion-weighted imaging showed positive lesions in 3 cases (23%). For 2 of these lesions, plaque protrusions were observed by angioscopy but not by IVUS. All lesions associated with positive diffusion-weighted imaging findings were observed to have yellow plaque on angioscopy.
   CONCLUSIONS: Angioscopy provided direct visualization of stent lumens after CAS. Angioscopy detected more plaque protrusion than IVUS and allowed clearer observation of plaque characteristics. Angioscopy may be more useful than IVUS for examination of plaque protrusion and plaque evaluation after CAS, especially for plaque identified as potentially vulnerable by preprocedural examination.

AB BACKGROUND: Arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be used to determine brain regions at risk for ischemia in patients with moyamoya vasculopathy and to identify patients who may benefit from surgical revascularization. We aimed to investigate whether 1) the severity of moyamoya is related to the presence of leptomeningeal collaterals and cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR), 2) the presence of collaterals and ivy sign reflects disturbed CVR, and 3) arterial transit artefacts (ATAs) and ivy sign reflect the presence of collaterals.
   METHODS: We determined severity of moyamoya on digital subtraction angiography (DSA) according to the modified Suzuki classification in 20 brain regions and scored regional tissue revascularization using a 4-point scale. Regional CVR and ATAs were assessed on ASL perfusion MRI, ivy sign on fluid attenuation inversion recovery MRI.
   RESULTS: In 11 patients (median age 36 years; 91% female), we studied 203 regions. ATAs were associated with the presence of collaterals on DSA (P < 0.01). Of all regions with clearly visible collateral vessels on DSA, however, only 24% had ATAs. Ivy sign was not related to the presence or absence of collaterals nor to CVR. In 10% of regions with good vascularization on DSA, CVR was poor showed steal.
   CONCLUSIONS: ATAs were associated with the presence of collaterals on DSA. Although DSA vascularization scores correlated with CVR, 10% of regions with good vascularization on DSA had absent CVR or steal on ASL-MRI. DSA and ivy sign did not provide adequate information on the hemodynamic status of brain tissue in patients with moyamoya vasculopathy.

AB OBJECTIVE: The minimally invasive microvascular decompression (MVD) for trigeminal neuralgia is technically a more challenging operation compared with the standard retrosigmoidal approach. Endoscopic assistance could help to widen the field of view of the microscope during MVD. An extended view around the cisternal segment of the trigeminal nerve can be achieved only with the targeted dissection of the arachnoid membranes. The goal of our study was to analyze the three-dimensional organization of these membranes around the trigeminal nerve.
   METHODS: Microsurgical, endoscopic, and macroscopic anatomic examinations were performed on 50 fresh human cadaveric specimens. Retrospective analysis of the video documentations of 50 MVDs was performed to describe the surgical relevance of the examined membranes.
   RESULTS: The trigeminal nerve is surrounded circumferentially by 4 inner arachnoid membranes: laterally and caudally by the trigeminal membrane (TM), cranially by the superior cerebellar membrane (SCM), and medially by the junction between the cranial edge of the anterior pontine membrane and the lateral edge mesencephalic leaf of the Liliequist membrane complex. The superior cerebellar artery was located in every case cranial from the SCM. This membrane served as a safety plane to dissect the vessel from the nerve. The SCM was laterally adherent to the TM, which made the arachnoid dissection challenging. The superior petrosal vein was located cranially and laterally from the described inner arachnoid membranes, but the transverse pontine vein was embedded into the membrane complex.
   CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge of the described anatomy of the arachnoid membranes around the trigeminal nerve is essential to safely perform an MVD.

AB BACKGROUND: Primary intracranial squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a rare neoplasm associated with malignant transformation of benign epidermoid or dermoid cysts. The optimal treatment and prognosis of this rare disease are unclear.
   METHODS: A comprehensive literature review identified all reports relevant to clinical presentation, treatment, and outcome of primary intracranial SCC. All available data were extracted from the included literature. Two patients diagnosed with malignant transformation of an epidermoid cyst in our institutewere also included in the study. Survival analysiswas conducted to determine the factors affecting patient outcomes.
   RESULTS: A total of 62 cases were identified and selected for the present study. The median survival regardless of treatment was 12.8 months. Median survival for patients treated with surgery alone and surgery with radiotherapy was 5 months and 35 months, respectively (P = 0.037). Patients who underwent gross total resection showed relatively increased survival compared with those who underwent subtotal resection (median, 48 months vs. 25 months; P = 0.067). Patients with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis had a significantly decreased median survival of 10 months, as opposed to 41 months (P = 0.005).
   CONCLUSIONS: Primary intracranial SCC shows poor prognosis, with controversial management. The results of this study indicate that complete resection of tumor when possible, followed by radiotherapy, is the optimal treatment for improving patient outcome.

AB OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate the incidence of cardiac abnormalities in patients with idiopathic scoliosis and identify risk factors related to cardiac abnormalities.
   METHODS: A cohort of 531 patients with idiopathic scoliosis requiring surgical treatment in our hospital from March 2009 to August 2017 were recorded. Clinical data including medical records, radiograph, and echocardiogram were collected. All patients were divided into groups: control, congenital heart disease (CHD), and other cardiac abnormalities (OCAs). The incidence and related factors for cardiac abnormalities were analyzed.
   RESULTS: The age of the study cohort was 17.8 +/- 7.3 years. The average Cobb angle was 57.7 +/- 16.5 degrees. Cardiac abnormalities were found in 149 (28.06%) patients, including 22 (4.14%) with CHD and 127 (23.92%) with OCAs. Atrial septal defect was the most common CHD with an incidence of 1.13% (6 of 531). Mitral valve prolapse was detected in 62 (11.68%) patients, which was the most prevalent OCA. Patients with CHD or OCAs weighed less as compared with patients without cardiac abnormalities. Low height was associated with CHD in patients with idiopathic scoliosis. Six patients with severe cardiac abnormalities must undergo cardiac intervention before scoliosis surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: The overall incidence of cardiac abnormalities was 28.81% in patients with idiopathic scoliosis. An echocardiogram may be helpful as a preoperative examination for patients with idiopathic scoliosis before scoliosis surgery.

AB OBJECTIVE: To assess the sensitivity and specificity of arteriovenous malformation (AVM) nidal component identification and quantification using an unsupervised machine learning algorithm and to evaluate the association between intervening nidal brain parenchyma and radiationinduced changes (RICs) after stereotactic radiosurgery.
   METHODS: Fully automated segmentation via unsupervised classification with fuzzy c-means clustering was used to analyze the AVM nidus on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging studies. The proportions of vasculature, brain parenchyma, and cerebrospinal fluid were quantified. These were compared with the results from manual segmentation. The association between the brain parenchyma component and RIC development was assessed.
   RESULTS: The proposed algorithm was applied to 39 unruptured AVMs in 39 patients (17 female and 22 male patients), with a median age of 27 years. The median proportion of the constituents was as follows: vasculature, 31.3%; brain parenchyma, 48.4%; and cerebrospinal fluid, 16.8%. RICs were identified in 17 of the 39 patients (43.6%). Compared with manual segmentation, the automated algorithm was able to achieve a Dice similarity index of 79.5% (sensitivity, 73.5%; specificity, 85.5%). RICs were associated with a greater proportion of intervening nidal brain parenchyma (52.0% vs. 45.3%; P = 0.015). Obliteration was not associated with greater proportions of nidal vasculature (36.0% vs. 31.2%; P = 0.152).
   CONCLUSIONS: The automated segmentation algorithm was able to achieve classification of the AVM nidus components with relative accuracy. Greater proportions of intervening nidal brain parenchyma were associated with RICs.

AB OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to analyze the risk factors for secondary new vertebral compression fractures (SNVCFs) after percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures.
   METHODS: We evaluated the association of SNVCFs (adjacent vertebral compression fractures [AVCFs] and remote vertebral compression fractures) with clinical, radiographic, and PVP procedure-related morphologic parameters based on the data collected from 402 patients over a minimum follow-up of 4 years after PVP. Procedure-related morphologic parameters were assessed using a three-dimensional voxel-based analysis. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were conducted.
   RESULTS: On univariate analysis, bone mineral density (BMD), preoperative compression ratio, preoperative sagittal index (SI), and intradiscal bone cement leakage were significantly associated with SNVCF and AVCF (P < 0.05), whereas only BMD and preoperative SI were significantly associated with remote vertebral compression fracture (P < 0.05). A large ratio of bone cement volume to vertebral body volume and skewed bone cement distribution along the inferior-to-superior axis were especially significant risk factors for AVCF (P = 0.027 and P = 0.029, respectively). On multivariate analysis, BMD was significantly associated with SNVCF (P = 0.041), whereas upper adjacent intradiscal bone cement leakage was significantly associated with AVCF (P = 0.003).
   CONCLUSIONS: Low BMD, high preoperative compression ratio, and high preoperative SI may be predictive factors for SNVCFs. In particular, to prevent AVCF, the injected bone cement should be distributed both evenly and symmetrically along the inferior-to-superior axis and the relative bone cement volume should not be excessive. Bone cement should be injected carefully to avoid upper adjacent intradiscal leakage. Prompt BMD correction is important to prevent SNVCF.

AB OBJECTIVE: Although microvascular decompression (MVD) is the primary treatment for hemifacial spasm (HFS), the postoperative course is variable. This study aimed to develop a prediction model of the outcome of MVD in patients with HFS by investigating influential factors.
   METHODS: Electronic medical records of 1624 patients with HFS who underwent MVD from July 2004 to January 2015 were reviewed. The relationships between patient-related, disease-related, and surgery-related factors and postoperative outcome were analyzed using multinomial logistic regression. A predictive model for MVD outcome was developed using decision tree analysis.
   RESULTS: The mean follow-up duration after surgery was 30.2 months (median, 23.5 months; range, 6.0-133.3 months). For the 1624 patients, the overall improvement rate was 90.5%. Overall, 984 patients (60.6%) showed improvement of spasm immediately after surgery, 486 (29.9%) experienced delayed improvement, and 154 (9.5%) showed persistence of spasm. Outcome of patients with HFS after MVD was predicted by 4 items: postoperative delayed facial palsy, degree of preoperative spasm, intraoperative indentation on the facial nerve, and sex. The patients were classified into 6 categories and improvement of spasm immediately after surgery showed 35%-91%, delayed improvement 6%-46%, and persistence of spasm 0%-59%. The accuracy of the developed prediction model was 0.608.
   CONCLUSIONS: Male sex, mild degree of preoperative spasm, intraoperative indentation on the facial nerve, and postoperative delayed facial palsy were better favorable prognostic factors of MVD in patients with HFS. This novel algorithm may be useful to predict the outcome of MVD in these patients.

AB OBJECTIVE: Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) mutation status is an independent favorable prognostic factor for glioblastoma (GBM) and is usually determined by sequencing or immunohistochemistry. An accurate prediction of IDH1 mutation status via noninvasive methods helps establish the appropriate treatment strategy. We aimed to predict IDH1 mutation status using quantitative radiomic data in patients with GBM.
   METHODS: Between May 2010 and June 2015, we retrospectively identified 88 patients with newly diagnosed GBM. After semiautomatic segmentation of the lesions, we extracted 31 features from preoperative multiparametric magnetic resonance images. We also determined IDH1 mutation status using targeted sequencing and immunohistochemistry. A training cohort (n = 88) was used to train machine learning-based classifiers, with internal validation. The machine-learning technique was then validated in an external dataset of 35 patients with GBM.
   RESULTS: We detected the IDH1 mutation in 12 out of 88 GBMs. Multiparametric radiomic profiles revealed that the IDH1 mutation was associated with a smaller enhancing area volume and a larger necrotic area volume. Using the machine learning-based classification algorithms, we identified 70.3%-87.3% of prediction rate of IDH1 mutation status and found 66.3%-83.4% accuracy in the external validation set.
   CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that machine learning algorithms can predict IDH1 mutation status in GBM using preoperative multiparametric magnetic resonance images.

   DISEASE
AB BACKGROUND: The cause of postoperative heterotopic ossification (HO) after cervical disc replacement (CDR) is unclear. The aim of the present study was to investigate the incidence of HO, its clinical significance, and whether the degree of preoperative degeneration was associated with its occurrence.
   METHODS: Patients who had undergone CDR using the Prestige-LP disc with a minimum of 48 months of follow-up were included. The patients were divided into 2 groups stratified by the presence of HO. The clinical outcomes (visual analog scale for neck and arm pain, neck disability index, and Japanese Orthopaedic Association scores) and radiographic parameters were collected and analyzed pre- and postoperatively and compared between the 2 groups. The preoperative degeneration at the operated levels was evaluated using the Kellgren-Lawrence scale and Miyazaki magnetic resonance imaging grading system.
   RESULTS: A total of 69 patients (89 levels) were identified, and the average age at surgery was 45.8 years. The overall incidence of HO at the final follow-up visit was 37.7% (26 of 69 of patients), and an increasing incidence and severity of HO was observed during the follow-up period. Significant and maintained improvements for all clinical outcome measures were observed, and the presence of HO did not influence these improvements. Segments with greater severe preoperative degeneration had a greater incidence of HO (P < 0.01). However, no statistical significant correlation between the degree of preoperative degeneration and the grade of HO was observed.
   CONCLUSION: The presence of HO after CDR was a relatively frequent finding at the final follow-up visit but did not influence patients' improvements. Segments with higher grades of preoperative degeneration had a greater incidence of HO; thus, HO is likely a reflection of the degeneration process.

AB BACKGROUND: Cavernous sinus hemangiomas (CSHs) are rare vascular tumors. Stereotactic radiosurgery is an effective treatment for small CSHs. The optimal treatment for giant CSHs is controversial. This study reports advantages of a complete intradural transcavernous approach in total resection of CSHs.
   METHODS: Between January 2012 and January 2017, 15 patients with giant CSHs were treated surgically. All cases were evaluated with a contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging scan and confirmed histopathologically. A complete intradural approach was used for all patients. Clinical manifestations, radiographic characteristics, operative techniques, and outcomes of patients were analyzed.
   RESULTS: Headache was the most common initial symptom, followed by decreased visual acuity and diplopia. Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging showed that gross total resection was achieved in 13 patients. Two patients had experienced total ipsilateral visual loss for several years before surgery; vision improved in all remaining patients with preoperative visual diminution. The most common early neurologic deficit was cranial nerve VI dysfunction, which was observed in 9 patients (60%; 5 new deficits). Only 2 patients (13.3%) experienced permanent morbidity on long-term follow-up. The early postoperative morbidity rate for cranial nerve III dysfunction was 33.3% (5 patients), and only 1 patient (6.7%) experienced permanent morbidity. Four patients (26.7%) had slight postoperative facial numbness.
   CONCLUSIONS: Surgical total resection is the primary and reasonable choice for giant CSHs. Microsurgical resection of giant CSHs through a completely intradural transcavernous approach is an alternative treatment option for giant CSHs.

AB BACKGROUND: Previous studies of percutaneous endoscopic lumbar discectomy (PELD) to treat lumbar disc herniation (LDH) have shown good clinical results. However, limited information has been reported regarding postoperative improvement in back muscle function. We aimed to determine whether changes in neuromuscular patterns, assessed using the flexion-relaxation phenomenon (FRP), could be observed after PELD.
   METHODS: A total of 30 patients participated in the present study. The patients' muscle functions were evaluated before and after PELD using surface electromyography and self-report measures. The evaluated action included 3 repetitions of a trunk flexion and extension movement. The association between the FRP measures and patient-reported outcomes was evaluated.
   RESULTS: At 4 weeks after PELD, the patients had significantly lower visual analog scale and Quebec Back Pain Disability Scale (QBPDS) scores and significantly increased gross range of motion. Also, we observed a reduction in erector spinae muscle activation at L3 in the maximum voluntary flexion phase. Normalized electromyographic root-mean-square values were significantly reduced in the maximum voluntary flexion phase and significantly increased in the extension phase. Postoperatively, 60% of the patients successfully achieved flexion-relaxation compared with 7% of the patients preoperatively. A significant correlation was found between the FRP measures and patient-reported outcomes, except for the Fear-Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire scale.
   CONCLUSION: PELD for individuals with LDH appears to normalize paraspinal muscle activation during lumbar flexion-extension movement. The gross range of motion and disability-related limitations of physical activity also improved.

AB OBJECTIVE: To explore the predictors of periprocedural complications and angiographic outcomes in large and giant intracranial posterior circulation aneurysms after endovascular treatment.
   METHODS: Data from 99 patients with 103 large (>= 10 mm; n = 94) and giant (>25 mm; n = 9) posterior circulation aneurysms treated with endovascular therapy at a single center were retrospectively analyzed. The treatment procedures included endovascular trapping (n = 15), coiling (n = 6), stent only (n = 10), stent-assisted coiling (n = 48), and pipeline embolization device (PED; n = 24). The outcome endpoints were the number of periprocedural complications and number of complete occlusions without any complication.
   RESULTS: Multivariate analysis revealed that intradural vertebral aneurysms (P = 0.041) and aneurysms <= 25 mm (P = 0.042) were associated with low periprocedural complication rates after endovascular therapy. Aneurysms not involving side branches (P = 0.024) and intradural vertebral aneurysms (P = 0.032) were predictors of complete aneurysm obliteration. No statistically significant differences were found in aneurysmal complete obliteration (P = 0.119) or periprocedural complications (P = 0.248) between a PED and traditional stent and coiling. Additionally, aneurysms not involving side branches (P = 0.030), intradural vertebral artery aneurysms (P = 0.003), and aneurysms treated with a PED (P = 0.020) were more likely to achieve complete occlusion over time.
   CONCLUSIONS: Aneurysm location, aneurysm size, and side branch involvement were predictors of periprocedural complications and angiographic outcomes of endovascular therapy for large and giant intracranial posterior circulation aneurysms. PED use provided no advantages compared with traditional stent and coiling in aneurysmal occlusion rates and periprocedural complications. Large case-control and long-term follow-up studies are needed to further explore the predictors of complications and angiographic outcomes and optimal treatment options for these aneurysms.

ID PLACEMENT
AB OBJECTIVE: To observe anatomic relationships between lumbar bicortical pedicle screws (BPSs) at 2 sagittal section angles (SSAs) and lumbar artery (LA).
   METHODS: We observed 2 SSAs, vertical angle and cephalic angle, of the BPS. The positions at which the BPS breaks through the anterior vertebral cortex were defined as point A and point B. Distances from point A and point B to LAs were measured. The percentage of risk of injury to LAs was calculated according to these distances.
   RESULTS: At the same transverse section angle on the left and right side in L1 and L2, distance from point A to LA was significantly greater than distance from point B to LA (P < 0.001) except at a transverse section angle of 0 degrees on the right side in L2 (P > 0.05). At the same transverse section angle on the left in L3 and L4, distance from point B to LA was significantly greater than distance from point A to LA (P < 0.001). The percentages of high risk of injury to the LA resulting from BPSs at the vertical angle in L1 and L2were 0% -6.2%. The percentages of high risk of injury to the LA resulting from BPSs at the cephalic angle on the left side in L3 and L4 were 0% -18.5%.
   CONCLUSIONS: Lumbar BPSs present a risk of injury to the LA. The vertical angle is the recommended SSA for BPSs in L1 and L2, and the cephalic angle is the recommended SSA in L3 and L4.

AB OBJECTIVE: We report a retrospective analysis of hardware failure in patients requiring instrumentation for spinal metastasis.
   METHODS: In a retrospective study at a single institution, we identified 58 patients who underwent spinal instrumentation for metastasis from 2012 to 2018. Hardware failure was defined as screw pullout/loosening, cage migration, progressive kyphosis, or an otherwise-noticeable instrumentation deficit detectable on imaging. Risk factors for hardware failure with a P < 0.05 in in univariate were included in multivariate logistic regression models controlled for age, sex, and previously identified risk factors for hardware failure.
   RESULTS: In total, 58 patients required instrumentation for metastatic spine disease. Median age was 60.2 years (interquartile range 49.0-66.3), 38 patients (65.5%) were male, and median follow-up was 8.1 months (interquartile range 3.1-20.7). Eight patients (13.8%) developed signs of hardware failure during follow-up, of whom 2 patients (3.4%) underwent operative revision. In univariate analysis, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status >2 (P = 0.049) and multiple myeloma lesions (P = 0.010) were significant predictors of failure. Both factors maintained significance in a multivariate logistic regression model controlled for age, sex, history of spine radiation, and number of fused levels with P = 0.047; odds ratio 12.7 (95% confidence interval 1.03-156.4) for Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status over 2 and P = 0.012; odds ratio 31.5 (95% confidence interval 2.2-460.0) for multiple myeloma lesions.
   CONCLUSIONS: The rate of hardware failure in this cohort was 13.8%, although operative revision rate was 3.4%. Spinal instrumentation in patients with poor preoperative functional status or multiple myeloma may be more likely to develop instrumentation failure.

AB OBJECTIVE: To perform a radiological analysis of the degeneration of C1-C2 joints after C1-C2 transarticular fixation (TAF) and compare the long-term results of a routine Magerl technique (RMT) to a posterior transarticular C1-C2 stand-alone screw instrumentation (SAS) application.
   METHODS: A total of 40 patients (26 men and 14 women) were included in the present retrospective observational cohort study. The mean follow-up period was 61.7 months (range, 11-118). The mean patient age at the baseline examination was 48.4 years (range, 22-82). Of the 40 patients, 11 were included in the RMT group and 29 in the SAS group.
   RESULTS: The structure of 80 atlantoaxial joints was analyzed, with grade 4 degenerative changes observed in 57 joints (71.3%). Of the 40 analyzed atlanto-odontoid joints, grade 4 degenerative changes were revealed in 18 joints (45%). C1-C2 bone fusion was observed in 38 patients (95%) and stable fibrous fusion in 2 patients (5%). No cases of C1-C2 nonunion were revealed. No statistically significant differences in the frequency of C1-C2 fracture consolidation or C1-C2 fusion were revealed between the RMT and SAS groups.
   CONCLUSIONS: The application of cortical lag screws in TAF might result in stable atlantoaxial joint fusion formation without joint curettage. Atlanto-odontoid joint fusion was also observed after C1-C2 TAF. The application of cortical lag screws for bilateral fixation using the SAS technique resulted in C1-C2 fusion in 93.1% of cases, comparable to the results with the Magerl technique.

AB OBJECTIVE: We sought to clarify the expression characteristics and prognostic significance of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 3 in cranial meningiomas.
   METHODS: We analyzed the expression of TGF-beta 3 at the mRNA level in 38 frozen meningioma samples. Clinical data collection, follow-up, correlations, and survival analyses were performed.
   RESULTS: World Health Organization (WHO) grade I meningiomas showed an average expression level of 2.55, which was higher than that of WHO grade II (average of 1.50) and WHO grade III (average of 0.21) (Kruskal-Wallis test, P = 0.008). For meningiomas with a history of surgery, the mean TGF-beta 3 expression level was 0.71, much lower than that of primary meningiomas with a mean value of 2.55 (Mann-Whitney U-test, P = 0.008). According to the Kaplan-Meier analysis and univariate Cox analysis, WHO grade (P = 0.001), history of surgery (P < 0.001), tumor volume (P = 0.045), preoperative Karnofsky Performance Status (P = 0.001), peritumoral brain edema (P = 0.039), postoperative radiotherapy (P = 0.001), degree of resection (P = 0.039), and TGF-beta 3 expression (P = 0.038) were prognostic factors for tumor recurrence. In addition, WHO grade (P < 0.001), history of surgery (P < 0.001), preoperative Karnofsky Performance Status (P = 0.002), peritumoral brain edema (P = 0.006), postoperative radiotherapy (P = 0.007), bone invasion (P = 0.03), and TGF-beta 3 expression (P = 0.041) were prognostic factors for mortality.
   CONCLUSIONS: TGF-beta 3 expression levels gradually declined with the increase of WHO grade and were lower in recurrent meningiomas than in primary meningiomas. Besides, low TGF-beta 3 expression was found to predict tumor recurrence and mortality in meningiomas based on univariate analysis.

AB OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the sensitivity and specificity of using the spinal midline (M line) on a radiographic anteroposterior (AP) view for detecting pedicle screws (PSs) breaching the medial pedicle wall.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 145 patients who underwent fusion surgery using PSs between January 2006 and May 2017. We defined the M line as a line that connected the upper and lower spinous processes through the fixed vertebrae. The M line was positive if the tip of the PS crossed the M line. The reference standard was a computed tomography scan. The reliability of the M line was examined.
   RESULTS: The subjects included 145 patients (70 men and 75 women; mean age, 63.4 years). A total of 599 PSs were examined. Most cases were because of spondylolisthesis (66.9%). Most screws were inserted at a lower lumber level (77.6%). Analysis of the diagnostic accuracy of the M line yielded a sensitivity of 74.1% and a specificity of 95.3%. In addition, the positive predictive value of the M line was 42.6%, and the negative predictive value of the M line was 98.7%.
   CONCLUSIONS: Assessment of the M line via an intra-operative radiographic AP view is a simple, readily available, complementary method for detecting PSs that have breached the medial pedicle wall in the thoracic, lumbar, and sacral spine. In particular, the M line has a strong negative predictive value, which is much more meaningful.

AB OBJECTIVE: Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is both relatively safe and reversible. Although SCS is generally regarded as a last resort, some of these patients will undergo additional spinal surgery after the device has been implanted or after its removal. We present a descriptive study of subsequent spinal surgery after SCS implantation.
   METHODS: A retrospective review of patients who had undergone percutaneous or paddle SCS lead placement at our institution from 2009 to 2016 was performed. Patients who had only undergone trials or who had not undergone spine surgery after SCS implantation were excluded.
   RESULTS: We identified 22 patients (5.7%) who had undergone spine surgery during the course of SCS treatment or after SCS removal, or both, of a total 383 patients who had undergone paddle and/or percutaneous SCS implantation. The most common additional spine interventions included lumbosacral decompression and fusion (n = 15; 42%). Of 36 surgeries, the most frequent indications for subsequent intervention were stenosis or restenosis (n = 16; 73%) and spine deformity (n = 6; 27%). The median EuroQol-5D index was 0.397 preoperatively and 0.678 postoperatively.
   CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to describe spine surgery in the setting of SCS implantation. Our results have indicated that spine surgery subsequent to, or concurrent with, SCS implantation appears to occur in few patients. Our study results suggest a modest improvement in quality of life outcomes. Therefore, clinicians should remember that patients might require further spine surgery despite the use of SCS implantation and, thus, might require reevaluation by the spine team.

AB OBJECTIVE: Sylvian subpial hematoma (SSH) is occasionally observed in aneurysm subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) when accompanied with the thick clot in the inferior limiting sulcus (ILS). We aimed to determine whether the thickness of the clot in the ILS (TCILS) was an indicator of SSH.
   METHODS: Data from 150 consecutive patients with aSAH were retrospectively analyzed. The relationship between TCILS on axial computed tomography (CT) image and intraoperatively confirmed SSH was reviewed. In patients without SSH, the average of the clot thickness in the bilateral ILS was used. The primary outcome was SSH.
   RESULTS: The median TCILS of the SSH group (n = 18, 12%) was larger than that of the non-SSH group (n = 132, 88%) (21 vs. 2.1 mm, respectively; P < 0.001). The intraclass correlation coefficients for clot thickness in the right and left ILS between 2 observers were 0.97 (P < 0.001) and 0.85 (P < 0.001). The TCILS threshold of >= 6.0 mm was associated with SSH, with a sensitivity of 89% and specificity of 99%. The unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios of the SSH of clot thickness in the affected ILS >= 6 mm relative to clot thickness in the affected ILS <6 mm were 263 (95% confidence interval [CI], 46-5063) and 137 (95% CI, 19-3029), respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: The clot thickness in the ILS on CT image was easily measured and could be a marker of SSH. SSH assessment could be useful in helping us predict the clinical course in patients with aSAH.

AB OBJECTIVE: The intraforaminal component of jugular foramen tumors is difficult to access surgically, as it requires complex approaches for radical removal and leads to a high recurrence due to residual tumor. The retrosigmoid suprajugular approach, intradural drilling of the roof of the jugular foramen, has been recently proposed for removal of such intraforaminal component without sacrificing the sigmoid-jugular venous system or requiring additional approaches. This study presents our experience with this approach and introduces the use of intraoperative continuous vagus nerve monitoring.
   METHODS: Nineteen patients (14 with neuromas and 5 with meningiomas) were operated using this approach over a 12.5-year period. In the more recent 14 cases, continuous vagus nerve monitoring was performed with a ball-type electrode placed on the proximal vagus nerve.
   RESULTS: More than 95% of the tumor removal was achieved in all but the first neuroma case. Extubation immediately after surgery and oral feeding within a week postoperatively was achieved in all patients. Seven of 9 patients with preoperative hearing disturbance symptomatically improved after surgery. All but the first case had no signs of recurrence during the follow-up period (average of 58 months).
   CONCLUSIONS: The retrosigmoid suprajugular approach is safe and effective for removal of tumors extending into the jugular foramen, maintaining a chance of hearing improvement. Intraoperative continuous vagus nerve monitoring is useful to avoid postoperative complications in such surgeries.

AB BACKGROUND: To study improvements in outcomes after surgery for intracranial meningiomas.
   METHODS: We performed a longitudinal observational study comparing 1469 patients operated on for intracranial meningioma in 4 consecutive time frames (1990-1994, 1995-1999, 2000-2004, and 2005-2010).
   RESULTS: Median age at surgery was 58.3 years. Median follow-up was 7 years. Patients in later periods were older than in the earlier ones (odds ratio [OR], 1.19 [1.09-1.32]; P < 0.0005), indicating a trend toward operating on more elderly patients. Before 2000, 42%, 32%, 6%, 19%, and 0.3% achieved Simpson grade (SG) I, II, III, IV, and V, respectively, whereas the SG rates were 35%, 37%, 4%, 23%, and 0.9% after 2000 (OR, 1.18 [1.06-1.30]; P < 0.005). The perioperative mortality (OR, 0.65 [0.46-0.91]; P < 0.05) and worsened neurologic outcome rate (OR, 0.70 [0.60-0.83]; P < 0.0001) were significantly lower in later decades, but the 4 surgical periods were similar regarding postoperative infections and hematomas. Retreatment-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) increased significantly over the 4 time frames (P < 0.05 and P < 0.0001, respectively). Multivariate analysis confirmed the improvement of surgical radicality, neurologic outcome, perioperative mortality, OS, and RFS.
   CONCLUSIONS: Meningioma surgery as well as patient population changed over the 2 decades considered in this study. We observed higher rates of gross total resection in the later period and the perioperative outcomes improved or were unchanged, which signifies better long-term outcomes, RFS, and OS.

AB BACKGROUND: Intraoperative assessment of functional connectivity (FC) provides a new possibility for mapping the eloquent brain region before, during, and after tumor resection. The aim of this study was to perform a systematic analysis of detectability of FC and its variation between subjects and sessions.
   METHODS: FC was analyzed in 10 patients with pituitary adenoma under propofol anesthesia before and after tumor resection. FC of each session (20 sessions total) was correlated to a reference matrix of a group of healthy subjects to evaluate variations of overall, interhemispheric, and intrahemispheric FC between sessions.
   RESULTS: Resting-state patterns could be detected during anesthesia (F-1,F-9 = 112.14, P < 0.001). There was a significant effect of session (F-1,F-9 = 19.401, P = 0.002), which included a reduction in resting state from the first to second session. There was no effect of connection type (F-2,F-8 = 1.498, P = 0.280), and there was no interaction between connection type and session (F-2,F-8 = 0.187, P = 0.833). The correlation between the observed reduction in resting-state activity between the sessions and the time span between sessions was not significant (r = 0.25, P = 0.29). FC of the first session showed a significant correlation to the initial dose of anesthesia (r = 0.7, P = 0.007). However, there was no significant correlation between the total dose of propofol and FC of the second session (r = 1.7, P = 0.6).
   CONCLUSIONS: Significant FC could be detected under anesthesia but showed a significant decrease in the second session. To implement FC intraoperative brain mapping, further studies are required to optimize the depth sedation to obtain stable FC between sessions.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the results of percutaneous endoscopic transforaminal diskectomy (PETD) in comparison with percutaneous endoscopic interlaminar diskectomy (PEID) for axillar herniation at L5-S1.
   METHODS: From January 2017 to March 2018, 80 patients admitted with axillar herniation at L5-S1 were randomly recruited into 2 groups: 40 cases in the PETD group and 40 in the PEID group. Each group separately underwent PETD or PEID. Patient sex, age, body mass index, axillar herniation size, number of C-arm fluoroscopies, operation time, postoperative bed time, complications, and clinical effect were compared. Both groups were followed-up using the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), visual analog scale (VAS), and Macnab criteria.
   RESULTS: Except for 1 case in the PETD group that switched to the PEID group, the patients completed the study as expected. All patients were followed-up. Preoperative demographics were not significantly different (P > 0.05) between the 2 groups. The mean number of C-arm fluoroscopies (12.44 +/- 3.21) and the operation time (66.49 +/- 16.29 minutes) of the PETD group were significantly improved compared with the PEID group (number of fluoroscopies: 3.41 +/- 0.81, P < 0.001; operation time: 53.56 +/- 10.82 minutes, P < 0.001), but the postoperative bed rest time and complication rate were not (P > 0.05). The postoperative ODI and VAS scores were obviously improved in both groups when compared with preoperation (P < 0.001). There were no significant differences between the 2 groups in the Macnab criteria or VAS and ODI scores at the same time point (P > 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: For axillar herniation at L5-S1, PEID can ignore the anatomic obstruction with advantages including a shorter operation time and less intraoperative radiation exposure. PETD has a clinical effect similar to that of PEID, but the process of it is more dangerous and harder than PEID.

AB OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the outcomes of Gamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for dural arteriovenous fistulas (dAVFs) in older patients (>= 65 years) compared with younger patients (age <65 years).
   METHODS: Two groups with a total of 96 patients were selected from a database of 133 patients with dAVF from 9 international medical centers with a minimum 6 months follow-up. A 1:2 propensity matching was performed by nearest-neighbor matching criteria based on sex, Borden grade, maximum radiation dose given, and location. The older cohort consisted of 32 patients and the younger cohort consisted of 64 patients. The mean overall follow-up in the combined cohort was 42.4 months (range, 6-210 months).
   RESULTS: In the older cohort, a transverse sinus location was found to significantly predict dAVF obliteration (P = 0.01). The post-SRS actuarial 3-year and 5-year obliteration rates were 47.7% and 78%, respectively. There were no cases of post-SRS hemorrhage. In the younger cohort, the cavernous sinus location was found to significantly predict obliteration (P = 0.005). The 3-year and 5-year actuarial obliteration rates were 56% and 70%, respectively. Five patients (7.8%) hemorrhaged after SRS. Margin dose >= 25 Gy was predictive of unfavorable outcome. The obliteration rate (P = 0.3), post-SRS hemorrhage rate (P = 0.16), and persistent symptoms after SRS (P = 0.83) were not statistically different between the 2 groups.
   CONCLUSIONS: SRS achieves obliteration in most older patients with dAVF, with an acceptable rate of complication. There was no increased risk of postradiosurgery complications in the older cohort compared with the younger patients.

AB OBJECTIVE: We studied the correlation of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings with the prognosis of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS)-related trigeminal neuralgia (TN) who had undergone percutaneous balloon compression (PBC). To the best of our knowledge, no studies have previously reported on this topic. We also performed a review of pertinent studies.
   METHODS: From a surgical series of 82 patients with TN who had undergone PBC from January 2013 to June 2017, we identified 16 patients with MS (mean age, 54.81 +/- 8.51 years; mean follow-up, 38.12 +/- 19.86 months). Using brain MRI, we evaluated the presence of a lesion in the trigeminal nerve root entry zone and trigeminal nuclei. With other clinical and procedure-related factors, we studied its effect on acute pain relief (pain free at hospital discharge) and pain-free survival (PFS).
   RESULTS: Of the 16 patients, 15 (93.75%) reported acute pain relief; 8 patients (50.00%) experienced a recurrence of pain. At the latest follow-up visit, an excellent outcome (Barrow Neurological Institute grade 1-2) was obtained for 75% of patients and a good outcome (Barrow Neurological Institute grade 3) for 25%. No patient experienced uncontrolled pain. The presence of a pear-like balloon shape during surgery (P = 0.0053) and a MRI detectable lesion in the trigeminal pathway (P = 0.049) were associated with greater PFS.
   CONCLUSIONS: PBC can be efficient in treating MS-related TN. Some factors, such as a pear-like balloon shape during surgery and evidence of a MRI-detectable lesion in the trigeminal pathway were associated with longer PFS.

   CEMENT AUGMENTATION; BALLOON KYPHOPLASTY; MRI; PREVALENCE; LEVEL
AB BACKGROUND: Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging with fat suppression (FS-MRI) is useful to detect bone marrow edema in osteoporotic vertebral fractures (OVFs) and thus can improve diagnostic accuracy and influence surgical strategy for percutaneous augmentation. The role of preoperative FS-MRI in preventing subsequent fractures after balloon kyphoplasty has not been investigated in initially subclinical fractures or fractures without obvious morphologic changes.
   METHODS: From January 2010 to December 2017, 214 consecutive patients underwent balloon kyphoplasty for painful OVFs. We defined 2 groups based on preoperative imaging (100 patients had preoperative FS-MRI and 114 patients had no MRI) and then compared baseline and surgical characteristics. The primary end point was incidence of subsequent fractures within 12 months after treatment.
   RESULTS: The 214 patients underwent kyphoplasty of 414 vertebrae. Comparing FS-MRI with no-MRI groups, spontaneous fractures occurred significantly more (58% vs. 26.3%; P < 0.001) and fractures were more often multilevel (>= 4 levels) (15% vs. 2.6%; P = 0.001), respectively. Overall incidence of subsequent vertebral fractures was 25.7% (32% in FS-MRI, 20.2% in no-MRI groups; P = 0.048). Average time to diagnosis of subsequent fractures did not differ between the 2 groups (9.3 FS-MRI vs. 11.5 weeks no-MRI; P = 0.411). Age >= 80 years at the time of balloon kyphoplasty was associated with a higher odds ratio (2.3) for subsequent fractures within 12 months (P = 0.039).
   CONCLUSIONS: Surgical treatment according to preoperative FS-MRI did not reduce occurrence of subsequent OVFs and did not prolong fracture-free intervals within 12 months after kyphoplasty.

TI When Time Is Critical, Is Informed Consent Less So? A Discussion of
   Patient Autonomy in Emergency Neurosurgery
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Emergency; Ethics; Neurosurgery
ID HEMICRANIECTOMY; STROKE
AB Neurosurgical interventions frequently occur in an emergency setting. In this setting, patients often have impaired consciousness and are unable to directly express their values and wishes regarding their treatment. The limited time available for clinical decision making has great ethical implications, as the informed consent procedure may become compromised. The ethical situation may be further challenged by different views between the patient, family members, and the neurosurgeon; the presence of advance directives; the use of an innovative procedure; or if the procedure is part of a research project. This moral opinion piece presents the implications of time constraints and a lack of patient capacity for autonomous decision making in emergency neurosurgical situations. Potential solutions to these challenges are presented that may help to improve ethical patient management in emergency settings. Emergency neurosurgery challenges the respect of autonomy of the patient. The outcome in most scenarios will rely on the neurosurgeon acting in a professional way to manage each unique situation in an ethically sound manner.

AB BACKGROUND: Patients with brain tuberculomas are generally managed with 12-18 months of antituberculous treatment (ATT) with or without surgery. However, a subset of these patients may require ATT for longer periods. We studied the factors that were associated with the need for prolonged ATT (>24 months) in patients with brain tuberculomas.
   METHODS: This retrospective study included patients with intracranial tuberculomas managed from January 2000 to December 2015 if they were followed up until completion of therapy and resolution of the tuberculoma/s. The predictive factors analyzed were the number of lesions (solitary vs. multiple), location (infratentorial vs. supratentorial and infratentorial), previous ATT treatment (yes vs. no), surgery (yes vs. no), and size of the lesion (<= 2.5 cm vs. >2.5 cm).
   RESULTS: Of the 86 patients, 19 (22%) received ATT for >2 years. On multivariate analysis, multiple lesions were significantly associated with the need for prolonged ATT (P = 0.02). Size of the tuberculoma showed a trend toward significance (P = 0.06), with tuberculomas >2.5cm having a 3.68 times increased risk of requiring prolonged ATT.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although 78% of brain tuberculomas resolve with 12-24 months of ATT, 22% required >24 months of ATT. Multiple tuberculomas had significant association with prolonged ATT, with a median duration of resolution of 36 months. Because tuberculomas >2.5 cm were likely to need longer duration of ATT, brain tuberculomas that require surgery should be excised totally or reduced in size to <2.5 cm to enable early resolution.

ID FIBER TRACKING; MINIMAL ACCESS; RESECTION; LESIONS; RETRACTION;
   DILATATION; REMOVAL
AB OBJECTIVE: Deep-seated brain tumors are often best treated by primary surgical excision. Traditional microsurgical techniques can cause retraction injury and require extensive brain dissection. To mitigate this risk, stereotactic-guided tubular retractors were developed; however, the risk of shear injury remains. We created a stereotactic-guided dilatable port system to create a corridor for deep brain tumor surgery along the trajectory of a brain needle to minimize iatrogenic brain injury.
   METHODS: Of the 8 included patients (6 colloid cysts, 1 metastasis, 1 intraventricular meningioma), 5 had undergone frameless and 3 frame-based stereotactic targeting. We used a tans-sulcal trajectory and a 2.6-mm stereotactic needle. At the target depth, the cannula was removed and the balloon inflated to 14 mm. The balloon was deflated and removed before placing the port. Pre- and 3-month post-operative magnetic resonance imaging scans were used to measure the T2-weighted signal change and residual cannulation defect. These patients were compared with a case-matched standard endoscopic port surgery cohort.
   RESULTS: All patients had undergone total lesional resection without new neurologic deficits. Patients undergoing dilatable endoscopic port surgery (DEPS) had significantly smaller residual cannulation defects (P < 0.05) but no significant differences in postoperative T2-weighted signal changes or diffusion restriction volumes at 3 months postoperatively (P > 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: DEPS might be a safe alternative to standard endoscopic port surgery or microsurgery for deep-seated brain tumors. The degree of iatrogenic injury using DEPS, as determined by magnetic resonance imaging analysis, might be equivalent to or less than that with standard port surgery techniques, although larger sample sizes are needed for validation.

ID MICROSURGICAL DREZOTOMY; CORD-INJURY; DREZ; EFFICACY
AB OBJECTIVE: To retrospectively evaluate long-term efficacy and safety of dorsal root entry zone (DREZ) lesion for treatment of neuropathic pain within the lower extremities and perineal region after thoracolumbar spine fracture.
   METHODS: Forty-two patients were treated with posterior laminectomy under general anesthesia. The DREZ regions of the spinal cord segments were ablated under a microscope. Data regarding pain relief, pain variation over time, and postoperative complications were collected. The relationship between injured spinal column segment, spinal cord, nerve root, and pain territory were analyzed retrospectively.
   RESULTS: Spinal column injury segments were located between T12 and L4. Pain territories were distributed between the T11 and S5 dermatomes with varying ranges, at an average of 2-6 segments higher than the spinal cord injury segments. Pain relief rate was 100% in 21 patients (50.0%) and was over 50% in 14 patients (33.3%). Eighteen patients (42.9%) developed temporary tingling in the upper edge of the spinal cord lesion segment after surgery. Of the 4 patients with unilateral lower extremity pain, 2 developed postoperative persistent pain in the contralateral lower extremity.
   CONCLUSIONS: For patients with neuropathic pain of the lower extremities and/or the perineal region after thoracolumbar spine fracture, pain within the lower extremities was mostly because of nerve root injury. Pain in the perineal region caused by L1 fracture was attributed to spinal cord injury segmental pain. Nerve root injury pain had a good prognosis after DREZ lesion; the effect of DREZ lesion for spinal cord injury segmental pain may be uncertain.

AB BACKGROUND: The present study evaluated the relationships among perioperative hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis (HCA), hyperchloremia, and postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients who had undergone craniotomy for intracranial hemorrhage (ICH).
   METHODS: The present retrospective cohort study included adult patients who had undergone craniotomy for traumatic or spontaneous ICH from January 2005 to December 2017. The association of perioperative hyperchloremia (serum chloride [Cl-] >110 mmol/L during postoperative days 0-3), an increase in Cl- levels (maximum Cl- level in postoperative days 0-3 minus the baseline Cl- level before surgery), and perioperative HCA (Cl- >110 mmol/L; pH <7.35, with a bicarbonate level <24 mmol/L) with the incidence of AKI was analyzed using multivariable logistic regression analysis.
   RESULTS: A total of 968 patients were included. Of these patients, 117 (12.1%) had postoperative AKI. The multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that the development of HCA was associated with a 1.850-fold increase in the incidence of postoperative AKI (odds ratio [OR], 1.850; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.102-3.106; P = 0.020). However, hyperchloremia was not significantly related to the incidence of postoperative AKI (P = 0.207). Additionally, the presence of hyperchloremia and an increase in Cl- levels were both associated with an increased incidence of HCA (hyperchloremia group: OR, 2.162; 95% CI, 1.490-3.138; P < 0.001; 1-mmol/L increase in Cl- level: OR, 1.035; 95% CI, 1.008-1.062; P = 0.011).
   CONCLUSIONS: Perioperative HCA was independently related to an increased incidence of AKI after craniotomy for ICH. An increase in Cl- levels and perioperative hyperchloremia were associated with increased development of HCA but were not significantly related to the development of postoperative AKI.

AB OBJECTIVE: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography provides useful information that can be used to optimize surgical planning and help avoid injury during subcortical dissection of eloquent tracts. The objective is to provide a safe, timely, and affordable algorithm for preoperative DTI language reconstruction for intrinsic frontotemporal diseases.
   METHODS: We reviewed a prospectively acquired database of preoperative DTI reconstruction for resection of left frontotemporal lesions over 3 years at Hospital de San Jose and Hospital Infantil Universitario San Jose, Fundacion Universitaria de Ciencias de la Salud, Bogota, Colombia. Preoperative and postoperative clinical and radiographic features were determined from retrospective chart review. A comprehensive review of the structural and functional anatomy of the language tracts was performed. Separate reconstruction of both ventral (semantic) and dorsal (phonologic) stream pathways is described: arcuate fasciculus, superior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, uncinate fasciculus, and inferior longitudinal fasciculus.
   RESULTS: Between January 2015 and January 2018, 44 tumor cases were found to be resected with preoperative fiber tracking planning and neuronavigation-guided surgery. Ten patients (7 women, 3 men) aged 28-65 years underwent resection of an intrinsic frontotemporal lesion with preoperative DTI tractography reconstruction of language tracts. Eight cases (80%) were high-grade gliomas and 2 (20%) were cavernous malformations. In 5 cases (50%), the lesion was in the frontal lobe and in 5 (50%), it was in the temporal lobe. The extent of resection was classified as gross total resection (100%), subtotal resection (>90%), or partial resection (<90%). Gross total resection was achieved in 5 cases (50%), subtotal resection was achieved in 4 cases (40%), and partial resection in the remaining case (10%). Compromised tracts included superior longitudinal fasciculus in 7 (70%), inferior longitudinal fasciculus in 4 (40%), the arcuate fasciculus in 3 (30%), and uncinate fasciculus in 1 (10%). Language function was unchanged or improved in 90% of patients. New-onset postoperative language decline occurred in 1 patient, who recovered transient phonemic paraphasias 1 month after resection. The mean follow-up time was 7 months (range, 4-12 months). Residual tumors were treated with radiation and/or with chemotherapy as indicated in an outpatient setting.
   CONCLUSIONS: We present a safe and efficacious preoperative DTI language reconstruction algorithm that could be used as a feasible treatment strategy in a challenging subset of tumors in low-to middle-income countries.

AB BACKGROUND: Contrary to expectations, some patients with poor-grade subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) show favorable outcomes. However, the factors predictive of good prognosis are unclear. The purposes of this study were to identify factors related to poor-grade SAH and to analyze preoperative prognostic factors.
   METHODS: We included 186 patients with SAH who underwent surgical clipping or conservative treatment immediately after SAH diagnosis. Physiologic, radiographic, and blood examination data were collected retrospectively. Factors related to poor World Federation of Neurological Societies (WFNS) grade (WFNS IV and V) and poor outcome (modified Rankin Scale scores 3-6) were analyzed.
   RESULTS: The patients (mean age, 61.6 years) included 134 women (72%). Seventy patients (38.2%) had poor WFNS scores. On multivariate analysis, age >= 70 years (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 3.73), midline shift (OR, 4.89), and the absence of cerebrospinal fluid in the high-convexity cortical sulci (OR, 5.47) and ambient cistern (OR, 4.83) were predictive of poor WFNS scores. Age >= 70 years (OR, 8.36), WFNS grade 5 (OR, 15.35), intracerebral hematoma (OR, 3.32), and Evans index (EI) >= 0.3 (OR, 4.40) were predictive of poor outcome. Body mass index (OR, 0.87), intraventricular hemorrhage (OR, 3.86), glycated hemoglobin level (OR, 2.78), and age >= 70 years (OR, 4.12) were predictive of EI >= 0.3.
   CONCLUSIONS: Poor outcomes correlated with older age, brain-destructive hemorrhage, and EI >= 0.3. The EI reflects both hydrocephalus and the patient's frailty. Radiographic signs of poor-grade SAH were not correlated with poor outcome, suggesting that early decompressive surgery may improve outcome.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical characteristics, treatment, and outcomes of chronic subdural hematomas (CSDH) in young patients.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed young patients under 40 years of age who received diagnoses of and were surgically treated for CSDH between August 2011 and May 2017. Clinical data, computed tomographic findings, surgical outcomes, and recurrencewere collected for further analysis.
   RESULTS: A total of 101 patients (92 male; 91.1%) were analyzed. Ages ranged from 1 to 40 years (27.3 +/- 10.5), and 59 (58.4%) patients had a history of recent head trauma. The most frequent symptoms were headache (86.1%) and dizziness (26.7%). A total of 60 (59.4%) patients had arachnoid cyst (AC), and 8 (7.9%) patients had ventriculoperitoneal (V-P) shunt. After burr hole drainage craniotomy, all patients experienced good outcomes, and 1 patient experienced recurrence requiring reoperation. Sixty-eight patients with AC/V-P shunts had a higher incidence of head trauma (P = 0.014), younger age at onset P < 0.001), and lower incidence of dizziness (P = 0.013) than did those without AC/V-P shunts. Surgical recurrence rates and outcomes did not differ significantly between patients with and without AC/V-P shunts.
   CONCLUSIONS: Headache is the most common symptom, and AC/V-P shunts are risk factors of CSDH in young patients. AC/V-P shunt-associated CSDH is associated with younger morbidity. Head trauma is a risk factor for AC/V-P shunt-associated CSDH, but is not significance in patients without AC/V-P shunts. Catheter drainage through a burr hole may be the first-choice surgical procedure in treatment of CSDH in young patients, including AC/V-P shunt-associated CSDH.

ID METAANALYSIS
AB BACKGROUND: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is an established treatment for patients with Parkinson disease. One adverse event is the development of postoperative confusion. The aim of this study was to report the incidence and associated factors of postoperative confusion after STN DBS surgery.
   METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study by chart review of patients with Parkinson disease who underwent STN DBS in a Brazilian public academic hospital from January 2013 to October 2017. The primary outcome was the incidence of postoperative confusion. The association of the outcome and imaging and clinical variables was evaluated.
   RESULTS: Among 49 patients who underwent STN DBS for Parkinson disease, the incidence of postoperative confusion was 26.5% (95% confidence interval 15%-41.1%). Univariate analysis identified the following variables associated with development of confusion: age (63.2 +/- 7.8 years vs. 55.4 +/- 9.1 years, P = 0.009), disease duration (16.5 +/- 5.1 years vs. 13.2 +/- 4.2 years, P = 0.027), Charlson comorbidity index (2 [interquartile range 1-3] vs. 1 [0-1 interquartile range], P = 0.002), width of the third ventricle (5.4 +/- 2.1 mm vs. 4 +/- 1.6 mm, P = 0.018), and cella media index (5 +/- 1 vs. 5.6 +/- 0.8, P = 0.018). After adjustment, Charlson comorbidity index remained significant (adjusted relative risk 1.64, 95% confidence interval 1.17-2.3, P = 0.004).
   CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of postoperative confusion in this cohort was 26.5%. After analysis of confounding factors, the Charlson comorbidity index was significantly associated with postoperative confusion.

AB OBJECTIVE: We investigated the 30-day complication incidence and 1-year radiographic correction in obese patients undergoing surgical treatment of cervical deformity.
   METHODS: The patients were stratified according to World Health Organization's definition for obesity: obese, patients with a body mass index of >= 30 kg/m(2); and nonobese, patients with a body mass index of <30 kg/m(2). The patients had undergone surgery for the treatment of cervical deformity. The patient baseline demographic, comorbidity, and radiographic data were compared between the 2 groups at baseline and 1 year postoperatively. The 30-day complication incidence was stratified according to complication severity (any, major, or minor), and type (cardiopulmonary, dysphagia, infection, neurological, and operative). Binary logistic regression models were used to assess the effect of obesity on developing those complications, with adjustment for patient age and levels fused.
   RESULTS: A total of 124 patients were included, 53 obese and 71 nonobese patients. The 2 groups had a similar T1 slope minus cervical lordosis (obese, 37.2 degrees vs. nonobese, 36.9 degrees; P = 0.932) and a similar C2-C7 (-5.9 degrees vs. -7.3 degrees; P = 0.718) and C2-C7 (50.1 mm vs. 44.1 mm; P = 0.184) sagittal vertical axis. At the 1-year follow-up examination, the T1 pelvic angle (1.0 degrees vs. -3.1 degrees; P = 0.021) and C2-S1 sagittal vertical axis (-5.9 mm vs. -35.0 mm; P = 0.036) were different, and the T1 spinopelvic inclination (-1.0 degrees vs. -2.9 degrees; P = 0.123) was similar. The obese patients had a greater risk of overall short-term complications (odds ratio, 2.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-6.1) and infectious complications (odds ratio, 5.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-25.6).
   CONCLUSIONS: Obese patients had a 5 times greater odds of developing infections after surgery for adult cervical deformity. Obese patients also showed significantly greater pelvic anteversion after cervical correction.

AB BACKGROUND: This prospective randomized controlled study compared the efficacy of an equiosmolar and isovolumetric dose of 3% hypertonic saline, 20% mannitol, and 10% mannitol plus 10% glycerol combination in reducing the raised intracranial pressure (ICP) in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI).
   METHODS: A total of 120 patients of severe TBI with increased ICP were randomized to receive an equiosmolar and isovolumetric dose of 3% hypertonic saline, 20% mannitol, and 10% mannitol plus 10% glycerol combination at a defined infusion rate, which was stopped when ICP was <15 mm Hg.
   RESULTS: A total of 120 patients with severe TBI (aged >18 years, Glasgow Coma Scale <= 8, and had sustained elevated ICP of >20 mm Hg for more than 5 minutes) were randomized during the study. All data were presented as mean (minimum-maximum). A one-way analysis of variance test was used to analyze the effect across the treatment group, and Tukey's method was used for multiple comparisons. A paired t-test was employed to analyze the effect of the medication within each group. All 3 drugs decreased ICP below 15 mm Hg (P < 0.0001). The maximum change in ICP occurred after a bolus dose of 3% hypertonic saline followed by 10% mannitol plus 10% glycerol combination and then 20% mannitol (60% vs. 57% vs. 55%, respectively). Mean arterial pressure and cerebral perfusion pressure were increased after the bolus dose of study medications. Maximum changes occurred after infusion of 3% hypertonic saline followed by 10% mannitol plus 10% glycerol combination and 20% mannitol (P < 0.0349 and < 0.0013, respectively). There was no statistically significant change in the hematocrit value noted after the bolus dose of any of the study medications. Serum sodium and osmolarity were raised significantly after the bolus dose of study medications. Maximum changes in serum sodium and osmolarity occurred after the bolus dose of 3% hypertonic saline. The mean dose required to reduce ICP below 15 mm Hg for 3% hypertonic saline: 1.4 mL/kg, for 10% mannitol plus 10% glycerine: 1.7 mL/kg, and for 20% mannitol: 2.0 mL/kg. The mean time required to reduce ICP below 15 mm Hg for 3% hypertonic saline: 16 minutes, for 10% mannitol plus 10% glycerine: 19 minutes, and for 20% mannitol: 23 minutes. The maximum change in the Glasgow Coma Scale occurred after the bolus dose of 3% hypertonic saline, followed by 10% mannitol plus 10% glycerol combination and then 20% mannitol.
   CONCLUSIONS: All 3 osmotic compounds exhibit comparable effectiveness in reducing ICP when a similar osmotic load is administrated, but 3% hypertonic saline appeared to be more effective followed by 10% mannitol plus 10% glycerol combination and 20% mannitol. A dose of 1.4 mL/kg can be recommended as an initial bolus dose for 3% hypertonic saline. Hypertonic saline can be recommended to treat patients with pretreatment hypovolemia, hyponatremia, or renal failure. There is no clear benefit compared with 20% mannitol in regard to neurologic outcome, even though there is a minor positive trend for 3% hypertonic saline and 10% mannitol plus 10% glycerol combination.

AB BACKGROUND: The overall survival rates for breast cancer are increasing due to controlled brain disease and improved systemic treatments. This study examined neurologic outcomes, tumor control, and survival data in breast cancer patients with multiple brain metastases and who required salvage stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for recurrent breast cancer brain metastases.
   METHODS: The study included 231 patients with a primary diagnosis of breast cancer who underwent SRS for more than 1 brain metastases from May 1993 and July 2007. Survival analyses via univariate and multivariate Cox regression demonstrated interactions between survival and predictor values including Karnofsky Performance Scale, Recursive Partitioning Analysis Class, number of brain metastases, whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT), immunotherapy, and chemotherapy.
   RESULTS: Of the 231 patients, the survival rate was 53% at 1 year and 26% at 5 years from initial SRS. Controlled systemic disease, adjuvant chemotherapy, and Recursive Partitioning Analysis class II were significant predictors of increased survival, while WBRT was a significant predictor of decreased survival. The median survival in patients who received WBRT after SRS was 11 months versus 23 months in those who did not. The local tumor control rate at initial follow-up was 95%. Of these, 40% of patients underwent additional brain SRS. Following salvage SRS, 8% of patients developed symptomatic adverse radiation events; however, the development of symptomatic adverse radiation events had no effect on patient survival.
   CONCLUSIONS: This report indicated that both initial and salvage SRS procedures in breast cancer patients with multiple brain metastases are effective for local control of intracranial disease while minimizing adverse radiation effects.

DE Fusion; Lumbar decompression; NSQIP; Spondylolisthesis
ID SPINAL STENOSIS; CLINICAL GUIDELINE; LAMINECTOMY; DIAGNOSIS
AB OBJECTIVE: When lumbar stenosis involves spondylolisthesis, many surgeons include fixation. Two recent trials have shown no consensus to definitive treatment. We aimed to add to the discourse of fusion versus decompression in patients with lumbar spondylolisthesis by providing a large-scale generalizable study.
   METHODS: We used multicenter, prospectively collected data from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database to compare 30-day outcomes for decompression alone versus combination decompression and fusion in the treatment of lumbar spondylolisthesis. Logistic regression models were used to analyze the effect of surgical type on multiple characteristics. Univariate 2-tailed chi(2) analyses were used to identify further outcome differences.
   RESULTS: In total, 9606 patients with treated lumbar spondylolisthesis were identified (907 decompression only, 8699 decompression and fusion). The fusion group tended to be younger (P < 0.001) and was more likely to be smokers (P = 0.01). Unplanned return to surgery was 3.02% in the fusion group, compared with 1.02% (P = 0.011). Minor adverse events occurred in 12.8% of the fusion group versus 4.9% (P < 0.001). Major adverse events occurred in 4.5% of the fusion group versus 3.1% (P = 0.0498). There was no significant difference in 30-day mortality, prolonged admission, or 30-day readmission.
   CONCLUSIONS: Unplanned return to the operating room and major and minor adverse events were greater for patients undergoing fusion. This could influence future decision-making in lumbar spondylolisthesis. This study indicates that further investigation is warranted but that decompression may be associated with less morbidity in the properly selected patient.

AB BACKGROUND: Patients with bilateral and/or midline/axial tremor have significant diminution in quality of life (QOL). Various studies report high complication rates with bilateral thalamotomy. However, use of primitive methods in these studies confers questionable validity. We conducted a retrospective observational cohort study in patients with medication-refractory bilateral essential tremor treated with staged bilateral radiofrequency ventral intermediate nucleus thalamotomy to subjectively examine the impact of any adverse effects on QOL and patient satisfaction.
   METHODS: Eight patients who had undergone staged bilateral radiofrequency ventral intermediate nucleus thalamotomy were included and completed a customized questionnaire. Patients returned the completed questionnaire by mail for statistical analysis.
   RESULTS: All 8 patients had improved QOL. Seven patients were satisfied with the received treatment, although residual neck and hand tremor remained in 5 and 4 patients, respectively. None of the patients reported worsening of symptoms or severe disability in any area. Adverse effects included speech difficulty, difficulty in concentration, memory loss, and calculation difficulty. All 8 patients were self-reliant in doing everyday tasks that were not possible before the treatment suggesting the nondisabling nature of the adverse effects that occurred.
   CONCLUSIONS: Adverse effects that are nondisabling and hence acceptable to the patient can be considered acceptable adverse effects. Staged bilateral radiofrequency ventral intermediate nucleus thalamotomy definitely improves QOL in patients with medication-refractory bilateral essential tremor despite occurrence of acceptable adverse effects.

DT Article
DE Clinical; Outcomes; Recovery; TBI; Trajectory; Trial
ID TEMPORAL PROFILE; MORTALITY; SCALE
AB BACKGROUND: Prospects for recovery after traumatic brain injury (TBI) are often underestimated, potentially leading to withdrawal of care in the comatose TBI patient who may ultimately have a favorable outcome with aggressive care. Outcomes and trajectories of recovery in a large series of patients with TBI were evaluated at 30, 90, and 180 days postinjury.
   METHODS: A secondary analysis of the phase 3 Citicoline Brain Injury Treatment (COBRIT) trial was performed analyzing recovery trajectories and long-term outcomes at 30, 90, and 180 days postinjury. A Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOS-E) score of 5 or higher was considered favorable. Pearson chi(2) analysis was used, and a P value of 0.05 was considered significant. A locally weighted, polynomial regression model was used to model recovery trajectories in a nonlinear fashion.
   RESULTS: Subjects with TBI in the COBRIT trial had high rates of favorable outcome (57% of severe TBI, 86% of moderate TBI, and 93% of complicated mild TBI) at 6-month follow-up. These favorable outcomes often converted from high rates of unfavorable outcome at initial 1-month follow-up (85% of severe TBI, 57% of moderate TBI, and 21% of complicated mild TBI). Recovery trajectories had not plateaued at 6 months, suggesting that further improvement occurs beyond 6 months postinjury.
   CONCLUSIONS: In this secondary analysis of the COBRIT trial, most patients had favorable outcomes by the GOS-E at 6 months postinjury in all complicated mild and moderate TBI groups, with over half of patients with severe TBI achieving a favorable outcome as well. Of subjects in a vegetative state (GOS-E score 2) at 1 month postinjury, 18% improved to a favorable outcome by 6 months postinjury. There was substantial improvement in all groups from 1 to 6 months, and this improvement may continue beyond 6 months. Clinical trials in TBI should consider recovery curves with repeated measures to assess outcomes because arbitrary single-moment outcome determination likely underestimates treatment effect in TBI care.

AB OBJECTIVE: To compare vertebral morphology among patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS), patients with Chiari I malformation (CMS)-associated scoliosis, and normal control subjects, with the goal of determining the role of anterior column overgrowth in the development of AIS.
   METHODS: One hundred and forty adolescent girls were enrolled (50 with AIS, 40 with CMS, and 50 control subjects). Thoracic computed tomography images were obtained for all subjects. Anterior height of the vertebral body (VBHa), posterior height of the vertebral body (VBHp), and height of the pedicle (PH) were measured for each level. Finally, the ratios of VBHa and VBHp to PH were calculated and compared among the 3 groups.
   RESULTS: Compared with the control group, both the AIS and CMS groups exhibited consistently longer VBHa and VBHp for most thoracic vertebral bodies, whereas the PH of most vertebral bodies was shorter in both AIS and CMS groups. Moreover, the ratios for differential growth between the anterior and posterior elements of each thoracic vertebra in both the AIS and CMS groups were significantly larger than the ratios in the control group. However, for all mentioned parameters, there were no significant differences between the AIS and CMS groups.
   CONCLUSIONS: Faster growth of the anterior spinal column was confirmed by longer vertebral bodies and shorter pedicles in both patient groups. Relative anterior spinal overgrowth of the thoracic spine is not involved in the initiation of AIS, and the abnormal growth pattern of the vertebral body in AIS might be a secondary change to the spinal curve.

ID INFORMATION; QUALITY
AB BACKGROUND: Gamma Knife radiosurgery was introduced in the 1960s and is currently used worldwide. The internet has become a foremost source of information used by patients and their families. In this study, we aim to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of the Gamma Knife radiosurgeryerelated YouTube videos.
   METHODS: We searched YouTube and the first 3 pages sorted according to "Relevance-Based Ranking" were included for analysis. Four independent health care workers from different disciplines evaluated the videos using the validated DISCERN tool.
   RESULTS: Our search resulted in 65,774 videos, and 14 videos met inclusion criteria. Our study found that 50% (7 of 14) of the videos were uploaded by university-affiliated hospitals; 14% of videos scored 3. The search term "Radiosurgery for intraaxial brain lesions" had the highest percentage of moderate videos (DISCERN = 3) (50%).
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients and caregivers turn to online sources to gather information about the disease. However, the available YouTube published videos are published without proper academic monitoring, as in such a free platform, published videos tend to catch a general audience for different purposes, which leads to diminishing quality control. Academic medical institutions should consider a proper monitoring process for videos to improve the accuracy of the published information for the patients.

AB OBJECTIVE: For effective minimally invasive lumbar decompression, we changed the routine of segmental decompression. Using a high-speed drill or an ultrasound knife, we created a working channel, starting at the base of the spinous process of the upper vertebra slightly above the disc level, to target and decompress the contralateral recess, and termed it the translaminar crossover decompression (TCD). We evaluated the feasibility and compared the outcomes of a navigation-guided endoscopic translaminar crossover approach for segmental decompression (eTCD) in elderly patients with microscopic decompression using the same approach (mTCD).
   METHODS: A total of 740 elderly patients were enrolled in a prospective cohort study. Of the 740 patients, 297, who had undergone mTCD, and 253, who had undergone eTCD, completed a 1-year follow-up visit. In addition to the surgical data, numerical rating scales (NRSs) for back and leg pain, the Core Outcome Measures Index and Oswestry Disability Index were recorded preoperatively and 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery. The MacNab criteria were supplemented by qualitative assessment of the patients' postoperative pain-free walking distance.
   RESULTS: A comparison of the preoperative and postoperative clinical scores showed significant improvement after TCD in both cohorts (P < 0.01): Oswestry Disability Index, from 50.3% +/- 12.6% to 15.5% +/- 7.43%; NRS (back), from 6.9 +/- 1.9 to 2.5 +/- 1.3; NRS (leg), from 8.0 +/- 0.85 to 1.6 +/- 0.33; Core Outcome Measures Index (back), from 7.8 +/- 2.0 to 2.7 +/- 1.5. No statistically significant differences were found in the outcomes between the 2 cohorts.
   CONCLUSIONS: TCD inherently eliminated central stenosis and facilitated decompression of both recesses via mutual undercutting, with preservation of facet joint integrity.

ID OUTCOME ANALYSIS; COMPLICATIONS; PLACEMENT
AB OBJECTIVES: External ventricular drain (EVD) placement is required frequently in neurosurgical patients to divert cerebrospinal fluid and monitor intracranial pressure. The usual practice is the tunneled EVD technique performed in operating theaters. EVD insertion through a bolt in intensive care also is described. We employ both practices in our institute. Herein, we compare the indications, accuracy, safety, and costs of the 2 techniques.
   METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of a prospectively maintained EVD database of all patients undergoing first frontal EVD placement between January 2010 and December 2015. Those patients with preceding cerebrospinal fluid infection were excluded. We compared bolt EVD with tunneled EVD techniques in terms of accuracy of EVD tip location by analyzing computed tomography scans to grade catheter tip location as optimal (ipsilateral frontal horn) or otherwise suboptimal, and complications that include infection and revision rates.
   RESULTS: In total, 579 eligible patients aged 3 months to 84 years were identified; 430 had tunneled EVDs and 149 bolt EVDs. The most frequent diagnosis was intracranial hemorrhage (73% bolt vs. 50.4% tunneled group; P < 0.001). Other diagnoses included tumor (4.7% bolt vs. 19.1% tunneled; P < 0.001) and traumatic brain injury (17.5% bolt vs. 17.4% tunneled). In the bolt EVD group 66.4% of EVD tips were optimal, compared with 61.0% in the tunneled group (P = 0.33). Infection was confirmed in 15 (10.0%) bolt EVDs compared with 61 (14.2%) tunneled EVDs (P = 0.2). Each bolt EVD kit costs 260 pound, whereas placing a tunneled one in the theater costs 1316 pound.
   CONCLUSIONS: Bedside bolt EVD placement is safe, accurate, and cost effective in selective patients with hemorrhage-related hydrocephalus.

AB BACKGROUND: Atypical meningioma is a heterogeneous group of tumors with an unpredictable behavior. Our objectives were to study patients with atypical meningioma, monitor their follow-up, identify the histologic characteristics, and analyze factors associated with severe outcomes.
   METHODS: This retrospective study involved 28 patients with atypical meningioma from 1994 to 2014. The histologic samples were reviewed under current criteria. The association with recurrence and survival was analyzed statistically for clinical, therapeutic, histologic, and molecular factors.
   RESULTS: The average age at the time of diagnosis was 55.5 years (range, 18-83 years) and 57% were female. Total resection (Simpson grade I) was performed in 10 cases (38%). Adjuvant radiotherapy was given to 13 patients. During the 77-month follow-up, 64% had a recurrence or progression. The average time to first recurrence and overall survival were 43.83 months and 149 months, respectively. Recurrence was found in 85% of the patients whose samples presented necrosis. Of the tumors, 84% showed a high mitotic index (4-20 mitoses/10 high-power field). Of the 4 patients with a low mitotic index (<4 mitoses/10 high-power field), the degree of resection was subtotal and 3 experienced disease progression. Of patients with Ki67 >9.9%, 67% had recurrence. The degree of resection was the only variable significantly associated with tumor recurrence.
   CONCLUSIONS: The high rate of recurrence observed and the short disease-free survival exemplify the unpredictable behavior of atypical meningiomas. Total resection was the only significant factor associated with recurrence. However, the presence of atypical features, such as necrosis or high Ki67, is frequent in patients with disease progression.

ID NORMATIVE DATA; FORNIX; 3RD-VENTRICLE; ANTEROGRADE; RESECTION; AMNESIA;
   SCORES
AB BACKGROUND: Colloid cysts (CC) have been associated with neurocognitive function (NCF) decline, both preoperatively and after resection. Factors such as local pressure on the fornix and hydrocephalus are thought to contribute to preoperative NCF decline. The potential cause of postoperative decline is thought to be forniceal injury during surgery. In the current series, we describe NCF outcomes amongst patients with CC, both nonoperated and operated.
   METHODS: A total of 36 patients (23 operated, 13 nonoperated) were included in this retrospective study. All patients underwent at least 1 NCF evaluation battery. Of the 13 nonoperated cases, 5 had follow-up tests too. Of the 23 operated, 14 had both pre- and postoperative tests, and 8 had early and late postoperative tests.
   RESULTS: There was no significant difference in baseline NCF between nonoperated and operated cases (as evaluated preoperatively). Nonoperated patients had a stable NCF test over time. Patients who were operated showed a significant improvement after surgery in several NCF variables. There was no significant change in NCF between early and late postoperative evaluation. None of the operated patients had a postoperative NCF decline.
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CC should undergo routine NCF testing with a standardized protocol, whether they are operated or followed. Surgery has a positive impact on NCF; however, it remains to be determined if the improvement is solely secondary to treatment of hydrocephalus, or to a reduction of local pressure on the fornices. It remains to be determined whether the surgical technique, that is, endoscopic, interhemispheric, or transcortical, has an impact on NCF outcome.

AB OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present review was to describe the evolution of the damage control concept in neurotrauma, including the surgical technique and medical postoperative care, from the lessons learned from civilian and military neurosurgeons who have applied the concept regularly in practice at military hospitals and civilian institutions in areas with limited resources.
   METHODS: The present narrative review was based on the experience of a group of neurosurgeons who participated in the development of the concept from their practice working in military theaters and low-resources settings with an important burden of blunt and penetrating cranial neurotrauma.
   RESULTS: Damage control surgery in neurotrauma has been described as a sequential therapeutic strategy that supports physiological restoration before anatomical repair in patients with critical injuries. The application of the concept has evolved since the early definitions in 1998. Current strategies have been supported by military neurosurgery experience, and the concept has been applied in civilian settings with limited resources.
   CONCLUSION: Damage control in neurotrauma is a therapeutic option for severe traumatic brain injury management in austere environments. To apply the concept while using an appropriate approach, lessons must be learned from experienced neurosurgeons who use this technique regularly.

ID INTRACRANIAL MENINGIOMAS; SKULL BASE; CHILDHOOD
AB BACKGROUND: Meningiomas are the second commonest intracranial tumors in many places worldwide. They are rare in the pediatric age group, however, and most studies have been able to document only a few patients. Meningiomas in pediatric patients have also been shown to behave differently from those in the adult population. This study was done to examine histologic types of meningiomas seen in pediatric patients from a predominantly African population using the 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) grading system for intracranial tumors.
   METHODS: Data from the operating logs of patients and histology reports of the samples sent to the pathology department during the study period were extracted. The data obtained were the age, sex, location of the intracranial tumor, histologic diagnosis, WHO grade, and tumor recurrence.
   RESULTS: Nine pediatric age patients were found among the 166 surgically excised meningiomas received at the pathology department in our institution over a 19-year period. The age range was from 8 months to 17 years. There was a male-to-female ratio of 1:2 with a female predominance. Six tumors were basally located. All tumors were WHO grade I with transitional meningiomas being the commonest followed by meningothelial. There was no history of recurrence in any of the tumors after complete surgical excisions.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed the rarity of meningiomas in the study population, and there was a predominance of basally located tumors.

   GRADE I; RECURRENCE; RADIOTHERAPY; EXTENT
AB OBJECTIVE: Maximal aggressive meningioma resection has been suggested to provide the best tumor control rates. However, radical surgery of meningiomas located at the frontal skull base can be accompanied by impairment of adjacent cranial nerve function that negatively affects patients' quality of life. We, therefore, analyzed our institutional database for cases of new cranial nerve deficits and postoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage stratified by the extent of tumor resection.
   METHODS: From February 2009 to April 2017, 195 patients underwent resection of frontal skull base meningioma at our institution. Postoperative new deficits of cranial nerve function and CSF leakage were stratified by the resection into Simpson grade I resection with excision of the dural tail as an aggressive surgical approach and Simpson grade II-V resection.
   RESULTS: Simpson grade I resection was associated with a significantly greater percentage of new cranial nerve deficits immediately after surgery (30%) compared with Simpson grade II (13%; P = 0.007) and Simpson grade II-V (17%; P = 0.035). The differences were greater at the 12-month follow-up point (29% Simpson grade I, 6% Simpson grade II [P < 0.001]; 10% Simpson grade II-V [P = 0.001]). Postoperative CSF leakage occurred in 10.1% of Simpson grade I versus 2.3% of Simpson grade II resections (P = 0.048). The retreatment rates did not differ between these 2 groups (2.5% vs. 3.4%; P = 1.000).
   CONCLUSIONS: We found high levels of new cranial nerve morbidity and CSF leakage after radical removal of frontal skull base meningiomas that included the adjacent dura. Thus, less aggressive surgery for frontobasal meningioma should be preferred.

ID HUMAN BRAIN; LONGITUDINAL FASCICULUS; IN-VIVO; ANATOMY; TRACTOGRAPHY;
   HUMANS
AB OBJECTIVE: White fiber dissection using a gyrus-based approach was performed to study the various associations, commissural, and projection fiber bundles of the brain.
   METHODS: Ten previously frozen and formalin-fixed cadaveric human brains were included. The fiber dissection techniques described by Klingler were used. The primary dissection tools were thin handmade wooden spatulas and curved metallic spatulas with tips of various sizes. The fibers were studied by the naked eye and with the use of magnification. The various fiber bundles were studied using a gyrus-based approach. The dissection was performed through each named gyrus, and the fiber tracts encountered during dissection were identified, and their relationship to other adjacent fiber bundles was studied.
   RESULTS: From our dissections, the white fibers of the brain were divided architecturally into 5 groups-4 horizontal groups and 1 vertical group. The 4 horizontal groups were the superficial, middle, deep, and central groups. The association fibers constituted the superficial, middle, and deep groups. The commissural fibers formed the central group, and the projection fibers formed the vertical group. The course of the fiber bundles and their functional co-relationship were determined.
   CONCLUSIONS: When planning the surgical trajectory, knowledge of the location of white matter tracts is essential to help minimize the occurrence of postoperative deficits. Fiber dissection using the Klingler technique is useful in gaining an understanding of the complex 3-dimensional nature of these white matter tracts and can provide a valuable resource in neurosurgical training.

TI Coil Embolization for Cerebral Aneurysms Using a Semi-Jailing Technique
   and Open-Cell Stent

DT Article
DE Coil embolization; Open-cell stent; Semijailing technique
ID NECKED INTRACRANIAL ANEURYSMS; ASSISTED COILING; ENDOVASCULAR TREATMENT;
   APPOSITION; DEPLOYMENT
AB BACKGROUND: Numerous reports have described the semi-jailing technique (SJT) using a closed-cell stent for stent-assisted coil embolization, revealing issues including poor expansion and thrombotic complications in curved vessels. This paper reports preliminary experience with SJT using an open-cell stent, a novel type of stent allowing stent placement from a microcatheter.
   METHODS: First, this research investigated differences between open-and closed-cell types in SJT using silicone vessel models. Next, 43 patients who underwent SJT for the internal carotid artery were divided into 2 groups to investigate treatment outcomes: 24 patients with placement of an open-cell stent (open-cell group) and 19 patients with closed-cell stents (closed-cell group).
   RESULTS: In the silicone vessel model, coils could be placed with the open-cell stent deployed with a shorter length than the closed-cell stent. No significant differences were found between groups in terms of maximum diameter of the aneurysm or dome-neck ratio. The open-cell group showed a trend toward higher complete embolization immediately after surgery (54.2% vs. 26.3%, P = 0.06), with few cases of stent malapposition (0% vs. 31.6%, P < 0.01). However, 1 case of ischemic complication in the closedcell group and 1 case of hemorrhagic complication in open-cell group occurred. All cases of modified Rankin Scale scores at discharge were 0-1.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although the open-cell stent carries the disadvantage of an unresheathable design, coil placement with a shorter stent deployment length may be advantageous during SJT for internal carotid artery aneurysm embolization with favorable consequences for excellent vessel wall apposition.

AB OBJECTIVE: Pituitary adenomas comprise about 3% of all intracranial tumors in pediatric patients. This study examines the role of stereotactic radiosurgery in the management of pediatric acromegaly or patients with Cushing disease (CD).
   METHODS: From an international consortium, we retrospectively collected treatment and outcome data on pediatric adrenocorticotrophic hormone and growth hormonee secreting pituitary adenomas treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS). There were a total of 36 patients including 24 with CD and 12 with acromegaly. The data were analyzed to assess outcomes including tumor control, endocrine remission, and adverse effects. Statistical analysis was performed to determine correlation between clinical/treatment parameters and outcomes.
   RESULTS: At the last follow-up after GKRS, endocrine remission rates for CD and acromegaly were 80% and 42%, respectively. Tumor control was achieved in 87.5% of patients with CD and in 42% of patients with acromegaly. New pituitary hormone deficiency occurred in 7 of the 36 patients at a median time of 18 months after GKRS (range, 12-81 months). The predictive factors for endocrine remission were age <15 years (P = 0.015) and margin dose (P = 0.042). The median endocrine follow-up was 63.7 months (range, 7-246 months).
   CONCLUSIONS: GKRS affords reasonable rates of endocrine remission and tumor control in most pediatric patients with functioning adenomas. The most common post-GKRS complication was hypopituitarism, although this occurred in only a few patients. Given the larger at-risk period for pediatric patients, further study is required to evaluate for delayed recurrences and hypopituitarism.

DE Endoscopy; Intraventricular cyst; Neurocysticercosis
ID CYSTICERCAL CYSTS; 4TH-VENTRICLE; HYDROCEPHALUS; PREVALENCE; MANAGEMENT;
   DIAGNOSIS; REMOVAL
AB BACKGROUND: Poor sanitation, poor hygiene, and archaic cooking practices have led to neurocysticercosis (NCC) being endemic in India. Apart from a cortical location that leads to seizures, intraventricular NCC can present with hydrocephalus and sudden deterioration in sensorium. Consequently, endoscopic excision plays an important role in its treatment because a dilated ventricle offers a minimally invasive and less traumatic route to the pathology.
   METHODS: All endoscopically excised intraventricular NCC cases operated were retrospectively analyzed from 2014 to 2017, discussing surgical nuances and postoperative outcome.
   RESULTS: Twelve such cases were found (mean age, 21.9 +/- 8.36 years; 9 men and 3 women). The mean follow-up period was 21.17 +/- 13.96 months (range, 2-40 months). The most common site was the aqueduct and fourth ventricle.
   CONCLUSIONS: An endoscopic approach is a feasible and safe tool for treating this disease. Technical nuances such as entry point and trajectory of endoscope need to be kept in mind while operating.

AB BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to identify predictors for postacute care facility discharge for patients undergoing posterior cervical decompression and fusion (PCDF) and to determine if discharge placement impacts postdischarge outcomes.
   METHODS: Patients undergoing PCDF from 2012 to 2015 were queried from the NSQIP database (n = 8743) and separated by discharge placement. Outcomes included nonhome discharge, unplanned 30-day readmission, and adverse events (AEs), both before and after discharge. Demographics and comorbidities were analyzed using bivariate analysis. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify predictors for nonhome discharge, readmission, and severe AE after discharge.
   RESULTS: Patients with nonhome discharges were significantly older (67.4 vs. 58.6 years; P < 0.001), sicker (82% vs. 54% American Society of Anesthesiologists >2; P < 0.001), and more functionally dependent (16% vs. 3.4%; P < 0.001), with a greater comorbidity burden. Patients with PCDF had an increased likelihood of nonhome discharge if they had a dependent functional status (odds ratio [OR], 2.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.33-3.82; P < 0.001), diabetes (OR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.13-1.55; P = 0.0007), and an American Society of Anesthesiologists >2 (OR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.5-2.05; P < 0.001), as well as if they were older (OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.05-1.06; P < 0.001) and female (OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.14-1.5; P = 0.0002). Patients with PCDF with nonhome discharges had an increased likelihood of having a severe postdischarge AE (OR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.26-2.33; P = 0.0006) and an unplanned readmission (OR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.15-1.82; P = 0.002).
   CONCLUSIONS: Results of this cross-sectional study suggest that patients with PCDF discharged to a postacute care facility have a higher likelihood of having a severe AE after discharge as well as a higher likelihood of being readmitted.

AB BACKGROUND: Depression is a prevalent and disabling condition associated with spinal cord injury (SCI). Such associated negative factor warrants the use of valid and reliable psychological assessment tools among this group. One of the available assessment means is the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), a short screening measure that evaluates depression status. Our aim is to test the psychometric properties of the Arabic version of the PHQ-9 including validity and reliability among Lebanese individuals with SCI.
   METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study conducted between January and June 2018, including 51 participants with SCI. Questionnaire and assessment measures were administered to the subjects. The internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and the factor structure of the PHQ-9 were evaluated in addition to the convergent validity, which was established by comparing the scale's total score with the scores of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale.
   RESULTS: Exploratory factor analysis revealed 3 factors accounting for 66.2% of the total variance. The scale demonstrated good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.71) and test-retest reliability (Intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.88). Significant correlation was found between the PHQ-9 and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (r = 0.71) suggesting good convergent validity.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the PHQ-9 has good psychometric properties and is a valid and reliable measure of depression among the Lebanese individuals with SCI.

ID SPINE SURGERY; TRANSFUSION; REDUCTION
AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy and safety of a prophylactic intravenous administration of tranexamic acid (TXA) 30 minutes before skin incision on perioperative blood loss in patients treated with posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF).
   METHODS: A total of 63 patients who underwent PLIF were recruited and divided into a TXA group (n = 26) and a control group (n = 37). Intraoperative blood loss, postoperative blood loss, duration of tube drainage, hospitalization time, blood transfusion rate, and incidence of complications were compared between the 2 groups.
   RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the demographic characteristics and laboratory results between the 2 groups. The intraoperative blood loss, 24-hour postoperative drainage volume, 24-hour postoperative hidden blood loss, perioperative overt blood loss, hospitalization time, and postoperative duration of tube drainage were significantly reduced in the TXA group compared with the control group. In addition, the perioperative blood transfusion rate was lower in the TXA group (7.7%) than in the control group (16.22%), but the difference was not statistically significant. During a 3-month follow-up period, no pulmonary embolism, liver failure, or renal dysfunction was observed in the 2 groups. Likewise, the incidence of deep venous thrombosis was not found in the TXA group compared with 1 case in the control group, hence the difference was not statistically significant.
   CONCLUSIONS: A prophylactic intravenous administration of TXA 30 minutes before skin incision effectively reduces the perioperative blood loss, duration of tube drainage, and hospitalization time, and it does not increase the risk of complications. However, TXA may not be able to decrease the rate of blood transfusion.

AB BACKGROUND: Anterior or posterior decompression has been widely used to treat patients with ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL). However, when OPLL extends to the C2 level, the complex anatomic structures around the C2 vertebral body and postoperative destabilization or kyphosis would make it difficult to perform anterior or posterior surgery. This study proposed a novel technique named "shelter technique" to deal with C2 OPLL.
   METHODS: Sixteen patients with cervical OPLL involving the C2 segment were included. The OPLL below C2 was dealt with anterior controllable antedisplacement and fusion, including diskectomy of involved levels, resection of the anterior vertebral bodies, installation of the intervertebral cages and anterior cervical plate, isolation of the vertebrae-OPLL complex (VOC), and the final hoisting of the VOC. When dealing with C2 OPLL, the posterior portion of the C2 vertebral body was resected to create the shelter based on the thickness of the C2 OPLL, which could provide space for further antedisplacement of the ossified mass behind the C2 vertebra. Finally, OPLL behind C2 was moved forward together with the antedisplacement of VOC below C2.
   RESULTS: Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography scan showed sufficient decompression of the spinal cord, including the C2 segment, and the shelter provided enough space for the antedisplacement of the ossified mass behind the C2 segment. At the final follow-up of 1 year, neurologic function of all patients recovered significantly.
   CONCLUSIONS: The shelter technique can be relatively effective and safe for patients with OPLL involving the C2 segment. However, further studies with more cases and longer follow-up will be required to reveal the surgical value of the technique.

DE Cell-free DNA; Glioma; Liquid biopsy; Whole exome sequencing
AB OBJECTIVES: To analyze the plasma cell-free DNA (CfDNA) in glioma patients with high throughout sequencing for a novel non-invasive method for the early diagnosis and management of glioma.
   METHODS: Six patients with glioma were recruited from the Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University from June 2015 to September 2016. Their plasma samples were tested for Cf-DNA by whole exon sequencing and mutations were analyzed by bioinformatics.
   RESULTS: After filtering the raw sequencing data of CfDNA, 33,173 mutations were obtained from 12,462 genes of which 442 genes and 655 mutation sites were identical to that in the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer database. However, when we compared the Cf-DNA data with the glioma mutated loci in the Cancer Genome Alta database, only 4 mutations matched with the glioma sequences in the Cancer Genome Alta and did not correspond to that of the paired-tumor tissues.
   CONCLUSIONS: There were some cancer-related somatic mutations in the Cf-DNA of glioma patients, but no identical mutations were found in the paired solid tumors. Therefore, plasma Cf-DNA mutations may not be a suitable marker for the detection of glioma.

AB BACKGROUND: Prediction of traumatic brain injury (TBI) among children is of great importance for accurate clinical decision making.
   OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the prognostic value of the Rotterdam scoring system in predicting early outcome among children with TBI.
   METHODS: This study was conducted in 2017 on 506 children with brain injury in Kashan, Iran. A checklist was used to collect demographic and clinical characteristics of patients such as age, sex, mechanism of trauma, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, need for surgery, and brain injury outcome. Moreover, each participant's computed tomography scan was evaluated and scored using the Rotterdam system. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and the best cut-off score were calculated for the Rotterdam system. The relationships of the Rotterdam score with participants' characteristics were examined using the chi(2) test, whereas the predictors of brain injury outcome were identified using the logistic regression analysis.
   RESULTS: Pediatric death rate was 4.3%. Most deaths were among children who were male, aged < 4, had developed brain injury owing to traffic accidents, had a GCS score of 3-8, suffered from compressed skull fracture and frontal lobe injury, had cerebral edema, and had a Rotterdam score of 5. The sensitivity and specificity of a Rotterdam score 3 were 86.4% and 97.9%, respectively. The logistic regression analysis indicated that only GCS and Rotterdam scores were significant predictors of brain injury outcome.
   CONCLUSIONS: At a cut-off score of 3, the Rotterdam system can be used to predict TBI outcome among children with acceptable sensitivity and specificity.

DT Review
DE Early-onset scoliosis; Magnetically controlled growing rod;
   Meta-analysis
ID COMPLICATIONS; CHILDREN; SURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: The goal of the current systematic review and meta-analysis was to explore the utilization of a magnetically controlled growing rod (MCGR) for the treatment of early-onset scoliosis based on eligible studies demonstrating efficacy.
   METHODS: Online electronic databases were searched to identify the eligible studies updated to April 2018 according to index words. Several studies in the literature that were relevant to the present analysis were also included. Mean difference or relative risk along with 95% confidence interval was used to analyze the main outcomes.
   RESULTS: Eleven studies were included in the meta-analysis with 186 patients in the MCGR group and 64 patients in the conventionally growing rod (CGR) group; 3 studies were case control studies, and 8 studies were self-control studies. The results indicated that MCGR had significantly decreased the Cobb angle and thoracic kyphosis and increased T1-T12 and T1-S1 distances. In addition, the incidence of complications after MCGR therapy was 0.37%. However, there was no significant difference in the change of Cobb angle and incidence of complications between the MCGR and CGR groups.
   CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that MCGR significantly reduced the Cobb angle and thoracic kyphosis while markedly increasing T1-T12 and T1-S1 distances. However, a close comparison of MCGR with CGR reveals more high-quality randomized control trials with a larger sample size and long-term follow-ups are necessary to gather more robust evidence on the efficacy of MCGR for early-onset scoliosis.

DT Article
DE Clipping; Coiling; Outcome; Ruptured posterior communicating artery
   aneurysm; Treatment
ID ENDOVASCULAR-COILING; INTRACRANIAL ANEURYSMS; TRIAL; OCCLUSION
AB BACKGROUND: Very few data stratify the functional outcome of ruptured posterior communicating artery (PCoA) aneurysm treatment based on each treatment strategy. Therefore, the authors aimed to evaluate the outcome of PCoA aneurysm treatment to compare the clipping and coiling techniques and find the factors that determined the treatment outcomes.
   METHODS: Patients with ruptured PCoA aneurysm at Songklanagarind Hospital between November 2002 and March 2018 were retrospectively reviewed and classified into the clipping group or the coiling group. The primary outcome was the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 6 months after treatment, and the patients were stratified into "good outcome" (mRS 0-2) and "poor outcome" (mRS 3-6). Using logistic regression analysis, various factors were analyzed for association with the treatment outcome.
   RESULTS: This study included 189 patients: 104 and 85 patients in the clipping and coiling groups, respectively. Patients in the coiling group were significantly older, with more underlying diseases. However, the treatment outcomes at 6 months were not significantly different between the 2 groups. The percentages of poor outcomes in the clipping and coiling groups were 28% and 31%, respectively (P = 0.734). Older age, seizure, higher Hunt and Hess grade, deterioration before aneurysm obliteration, an aneurysm on the left side, and a medially projected PCoA aneurysm were statistically significantly correlated with poor outcomes.
   CONCLUSIONS: Neurosurgical clipping and endovascular coiling are effective treatments for aneurysm obliteration in ruptured PCoA aneurysm. An aneurysm on the left side and a medially projected PCoA aneurysm were the factors correlated with poor outcome.

TI Use of a New Indocyanine Green Pooling Technique for Improved

DT Article
DE Dural AV fistula; Indocyanine green; Video angiography; Visualization
ID ARTERIOVENOUS-FISTULAS; CLINICAL-FEATURES; SURGICAL-TREATMENT;
   VIDEOANGIOGRAPHY; MANAGEMENT; ANGIOGRAPHY; EXPERIENCE
AB BACKGROUND: Intraoperative indocyanine green video angiography (ICG-VAG) is a useful tool in cerebral vascular surgery. In spinal procedures such as dural arteriovenous (AV) fistula, use of ICG-VAG is limited due to lower perfusion pressure. Therefore, we developed a new pooling technique with adapted workflow to improve intraoperative visualization.
   METHODS: Patients operated on spinal dural AV fistulas using ICG-VAG were prospectively included. A new workflow for ICG-VAG was applied: 1) temporary clip placement at the suspected fistula point, 2) ICG administration during 100% oxygenation, 3) ICG pooling proximal of temporary clip, 4) clip removal/observation of vascular filling. Case records, clinical data, magnetic resonance imaging, digital subtraction angiography (DSA), and clinical outcome were analyzed retrospectively.
   RESULTS: A total of 11 patients (median age 68 years, average course of disease 15 months) were included. Optimized, inverted workflow resulted in considerable pooling of ICG in the supplying feeder of the AV fistula in all cases. Complete obliteration was confirmed in 10 of 11 patients by postoperative DSA. However, 1 patient had an additional, preoperative radiologically undetected small feeder that enlarged until postoperative DSA and made successful reoperation necessary. After the median follow-up of 33.2 months, the Aminoff-Logue scale was decreased in all patients, and the McCormick score (modified Rankin score) was improved in 9 (8) patients and remained stable in 2 (3) patients.
   CONCLUSIONS: Procedure modification in terms of ICG pooling enabled us to detect more easily the pathologic vascular architecture. ICG-VAG is a useful adjunct in the surgical treatment of spinal dural AV fistula because it is a real-time, noninvasive, and radiation-free technique with adequate image resolution.

AB OBJECTIVE: The incidence of meningiomas increases with increasing age. Because the median age for the diagnosis is 65 years, the patients' general health condition, comorbidities, and procedural risks will influence the postoperative functional outcomes. The aim of our study was to assess the long-term impairments of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) after meningioma resection in different age groups of elderly patients.
   METHODS: We analyzed the HRQOL of 133 patients aged >54 years at surgery who had undergone surgical meningioma resection from 2004 to 2010. The median age was 67.3 +/- 7.4 years. The average interval between surgery and questionnaire completion was 3.8 +/- 2.5 years. Six different 5-year age groups were established. The patients completed the Medical Outcomes Study short-form 36-item questionnaire, and the results were compared with general population values. The Kruskal-Wallis test and Mann-Whitney U test were used for statistical analysis.
   RESULTS: We found significantly lower levels of physical function, vitality, social role functioning, mental health, and general health perception and significantly greater levels of pain between the older age groups (in particular, 75-79 years) and younger patients aged 55-59 years. The physical component summary showed a steadily and stepwise decline from younger to older patients. However, the most significant differences in HRQOL were not related to age but to comorbidities.
   CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that Karnofsky performance scale and American Society of Anesthesiologists scores have a strong effect on long-term HRQOL, especially for older patients after meningioma resection. These data should be a substantial consideration in the preoperative decision-making process.

AB BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) results in both focal and diffuse brain pathological features that become severely exacerbated after the initial injury. Owing to this disease complexity, no effective therapeutic measure has yet been devised aimed directly at these pathological processes. We developed a clinically relevant model of TBI and tested the bidirectional neuroprotective role of adenosine 2A receptors (A2ARs) at different times.
   METHODS: Wistar rats were divided into 4 treatment groups (sham, TBI, A2AR agonist [CGS-21680], and A2AR antagonist [SCH-58261]) and 4 post-TBI intervals (15 minutes and 1, 12, and 24 hours). A2AR agonist and antagonist effects were tested by the neurological functional score (NFS) and levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate, interleukin-1 beta, oxidative stress antioxidant markers, and caspase-3.
   RESULTS: The A2AR agonist-treated group showed significant NFS improvement at 15 minutes and 1 hour after TBI compared with the TBI group. However, no improvement was observed at 12 and 24 hours. The A2AR antagonists resulted in no NFS improvement at 15 minutes and 1 hour, and significant improvement observed at 12 and 24 hours. Significant neuroprotective effect with an A2AR agonist were observed with cyclic adenosine monophosphate, interleukin-1 beta, oxidative stress markers, catalase, and caspase-3 levels at 15 minutes and 1 hour after TBI. The A2AR antagonist showed no effect at these intervals but showed a protective effect at 12 and 24 hours after TBI.
   CONCLUSIONS: The A2AR agonist showed a beneficial neuroprotective effect at the early stages after TBI, and the A2AR antagonist showed a benefit at the later stages after TBI. These findings suggest that A2AR agonists and antagonists should be used in accordance with the point at which the TBI occurred.

AB OBJECTIVE: Guidelines may reduce practice variation and optimize patient care. We aimed to study differences in guideline use in the management of traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients and analyze reasons for guideline nonadherence.
   METHODS: As part of a prospective, observational, multicenter European cohort study, participants from 68 centers in 20 countries were asked to complete 72-item questionnaires regarding their management of severe TBI. Six questions with multiple sub-questions focused on guideline use and implementation.
   RESULTS: Questionnaires were completed by 65 centers. Of these, 49 (75%) reported use of the Brain Trauma Foundation guidelines for the medical management of TBI or related institutional protocols, 11 (17%) used no guidelines, and 5 used other guidelines (8%). Of 54 centers reporting use of any guidelines, 41 (75%) relied on written guidelines. Four centers of the 54 (7%) reported no formal implementation efforts. Structural attention to the guidelines during daily clinical rounds was reported by 21 centers (38%). The most often reported reasons for nonadherence were "every patient is unique" and the presence of extracranial injuries, both for centers that did and did not report the use of guidelines.
   CONCLUSIONS: There is substantial variability in the use and implementation of guidelines in neurotrauma centers in Europe. Further research is needed to strengthen the evidence underlying guidelines and to overcome implementation barriers.

AB OBJECTIVE: We aimed to expound feasibility of serum cell-free microRNA-214 (miR-214) as a noninvasive biomarker for glioma in this study.
   PATIENTS AND METHODS: We detected expression of miR-214 in medium from 2 glioma cell lines to confirm whether it is secretory in screening phase. Then, we verified cell-free miR-214 expression in serum samples from an independent set of 100 preoperative patients with glioma, 30 matching postoperative patients, and 100 healthy controls.
   RESULTS: MiR-214 was secreted from glioma cell lines. Extracellular miR-214 levels were significantly overexpressed in preoperative serum from glioma patients with glioma, whereas its expression significantly decreased in matched postoperative serum. Upregulated cell-free miR-214 in serum was significantly associated with higher tumor grade, absence of isocitrate dehydrogenase, and unmethylated methylguanine methyltransferase promoter. Extracellular miR-214 in serum could effectively distinguish patients with glioma from healthy control (area under the curve = 0.885; 95% confidence interval, 0.833-0.926). Moreover, serum cell-free miR-214 was an independent prognostic indicator of overall survival for patients with glioma.
   CONCLUSIONS: Serum cell-free miR-214 could serve as a promising noninvasive biomarker of glioma in tumor stratification, early diagnosis, and prognostic evaluation.

ID ENDOSCOPIC RESECTION
AB OBJECTIVE: The diagnosis and management for juvenile psammomatoid ossifying fibroma (JPOF) of the skull base are challenging, and clinical data are limited.
   METHODS: A retrospective review of JPOF was performed, and the clinical characteristics, treatment strategy, and prognosis were analyzed.
   RESULTS: There were 23 patients pathologically confirmed with JPOF, most with JPOF located in the skull base area (19/23, 82.6%). Of those tumors, 43.5% presented with dura matter breakthrough. Most of the chief complaints were headache (n = 8, 34.8%) and visual impairment (n = 5, 21.7%). Most of the tumors were solid tumors with spherical appearance, frequently accompanied by cysts of various size (n = 14, 60.9%). Craniotomy, mostly via the frontal approach, was the most common approach in the present series, comprising 73.6% (17/23) of all cases. The endoscopic endonasal approach was performed in 6 cases (26.1%). In total, 62.5% of patients (15/23) underwent gross total resection, 8.7% of patients (2/23) underwent subtotal resection, and 26.1% of patients (6/23) underwent partial resection. After a mean follow up of 66.1 +/- 36.1 months (range, 3-124), 3 patients (13.6%) suffered from tumor recurrence with a mean recurrence time of 13 months.
   CONCLUSIONS: The present series of skull base JPOFs showed that radical surgery combined with skull base reconstruction contributed to overall good prognosis. Further studies are needed to evaluate the long-term outcomes and to characterize its pathologic characteristics.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and accuracy of use of a 3-dimensional printed navigation template in the placement of a cortical bone trajectory (CBT) screw in the middle-upper thoracic spine.
   METHODS: Ten human cadavers were included in the study. Sixty CBT screws were placed on 1 side, using the free-hand technique, and 60 CBT screws were placed on the other side, using the navigation template that was designed and printed using data from 10 cadavers. The safety and accuracy of use of the CBT screws were directly evaluated by radiography and computed tomography.
   RESULTS: Computed tomography revealed that 2 and 3 of 60 screws, placed using the navigation template, were broken in the medial or lateral areas and in the superior or inferior pedicle wall, respectively. Furthermore, 8 screws were broken in the medial or lateral areas and 11 screws were broken in the superior or inferior pedicle wall when the free-hand technique was used. Radiography revealed that 3 screws in zone I, 55 screws in zone II, and 2 screws in zone III were placed using the navigation template. Furthermore, 7 screws in zone I, 45 screws in zone II, and 8 screws in zone III were placed using the free-hand technique.
   CONCLUSIONS: In this cadaver study, insertion of the CBT screws in the middle-upper thoracic spine with the assistance of the navigation template was safe and convenient.

TI Are Anterior Communicating Aneurysms Truly Anterior Communicating
   Aneurysms? An Observational Study
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Anterior communicating aneurysm; Subarachnoid hemorrhages
ID ARTERY ANEURYSMS; ENDOVASCULAR TREATMENT; RUPTURE; RISK
AB OBJECTIVE: The term anterior communicating (ACom) aneurysm is often broadly used to classify any aneurysm formed on the A1-A2 junction, A1, A2, or ACom arteries. Aneurysm location has been associated with rupture risk, so whether an aneurysm is truly formed on the ACom artery can critically affect treatment decisions. The aim of this study was to reclassify broadly termed ACom aneurysms into 4 subgroups (A1, A2, true ACom, and A1-A2 junction) based on their location.
   METHODS: A retrospective, pilot study was conducted to identify all consecutive patients with ACom aneurysm managed over the past 4 years in a single center. Using computed tomography angiography, aneurysms were classified into 1 of the 4 subgroups. Additional information was collected on patient demographics, subarachnoid hemorrhages, projections of aneurysm dome, and aneurysm diameter.
   RESULTS: A total of 48 aneurysms with available computed tomography angiography imaging were included in the final analysis. The reclassification of ACom aneurysms into subgroups resulted in 40 A1-A2 junction, 6 true ACom, 2 A2, and zero A1 aneurysms. A total of 100% versus 80% of true ACom and A1-A2 junction aneurysms ruptured, respectively. All elective coiling procedures were performed on unruptured A1-A2 junction aneurysms.
   CONCLUSIONS: We found only 13% of the aneurysms initially referred to as ACom to be true ACom aneurysms. A more nuanced approach to ACom aneurysm classification may better guide management strategies.

   SAFETY
AB BACKGROUND: Dural substitutes used during hemicraniectomy provide a barrier and dissection plane during subsequent cranioplasty. A recent review by our group showed that use of dural substitutes in hemicraniectomy is associated with reduction in estimated blood loss (EBL) and operative time (OT). In our experience, the use of a dual-layer technique facilitates a dissection plane with minimal adhesions. We hypothesized that use of this dual-layer technique would show decreased OT and EBL in patients undergoing cranioplasty.
   METHODS: We conducted a retrospective case-control study comparing use of single-layer versus dual-layer duraplasty on cranioplasty operative outcomes. Data on dual-layer cases were collected from patients who underwent cranioplasty from 2013 to 2017. These data were matched to controls from 2008 to 2012. Patients were identified by query of a neurosurgical database of all procedures performed at our institution. Patients were included if they had complete surgical records for cranioplasty. Cases and controls were compared with a Student t test, chi(2) test, or Fisher exact test.
   RESULTS: A total of 78 controls and 45 cases met inclusion criteria. All baseline characteristics between cohorts were similar except for surgical indication. Mean OT (102.97 minutes vs. 102.18 minutes) and mean EBL were not significantly different (204.66 mL vs. 190 mL) between cohorts.
   CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we did not detect any significant difference between EBL and OT with use of single-layer versus dual-layer duraplasty. Mean EBL was slightly higher in the controls compared with cases but this difference was not statistically or clinically significant. This concept would benefit from a prospective randomized study.

AB OBJECTIVE: To compare the observation of high-grade glioma (HGG) based on intraoperative multiplane ultrasonography (US) images and preoperative reconstructive coplanar T1-weighted enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using volume navigation (V Nav) fusion image technology.
   METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated intraoperative data obtained from 16 patients diagnosed with HGG (grade III and IV). Overall, 18 nodules observed in 15 patients were examined. HGG images from US and contrast-enhanced US (CEUS) were compared with those from preoperative reconstructive coplanar enhanced T1-weighted MRI using automatic V Nav fusion image technology.
   RESULTS: All HGG tumors were detected. Images of 13 of 18 tumors (72.2%) with obscure margins using B-mode US were improved with clear tumor boundaries using CEUS imaging. The relative difference in tumor area between CEUS and enhanced MRI modalities in 14 mainly solid component lesions was considered statistically significant (P value < 0.05). There was a perfect correlation of the enhanced area between coplanar CEUS and enhanced MRI.
   CONCLUSIONS: The V Nav fusion image system combining intraoperative real-time US imaging with reconstructive preoperative coplanar MRI is valuable for imageguided HGG resection. It is suitable for neurosurgeons who lack the expertise in US technology to discern the brain structure and allows better recognition of tumor and edema tissues comparedwith reconstructive preoperative coplanar-enhanced MRI in real time and in multiplane from different angles. In addition, CEUS combined with B-mode US could improve tumor detection and resection control in neurosurgery, even in single US-guided operations.

AB BACKGROUND: Self-locking stand-alone cages can achieve satisfactory clinical results and fusion rate. However, there have been no reports on the causes and relationship of different fusion state. This study is to classify the different fusion states of the index level and to explore the potential contributing factors and links of them.
   METHODS: From June 2008 to October 2011, 42 patients underwent anterior cervical discectomy and fusion with MC+ cages. More than 5 years' follow-up was reviewed. The fusion state and the relevant clinical and radiologic records were reviewed retrospectively.
   RESULTS: At the last follow-up, the fusion proportion of type I, II, III, and IV was 11.7%, 16.9%, 26.9%, and 42.9%, respectively. The overall fusion rate was 97.4%. For all the fused types, significant improvement for the visual analog scale, Japanese Orthopaedic Association, and Neck Disability Index scores was found at the last follow-up (P < 0.05). However, there were no significant differences between the 4 types (P > 0.05). For sagittal vertical axis, type IV was significantly larger than that of type I, II, and III (P < 0.05), and for range of motion, type III was significantly larger than that of type II and IV (P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: For anterior cervical discectomy and fusion with self-locking stand-alone cages, the fusion of the index level seems to be a progressive dynamic process during the mid-term follow-up, which may be influenced by the location of the cage, the aagittal vertical axis of the index level, and the global range of motion of the cervical spine. Satisfactory clinical results could be achieved by all the fused types.

AB OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship between intervertebral disk degeneration and endplate microvasculature, and to determine the role of apoptosis in the pathophysiology underlying end plate microvasculature.
   METHODS: Twelve 6-month-old rabbits were randomly divided into group A (control group where animals underwent a sham operation, in which the loading device was implanted but without loading) and group B (degeneration group, where a calibrated spring within the loading device would immediately create static shear force of 50 N to the disk of L4-5). Paraffin-embedded midsagittal sections of the L4-5 disk were obtained 4 weeks after surgery in the both groups. Sections were stained with cluster of differentiation (CD) 31 immunohistochemistry to measure the blood vessel density in the endplate, with CD31 immunofluorescence and terminal dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) to detect the apoptosis of vascular endothelial cells in the endplate.
   RESULTS: After 4 weeks, the microvasculature density was 91 +/- 8 vessels/mm(2) in group A and 47 +/- 2 vessels/mm(2) (P < 0.001) in group B, demonstrating that vessels were reduced in the endplate of intervertebral disk degeneration. CD31 immunofluorescence and TUNEL showed that apoptosis of vascular endothelial cells exists in the endplate of intervertebral disk degeneration.
   CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that apoptosis of vascular endothelial cells results in a decrease in endplate microvasculature density, further affecting the pathologic process of intervertebral disk degeneration.

AB OBJECTIVE: To describe the technique of a small extended bifrontal approach and review the clinical outcome of patients with midline anterior skull base (MASB) meningiomas treated using this technique.
   METHODS: The small extended bifrontal craniotomy extends inferiorly to the nasofrontal suture without entering the orbit, superiorly 3 cm above the supraorbital rim, and laterally 3 cm to the midline on both sides. A review of a prospectively acquired database was performed of 54 consecutive patients with MASB meningiomas who underwent this craniotomy.
   RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients with olfactory groove meningiomas, 2 with planum sphenoidale meningiomas (PSMs), and 23 with tuberculum sellae meningiomas (TSMs) were treated using this technique. Gross total resection was achieved in all patients. Of 29 patients with olfactory groove meningiomas, 12 (41.4%) had normal olfaction at presentation and 8 had preservation of olfaction postoperatively. Of 25 patients with TSMs/PSMs, 23 (92.0%) had preoperative visual impairment, with 13 showing improved vision (56.5%), 8 unchanging (34.8%), and 2 deteriorating (8.7%) after surgery. The most common complications were anosmia and hyposmia, which occurred in 5 patients (20.0%) and 3 patients (12.0%) with TSMs/PSMs, respectively. No mortality was reported. There was no recurrence in all patients after a mean follow-up of 39.5 months (range, 16-64 months).
   CONCLUSIONS: The small extended bifrontal approach is a safe and effective technique for resection of MASB meningiomas, which provides adequate surgical exposure with less approach-related morbidity. It is an excellent alternative for surgeons who favor the bifrontal approach and its extended variations.

AB PURPOSE: To analyze and compare safety and efficacy of different endovascular treatment modalities for unruptured intracranial large or giant aneurysms.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 126 consecutive patients with 128 large (15-24 mm) or giant (>= 25 mm) aneurysms that were treated with different endovascular procedures between January 2014 and February 2017. We compared clinical and angiographic outcomes and occurrence of technical events among 3 treatment modalities.
   RESULTS: Complete occlusion at last follow-up was achieved in 65.6%, 90.5%, and 72.0% of aneurysms in stent-assisted coiling, parent artery occlusion, and Pipeline embolization device (PED) groups (P = 0.119). Complete occlusion rate at 6-month follow-up (odds ratio = 1.81, P = 0.396) and at last angiographic follow-up (odds ratio = 3.64, P = 0.123), was not superior with parent artery occlusion compared with PED. Retreatment rate was significantly different among all groups (P < 0.001); the rate was highest in the stent-assisted coiling group (21.9%). Rates of hemorrhagic events and ischemic events were not significantly different among groups (P = 0.581). Mass effect exacerbation was more frequently seen in the stent-assisted coiling group (24.4% vs. 7.7% and 3.3%, P = 0.004). Major complication rate was higher in the parent artery occlusion group compared with the PED group, but the difference was not statistically significant (19.2% vs. 16.4%, odds ratio = 1.21, P = 0.763). Rate of technical events was significantly different in the 3 groups (P = 0.0437), and technical events occurred more often in the PED group (18.0%).
   CONCLUSIONS: For large and giant aneurysms located in the internal carotid artery, outcome for endovascular treatment remains poor, even with the introduction of PED.

AB BACKGROUND: Overlapping stents represent a new paradigm in endovascular interventions, especially for complex and wide-necked aneurysms. The low-profile visualized intraluminal support (LVIS) device is a new generation of self-expanding braided stents recently introduced in China for stent-assisted coiling of intracranial aneurysms. We report several cases of intracranial aneurysms coiled using overlapping LVIS stents to evaluate its efficacy and safety.
   METHODS: Patients with ruptured intracranial aneurysms treated with double LVIS stents at our center between November 2014 and May 2016 were reviewed. The clinical data and technical results are presented.
   RESULTS: Ten patients with 15 aneurysms were treated with double LVIS stents, with a 100% technical success rate. No mortality was observed. Immediate angiographic outcome evaluation showed complete occlusion in 13 aneurysms (86.7%) and neck remnants in 2 aneurysms (13.3%).
   CONCLUSIONS: Double LVIS stents are safe and effective in the treatment of intracranial aneurysms, especially complex aneurysms.

AB OBJECTIVE: To explore the differences among grades of recanalization on outcomes of endovascular treatment for acute anterior large vessel occlusion with small infarct core beyond the 6-hour time window.
   METHODS: Patients beyond the 6-hour time window with Alberta Stroke Program Early Computed Tomography Score >7 were retrospectively enrolled from the endovascular treatment for acute anterior circulation ischemic stroke (ACTUAL) registry. They were divided into 3 groups according to the degree of recanalization: modified treatment in cerebral infarction (mTICI) 0-2a, 2b, and 3. We compared the differences of outcomes among groups on modified Rankin Scale score at 90 days, symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage within 72 hours, and mortality.
   RESULTS: A total of 101 patients were enrolled. Median time from onset to groin puncture was 415 minutes (interquartile range: 387-497 minutes). Favorable functional outcomes were significantly better in patients with successful recanalization than in patients with failed recanalization (mTICI 0-2a, 22.7% [5/22]; mTICI 2b, 48.0% [12/25]; and mTICI 3, 61.1% [33/54]; trend P = 0.01). Complete recanalization (mTICI 3) (odds ratio, 5.34; 95% confidence interval, 1.71-16.66; P = 0.004) was associated with good functional outcome. Mortality was different among groups at 90 days (mTICI 0-2a, 36.4% [8/22]; mTICI 2b, 0, [0/25]; P = 0.001; mTICI 0-2a, 36.4% [8/22]; mTICI 3, 9.3% [5/54]; P = 0.008; and mTICI 2b, 0, [0/25]; mTICI 3, 9.3% [5/54]; P = 0.173). There were no significant differences of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage among groups (mTICI 0-2a, 22.7% [5/22]; mTICI 2b, 12.0% [3/25]; and mTICI 3, 9.3% [5/54]; P = 0.28).
   CONCLUSIONS: For acute anterior circulation stroke patients, who were beyond the 6-hour time window, yet with small ischemic core, complete recanalization following endovascular treatment may play the most important role on clinical outcome.

AB OBJECTIVE: The role of maxillofacial trauma in dementia risk is not well established. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between craniofacial trauma, including facial bone fracture and traumatic brain injury (TBI), and dementia.
   METHODS: Using Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database, we identified 501,889 adults who had had >= 1 medical record of craniofacial trauma between 2000 and 2010 and did not have a dementia diagnosis at baseline. Diagnoses of craniofacial trauma, including facial bone fracture and TBI, and dementia were made using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes. The standardized incidence ratio was used to determine whether craniofacial trauma was associated with a greater risk of incident dementia compared with the general population. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to predict the risk of dementia among the trauma cohort by comparing the patients with and without comorbidities.
   RESULTS: A total of 501,889 patients with craniofacial trauma were included, of which 1.5% (n = 7804) developed dementia. Facial bone fracture (standardized incidence ratio, 1.58; 95% confidence interval, 1.25-2.00) was shown to be associated with an increased dementia risk compared with the general population. In addition, craniofacial trauma accompanied with postinjury comorbidities was associated with an increased risk of dementia during follow-up periods compared with the group without comorbidities.
   CONCLUSIONS: Craniofacial traumas, especially facial bone fracture, were associated with an increased risk of subsequent dementia. Maintaining a high index of suspicion for associated TBIs in all patients with facial trauma is crucial, even if no obvious initial signs and symptoms of brain injury are observed.

AB OBJECTIVE: We sought to explore whether additional bone grafting of the atlantoaxial joint increases the bone fusion rate of iliac crest autograft in posterior occipitocervical fusion surgery.
   METHODS: From January 2012 to January 2016, a total of 78 patients who had basilar invagination with occipitalization of the atlas came to our tertiary spine center. Except for those lost to follow-up (10 cases) or who had a followup time < 2 years (20 cases), there were 48 patients retrospectively included in this study. In the control group, a piece of autogenous iliac corticocancellous bone was placed between the occipital and C2 vertebral lamina for fusion. In the hybrid fusion group, besides posterior occipitocervical autograft, some granular bone harvested from the iliac crest was packed into the bilateral atlantoaxial joint. X-ray imaging and cervical computed tomography (CT) were performed during follow-up.
   RESULTS: The operations were completed successfully in all patients without intraoperative complications. Only 21 (87.5%) patients in the control group had confirmed posterior bony fusion on CT, while 24 (100%) patients in the hybrid fusion group had confirmed posterior bony fusion. There were postoperative implant-related complications in 2 patients. Both cases belonged to the control group (8.3%). Three patients (12.5%) complained of transient numbness in the posterior occipital region: 2 patients in the hybrid group and 1 patient in the control group. The mean duration to posterior occipitocervical fusion was 5.5 months in the hybrid fusion group versus 6.1 months in the control group (P = 0.757). Of note, in the hybrid fusion group, the process of atlantoaxial joint fusion was faster than that of posterior occipitocervical fusion (5.1 months vs. 5.5 months, P = 0.823).
   CONCLUSIONS: Additional bone grafting of the atlantoaxial joint could increase the bone fusion rate of iliac crest autograft in posterior occipitocervical fusion.

AB OBJECTIVE: To compare bony spur resection (BR) with bony spur nonresection (BN) treatment in patients with congenital scoliosis and type I split cord malformation.
   METHODS: Patients with congenital scoliosis and type I split cord malformation who underwent corrective surgery in a single institution from 2008 to 2015 were retrospectively evaluated. Patients were divided into 2 groups according to whether BR was performed or not: the BR group included 12 patients, and the BN group included 20 patients. Complications and perioperative and radiographic data were recorded and compared.
   RESULTS: The study included 32 patients. Mean age at surgery was 14.3 years, and average follow-up period was 2.8 years. There were no statistically significant differences in correction rate of the major curve or other radiographic parameters at final follow-up. Preoperative concerns (6.8 vs. 5.8, P = 0.006), operative times (508.5 minutes vs. 311.3 minutes, P = 0.009), blood loss (1433.3 mL vs. 1015.8 mL, P = 0.064), and hospital charges ($22,387.80 vs. $15,706.8, P = 0.032) were lower in the BN group than in the BR group. Total and major complication rates were higher in the BR group than in the BN group, even though there were no statistically significant differences (58.3% vs. 30.0% and 8.3% vs. 5.0%, respectively).
   CONCLUSIONS: In patients with congenital scoliosis and type I split cord malformation, not resecting the bony spur can achieve satisfactory radiographic and clinical outcomes with potentially fewer complications.

   TRENDS
AB OBJECTIVE: Few studies have examined the outcomes of open reduction and internal fixation of vertebral fractures. The purpose of this study was to determine patient-related and surgery-related risk factors associated with 30-day postoperative mortality after open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of cervical, thoracic, and lumbar vertebral fractures.
   METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of data from the 2010-2014 ACS-NSQIP database. Adult patients who underwent ORIF of vertebral fractures in the cervical, thoracic, or lumbar spine were included. Patients were divided into 2 groups on the basis of the occurrence of 30-day postoperative mortality. A univariate analysis was performed to compare baseline patient characteristics, comorbidities, operative variables, and 30-day postoperative complications between the mortality and non-mortality groups. A subsequent multivariate regression analysis adjusting for patient and operative factors was then performed to identify independent risk factors for 30-day mortality.
   RESULTS: A total of 900 patients who underwent vertebral ORIF were included. The overall 30-day postoperative mortality rate was 1.56%. The mortality group had a higher incidence of pneumonia, pulmonary complications, cardiac complications, blood transfusion, sepsis, and prolonged hospitalization. Multivariate regression analysis identified pulmonary comorbidity and diabetes as independent predictors of 30-day mortality following ORIF of vertebral fractures.
   CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary comorbidity and diabetes were found to be independent risk factors for 30-day mortality after ORIF of vertebral fractures. Recognizing these risk factors is important in preoperative risk stratification, perioperative care, and patient counseling.

ID DISKECTOMY; EFFICACY; SURGERY
AB OBJECTIVE: Prevertebral soft tissue swelling (PSTS) is a known complication of anterior cervical fusion (ACF). Prior studies have shown that perioperative steroids may reduce PSTS after ACF. We retrospectively evaluated the role of perioperative intravenous (IV) corticosteroid administration in minimizing radiographic PSTS measurements in patients undergoing ACF for degenerative disease.
   METHODS: Records of 100 consecutive patients undergoing ACF for degenerative disease (Current Procedural Terminology code 63075) from January 2010 through December 2012 by 2 orthopedic spine fellowship-trained surgeons at a single institution were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were included on the basis of specific criteria. They were then separated into comparison and IV steroid groups. Demographic and surgical data were collected. Last, measurements of PSTS, which included PSTS ratio and PSTS index (PSTSI), were obtained from plain radiographs preoperatively and at 3 postoperative time points.
   RESULTS: Eighty patients were included; 26 received IV steroids at the surgeon's discretion (12 intraoperatively, 11 postoperatively and 3 at both time periods). With the exception of a history of prior anterior cervical spine surgery (3.70% comparison vs. 23.08% IV steroid, P = 0.01), there was no statistically significant demographic characteristic. Furthermore, there was no statistically significant surgical characteristic. Last, there was no statistically significant difference between groups at any time point for either PSTS ratio at any level or PSTSI.
   CONCLUSIONS: There does not appear to be a role for perioperative IV steroid administration in minimizing radiographic PSTS in patients undergoing ACF for degenerative disease. The relationship between perioperative IV steroid administration and PSTS requires further investigation.

   Ventricular system
ID MEDICAL-EDUCATION; LIVER; SKULL
AB BACKGROUND: The ventricular system is a set of brain cavities without solid tissues and the basis of surgical brain anatomy. To the best of our knowledge, the effect of using 3-dimensional (3D) printed models (3DPMs) on anatomy education of the ventricular system has not been reported.
   METHODS: We established 3DPMs for the ventricular system and performed a randomized controlled study to evaluate the educational effect of 3DPMs, 3D images (3DIs), and 2-dimensional images (2DIs). We randomly divided 60 second-year medical students into 3 groups, with 3DPMs, 3DIs, and 2DIs used as teaching aids, 1 for each group. Before and after the anatomy class on the features of ventricular system, all students completed the same test.
   RESULTS: No statistical significant differences were detected between the mean values of the pretest scores of the 3 groups (P > 0.05). For the post-test scores, the students in the 3DPM and 3DI groups performed significantly better than those in the 2DI group in terms of the practice test score (3DPM group vs. 2DI group, P < 0.001; 3DPM group vs. 2DI group, P = 0.009) and total score (3DPM group vs. 2DI group, P = 0.001; 3DI group vs. 2DI group, P = 0.025). From the students' evaluation results, the 3DPM group performed better than the 3DI group for "enjoyment" and "attitude" (P = 0.039 and P = 0.025, respectively).
   CONCLUSIONS: Compared with 2DIs, use of 3DPMs and 3DIs could improve the effectiveness of teaching the anatomy of the complex ventricular system. In addition, 3DPMs could markedly increase the interest and enthusiasm of students.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the risk factors of tumor-related epilepsy (TRE) and the relationship between TRE and functional/survival outcomes in patients with high-grade glioma (HGG).
   METHODS: The clinical data of 587 patients with HGG were retrospectively analyzed. A chi(2) test and logistic multiple-regression analysis were used to analyze factors associated with TRE. Logistic and Cox regression were used to analyze factors that may influence functional and survival outcomes.
   RESULTS: Glioma location in temporal (odds ratio [OR], 0.439; P = 0.04) and parietal lobes (OR, 0.092; P = 0.02) were independent protective factors of preoperative epilepsy, compared with gliomas of frontal lobe. Preoperative epilepsy (OR, 9.290; P < 0.001) and dominant hemispheric location (OR, 2.616; P = 0.04) were independent risk factors of postoperative epilepsy. On univariate analysis, patients with preoperative epilepsy had longer progression-free survival (PFS) (P = 0.001) and overall survival (OS) (P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis further confirmed that preoperative epilepsy was an independent protective factor of OS (hazard ratio, 0.587; P = 0.008).
   CONCLUSIONS: In patients with HGG, preoperative epilepsy is significantly associated with tumor involvement of the frontal lobe, whereas postoperative epilepsy is associated with preoperative epilepsy and dominant hemispheric location. Also, patients with HGG with preoperative epilepsy have better PFS and OS.

AB OBJECTIVE: Primary intraventricular hemorrhage (PIVH) is a rare condition in adult patients. PIVH occurs frequently in adult hemorrhagic Moyamoya disease (MMD). Idiopathic PIVH is defined as PIVH without cerebrovascular abnormalities. This study is aimed to compare the baseline characteristics and outcomes of acute MMD-related and idiopathic PIVH.
   METHODS: Adult patients with acute MMD-related or idiopathic PIVH were retrospectively included. Baseline characteristics and outcomes at discharge were obtained and compared. Chi-square test, Student's t-test, or rank-sum test were used in statistical analyses.
   RESULTS: This study finally included 32 patients with acute MMD-related PIVH and 112 with acute idiopathic PIVH. Patients with acute MMD-related PIVH were significantly younger (53.3 +/- 15.8 vs. 42.8 +/- 12.2 years, P < 0.001). The admission systolic blood pressure in patients with acute idiopathic PIVH was significantly higher (161.7 +/- 30.9 vs. 134.6 +/- 24.6 mm Hg, P < 0.001). Patients with acute idiopathic PIVH had significantly higher admission serum urea (5.68 +/- 2.66 vs. 4.34 +/- 1.62 mmol/L, P = 0.008), cystatin C (0.97 +/- 0.72 vs. 0.68 +/- 0.16 mg/L, P = 0.023), and uric acid (309.01 +/- 105.97 vs. 242.24 +/- 77.65 mu mol/L, P = 0.001). In patients with acute MMD-related PIVH, only one (3.1%) patient was dead at discharge. In contrast, a total of 22 (19.6%) patients with acute idiopathic patients died at discharge (P = 0.027).
   CONCLUSIONS: Compared with patients with acute idiopathic PIVH, patients with acute MMD-related PIVH have younger age, lower blood pressure, and better renal function. Moreover, patients with acute MMD-related PIVH have lower short-term mortality.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate long-term outcome and reoperation rate for microsurgical bilateral decompression via unilateral approach of lumbar spinal stenosis, a common degenerative spinal disease of the lumbar spine.
   METHODS: In this observational prospective study, 918 patients were treated for single-level or multilevel lumbar spinal stenosis by bilateral decompression via unilateral approach between January 2002 and January 2016. Of 918 patients, 180 underwent microdiscectomy with decompression. Follow-up consisted of radiologic investigations, Oswestry Disability Index questionnaire, and 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey at 6 and 12 months postoperatively.
   RESULTS: There were 492 female patients (53.6%) and 426 male patients (46.4%) with a mean age of 63.83 +/- 10.16 years (range, 43-79 years). Symptom duration was 4-49 months. Average follow-up time was 98 months (range, 25-168 months), and reoperation rate was 2.5%. Oswestry Disability Index scores decreased significantly (from 30.65 +/- 7.82 to 11.32 +/- 2.50 at 6 months and 11.30 +/- 2.49 at 12 months), and 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey parameter scores demonstrated a significant improvement in the early and late follow-up results.
   CONCLUSIONS: Bilateral decompression via unilateral approach for lumbar spinal stenosis allowed a sufficient and safe decompression of the neural structures, resulting in a highly significant reduction of symptoms and disability, acceptable reoperation rate, and improved health-related quality of life.

AB OBJECTIVE: Management of meningiomas with major dural venous sinus involvement is challenging. We present our case series and perspective on reconstruction of the sinuses.
   METHODS: Fifty-five patients underwent operations between 2005 and 2016 and the retrospective data were collected and analyzed.
   RESULTS: The cohort was younger with a mean of 51.3 years (range, 19-72 years) predominantly involving the superior sagittal sinus (44 patients). Sinus involvement was classified into group 1 (<50% of sinus, n = 28), group 2 (50%-99%, n = 8), and group 3 (total occlusion, n = 19). Venous collateralization was present in 100% of group 2 and 3 and in 36% of group 1 occlusions. Sinus pericranii was seen in 22 patients. Gross total resection was achieved in 87.2%, and sinus reconstruction followed in 38 patients (24 by direct suture and 14 by a patch graft). Pathology showed 36 (65%) World Health Organization grade I, 18 (33%) grade II, and 1 (2%) grade III tumors. During the mean follow-up of 60 months (range, 1-132 months), sinus was patent (74%) or narrowed but patent (24%) in 98%; 2 recurrences (3.6%) were observed (at 24 and 120 months). The mean preoperative/postoperative Karnofsky Performance Status and Kaplan-Meier cumulative overall/recurrence-free survival were 84.2%/88.1% and 90.9%/80.1%, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: These meningiomas present in a younger population, are more likely to be World Health Organization grade II or III, necessitating a more aggressive tumor resection strategy. Aggressive resection coupled with sinus reconstruction results in good long-term surgical outcome and low recurrence rates.

ID SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; ACTIVATION
AB BACKGROUND: Postoperative contact selection of deep brain stimulation (DBS), testing one contact at a time, is a clinically time-consuming procedure being challenged by incoming applications of more complex DBS leads. The objective of this study is to guide clinicians to select the optimal contact by neuroanatomic information derived from electrode reconstruction.
   METHODS: We reviewed 33 patients with Parkinson disease who underwent bilateral subthalamic nucleus (STN) DBS with preoperative magnetic resonance imaging and postoperative computed tomography scan. All electrodes were reconstructed in standardized Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital space, and the volume of tissue activated (VTA) was estimated for each contact. According to the DISTAL atlas, we calculated 6 neuroanatomic parameters: the distances of each contact to the STN and the motor part of the STN (M-STN), the volumes of the overlapping areas of the VTA and STN/M-STN, and the number and ratio of fiber tracts through both the VTA and motor areas (primary motor cortex and supplementary motor area).
   RESULTS: All 6 parameters showed significant group differences between clinical optimal and nonoptimal contacts by permutation test. Moreover, the possibility of being the optimal contact was estimated for all contacts under the combination of these 6 parameters using a generalized linear model, which resulted in accuracy of 72.7% for prediction of contact selection.
   CONCLUSIONS: Electrode reconstruction could assist in selecting the clinical optimal contact and improving its efficiency.

AB OBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the therapeutic effects in clinical and radiologic outcomes of a self-locking stand-alone cage (SSC) and cage-with-plate (CP) for multilevel anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF).
   METHODS: A systematic search was performed for all comparative studies reported up to August 2018. Operative time, hospital stay, intraoperative blood loss, Japanese Orthopedic Association score, Neck Disability Index (NDI), cervical and segmental Cobb angle, intervertebral height, fusion rate, incidence of subsidence, dysphagia, and adjacent segment degeneration were analyzed with the RevMan 5.3.3 software.
   RESULTS: A total of 15 studies were included. There was no difference regarding preoperative or postoperative Japanese Orthopedic Association score, Neck Disability Index, segmental Cobb angle and intervertebral height, preoperative cervical Cobb angle, fusion rate, incidence of subsidence, and adjacent segment degeneration between the SSC and CP group (P > 0.05). However, the SSC group had shorter operative time (mean difference [MD], -11.35; 95% confidence interval [CI], -16.24 to -3.66) and hospital stay (MD, -0.64; 95% CI, -1.21 to -0.06), less intraoperative blood loss (MD, -13.22; 95% CI, -19.03 to -7.41) and postoperative cervical Cobb angle (MD, -0.70; 95% CI, -1.35 to -0.06), and lower incidence of dysphagia significantly (odds ratio, -0.57; 95% CI, 0.40-0.82) (P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: ACDF with SSC and CP in multilevel cervical spondylosis achieved similar clinical relief. Although CP maintained better cervical lordosis, SSC contributed to less surgical pain and fewer complications. ACDF with SSC is safe and efficient in treating multilevel cervical spondylosis.

TI Predictive Accuracy of Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio on Long-Term
   Outcome in Patients with Spontaneous Intracerebral Hemorrhage

LA English
DT Article
DE Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio; Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage
ID MORTALITY; COUNT; BRAIN
AB BACKGROUND: It is well established that inflammation plays a critical role in the progression of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Recently the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was identified as a predictor for the short-term outcome in ICH patients. However, the association of NLR with the long-term outcome in patients with ICH remains unknown. Here, we aimed to assess the relationship between NLR and the long-term prognosis in ICH patients.
   METHODS: All patients with spontaneous ICH who were hospitalized at West China Hospital of Sichuan University from October 2013 to May 2017 were retrospectively enrolled. White blood count, absolute count of neutrophils, and lymphocytes were extracted from electronic medical records, and NLR was calculated according to admission neutrophil count (ANC) and lymphocyte count (ALC). The associations between long-term outcomes and laboratory biomarkers were estimated by multivariable logistic regression analysis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were also determined to compare the predictive powers between each inflammatory factor.
   RESULTS: A total of 481 ICH patients were included in the study. Of those, 204 presented with unfavorable outcomes, and 142 were dead within 6 months. Age, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores, WBC, ANC, NLR, hematoma size, and hydrocephalus were independently associated with poor prognosis of ICH. Multiple linear analysis showed GCS, hematoma volume, WBC, ANC, and ALC to be correlated with NLR. Moreover, in comparison with other single laboratory determinations, NLR also showed better predictive capacity for long-term mortality and morbidity, for which the best predictive cutoff values were 9.07 and 8.69, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: NLR independently predicts 180-day morbidity and 180-day mortality in patients with spontaneous ICH.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of microsurgical clipping and endovascular embolization for the treatment of middle cerebral artery aneurysm (MCAA).
   MATERIAL AND METHODS: The clinical data of 482 patients with MCAA treated with microsurgical clipping or endovascular embolization were analyzed retrospectively. According to whether the aneurysms were ruptured, patients were divided into a ruptured group and an unruptured group. Demographics, clinical manifestation, and postoperative complications were recorded.
   RESULTS: In the microsurgical clipping group (257 patients), there were 114 male and 143 female patients. The mean age was (55 +/- 10) years and the mean course of disease was 3 (1, 36) days. The total numbers of MCAA were 274, including 179 ruptured aneurysms and 95 unruptured aneurysms. In the endovascular embolization group (225 patients), there were 98 male and 127 female patients. The mean age was (54 +/- 11) years and the mean course of disease was 10 (1, 55) days. The total numbers of MCAA were 234, including 126 ruptured aneurysms and 108 unruptured aneurysms. There was no difference between the incidence of complications in the ruptured and unruptured groups. The outcome of the endovascular embolization group was better than the microsurgical clipping group in ruptured aneurysms (P = 0.000). The recurrence rate of the endovascular embolization group was greater than the microsurgical clipping group in ruptured aneurysms (P = 0.023).
   CONCLUSIONS: Both microsurgical clipping and endovascular embolization were safe and effective methods for the treatment of MCAA, but patients with ruptured MCAAs treated with endovascular embolization were more likely to experience recurrence.

AB OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical accuracy and perioperative outcomes for pedicle screw placement in transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) between the robot-assisted (RA) technique and fluoroscopy-guided (FG) technique.
   METHODS: Seventy-seven patients scheduled to undergo RA (n = 43) and FG (n = 44) TLIF surgery were included. Patient demographics, radiographic accuracy, and perioperative outcomes were recorded and compared. The accuracy of pedicle screw placement was according to the Gertzbein and Robbins scale and facet joint violation. Perioperative outcomes mainly included operative time, radiation exposure, and revisions.
   RESULTS: Of the 176 screws in the RA group, 164 screws were grade A, and 9, 2, and 1 screws were grades B, C, and D, respectively. Of the 204 screws in the FG group, 175 screws were grade A, with 16 screws scored as grade B, 8 screws scored as grade C, 3 screws scored as grade D, and 2 screws scored as grade E. The rate of perfect screw position (grade A) was higher in the RA group than in the FG group (93.2% vs. 85.8%, respectively; P = 0.020). In the FG group, 191 screws (93.6%) were clinically acceptable (groups A and B), whereas more acceptable screw positions were achieved in the RA group (98.3%; P = 0.024). Fewer screws in the RA group violated the proximal facet joint (5 vs. 24 screws, respectively; P = 0.001). The radiation dose was lower in the RA group (25.9 +/- 14.2 vs. 70.5 +/- 27.3 mSv, respectively; P < 0.001). Two screws in the FG group required a revision, but no revision was required in the RA group.
   CONCLUSIONS: RA pedicle screw placement is an accurate and safe procedure in TLIF for lumbar degenerative disease.

ID CEREBELLOPONTINE ANGLE; MICROVASCULAR DECOMPRESSION; CYST
AB BACKGROUND: Hemifacial spasm (HFS) is generally caused by the root exit zone of the facial nerve compressed by an overlying arterial loop. HFS can also be caused by various types of tumor, aneurysm, or arteriovenous malformation. We retrospectively analyzed patients to evaluate possible differences in the demographic and clinical features between primary and secondary HFS.
   METHODS: A retrospective study of 3140 cases of HFS treated in our department between January 2009 and June 2016. Among the 3140 total cases, 26 patients had secondary HFS.
   RESULTS: The 26 tumors of secondary HFS included 11 meningiomas, 8 epidermoid cysts, and 7 vestibular schwannomas. Compared to those with idiopathic HFS, those patients with tumor-induced HFS were significantly younger (P < 0.05). Secondary HFS tended to have responsible vessels, and were observed in 20 (76.92%) of these 26 patients. The long-term effective rate of operation was 84% in the secondary HFS group and was 96.45% in the primary HFS group (P < 0.05); the incidence rate of complication was 12% in the secondary HFS group and was 3.06% in the primary HFS group (P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: In cases of secondary HFS, facial nerves of most patients were compressed by blood vessels, so microvascular decompression after tumor resection plays an important role. We should examine the entire nerve root for possible vascular compression.

AB OBJECTIVE: To explore predictors of epilepsy presentation in unruptured brain arteriovenous malformations (bAVMs) with quantitative evaluation of location and radiomics features on T2-weighted imaging.
   METHODS: This retrospective study identified 117 patients with unruptured bAVMs. Cases were randomly split into training dataset (n = 90) and test dataset (n = 27). On the training dataset, we applied atlas-based analysis to identify epilepsy-susceptible brain regions of bAVMs, and then applied the radiomics technique to explore shape, intensity, and textural features that were correlated with epilepsy presentation. Informative radiomics predictors were selected by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator with 3-fold cross-validation. A linear classification score was then constructed, and we tested if we could precisely identify epilepsy-susceptible bAVMs with the location and radiomics predictors.
   RESULTS: Two brain regions and 4 radiomics features were screened out as predictors for epilepsy. The percent of damage of the right precentral gyrus and the right superior longitudinal fasciculus was associated with epilepsy presentation. The 4 radiomics features were Original_firstorder_Median, Wavelet-LHL_firstorder_InterquartileRange, Wavelet-HHL_firstorder_InterquartileRange, and Wavelet-HHH_glrlm_RunVariance. Epileptogenic bAVMs had larger variance of run lengths, larger median value, and interquartile range of voxel intensities. On the training dataset, these 6 predictors were able to classify epilepsy-susceptible bAVMs with accuracy at 0.822, and the area under the curve was 0.866 (95% confidence interval, 0.791-0.940). On the test dataset, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of classification reached 0.786, 0.769, and 0.778, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: Epilepsy-susceptible bAVMs had distinct locations and radiomics features on T2-weighted imaging.

AB OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the usefulness of conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in stratification of spinal cord non-ependymal gliomas.
   METHODS: Forty-one patients (mean age, 29.9 +/- 16.8 years; 27 men) with first-diagnosed spinal cord non-ependymal gliomas underwent conventional MRI including T1-weighted, T2-weighted (T2W) and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging sequences. The tumors were removed by surgery and processed by histology 1 week after MRI. Patients were divided into low-grade and high-grade groups according to histological findings. The MRI features of gliomas including signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR), margins, heterogeneity, edema, enhancement, tumor size, longitudinal location, and presence of syrinx were measured and compared between low-grade and high-grade groups using the chi(2) test and the Mann-Whitney U test.
   RESULTS: The SNR of low-grade gliomas on T2W images was significantly higher than that of high-grade gliomas (165.0 +/- 108.7 vs. 98.6 +/- 44.4; P = 0.016 by the Mann-Whitney U test). The margins of low-grade gliomas were found to be clearer compared to that of high-grade gliomas (54.5% vs. 5.3%; P = 0.001). Receiver-operating-characteristic analysis revealed that the area under the curve of 1/SNR, margin and the combination of 1/SNR and margin was 0.722 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.564-0.880), 0.736 (95% CI, 0.578-0.894), and 0.845 (95% CI, 0.717-0.973), respectively. No significant differences were found in the heterogeneity, edema, enhancement level, enhancement SNR, size, longitudinal location, cyst, hemorrhage, and intramedullary location between low-grade and high-grade non-ependymal gliomas (all P > 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: The characteristics of signal intensity and margin on T2W imaging are valuable in stratification of spinal cord non-ependymal gliomas.

AB OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the imaging characteristics of fenestrated anterior communicating artery (AcomA) aneurysm and clinical outcome of patients with fenestrated AcomA aneurysm.
   METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of consecutive patients with AcomA aneurysms between January 2013 and December 2017. According to the vascular variations of the AcomA, the patients were divided into 2 groups: fenestrated AcomA aneurysms and non-fenestrated AcomA aneurysms. Baseline characteristics, clinical complications, and outcomes of patients were analyzed.
   RESULTS: A total of 217 patients with AcomA aneurysms were included in this study. Compared to non-fenestrated AcomA aneurysms, the size of fenestrated AcomA aneurysms was significantly smaller (P < 0.001). Moreover, the patients with fenestrated AcomA aneurysms had a higher rate of rebleeding (P = 0.036), hydrocephalus (P = 0.017), delayed cerebral ischemia (P = 0.021), and pulmonary infection (P = 0.017) than those with non-fenestrated AcomA aneurysms. According to the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) at follow-up, the patients with fenestrated AcomA aneurysms had a higher rate of disability (P = 0.035) (GOS 2-3) and mortality (P = 0.013) (GOS 1).
   CONCLUSIONS: Fenestrated AcomA aneurysms are associated with higher clinical complications, and identification of AcomA fenestration contributes to successful clipping of AcomA aneurysms.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the incidence and risk factors associated with proximal junctional kyphosis (PJK) in patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) after correction surgery.
   METHODS: PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library were searched from inception until August 2018 to obtain relevant studies. After study selection and data extraction, statistical analysis was performed with RevMan 5.3. The odds ratios (ORs) and weight mean differences (WMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for all available factors were analyzed using fixed or random effects models.
   RESULTS: A total of 7 studies were included in this meta-analysis. The overall incidence of PJK in AIS was 14% (95% CI, 8%-20%). Among the potential risk factors, proximal implants with screws (OR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.13-2.39; P = 0.010), instrumentation types with all screws (OR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.19-2.67; P = 0.005), larger preoperative thoracic kyphosis (TK) (WMD, 7.50; 95% CI, 5.75-9.26; P < 0.001), larger preoperative lumbar lordosis (LL) (WMD, 4.85; 95% CI, 2.79-6.92; P < 0.001), larger postoperative LL (WMD, 2.00; 95% CI, 0.09-3.91; P = 0.040), greater change in TK (WMD, -6.75; 95% CI, -9.72 to -3.78; P < 0.001), and greater change in LL (WMD, -3.26; 95% CI, -5.40 to -1.12; P = 0.003) were identified as risk factors for PJK.
   CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of PJK in patients with AIS was 14%. Proximal implants with screws and instrumentation types with all screws were significantly associated with increased occurrence of PJK. Larger preoperative TK, larger preoperative LL, larger postoperative LL, greater TK change, and greater LL change were also identified as risk factors for PJK in AIS after correction surgery.

AB OBJECTIVE/BACKGROUND: The natural history and the outlook of patients with hydrocephalus are dramatically affected using cerebrospinal fluid shunts. The several issues related with a long-standing shunt should suffice to justify all the possible attempts to free the patient from it. This study focused on the role of secondary endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) in the achievement of shunt removal in cases of shunt malfunction, and to identify patients who could benefit most from the procedure.
   METHODS: In the period of 2006-2015, ETV was attempted in 47 patients >6 months old with ventriculoperitoneal shunt malfunction who presented with increased ventricle size compared with the previous neuroradiological examinations; simultaneously the shunt was removed or ligated.
   RESULTS: The overall success rate of secondary ETV was 74% (shunt-free patients with normalized intracranial pressure and absence of symptoms attributable to hydrocephalus) in patients with a long shunt duration (up to 30 years). The number of previous shunt revision procedures (P = 0.026) and lower age (P = 0.017) correlate with the likelihood of secondary ETV failure, a score of 80 as ETV success score (calculated for both pediatric and adult patients, even if the score was meant for the pediatric population) correlates with secondary ETV success (P = 0.014).
   CONCLUSIONS: Many patients with shunt malfunction can benefit from secondary ETV even after decades of shunting. Age at secondary ETV, the number of previous shunt revisions, and the ETV success score can help to better identify the best candidates for the procedure.

AB Background: Two leading hypotheses for restless legs syndrome (RLS) pathophysiology are dopaminergic dysfunction and sympathetic overactivity. Ocular changes occur with both dopaminergic and sympathetic pathologies, and thus may provide unique insights into the pathophysiology of RLS.
   Methods: Thirty-five patients with RLS and 35 healthy individuals were enrolled in the study. Peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), macular, and choroidal thicknesses were measured by optical coherence tomography (OCT).
   Results: There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups regarding RNFL and macular thicknesses. The subfoveal, temporal and nasal choroidal thicknesses were significantly thinner in patients with RLS compared with normal subjects (p < 0.05).
   Conclusion: Thinning of the choroid is linked to sympathetic overactivity. Our results provide further evidence for sympathetic overactivity in the pathogenesis of RLS. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID SLEEP EEG; RELIABILITY; VARIABILITY
AB Objective: To assess the validity of an automatic EEG arousal detection algorithm using large patient samples and different heterogeneous databases.
   Methods: Automatic scorings were confronted with results from human expert scorers on a total of 2768 full-night PSG recordings obtained from two different databases. Of them, 472 recordings were obtained during a clinical routine at our sleep center and were subdivided into two subgroups of 220 (HMC-S) and 252 (HMC-M) recordings each, according to the procedure followed by the clinical expert during the visual review (semi-automatic or purely manual, respectively). In addition, 2296 recordings from the public SHHS-2 database were evaluated against the respective manual expert scorings.
   Results: Event-by-event epoch-based validation resulted in an overall Cohen's kappa agreement of kappa = 0.600 (HMC-S), 0.559 (HMC-M), and 0.573 (SHHS2). Estimated inter-scorer variability on the datasets was, respectively, kappa = 0.594, 0.561 and 0.543. Analyses of the corresponding Arousal Index scores showed associated automatic-human repeatability indices ranges of 0.693-0.771 (HMC-S), 0.646-0.791 (HMCM), and 0.759-0.791 (SHHS2).
   Conclusions: Large-scale validation of our automatic EEG arousal detector on different databases has shown robust performance and good generalization results comparable to the expected levels of human agreement. Special emphasis was put on reproducibility of the results; implementation of our method has been made available online as open source code. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: A close relationship between obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been described in recent years. OSA is a risk factor for AD, but the diagnosis and clinical characteristics of OSA in patients with AD is not well understood. This study evaluated the clinical utility of two screening questionnaires, the STOP-Bang questionnaire (SBQ) and the Berlin questionnaire (BQ), to identify which patients with mild AD are at higher risk of having OSA and to determine the clinical predictors of OSA in this population.
   Methods: In this study, 91 consecutive outpatients with mild AD were prospectively evaluated with the SBQ and the BQ. All patients underwent level 1 in-laboratory polysomnography. The predictive performance of the questionnaires were calculated for different apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI) cut-offs.
   Results: The median age of the patients was 76.0 (73.0; 80.0) years, and 58 (63.7%) were female. Of those, 81 patients (89.02%) were found to have OSA defined by an AHI > 5 events/h. Comparing the predictive performances of the SBQ and the BQ, the SBQ was found to have a higher diagnostic sensitivity (85% vs 4%), a lower specificity (35% vs. 96%), a higher positive predictive value (PPV) (44% vs 33%) and negative predictive value (NPV) (80% vs 65%) for detecting severe OSA at an AHI cut-off of 30 events/h. None of the items alone in the two questionnaires predicted the risk of OSA. A modified version of the SBQ, with new cut-off points for several variables according to the characteristics of AD patients, showed a slightly greater AUC than the standard SBQ (AUC 0.61 vs 0.72).
   Conclusion: There is a high prevalence of OSA among patients with mild AD. The SBQ and the BQ are not good screening tools for detecting OSA in patients with AD. A modified version of SBQ could increase the detection of these patients. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI The association between migraine and restless legs syndrome: an updated

LA English
DT Review
DE Migraine; Restless legs syndrome; Meta-analysis
ID PREVALENCE; COMORBIDITY; AURA; RLS
AB Objective: This study aims to gain further insight into the association between migraine and restless legs syndrome (RLS).
   Methods: A literature search of PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science was performed for studies investigating the association between any migraine and RLS; a meta-analysis of eligible studies was conducted to determine a pooled effect estimate for the association.
   Results: Fifteen studies were included in this meta-analysis. The studies differed in methodology, but all investigated the association between migraine and RLS. Pooled RLS prevalence was 17.0% [95% confidence interval (CI) 15.0%-20.0%] among migraineurs, and 7.0% (95% CI 5.0%-8.0%) among no migraine individuals. Pooled analyses showed that migraine was associated with RLS, but effect estimates were substantially higher in case-control studies [pooled odds ratio (OR) = 3.77, 95% CI 2.73-5.21; I-2 = 50.1%] than in cross-sectional studies (pooled OR - 1.25, 95% CI 1.11-1.41; I-2 = 34.2%). Subgroup analyses were not conducted to find potential factors that affect this association because of too few available studies.
   Conclusions: This updated meta-analysis confirms the association between migraine and RLS. Future studies should specifically investigate the potential effects of gender, age, aura status, and type (episodic or chronic) of migraine on the association between the two disorders.

AB Aim: To test the association between cardiometabolic risk factors and subjective sleep quality assessed by the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), independent of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and sleep duration.
   Methods: A total of 573 participants from the Baependi Heart Study, a rural cohort from Brazil, completed sleep questionnaires and underwent polygraphy for OSA evaluation. Multivariable linear regression analysis tested the association between cardiovascular risk factors (outcome variables) and sleep quality measured by PSQI, adjusting for OSA and other potential confounders (age, sex, race, salary/wage, education, marital status, alcohol intake, obesity, smoking, hypertension, and sleep duration).
   Results: The sample mean age was 43 +/- 16 years, 66% were female, and mean body mass index (BMI) was 26 +/- 5 kg/m(2). Only 20% were classified as obese (BMI >= 30). Overall, 50% of participants reported poor sleep quality as defined by a PSQI score >= 5. A high PSQI score was significantly associated with higher very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol levels (beta = 0.392, p = 0.012) and higher triglyceride levels (beta = 0.017, p = 0.006), even after adjustments, including the apneaehypopnea index. Further adjustments accounting for marital status, alcohol intake, and medication use did not change these findings. No significant association was observed between PSQI scores and glucose or blood pressure. According to PSQI components, sleep disturbances (beta = 1.976, p = 0.027), sleep medication use (beta = 1.121, p = 0.019), and daytime dysfunction (beta = 1.290, p = 0.024) were significantly associated with higher VLDL serum levels. Only the daytime dysfunction domain of the PSQI components was significantly associated with higher triglyceride levels (beta = 0.066, p = 0.004).
   Conclusion: Poorer lipid profile was independently associated with poor sleep quality, assessed by the PSQI questionnaire, regardless of a normal sleep duration and accounting for OSA and socio-economic status. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Study objectives: Overnight fluid shift from the legs into the neck may contribute to the pathogenesis of snoring and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The present study investigates the effects of calf muscle electrical stimulation (ES) on reducing leg fluid accumulation while seated, subsequent rostral fluid shift on lying down, and the impact on snoring and OSA.
   Methods: Sixteen non-obese, normotensive men with OSA participated in the study. On the first study day, participants sat for 150 min receiving either active or sham ES through random allocation, then lied supine for 60 min. While seated and supine, leg and neck fluid volumes were measured using bioelectrical impedance to determine the magnitude of fluid shift. On the night of the study day, participants wore a portable sleep apnea diagnostic device overnight to measure snoring and sleep apnea severity. One week later, participants crossed over to the other study condition.
   Results: Active calf muscle ES reduced leg fluid accumulation by 46% while seated. Upon lying supine, active ES reduced fluid shift out of the legs by 17% and reduced neck fluid accumulation by 31%. This led to a 15% reduction in snoring index, but did not alleviate OSA.
   Conclusions: One session of calf muscle ES was effective at reducing leg fluid accumulation and rostral fluid shift, which led to a modest reduction in the snoring index, but not OSA. Despite this lack of effect of calf muscle ES in attenuating OSA severity, the reduction in the snoring index suggests that it did have an effect, albeit mild, on upper-airway mechanics.

AB Background: In recent years, short sleep has been increasingly recognized as a risk factor for obesity. However, current evidence has so far been limited to cross-sectional studies or longitudinal studies using self-reported sleep. Therefore, we explored the directionality of the association between objectively measured sleep and body mass index (BMI).
   Methods: The study consists of 1031 participants from the general population (52% women, 45-91 years at baseline). Sleep, BMI and waist circumference (WC) were measured twice across a follow-up of six years. BMI and WC were measured at the research center. Total sleep time (TST, hrs), sleep onset latency (SOL, min), sleep efficiency (SE, %) and wake after sleep onset (WASO, min) were estimated by a wrist-worn actigraph. In addition, cross-sectional and longitudinal associations in both directions were explored.
   Results: An hour shorter TST was cross-sectionally associated with approximately 0.5 kg/m(2) higher BMI. Longitudinally, longer TST and higher SE were associated with lower BMI (beta(TST) = -0.75, 95% CI: -1.08, -0.42; beta(SE) = -0.04, 95% CI: -0.08, -0.01). Conversely, one kg/m(2) higher BMI was prospectively associated with 0.02 h shorter TST (95% CI: -0.03, -0.01), and this association was more pronounced over time. Results from analyses with WC were in line with those of BMI.
   Conclusions: This is the first study to explore bidirectionality in the association between objectively measured sleep and BMI in a large population of middle-aged and older adults. Indices of poor sleep were associated with higher and less stable BMI across time. Conversely, a high BMI was associated with a decrease in sleep duration. This confirms that the relation between sleep and body size is bidirectional, and changes in either sleep or BMI are likely to co-occur with changes in health through multiple pathways.

AB Objective: This study examined the associations between four types of screen-based activities and depressive symptoms among adolescents. We further investigated whether sleep characteristics (ie, insomnia symptoms and sleep duration) mediate these associations.
   Methods: Data come from 2865 U.S. adolescents (mean age = 15.53, SD = 0.73, 51.8% male) in the age 15 follow-up of the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study. Adolescents completed surveys regarding sleep duration and insomnia symptoms, typical daily duration of four screen activities (social messaging, web surfing, TV/movie watching, and gaming), and depressive symptoms. We constructed a multiple mediation model to elucidate the associations between age 15 screen time, sleep and depressive symptoms, while adjusting for age 9 depressive symptoms.
   Results: Structural Equation Modeling analyses revealed that the association between screen time and depressive symptoms is partially or fully mediated by sleep. For social messaging, web surfing and TV/movie watching, the three sleep variables fully mediated the positive association between screen time and depressive symptoms. For gaming, the three sleep variables acted as partial mediators in the model, accounting for 38.5% of the association between gaming and depressive symptoms.
   Conclusions: Our results highlight both screen-based activities and sleep behaviors as potential intervention targets to reduce depressive symptoms among adolescents. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: To assess the effects of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment on brain structure and function in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).
   Methods: A prospective study of seven OSA patients recruited from the sleep center at our institution was carried out. Patients were treated with six weeks of CPAP treatment. Pre-treatment and post-treatment magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) perfusion scans were obtained and compared to assess for treatment-induced changes. Microstructural changes were quantified using functional anistrophy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD), and brain perfusion was quantified using cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral blood volume (CBV).
   Results: Of the seven patients included the in study, six (85.7%) were male, and the mean age was 51 years (standard deviation = 13.14). Increased FA and decreased MD were found in the hippocampus, temporal lobes, fusiform gyrus, and occipital lobes. Decreased FA and increased MD were found in frontal regions for all patients (p < 0.05). Increased CBF and CBV were also observed following treatment (p < 0.05).
   Conclusion: In addition to symptom resolution, CPAP treatment may allow for healing of OSA-induced brain damage as seen by restoration of brain structure and perfusion. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

ID PRIMARY INSOMNIA; PERCEPTION; INTERMITTENT; PERIOD
AB Study objective: To study sleep EEG characteristics associated with misperception of Sleep Onset Latency (SOL).
   Methods: Data analysis was based on secondary analysis of standard in-lab polysomnographic recordings in 20 elderly people with insomnia and 21 elderly good sleepers. Parameters indicating sleep fragmentation, such as number of awakenings, wake after sleep onset (WASO) and percentage of NREM1 were extracted from the polsysomnogram, as well as spectral power, microarousals and sleep spindle index. The correlation between these parameters during the first sleep cycle and the amount of misperceived sleep was assessed in the insomnia group. Additionally, we made a model of the minimum duration that a sleep fragment at sleep onset should have in order to be perceived as sleep, and we fitted this model to subjective SOLs of both subject groups.
   Results: Misperception of SOL was associated with increased percentage of NREM1 and more WASO during sleep cycle 1. For insomnia subjects, the best fit of modelled SOL with subjective SOL was found when assuming that sleep fragments shorter than 30 min at sleep onset were perceived as wake. The model indicated that healthy subjects are less sensitive to sleep interruptions and perceive fragments of 10 min or longer as sleep.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that sleep onset misperception is related to sleep fragmentation at the beginning of the night. Moreover, we show that people with insomnia needed a longer duration of continuous sleep for the perception as such compared to controls. Further expanding the model could provide more detailed information about the underlying mechanisms of sleep misperception. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: The present study investigated sleep duration and sleep timing from infancy to early adulthood.
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey study of N = 18,323 participants (9004 female) from 0 to 25 years (M = 12.36; SD = 5.76) from kindergartens, schools and universities in SW Germany. Participants reported their usual bedtimes and rise times on weekdays/weekends. Time in bed (TIB), the midpoint of sleep, and social jetlag were calculated from these four clock times.
   Results: Weekday rise times were progressively earlier until the age of 17 years, while weekend rise times contrarily were later. As a consequence, TIB during the week was progressively shorter until the age of 16 years. The midpoint of sleep (MSFsc) was increasingly later until it reached a plateau at 17 years. Social jetlag increased until 16 years to 3: 18 h. Gender differences were small for sleep duration/chronotype with males sleeping less and later than girls and non-significant for social jetlag. A regression with two breakpoints explained variability in sleep duration and sleep timing by age (45-61% explained variance) better than a regression with one breakpoint (44-59%), linear regression (25-54%) or polynomial regression (43-60%).
   Conclusions: The age around 16-17 years can be considered a remarkable breakpoint when sleep behavior significantly changes back towards slightly longer sleep, less socially jetlagged behavior, and the increase in eveningness is then stopped but not reversed. A somewhat softer breakpoint is identified around 5-7 years when the rapid changes in sleep behavior initiate. (c) 2019 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

TI Characterizing pediatric inpatient sleep duration and disruptions
SO SLEEP MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
DE Sleep; Pediatrics; Hospital
ID CHILDREN; APNEA; METHODOLOGY; PATTERNS; RISK
AB Objective: To contextualize inpatient sleep duration and disruptions in a general pediatric hospital ward by comparing in-hospital and at-home sleep durations to recommended guidelines and to objectively measure nighttime room entries.
   Methods: Caregivers of patients four weeks e 18 years of age reported patient sleep duration and disruptions in anonymous surveys. Average at-home and in-hospital sleep durations were compared to National Sleep Foundation recommendations. Objective nighttime traffic was evaluated as the average number of room entries between 11: 00 pm and 7: 00am using GOJO brand hand-hygiene room entry data.
   Results: Among 246 patients, patients slept less in the hospital than at home with newborn and infant cohorts experiencing 7-and 4-h sleep deficits respectively (Newborn: 787 +/- 318 min at home vs. 354 +/- 211 min in hospital, p < 0.001; Infants: 703 +/- 203 min at home vs. 412 +/- 152 min in hospital, p < 0.01). Newborn children also experienced > 2 h sleep deficits at home when compared to NSF recommendations (Newborns: 787 +/- 318 min at home vs. 930 min recommended, p < 0.05). Objective nighttime traffic measures revealed that hospitalized children experienced 7.3 room entries/night (7.3 +/- 0.25 entries). Nighttime traffic was significantly correlated with caregiver-reported nighttime awakenings (Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient: 0.83, p < 0.001).
   Conclusion: Hospitalization is a missed opportunity to improve sleep both in the hospital and at home. (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: It is now recognized that the vast majority of individuals with typical RBD will develop a synucleinopathy; usually 11-16 years after symptom onset. Parasomnia Overlap Disorder (POD) with adolescent-onset dream enactment behavior with phenoconversion to neurodegenerative disease after a long latency has not been previously described.
   Patient: We present a case of a 65-year-old man with presumptive POD who had co-morbid childhood onset sleep walking and adolescent-onset dream enactment behavior beginning at age 17, with subsequent evolution to an increasingly troublesome REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) at age 64 with Parkinson's Disease (PD) developing a year later.
   Results: Polysomnography performed at age 64 was consistent with a diagnosis of RBD. Dream enactment behavior preceded PD diagnosis by at least 48 years. Our case represents the youngest reported RBD case who developed PD.
   Conclusions: We report the first case of adolescent onset, presumed RBD in the context of presumptive POD developing neurodegenerative disease. Adolescent-onset RBD may have similar prognostic implications as typical RBD, where future phenoconversion to a synucleinopathy is expected. (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a highly prevalent sleep disorder associated with obesity, hypertension and metabolic syndrome. People with low socioeconomic status (SES) who are socially disadvantaged (eg, people belonging to an ethnic minority) have worse health outcomes. Thus, consequently, social inequality may potentially be a risk factor for OSA. This systematic review aims to summarize previous studies from the literature which investigate the association between SES, race/ethnicity and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).
   This review was performed in accordance with the PRISMA statement. A literature search in Medline, PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Web of Science was conducted. Articles published in English, Spanish, French, Italian and Portuguese, without publication date limits, and that aimed to analyze the association between OSA diagnosis and social disadvantage, were selected.
   In sum, 17 articles met the inclusion criteria. One was a longitudinal study, and the remainder were cross-sectional research. Low SES was indicated as a risk factor for the presence of OSA in most of the articles. Concerning racial/ethnic groups, a clear association with OSA does not emerge, since, in a few articles, the relation disappeared after controlling for variables such as obesity, comorbidities, and SES; suggesting that there may be differences only in OSA severity and sleep apnea phenotypes.
   The results of this systematic review point out that low SES could be a risk factor for OSA. Obesity, SES and disparities in health care could mediate the association between OSA and racial/ethnic minorities.

TI Advances in screening for undiagnosed atrial fibrillation for stroke

AB Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common type of sustained cardiac arrhythmia encountered in clinical practice, and its burden is expected to increase in most developed countries over the next few decades. Because AF can be silent, it is often not diagnosed until an AF-related complication occurs, such as stroke. AF is also associated with increased risk of heart failure, lower quality of life, and death. Anticoagulation has been shown to dramatically decrease embolic risk in the setting of atrial fibrillation, resulting in growing interest in early detection of previously undiagnosed AF. Newly developed monitoring devices have improved the detection of AF and have been recommended in guidelines for screening of AF in individuals aged 65 years and over. While screening is currently targeted to these older individuals, younger patients with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) are at higher risk of AF and stroke than the general population, indicating a need for targeted early detection of AF in this group. Compared to individuals without OSA, those with OSA are four times more likely to develop AF, and the risk of AF is strongly associated with OSA severity. The overall prevalence of AF among individuals with OSA remains unknown because of limitations related to study design and to the conventional methods previously used for AF detection. Recent and emerging technological advances may improve the detection of undiagnosed AF in high-risk population groups, such as those with OSA. In this clinical review, we discuss the methods of screening for AF and the applications of newer technologies for AF detection in patients with OSA. We conclude the review with a brief description of our research agenda in this area. (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are disorders with virtually unknown etiologies. Several studies suggest that these disorders are comorbid. However, previous findings may have been influenced by study participants undergoing medical treatments. Thus, the association between RLS and ADHD needs to be investigated in a large population of individuals, not in continuous medical treatment.
   Materials and methods: This was a cross-sectional study of 25,336 participants enrolled in the Danish Blood Donor Study from May 1, 2015, to February 1, 2017. Study participants completed the Cambridge eHopkins RLS questionnaire, reported experience of involuntary leg movements during sleep (ILMS), completed the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale v. 1.1 (ASRS), and provided information on sex, age, body mass index, smoking status, alcohol consumption, whole blood donation history, and self-appraised quality of sleep. Associations between RLS and ADHD symptoms, including subtypes, were examined using multivariate linear-and logistic regression analyses.
   Results: Of the 25,336 participants with complete data, 1,322 (5.2%) were classified with RLS, and 653 (2.6%) experienced ADHD symptoms. RLS sufferers were more prone to classify with ADHD according to the full ASRS (OR = 3.57, 95% CI: 3.14-4.0), and they were also more likely to experience ADHD-subtype symptoms (inattention, OR = 1.66, 95% CI: 1.43-1.90; hyperactivity-impulsivity, OR = 1.90, 95% CI: 1.66 -2.14). Finally, RLS sufferers with ILMS had increased odds for ADHD symptoms compared with RLS sufferers without (OR = 2.15, 95% CI: 1.30-3.55). This was also observed for the hyperactivityimpulsivity subtype (OR = 5.57, 95% CI: 2.14-14.5).
   Conclusions: RLS and ADHD are associated and may be comorbid disorders. (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose: The aim of this study was to clinically characterize sleep disorders in a cohort of Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) patients, correlating these findings with disease features and polysomnographic (PSG) results.
   Methods: We evaluated eight consecutive patients with molecular confirmation of NPC followed at the Hospital Geral de Fortaleza. Patients underwent a comprehensive neurological and sleep evaluation. Four participants underwent polysomnography and then performed the multiple sleep latency test.
   Results: All eight patients evaluated had sleep disorders. Four participants performed polysomnography followed by multiple sleep latency test. Chronic insomnia and Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) were the most frequent sleep disorders (62,5%). Two patients were diagnosed with Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) (25%) and two with probable REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) (25%). All the patients who did polysomnography had reduced and/or disorganized sleep, with reduction on sleep efficiency, total sleep time and REM sleep time.
   Conclusion: Our results suggest that sleep abnormalities in Niemann-Pick type C patients may be more prevalent than previously thought. (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To investigate the association between self-reported daytime napping habits and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in a large community-based study population.
   Methods: Of the 4170 participants, 55.5% were women and the mean age was 63.1 years (SD, 11.0 years). CVD included cardiovascular death, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, stroke, angina, and revascularization and was defined as the first confirmed incidence of CVD during an average 11-year follow-up. Self-reported daytime napping habits were recorded using baseline questionnaires. Backward stepwise Cox regression analysis was used to explore the relationship between CVD and napping habits.
   Results: In this study, 914 participants with CVD (21.9%) were observed. Participants who took regular long naps had a higher prevalence of incident CVD than did those who took regular short naps, irregular naps, or no naps (34.5% vs. 28.4%, 22.4%, 16.6%, respectively; P < 0.001). In the final backward stepwise Cox regression model, regular long naps were found to be associated with CVD (HR: 1.403, 95% CI: 1.079 -1.825, P = 0.012).
   Conclusions: Regular long daytime napping was an independent risk factor for CVD. Healthy sleep habits may promote human health and prevent CVD. (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: The present cross-sectional study investigated the relationship between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D-3 (25[OH]D-3) levels and the presence of poor sleep quality in a community-based Japanese adult population.
   Methods: Poor sleep quality, defined as poor subjective sleep quality and/or use of sleep medications, was assessed using a self-administered questionnaire. The prevalence of poor sleep quality was compared among 512 Japanese participants aged 35-79 years, based on serum 25(OH) D-3 levels, which were determined using tandem mass spectrometry. A logistic regression model was used to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) for the presence of poor sleep quality in each group with the highest quartile of 25(OH) D-3 serving as the reference group.
   Results: Poor sleep quality was reported by 33.2% of the total study population. The prevalence of poor sleep quality was higher in the first quartile group (25[OH] D-3: 2.08-18.13 ng/mL) than in the second, third and fourth quartile groups (18.14-23.07 ng/mL, 23.08-28.32 ng/mL, and 28.33-78.83 ng/mL, respectively). The ORs for poor sleep quality were 1.86 (95% confidence interval, 1.08-3.20) for the first quartile group, 0.73 (0.41-1.29) for the second quartile group, and 0.73 (0.42-1.27) for the third quartile group after adjusting for age, sex, and sociodemographic, lifestyle, physical and environmental factors, while the ORs were 1.68 (0.96-2.95), 0.69 (0.39-1.24), and 0.65 (0.37-1.15) after further adjustment for overall health status and depression status.
   Conclusions: The first quartile group of serum 25(OH) D-3 was associated with the presence of poor sleep quality. (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Accumulated evidences indicates that sleep duration and sleep quality may potentially trigger the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), but no studies have explored this causality. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of sleep duration on the incidence of NAFLD in Korean middle-aged adults.
   Methods: All participants were selected from the cohort of the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study (KoGES) for a 10-year period. NAFLD was defined by Fatty Liver Index (FLI), NAFLD liver fat score (NLFS), Hepatic Steatosis Index (HSI) and Lipid Accumulation Product (LAP). Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to assess the relationship between sleep duration and NAFLD defined by NAFLD scores. ANCOVA and Spline curve was also used to verify the differences in means of NAFLD scores according to the four sleep duration groups.
   Results: In comparison with those of individuals in the reference group, the OR (95% CI) for NAFLD was 2.230 (1.304-3.813) for group of people who slept more than 8 h, 1.869 (1.298-2.691) for 7-8 h after adjusting for several confounding factors. The odds ratio for the incidence of NAFLD was 1.462 (1.029 -2.077) for the group of people who sleep more than 8 h, 1.271 (1.001-1.615) for 7-8 h after adjusting for age, sex, BMI, SBP, DBP, TG, HDL, FDG, smoking, physical activity, daytime napping and night-time shifting (p < 0.01).
   Conclusion: These findings indicate a relationship between long sleep duration and the elevation of NAFLD scores and support the causality of sleep duration and incidence of NAFLD in Korean middle-aged adults. (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose: Whether the association between hypnotic and increased mortality risk is created by causation or confounding, has been long debated. We further examined the possibility of confounding by indication with a comprehensive approach.
   Methods: The National FINRISK Study cohorts of 1997, 2002, and 2007 (25,436 participants aged 25-74) were followed up until July 2012. There were 1822 deaths, and at least one gender, baseline age and cohort matched 'control' was found for 1728 'cases' yielding a final analytical sample of 3955 individuals. An index age, equivalent to the age at death of their respective cases' was set for each control. Hypnotic drug purchases were followed from the Finnish nationwide register during a 36-month run-up period before the date of death/index date. The prevalence and incidence of hypnotic purchases were compared between cases and matched controls. Moreover, latent developmental trajectories of purchases were modelled and their relations with specific and all-cause death risks were analysed.
   Results: An increasing difference between cases and controls was observed as regards the use of hypnotic drugs. During the last 30 months before the date of death/index date, the rate ratio of incident purchases between cases and controls was 2.37 (95% CL, 1.79-3.12) among older and 3.61 (95% CL, 2.37-5.89) among younger individuals. The developmental trajectories of hypnotic drug purchases were differently and by interpretation plausibly associated with specific mortality risks.
   Conclusions: In most cases the association between hypnotics and mortality risk is created by symptomatic treatment when death is approaching. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Information about the natural history of nontuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease (NTM-PD) is limited. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term natural history of non-cavitary nodular bronchiectatic NTM-PD and the factors associated with treatment initiation and the frequency of spontaneous sputum culture conversion after diagnosis of NTM-PD.
   Methods: We evaluated 1,021 patients with newly diagnosed non-cavitary nodular bronchiectatic NTM-PD caused by Mycobacterium avium complex or M. abscessus between 2003 and 2013.
   Results: Of 1,021 patients, 562 (55%) initiated antibiotic treatment and 459 (45%) did not. Young age (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.98-0.99), low body mass index (aHR = 0.96; 95% CI = 0.93-0.99), previous history of tuberculosis (aHR = 1.23; 95% CI = 1.01-1.50), respiratory complaints such as cough (aHR = 1.36; 95% CI = 1.05-1.75) and sputum production (aHR = 1.47; 95% CI = 1.13-1.91), and high number of involved lobes on high-resolution computed tomography (aHR = 1.22; 95% CI = 1.14-1.31) were associated with treatment initiation. Of 459 patients who did not initiate treatment, 157 (34%) showed spontaneous sputum culture conversion. None of the clinical factors was associated with spontaneous conversion. After spontaneous culture conversion, 26 of 157 (17%) showed redeveloped NTM-PD caused by a species different from the original species.
   Conclusions: The natural history of non-cavitary nodular bronchiectatic NTM-PD is variable. After diagnosis, the decision to initiate antibiotic therapy should be individualized based on consideration of the risk factors for disease progression. However, for patients who do not start antibiotic therapy, continuous and lifetime follow-up is recommended to manage underlying bronchiectasis and the possibility of late progression of NTM-PD.

ID IRON-DEFICIENCY
AB Background: Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) may suffer from iron deficiency which is a known risk factor for the restless legs syndrome (RLS), however, its prevalence has not yet been investigated in these subjects.
   Patients and methods: Adult out-patients with CF (n=39) and healthy volunteers (n=32) were recruited for this study. A diagnosis of RLS was made based on the diagnostic criteria established by the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group (IRLSSG). The IRLSSG rating scale was used to assess the severity of the disease. Furthermore, in the CF group, parameters of iron metabolism were measured in peripheral venous blood samples.
   Results: The RLS occurred more frequently in the CF patients than the controls (n=13/33,3% vs. n=2/6,3%; p<0,05). In the CF patients suffering from RLS, the mean score of the IRLSSG rating scale was 17,2 +/- 9,4 indicating moderate disease severity. Iron deficiency was present in the majority of the CF patients investigated (n=33/84,6%), however, serum iron, ferritin and transferrin levels as well as transferrin saturation were similar in those with vs. without RLS.
   Conclusions: The frequency of the RLS is increased in adult patients with CF. On an average, its severity is moderate and it is not related to iron deficiency as evaluated by serum parameters of iron metabolism.

AB Background: Patients living with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) commonly present several limitations in their daily activities, high depression rates, and low quality of life, which makes this population a risk group for suicide. This study aims to systematically assess the literature on the association between CPOD and the likelihood of suicide.
   Methods: The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42018096618). The Latin-American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS), PubMed, SciELO, Scopus, LIVIVO, Web of Science, and PsychNET databases were used as primary study sources. OpenThesis and OpenGrey were used to partially capture the "grey literature". A manual search was also performed through a systematized analysis of the references of eligible articles. The risk of bias among the studies included was assessed with the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tools for Systematic Reviews. A random effects meta-analysis was performed to estimate the variation in odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).
   Results: The search provided 4762 results, from which only seven met the eligibility criteria and were ultimately included in the qualitative assessment of the review. The studies were published from 2002 to 2015. All studies presented low risk of bias. The total sample included 1390 suicide cases of COPD patients. The meta-analysis, which was based on five eligible case control studies, found that people with history of COPD are more likely to commit suicide (OR=1.90; 95% CI=1.27-2.48; p=0.002).
   Conclusion: COPD patients are 1.9 times more likely to commit suicide than people without COPD.

DT Article
DE Acid-fast smear; Mycobacterium kansasii; Prognosis; Pulmonary disease;
   Radiographic progression
AB Background: Aggressive therapy for Mycobacterium kansasii-pulmonary disease (MK-PD) is recommended because of the virulence of MK. However, some clinicians may be concerned regarding the lengthy course and numerous adverse effects. This study evaluated the natural course of MK-PD and investigated its prognostic factors.
   Methods: Radiographic outcome, prognostic factors, and mortality within 1 year for MK-PD were obtained from patients in 6 hospitals in Taiwan from 2010 to 2014 (derivation cohort) and validated using patients in 2015 and 2016 (validation cohort).
   Results: Of the 109 patients with MK-PD in the derivation cohort, radiographic progression occurred in 70 (64%), with a 1-year mortality rate of 43% and median survival of 71 days, whereas none of the 39 cases without radiographic progression died. All patients with acid-fast smear (AFS) grade >= 3 experienced radiographic progression. For the others, the independent risk factors of radiographic progression were fibroCavitary pattern, Leucocyte count>9000/mu L, Old age (age>65 years), pUre MK in sputum (no other mycobacteria), and no Diabetes mellitus (the CLOUD factors). By applying these criteria to the validation cohort (n=112), 3 (9%) of the 33 patients with MK-PD who initially had AFS grade < 3 and < 3 CLOUD risk factors experienced radiographic progression, and none of the 3 died of MK-PD.
   Conclusions: Because of the high risk of radiographic progression and subsequent fatal outcome, immediate anti-MK treatment is recommended. For patients with MK-PD who have sputum AFS grade < 3 and < 3 CLOUD risk factors, regular follow-up may be an alternative.

AB Background: Clinical trials of COPD pharmacotherapy typically involve aging populations with moderate-to-severe COPD, but the latter is often diagnosed by spirometric criteria that are not age-appropriate across the continuum of lung function. We have therefore re-evaluated the clinical effect of combination therapy (salmeterol plus fluticasone) in moderate-to-severe COPD, using more age-appropriate spirometric criteria from the Global Lung Function Initiative (GLI) and trial data from Towards a Revolution in COPD Health (TORCH).
   Methods: Of the 6112 TORCH participants, 5688 (93.1%) had GLI-based moderate-to-severe COPD (mean age 64.8 years). The primary outcome was all-cause mortality and the primary comparison was combination therapy vs. placebo. Secondary outcomes included COPD and cardiovascular (CV) mortality and pneumonia. A modified intention-to-treat analysis evaluated differences in time-to-event over a three-year period, using Cox proportional hazards models with statistical significance at p < 0.010 (acknowledging repeated significance testing).
   Results: Relative to placebo, combination therapy yielded a statistically non-significant reduction in all-cause mortality-adjusted hazard ratio [adjHR] 0.78 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.64, 0.95), p=0.012. Relative to placebo, combination therapy also yielded statistically non-significant reductions in COPD and CV mortality-adjHR 0.75 (95% CI: 0.55, 1.02), p=0.068 and adjHR 0.76 (95% CI: 0.53, 1.09), p=0.135, respectively. In contrast, combination therapy yielded a statistically significant increased risk of pneumonia, relative to placebo-adjHR 1.80 (95% CI: 1.46, 2.21), p < 0.001.
   Conclusion: In GLI-based moderate-to-severe COPD, combination therapy yields a statistically significant increased risk of pneumonia but the reductions in mortality are not statistically significant, although could potentially be clinically meaningful.

AB Introduction: Handheld spirometers for home use by patients allow longitudinal spirometry data to be collected daily and may overcome some of the limitations of in-clinic spirometry (long intervals between measurements, results can be affected by site-based coaching and patient's asthma status during a given visit).
   Objectives: To determine the relationship between spirometry values measured by clinic-based and handheld spirometers during a clinical trial.
   Methods: A post hoc correlation analysis of data from a 6-week phase 3 study of beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP; delivered by breath-actuated inhaler: BAI) versus placebo in patients aged >= 12 years with persistent asthma. During the study, forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) was assessed by both office-based spirometry at Weeks 2, 4 and 6, and daily by handheld spirometer as a secondary study endpoint.
   Results: There was a high correlation between FEV1 values measured at home and in-clinic (overall correlation coefficient=0.8393, R=0.81921, 0.85927, 0.85369 and 0.83734 for BAI 320 mu g/day, BAI 640 mu g/day, BDP metered dose inhaler 320 mu g/day and placebo treatment groups, respectively), with the scatterplot showing an upward trend for all treatment groups. Nearly all patients achieved home FEV1 values close to clinic FEV1 values, with very few outliers.
   Conclusions: Clinic-based and handheld spirometry demonstrated comparable treatment effects relative to placebo, suggesting that home spirometry could be used to help patients monitor their asthma severity. Daily measurement of FEV1 provides more comprehensive data than can be achieved through clinic visits, and may lead to a new approach to clinical trial design.

AB Asthma is often associated with different comorbidities such as cardiovascular diseases, depression, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidaemia, osteoporosis, rhinosinusitis and mainly gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and allergic rhinitis. Although bronchodilators play an important role in the treatment of asthma, there is no overall description of their impact on comorbid asthma, regardless of whether favourable or negative. This narrative review examines the potential effects of bronchodilators on comorbidities of asthma.

AB Objective: This study is to investigate the status and clinical significance of respiratory viruses in bronch-oalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of children with PBB.
   Methods: Sixty-eight children with PBB aged from 3 months to 5 years were enrolled and retrospectively reviewed from January 2014 to December 2017. Thirty-five children with persistent pneumonia or chronic pneumonia were matched as controls. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples were collected for respiratory virus detection and bacterial culture.
   Results: The detection rate of bacteria in BALF of children with PBB was 61.8%, which was significantly higher than that of control group (20%) (P < 0.001). The detection rate of virus in BALF of children with PBB was 23.5%, including 6 (8.8%) of rhinovirus, 4 (5.9%) of parainfluenza virus type 3, 2(2.9%) of bocavirus, 2 (2.9%) of respiratory syncytial virus 1 (1.5%) of human metapneumonia virus and 1 (1.5%) of influenza virus A. 10 cases (28.6%) of virus were detected in the control group, including 3 (8.6%) respiratory syncytial virus, 3 (8.6%) rhinovirus and 2 (5.7%) bocavirus. There was no significant difference of viral detection rate between the two groups (P=0.577).
   Conclusion: Respiratory viruses can be detected in BALF of children with PBB, However, there is no evidence that PBB is virus-induced.

TI A high blood eosinophil count may be a risk factor for incident asthma
   in population at risk
SO RESPIRATORY MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
DE Blood eosinophil counts; Incident asthma; Risk factor
ID ADULT-ONSET ASTHMA; EXACERBATIONS; PREVALENCE; ROLES
AB Background: Eosinophilia is considered to be associated with allergic disease and may predict asthma exacerbation. Eosinophils contribute to the pathophysiology and pathogenesis of asthma. However, studies on high blood eosinophil counts (BECs) and incident asthma remain scarce.
   Objective: To examine whether high BECs are positively associated with incident asthma in adults.
   Methods: Our study included 57975 participants aged from 20 to 79 years from the Shandong multi-center health check-up longitudinal study for Health Management. All patients with determined baseline BECs were >= 20 years old and free from asthma. We defined incident asthma as self-reported new-onset asthma occurring during the 10-year follow-up period. Multivariate modeling employed Poisson regression and Cox proportional hazards models to verify the association between BEC and incident asthma by adjusting demographics and some relevant comorbidities (rhinitis, nasal polyps, pneumonia, bronchitis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).
   Results: A BEC >= 110 cells/mu L was a risk factor for incident asthma (adjusted IRR=1.62, 95% CI: 1.05-2.50, P=.028) in the Poisson regression. In the Cox proportional hazards model, the BEC cutoff point for incident asthma was also determined to be 110 cells/mu L (HR=1.59, 95% CI: 1.01-2.51, P=.045).
   Conclusion: A high BEC is a risk factor for incident asthma, especially when the BEC exceeds 110 cells/mu L. This suggests that adults with high BECs are more likely to develop asthma.

AB Objective: To study whether abnormal spirometric patterns were associated with differential mortality in Chinese adults with and without dyspnea.
   Methods: Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study (GBCS) participants were classified by spirometric patterns and presence of dyspnea into 6 groups: normal spirometry (NS), restriction on spirometry (ROS) and airflow obstruction (AO), each with and without dyspnea. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) were calculated for mortality using Cox models.
   Results: Among 16777 subjects, 1595 (9.5%) had ROS, 1036 (6.2%) had AO and 1009 (6.0%) had dyspnea. A total of 1993 deaths (11.9%) occurred during 11-year follow-up. Using NS without dyspnea as reference, NS with dyspnea was significantly associated with increased cardiovascular mortality risk (aHRs 1.61 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.18-2.19); ROS with and without dyspnea were associated with increased risks of all-cause (aHRs 1.46 (95% CI 1.28-1.66) and 1.81 (95% CI 1.33-2.47)) and cardiovascular mortality (aHRs 1.89 (95% CI 1.55-2.31) and 1.85 (95% CI 1.12-3.03)), but not of lung cancer mortality (aHRs 1.33 (95% CI 0.91-1.94) and 1.35 (95% CI 0.49-3.70)); AO with and without dyspnea were associated with increased risks of all-cause (aHRs 1.59 (95% CI 1.36-1.86) and 2.36 (95% CI 1.77-3.15)), cardiovascular (aHRs 1.43 (95% CI 1.08-1.90) and 1.61 (95% CI 0.91-2.82)) and lung cancer mortality (aHRs 1.91 (95% CI 1.29-2.84) and 3.01 (95% CI 1.46-6.23)). These associations did not vary by sex or smoking status (all P-values for interaction > 0.05).
   Conclusion: Both ROS and AO, with and without dyspnea, were associated with increased all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality. The increased risk of all-cause was greater and that of cardiovascular mortality was lower for AO than ROS. AO showed significantly increased risk of lung cancer but ROS did not. (272 words).

AB Physical activity is reduced in patients with chronic pulmonary diseases. Activity monitors can measure physical activity objectively and accurately over prolonged periods of time. Research grade and commercially available devices, using accelerometer technology, are being increasingly used in clinical studies. Physical activity levels have been found to have a moderate to strong correlation with important measures such as pulmonary function, exercise capacity, quality of life, and mortality and hospitalizations in patients with COPD, interstitial lung disease, pulmonary arterial hypertension and cystic fibrosis. Their use as a clinical trial end-point and as a tool to augment rehabilitation efforts has also been explored in patients with COPD with variable results. Due to the ease of use, economic viability, widespread availability and good patient compliance, their use in adult and pediatric medicine is expanding. This narrative review summarizes the current evidence of use of activity monitors in COPD, interstitial lung disease, asthma, pulmonary arterial hypertension, cystic fibrosis and lung transplant patients for the purposes of prognostication, monitoring, outcome measures and intervention.

AB Background: Cystic fibrosis (CF) and primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) are characterized by impaired mucociliary clearance causing sinopulmonary infections and airway inflammation. However, they differ in many aspects including multisystemic involvement and disease severity.
   Aim: To compare sleep disorders and their correlation with quality of life (QOL) in three distinct patient populations: CF and pancreatic insufficiency (CF-PI), pancreatic sufficiency (CF-PS) and PCD.
   Methods: Patients completed age appropriate sleep quality questionnaires (SDSC, PSQI), quality of life questionnaires (PedQL, QOL-BE) and the Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS). Medical records were reviewed for clinical data.
   Results: Eighty patients, 33 CF-PI, 27 CF-PS, and 20 PCD; 40 females; 41 adults and 39 children completed the study. In adults, 66% slept less than 7 h per night, and sleep quality was reduced in 26.5%, 53% reported night wakings and 47% nocturnal snoring or coughing. In children 78% slept more than 8 h, SDSC scores were mostly in the normal range. A significant correlation was found between sleep quality and QOL in both age groups. Global sleep scores were correlated with hemoglobin levels. Despite differences in disease severity and QOL, there were no significant differences in sleep quality between the three groups.
   Conclusion: Sleep disorders are common and correlate with QOL in CF and PCD. Despite differences in disease characteristics and severity, there are no differences in terms of sleep disorders between CF-PI, CF-PS and PCD patients, suggesting that they may represent indirect outcomes of disease.

AB Objective: The aim of the present study was to investigate the Th2/Th17 pathway in asthmatic patients and also the relationship to asthma severity and biomarkers of inflammation.
   Methods: 90 asthmatic patients, 51 patients with severe, 39 patients with mild asthma and 98 healthy controls were included. Skin prick tests, blood eosinophils, total serum IgE and exhaled FeNO were evaluated. Serum levels of IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, IL-6, IL-17A, IL-23 and TGF beta 1 were determined by Flow Cytometry using a panel kit (AimPlex Biosciences). The SNP of IL17A (rs17880588) was genotyped using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
   Results: The genotype of the SNP in IL17A (rs 17880588) was similar among all three groups. Serum levels of IL4, IL-5, IL-13, IL-6, IL-17A and IL-23 were higher in asthmatics compared to controls (p < 0.05). In addition, IL17A and IL-4 serum levels were found significantly elevated in patients with allergic asthma (p < 0.05). Furthermore, IL-4, IL-5, IL-13 and IL-23 were found significantly higher in patients with eosinophil cut off values above 300 cells/mu l (p < 0.05). IL-17A levels were positively correlated with FeNO values in severe asthmatics with eosinophils > 400 cells/mu l.
   Conclusions: The above findings suggest the coexistence of Th2/Th17 pathway in severe, eosinophilic and in allergic asthma.

AB Background: Approximately 60% of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) diagnoses are position-dependent, and avoidance of the supine position could represent an effective treatment. Nevertheless, the majority of the available anti-supine treatments result in discomfort and low adherence. This study evaluated the effectiveness of a new vibrating supine avoidance device in reducing time spent in the supine position and the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) without affecting sleep structure. Furthermore, the tolerability and satisfaction were also scored.
   Methods: Observational prospective study of patients suffering from positional OSA. They were treated with a vibrating device and followed up at the first and fourth weeks after starting the treatment, and further polysomnographic studies were conducted while patients' wore the device. The comparison of the results was carried out through non-parametric tests. Significance level was 5%.
   Results: Twelve patients had complete data. The device reduced time spent in the supine position (from 51.5 +/- 14.8% to 25.2 +/- 21.0%, p = 0.005), median AHI (from 30.7 (23.2-38.2) at baseline to 21.5 (12.4-24.3) at the fourth week, p = 0.002). Also an improvement in the minimum SaO(2) (from 82.2 +/- 7.5 to 87.2 +/- 3.6 at the 4th week) was also observed. No variations in sleep quality or quantity were identified. All patients evaluated the device positively.
   Conclusion: Our device was effective in reducing the time spent in the supine position and improving AHI, SaO(2) variables and sleep architecture. The device was well tolerated by the patients.

ID SERUM PERIOSTIN; FENO
AB Background: Allergic asthma is characterized by type 2 inflammation. Periostin has been proposed as type 2 biomarker.
   Objective: To test the hypothesis that serum periostin could be associated with the asthma control grade in a group of children with allergic asthma and recruited in clinical practice.
   Patients and methods: 121 consecutive children (71 males, 50 females, mean age 11.6 +/- 3.2 years) with allergic asthma were visited for the first time at a third-level paediatric clinic. Serum periostin was evaluated with gender, BMI and z score BMI, lung function, FeNO, ACT questionnaire, VAS of breathing perception, peripheral eosinophils, total serum IgE, oral corticosteroid (CS) use in the past year, control asthma grade and asthma severity (according to GINA document).
   Results: Serum periostin was not associated with the asthma control grade and did not correlate with blood eosinophils and FeNO. In addition, peripheral eosinophils, serum IgE, and FeNO were not associated with the asthma control grade. On the contrary, gender, FEV1, FEV1/FVC ratio, FEF25-75, ACT, VAS of breathing perception, oral corticosteroid use, and asthma severity grade were associated with the asthma control grade.
   Conclusions: Serum periostin seems to be scarcely useful to assess the asthma control in children with allergic asthma in clinical practice. There is the need to identify reliable inflammation biomarkers able to correlate with the asthma control grade.

DE Bronchiectasis; Incidence; Resource use; Hospitalization; Comorbidities
ID PREVALENCE; ADULTS
AB Background: Incidence and prevalence of patients with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFB) appear to be increasing worldwide but supporting epidemiological data are scarce. This study assesses the incidence of NCFB patients in Germany in 2013 and analyzes comorbidities and basic patterns of resource use.
   Methods: A representative sample of 3.988.648 anonymized persons covered by German public statutory health insurances was used to identify incident patients with NCFB in 2013.
   Results: After extrapolation to the general population of the 728 patients found in the reference insurance database, we estimate that a total of 17,095 NCFB patients were newly diagnosed across the country in 2013 as having NCFB. This corresponds to an incidence of 21.23 per 100.000 inhabitants. The majority of NCFB patients (98.4%) was at least 18 years old, and 52.7% of the NCFB patients were male. Trend analysis shows a rise of NCFB incidence in Germany from 2011 through 2013.
   COPD (41.4%), asthma (32.8%) and gastroesophageal reflux (18.3%) were the most frequent predisposing conditions. Coronary heart disease was observed in more than one quarter of NCFB patients (28.2%). 58.4% of the NCFB outpatients received antiobstructive inhalative medication. Of the adult NCFB patients, 51.6% were prescribed antibiotics to treat NCFB by settled doctors (outpatient treatment); 51.5% of those patients were males. The peak of antibiotic treatment was observed in the 75-79 age group for males and 70-74 and 75-79 years for females. The majority of diagnosed patients (54.1%) received at least two prescriptions during 2013. Bacterial pathogens were coded for a total of 10.7% of NCFB patients, while Pseudomonas aeruginosa was only documented in 2.3%.
   Among those diagnosed in 2013, 8.0% of the adult NCFB patients who received antibiotic treatment had to be hospitalized.
   Conclusions: Although hospital admissions due to exacerbation in the first year of diagnosing NCFB are not rare, outpatient burden and costs must also be considered a major part of care. Given the increasing recognition of NCFB, a better understanding of the economic burden of the disease is required, with a view towards improving patient management. For this, more detailed, prospective studies are needed.

AB Introduction: Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is recommended for treatment of acute hypercapnic respiratory failure (AHRF) refractory to medical management in patients with COPD. This study investigated the relationship between time from hospital presentation to diagnosis of AHRF and in-hospital mortality.
   Methods: Retrospective analysis of hospitalised COPD patients treated with a first episode of ward-based NIV for AHRF at a large UK teaching hospital between 2004 and 2017. Data collected prospectively as part of NIV service evaluation. Multivariable logistic regression performed to identify predictors of in-hospital mortality.
   Results: In total, 547 unique patients were studied comprising 245 males (44.8%), median age 70.6 years, median FEV1% predicted 34%. Overall in-hospital mortality was 19% (n = 104); median survival was 1.7 years. In univariate analysis, a longer time between hospital presentation to diagnosis of AHRF was associated with inhospital mortality (median [IQR]: 8.7 [0.7-75.8] hours vs. 1.9 [0.3-13.6] hours, p < 0.0001). In multivariable logistic regression, significant predictors of in-hospital mortality were AHRF > 24 h after hospital presentation (odds ratio [95% CI]: 2.29 [1.33-3.95], p = 0.003), pneumonia on admission (1.81 [1.07-3.08], p = 0.027), increased age (1.10 [1.07-1.14], p < 0.001) and NIV as ceiling of treatment (5.86 [2.87-11.94], p < 0.001).
   Conclusions: Hospitalised COPD patients with late presentation of AHRF, requiring acute ward-based NIV, may have increased in-hospital mortality. These patients may benefit from closer monitoring and earlier specialist respiratory review.

TI The role of microRNAs in chronic pseudomonas lung infection in Cystic

ID CELLS; IDENTIFICATION; DISCOVERY; APOPTOSIS
AB Background: Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is the most common life limiting genetic disorder, characterized by chronic respiratory failure secondary to inflammation and chronic bacterial lung infection. Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infection is associated with more severe lung disease and rapid progression of respiratory failure when compared to Staphylococcus aureus infection. We hypothesized that a specific signature of epigenetic factors targeting specific gene transcripts contributes to the increased morbidity seen in CF patients with chronic Pseudomonas infection.
   Methods: We collected exhaled breath condensate (EBC) from 27 subjects and evaluated miRNA signatures in these samples using commercial PCR array. We identified predicted mRNA targets and associated signaling pathways using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis.
   Results: We found 11 differentially expressed miRNAs in EBC of patients infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa compared to EBC from CF patients who were not chronically infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (p < 0.05). Six of these miRNAs (hsa-miRNA-1247, hsa-miRNA-1276, hsa-miRNA-449c, hsa-miRNA-3170, hsa-miRNA-432-5p and hsa-miR-548) were significantly different in the CF Pseudomonas positive group when compared to both the CF Pseudomonas negative group and healthy control group. Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) revealed organismal injury and abnormalities, reproductive system disease and cancer as the top diseases and bio functions associated with these miRNAs. IPA also detected RELA, JUN, TNF, IL-10, CTNNB1, IL-13, SERPINB8, CALM1, STARD3NL, SFI1, CD55, RPS6KA4, TTC36 and HIST1H3D as the top target genes for these miRNAs.
   Conclusion: Our study identified 6 miRNAs as epigenetic factors specifically associated with chronic Pseudomonas infection in patients with CF.

ID DOUBLE-BLIND; MULTICENTER; DREAM
AB Background: In patients with severe eosinophilic asthma, treatment decisions can be determined by blood eosinophil counts; however, a specific blood eosinophil threshold has not been defined for starting mepolizumab treatment.
   Methods: We summarized the disease burden and efficacy of mepolizumab in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma and baseline blood eosinophil counts of >= 150-300 cells/mu L and >= 300 cells/mu L using data from the mepolizumab clinical development program (DREAM [NCT01000506], MENSA [NCT01691521], SIRIUS [NCT01691508] and MUSCA [NCT02281318]).
   Results: The morbidity of asthma in patients with baseline blood eosinophil counts >= 150-300 cells/mu L was similar to that in patients with blood eosinophil counts >= 300 cells/mu L, with similar rates of exacerbations (2.8-3.5 events/year versus 2.8-3.8 events/year, respectively), asthma related emergency room visits, intubations and near fatal events. Use of maintenance oral corticosteroids (OCS) was similar across blood eosinophil count subgroups. Reductions in the rates of clinically significant exacerbations with mepolizumab versus placebo ranged from 27 to 49% in patients with blood eosinophil counts of >= 150-300 cells/mu L for DREAM, MENSA and MUSCA. The odds of achieving a reduction in OCS in SIRIUS was 2.03 (95% CI: 0.53, 7.75) versus 1.79 (95% CI: 0.71, 4.52) in patients with blood eosinophil counts >= 150-300 cells/mu L and >= 300 cells/mu L, respectively.
   Conclusion: There is a high unmet clinical need in patients with blood eosinophil counts >= 150-300 cells/mu L, and a clinically meaningful benefit is seen with mepolizumab in this subgroup. Mepolizumab is an efficacious treatment option for patients with blood eosinophil counts >= 150 cells/mu L.

AB Background: Knowing the patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) that increase the physical activity of daily living (PADL) after pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is a challenge. Aims: to compare baseline characteristics between patients who achieved and failed to achieve the minimal important difference (MID) of PADL post-PR; to verify which baseline variables better predict the change and identify a cut-off point to discriminate MID achievers.
   Methods: Fifty-three patients with COPD (FEV1: 38.3; 95% CI 34.4-42.2% pred) were evaluated for spirometry, dyspnea, quality of life, functional capacity, mortality risk and PADL level. After 24 sessions of PR had their PADL level revaluated.
   Results: The MID achievers presented lower FEV1, functional capacity, time walking, number of steps, active time, energy expenditure (EE) walking, time on PADL=3 metabolic equivalent of task (METs) and higher time on PADL< 1.5MET. Inactive patients and with severe physical inactivity presented a hazard ratio of 4.27 and 6.90 (95% CI: 1.31-13.9, p=0.02; 95% CI: 1.99-23.9, p=0.002; respectively) for achieving the MID. The variables of predictive model for the change in the PADL were EE walking and time on PADL< 1.5MET (R-2: 0.37; p=0.002). The cut-off point of 6525 steps [sensitivity=95%; specificity=61%; AUC=0.82 (95% CI: 0.71-0.93), p < 0.001] was able to discriminate patients who achieved and failed to achieve the MID.
   Conclusion: Patients with worse lung function, functional capacity and lower PADL level before PR are those that improve the PADL level. EE walking and time on PADL< 1.5MET better predict this change. The cut-off point of 6525 steps can help to identify patients with higher chances of improving the PADL level.

AB Immunization with the Japanese encephalitis (JE) vaccine IXIARO (R) results in protective neutralizing antibody levels for one year. Since persistence of protective titer levels beyond one year was unknown, a 5 years follow-up study was conducted. Additionally, data were stratified to compare the persistence of protective neutralizing antibodies against JE in people with or without tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) vaccination.
   Four weeks after the primary series, the percentage of subjects with PRNT50 titer >= 1:10 in the intent-to-treat population was 99%; the rate after 5 years was 81.6%. By month 24, 36, 48 and 60, the percentages were still 90.7%, 91.7%, 90.1%, 85.9%, respectively in the population who had received TBE vaccine compared to 67.9%, 71.9%, 69.1%, 63.8% in the population who had not. No long-term safety concerns were identified.
   These data indicate that vaccination with IXIARO (R) is able to induce protective titers that persist up to 60 months after the primary immunization. (C) 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB A prenatal care provider's recommendation for maternal vaccines is one of the strongest predictors of vaccine acceptance during pregnancy. Aside from basic talking points, few resources exist to help obstetric care providers effectively navigate conversations with vaccine hesitant patients. This paper describes the development and acceptability of "VaxChat," an hour-long, evidence-based video tutorial aimed at improving obstetric care providers' ability to promote maternal vaccines. Between June and November 2017, 62 obstetric care providers registered to receive continuing medical education credit for viewing VaxChat. Of the post-tutorial responses received, over 90% said VaxChat increased their knowledge of what to say to vaccine hesitant patients, increased their confidence in addressing vaccinations with their pregnant patients, and will help them improve their practice culture regarding maternal vaccine promotion. Eighty percent intend to change how they approach vaccine conversations. These data suggest VaxChat may be a welcome complement to existing provider-to-patient talking points. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Clinical trials covering the immunogenicity of a vaccine aim to study the longitudinal dynamics of certain immune cells after vaccination. The corresponding immunogenicity datasets are mainly analyzed by the use of statistical (mixed effects) models. This paper proposes the use of mathematical ordinary differential equation (ODE) models, combined with a mixed effects approach. ODE models are capable of translating underlying immunological post vaccination processes into mathematical formulas thereby enabling a testable data analysis. Mixed models include both population-averaged parameters (fixed effects) and individual-specific parameters (random effects) for dealing with inter- and intra-individual variability, respectively.
   This paper models B-cell and T-cell datasets of a phase I/II, open-label, randomized, parallel-group study (NCT00492648) in which the immunogenicity of a new Herpes Zoster vaccine (Shingrix) is compared with the original Varicella Zoster Virus vaccine (Varilrix).
   Since few significant correlations were found between the B-cell and T-cell datasets, each dataset was modeled separately. By following a general approach to both the formulation of several different models and the procedure of selecting the most suitable model, we were able to propose a mathematical ODE mixed-effects model for each dataset. As such, the use of ODE-based mixed effects models offers a suitable framework for handling longitudinal vaccine immunogenicity data. Moreover, this approach allows testing for differences in immunological processes between vaccines or schedules. We found that the Shingrix vaccination schedule led to a more pronounced proliferation of T-cells, without a difference in T-cell decay rate compared to the Varilrix vaccination schedule.

AB Background: A lyophilized bovine-human rotavirus reassortant pentavalent vaccine (BRV-PV, Rotasiil (R)) was licensed in 2016. A liquid formulation of this vaccine (LBRV-PV, Rotasiil - Liquid) was subsequently developed and was tested for non-inferiority to Rotasiil (R) and for lot-to-lot consistency.
   Methods: This Phase open II/III, randomized study was conducted at seven sites across India from November 2017 to June 2018. Participants were randomized into four arms; Lots A, B, and C of LBRV-PV and Rotasiil (R) in 1:1:1:1 ratio. Three doses of study vaccines were given at 6, 10, and 14 weeks of age. Blood samples were collected four weeks after the third dose to assess rotavirus IgA antibody levels. Non-inferiority of LBRV-PV to Rotasiil was proven if the lower limit two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) of geometric mean concentration (GMC) ratio was at least 0.5. Lot-to-lot consistency was proven if 95% CI of the GMC ratios of three lots were between 0.5 and 2. Solicited reactions were collected by using diary cards.
   Results: Of the 1500 randomized infants, 1436 infants completed the study. The IgA GMC ratio of LBRV-PV to Rotasiil (R) was 1.19 (95% CI 0.96, 1.48). The corresponding IgA seropositivity rates were 60.41% (57.41, 63.35) and 52.75% (47.48, 57.97). The IgA GMC ratios among the three LBRV-PV lots were: Lot A versus Lot B: 1.34 (1.03, 1.75); Lot A versus Lot C: 1.22 (0.93, 1.60); and Lot B versus Lot C: 0.91 (0.69, 1.19). The 95% Cls for the GMC ratios were between 0.69 and 1.75. The incidence of solicited reactions was comparable across the four arms. Only one serious adverse event of gastroenteritis event in the Rotasiil (R) group was causally related.
   Conclusion: The immunological non-inferiority of LBRV-PV against Rotasiil as well as lot-to-lot consistency of LBRV-PV was demonstrated. LBRV-PV had safety profile similar to Rotasiil (R). (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Influenza A/H7N9 viruses are undergoing antigenic drift since their emergence in 2013, and vaccination strategies are needed for pandemic preparedness. Two doses of adjuvanted monovalent inactivated influenza A/H7N9 vaccine (IIV1 A/H7N9) are needed for optimal serological responses. However, administering 2 doses in a pandemic setting might be challenging. We evaluated the immunogenicity of "boosting" with IIVI A/H7N9 in subjects "primed" 8 years previously with IIV1 A/H7N7.
   Methods: We administered 1 booster dose containing 45 mcg of IIVI A/H7N9 hemagglutinin to 17 recipients of 2 prior doses of IIV1 A/H7N7, and to 10 influenza A/H7-naive subjects. We tested their post-boosting sera for antibodies (Ab) against homologous influenza A/H7N9 using a hemagglutination inhibition assay; and compared their Ab titers to those in stored sera from recipients of AS03-adjuvanted IIVI A/H7N9 against 9 strains of influenza A/H7N9 viruses.
   Results: The percentage of subjects with Ab titers >= 40 on Days 9 and 29 post boosting, respectively, was 65% and 41% in primed subjects and 10% and 0% in unprimed subjects. The Ab titers in recipients of AS03-adjuvanted IIV1 A/H7N9 were higher than those in the prime-boost group against a panel of influenza A/H7N9 viruses, except for 2 highly pathogenic strains.
   Conclusions: Priming with IIVI A/H7 results in serological responses following a delayed boost with 1 dose of unadjuvanted IIV1 A/H7N9, despite lack of antibody response after the prime. Optimizing prime-boost approaches would benefit pandemic preparedness. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Maternal immunization with pertussis acellular vaccine (Tdap) is an intervention that provides protection to newborns. However, it has been reported that high maternal antibody levels may adversely affect the immune response of infants after active immunization. In this study, we evaluated neonatal passive acquisition of pertussis-specific antibodies and their influence on the neonatal cell-mediated immune response.
   Pregnant women were either vaccinated with Tdap vaccine (case group, n = 66) or received no vaccine (control group, n = 101). Whole-cell Bordetella pertussis (Bp), pertussis toxin (PT), filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA) and pertactin (PRN)-specific serum IgG were quantified in paired maternal-cord sera, and Bp- and PT-specific IgA were evaluated in colostrum by ELISA. Ex vivo neonatal blood lymphocyte responsiveness after Bp stimulation was assessed in case (n = 17) and control (n = 15) groups using flow cytometry to detect proliferation, cytokine production and activation phenotype of lymphocytes in the context of high specific IgG acquired after maternal vaccination.
   Anti-Bp, PT, FHA and PRN IgG concentrations in maternal and cord sera from case group were higher than those in control group with positive correlation indexes in both groups for all pertussis antigens. The control group presented higher placental transfer ratios of specific antibodies and, in the case group, vaccination between 26 and 31 gestation weeks was associated with the best placental transfer ratios. Specific IgA concentrations in colostrum were not affected by vaccine status. Whole blood assays revealed that newborns responded to Bp stimulation with higher expression of CD40L, CD69 and CD4(+) T cell proliferation compared to unstimulated cells, and a lower Thl response, while a preserved Th2 response compared to adults, but there were no differences between the neonatal groups for any of the studied parameters.
   Our results indicate that higher pertussis-specific IgG levels in newborn sera after maternal vaccination do not affect the neonatal ex vivo cell-mediated immune response. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID THEORETICAL DOMAINS FRAMEWORK
AB Background: In 2013-15, Denmark experienced an increase in reported suspected adverse events following vaccination (AEFI) against human papilloma virus (HPV). Dedicated centres ("One Access") were established in order to standardize management of patients who experienced medically unexplained physical symptoms after HPV vaccination. Since One Access was targeted patients with suspected AEFI after HPV vaccination, we used this opportunity to estimate completeness in AEFI reporting to the Danish Medicines Agency (DMA), and explore the topic of AEFI reporting from the perspective of physicians working at the centres to better understand health professionals' reporting behaviour.
   Methods: The study consisted of a quantitative and a qualitative part. In the quantitative analysis, we used the Danish civil registry number to merge a line-list of all One Access patients referred in 2015 with total number of patients who had reported suspected serious AEFI following HPV vaccination to the DMA in the years 2009-2015. We conducted four semi-structured interviews with doctors representing three out of five regions. The Theoretical Domains Framework together with empirical data from two clinical fieldtrips guided the formation of the qualitative study.
   Results: Among 1577 One Access patients, only 404 (26%) were reported to the DMA. We found significant regional differences in reporting completeness (p < 0.001) and differences between regions when looking at reporters' backgrounds (healthcare professionals vs non-professionals; p = 0.004). We identified several factors of importance for reporting behaviour amongst physicians, mainly under the domains of Knowledge, Motivation & Goals, and Environmental Context.
   Conclusions: Despite an official aim of homogenous case management, reporting of suspected AEFI was incomplete with large regional differences. The qualitative study corroborated that reporting behaviour was contextual. This observation represents an important caveat in interpreting data from AEFI reporting, in particular when these data are used for research or policymaking. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Two conserved pneumococcal proteins, pneumolysin toxoid (dPly) and pneumococcal histidine triad protein D (PhtD), combined with 10 polysaccharide conjugates from the pneumococcal non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae protein D-conjugate vaccine (PHiD-CV) in two investigational pneumococcal vaccine (PHiD-CV/dPly/PhtD) formulations were immunogenic and well-tolerated when administered to Gambian children. Here, we report immunogenicity of the polysaccharide conjugates, and immunogenicity and reactogenicity of co-administered routine vaccines.
   Methods: In this phase II, controlled, observer-blind, single-centre study, healthy infants aged 810 weeks were randomised (1:1:1:1:1:1) to six groups. Four groups received 3+0 schedule (2-3-4 months [M]) of PHiD-CV/dPly/PhtD (10 or 3014 of each protein), PHiD-CV, or 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine; and two groups received 2+1 schedule (2-4-9 M) of PHiD-CV/dPly/PhtD (30 mu g of each protein) or PHiD-CV. All infants received diphtheria-tetanus-whole cell pertussis-hepatitis B-Haemophilus influenzae type b (DTPw-HBV/Hib) and oral trivalent polio vaccines (OPV) at 2-3-4 M, and measles, yellow fever, and OPV vaccines at 9 M. We evaluated immune responses at 2-5-9-12 M; and reactogenicity 0-3 days post-vaccination.
   Results: 1200 infants were enrolled between June 2011 and May 2012; 1152 completed the study. 1 M post-primary vaccination, for each PHiD-CV serotype except 6B and 23F, >= 97.4% (3+0 schedule) and >= 96.4% (2+1 schedule) of infants had antibody concentrations >= 0.2 mu g/mL. Immune responses were comparable between groups within the same vaccination schedules. Observed antibody geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) increased by 1 M post-primary vaccination compared to pre-vaccination. In the following months, GMCs and opsonophagocytic activity titres waned, with an increase post-booster for the 2+1 schedule. Immune responses to protein D and, DTPw-HBV/Hib, OPV, measles, and yellow fever vaccines were not altered by co-administration with pneumococcal proteins. Reactogenicity of co-administered vaccines was comparable between groups and did not raise concerns.
   Conclusion: Immune responses to the 10 PHiD-CV polysaccharide conjugates-administered vaccines were not altered by addition of dPly and PhtD. (C) 2019 GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals SA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a major global cause of nosocomial and community-acquired infections. Despite potentially severe or fatal complications and frequent recurrence, no preventive vaccine is currently available. This randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled phase 1 study in older Japanese adults evaluated safety and immunogenicity of an investigational C difficile vaccine containing a mixture of genetically detoxified and chemically inactivated toxoids, A and B.
   Methods: Healthy Japanese adults aged 65 to 85 years were randomized in a 3:3:2 ratio to receive 100 or 200 mu g of C difficile vaccine or placebo, respectively, at 0, 1, and 6 months (month regimen) or 1, 8, and 30 days (day regimen). The primary objective was safety evaluation. Vaccine immunogenicity, the secondary objective, was determined by assessing toxin A- and toxin B-specific neutralizing antibody levels in human sera.
   Results: Local reactions were reported by up to 33.3% of subjects per dose in the month regimen; percentages were generally higher in the 200-mu g group. Such reactions were all mild or moderate in severity and generally transient. No adverse events in the month regimen led to subject withdrawal, and no serious adverse events were considered vaccine related. Further enrollment and dosing in the day regimen were discontinued after 3 subjects in the 100-mu g group reported severe redness after dose 2. In the month regimen study arm, immune responses as measured by toxin -neutralizing antibody geometric mean concentrations, geometric mean fold rises, and proportions of subjects achieving prespecified fold rises were generally higher in the 200-mu g group, peaked at month 7, and remained elevated at month 12.
   Conclusions: The C difficile vaccine candidate was safe, well tolerated, and immunogenic when administered to healthy older Japanese adults at 0, 1, and 6 months. Results support continued development of the vaccine for the prevention of CDI. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background and aims: Persons who inject drugs (PWID) are at highest risk for acquiring and transmitting hepatitis C (HCV) infection. The recent availability of oral direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy with reported cure rates >90% can prevent HCV transmission, making HCV elimination an attainable goal among PWID. The World Health Organization (WHO) recently proposed a 90% reduction in HCV incidence as a key objective. However, given barriers to the use of DAAs in PWID, including cost, restricted access to DAAs, and risk of reinfection, combination strategies including the availability of effective vaccines are needed to eradicate HCV as a public health threat. This study aims to model the cost and efficacy of a dual modality approach using HCV vaccines combined with DAAs to reduce HCV incidence by 90% and prevalence by 50% in PWID populations.
   Methods: We developed a mathematical model that represents the HCV epidemic among PWID and calibrated it to empirical data from metropolitan Chicago, Illinois. Four medical interventions were considered: vaccination of HCV naive PWID, DAA treatment, DAA treatment followed by vaccination, and, a combination of vaccination and DAA treatment.
   Results: The combination of vaccination and DAAs is the lowest cost-expensive intervention for achieving the WHO target of 90% incidence reduction. The use of DAAs without a vaccine is much less cost-effective with the additional risk of reinfection after treatment. Vaccination of nave PWID alone, even when scaled-up to all reachable PWID, cannot achieve 90% reduction of incidence in high-prevalence populations due to infections occurring before vaccination. Similarly, the lowest cost-expensive way to halve prevalence in 15 years is through the combination of vaccination and DAAs.
   Conclusions: The modeling results underscore the importance of developing an effective HCV vaccine and augmenting DAAs with vaccines in HCV intervention strategies in order to achieve efficient reductions in incidence and prevalence. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO VACCINE

DT Article

ID BURDEN
AB Background: Resurgences of pertussis have occurred in several high-income countries, often linked to waning of immunity from acellular pertussis vaccines. The degree of waning observed has varied by study design and setting. In Ontario, pertussis has not shown a substantial resurgence in the past decade. The routine immunization schedule comprises three priming doses in infancy, toddler and pre-school doses, and an adolescent dose at 14-16 years of age.
   Methods: We estimated pertussis vaccine effectiveness (VE) through a case-control study of 1335 cases statutorily reported to public health in Ontario and occurring between January 1,2009 and March 31, 2015, compared with 5340 randomly selected population controls, frequency-matched by age, primary-care provider and year of diagnosis. Pertussis cases met provincial confirmed or probable case definitions. We used multivariable logistic regression to estimate crude and adjusted odds ratios (aOR).
   Results: VE against pertussis was sustained between 92% (95% confidence interval (95%CI) 88-95%) in 2-3 year olds and 90% (95%CI: 80-95%) in 8-9 year olds, but fell rapidly to 49% (95%CI: 2-73%) in children 12-13 years of age. VE following the teenage booster given at 14-16 years in Ontario reached 76% (95%CI: 52-88%) in 14-16 year olds and 78% (95%CI: -31 to 96%) in those 16-22 years old. For children who were up-to-date with the immunization schedule, VE declined from 87% (95%CI: 84-90%) during the first year to 74% (95%CI: 63-82%) after 8 or more years following their last dose of immunization.
   Conclusions: VE is high during the first decade of life but then falls rapidly. Protection is not fully restored by the teenage booster. Our findings are consistent with the localized outbreaks we observe in high school children and underline the importance of additional policies to protect infants.

AB The ectodomain of the influenza A virus (IAV) M2 protein (M2e) is highly conserved, and it represents a promising candidate for the development of an "universal vaccine". However, the low immunogenicity associated to M2e in a natural infection or in response to seasonal vaccines has led to explore new approaches to enhance it. In recent years, it has become clear that targeting antigens to dendritic cells (DC) is an efficient way to enhance immune responses against pathogens. In this work, the M2e peptide was chemically cross-linked to a monoclonal antibody (mAb) specific for DEC-205 (alpha-DEC-205:M2e), present on DC. BALB/c mice were inoculated subcutaneously (s.c.) three times with the conjugate equivalent to 1 mu g of M2e, in the presence of polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) as adjuvant. As controls, other groups of mice were inoculated under the same conditions with M2e cross-linked to an isotype control mAb (isotype:M2e), 5 mu g of free M2e peptide, ovalbumin (OVA) cross-linked to the alpha-DEC-205 mAb (alpha-DEC-205:OVA) or poly I:C alone. Immunization with alpha-DEC-205-M2e induced high levels of serum antibodies (Abs) compared to isotype:M2e or to free M2e peptide, and in all cases IgG1 was predominant over IgG2a Abs. Furthermore, immunization with the alpha-DEC-205:M2e conjugate did not prevent morbidity, but it induced up to 76% protection against a heterosubtypic IAV lethal challenge. Contrasting with the 20 to 40% protection induced by isotype:M2e or by free M2e peptide. The protection induced by alpha-DEC-205:M2e conjugate was dependent on non-neutralizing serum Abs and independent of effector CD4(+) T cells. These results show that targeting M2e to DEC-205 is a very effective alternative to induce strong heterosubtypic protection against an IAV infection. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: We estimated the effectiveness of seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine and the potential influence of timing of immunization on vaccine effectiveness (VE) using data from the 2016 southern hemisphere influenza season.
   Methods: Data were pooled from three routine syndromic sentinel surveillance systems in general practices in Australia. Each system routinely collected specimens for influenza testing from patients presenting with influenza-like illness. Next generation sequencing was used to characterize viruses. Using a test negative design, VE was estimated based on the odds of vaccination among influenza-positive cases as compared to influenza-negative controls. Subgroup analyses were used to estimate VE by type, subtype and lineage, as well as age group and time between vaccination and symptom onset.
   Results: A total of 1085 patients tested for influenza in 2016 were included in the analysis, of whom 447 (41%) tested positive for influenza. The majority of detections were influenza A/H3N2 (74%). One-third (31%) of patients received the 2016 southern hemisphere formulation influenza vaccine. Overall, VE was estimated at 40% (95% CI: 18-56%). VE estimates were highest for patients immunized within two months prior to symptom onset (VE: 60%; 95% CI: 26-78%) and lowest for patients immunized >4 months prior to symptom onset (VE: 19%; 95% CI: -73-62%).
   Discussion: Overall, the 2016 influenza vaccine showed good protection against laboratory-confirmed infection among general practice patients. Results by duration of vaccination suggest a significant decline in effectiveness during the 2016 influenza season, indicating immunization close to influenza season offered optimal protection.

AB We studied the whole and aftershock-depleted shallow (depth <= 30 km) Taiwanese seismicity from 1990 to 2017 by using several independent methods. The coefficient of variations and the Allan Factor have revealed that time-clustering characterizes not only the time distribution of the whole seismic catalogue, but also that of the aftershock-depleted one, although this displays time-clustering at larger timescales. In particular the Allan Factor shows that at small timescales the seismic process of the whole as well as the aftershock-depleted one can be well described by a Poisson process. The detrended fluctuation analysis clearly evidence persistence in the interevent times and weak persistence or randomness in the magnitudes. The singular spectrum analysis of the daily counts in the aftershock-depleted catalogue reveals the existence of quasi-monthly and bi-weekly periodicities. Furthermore, quasi-annual and quasi-semestral periodicities have been identified that strengthen the link between seismic activity in Taiwan and Earth's tides.

AB Clay mineral assemblages at International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 355 Site U1456 drilled in the eastern Arabian Sea have been investigated to reveal the sediment provenances and reconstruct the erosion/weathering patterns in the western Himalaya and Indian subcontinent, thus constraining the evolution of the Indian summer monsoon and its forcing mechanism since 1.2 Ma. The clay mineral assemblages at Site U1456 mainly comprise smectite (with an average value of 59%) and illite (with an average value of 33%), with chlorite (with an average value of 5%) and kaolinite (with an average value of 3%) as minor constituents. In terms of sediment provenance, our results indicate that illite and chlorite are predominantly derived from the Indus River, which originates from the western Himalaya and Karakoram, while smectite is primarily sourced from the Narmada River and Tapti River in the Deccan Traps, with a non-negligible contribution from the Indus River in some cases. Variations in smectite/(illite + chlorite) ratio are ultimately controlled by the Indian summer monsoon, which is characterized by approximate glacial/interglacial cyclicity, showing higher values (i.e., enhanced chemical weathering) during interglacial periods. In addition, a major shift in smectite/(illite + chlorite) ratio at 0.9 Ma is correlated to the Mid-Pleistocene Transition (similar to 1.2-0.9 Ma). Both the Marine Isotope Stage 13 event (533-478 ka) and the Mid-Brunhes Event (similar to 430 ka) are also recorded in the clay mineral proxies. Based on the spectral analysis, smectite/(illite + chlorite) ratio displays a transition from nonprimary periodicity (29-kyr) to strong eccentricity (100-kyr) and precession (22-kyr) periodicities at approximately 0.9 Ma, which corresponds to the Mid-Pleistocene Transition. Our study indicates that the variability of the Indian summer monsoon at orbital timescales is controlled by high-latitude (i.e., ice volume) and low-latitude (i.e., summer insolation) processes.

   RELATIONSHIP
AB The need to reduce the uncertainty of predictions of vegetation change under global warming highlights the importance of understanding the vegetation patterns and possible mechanisms of vegetation response during past warming intervals. Here, we present quantitative regional vegetation reconstructions for China during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, 18 +/- 2 C-14 kyr B.P.), early Holocene (EH, 8.5 +/- 0.5 C-14 kyr B.P.), and mid Holocene (MH, 6 +/- 0.5 C-14 kyr B.P.), using the biomization method and based on 249 pollen records. In addition, we used an inverse vegetation modeling approach to investigate the effect of climate change and CO2 concentration on the observed vegetation changes. The results demonstrate that during the LGM, steppe expanded southeastwards, reaching the present-day temperate deciduous forest (TEDE) zone; in contrast, the forest in eastern China underwent a substantial southward retreat and its percentage reached a minimum. The warm mixed forest (WAMF) and TEDE shifted southwards of similar to 10 degrees N relative to today, and tropical seasonal rain forest (TSFO) was almost absent. In addition, the forest-steppe boundary shifted southwards to near the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. During the EH and MH, the TSFO, WAMF, and TEDE exhibited respective northward shifts of 2 degrees, 4 degrees and 5 degrees relative to today. In MH, the percentage of forest sites increased and reached a maximum, and the forest-steppe boundary had shifted northwestwards to near the present-day 300 mm isohyet. Our palaeovegetation reconstructions and model sensitivity experiments suggest that temperature was the dominant factor controlling the vegetation distribution during the LGM, while precipitation became increasingly more important during the Holocene throughout China. We further show that precipitation was the primary factor controlling palaeovegetation distribution in northern China, while temperature became increasingly more important in southern China. Our findings are potentially important for understanding the evolution of vegetation in China in response to ongoing global warming.

AB A U-Pb isotope system of detrital zircons was used to determine the provenance and maximum deposition age of the Paleoproterozoic Mikhailovka and the Ediacaran Khomolkho, Aunakit and Dogaldyn Formations in the Baikal-Patom Highlands, one of the most ancient components of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB). The Baikal-Patom area hosts the world-class Lena orogenic gold province with total endowment of up to 6000 tons Au. The gold deposits are confined to the compressional syn- or post -metamorphic structures at various strati graphic levels in Paleoproterozoic to Neoproterozoic black shale sequences deposited in the Bodaibo passive margin of the Siberian platform. Nine samples were collected from mineralized rocks to address possible detrital zircon recrystallization and transformation during superimposed metamorphic and hydrothermal events. Zircon was analyzed using laser ablation - single collector - magnetic sectorfield - inductively coupled plasma - mass spectrometry (LA-SF-ICP-MS).
   The Mikhailovka metasediments yielded three concordant isotopic age clusters: predominant Archean (2.45-3.25 Ga), Paleoproterozoic (1.96-2.10 Ga), and Cambrian-Ediacaran-Cryogenian (524-702 Ma), whereas most of the zircon grains yielded discordant isotopic ages. Multiple lines of evidence (i.e., grain morphologies, specific set of mineral inclusions, distinctly high U and Th in zircon, and several persistent Pb-loss arrays of discordant ages with lower intercepts of concordia line at closely the same point) suggest the youngest cluster combines formerly metamict zircon of different ancient ages recrystallized under the peak conditions of the regional metamorphic event synchronous with or slightly preceding mineralization. Therefore, the youngest detrital grain isotopic age of 1961 +/- 20 Ma determines the maximum depositional age of the Mikhailovka sediments that predates the emplacement of the Paleoproterozoic collisional Chuya-Nechera granitoids.
   Zircon grains from these granitoids represent a major population in the overlying Ediacaran sequences that indicate the prevalence of supply from proximal local sources, such as the uplifts of the ancient Siberian basement within the Bodaibo paleobasin. The age span of the Neoproterozoic detrital zircon population (604-966 Ma) in the younger formations is in agreement with the events in the CAOB and Siberian platform.

AB A similar to 2200-year moisture history of the southern Altai Mountains (i.e., Chinese Altai) was established based on peat delta C-13(celluose) data obtained at Yushenkule (YSKL) Peat. Generally speaking, the moisture record from YSKL Peat exhibits a "cool-wet" DACP (Dark Age Cold Period from similar to 500 to similar to 800 CE), a "warm-dry" MWP (Medieval Warm Period from similar to 800 to similar to 1200 CE), a "cool-wet" LIA (Little Ice Age from similar to 1200 to similar to 1900 CE), and a "warm-dry" CWP (Current Warm Period since similar to 1900 CE). But, RWP (Roman Warm Period from prior to similar to 100 CE to similar to 500 CE) is an exception (i.e., "warm-wet"). If the heat-water combinations within those major temperature-change events are further examined, the "warm-dry/cool-wet" generalization collapses. The comparisons between the variations in the peat delta C-13(celluose)-based moisture obtained from YSKL Peat and the variations of reconstructed climatic variables in the referenced sequences suggest that the moisture variations in the Altai Mountains have been basically controlled by the precipitation that was primarily modulated by the NAO variations.

AB The deltaic and lacustrine sediments, respectively in the syn- and post- rift stages, are recorded during the Cretaceous at the Wulan-Hua Sag, Erlian Basin, Inner Mongolia. In this study, the Mesozoic depositional system and sequence stratigraphic framework are recognized in the Wulan-Hua sag using core, well-log and seismic data. Five sedimentary facies have been identified including fan-delta, braided delta, shallow-lacustrine, deep-lacustrine, and sublacustrine-fan during Cretaceous at the Wulan-Hua Sag. One first-order sequence (MSQ1), three second-order sequences (SSQ1, SSQ2, and SSQ3), and five third-order sequences (SQl, SQ2, SQ3, SQ4, and SQ5) are classified by subaerial unconformities along the basin margins and correlative conformities in the central part of the basin. During the depositional period of SQl, SQ2, and SQ3, the depocenter controlled by lake-level fluctuations migrated from southern to northern part companying with multiple- to single-provenance supplies. The characteristics of sedimentary facies and sequence stratigraphy in the Wulan-Hua sag are commonly controlled by faults, provenance and depocenters. The development of the third-order sequences is dominated by tectonism and sediment supplies, as well as lake-level changes driven by climate. The favorable targets for hydrocarbon located in the lowstand system tract of SQl, SQ2 and SQ3 at the southern parts of the Wulan-Hua Sag.

AB We present the results of rock magnetic and SEM/EDX analyses of the sediments of Lop Nur, a former saline lake in the Tarim Basin, China. The aim of the study was to assess the impacts of authigenic iron sulfide minerals (e.g., greigite) on the sedimentary magnetic properties and their possible relationship with environmental and climate change. Five layers with relatively high values of chi, chi(ARM), SIRM, S-ratio, chi(ARM)/chi and SIRM/chi are identified within organic-rich sediments; the five layers are dated to ca. 8150-7000, 5300-4900, 3600-3100, 2750-2550 and 1820-1680 cal. yr BP. Authigenic greigite is the dominant magnetic mineral within the five layers and it is present in the stable single domain state. The magnetic properties of the intervening layers are dominated by detrital multidomain magnetite. Combined with results of a previous study, we infer that the greigite-bearing sediments were deposited during cold and wet periods which were probably related to the North Atlantic cold events during the past 8400 yr. During these periods, greigite formation was likely driven by an enhanced organic matter supply, but pyritization was constrained by the decreased sulfate content and high sedimentation rate. The greigite and its diagnostic magnetic parameters (e.g., SIRM/chi) can be regarded as an indicator of the hydrological and climatic evolution of the Tarim Basin.

TI Melting of the Meso-Neoproterozoic juvenile crust for the origin of the

AB The Yangmugou deposit is a representative Late Triassic Mo deposit in South Qinling, central China. The geochronology and geochemistry of the ore-forming (porphyritic) monzogranite and barren dacite in the Yangmugou deposit are analyzed to infer the petrogenesis of the magmatic rocks and metallogenic dynamics. The dacite has a zircon U-Pb age of 211.7 +/- 2.1 Ma, in accordance with the ages of the (porphyritic) monzogranite and Mo mineralization, suggesting that Mo mineralization and magmatic activity occurred in the Late Triassic. The ore-forming (porphyritic) monzogranite exhibits low Mg-# and Sr/Y values, LREE enrichment, HREE depletion, and significantly negative Eu anomalies. Additionally, the (Sr-87/Sr-86)(i) ratios of monzogranite range from 0.7053 to 0.7059 and epsilon Nd(t) values of -3.73 to -3.6. The ((206)pb/(204)pb)(i), ((207)pb/(204)pt)(i) and (Pb-208/Pb-204)(i) values of monzogranite are 17.143-17.517, 15.453-15.781 and 37.318-37.981, respectively. These geochemical characteristics show that the monzogranite is a highly fractionated I-type granite that originated from the melting of Meso-Neoproterozoic juvenile crust. The barren dacite exhibits enriched LREEs, and features high Sr contents and Sr/Y ratios, indicating that the rock can be classified as adakite. Furthermore, the (Sr-87/Sr-86)(i) values of dacite range from 0.7052 to 0.7055, epsilon Nd(t) values of -2.25 to -2.49, and epsilon Hf(t) values of -1.0 to 5.0. The Sr-Nd-Hf isotopic features and high Mg-# values, Cr contents and Th/Ce ratios indicate that the dacite was generated by the interaction between subducted continental crustal-derived adakitic melts and the mantle wedge.
   The regional geological features indicate that the closure of the Paleo-Tethys Ocean caused the collision between the North China Plate and the Yangtze Block in Late Triassic. This event resulted in crustal thickening in South Qinling and caused partial melting of the subducted continental lower crust of the Yangtze Block, forming a primitive adakitic melt. The ascending primitive adakitic melt reacted with the overlying mantle, forming the high-Mg-# adakitic dacite. Furthermore, the asthenospheric upwelling caused by the Late Triassic breakoff of the oceanic slab triggered the partial melting of Meso-Neoproterozoic juvenile crust, forming the low-Mg-#, highly fractionated Mo-bearing (porphyritic) monzogranite. In addition, the Late Triassic Yangmugou ore-forming (porphyritic) monzogranite and barren dacite formed under local stress relaxation or in a local extensional environment during the collision between the North China Plate and the Yangtze Block.

AB Water influences the physics and chemistry of magmatic differentiation because it reduces the melting point, decreases melt viscosity, modifies phase equilibria, and controls how latent heat is released. Here, we explore how compositional trends of fractionating magmas can be used to evaluate the amount of water in the crystallizing system. Of interest is the role of water in generating silicic magmas such as granites and rhyolites. Water expands the crystallization window over which silicic melts are stable, such that granites are limited to small residual melt fractions (F < 0.2) under dry conditions but stable over a wider range of residual melt fractions (F < 0.6) at high water contents. Variations of SiO2 versus F are relatively insensitive to oxygen fugacity and can be used as a hygrometer for granitoids, where F is estimated through relative enrichments in incompatible elements, such as Th and K. We also show that generation of granitoids in arc environments follow distinctly different Mg#-SiO2 trends compared with anorogenic or intra-plate granites. We confirm that arc magmas differentiate at higher water contents and possibly higher oxygen fugacities than anorogenic/intra-plate magmas. Finally, Archean TTGs (tonalite, trondhjemite, and granodiorite) show similar Mg#-SiO2 systematics as Phanerozoic arc-related granitoids, suggesting similar petrogenetic physical and chemical conditions.

AB The mineral assemblages of lacustrine mixed sediments have vital significance for reconstructing paleo-lake environments, and typical lacustrine mixed sediments deposited during the Eocene are distributed throughout the Yingxi area in the western Qaidam Basin. Accordingly, the framboid size distributions and sulfur isotope (delta(34)(py)) characteristics of pyrite in addition to the carbon isotope (delta C-13(carb)) characteristics and redox-sensitive element ratios (Th/U, V/(V + Ni) and V/Cr) of authigenic carbonates were investigated to reconstruct the high frequency redox variations in cyclic lacustrine sediments.
   Corresponding to different redox conditions, three types of mixed sediments developed during transgression and regression stages within the saline basin in the Yingxi area during the Eocene: mixed terrigenous clasts formed in oxic-dysoxic water column conditions during lake transgression, mixed carbonates formed in anoxic water column conditions during early-stages lake regression, and mixed evaporites formed in anoxic-sulfidic water column conditions during middle-late-stage lake regression. The redox proxies correlate well with the water salinity, exhibit little or no correlation with the water temperature, and show an incongruity with the water depth, suggesting that the redox conditions were predominantly controlled by the water salinity rather than the water depth or temperature. Therefore, based on the water redox condition variations and the salinity, three dynamic formation models of the high-frequency sedimentary cycles in a saline basin are established: a deep-water, low-salinity, oxic-dysoxic model (Model I, a medium-water, medium-salinity, anoxic model (Model II) and a shallow-water, high-salinity, anoxic-sulfidic model (Model III). Because the climate gradually turned dry and hot from lake transgression to regression, the continued closure of the basin enhanced evaporation and salinization. In addition, mixed terrigenous clasts, mixed carbonates and mixed evaporites deposited successively. Correspondingly, salinity stratification gradually developed within the lake water, increasing the extent of bacterial sulfate reduction in the bottom water.

AB In this study, the Gravity Field and Steady-State Ocean Circulation Explorer (GOCE) gravitational gradients in the North China Craton (NCC) are processed. The normal gravitational gradient correction, the downward continuation from the mean orbit altitude to the geoid, and the gravitational gradient corrections for the topography, sediment, Moho undulations and the deep-source field are taken into account. After processing, the residual gravitational gradient anomalies corresponding to density heterogeneities are acquired. The preconditioned conjugate gradient method is introduced to invert the density structures using the roughness matrix to constrain the density distribution and the depth-weighting function to prevent the density distribution from migrating to the top of the model due to the decay of the gravitational gradient kernel with depth. The density structure derived from the seismic tomography is used as the initial model, and the GOCE gravitational gradient anomalies are used to invert the density structures in the NCC using the preconditioned conjugate gradient method. The results show that the density structures of the NCC lithosphere reflect obvious lateral and vertical heterogeneities. The density structure in the eastern part of the NCC is different from that in the western part of the NCC. The distribution of the density anomalies corresponds to the tectonic characteristics. The density structures in Taihang Mountain exhibit segmentation features. The thinning of the lithosphere observed in the NCC may extend into the northern part of Taihang Mountain. The density changes significantly within the area between the Ordos Block and the Qilian Block, which corresponds with the different lithospheric features in these two blocks.

AB In this study, we have investigated the association of stress-field disparities through earthquake production rate in both spatially and temporally for Northeast region of India. Here, we have implemented the rate and state dependent friction law for forecasting the seismicity rate over M-w >= 5.0 earthquake events during the period 2013-2015. The most valuable input model parameter of forecasting seismicity rate is Coulomb stresses changes (Delta CFF), which promote the seismicity rate. The Delta CFF distributions that exhibit significant stress increase in the close proximity of the mainshock sources are found to be diminished with the inverse of the distance from the fault rupture plane. Basically, background seismicity depends on the Coulomb stress changes. These Coulomb stress changes amplify the background seismicity, so a little change in stress can produce very low or high seismicity rate in areas of high ambient seismicity. In several zones the high seismicity rate is revealed by the dominancy of the low b-value. The observed background seismicity rate lies between the ranges of 0-4.0. The significant b-value is achieved in the range of 0.57-1.54 along with average value of 0.93. We have taken the value of constant consecutive parameters (i.e. A sigma = 0.05 MPa) and constant effective friction coefficient of mu' = 0.4 for all the faults. However, in the forecast model we have obtained the stress perturbations and heterogeneous b-value to infer the reliable result in comparison to reference forecast model for the period of 1963-2012. In this study, we have also adopted the RELM experiment in CSEP testing Centre to verify the consistency of the result related to forecast for the duration of 2013-2015. The statistical test provided the satisfactory result for this study region.

AB Majority of the aeolian deposits that are widely distributed throughout the low-latitudes during the Cretaceous have been considered to be the result of downdraft influence controlled by the subtropical high-pressure belt. However, a lack of relevant fossil material has hindered both the chronostratigraphic framework of these deposits and the reconstruction of their corresponding palaeoenvironments. This study presents detailed palynological records from two drillcores through the Lower Cretaceous Canxi and Bailong formations in the Sichuan Basin, Southwest China. Classopollis pollen, followed by the bisaccate conifer pollen, together with other rare types of palynomorph dominate the palynological assemblages that are recorded within. Some age-diagnostic palynomorphs, especially Dicheiropollis, indicate an age of Valanginian to Hauterivian for the Cangxi and Bailong formations. Classopollis-dominated palynoflora indicate an extremely dry climate for this part of the history of the Sichuan Basin region. In addition, the occurrence of Dicheiropollis indicates that the Sichuan Basin should belong to the Dicheiropollis Province that surrounds the Tethys Ocean, which implies that the Tethys Ocean may have exhibited a stronger climatic impact on the Sichuan Basin regions as compared to that exhibited by the Pacific Ocean.

AB The Bayan Obo deposit is the largest rare-earth element (REE) deposit in the world. In this deposit, ore bodies are hosted in fine-grained ore-bearing dolomite marbles, known as the H8 dolomite marble. The H8 dolomite marble has been considered as part of the Bayan Obo Group composed Paleoproterozoic sedimentary rocks. However, the H8 dolomite marble can be younger than the Bayan Obo Group, and thus, the genesis of the dolomite marble should be re-examined. In this paper, we describe petrography and compositions of the H8 dolomite marble. The dolomite marbles generally have high FeO, MnO and SrO contents, different from sedimentary limestone or dolostone but similar to dolomite carbonatites. In composition, they can be grouped into magnesio-carbonatite and ferro-carbonatite. Texturally they are porphyritic and comprise originally hypabyssal intrusions. It is thus proposed that carbonatitic magmas injected slowly into a magma chamber where they have undergone fractionation to produce evolved dolomite-carbonatite magmas rich in alkali, REE, Fe and volatile components. Such evolved, metal-rich magmas were consequently injected along the contact zone between the early dolomite carbonatite sill and other layer of the Bayan Obo Group, and produced an large fenitization aureole enclosing ores rich in Fe, Nb, REE, F and alkali metals. Changes in CO2/H2O ratios, oxygen fugacity and halogen content of fluids were responsible for the formation of different types of ore, including massive magnetite-rich, aegirine-rich and Na-amphibole-rich ores. Considering the fact that the ore bodies are located at the place where dolomite carbonatites are relatively thick and the fenitization is relatively extensive, we speculate that the ore formation was genetically related to extensive fenitization involving exsolution of large amounts of fluids and subsequently extensive metasomatism. It is concluded that carbonatitic magmas played a major role in the formation of the REE mineralization in the Bayan Obo deposit.

AB The Liuqu Conglomerate, exposed along the Yarlung Zangbo suture zone (YZSZ) in southern Tibet, archives not only the process of the India-Asia collision, but also the exhumation history of the India-Asia collision zone. The burial and exhumation history of the Liuqu Conglomerate thus could potentially provide clues to the India-Asia collision and orogeny. Low-temperature thermochronometric data indicate that maximum burial temperatures of the Liuqu Conglomerate ranged from 80 to 110 degrees C; however, the exact burial history is not well constrained. Here, we examine the burial conditions of the Liuqu Conglomerate by applying dumped isotope thermometry to paleosol carbonates. Extensive microcrystalline recrystallization indicates that the samples have been diagenetically altered during burial. Moreover, the clumped isotope temperatures (ranging from similar to 48 to similar to 97 degrees C) are clearly above Earth surface conditions, indicating the original climatic information was overwritten by alteration at higher burial temperatures. Nevertheless, the calculated diagenetic water delta O-18 values represent maximum meteoric water values that can be used to broadly constrain the paleoelevation. The highest clumped isotope temperature implies that the maximum burial temperature of the Liuqu Conglomerate was at least similar to 97 degrees C. We conclude that the Liuqu Conglomerate was buried as deeply as 3.7-4.3 km during the latest Paleocene to Eocene, and then exhumed during the Miocene (similar to 10-12 Ma). Incision of the paleo-Yarlung River was likely responsible for erosion and exhumation of the Liuqu Conglomerate, which suggests that the drainage system of Paleo-Yarlung River was similar to that of today and supports the model of outward growth of the Tibetan Plateau.

AB Chemical weathering of continents is one of the major geochemical processes which consumes atmospheric CO2 and exerts a strong impact on the global climate. The major ion chemistry of the Mahanadi river basin, one of the largest river basins in India, is determined to investigate the sources of major ions and their spatio-temporal variability, chemical weathering rates and associated CO2 consumption in the basin. The results reveal that the ions in the basin are dominated by Ca and HCO3. The total dissolved solids (215 mg L-1 in monsoon and 270 mg L-1 in pre-monsoon) and total cation concentration (2367 mu Eq in monsoon and 3214 mu Eq in pre-monsoon) in the basin are relatively higher than the global average. The dissolved loads in the basin are dominantly controlled by rock weathering particularly chemical weathering of silicates and carbonates. The estimated chemical weathering rates based on the forward model are 44.94 t km(-2) yr(-1) in monsoon and 2.45 t km(-2) yr(-1) in pre-monsoon with annual average chemical weathering rate of 23.7 t km(-2) yr(-1). The contribution of silicate weathering rates in the basin is 32 and 1.55 t km(-2) y(-1) during monsoon and pre-monsoon period respectively. The estimated CO2 consumption rate associated with chemical weathering in the basin is 13.3 x 10(5) mol km(-2) yr(-1) during monsoon and 0.66 x 10(5) mol km-2 yr(-1) during pre-monsoon period with an average annual rate of 6.9 x 10(5) mol km(-2) yr(-1) which is higher than the global average. The net rate of CO2 consumption by silicate weathering is estimated to be approximately 4.78 x 10(5) mol km(-2) yr(-1). It is observed that the runoff and lithology are the major factors influencing chemical weathering in the basin. However, the basin elevation has a good negative correlation with chemical weathering rate.

AB Mantle xenoliths are scattered in alkali basalt in central and southern Vietnam. The xenoliths from Ia Bang, Pleiku plateau, consist of fertile spinel Iherzolites and refractory spinel harzburgites. The spinel peridotites display varying textures from protogranular through porphyroclastic to equigranular. Primitive mantle-normalized rare earth elements (REE) of clinopyroxene in the peridotites reveal depleted, spoon-shaped, and enriched patterns, suggesting a depletion event followed by various enrichment processes. The correlation between (Yb)n and (Y)n of clinopyroxene in spinel peridotites indicates that the subcontinental lithospheric mantle (SCLM) beneath Ia Bang has been affected by 1-20% fractional melting. The presence of glass and secondary clinopyroxene, coupled with the enrichment of light REEs (LREEs), high field strength elements (HFSEs), and large ion lithophile elements (LILEs) without introductions of new minerals suggests that the xenoliths underwent cryptic metasomatism. Metasomatic agents were identified as Na-alkali silicate, carbonate-rich melts, and H2O-CO2 fluids. The peridotites were at equilibrium temperatures of 841-1131 degrees C before being brought up by alkali basalt from depths of 36 to 50 km. The SCLM beneath Ia Bang experienced a thinning process in which the refractory lithosphere was thinned and replaced by asthenosphere during the Phanerozoic, following the asthenosphere-lithospheric interaction.

AB Eolian systems were widespread in China in the Cretaceous. However, the reports of pre-Cretaceous eolian and its related systems are scarce, which prohibits studying the construction, accumulation and preservation of eolian systems as well as its allogenic and autogenic controlling factors. In this paper, we report on fluvial-eolian successions from the Late Jurassic Tianchihe Formation in the Ningwu-Jingle Basin. These successions represent the oldest reported inland fluvial-eolian systems in China. Fourteen lithofacies types are recognized in the Tianchihe Formation and have been grouped into six facies associations, including meandering fluvial channel, levee and overbank in the lower part, and eolian sandsheet, eolian dune, ephemeral fluvial channel and floodplain in the upper part. The fluvial system comprises a series of wetting upward cycles, which indicate humid climate culminating in high precipitation and shallow water table level. Eolian dune deposits composed of grainflow, grainfall, wind ripple strata and pin stripe laminations currently implies that all deposits types are internally bounded by reactivation surface and superimposition surface, suggesting compound dunes or drags. Eolian sandsheet deposits consist dominantly of subcritical climbing translatent strata and pin stripe lamination. The association of eolian dune and eolian sandsheet is development of a dry eolian system. Twelve drying upward cycles mainly composed of eolian sandsheet-eolian dune successions and four wetting upward cycles consisting of eolian sandsheet/dune-ephemeral fluvial channel/floodplain successions occur in the eolian system. These repeated cycles likely reflect an evolving erg system directly controlled by sediment supply, sediment availability and relative water table. The vertical transition from fluvial to eolian systems indicate a local climatic oscillation from relatively humid to arid conditions, which may be related with the uplift of the East China Plateau in the Late Jurassic.

AB In this paper, we present in situ zircon U-Pb ages as well as whole-rock elemental and Sm-Nd isotopic compositions for late Archean sanukitoids of the Bundelkhand Craton, India. The LA-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb dating results of the sanukitoids (s.l.) indicate that these rocks were emplaced at 2577 +/- 16 Ma, with inherited zircon at an age of 2644 +/- 25 Ma, and are coeval with high-K anatectic granites (2544-2583 Ma). The sanukitoids (s.l.) are characterized by high-alumina (1516 wt.%), Mg# (2750) and TiO2 (0.31-0.87 wt.%). They have a strongly enriched signature in terms of incompatible trace elements (LREEs and LILE) pointing to a subduction-related or crustal source. The high-K anatectic granites are characterized by Al2O3 (1215 wt.%), Mg# (1339) and TiO2 (0.06-0.8 wt.%); they have enriched and variable concentrations of LILEs and REEs; and negative Eu anomalies (Eu/Eu* = 0.15-0.93). The whole-rock epsilon(Nd)(t) values (-3.64 to -1.66) indicate a crustal component. These isotopic and geochemical characteristics indicate that the sanukitoid plutons originated from the mixing of metasomatized mantle melts with anatectic melts and were followed by homogenization at shallow levels of emplacement, whereas the high-K anatectic granites indicate reworking of the pre-existing TTG crust during the cratonic stabilization ca. 2.5 Ga. This interpretation suggests a temporal evolution from TTG-domination through sanukitoids (s.l.) to anatectic leucogranites by an internal reworking of the continental crust, involving subduction-collision environments in the late Archean era. Such magmatic events and tectonics during the late-Archean in the Bundelkhand Craton resemble other Archean cratons, such as the Dharwar, North China, Karelian, Superior Province, Pilbara, Kaapvaal and Amazonian.

AB Determining the physical conditions and material properties of low-grade (sub-green schist fades) deformation accurately is problematic due to the lack of adequate strain indicators and mineral equilibrium assemblages with established relationships to pressure and temperature conditions. For low-grade deformation, proxies such as illite crystallinity are often used to provide broad constraints on these conditions. The relationship between illite crystallinity and temperature remains qualitative, however, it has been suggested that illite crystallinity may be a more appropriate proxy for tectonic strain at low temperatures. Recent work on an exposed shale detachment zone in the Khao Khwang Fold-Thrust Belt has described strain partitioning into shale-dominated "shear domains" which delineate coarser-grained "fault domains". This strain partitioning is a key influence in the development of the complex three-dimensional shear zone networks which characterise the multiple shale detachment zones in the area. Here we apply both the Fry Method of finite strain analysis and illite crystallinity by X-ray diffraction analysis to examine the potential strain variations between different shear and fault domains. Shear domains show less variable and "higher-grade" illite crystallinity values, while the Fry Method results show higher strain values in these shear domains. This is confirmed by QEMSCAN mineral mapping of each domain type, where shear domains show a far more developed tectonic fabric, indicating a much higher degree of strain is accommodated continually throughout these relatively thin shear zones. The fault domains they delineate, by contrast, show far less internal strain, which is accommodated discontinuously by discrete, low offset, fault planes. Data from our results also show a remarkably strong correlation between illite crystallinity and finite strain, and while the small number of samples involved in this study leads us to caution the over interpretation of these results, it points to a strong relationship between illite crystallinity and finite strain at low temperatures. If further investigated and quantified, this relationship could provide a powerful and inexpensive tool for strain determination in fine-grained rocks.

AB Himalayan deformation substantially impacts the hydrocarbon migration and accumulation in the western Qaidam Basin. In order to investigate how the Himalayan deformation influences the hydrocarbon migration and accumulation in fracture type reservoir, we took Shizigou oil field in the western Qaidam Basin as an example and studied the Himalayan deformation history based on the results from the balanced cross-section restoration of 2 sections across the Shizigou oil filed at first. Then we simulated the fluid potential of one particular section at different tectonic episodes by the numerical method to investigate how the Himalayan deformation effects on it. We conclude that the Himalayan deformation influences the hydrocarbon migration and accumulation in three aspects. Firstly, the faults which form during the structural evolution and communicate with the source rock can act as the primary pathways for the hydrocarbon migration. Secondly, the fracturing of rocks occurs during structural evolution owing to significant compression, which prefer occurring near the faults especially in hanging wall and the hinge zone of folds. These fractures significantly improve the permeability of the rock and result in good pathways for hydrocarbon migration and high-quality reservoirs for hydrocarbon accumulation. Thirdly, influenced by tectonic deformation, compaction of rock bulk volume generates the rising of fluid potential in the soft formation where fracturing is restricted, in contrast, expansion of rock bulk volume generates the chopping of fluid potential in the position where fracturing is enhanced. The change of fluid potential allows the hydrocarbon to migrate and accumulate rapidly along the faults where low fluid potential occurs attributed to fracturing. The impact of tectonic deformation on the hydrocarbon migration and accumulation results in that the hydrocarbon accumulates in fracture type reservoirs near the faults.

AB The Nallihan and Carrhan regions in western Anatolia host the stratigraphically and tectonically important features of Nallihan Wedge. The stratigraphic relationships and structural architecture of the wedge are not well understood, which are essential for better understanding of the timing and tectonic evolution of western Anatolia. Today, the Nallihan Wedge is bounded by the North Anatolian Fault and the Thrace-Eskisehir Fault in the northwest and southwest, respectively. The existence of Dagkuplu Melange within the wedge represents the closure of the Izmir-Ankara Ocean. The occurrence of the Lower Jurassic shelf, slope, reef and deep sea successions transitioning upward into the Cretaceous shelf and slope successions represent the opening and closing cycles of the Intra-Pontide Ocean. The tight and asymmetric folds (steep in the west, gentle in the east) within this stratigraphic sequence and the development of the Eocene units reflect the closure of the Intra-Pontide and izmir-Ankara oceans. The geometric structure and evolution of the Nallihan Wedge is directly related to the final continental collision. W-E and SW-NE striking large-scale oblique thrusts also exhibit notable strike-slip components within the study area. The principal direction of the fold axes are W-E and WNW-ESE oriented for the Eocene and Neogene units. During the Eocene, the depositional environment of the study area was a ramp basin mainly dominated by a braided river, when a portion of the Intra-Pontide Ocean was situated on the northern side of the study area. The compressional tectonic regime continued to the end of the Oligocene, which is followed by a new tectonic regime during the Miocene, when the triangular shape region between the Thrace Eskisehir Fault and the North Anatolian Fault developed as an intermontane basin. The evolution of this basin can be compared with the Tercan Wedge, bordered by the North Eastern Anatolian Fault and the North Anatolian Fault.
   In the Nallihan and Cayirhan regions the N-S-trending compressional regime started during the Upper Cretaceous and continued until the final continental collisional during the Upper Eocene. The compressional structures in the area became reactivated during the post-collisional escape tectonic phase in western Anatolia, leading to the development of the prominent Isparta Angle during the Miocene. During this period, the Thrace Eskisehir Fault and Burdur-Fethiye Shear Zone also formed as intracontinental transform fault zones in western Anatolia. The Nallihan Wedge started to form in a wedge-shaped area between the Thrace-Eskisehir Fault and the zone of strike-slip faults with thrust component that later developed into the North Anatolian Fault. Thus, Eocene and pre-Eocene structures obtain strike-slip component by an inversion during the Miocene. During and post Pliocene, the Thrace-Eskisehir Fault lost its tectonic activity as the North Anatolian Fault propagated westward into the region previously controlled by the Thrace-Eskisehir Fault. During this interval the Nallihan Wedge entered a new stage of deformation, which is also observed today.

AB The Zaribar Lake is situated along the Main Recent Fault, a dextral major strike-slip active fault system in the Zagros collision zone. The formation of the Zaribar Lake in Late Pleistocene is associated with the activities of the Main Zagros Reverse Fault, initiated in Late Oligocene, and with the Main Recent Fault, whose inception occurred about 5 Ma ago. Metamorphic, intrusive and ophiolitic rocks in the Zagros suture zone are affected by a normal fault system in the Zaribar area. Geometry and kinematics of these normal faults indicate that the Zaribar Lake is generated in a releasing zone. The strike of the Main Recent Fault varies from 300 degrees to 330 degrees along the Marivan fault segment. The releasing bend of the Marivan Fault around the Zaribar Lake has resulted in the extensional deformation by which the lake has been downdropped between two strike-slip faults. Besides the extensional mechanism of the main right-lateral strike-slip faults that has resulted in the formation of the Zaribar as a large-scale pull-apart basin, minor strike-slip faults have also produced specific landforms around the lake. Small-scale normal faults and large scale grabens developed around the lake are geological indicators of extensional areas. Geomorphological evidence also support the pull-apart origin for the Zaribar Lake. Beheaded rivers, numerous offsets in drainage system, half-broom shaped drainage pattern, sag ponds with different scales, linear and strike-parallel valleys and alluvial fan with high sweep angle and width/length ratio confirm the movements along right-lateral, strike slip faults around the Zaribar.

AB An exposure created by excavation of a trench across the Himalayan Frontal Thrust provides the basis to interpret that a single earthquake produced vertical separation of similar to 7 m at Khayarmara, a small community similar to 80 km southwest of Kathmandu. The fault trace at Khayarmara is expresssed by a topographic ridge resulting from folding up-dip and toward the surface at the expense of greater fault slip taking place at depth. Structure, stratigraphy, and radiocarbon data are interpreted to indicate displacement occurred after about 1050 CE to 1200 CE. The timing and displacement at Khayarmara are compared to that reported previously at six contiguous sites that extend from 200 km to the west and 250 km to the east of Khayarmara, respectively. The comparison leads us to conclude that the surface rupture at Khayarmara was part of a >= 250 km long synchronous surface rupture earthquake of magnitude approaching if not surpassing Mw 9. We observe in the exposure no record of surface rupture associated with the great 1934 Bihar-Nepal earthquake.

TI Resistivity characterization of the Arjuno-Welirang volcanic geothermal
   system (Indonesia) through 3-D Magnetotelluric inverse modeling

   Volcanic geothermal system
ID 3-DIMENSIONAL INVERSION
AB The Arjuno-Welirang geothermal area is located in East Java, Indonesia. In the Arjuno-Welirang geothermal area, the Arjuno, Welirang and Anjasmoro volcanic complex is dominated by quaternary volcanic rocks and a complex geological structure. Several impressive surface thermal manifestations are found in the study area, including a high temperature solfataric-fumarole (about 137 degrees C) on the top of Mt. Welirang and also bicarbonate hot springs with a temperature range of 39-55 degrees C in the northern and western parts of the study area. The occurrences of the surface manifestations are probably controlled by the NW-SE and NNE-SSW fault structures. The occurrence of the high temperature solfataric-fumarole with high magmatic gas contents indicates that the Arjuno-Welirang geothermal area can be classified as a volcanic geothermal system. To investigate the subsurface condition of the geothermal system, Magnetotelluric (MT) survey was conducted within 34 MT stations distributed in the northern and western parts of the study area. Considering the complexity of the subsurface volcanic rocks and the geological structures of the study area, one and two-dimensional MT data inversion approaches could not be applied properly. Accordingly, a 3-D inversion of the MT data will be the most representative approach in such conditions in order to investigate the reservoir structure of the volcanic geothermal system. The 3-D inversion was then applied to all MT data with a frequency range of 100-0.01 Hz. Generally, the quality of the MT data varies from good to excellent. A clear subsurface resistivity structure revealed by the 3-D inversion showed a good correlation with geological and geochemical evidences. Overall, the resistivity structure consists of a conductive (1-10 ohm m) altered rock at the upper part overlying a reservoir zone with a slightly higher resistivity range (20-60 ohm m). The lower part of the resistivity structure showed the highest resistivity value (> 80 ohm m), indicating a hot rock region. The main upflow is represented by an updome structure of the base of the conductive layer (BOC) beneath the Mt Welirang summit. It is supported by the occurrence of solfataric-fumaroles on the summit of Mt Welirang. Moreover, the outflow zones of the Arjuno-Welirang geothermal system are indicated by a thickening of the low resistivity layer toward the northern and western parts of Mt. Welirang supported with the occurrence of bicarbonate hotsprings. The existence of magmatic gas components (i.e. H2S and SO2) detected in the fumarole, gives an early warning regarding the possible existence of acidic fluid. Further exploration drilling should consider this issue. A conceptual model is then developed to visualize the geothermal system of the Arjuno-Welirang prospect area by integrating the geological and geochemical data.

AB In the eastern side of the Malay Peninsula, thick successions of limestone formations preserve important records of the Mesozoic and Cenozoic tectonic events. Here we investigate the strata- and fracture-bound hydrothermal dolomites in the Palaeozoic carbonates of the Kinta Valley, western Peninsular Malaysia. Based on their textural and morphologic characteristics, structural relationships with the host rock, different facies types, and associations with hydrothermal calcite and low-grade metamorphic marble, we attempt to trace their polyphase origin and relationship with thereto-tectonic events of the region. A detailed evaluation of the nature of brecciation and crystallization of polyphase dolomites, dolomitic limestones, limestones and marble, under the influences of episodic faulting, is associated with the regional structural geology with emphasis on pre-existing fault reactivations, granitic emplacement and progressive thermal influence. Supply of Mg2+ from the host rock for dolomitization, limited and episodic influx of circulating fluids and cessation of thereto-tectonic evolution with progressive cooling are also inferred. Correlating the geological events in western Peninsular Malaysia with regional structural dynamics reveals that the major deformation episodes exerted first order controls on the loci of dolomite occurrences. The occurrence, geometry and structural relationships of the dolomites were controlled by successive magmatic events, whereas, the intensity of replacement dolomitization was controlled by host rock texture and varied bulk chemistry, together with the nature of circulating fluids.

AB The present study investigates the relics of the most extensive glacier advances and their retreat in the transitional climatic zone of the Chopta valley, northern Sikkim Himalaya with an aim to understand the forcing factors. The optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating of the stratigraphically oldest glacier advance and its retreat in the Chopta valley revealed that the glacier advanced at similar to 28 +/- 2.8 ka and sustained through the global Last Glacial Maximum (gLGM; 26.5 ka and 19 ka; Mix et al., 2001). The deglaciation is manifested by recessional moraine (ridge) dated at similar to 18 +/- 2.2 ka. Comparing the results of the present study with the existing glacial chronologies from the Himalayan region, it has been observed that irrespective of the geographical locations; the intensified mid latitude-westerlies during the gLGM and the associated decrease in winter temperature was the major driver of glacier advance during the MIS-2.

AB FK506 (tacrolimus) is an effective immunosuppressant, but its poor water solubility and low bioavailability impose barriers to ocular drug delivery. The nanomicelles (NMs) formulations comprised of amino-terminated poly(ethylene glycol-block-poly(D, L)-lactic acid) (NH2-PEG-b-PLA) and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) were developed to increase the penetration of hydrophobic drugs in the eye and enhance the drug bioavailability for ocular disorder therapy. Spherical FK506/NH2-PEG-b-PLA/HPMC NMs with mean diameter of 101.4 +/- 1.3 nm were prepared by solvent-evaporation-induced self-assembly in aqueous solution. The NMs that sufficiently solubilized FK506 were evaluated in terms of stability, drug loading, encapsulation efficiency, surface tension, cellular cytotoxicity and in vitro release, and the results revealed the NMs were suitable for intraocular drug delivery. Compared with the 0.05% FK506 suspension drops, the in vitro permeation amount of FK506 from NMs exhibited significant increase. Besides, the higher concentration and longer retention of FK506 in ocular tissue were also confirmed in vivo. Furthermore, the FK506/NH2-PEG-b-PLA/HPMC NMs obviously inhibited the allograft rejection after corneal transplantation in rats. In conclusion, FK506/NH2-PEG-b-PLA/HPMC NMs formulations as a promising ocular drug delivery system would be able to improve the bioavailability and efficacy of FK506 in anti-allograft rejection.

AB In this study, authors adapt the Quality by Design (QbD) concept as well as the Risk Assessment (RA) method to the early development phase of a new nano-sized liposomal formulation for nasal administration with brain target. As a model active agent, a BCS II class drug was chosen to investigate the behaviour of the drugs with lipophilic character. This research presents how to apply this risk-focused approach and concentrates on the first four stages of the QbD implementation. In this way the quality target product profile was defined, the critical factors were identified and an RA was performed. The RA results helped in the factorial design-based liposome preparation by the lipid film hydration method. The prepared liposomes were evaluated (vesicle size, size distribution, and specific surface area). The surface characteristics were also investigated to verify the exactness of the RA and critical factors based theoretical prediction.
   The results confirm that the QbD approach in liposome development can improve the formulation process. The RA focused predictive approach resulted in a decreased number of studies in practice but in an effective product preparation. Using such innovative design and development models can help to optimise and rationalise the development of liposomes.

AB To improve the oral efficiency of insulin, a novel oral insulin delivery system was developed, to protect the insulin from destruction, and to deliver monomeric insulin with higher bioactivity. The oral insulin delivery system was developed by using chitosan/alginate nanoparticles as carriers for the oral delivery of Cp1-11 peptide/insulin complex (Cp1-11 peptide/Insulin Loaded Nanoparticle, CILN). There is a supramolecular interaction between the insulin and the Cp1-11 peptide, which could inhibit insulin aggregation and improve its bioactivity. In vitro release studies showed that the pH-responsive CILN system could retain insulin in a simulated gastric buffer solution, and exhibited sustained release of the insulin in simulated intestinal buffer solution. The stability studies indicated that CILN could also protect insulin against degradation by proteases in the gastrointestinal tract. Moreover, the insulin oral delivery system appeared to show excellent hypoglycemic effect, and led to higher pharmacological availability of insulin, compared with free insulin loaded nanoparticles, in diabetic rats. Thus, this study has suggested that insulin complexed with Cp1-11 peptide, followed by encapsulating in chitosan/alginate nanoparticles, providing an effective strategy for an oral insulin delivery system to treat diabetes in the future.

AB The aim of this paper was to develop hexagonal liquid crystalline (H-II) gels that can be used as a novel ocular delivery system for pilocarpine nitrate (PN). H-II gels were prepared by a vortex method using phytantriol/triglyceride/water (71.15: 3.85: 26, w/w) ternary system. The gels were characterized by crossed polarized light microscopy, small-angle X-ray scattering, differential scanning calorimetry and rheology. And, in vitro drug release behavior and ex vivo corneal permeation were investigated. Finally, preocular residence time evaluation, eye irritation test, histological examination and miotic tests were studied in vivo and compared with carbopol gel. Based on various characterization techniques, the inner structure of the gels were H-II mesophase and exhibited a pseudoplastic fluid behaviour. In vitro release results revealed that PN could be released continuously from H-II gel over a period of 24 h. The ex vivo apparent permeability coefficient of H-II gel was 3.15-fold (P < 0.01) higher than that of the Carbopol gel. Compared with Carbopol gel, H-II gel displayed longer residence time on the eyeballs surface using fluorescent labeling technology. Furthermore, the H-II gel caused no ocular irritation was estimated by corneal hydration levels, Draize test and histological inspection. Additionally, in vivo miotic study showed that H-II gel had a remarkably long-lasting decrease in the pupil diameter of rabbits. In conclusion, H-II gels would be a promising sustained-release formulation for ocular drug delivery.

AB The knowledge and tools to characterise proteins have comprehensively developed in the last two decades. Some of these tools are used in formulation development to select formulation conditions suitable for long-term storage. However, there is an ongoing debate whether the predictions obtained with these tools are in good agreement with the outcome from real-time long-term stability studies. In this work, we investigate whether some of the state-of-the-art microscale, microvolume and non destructive biophysical techniques can be applied to promptly select formulations that minimise the aggregation of interferon alpha2a during storage. Interferon alpha2a was used as a model protein as it is known to form aggregates at concentrations over an order of magnitude higher than used in the commercial product. We apply a systematic formulation approach in which we investigate the effect of pH and ionic strength on protein stability. The predictions from the sample-saving biophysical characterisation are validated by long-term stability studies at 4 degrees C and 25 degrees C for 12 months on selected formulations. Interferon alpha2a shows minimal aggregation in 10 mM sodium acetate buffer with pH 4 and low ionic strength. The latter is indicated by the rapid sample-saving biophysical characterisation and confirmed by the long-term stability data.

AB Non-viral gene delivery vectors studied in the gene therapy applications are often designed with the cationic nitrogen containing groups necessary for binding and cell release of nucleic acids. Disadvantage is a relatively high toxicity which restricts the in vivo use of such nanoparticles. Here we show, that the 3rd generation carbosilane dendrimers possessing (trimethyl) phosphonium (PMe3) groups on their periphery were able to effectively deliver the functional siRNA into the cells (B14, Cricetulus griseus), release it into the cytosol and finally to achieve up to 40% gene silencing of targeted gene (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)) with the comparable or, in some cases, even better effectivity as their ammonium counterparts. Moreover, such cationic dendrimers show relatively low in vivo toxicity as compared to their ammonium analogues when analyzed by standard fish embryo test (FET) on Danio rerio in vivo model, with LD50 = 6.26 mu M after 48 h of incubation. This is more than 10-fold improvement as compared to published values for various other types of cationic dendrimers. We discuss the potential of further increase of the transfection efficiency, endosomal escape and decrease of toxicity of such non-viral vectors, based on the systematic screening of different types of substituents on central phosphonium atom.

AB In view of the high incidence and long-term treatment of dental caries, personalized dental fillers with long therapeutic action have broad application prospects in the dental clinic. The objective of this study was to fabricate and evaluate novel dental fillers using state-of-the-art 3D printing technology. Tinidazole (TNZ), a commonly used antibacterial drug in the dental clinic, was chosen as the model compound. Models of molars with carious cavities were obtained via 3D scanning. TNZ dental fillers were indirectly produced by thermal pressing using customized 3D printed molds. In addition, bio-relevant in vitro dissolution and mechanical testing methods were developed using customized 3D printed release and compression molds, respectively. It was observed that the formability, mechanical properties, and release behavior of the TNZ dental fillers were affected by mold materials, plasticizers, and release modifiers. The developed dental fillers were capable of sustained releasing TNZ over one week. The TNZ release characteristics can be tailored based on clinical requirements by varying hydroxypropyl methylcellulose E5 (HPMC-E5) concentrations and filler dimensions. Moreover, computational simulation based on the finite element method showed that the biomechanical behavior of the TNZ dental fillers met the daily use requirement. The present study demonstrated that the state-of-the-art 3D printing technology can be used to design and fabricate personalized dental fillers with high mechanical strength and "on-demand" drug release characteristics.

AB Self-assembled particles, based on non-covalent interactions, are attractive drug carriers with a relatively simple structure and easy preparation. Tannic acid (TA) is an anionic polyphenolic compound with a wide range of molecular interactions and diverse applications in drug delivery research. Here, we propose the use of TA complexes with cationic antibiotics as a new pH-responsive drug carrier of high drug loading and optimal stability. TA complexes were prepared with three water-soluble antibiotics; colistin sulfate (COL), gentamicin sulfate (GEN) and gatifloxacin (GAT). Complexes' size ranged from several-hundred nanometers to few microns. For selected particles, drug loading ranged from 30 to 36%. Importantly, we demonstrate the impact of drugcarrier interactions, studied via infrared spectroscopy and molecular modeling, on final complex stability and performance; the complexes resisted dissociation in presence of serum at physiological pH to variable degrees and showed different drug release profiles. However, all complexes dissociated upon medium acidification, releasing their drug payload and demonstrating expected antibacterial effect. These results demonstrate that TA/antibiotic self-assembled complexes represent an excellent carrier for pH-sensitive delivery of water-soluble drugs. In addition to system's simplicity and low cost, complexes were easily prepared with high drug loading and desirable pH-dependent association/dissociation profile.

AB Coumestrol is a polyphenol with promising therapeutic applications as phytoestrogen, antioxidant and potential cancer chemoprevention agent. The presence of two hydroxyl groups on its chemical structure, with orientation analogous to estradiol, is responsible of both, its antioxidant capacity and its estrogenic activity. However, several studies show that the interaction of polyphenols with food and plasma proteins reduces their antioxidant efficacy.
   We studied the interaction of coumestrol with bovine serum albumin protein (BSA) by fluorescence spectroscopy and circular dichroism techniques, and the effect of this interaction on its antioxidant activity as a hydroxyl radical scavenger. In addition, coumestrol antioxidant capacity profile using different assays (DPPH, ORAC-FL and ORAC-EPR) was studied. To explain its reactivity we used several methodologies, including DFT calculations, to define its antioxidant mechanism.
   Coumestrol antioxidant activity unveiled interesting antioxidant properties. BSA interaction with coumestrol reduces significantly photolytic degradation in several media thus preserving its antioxidant properties. Results suggest no significant changes in BSA structure and activity when interacting with coumestrol. Furthermore, this interaction is stronger than for other phytoestrogens such as daidzein and genistein.
   Considering our promising results, we reported for the first time the fabrication and characterization of coumestrol-loaded albumin nanoparticles. The resulting spherical and homogeneous nanoparticles showed a diameter close to 96 nm. The coumestrol incorporation efficiency in BSA NPs was 22.4%, which is equivalent to 3 molecules of coumestrol for every 10 molecules of BSA.

AB The present work reports the development, optimization and characterization of novel lipid based nano-formulations viz., Liquid crystalline nanoparticles (LCNP), solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) and liposomes loaded with Tacrolimus (Tac) for topical delivery. Different nanoformulations were developed after screening lipids and suitable surfactants depending upon emulsification ability. The various nanoformulations were then optimized (to achieve higher entrapment efficacy, lower particle size, PDI and zeta potential), characterized and loaded into gel. The gels loaded with nanoformulations were also characterized depending upon rheology and viscosity. The gels were analyzed for in vitro drug release, HaCaT cell lines studies and skin permeation studies. The in vivo efficacy studies were carried out using mouse tail model and skin irritation studies using Draize patch test and measurement of TEWL. The developed nanoformulations showed optimum particle size (< 200 nm), polydispersity index (PDI < 0.3), zeta potential (>= -10 mV) and higher entrapment efficiency (> 85%). The nanoformulations showed higher penetration of Tac into skin. Tac-LCNP, Tac-SLN, Tac-NLC and Tac-liposomes loaded gels showed 14, 11.5, 12.5 and 3.7 folds increment in dermal bioavailability respectively, in comparison to free Tac loaded gel and 2.5, 2 and similar to 2 folds augmentation in dermal bioavailability respectively as compared to Tacroz (TM) Forte. In case of Tac-liposomes, the dermal bioavailability was lower as compared with the marketed formulation, Tacroz (TM) Forte. Despite, the increased bioavailability into the skin, the developed nanoformulations showed no significant skin irritation. The above mentioned nanoformulations were able to achieve greater penetration of Tac into the skin as compared to marketed ointment of Tac, Tacroz (TM) Forte.

AB The partitioning of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) in emulsions is influenced by various factors, such as composition of the phases, emulsifier type and concentration, and temperature. Therefore, the chemical stability of the API can be influenced by its partitioning into the aqueous phase as degradation is typically facilitated in water. With increasing emulsifier concentration from 0.15% to 5.0%, more betamethasone dipropionate (BDP) was solubilized in polysorbate 80 micelles leading to a small, but increased fraction of BDP exposed to the aqueous phase along with preferential partitioning of BDP to the aqueous phase and thus increased degradation. Similarly, by enhancing solubility and partitioning to the aqueous phase, the addition of polyethylene glycol 400 also led to increased BDP degradation. Due to pH dependent degradation of BDP, increasing emulsifier concentrations resulted in a more pronounced degradation of BDP at pH 8, which is beyond the stability optimum, whereas at pH 5 the API was sufficiently stable and no differences in concentration were detected within 12 weeks even under accelerated conditions. No significant differences were seen with the varying emulsifier concentrations regarding ex vivo skin penetration.

AB Formation of amorphous solid dispersions is an effective way to enhance the bioavailability of drugs. One of the main disadvantages of such systems is their low storage stability. Estimation and prognosis of storage stability of the amorphous solid dispersions are possible through modeling of the kinetics of crystallization by the Arrhenius equation and the resulting parameters, i.e., activation energy and pre-exponential factor. These parameters can be determined using the non-isothermal kinetics methods based on both model-fitting and model-free approaches using the differential scanning calorimetry data. In the present work, the formation of amorphous solid dispersions of the phenacetin model drug with polyvinylpyrrolidone of different molecular masses (3500-1.3 x 10(6) g.mol(-1)) was studied in a wide range of heating and cooling rates. The kinetic parameters of the crystallization process of the active pharmaceutic ingredient in the solid dispersions with increased drug content were determined. The dependence of the kinetic parameters of phenacetin cold crystallization on the molecular weight of the polymer is non-linear. The approaches used in the present work can find applications for the estimation of kinetic stability of amorphous pharmaceutical systems prone to crystallization.

AB Curcumin is a natural active constituent of Curcuma longa from Zingiberaceae family that shows many different pharmacological effects such as anticancer, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial and antiviral effect. However, its bioavailability is profoundly limited by its poor water solubility. In this study antisolvent crystallization followed by freeze drying was used for the preparation of curcumin nanoparticles. The presence of different ratios of hydrophilic polymers (poloxamer 188 & soluplus) on physicochemical properties of curcumin nanoparticles was also investigated. In addition, the effect of high pressure homogenization (HPH) on solubility and dissolution properties of curcumin was investigated. All nanoparticle formulations were examined to determine their particle size distribution, saturation solubility, morphology (SEM), solid state (DSC, XRPD and FT-IR) and dissolution behavior. It was observed that curcumin crystallized in the presence of polymers exhibited better solubility and dissolution rate in comparison with original curcumin. The results showed that the concentration of the stabilizer and the method used to prepare nanoparticles can control the dissolution of curcumin. The crystallized nanoparticles showed polymorph 2 curcumin with lower crystallinity and higher dissolution rate. Curcumin nanoparticles containing 50% soluplus prepared via HPH method presented 16-fold higher solubility than its original form. In conclusion, samples crystalized and proceed with HPH technique showed smaller particle size, better re-dispersibility, higher solubility and dissolution rate in water compared with a sample prepared using a simple antisolvent crystallization process.

AB Copper sulfide nanoparticles (CuS NPs), emerging nanoplatforms with dual diagnostic and therapeutic applications, are being actively investigated in this era of "war on cancer" owing to their versatility and adaptability. This article discusses the pros and cons of using CuS NPs in diagnostics, therapeutics, and theranostics. The first section introduces CuS NPs and discusses the features that render them more advantageous than other established nanoplatforms in cancer management. Subsequent sections include specific in vitro and in vivo results of different studies showing the potential of CuS NPs as nanoplatforms. Methods used for visualization (photoacoustic imaging and magnetic resonance imaging) of CuS NPs and treatment (phototherapy and combinatorial therapy) have also been discussed. Furthermore, the challenges and opportunities associated with using CuS NPs have been elucidated. Further investigations on CuS NPs are required to translate it for clinical applications.

AB Bone tissue engineering is an emerging medical field that has been developed in recent years to address pathologies with limited ability of bones to regenerate. Here we report the fabrication and characterization of microbial transglutaminase crosslinked gelatin-based scaffolds designed for serving as both cell substrate and growth factor release system. In particular, morphological, biomechanical and biological features have been analyzed. The enzyme ratio applied during the fabrication of the scaffolds affects the swelling capacity and the mechanical properties of the final structure. The developed systems are not cytotoxic according to the biocompatibility tests. The biological performance of selected formulations was studied using L-929 fibroblasts, D1 MSC and MG63 osteoblasts. Moreover, scaffolds allowed efficient osteogenic differentiation and signaling of MSCs. MSC cultured on the scaffolds not only presented lower proliferative and stemness profile, but also increased expression of osteoblast-related genes (Col1a1, Runx2, Osx). Furthermore, the in vitro release kinetics of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and bone morphogenetic protein -2 (BMP-2) from the scaffolds were also investigated. The release of the growth factors produced from the scaffolds followed a first order kinetics. These results highlight that the scaffolds designed and developed in this work may be suitable candidates for bone tissue regeneration purposes.

AB Artesunate-heparin conjugate (ART-HEP) based nanocapsules as drug delivery vehicle was developed for intracellular release of ART in malaria therapy. Owing both hydrophobic and hydrophilic moieties, the conjugate was successfully self-assembled into artesunate-heparin nanocapsules (ART-HEP-NCPs) with lower critical micelle concentration (CMC) of about 20 mu g/mL. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that ART-HEP-NCPs has an average hydrodynamic diameter of 112.1 nm with a negatively charged surface (-11.2 mV) and typical micellar nanostructure, respectively. Interestingly, such modification achieved high drug loading efficiency (DLE) of ART (29.3 wt%), which is significantly higher than already reported conventional ART-loaded nanoparticles. The nanocapsules demonstrated lower in vitro ART release under neutral physiological environment (33.81%) but higher release rate was observed in simulated acidic microenvironment (92.74%) in 70 h test. This behavior of ART-HEP-NCPs will facilitate the intracellular release of ART under slightly acidic parasitic food vacuole for effective antimalarial effect. Storage stability and hemolytic studies exhibited that ART-HEP based nanocapsules were stable and safe for intravenous (i.v) injection. Notably, ART-HEP-NCPs has promising internalization into Plasmodium infected red blood cells (iRBCs) and also displayed in vitro inhibitory effect against P. falciparum 3D7 with half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 10.16 nM, which was slightly higher than free ART (IC50 6.27 nM). This expected slightly lower inhibitory effect of polymeric prodrug could be ascribed to the gradual release of ART from the polymer chain over time. More importantly, the in vivo pharmacokinetics study indicated that the nanoscale characteristic of nanocapsules substantially contributed to the extended circulation of ART in blood. In conclusion, such multifunctional ART-HEP-NCPs with higher ART loading and extended half-life could be a promising platform for targeted antimalarial drug delivery.

AB The management of pain and inflammation arising from wounds is essential in obtaining effective healing rates. The application of a wound dressing loaded with an anti-inflammatory drug would enable both issues to be ameliorated, and the aim of this work was to fabricate such a dressing by electrospinning. Fibers comprising ethyl cellulose (EC) and poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) loaded with naproxen (Nap) were developed to be used in the early stages of wound care. A family of PVP/EC/Nap systems was prepared by varying the PVP: EC ratio. In all cases, the products of electrospinning comprise non-woven mats of fibers which generally have smooth and cylindrical morphologies. The formulations exist as amorphous solid dispersions, and there appear to be intermolecular interactions between the three components. Adjusting the polymer ratios results in tunable drug release, and formulations have been produced which give zero-order drug release over 20 and 80 h. The fiber mats generated in this work thus have great potential to be used as dressings for the treatment of wound pain and inflammation.

AB The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a self-emulsifying delivery system (SEDDS) for oral rutin fatty ester administration and to improve its mucus permeating properties by the incorporation of the silicon polymer poly [dimethylsiloxane-co-(3-(2-(2-hydroxyethoxy)ethoxy)propyl]methylsiloxane] (PDMSHEPMS) in the formulation. In order to increase the lipophilicity of the flavonoid and to dissolve it in SEDDS, enzymatic acylation of rutin with lauric acid was catalyzed by lipase from Candida antarctica in acetone. Different formulations were evaluated regarding their emulsifying properties and ability to dissolve the rutin ester. Suitable SEDDS was chosen and characterized regarding droplet size, polydispersity index, and zeta potential. The rutin fatty ester was loaded into SEDDS to 7% (w/w). Different concentrations of PDMSHEPMS were incorporated in SEDDS for following mucus permeation studies. Formulation with 10% of PDMSHEPMS showed 1.9-fold increase in mucus permeation compared to the formulation without PDMSHEPMS. Furthermore, the formulation with 10% of PDMSHEPMS showed a significant increase in mucus permeation compared with rutin fatty ester without formulation. According to these results, SEDDS containing PDMSHEPMS might be a promising strategy to increase the oral bioavailability of rutin.

AB The drug nanocrystals (NCs) with unique physicochemical properties are now considered as a promising drug delivery system for poorly water-soluble drugs. So far > 20 formulations of NCs have been approved in the market. In this review, we summarized recent advances of NCs with emphasis on their therapeutic applications based on administration route and disease states. At the end, we present a brief description of the future perspectives of NCs and their potential role as a promising drug delivery system. As a strategy for solubilization and bioavailability enhancement, the NCs have gained significant success. Besides this, the function of NCs is still far from developed. The emerging NC-based drug delivery approach would widen the applications of NCs in drug delivery and bio-medical field. Their in vitro and in vivo fate is extremely unclear; and the development of hybrid NCs with environment-sensitive fluorophores may assist to extend the scope of bio-imaging and provide better insight to their intracellular uptake kinetics, in vitro and in vivo.

AB Rice starch is known to have an excellent film-forming behaviour in the packaging industry but inadequate attention was given to this biopolymer to be developed into thin films for drug delivery. Accordingly, rice starch thin films containing a model drug, paracetamol and plasticisers (glycerol or sorbitol) were developed using film casting technique. This study focuses on investigating the impact of plasticiser and drug loading on drug release pattern of rice starch films which has not been explored to date. The obtained rice films were characterised for their physicochemical properties including swelling and dissolution study. The highest drug dissolution rate was achieved in the rice films with a low drug loading due to drug amorphicity in nature. When drug loading increases, the swelling behaviour of rice films plays a dominant role in releasing drug in the crystalline form. The role of plasticiser was indicated by the plasticiser-starch interaction where a strong interaction allows drug solubilisation more readily in the dissolution medium. It is envisaged that rice films could be tailored to achieve desired drug release pattern with different plasticiser.

AB Acceptability of medicines is critical for effective pharmacotherapy. The aim of this study was to investigate the oral sensory properties of tablet coatings to determine how mouthfeel can improve acceptability. A randomised double-blind study was performed in 84 adult volunteers (51% >= 55 years). Each participant received 4 placebo tablets (3 coated and 1 uncoated) to evaluate (i) ease of swallowing and (ii) palatability. Visual analogue scales (VAS) were used to capture sensory parameters. Acceptability was assessed using the following parameters: ease of swallowing; amount of water taken with the tablet; rank order of preference; roughness; adhesiveness and slipperiness. Ease of swallowing was determined to be the most sensitive measure of acceptance. The best coating was the one that was reported to be the most slippery and smooth.
   The presence of a coating improved ease of swallowing, mouthfeel and overall palatability. This study demonstrates that slippery coatings improve acceptability of tablets. The study also demonstrates the value of VAS to measure the sensory attributes of coated tablets.

AB Purpose: To develop a three-dimensional visualization method for evaluating the distribution of pulmonary drug delivery systems and compare four tissue-clearing techniques (Clear(T2), CUBIC, ScaleS, and SeeDB2) using intrapulmonary liposomes as drug carriers.
   Methods: Rhodamine B-labeled liposomes were administered intrapulmonarily to mice using a MicroSprayer, and then fluorescent-labeled tomato lectin was administered intravenously to visualize the general lung structure. Tissue-clearing treatment of the mouse lungs was performed using the standard protocols of the Clear(T2), CUBIC, ScaleS, and SeeDB2 techniques. Lung clearing was clarified using laser-scanning confocal microscopy, and three-dimensional images were reconstructed.
   Results: Fluorescent-labeled tomato lectin was preserved using Clear(T2) and SeeDB2 but not using CUBIC and ScaleS. In addition, the liposomes were stable in Clear(T2) reagent, but they were mostly degraded in other reagents by surface-active agents. Clear(T2) treatment enabled the three-dimensional visualization of intrapulmonary rhodamine B-labeled liposomes at the alveolar scale.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that the Clear(T2) tissue-clearing technique was appropriate for the three-dimensional visualization of intrapulmonary liposomes at the alveolar scale. This study provides important information for selecting and optimizing suitable optical tissue-clearing techniques in lungs for evaluating the distribution of pulmonary drug delivery systems.

AB The present study evaluates the effect of L-leucine concentration and operating parameters of a laboratory spray dryer on characteristics of trehalose dry powders, with the goal of optimizing production of these powders for inhaled drug delivery. Trehalose/L-leucine mixtures were spray dried from aqueous solution using a laboratory spray dryer. A factorial design of experiment (DoE) was undertaken and process parameters adjusted were: inlet temperature, gas flow rate, feed solution flow rate (pump setting), aspiration setting and L-leucine concentration. Resulting powders were characterised in terms of particle size, yield, residual moisture content, and glass transition temperature. Particle size was mainly influenced by gas flow rate, whereas product yield and residual moisture content were found to be primarily affected by inlet temperature and spray solution feed rate respectively. Interactions between a number of different process parameters were elucidated, as were relationships between different responses. The leucine mass ratio influenced the physical stability of powders against environmental humidity, and a high leucine concentration (30% w/w) protected amorphous trehalose from moisture induced crystallization. High weight ratio of leucine in the formulation, however, negatively impacted the aerosol performance. Thus, in terms of L-leucine inclusion in a formulation designed for pulmonary delivery, a balance needs to be found between physical stability and deposition characteristics.

AB Eudragit (R) E PO (EPO) is a terpolymer based on N, N-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate with methylmethacrylate and butylmethacrylate, produced by Evonik Industries AG as a pharmaceutical excipient. In this work, EPO was chemically modified through reaction with acryloyl chloride. The successful modification of EPO was confirmed by FTIR, NMR-spectroscopy, elemental and thermal analysis. The degree of acrylation was determined by permanganatometric titration. The slug mucosal irritation test was used to demonstrate non-irritant nature of EPO and its acrylated derivatives (AEPO). The mucoadhesive properties of EPO and AEPO were evaluated using freshly excised sheep nasal mucosa and it was demonstrated that acrylated polymers facilitated greater retention of sodium fluorescein on mucosal surfaces compared to solution mixture of this dye solution with EPO as well as free dye.

AB The progress of short interfering RNA (siRNA) technologies has unlocked the development of novel alternatives for the treatment of a myriad of diseases, including viral infections, autoimmune disorders, or cancer. Nevertheless, the clinical use of these therapies faces significant challenges, mainly overcoming the charged and large nature of these molecules to effectively enter the cell. In this work, we developed a cationic polymer nanoparticle system that is able to load siRNA due to electrostatic interactions. The pH-responsiveness and membrane-disrupting ability of these carriers make them suitable intracellular delivery vehicles. In the work presented herein we synthesized, characterized, and evaluated the properties of nanoparticles based on 2-diethylaminoethyl methacrylate and tertbutyl methacrylate copolymers. A disulfide crosslinker was incorporated in the nanogels to enable the degradation of the nanoparticles in reductive environments, showing no significant changes on their physicochemical properties. The capability of the developed nanogels to be internalized, deliver siRNA, and induce gene knockdown were demonstrated using a human epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line. Overall, these findings suggest that this platform exhibits desirable characteristics as a potential siRNA-delivery platform.

AB Due to their ultrafine network structures, electrospun nanofibres have been potentially used for wound application. In order to develop a desired wound dressing material, shellac (SHL) was blended with polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP). Monolaurin (ML), which is a natural antimicrobial lipid, was incorporated into the SHL-PVP blended fibres to prevent delayed wound healing resulting from microbial infection. A full factorial design with three replicated centre points was employed in order to determine the main and interaction effects of various factors including SHL ratio in SHL-PVP blended solution, ML content and applied voltage on the multiple responses such as morphology, surface wettability, absorbency and mechanical properties. According to the results, an increase in the PVP content could lead to a significant increase in tensile strength and elongation. In addition, the presence of PVP contributed to an improvement in the drug loading capacity and dissolution rate. The fabricated fibres loaded with ML exhibited an excellent activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans, and also provided an enhanced ability in the cell adhesion. Therefore, SHL-PVP blended fibres loaded with ML might be effectively used for application in wound healing.

AB Spray drying is one of the widely used manufacturing processes in pharmaceutical industry. While there are voluminous experimental studies pertaining to the impact of various process-formulation parameters on the quality attributes of spray dried powders such as particle size, morphology, density, and crystallinity, there is scant information available in the literature regarding process scale-up. Here, we first analyze salient features of scale-up attempts in literature. Then, spray drying process is analyzed considering the fundamental physical transformations involved, i.e., atomization, drying, and gas-solid separation. Each transformation is scrutinized from a scale-up perspective with non-dimensional parameters & multi-scale analysis, and comprehensively discussed in engineering context. Successful scale-up entails similar key response variables from each transformation across various scales. These variables are identified as droplet size distribution, outlet temperature, relative humidity, separator pressure loss coefficient, and collection efficiency. Instead of trial-and-error-based approaches, this review paper advocates the use of mechanistic models and scale-up rules for establishing design spaces for the process variables involved in each transformation of spray drying. While presenting a roadmap for process development and scale-up, the paper demonstrates how to bridge the current gap in spray drying scaleup via a rational understanding of the fundamental transformations.

TI smartPearls (R) for dermal bioavailability enhancement - Long-term

ID MESOPOROUS SILICA; SOLUBILITY; DELIVERY; FORMULATIONS
AB smartPearls (R) are a novel dermal delivery system based on mesoporous (pores 2-50 nm) particles, developed in 2014. Their pores can be loaded with active which is long-term stabilized in its amorphous state. The increased saturation solubility by the amorphous state leads to an increased dermal bioavailability of poorly soluble actives. To avoid sedimentation of the porous particles (3-50 mu m) in dermal formulations, viscoelastic gels were developed using iota-carrageenan, polyacrylate and the viscoelastic Kuhne salad dressing as a reference from food industry. Silica particles (company Grace/US, 50 and 150 mu m) were loaded into the gels and long-term stability was assessed by a VIS sedimentation test. Furthermore, the gels were characterized by analytical centrifugation (LUMiSizer (R)) to assess the critical rpm/g values, allowing to order them after their absolute viscoelastic stabilizing ability. Characterization was complemented by rotation rheology, amplitude sweep and a frequency sweep analysis for the determination of elastic and viscous moduli G' and G '' at varying conditions. Based on the throughout characterization, polymers can be selected to sufficiently stabilize dermal formulations even with large sized smartPearls (R) - the prerequisite for using this delivery system in dermal products.

AB Antigen specific immunotherapy aims to tolerise patients to specific autoantigens that are responsible for the pathology of an autoimmune disease. Immune tolerance is generated in conditions where the immune response is suppressed and thus gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are an attractive drug delivery platform due to their anti-inflammatory effects and their potential to facilitate temporal and spatial delivery of a peptide autoantigen in conjunction with pro-tolerogenic elements. In this study we have covalently attached an autoantigen, currently under clinical evaluation for the treatment of type 1 diabetes (PIC19-A3 peptide), to AuNPs to create nanoscale (< 5 nm), negatively charged (-40 to -60 mV) AuNP-peptide complexes for immunotherapy. We also employ a clinically approved microneedle delivery system, MicronJet600, to facilitate minimally-invasive intradermal delivery of the nanoparticle constructs to target skin-resident antigen presenting cells, which are known to be apposite target cells for immunotherapy. The AuNP-peptide complexes remain physically stable upon extrusion through microneedles and when delivered into ex vivo human skin they are able to diffuse rapidly and widely throughout the dermis (their site of deposition) and, perhaps more surprisingly, the overlying epidermal layer. Intracellular uptake was extensive, with Langerhans cells proving to be the most efficient cells at internalising the AuNP-peptide complex (94% of the local population within the treated region of skin). In vitro studies showed that uptake of the AuNP-peptide complexes by dendritic cells reduced the capacity of these cells to activate naive T cells. This indicator of biological functionality encourages further development of the AuNP-peptide formulation, which is now being evaluated in clinical trials.

AB Photosensitizer-based photodynamic therapy (PDT) has attracted great attention in cancer treatment. However, achieving efficient delivery of photosensitizers is still a great challenge for their clinical applications. The photosensitizer-encapsulating delivery nanosystem usually suffers from poor stability, complex preparation process and low drug loading. Herein, we utilize a surfactant-like chemotherapeutic agent, mitoxantrone (MTX), as a nanocarrier to deliver a photosensitizer pyropheophorbide a (PPa) for antitumor therapy. MTX consists of aromatic rings (hydrophobic part) and two amino-groups and two hydroxyl-groups (hydrophilic part) with planar structure, which could interact with PPa via pi-pi stacking, hydrophobic interactions, intermolecular hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions. This system (PPa@MTX) spontaneously forms near-spherical nanostructures (similar to 150 nm), has a high loading capacity for PPa (56.5%) and exhibits a pH-responsive drug release manner in vitro. In vivo antitumor efficacy evaluations show that the pegylated PPa@MTX nanosystem has increased accumulation in tumor tissues and enhanced antitumor efficacy in female BALB/c mice bearing murine mammary carcinoma (4T1) tumor cells, compared to free PPa. Employing the surfactant-like drug as nanocarriers, our results show that the "drug-delivering-drug" strategy is a good foundation for the development of novel PDT-based drug delivery system against cancer.

AB The control of the glycemic level among diabetes/T2 patients is very important for their long term survival and avoiding further complexities including micro/macrovascular diseases as well as diabetic neuropathy. Vildagliptin (VD) is a drug that has addressed these issues successfully with the desired safety portfolio. We used DNA-nanocubes for initial nano-encapsulation of VD followed by HPMC/EC coating. The results revealed the stable, smooth, spherical and nano-sized nanoparticles with improved size uniformity (from 100 to 400 nm in diameter) and encapsulation-efficiency (E.E.%) than previously reported (500-2000 nm) with the chemical compatibility evident in ATR/FTIR and DSC results. Animal experiments results revealed the improvement of incretin level in the serums due to potent DPP-4 inhibition compared to the free-VD/solution with better maintenance of glycemic levels after feeding. The safety of these HPMC/EC-DNA-VD nanoparticles was assessed through the histological-examination after completion of the treatment turn. The solvent evaporation technique provided the better coating of HPMC around DNA-core with gastro-resistant and effervescent property due to presence of NaHCO3 (0.01%) in the formulations that caused delayed delivery of VD as well as nanoparticles to the intestine, increasing the availability time of the drug and nanospheres at the target sites (intestine and blood) where DPP-4 enzyme is most abundant (to degrade the GLP-1 and GIP causing loss of control of the postprandial glycemic levels. So the availability of sustained release nanospheres near the target sites and prolonged DPP-4 inhibition improved the outcomes of the therapy.

AB Vinyl alcohol (VA) copolymers having fine tunable polarities are emerging materials in drug delivery applications. VA copolymers rendering well-defined molecular architecture (C/OH ratio = 2, 4, 5 and 8) were used as carriers for model drug compound, fluorescein, which exhibited significantly different release characteristics depending on the polarity of the polymers. Based on the preliminary drug release tests the well-defined VA copolymer having C/OH = 5 ratio, poly(vinyl alcohol alt-propenylene) copolymer (PVA-5) was selected for nanocomposite synthesis. Sorafenib anticancer drug was embedded into PVA-5 (C/OH = 5 ratio) nanoparticles by nanoprecipitation resulting in nanoparticles exhibiting unusual cubic shape. The sorafenib-loaded nanocomposites showed continuous release during a day and concentration-dependant cytotoxicity on HT-29 cancer cells. This might be interpreted by the sustained release of the drug.

AB Therapeutic cancer vaccines need thoughtful design to efficiently deliver appropriate antigens and adjuvants to the immune system. In the current study, we took advantage of the versatility of a liposomal platform to conceive and customize vaccines containing three elements needed for the induction of efficient antitumor immunity: i) a CD4 epitope peptide able to activate CD4(+) T helper cells, ii) a CD8 tumor-specific epitope peptide recognized by CD8(+) T cytotoxic cells and iii) Pattern Recognition Receptor (PRR) agonists which stand as adjuvants. Each type of component, conjugated to liposomes, was evaluated individually by comparing their vaccine efficacy after immunization of naive mice. These screening steps resulted in the optimization of three liposomal constructs bearing a peptide from HA influenza virus protein as CD4 epitope, a peptide from HPV16 E7 oncoprotein as CD8 epitope and TLR4, TLR2/6 or NOD1 agonists as adjuvant, which displayed antitumor efficiency against a mouse model of disseminated tumors transformed by HPV16. Our results validated the interest of our customizable liposomal platform as delivery system for cancer vaccination. We also demonstrated its interest as tool for vaccine design allowing the strategical selection of components, and the evaluation of epitope-adjuvant association.

   RELEASE
AB Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the main health problems worldwide. It is characterised by chronic inflammation in the lungs that leads to progressive, chronic, largely irreversible airflow obstruction. The use of long-acting beta agonists remain today the frontline treatment for COPD with the aim of minimizing side effects and enhancing therapeutic usefulness. To this purpose, in this paper, mucoadhesive solid lipid microparticles (SLMs) containing a long-acting beta-2 agonist, Salmeterol Xinafoate (SX) were prepared, characterised (size, z-potential, aerodynamic diameter, turbidimetric evaluations, drug loading and entrapping efficiency) and tested in a model of bronchial epithelial cells. It was demonstrated that the incorporation of SX into SLMs led to the production of particles suitable for inhalation and more efficient than the free molecule at increasing the cAMP expression in bronchial epithelial cells.
   In conclusion, the prepared systems, due to their aerodynamic behaviour and mucoadhesive properties, could improve the retention time of SX in the lung epithelium and its therapeutic effect, thus representing a good strategy for the treatment of COPD patients.

AB A joint investigation of n-undecane (n-UND) in the bulk and confined states in irregular silica gel (SG) matrices differing in their surface composition via two extrinsic probes using positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS) and electron spin resonance (ESR) as well as DSC technique is presented. Ortho-positronium (o-Ps) exhibits a pronounced change in the annihilation behavior as detected by the o-Ps lifetime,tau(3), as a function of temperature due to the enhanced amorphization of the n-UND after confinement with respect to the bulk solid n-UND. In addition, with an exception of the low-T region it exhibits rather small alterations in the confined state in the unmodified (virgin) SG100 angstrom-SIL compared to modified (silanized) SG100 angstrom-C4. On the other side, the stable free radical of nitroxide type 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinyl-1-oxy(TEMPO) shows the essential differences in the spectral properties with temperature not only in the confined n-UND with respect to the bulk sample, but especially in the confined state in the modified SG-C4 matrix compared to the unmodified SG100 angstrom-SIL one. These differences are attributed to the presence and absence of the preferential interaction of the polar spin probe TEMPO with the polar surface of the virgin SG matrix or the apolar surface of the silanized SG100 angstrom-C4 one, respectively. The coinciding relationships between the characteristic PALS and ESR temperatures reflecting the changes in annihilation and rotation dynamics of the respective extrinsic probes are related to the dynamic and phase transitions as found by wide-T DSC.

AB Quaternary Gd2O3 NPs doped zinc borotellurite (TeO2-B2O3-ZnO-Gd2O3 NPs) glass system were fabricated using conventional melt-quenching method with composition {[(TeO2)(70)(B2O3)(30)](70)(ZnO)(30)}(1-x)(Gd2O3 NPs)(x) (x = 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 and 5.0 mol%). The physical, structural and elastic properties of the glass samples were investigated. X-ray diffraction (XRD) were used to confirm the amorphousity of the samples. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy indicated the presence of TeO3, TeO4, BO3 and BO4 structural units within the glass matrix. The presence of Gd2O3 NPs was proven from Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). The density and molar volume showed anomalous behavior. The elastic properties of the glass system were characterized by using pulse-echo technique. The longitudinal and shear ultrasonic velocities vary from 3883 to 4042 m/s and 2265 to 2282 m/s, respectively. The observed change in the ultrasonic velocities imply that there are substantial change in the structure of the vitreous network. The experimental elastic moduli (longitudinal modulus (L), shear modulus (G), bulk modulus (K) and Young's modulus (E)) increases from 68.77 to 79.45 GPa, 23.40 to 26.68 GPa, 37.56 to 48.25 GPa and 58.13 to 66.55 GPa, respectively. The increase in elastic moduli of the glass system indicates that the strength and rigidity of the glass increase. The experimental elastic moduli were correlated and compared with the theoretically calculated elastic moduli using Makishima-Mackenzie and Bond Compression model.

AB Water plays a crucial role in the entire process of geopolymer synthesis. To clarify the effects of water on the geopolymerization process and microstructures of fly ash (FA) based geopolymers, the differences induced by varying n(H2O: Na2Oeq) ratio from 13-17 were investigated by ICC testing, XRD, FTIR, MIP, SEM and TGA-DSC analysis. A higher n(H2O: Na2Oeq) ratio contributes to the dissolution of the active component of fly ash, but hinders the polymerization reaction of monomeric and oligomeric gels. According to the total heat release and the standard enthalpies of formation of the reactants, the degree of reaction for the FA-based geopolymers from 0 to 12 h at 60 degrees C rose from 4.9% to 5.6% with an increase of the n(H2O: Na2Oeq) ratio. More water could increase both porosity and pore size of geopolymers from 32.3% to 45.6% and from 7.1 nm to 18.1 nm, respectively. All samples had a weight loss of similar to 12% associated with the evaporation of water after they are heated to 275 degrees C corresponded to similar to 75% of the total weight loss. Nearly all of the water was lost by similar to 700 degrees C as confirmed by TGA. The compressive strength of the geopolymers at all ages declined by 62% with an increase in the n(H2O: Na2Oeq) ratio from 13 to 17.

AB xZnO-30B(2)O(3)-(65-x)Bi2O3-BaO (x = 40-60 mol%) glasses were prepared by the melt quenching method. The microstructure, crystallization behavior, and thermal properties of the glasses were investigated. The results show that the samples with 40-55 mol% ZnO possess an amorphous structure after melting at 950 degrees C. When the ZnO content increases to 60 mol%, the sample possesses strip-shaped Zn3B2O6 crystals after melting at 950 degrees C, and becomes homogenous glass at 1050 degrees C. The thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) decreases from 10.294 to 7.43 x 10(-6)/degrees C when the ZnO content increases from 40 to 60 mol%. Both the glass transition temperature and glass softening temperature increase with increasing ZnO content. In addition, needle-shaped Bi2ZnB2O7 crystals are observed on the glass surface after annealing at crystallization temperatures for 1 h, and the amount of crystals decreases with increasing ZnO content. Furthermore, the weight loss ratio of the glasses increases gradually as the content of ZnO increases. After 48 h, the magnitude of weight loss value in 6 wt% of HNO3 or NaOH solution at 90 degrees C is 10(-3) g/cm(3).min while it is 10(-7) g/cm(3).min in deionized water.

AB Thermal conductivities of alkali-silicate (R2O-SiO2 (R = Li, Na, K)) and calcium-alkali-silicate (CaO-R2O-SiO2 (R = Li, Na, K)) melts were evaluated by combining their thermal effusivities measured using the front-heating front-detection laser flash method with their density and specific heat capacity. Results of the evaluation revealed that the temperature-dependences of the thermal conductivities of the R2O-SiO2 and CaO-R2O-SiO2 (R = Li, Na, K) melts are small over the temperature range investigated. Moreover, the thermal conductivities of the CaO-R2O-SiO2 melts are almost equal to those of the R2O-SiO2 melts. Therefore, the network frame of the CaO-R2O-SiO2 melts can presumably become dense owing to the ion bonding between Ca2+ and the non-bridging oxygen.

AB An investigation had been conducted to study the effect of CaO/SiO2 mass ratio and B2O3 on the crystallization behavior and the melt structure of fluorine-free mold fluxes. The results showed that the increase of CaO/SiO2 ratio tends to promote the crystallization behavior of the fluorine-free mold flux system, due to the depolymerization of the original complex borosilicate structure by the released free oxygen (O2-) ions with the added CaO. Small amount of B2O3 would initially inhibit the mold flux crystallization, then the further addition would promote crystallization. The melt structure analysis results suggested that with the addition of B2O3 content, the existing silicate structure would connect with each other and also link with the dissociative [BO3]-trihedral units to form borosilicate chain. Simultaneously, O-2(-) could destroy the original diborate structure and form two simple borate structures. Subsequently, the simple borate structure would connect with the dissociative [BO3]-trihedral and the formed borosilicate chain to form a more complex borosilicate structure. Thus, the degree of polymerization of whole molten slag was getting improved, but the overall effect on the mold flux crystallization was depended on the balance between the molten slag structure and viscosity, in which 6 mass% was the critical point in the current mold flux system.

AB Bulk methods and B-11 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance were used to propose a calibration curve to determine the total B2O3 and the boron speciation using the non-destructive and the non-quantitative nature of Raman spectroscopy. The calibration was established from the analyses of 21 aluminoborosilicate glasses synthesised at 1 atm. and 1150 degrees C and an additional standard aluminoborosilicate glass. The studied glasses have composition in the Na2O-CaO-Al2O3-SiO2-B2O3 system with total B2O3 from 4.7 to 46.6 mol%.
   Raman spectra exhibit signatures in the 800-1200 and 1200-1600 cm(-1) region corresponding to the symmetric stretches of silicate (HF) and borate networks (B-O-), respectively. The integrated area ratio (AB-O-/AHF) is correlated to the total mol.% B2O3. The mol.% B2O3 data are reproduced within 15% from the Raman spectra.
   Boron speciation from B-11 NMR is correlated to the AB-O-/AHF determined by Raman; however, the mol.% BO4 appears also dependent on the Al2O3 content. We derived a multiple linear regression estimating the mol.% BO4 as a function of AB-O-/AHF and mol.% Al2O3. Results are valid for the investigated glasses and additional work is needed to better constrain the speciation model.

TI Effect of curing temperature on the synthesis, structure and mechanical

SO JOURNAL OF NON-CRYSTALLINE SOLIDS
LA English
DT Article
ID ACID; SILICA; NMR
AB The purpose of this work was to study the effect of curing temperature on the synthesis, structure and mechanical properties of Phosphate-based geopolymers, using two curing temperatures for geopolymers preparation: room temperature and slightly elevated one (60 degrees C). The main techniques used to achieve this purpose are quasi-isothermal Differential Scanning Calorimetry measurements (DSC), atomic absorption measurements, compressive strength measurements, Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray powder Diffraction (XRD) and Si-29, Al-27 and P-31 magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS-NMR). Experimental results showed that the increase of curing temperature activates the dealumination of metakaolin and accelerates the different geopolymeric steps. Moreover, for both considered curing temperatures, the obtained geopolymer presents an amorphous composite material composed of two geopolymeric networks: a first geopolymeric network based on Al-O-P units and another one based on Si-O-T units (with T = Si, Al and P). The only structural difference generated by the variation of curing temperature is in the quantity of the formed phases. In fact, the temperature elevation yields to a geopolymer structure richer in aluminum phosphate phases which enhances the material compressive strength (29.9 MPa).

AB Fundamental issues of U-based binary metallic glasses (MGs) have been scarcely studied due to their low thermostability and glass forming ability (GFA). In this work, the glass formation in U-Ni system was reexamined. It is found that currently designed U-Ni glassy alloys in the range of 54-75% U show a pronounced thermal glass transition feature for the first time among binary U-based systems, and also have the glass transition temperature (T-g) above 600 K and much stronger thermostability than other similar U-based glasses. The T-g presence contributes to the evaluation of their glass transition activation energy, liquid fragility, viscosity as well as the Kauzmann temperature. Moreover, the fragility value of the typical alloy U69.2Ni30.8 is about 20, almost the same as those of the oxide glass formers SiO2 and GeO2, illustrating that U-Ni is a binary strong glass forming system. The reasons for the remarkable T-g presence and low fragility together with the GFA level of U-based MGs are discussed.

AB The present study investigates the efficiency of alkaline fusion method to enhance the geopolymeric reactivity of phosphate mine tailings. The effect of sodium hydroxide content and fusion temperature on the mineralogical composition of the fused phosphate sludge was assessed by XRD measurement. The microstructure as well as the mechanical behavior of the prepared geopolymer mortars were investigated using compressive strength test and EDS/SEM analysis. Furthermore, the thermal stability of samples was studied by measuring the mechanical properties after exposure to several cycles of heat treatment at different elevated temperatures (350, 500, 650 and 800 degrees C). The obtained results showed that the structure of phosphate sludge underwent a significant variation after fusion. Alkali thermal treatment led mainly to the decomposition of illite, palygorskite and dolomite, and the formation of Na-rich crystalline phases. NaOH content as well as temperature of fusion has been proved to be essential factors controlling the transformations of the material structure and hence the development of the geopolymer strength. The optimum conditions of fusion were set at 10 wt% of NaOH and a temperature of 550 degrees C, providing geopolymer mortars with high compressive strength (40 MPa).

AB Several different compositions of zinc-containing glasses in the CaO-SiO2 system were obtained by both traditional melting technique and the sol-gel method. The influence of zinc ions addition in the glass composition was evaluated using different spectroscopic methods (FTIR and Si-29 MAS-NMR). It was demonstrated that ZnO has a significant effect on glass structure and, as a consequence, on thermal properties, texture and bioactivity. EDX and ICP data showed that zinc ions reduce glass bioactivity and incorporate in the newly forming HCA layer. Evaluation of the in vitro biocompatibility of the obtained materials was performed by indirect tests using MG-63 osteoblast-like cells. All samples were found to be biocompatible and zinc ions enhanced the cell viability. Antibacterial tests against gram-negative (E. coli) and gram-positive bacteria (S. aureus) were carried out to evaluate the antibacterial potential of the zinc-doped glasses.

AB The pressure-assisted melt filling technique (PAMFT) is promising approach for integrating new materials such as glasses or semiconductor into fiber, while only a small amount of starting material (< 0.1 mg) is actually required for the implementation of such hybrid optical fibers of length of several centimeters. PAMFT has also the capability to provide viscosity data of glass-forming melts determined during the filling process. The main advantage of this technique - the demand of only small amounts of material (< 0.1 mg) is accompanied by the fact that the molten material is encapsulated inside a silica capillary under high pressure. Therefore, PAMFT represents a promising method for measuring highly volatile and corrosive materials, such as chalcogenides. Here we present a detailed analysis on applying PAMFT for viscosity measurement of chosen chalcogenide systems with respect to experimental conditions (applied pressure and capillary diameter) and physical materials properties (surface tension and contact angle towards silica glass). For our study, we chose two well-known chalcogenide materials (Se and As2Se3) as representatives of non-wetting and wetting liquids towards silica glass. The melt viscosities were measured in the range of 0.01-25 Pa.s showing that PAMFT is a suitable method for the determination of viscosity of chalcogenide melts providing reliable data even if in the situation the influence of surface tension and contact angle is neglected. We also present new viscosity data on Se95Te5 chalcogenide melt obtained using PAMFT.

AB The dielectric behavior of five aromatic thermoplastic polyimides with a sequentially changing chemical structure of the diamine and dianhydride parts of the macromolecule is studied. The dielectric spectra have shown three ranges of dipole polarization relaxation: gamma, beta (in the glassy state) and alpha (in the highly elastic state). The gamma process takes place due to local mobility of phenylene rings in the diamine moiety of the macromolecule. The beta process is related with local mobility of phenylene rings in the diamine and dianhydride parts of the macromolecule with adjacent polar groups. For gamma and beta processes, the chemical structure of polyimides has virtually no effect on molecular mobility. The source of the alpha process is large-scale segmental mobility. Its molecular mobility is more caused by the structure of the dianhydride part rather than that of the diamine one. It is shown that there is a linear correlation between free volume and glass transition temperature, which is determined by the dielectric method.

AB This study systematically analyzed the correlation between topological structure and chemical ordering on the optical and thermal properties of synthesized material in the glass forming region of the GexGaySe1-x-y ternary. A series of ten compositions from 5 to 30 mol% Ge and 5 to 15 mol% Ga were examined within the ternary, showing broadband infrared properties with transmission from 1 to 25 mu m. Topological constraint theory applied to compositions examined exhibited sharp inflection at the average coordination number of < r > = 2.67 defined as the chemical threshold where the glass network consists of tetrahedral Ge(Ga)Se-2 units. These observations indicate that thermal and optical properties in these chalcogenide glasses are highly sensitive to the chemical ratio of homopolar versus heteropolar bonds, Ge to Ga ratio, as well as the dimensionality of the topological structure. Glass transition and crystallization temperature values compare well with previous literature on similar Ge-X-Se systems. This is a comprehensive study that systematically examined thermal conductivity, heat capacity, absorption coefficient, and refractive index within the GexGaySe1-x-y system, correlating these properties with structural network calculations. The presented methodology and findings will enable the compositional design of materials for infrared systems using GexGaySe1-x-y glasses with broadband transmission.

AB Fused silica samples were subjected to laser induced shock loading. Laser flux was varied in order to obtain different amounts and characteristics of damage in the samples. Three dimensional damage and fracture maps of two identical samples impacted by high and low laser flux values were obtained using both optical microscopy and X-ray computed micro-tomography. Three prevalent fracture and damage patterns were identified. Peridynamic approach was used to simulate the laser impact conditions on the samples in order to explain the causes of the observed fracture and damage morphologies. A proprietary shock physics code, ESTHER, was used to calculate the transient kinetic energy imparted to the samples based on the experimental laser flux values. The kinetic energy values were then integrated over time and provided target values to match for the peridynamic impact conditions. The main fracture patterns were captured by peridynamic simulations with reasonable quantitative accuracy. Explanations for initiation and propagation of each of the fracture patterns were presented based on the peridynamic dynamic fracture simulations. Limitations of the computational approach and recommendations for future work is provided.

AB The silica aerogel was synthesized by simple and cost-effective sol-gel process under ambient pressure drying. The wet gel was modified by using trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) as silylating agent. The prepared aerogel was characterized by X-ray diffractometer (XRD), thermogravimetric and differential thermal analyzer (TG-DTA), Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FT-IR), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analyzer, field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) and Ultraviolet-Visible (UV-Vis) spectrophotometer for structural, thermal, functional, surface, morphological and optical properties. The presence of hump in X-ray diffraction pattern revealed the amorphous nature of prepared silica aerogel. Thermal stability of silica aerogel investigated by TG-DTA show a hydrophobic nature up to 478 degrees C. FE-SEM images confirmed the porous nature of silica aerogel. The surface area and pore radius measured by BET analyzer disclosed as 792.308 m(2)/g and 5.779 nm respectively while the total pore volume is 2.289 cc/g. Superhydrophobic nature of silica aerogel sample was affirmed by contact angle measurements. The energy band gap calculated from UV-Vis spectra was found to be 4.25 eV confirming the insulating nature of prepared silica aerogel. The resulting silica aerogel possesses high thermal stability, Superhydrophobicity and large specific surface area which can be useful in various applications such as catalysis, coating materials, oil spill cleanup processes and insulating materials.

AB Silica based optical waveguides are restricted by the silica material parameters such as low nonlinear refractive index and transparency below 3.0 mu m. These limitations have led to investigation of new materials with high nonlinear refractive index and transparency in the mid-infrared (IR) region such as tellurite glasses, possessing considerable interest for a broad range of applications in the domain of optical telecommunication and sensing due to their wealth of excellent optical characteristics. We aim to explore the fundamental propagation properties of tellurite glasses based high-index core microstructured optical fibers (MOFs) by using the field model to judge the feasibility of using nonsilica glasses as the background material. Comparison with available numerical simulation results also has been included.

SO JOURNAL OF NON-CRYSTALLINE SOLIDS
LA English
DT Article
DE Silica; Localized states; Photoconductivity; Dember effect; Space charge
   limited current
AB The photoelectric response of pure silica glasses excited by excimer lasers has been studied. The samples were made under various conditions. Photoelectric polarization of samples due to the Dember effect has been registered. The signal was recorded under the conditions of a space charge limited current. The space charge resulting from the capture of electrons and holes creates a static electric field that prevents diffusion of released charge carriers. The current registration in the external circuit stops, despite the continuation of photoexcitation. This effect was used as a fact of measuring the photocurrent in the sample volume instead of the parasitic current that is not associated with the sample. The screen has been chosen to prevent the influence of a spurious signal. It has been found that charge carriers are released when excited in the spectral absorption range of localized states of silica. Based on the Dember effect, the sign of the photoelectric response shows the type of charge carriers - an electron or a hole is mobile. Thus, a sample containing aluminum without alkali ions gives a negative signal, which indicates the diffusion of electrons at 290 K, since aluminum is an effective hole trap. An oxygen-deficient sample at 290 K provides a positive signal indicating the diffusion of holes, because the center of oxygen deficiency is an effective electron trap. This sample at 100 K provides a negative signal due to the effective self-trapping of holes.

AB Glass containing nanoparticles is attractive for plasmonics and photonics applications due to the significant optical and band gap merits. In this paper, 30/70 rim Fe3O4@MoS2 core/shell nanocomposites were synthesized with a specific surface area of 70.1050 m(2)/g. XRD spectra revealed the good crystallization peaks of Fe3O4 and MoS2 at 14.4 degrees, 30.1 degrees, 32 degrees, 35.9 degrees, 43.1 degrees, 50.8 degrees, 57.2, and 62.58 degrees, respectively, and the increases of lattice parameter of Fe3O4 and MoS2 confirmed that there was the reaction between them. The vibrations of Fe-O bonds (616 cm(-1)), Mo-S bonds (similar to 600 cm(-1)) along with A(1g) of Fe3O4 and characteristic E-2g(1) and A(1g) of MoS2 were displayed in their FT-IR and Raman spectra, respectively, indicating the good core/shell nanostructure of Fe3O4@MoS2.
   The influence of different Fe3O4@MoS2 doping amounts to glass-forming ability, structure and properties was evaluated through varies characterizations. Fe3O4@MoS2 doping amount higher than 10% could not form homogenous glassy matrix, but formed the ceramic composed of alpha-TeO2 and 2H-MoS2 crystallines. FT-IR, Raman and XPS spectra showed the vibration of MoO42-, Fe-O, PbO4, TeO4, TeO3, BO3 groups in glasses, revealing the big modification on structure and the existence of highest Mo6+ states due to high optical basicity of glass. Glass doped 2%Fe3O4@MoS2 presented good network connectivity with good thermal stability (T-x-T-g = 130 degrees) and largest magneto-optical activity (V = 0.1826 min/G.cm) because of the high field strength and high spin polarizability of Fe3O4, diamagnetism nature of Mo6+ in glass and the narrow band gap of Fe3O4 and MoS2.

Usually, the foam glasses are prepared though chemical approach where the powdered glass is mixed with foaming agents at high temperatures. However, in such approach, the emission of gaseous pollutants (e.g. CO2) from the most used foaming agents can be harmful to the environment. Thus, understanding the mechanisms of foam formation is quite important to eliminate the drawbacks afore mentioned, as well as, give us more information on the processing steps. Herein, we propose a new chemical route to obtain foam glasses from soda-lime glass waste using sodium hydroxide and borax as foaming and flow agents, respectively. The reaction mechanism was investigated by thermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis, mass spectroscopy, mercury porosimetry, optical dilatometry, X-ray diffraction, and infrared spectroscopy. At the glass transition temperature (587 degrees C), the crystallization of a new phase of hydrated sodium and calcium silicate (Na2CaSi2O6 center dot H2O) was observed. As demonstrated by mass spectrometry, when the mixture was heated to a temperature above the softening point, the foaming occurred only due to steam released from the hydrated sodium and calcium silicate. This foaming process provided a foam glass with 86% of porosity, low permeability and bulk density of 0.3 g/cm(3). The results indicate the proposed approach is environmentally safe, besides being relatively cheap and easy to prepare.

AB An essential parameter of the Classical Nucleation Theory (CNT) is the surface energy between a critical-size nucleus and the ambient phase, sigma. In condensed matter, this parameter cannot be experimentally determined independently of CNT. A common practice to obtain sigma is to assume a model for its temperature-dependence and perform a regression of the CNT equation against experimental nucleation data. The drawback of this practice is that assuming the temperature-dependence of sigma adds a bias to the analysis. Nonetheless, this practice is common because an analytical solution of the Classical Nucleation Theory with respect to sigma is not possible considering common expressions of this theory. In this article, a general numerical solution to this problem using the Lambert W function is proposed, tested, and compared with typical regression methods. The major advantage of the proposed method is that there is no need to assume a model for the temperature-dependence of sigma.

AB The corrosion behavior of Zr(55)Cu(3)oN(15)Al(10) amorphous alloy after N+ ion implantation has been investigated in 1.0 M HNO3 medium. Specimens were implanted at various fluences such as 1 x 10(16), 5 x 10(16) and 1 x 10(17) ions/cm(2) using 100 keV N+ ion beam. Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) on the N+ ion implanted samples showed the formation of ZrN crystalline phases on the surface of implanted samples along with the presence of ZrO2 and Al2O3 at higher implantation fluences. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results confirmed the presence of these crystalline phases after N+ ion implantation. Potentiodynamic polarization results revealed that the nitrogen ion implanted Zr55Cu30Ni3Al10 amorphous alloy exhibits better corrosion resistance in 1.0 M HNO3 medium at a fluence of 1 x 10(16) ions/cm(2). The field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and XPS measurements were carried out to further elucidate the changes in the surface of the treated samples.

AB Fluorotellurite glasses based on zinc and barium fluorides with total dopant concentration limited to 40 mol% in tellurite glass matrix were obtained by melt quenching technique. Explicit effects of both the zinc and barium fluorides on the tellurite glass network were observed from their response to various studies. The tendency of fluorine atoms to break the network was observed from the formation of more non-bridging sites instead of bridging sites from Raman measurements. Formation of these non-bridging fluorine sites instead of non-bridging oxygen led to an increase in the optical band gap of these samples from 3.36 eV to 3.52 eV. The reduction in the glass transition temperature from 316 degrees C to 299 degrees C observed with zinc fluoride doping is due to the breakage in the rigid network structure, while the increase from 316 degrees C to 329 degrees C with barium fluoride doping is correlated to the effect of size of barium atoms in the network. Radiation shielding properties calculated in terms of parameters like mean free path, mass attenuation coefficient etc., showed that the presence of more heavily doped elements like barium in the glass matrix led them to exhibit better shielding properties which can be utilized as replacement materials for concrete and lead based glasses as efficient shielding materials.

AB The carboxymethyl cellulose and polyvinyl alcohol (CMC/PVA) based hybrid polymer (HPe) system with different ratio of composition have been prepared via solution casting. The features of interaction between CMC and PVA were investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD), and infrared (IR) spectroscopy to disclose the reduction of crystallinity of the HPe system. Morphological properties observed by Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) confirmed the homogeneity of the HPe system. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) result explains the miscibility of the HPe system which was confirmed by means of variations in the glass transition temperature (T-g). Two degradation mechanisms were revealed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in the HPe system attributed to the decarboxylation in CMC and degradation of bond scission in PVA backbone. The blend of 80:20 compositions of CMC/PVA HPe system was found to be the optimum ratio with an increase in conductivity of CMC/PVA by one magnitude order from 10(-7) to 10(-6)S/cm with the lowest in crystallinity.

AB Corrosion behaviour of the low dielectric glass fibres in hydrochloric acid with different time and concentrations was studied. Leaching of cations, surface morphologies and structure of the low dielectric glass fibres before and after corrosion were investigated by ICP, SEM and FTIR, respectively. Both the change of weight and tensile strength of the low dielectric glass fibres in hydrochloric acid was discussed. The results showed that the decrease of weight and tensile strength of the low dielectric glass fibres with the increasing time was attributed to the leaching of the metal cations from the fibres surface which can disrupt the continuity of glass network. The equilibrium was eventually reached which was attributed to the formation of intermediate product, silica acid gel adhered to the fibres surface and complex of iron. The loss of weight and tensile strength had a maximum value after 8 h in 2 M hydrochloric acid and cracks were only generated on the surface after immersed in 2 M hydrochloric acid for 24 h. It suggested that the corrosion was significantly affected by the concentration of hydrochloric acid. The corrosion mechanism was not only attributed to ions exchange, but the hydrolysis of aluminoborate complex species.

AB Stormwater is increasingly being valued as a freshwater resource in arid regions and can provide opportunities for beneficial reuse via aquifer recharge if adequate pollutant removal can be achieved. We envision a multi-unit operation approach to capture, treat, and recharge (CTR) stormwater using low energy, cost-effective technologies appropriate for larger magnitude, less frequent events. Herein, we tested nutrient, metal, and trace organic contaminant removal of a pilot-scale CTR system in the laboratory using biochar-amended woodchip bioreactors following eight months of aging under field conditions with exposure to real stormwater. Replicate columns with woodchips and biochar (33% by weight), woodchips and straw, or woodchips only were operated with continuous, saturated flow for eight months using water from a watershed that drained an urban area consisting of residential housing and parks in Sonoma, California. After aging, columns were challenged for five months by continuous exposure to synthetic stormwater amended with 50 mu g L-1 of six trace organic contaminants (i.e., fipronil, diuron, 1H-benzotriazole, atrazine, 2,4-D, and TCEP) and five metals (Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn) frequently detected in stormwater in order to replicate the treatment unit operation of a CTR system. Throughout the eight-month aging and five-month challenge experiment, nitrate concentrations were below the detection limit after treatment (i.e., <0.05 mg N L-1). The removal efficiencies for metals in all treatments were >80% for Ni, Cu, Cd, and Pb. For Zn, about 50% removal occurred in the woodchip-biochar systems while the other systems achieved about 20% removal. No breakthrough of the trace organic compounds was observed in any biochar-containing columns. Woodchip columns without biochar removed approximately 99% of influent atrazine and 90% of influent fipronil, but exhibited relatively rapid breakthrough of TCEP, 2,4-D, 1H-benzotriazole, and diuron. The addition of straw to the woodchip columns provided no significant benefit compared to woodchips alone. Due to the lack of breakthrough of trace organics in the biochar-woodchip columns, we estimated column breakthrough with a diffusion-limited sorption model. Results of the model indicate breakthrough for the trace organics would occur between 10,000 and 32,000 pore volumes. Under ideal conditions this could be equivalent to decades of service, assuming failure by other processes (e.g., clogging, biofouling) does not occur. These results indicate that multiple contaminants can be removed in woodchip-biochar reactors employed in stormwater treatment systems with suitable flow control and that the removal of trace organic contaminants is enhanced significantly by addition of biochar.

AB Sulfide production and oilfield produced water are considered as environmental challenges in the oil industry. Iron-crosslinked sodium alginate (SA-Fe) was used to address these problems simultaneously. A pair of columns containing one coarse-sand column and one fine-sand column was designed to simulate heterogeneous rock layers and evaluate the plugging effect of SA-Fe. Generation of FeS precipitates led to decreases of sulfide in the gas phase by 45 +/- 3.2% and in the aqueous solution by 75 +/- 4.7%. The generated FeS nanoparticles and sulfate-reducing bacteria attached on the surface of the sand in the coarse-sand column to plug the pores that caused the water flow to switch from the coarse-sand column to the fine-sand column. Analysis of FeS distribution indicated that the column inlet was effectively plugged by FeS. The theoretical amount of FeS (1.19 mmol) that was determined based on sulfur balance was nearly equal to the actual amount of FeS precipitation (1.11 mmol). Additionally, water viscosity increased from 0.9 mPa s to 342 mPa s, induced by the collapse of SA-Fe gels, which reduced the difference in viscosity between oil and water to avoid viscous fingering. As a consequence, the oil recovery improved from 46 +/- 2.6% to 85 +/- 3.0% in the sand column oil-saturated recovery experiment, which contributed to the decrease of oil-normalized produced water from 70.1 +/- 4.0 to 37.5 +/- 1.3 mL water/mL oil. Therefore, this study shows that SA-Fe exhibits potential for application in controlling sulfide as well as reducing produced water. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The effect of dissolved oxygen (DO) on the degradation of methanol by ultraviolet (UV) light at 185 nm (UV-185) was examined in this study. The experiments were conducted using a bench-scale experimental apparatus that was operated under continuous conditions. In the control tests with various DO conditions, it was confirmed that UV irradiation of water without methanol produced approximately 54 mu g/L of H2O2 and removed 15%-90% of the DO. The production of H2O2 was affected by the mixing conditions within the UV reactor and the dose of UV. The degradation efficiency of methanol by UV-185 irradiation improved linearly with increasing DO concentration, with more than 90% DO consumption. The maximum total organic carbon (TOC) removal rate was observed at 100 mu g/L DO and 433 mW , sec/cm(2) , the highest DO and dosage conditions in this study. The production of H2O2 was also affected by DO concentration in the feed water, especially at the high UV dosage, in which lower H2O2 production was observed at higher DO.

AB A new in-situ pre-enrichment system was developed for trace analysis of radioactive Cs in environmental water such as rivers, ponds, and seas, where the radioactive Cs is separated into suspended substances (SS) and dissolved substances (DS). The SS component was collected as the enrichment slurry by cross-flow filtration, thereby compact systems were realized. The DS component was collected in a small cartridge filled with a non-woven fiber with immobilized adsorbent nanoparticles. The recovery rate was estimated at around 95%. The size distribution of the SS and the concentration of radioactive Cs after enrichment were the same as that of the raw water before enrichment. The condensed SS can be used for other evaluations such as ignition loss. From the field test at a pond in the Fukushima-area, the Cs concentration of the SS was found to be 4-5 times higher than that of the sediment in the same pond. The organic content estimated by ignition loss was also three times higher. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The results of this sampling campaign on pilot scale processes aim to evaluate the occurrence and behavior of trace organic micro-pollutants and metal elements during anion exchange treatment of surface water and the subsequent treatment of generated spent brine with two types of electrodialysis membrane pairs. This knowledge is relevant to assess the quality and reusability of secondary products created during brine treatment; specifically the excess of sodium chloride to be recycled onsite and the natural organic matter, mostly consisting of humic substances, which find multiple applications in the agricultural industry. This study highlights that (1) the attachment mechanism of organic micro-pollutants to anion exchange resin occurs through electrostatic interaction and the subsequent transfer through ion exchange membranes is restricted by size exclusion; and (2) the complexation of trace metals compounds with the natural organic matter partly explains their removal by anion exchange. Complexes remain stable during treatment of the brine with electrodialysis. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Data fitting approach more critical than exposure scenarios and

AB Recreational waters are a source of many diseases caused by human viral pathogens, including norovirus genogroup II (NoV GII) and enterovirus (EV). Water samples from the Arenales river in Salta, Argentina, were concentrated by ultrafiltration and analyzed for the concentrations of NoV GIl and EV by quantitative PCR. Out of 65 samples, 61 and 59 were non-detects (below the Sample Limit of Detection limit, SLOD) for EV and NoV GII, respectively. We hypothesized that a finite number of environmental samples would lead to different conclusions regarding human health risks based on how data were treated and fitted to existing distribution functions. A quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) was performed and the risk of infection was calculated using: (a) two methodological approaches to find the distributions that best fit the data sets (methods H and R), (b) four different exposure scenarios (primary contact for children and adults and secondary contact by spray inhalation ingestion and hand-to-mouth contact), and (c) five alternatives for treating censored data.
   The risk of infection for NoV GII was much higher (and exceeded in most cases the acceptable value established by the USEPA) than for EV (in almost all the scenarios within the recommended limit), mainly due to the low infectious dose of NoV. The type of methodology used to fit the monitoring data was critical for these datasets with numerous non-detects, leading to very different estimates of risk. Method R resulted in higher projected risks than Method H. Regarding the alternatives for treating censored data, replacing non-detects by a unique value like the average or median SLOD to simplify the calculations led to the loss of information about the particular characteristics of each sample. In addition, the average SLOD was highly impacted by extreme values (due to events such as precipitations or point source contamination). Instead, using the SLOD or half- SLOD captured the uniqueness of each sample since they account for the history of the sample including the concentration procedure and the detection method used. Finally, substitution of non-detects by Zero is not realistic since a negative result would be associated with a SLOD that can change by developing more efficient and sensitive methodology; hence this approach would lead to an underestimation of the health risk. Our findings suggest that in most cases the use of the half-SLOD approach is appropriate for QMRA modeling. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We have incorporated Na+-functionalized carbon quantum dots (Na-CQDs) into the polyamide layer via interfacial polymerization reaction and developed novel thin film nanocomposite (TFN) hollow fiber membranes for brackish water desalination. Comparing with the conventional thin film composite (TFC) membranes, the TFN membranes comprising Na-CQDs have a larger effective surface area, thinner polyamide layer and more hydrophilic oxygen-containing groups in the polyamide layer. Besides, the interstitial space among the polyamide chains becomes larger due to the presence of Na-CQDs. As a result, the incorporation of 1 wt% Na-CQDs into the polyamide layer could improve the pure water permeability (PWP) of the membranes from 1.74 LMH/bar to 2.56 LMH/bar by 47.1% without compromising their NaCl rejection of 97.7%. Interestingly, stabilization of the TFN hollow fiber membranes containing 1 wt% Na-CQDs at 23 bar could further promote the PWP to 4.27 LMH/bar and the salt rejection to 98.6% under the same testing conditions due to the deformation of the membranes under a high hydraulic pressure. When using a 2000 ppm NaCl aqueous solution as the feed, the optimal water flux and rejection of the newly developed TFN membranes at 15 bar are 57.65 +/- 3.26 LMH and 98.6% +/- 0.35% respectively. The Na-CQDs incorporated TFN hollow fiber membranes show promising applications in the field of brackish water desalination. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a waste stabilization pond (WSP) system to reduce pathogen contaminants in sludge. This included examining the factors that influence the fate and concentration of human pathogens and their indicators in two sludge layers. The decay rates of five study microorganisms were determined under in-situ conditions at a WSP. The background levels of fecal origin microorganisms were consistently detected (ranging: Escherichia coli 10(4) to 10(6), enterococci 10(1) to 10(3), F-specific bacteriophage (MS2) 10(1) to 10(3) and somatic coliphage 10(1) to 10(4) colony-forming units (CFU) mL(-1), as well as 10(1) to 10(2) human adenovirus gene copies mL(-1)) in the primary facultative pond. Among microorganisms tested, the bacteria generally decayed faster than adenovirus and bacteriophage, particularly in the upper sludge layer. Due to the observed regrowth of E. coli, it may have a limited value as an indicator for pathogen removal in the wastewater stabilization ponds. The abundance of E. coli numbers within the pond biome followed changes in pond temperature over time. The results of the study suggest that viruses could survive for a long time, particularly in deeper layers (>1 metre) in the sludge, during winter months (T-90 = 156 d). The presence of human pathogens in WSP sludge, in particular viruses, may be a barrier to its beneficial reuse in agriculture. The results indicate that additional treatment of sludge may be required to mitigate potential public health risks from reuse of sludge for agricultural purposes. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this study, permeate quality, membrane performance, and microbial community in a gravity-driven microfiltration (GDM) reactor and a biofiltration (BF) + GDM reactor for seawater reverse osmosis (RO) desalination pretreatment were compared at both lab-scale and pilot-scale. The presence of BF column was more efficient in removing soluble organic substances by biosorption/biodegradation, leading to superior permeate quality from BF + GUM and subsequently lower RO fouling than GDM. Compared to the biofilm-saturated anthracite media, the granular activated carbon media in BF improved the assimilable organic substances removal in BF + GDM. Although less organic substances and microbial cells were accumulated on the membrane in BF + GDM, its permeate flux was 10-20% lower than GDM. Furthermore, BF lowered the amounts and diversity of prokaryotes (due to less organic substances) and eukaryotes (due to BF media rejection and lacking of prokaryotic preys) in the membrane biofilm of BF + GDM, but did not cause significant shifts of predominant species. Thus, the lower flux in BF + GDM was attributed to the limited predation and movement of eukaryotes in membrane biofilm, which may result in the formation of less porous and compact biofilm layer. The cost analysis indicated that BF + GDM-RO requires 5.2% less operating cost and 1.5% less water production cost than GDM-RO. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB As one group of emerging pollutants, the threat of organophosphate esters (flame retardants and plasticizers, OPEs) to drinking water safety is not well recognized. Now, the oral reference dose (RfD) and oral cancer slope factor (SFO) of OPEs have been updated by USPEA, therefore the threat of OPEs to drinking water safety could be assessed. In this study, occurrence, health risk and key impact factor of OPEs in drinking water of China were analyzed covering 79 cities, whose population and gross domestic product (GDP) accounted for 28.8% and 44.1% of them in China, respectively. Total concentration of 14 common OPEs in drinking water was 13.42-265.48 ng/L. The exposure level of OPEs via ingestion of drinking water was much lower than that of food ingestion but was comparable with dust ingestion, inhalation and dermal absorption. A health assessment for OPEs via ingestion of drinking water suggested that the potential cancer risk occurred (>1.00E-6) but no obvious non-carcinogenic effects occurred (<1). Tris-(2,3-dibromopropyl) phosphate (TDBPP) contributed to about 72.4% of carcinogenic risk, which should be treated as "prior monitoring OPEs" in further studies. The occurrence and distribution of OPEs in drinking water of China have a good corresponding relationship with the Aihui-Tengchong Line, and drinking water treatment technology (DWTF) was found to be a key factor. Total OPEs, halogeno-OPEs and alkyl-OPEs in drinking water from advanced DWTT cities were much lower than those of conventional DWTT cities. Compared with conventional DWTT, advanced DWTT could reduce about 65.6% and 36.5% of carcinogenic risk and non-carcinogenic risk of OPE5, respectively. Considering the annual growth of OPEs consumption in China and world, further studies regarding the environmental threat of OPEs are required. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To evaluate and mitigate odor formation and emission in sewers, several sewer models have been developed. Although these models can predict the immediate effects of chemical dosing on odor emission control, the long-term effects due to the variation of biofllm dynamics were generally underestimated. Therefore, in this study, we developed a dynamic model to simulate sewer processes initiated by sewer. The dynamic sewer process model was calibrated and validated with experimental data collected from two pressurized mains in actual operation in Hong Kong (TCS and MH17). The results show that the dynamic model can satisfactorily predict the dynamic concentrations of sulfide and ammonium (with measured and simulated values differing by less than 6%). The model was employed to systematically assess the long-term effects of three commonly used control strategies, i.e. addition of nitrate salts, addition of biocides, and hydraulic flushing, on sulfide formation and to predict sewer biofllm compositions. The modeling results reveal that the effect of odor mitigation measures on sulfide control varied with time due to the re-establishment of sulfate-reducing bacteria community in sewer biofllm. The long-term effect of nitrate addition would be diminishing because of the growth of heterotrophic denitrifies in sewer biofilms (increased from 7% to 21% after 55 days of nitrate addition) to consumed more nitrate. After dosing biocide or hydraulic flushing in sewers, sulfide production would rebound in the following several days due to the regrowth of sewer biofilms, indicating that the optimization of odor mitigation strategies is necessary. This study highlights that the biofllm dynamics shall be involved in the simulation of odor formation and emission, to evaluate and optimize the long-term effects of mitigation measures.

AB The control of nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) challenges the implementation of partial nitritation and anammox (PN/A) processes under mainstream conditions. The aim of the present study was to understand how operating conditions impact microbial competition and the control of NOB in hybrid PN/A systems, where biofilm and flocs coexist. A hybrid PN/A moving-bed biofilm reactor (MBBR; also referred to as integrated fixed film activated sludge or IFAS) was operated at 15 degrees C on aerobically pre-treated municipal wastewater (23 mg(NH4-N) L-1). Ammonium-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and NOB were enriched primarily in the flocs, and anammox bacteria (AMX) in the biofilm. After decreasing the dissolved oxygen concentration (DO) from 1.2 to 0.17 mg(o2) L-1 - with all other operating conditions unchanged - washout of NOB from the flocs was observed. The activity of the minor NOB fraction remaining in the biofilm was suppressed at low DO. As a result, low effluent NO(3)(-)concentrations (0.5 mg(N) L-1) were consistently achieved at aerobic nitrogen removal rates (80 mg(N) L-1 d(-1)) comparable to those of conventional treatment plants. A simple dynamic mathematical model, assuming perfect biomass segregation with AOB and NOB in the flocs and AMX in the biofilm, was able to qualitatively reproduce the selective washout of NOB from the flocs in response to the decrease in DO-setpoint. Similarly, numerical simulations indicated that flocs removal is an effective operational strategy to achieve the selective washout of NOB. The direct competition for NO2- between NOB and AMX - the latter retained in the biofilm and acting as a "NO2-sink" - was identified by the model as key mechanism leading to a difference in the actual growth rates of AOB and NOB (ie.,mu(NoB)< mu(AOB) in flocs) and allowing for the selective NOB washout over a broad range of simulated sludge retention times (SRT = 6.8-24.5 d). Experimental results and model predictions demonstrate the increased operational flexibility, in terms of variables that can be easily controlled by operators, offered by hybrid systems as compared to solely biofilm systems for the control of NOB in mainstream PN/A applications.

AB Lithium is today an essential raw material for renewable energy technologies and electric mobility. Continental brines as present in the Lithium Triangle are the most abundant and the easiest to exploit lithium sources. Lithium is present in diluted concentrations together with different ions, and it is imperative to fully remove both magnesium and calcium before lithium carbonate can be precipitated. Here we use membrane electrolysis as a novel method to generate hydroxyl groups in situ in a two-chamber electrochemical cell with a side crystallizer, omitting the need for chemical addition and not leading to substantial loss of lithium rich brine. Batch electrolysis experiments fully removed more than 99.99% of both Mg2+ and Ca2+ for three different native South-American brines treated at current densities ranging from 27 to 350 A m(-2) (final concentrations were below ICP detection limit: < 0.05 mg L-1 ), For a brine containing 3090 mg L-1 of Mg-2 + and 685 mgL(-1) of Ca2+, 62 kWh m(-3) are needed for the full removal of both cations when a current density of 223 A m(-2) is employed. Most importantly, the Li+ concentration in the brine is not affected. The removed cations are precipitated as Mg(OH)(2) and Ca(OH)(2). Our process has the potential to simultaneously recover lithium, magnesium, and calcium compounds, minimizing waste production. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A novel pyrolusite fluidized bed (PFB) contactor, which we recently developed for dissolved manganese (Mn(II)) removal through surface adsorption and subsequent oxidation by free chlorine, was modeled in this study. The hydrodynamic behavior of the filter media and water in the fluidized bed was described by the axial dispersion model. The model incorporated the effects of axial mixing in the liquid and solid phases, mass transfer resistance in a laminar fluid boundary layer surrounding a media grain, and a second order oxidation rate expression. The experimental data from lab-scale and field pilot-scale contactors was adopted for the model development and its validation. For the former, the data was employed to estimate the oxidation rate constant, the mass transfer coefficient, and the axial solid phase dispersion coefficient for the model. The model simulations matched the experimental data with less than 20% error across a wide range of Mn(II) and free chlorine concentrations and hydraulic loading rates that might be encountered in a drinking water treatment plant. The sensitivity analysis showed that the time to breakthrough is most sensitive to the adsorption isotherm constants and the oxidation rate constant. These observations indicate that the alluded parameters mainly control the performance of the PFB contactor as well as the process stability. Finally, a sample application of the model to acquire operational inputs was illustrated by analyzing the effect of free chlorine concentration on Mn(II) removal performance and breakthrough time within a PFB contactor.

TI Total phosphorus-precipitation and Chlorophyll a-phosphorus

AB Phosphorus is a critical element determining trophic status and Chlorophyll a (Chl a) level in natural lakes and reservoirs, and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations can be predicted from data on phosphorus loading, hydraulic flushing rate and sedimentation. Due to their interactions with phosphorus, iron (hydr) oxides in suspended particles, originally derived from watershed soil, can strongly influence the phosphorus sedimentation and phosphorus bioavailability in water columns. Thus, the TP-precipitation relationship and the response of Chl a to TP are likely associated with watersheds soil iron. To test this assumption, we built hierarchical linear models for summer observation of natural lakes and reservoirs across a large geographic gradient. The intercepts and slopes of TP-precipitation relationships are higher in natural lakes than those in reservoirs, and these model coefficients exhibit latitudinal variations that are explained by the natural soil iron gradient. Soil iron, operating at a regional level, significantly mediates the effect of precipitation on TP concentration in both natural lakes and reservoirs, and drives the latitudinal variation in the Chl a-TP relationships for reservoirs. Our results imply that the increase in extreme precipitation events anticipated under future climate conditions may substantially mitigate eutrophication in tropical and subtropical reservoirs, but may worsen conditions in temperate lakes.

AB Cyanobacterial blooms continue to serve as one of the most serious global issues threatening water supply and human health. During cyanobacterial bloom season, a large center dot OH-yield equipment was developed and installed after coagulation settling in a 12000 ton/day drinking water treatment system in Xiamen, China. An center dot OH concentration of 7.76 similar to 57.8 mu mol/L was formed by using the oxygen activated species generated by strong ionisation discharge combining with the effect of water jet cavitation. center dot OH pre-treatment at a dose of 1.0 mg/L inactivated cyanobacterial blooms in the process of conveying bloom water within only 20s, which were then removed by sand filtration. Under SEM observation, dominant Microcystis sp. colonies connected by mucilage were dispersed into individuals that still retained the cell integrity, indicating no release of intracellular organic matter (IOM). According to a flow cytometry analysis, the main cause of .OH inactivation was the breakage of DNA strands. Meanwhile, the center dot OH-mineralized microcystin-LR was by breaking the C=C conjugated diene bond and crucial opening the persistent benzene ring to carboxylic acid miz 158.0. During center dot OH pre-treatment of 1.0 mg/L and NaCIO disinfection of 0.5 mg/L, all water quality indexes and disinfection by-product (DBP) contents complied with the Chinese Sanitary Standards for Drinking Water. Therefore, the center dot OH based on the strong ionisation discharge showed great prospect for large-scale drinking water treatment in the removal of cyanobacterial blooms while retaining cell integrity as well as the degradation of toxins.

AB Aerosolized reclaimed water can cause inflammatory responses in lung after inhalation, and endotoxin has been identified as the main inducer. Since the effects of disinfection treatments on endotoxins had conflicting results, this study explored the changes of endotoxin activity and inflammation inducing ability of reference endotoxin, gram-negative bacteria solutions and reclaimed water after ozonation respectively, and found that LAL assay based endotoxin activity and mouse inhalation exposure based inflammation examination had inconsistent results. The excessive ozone could not remove the endotoxin activity, but was able to reduce the inflammation inducing ability of free endotoxin. When treating on gram-negative strains, ozone first released the cell-bound endotoxin and caused the dramatic increase of endotoxin activity. But for the inflammatory response, despite the rapid increase at the very beginning, it immediately dropped back with further ozonation. The endotoxin aggregate size was proposed as a key regulator of the toxicity of endotoxin, which was modified by ozone oxidation. In real reclaimed water, insufficient ozone significantly enhanced the inflammatory response, but when the ozone dosages were large enough, the inflammation could be drawn back to the original level, which was consistent with the observations from pure endotoxin and bacteria. This work demonstrates that the endotoxin activity cannot predict the endotoxin-induced toxicity of ozone treated water, and low dosage of ozone treatment may even increase the health risk of reclaimed water.

AB Titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles (NPs) encounter heavy metals in the environment under different scenarios. However, the mechanism of their joint toxicity effects on Daphnia magna remains vague. This study assessed the effects of hydrophobicity of TiO2 NPs (TDONPs) and exposure scenarios on copper uptake and toxicity in Daphnia magna. In the individual exposure scenario, hydrophilic and hydrophobic TDONPs both showed no acute toxicity to Daphnia magna, whereas individual Cu2+ exposure resulted in a 30% mortality rate. Co-exposure and sequential exposure to the two types of TDONP and Cu2+ resulted in mortality rates of 40%-50%. The mechanisms of the increased Cu2+ toxicity caused by hydrophilic and hydrophobic TDONP were different. In the presence of hydrophobic TDONPs, the Cu toxicity could be attributed to the increased bioaccumulation of Cu and Ti, leading to high oxidative stress injury. The Cu toxicity due to hydrophilic TDONPs could be induced by intensified intestinal membrane damage. The obtained data suggest that the hydrophobicity of the TDONPs plays a critical role in regulating the toxicity of Cu2+. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Early detection of harmful cyanobacterial blooms allows identification of potential risk and appropriate selection of treatment techniques to prevent exposure in recreational water bodies and drinking water supplies. Here, luminescence-based adenosine triphosphate (ATP) analysis was applied to monitor and treat cultured and naturally occurring cyanobacteria cells. When evaluating lab-cultured Microcystis aeruginosa, ATP concentrations (<= 252,000 pg/mL) had improved sensitivity and correlated well (R-2 = 0.969) with optical density measurements at 730 nm (0D730; <= 0.297 cm(-1)). Following one year of monitoring of a surface water supply, ATP concentrations (<= 2000 pg/mL) correlated (R-2 = 0.791) with chlorophyll-a concentrations (<= 50 mu g/L). A preliminary early warning threshold of 175 pg ATP/mL corresponded with 5 mu g/L chlorophyll-a to initiate increased monitoring (e.g., of cyanotoxins). Following oxidation processes (i.e., chlorine, chloramine, ozone, permanganate), ATP was demonstrated as an indicator of cell lysis and a threshold value of <100 pg/mL was recommended for complete release of intracellular cyanotoxins. ATP was also used to assess efficacy of copper (Cu(II)) treatment on cyanobacteria-laden surface water. While 24-h exposure to 2.5 mg Cu(ll)/L did not impact chlorophyll-a, ATP decreased from 13,500 to 128 pg/mL indicating metabolic activity was minimized. Ultimately, ATP analysis holds promise for early detection and mitigation of potentially harmful algal blooms based on superior sensitivity, independence from cell morphology artifacts, rapid time for analysis (<10 min), and ease of deployment in the field compared to conventional methods.

AB Anammox granular sludge biotechnology has been successfully applied in the environmental engineering for nitrogen removal from wastewater. However, the startup and control of anammox process was difficult and lacks an easy-recognized indicator. In this work, the texture of anammox sludge bed in a long-term (>15 months) stable-operated and high-rate anammox reactor was investigated for the first time. The results showed that the anammox sludge bed took on the unique texture which was closely related to the biological loading rates of sludge bed at different heights of the reactor. The texture was ascribed to the pattern created by granule gradation (granules size distribution) and granule number density (spaces between granules). The sludge bed texture displayed the distinctive vision and could be characterized by the reflected light of sludge bed. The lightness indicator was found to have an excellent linear relationship with the height of anammox sludge bed. The texture of anammox sludge bed was revealed to originate from the periodic cycle of gas-driven segregation and density-based aggregation of granules. The results hint at a convenient and efficient strategy for operators to assess and control the working state of anammox system. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The granulation of anaerobic ammonium oxidation (Anammox) biomass can play a key role in developing stable and high-rate working of anammox process. It is important to know the working mechanism of anammox granular sludge (AnGS) for the optimization of reactor performance. In this study, a "lung-like breathing" determinator was invented to investigate the working behavior of AnGS in the bioreactor. The results showed that the AnGS had a regular expansion and contraction phenomenon, which was called "lung-like breathing". With the biological loading rate (BLR) at 0.114 kg-N/(kg-VSS.d), the expansion and contraction amplitude (ExCA) was 1.29 +/- 0.05%, and the expansion and contraction frequency (ExCF) was 39.3 +/- 1.6 times/h. The AnGS cultivated in a bioreactor with higher nitrogen removal rate (NRR) was found to have the higher ExCA and ExCF when determinated at the same BLR, and the "lung-like breathing" behavior of one type of AnGS was revealed to bear a significantly (p < 0.05) positive correlation with the specific anammox activity (SAA). The mass transfer flux from "lung-like breathing" was far greater than that from molecular diffusion, which was regarded as a vital mechanism for the AnGS to demonstrate its high activity. These findings provided theoretical basis and technical parameters for the optimization of anammox nitrogen removal process. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The efficiency of the ultraviolet (UV)/chlorine process strongly depends on UV wavelength because chlorine photolysis and its subsequent radical formation are highly wavelength-dependent. This study compared the degradation of humic acid (HA) during the UV/chlorine process by low pressure mercury lamp (LPUV, 254 nm) and ultraviolet light-emitting diode (UV-LED, 275 and 310 nm). The results indicated that HA degradation followed the pseudo-first-order kinetics, and the fluence-based degradation rate constants (k(obs)) were significantly affected by UV wavelength and solution pH. HA degradation decreased greatly with increasing solution pH during the UV/chlorine process at 254 nm, while the opposite trend was observed at 275 and 310 nm. In the meantime, k(obs) decreased in the order of 275 nm > 254 nm > 310 nm at pH > 7.0. The changes of chlorine molar absorption coefficients at different UV wavelengths resulted in the variation of chlorine photodecay rates (k(obs), (chlorine)), and the synergistic effects of k(obs), (chlorine) and chlorine quantum yields (Phi(chlorine)) affected HA reduction. The formation of disinfection by-products (DBPs) during the UV/chlorine process was also evaluated. A significant suppression on DBP formation and DBP-associated calculated theoretical cytotoxicity were observed at 275 nm high UV fluence and alkaline pHs. These findings in this study demonstrate that UV wavelength at 275 nm is more suitable for HA degradation by the UV/chlorine advanced oxidation process in practical applications.

AB Dissolved black carbon (DBC) involves in many biogeochemical processes in both terrestrial and aquatic environments. About 26.5 Tg of charcoal- or black carbon-derived DBC was released into aquatic environments annually, accounting to similar to 10% of the global riverine flux of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Yet the sorption behaviors of DBC and their effects on water quality in soil-water environment are poorly understood. Here we examined the molecular composition variations of DOC induced by the sorption of two biochar-derived DBCs (pyrolyzed at 300 degrees C and 500 degrees C) on three contrasting soils. The DBCs were adsorbed mainly through competitive displacement of soil surface functional groups and co-sorption with soil indigenous DOC, which varied with soil properties and the aromaticity of the DBCs. Ultra-high resolution mass spectrometry analysis indicated that compounds with rich oxygen content or unsaturated structures such as tannins and unsaturated aromatics from both DBC and soil DOC, were preferentially adsorbed on the soils in the presence of DBC. In contrast, compounds with high aromatic structures including condensed aromatics and lignins were concentrated in the aquatic phase. Molecular fractionation also occurred to the heteroatomic compounds during the sorption, and the heteroatomic dissolved organic sulphur in the DBCs was easier to be adsorbed relative to dissolved organic nitrogen. Our results suggest that DBC sorption in soil-water environment could have important implications for water quality by altering DOC molecular composition and decreasing DOC molecular diversity at the soil-water interface. This study provides essential information for understanding the behavior of DBC in the environments. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The removal of organic micropollutants (MPs) from water by means of adsorption is determined by the physicochemical properties of the adsorbent and the MPs. It is challenging to predict the removal of MPs by specific adsorbents due to the extreme diversity in physicochemical properties among MPs of interest. In this research, we established Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships (QSARs) between the physicochemical properties of a diverse set of MPs and their distribution coefficients (K-D ) measured on coconut shell activated carbon (CCAC) and porous beta-cyclodextrin polymer (P-CDP) adsorbents. We conducted batch experiments with a mixture of 200 MPs and used the data to calculate K-D values for each MP on each adsorbent under conditions of infinite dilution (i.e., low adsorbate concentrations). We used computational software to calculate 3656 molecular descriptors for each MP. We then developed and applied a model-selection workflow to identify the most significant molecular descriptors for each adsorbent. The functional stability and predictive power of the resulting QSARs were confirmed with internal cross validation and external validation. The applicability domain of the QSARs was defined based on the most significant molecular descriptors selected into each QSAR. The QSARs are predictive tools for evaluating adsorption-based water treatment processes and provide new insights into CCAC and P-CDP adsorption mechanisms. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Ecotoxicological risks of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) in surface waters are difficult to model because data on PFASs distribution in multiple compartments (sediments, suspended particles and aqueous phase) are difficult to predict. This study quantified the distribution of 21 PFASs including PFCAs: C6-C13 perfluoroalkyl carboxylates, C4, C6, C8 and C10 perfluoroalkane sulfonates, 5 perfluorooctane sulfonamide substances (FOSAM5, including EtFOSA, FOSA, MeFOSAA, EtFOSAA, FOSAA), 2 N-alkyl perfluoroalkane sulfonamidoethanols (MeFOSE and EtFOSE), bis (perfluorooctyl) phosphinic acid (C8/C8 PFPIA), and 5:3 fluorotelomer carboxylic acid (5:3 acid) between bulk water and suspended particles in water column, and pore water and benthic sediments from a tropical urban water body. The distribution of PFASs between sorbed and dissolved phase was largely dependent on the perfluoroalkyl chain length (N-CF2). PFCAs with N-C(F2) > 11 and perfluorodecane sulfonate (PFDS, N-C(F2) = 10) were found predominantly in the suspended particles and sediments. By contrast, short-chain PFASs (N-C(F2) <= 7) were detected predominantly in the dissolved phase. Sediment acts as a sink for long-chain PFASs while shortchain PFASs are more easily transported via the aqueous phase. Compared with benthic sediments, suspended particles, especially those in the top water layer, carried much higher concentrations of PFASs (by a factor of >100), indicating the stronger sorption capability of suspended particles. The wide variation in PFAS concentrations in suspended particles (Sigma PFASs concentrations: < 26.8-1,284 ng/g d.w.) suggests that some suspended particles were preloaded with different concentrations of PFASs in the water column which could highly affect the distribution of PFASs in the aquatic environment. Pore water contained 1-2 times higher concentrations of PFASs (Sigma PFASs: <20.25-159.34 ng/L) than overlying bulk water (Sigma PFASs: <14.2-79.98 ng/L), indicating the accumulation of PFASs in pore water. Distribution coefficients (K-D) were calculated using paired solids concentration and dissolved concentration in both water and sediment column (KD-SP and K-D(-SED) respectively) and were compared with values derived from a laboratory batch experiment. The averaged Log KD-SP/Log K-D(-SED) showed significant positive correlation with N-CF2, except for short-chain PFAS5 (N sub style="color:red CF2 5) which presented higher Log K-D values than estimated. The discrepancies found between K-D (Log K-D(-SP) Log K-D -desorption > Log K-D -sorption > Log K-D(-SED)) suggest that the distribution of PFASs in the field, especially between suspended particles and bulk water could not be well represented by lab results and that using the water concentrations in the bottom layer for estimation of pore water concentrations could lead to bias results.

AB The currently accepted biochemistry and bioenergetics of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) show an inefficient metabolism: only 53.8% of the energy released when a mole of ammonia is oxidised and less than two of the electrons liberated can be directed to the autotrophic anabolism. However, paradoxically, AOB seem to thrive in challenging conditions: growing readily in virtually most aerobic environment, yet limited AOB exist in pure culture. In this study, a comprehensive model of the biochemistry of the metabolism of AOB is presented. Using bioenergetics calculations and selecting the minimum estimation for the energy dissipated in each of the metabolic steps, the model predicts the highest possible true yield of 0.16 gBio/gN and a yield of 0.13 gBio/gN when cellular maintenance is considered. Observed yields should always be lower than these values but the range of experimental values in literature vary between 0.04 and 0.45 gBio/gN. In this work, we discuss if this variance of observed values for AOB growth yield could be understood if other non-considered alternative energy sources are present in the biochemistry of AOB. We analyse how the predicted maximum growth yield of AOB changes considering co-metabolism, the use of hydroxylamine as a substrate, the abiotic oxidation of NO, energy harvesting in the monooxygenase enzyme or the use of organic carbon sources.

AB In reverse osmosis (RO) system for wastewater reclamation, biofouling is an inevitable issue. Chlorine disinfection is commonly used in pretreatment to control biofouling. Some chlorine-resistant bacteria could survive after chlorine disinfection and the microbial community structure in feed water changes significantly, thus leading to the change of biofouling potential. In this study, the effect of chlorine disinfection on the biofouling of RO membrane was investigated using a laboratory cross-flow RO system. Chlorine disinfection inactivated most bacteria in feed water. However, during the operation of RO system, with the increase of chlorine dosage the flux decline became more severe after a period of operation. The final normalized flux after 21 days was 0.27, 0.26, 0.20, and 0.21 with 0, 1, 5, and 15 mg-Cl-2/L chlorine as pretreatment, respectively. After the operation, the numbers of active bacteria in the foulants on the fouled membrane were on the same level regardless of the chlorine dosage, whereas the thickness of the foulants increased with the chlorine dosage significantly. Additionally, the higher total organic carbon concentration indicated more extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) in foulants. Microbial community structure analysis showed that the abundance and the species number of chlorine-resistant bacteria increased significantly with the chlorine dosage. Typical chlorine-resistant bacteria, including Methylobacterium, Pseudomonas, Sphingomonas, and Acinetobacter, were identified as significantly distinctive genera in the foulants after the pretreatment by 15 mg-Cl-2/L chlorine. Compared with the bacteria without chlorine disinfection, these remaining bacteria produced more EPS with higher molecular weight, which could be the major contribution to more severe RO membrane fouling after chlorine disinfection.

AB A hydrodynamic separator (HS) is a common pre-treatment unit operation (UO) for separating coarser particulate matter (PM). While HS designs have disparate internal geometries, surface areas, and volumes; for a given PM granulometry this study hypothesizes there are limits to PM separation. In this study, a large group of full-scale HS units were tested with physical and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models to evaluate HS functionality based on surface overflow rate (SOR), HS geometrics (diameter, height, baffling), PM granulometry, particle size distribution (PSD), turnover volume, hydraulic capacity, and short-circuiting. Models were loaded with a hetero-disperse PSD, a common testing metric. PM separation results show that PSD variability greater than +/- 2% from this metric are different (a = 0.05). Comparing PM separation using the PSD metric across the SOR range: (1) all HS results were below the ideal SOR model, (2) above Hazen's tanks-in-series model with N= 1, (3) above plain tank designs, and (4) declined logarithmically in a +/- 10% range. Integrated across a triangular loadgraph, the SOR model significantly over-estimated PM separation for all HS units. The SOR model deviated from the validated CFD model, as PSD loadings became increasingly mono-disperse. A validated CFD model is shown to be a valuable tool to examine HS design and functionality.

AB We are still facing the knowledge gap of how the water-quality extremes (i.e. phytoplankton blooms), their causes, severity or occurrence could be directly related to the climatic oscillation. Considering that the climatic and phytoplankton concentration time series are highly non-stationary, we applied the advanced time-frequency analysis - Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD), Hilbert-Huang Spectrum (HHS) and Wavelet Analysis (WA) - to examine the variability of long term phytoplankton dynamics from 1986 to 2014 in five North Temperate Lakes (NTLs). These analysis techniques isolated five separate time series for the surface Chlorophyll a concentrations (CHL) of the five NTLs and a time series for the global climate oscillation (denoted by multivariate ENSO index, MEI), and showed that these time series generally operated at similar time scales. The long-term residual trends of decreasing were found in three lakes (i.e., BM, SP and TR lakes), which are the same to global climate dynamics (MEI). The wavelet analysis reveals strong coherency between MEI and CHL data sets for all lakes, with a periodicity of 64-months. Intuitive associations between the CHL and MEI data set showed that two types of ENSO (El Nino and La Nina) differ in their influences to CHL. Potential mechanisms relating the phytoplankton dynamics in NTLs to climatic oscillation (ENSO) were also discussed. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, we present a sequential electrochemical process for integral treatment of anaerobic sludge, combining for the first time electrochemical peroxidation (ECP) and electro-Fenton (EF). In the first step, ECP (consisting of H2O2-assisted electrocoagulation with Fe electrodes) was applied as a conditioning and stabilizing method, whose synergistic electrocoagulation/Fenton oxidation effects considerably reduced the COD, TOC and total suspended solids (TSS) by 89.3%, 75.4% and 85.6%, respectively, under optimized conditions (initial pH of 5, [H2O2]/[Fe2+] dose ratio of 5, 15.38 mA cm(-2) and 2 h treatment). Furthermore, total coliforms were completely killed within the first hour of treatment. In the second step, EF was successfully applied to mineralize the remaining organic fraction in the liquid effluent after dewatering, achieving 91.6% and 87.2% of COD and TOC removal, respectively, after 4 h of treatment under optimal conditions (pH 3 and 25 mA cm(-2)), while almost total COD and TOC removal was attained in 8 h. The Fe sludge generated at the end of the ECP treatment was easily dewatered by filtration and 20.9 g of nutrient-rich dry sludge were produced. The overall cost of the ECP-EF treatment was S$ 0.05 L-1 sludge. The combined effects of coagulation and Fenton oxidation during ECP revealed that the treatment efficiency is strongly dependent on the rheological properties of the sludge sample.

AB In wastewater recycle for potable purposes, virus removal is the most critical issue from the public health stand point. Therefore, the regulatory agency sets minimum virus removal efficiencies that must be met by combining multiple treatment processes. In most potable reuse processes, reverse osmosis (RO) plays a critical role by removing salts, viruses, dissolved organic matters, etc. It has been reported that RO removes viruses at over 6 log efficiencies, but it receives no more than 2 log credits from regulatory agencies due to the lack of sensitive integrity monitoring technologies better than conductivity-based technologies. In recent years, fluorescence-based membrane integrity monitoring (FMIM) has drawn special attention because of its simplicity, capability of continuous monitoring, and the high resolution. Lab and field studies have shown FMIM can provide around 4 log resolution for commercially available RO membranes. In this study, potential and limitation of current FMIM technology are reviewed. Further, ideas to improve the resolution beyond 4 log are suggested. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Simulating the fate of nitrogen during anaerobic digestion is required to predict the characteristics of digestates and to improve their exploitation for agricultural uses. The aim of this study was to develop a modified ADM1 model that includes bioaccessibility-based fractionation to accurately simulate the fate of nitrogen during anaerobic digestion. To this end, two complementary approaches were used: (i) changes in the bioaccessibility of protein and non-protein compounds were assessed on eight substrates during anaerobic digestion in batch experiments using the "EPS" fractionation method; (ii) experimental results were used to develop a bio-kinetic model based on anaerobic digestion model n degrees 1. This new model incorporates bioaccessibility-based fractionation in its input state variables. The model was successfully calibrated and model evaluation showed that predicted methane production, ammonium production and changes in protein and non-protein bioaccessibility during anaerobic digestion were accurate.

AB The treatment of ballast water is indispensable for preventing ecological and economic damage from the spread of invasive species. In this study, a continuous gas bubble reactor (CBR) system was developed for the efficient disinfection of microorganisms in ballast water. Ballast water treatment (BWT) in the CBR was experimentally performed to disinfect Artemia salina in seawater by using 1) pure CO(2 )and 2) mixtures with CO2, N-2, and/or SO(2 )as a simulated flue gas (CO2/N-2: 20%/80% and CO2/N-2/SO2: 19.2%/ 77.0%/3.8%). The BWT efficiency was improved with an increase in gas flowrate, residence time, gas pressure, and CO(2 )concentration in the gas. The toxicity of SO(2 )in the CO2 mixture significantly improved the mortality of microorganisms. Since good dispersion of bubbles and effective contact between bubbles and liquid were important factors in the BWT, a 100% mortality rate of microorganisms could be achieved by controlling the operating conditions in the vertical-type CBR with a counter-current flow between the gas bubbles and seawater. The CO2 gas distribution, CO2 solubility, and gas bubble size distribution in the CBR were determined using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and experimentally confirmed using a high-speed camera. Since excess gas can be recovered from a gas-liquid separator before a ballast tank, the CBR system can be operated without using any toxic or explosive gases in an eco-friendly and energy saving manner.

AB Selenium often coincides with high salinity in certain industrial wastewaters, which can be a limitation in the practical application of biological treatment. However, there are no studies on the biological treatment of selenate-containing saline wastewater. A sequencing batch reactor inoculated with activated sludge was applied to treat selenate in the presence of 3% (w/v) NaCl. Start-up of the sequencing batch reactor with a 7-day cycle duration and excessive acetate as the sole carbon source succeeded in removing above 98% and 72% soluble and solid selenium, respectively, under oxygen-limiting conditions. Further selenium removal experiments with a shorter cycle duration of 3 days and a stepwise decrease of acetate addition achieved soluble and total selenium removal efficiencies in most batches above 96% and 80%, respectively. Mass balance analysis revealed that selenate was converted into elemental selenium, most of which was accumulated in the sludge. Microscopic analyses also found that elemental selenium particles were primarily present as approximately 2 mu m large rods, with some extremely large particles above 10 mu m. Although the bacterial populations responsible for selenium removal, especially selenate reduction, could not be identified by microbial community analysis, this study reported for the first time that selenate could be biologically treated in the presence of considerable salinity, offering implications for the practical treatment of selenium in certain industrial wastewaters.

AB Cost-effective pretreatment of the highly concentrated and biorefractory coking wastewater to improve biodegradability is of significant importance, while green electrochemical technologies without external chemicals addition are charming but still challenging due to its high energy consumption. In this work, a novel multi-stages flow through peroxi-coagulation (PC) was for the first time developed with graphite felt cathode modified by graphene, showing an excellent performance in removal of 71.5% COD, 72.3% phenol and 59.4% NH3 -N and significant biodegradability enhancement with a low energy consumption as 1.2 kWh/m(3) . Compared with conventional flow PC, this process was more cost-effective due to more intensive center dot OH production and higher utilization of generated active species. Through UV spectrophotometry and GC-MS analysis, the improvement of biodegradability was attributed to the reduction of both low and high molecular weight compounds content in the coking wastewater. Comparing to the electro-Fenton, electrocoagulation and ozonation process, the proposed PC process was highly cost effective, providing a promising and new alternative for pretreatment of coking wastewater.

AB The simultaneous degradation of seventeen emerging concern pollutants in effluent from the municipal wastewater treatment plant (MWTP) of Bogota-Colombia was studied using high frequency ultrasound (375 kHz). The considered compounds in the effluent corresponded to pharmaceuticals (diclofenac, carbamazepine, venlafaxine, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, valsartan, losartan, irbesartan, sulfamethoxazole, clarithromycin, azithromycin, erythromycin, metronidazole, trimethoprim and clindamycin); cocaine and its major metabolite benzoylecgonine. Due to limitation of the MWTP for the pollutants elimination, ultrasound was applied to remove these compounds. Interestingly, ultrasonic physical action led to releasing of ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, diclofenac and sulfamethoxazole from suspended solids, whereas the chemical effects induced degradation of the rest of compounds. For the latter ones, an interesting correlation between the sonodegradation and arithmetic multiplication between hydrophobicity and concentration of pollutants was established. Afterwards, the sonochemical process was complemented with ferrous ions (sono-Fenton), ferrous ions plus light (sono-photo-Fenton) or ferrous ions plus light in presence of oxalic acid (sono-photo-Fenton/oxalic acid). Additionally, to clarify fundamental aspects of the different systems, individual treatments in distilled water of a model pollutant (valsartan) were performed. The complemented processes significantly enhanced all compounds degradation, following the order: sotto-photo-Fenton/oxalic acid > sono-photo-Fenton similar to sono-Fenton > sonochemistry. The Fe2+ addition improved the pollutants elimination by generation of more hydroxyl radicals in the solution bulk. Meanwhile, oxalic acid avoided Fe3+ precipitation favoring the iron catalytic cycle. Thus, the work demonstrates the high potentiality of the sono-photo-Fenton/oxalic acid system for the pollutants elimination in real-world wastewater matrices. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The extensive use of nanoscale zero-valent iron (nZVI) particles for groundwater treatment has been limited, in part, because of their non-selective reactivity and low mobility in aquatic environments. Herein, we describe and explore progressive changes in the reactivity and migration of aqueous dispersed nZVI particles under an applied DC electric field. Due to the applied electric field with an intensity of about 1 V cm(-1), the solution oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) remained as low as -200 mV for at least 32 days, which was in agreement with the persistence of the reduced iron species (mainly Fe(II)), and led to substantially prolonged reactivity of the original nZVI. The treatment of chlorinated ethenes (DCE > PCE > TCE) was markedly faster, individual CHC compounds were eliminated with the same kinetics and no lesser-chlorinated intermediates were accumulated, following thus the direct dechlorination scheme. When nZVI-dispersion flows towards the anode through vertical laboratory columns filled with quartz sand, significant enhancement of nZVI migration was recorded because of lower extent of nanoparticle aggregation and increased repulsion forces between the nanoparticles and the surface of silica dioxide. The results of this study have significant consequences for groundwater remediation, mainly for the treatment of slowly degradable DCE in real CHC contaminated groundwater, where it could improve the reactivity, the longevity and the migration of nZVI particles.

AB Bivalve molluscan shellfish grown in areas impacted by human faecal pollution are at risk of being contaminated with multiple enteric viruses. To minimise the public health risks associated with shellfish consumption, determining the presence of faecal contamination in shellfish and their growing waters is crucial. In this study, we evaluated the use of pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV) as an indicator of human faecal contamination in oysters, mussels, cockles and shellfish growing waters in New Zealand. Using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) the presence, and where applicable, the concentration of PMMoV was determined in faeces from 11 different animal species, influent (untreated) wastewater, shellfish and shellfish growing waters. Non-human faecal samples (from seagull, Canada goose, black swan and dog) were RT-qPCR positive for PMMoV. The faecal source specificity of PMMoV was 0.83 (maximum value of 1) when 'detected but not quantifiable' (DNQ) values were used. However, when 'lower limit of quantification' (LLOQ) values were used, the specificity increased to 0.92. The PMMoV concentration in influent wastewater (n = 10) ranged from 6.3 to 7.7 log(10) genome copies (GC)/1. with a mean (+/- standard deviation) of 7.1 +/- 0.5 log(10) GC/L. The overall occurrence of PMMoV in shellfish and shellfish growing waters from four different areas was 46/51 (90%) and 29/52 (56%), respectively. Of the cockles collected from an area known to be impacted by effluent wastewater, 14/14 (100%) contained PMMoV concentrations above the LLOQ. In contrast, only 13/37 (35%) shellfish and 6/52 (11.5%) growing water samples collected from three areas with low anthropogenic impact contained PMMoV concentrations above the LLOQ. The high concentration of PMMoV in influent wastewater indicates that PMMoV may be a promising indicator of human faecal contamination. The presence of PMMoV in shellfish and growing waters with a low anthropogenic impact may be of avian origin, and this needs to be considered if using PMMoV for monitoring shellfish and shellfish growing water quality in New Zealand.

AB Water utilities must control microbial regrowth in the distribution system to protect public health. In this study, an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-based biomass production potential test using indigenous bacterial communities were used to evaluate regrowth potential following ozonation with either biofiltration (BF) or sustained chlorination (SCl2). Two full-scale water treatment plants with different upstream processes (i.e., WTP-BF: ozonation, coagulation/flocculation, biofiltration, UV irradiation, chlorination; and WTP-SCl2: ozonation, chlorination, coagulation/flocculation, filtration, chlorination) were compared. Characterization of indigenous bacteria using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, qPCR, and cellular ATP (cATP) showed microbial diversity changes across treatment, biomass sloughing from biofilters (effluent cATP = 30 +/- 1 ng/L), and disinfection by chlorine (cATP < 1 ng/L). For both WTPs, 14-day cumulative biomass production (CBPt = Sigma ATP(t) x Delta t) was highest for ozonated water samples (CBP14 = 1.2 x 10(3) -3.0 x 10(3) d ngATP/L). CBP further increased with increasing ozone dose due to production of more biodegradable carbon. Growth promotion by carbon was confirmed from the consumption of ozonation byproducts (carboxylic acids, aldehydes) and the increase in CBP (9.5 x 10(2)-2.9 x 10(3) d ngATP/L) after addition of 50-300 mu gC/L acetate. Ozone followed by sustained chlorination (WTP-SCl2) effectively controlled biomass growth across the treatment process (CBP14 <10 d ngATP/L). In contrast, ozone followed by biofiltration (WTP-BF) reduced regrowth potential by 30% (biofilter influent CBP14 =1.3 x 10(3) d ngATP/L; biofilter effluent CBP14 = 9.3 x 10(2) d ngATP/L). After adding chlorine to the biofilter effluent, CBP14 was reduced to <10 d ngATP/L. Lastly, online ATP measurements confirmed the discrete measurements and improved identification of the cATP peak and growth phases of indigenous bacteria. (C) 2019 The Author(s).

AB We examined the relationship between downstream algal growth potential and the spatial environmental factors of both upland areas and stream buffer zones using spatial analysis and generalized additive models (GAMS). The models employed site-representative concentrations of chlorophyll a (Chia) from a total of 688 national water quality monitoring stations and the spatial factors of the corresponding 688 watersheds. The spatial environmental factors included topography, climate, land use class, soil type, and proximity of the monitoring station to the weir downstream and wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). The explanatory power (adjusted R-2 or R-adj(2)) of the models was used to compare different spatial influential scales defined by stream buffers and upstream circular buffers. The spatial environmental factors of the entire watershed area better explained the inter-station variation in Chl-a than did those of the stream buffer and/or upstream circular buffer areas. However, the spatial environmental factors of watershed areas more than 25 km upstream circular buffer zones had only minor influence on the explainability of the models with regards to the inter-station variation in Chl-a levels. Generally, land use patterns were more strongly related to the inter-station Chl-a variation than were point sources of pollutants such as WWTPs. The two most influencing land uses on the inter-station Chl-a variation were urban and agricultural land uses, with varying relative contributions depending on the spatial influential scale: In general relative contribution of urban land use was larger at a larger spatial influential scale while that of agricultural land use showed an opposite trend. In addition, the proximity to the weir downstream explained high Chl-a concentrations in the stream water. Relative importance and causal effects of the spatial environmental variables to instream Chl-a were established based on this national scale correlative analysis, leading to decision-making with the goal of controlling instream algal growth.

AB This study illustrated the preparation, characterization and the use of carbon xerogel materials for the adsorption of acid-extractable fractions (AEF) and naphthenic acids (NAs) from oil sands process water (OSPW). Adsorption results demonstrated that the mesoporous carbonaceous material can successfully be used to adsorb persistent and toxic organic contaminants from OSPW. Carbon xerogel (CX) made at pH 5.5 showed high surface area (573 m(2)/g) and removed a larger amount of AEF than CX made at pH 6.9 (391 m(2)/g). The adsorption equilibrium was reached by 24 h for both AEF and classical NAs. 74.6% of AEF and 88.8% of classical NAs were removed by CX5.5 during 24-h adsorption. With respect to classical NAs, a larger the carbon number resulted in higher NA removal. Carbon number had more influence on NA removal when compared with hydrogen deficiency resulting from rings or unsaturated bonding formation (-Z number). The equilibrium adsorption capacity was found to be 15 mg AEF/g and 7.8 mg NAsig for CX5.5. Adsorption of AEF and classical NAs onto CX5.5 followed pseudo-second order kinetics. With respect to diffusion of AEF and NAs, there were three distinct diffusion regions: bulk, film and pore. Pore diffusion had the lowest rate constant in all cases analyzed and was thus the rate limiting step. The results of this study showed that a mesoporous carbonaceous material such as CX may have the potential to be utilized in a fixed bed adsorption/filtration systems for continuous treatment of OSPW or as a semipassive treatment method in pit lakes for the removal of organic constituents from OSPW.

AB This paper proposes a novel neural network architecture inspired by the nonstandard form proposed by Beylkin et al. (1991) [7]. The nonstandard form is a highly effective wavelet-based compression scheme for linear integral operators. In this work, we first represent the matrix-vector product algorithm of the nonstandard form as a linear neural network where every scale of the multiresolution computation is carried out by a locally connected linear sub-network. In order to address nonlinear problems, we propose an extension, called BCR-Net, by replacing each linear sub-network with a deeper and more powerful nonlinear one. Numerical results demonstrate the efficiency of the new architecture by approximating nonlinear maps that arise in homogenization theory and stochastic computation. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB A pressure-correction algorithm is presented for compressible fluid flow regimes. It is well-suited to simulate flows at all levels of Mach number with smooth and discontinuous flow field changes, by providing a precise representation of convective transport and acoustic propagation. The co-located finite volume space discretization is used with the AUSM flux splitting. It is demonstrated that two ingredients are essential for obtaining good quality solutions: the presence of an inertia term in the face velocity expression; a velocity difference diffusive term in the face pressure expression, with a correct Mach number scaling to recover the hydrodynamic and acoustic low Mach number limits. To meet these two requirements, a new flux scheme, named MIAU, for Momentum Interpolation with Advection Upstream splitting is proposed. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, a new framework for the efficient and accurate solutions of three dimensional (3D) dynamic coupled thermoelasticity problems is presented. In our computations, the Krylov deferred correction (KDC) method, a pseudo-spectral type collocation technique, is introduced to perform the large-scale and long-time temporal simulations. The generalized finite difference method (GFDM), a relatively new meshless method, is then adopted to solve the resulting boundary-value problems. The GFDM uses the Taylor series expansions and the moving least squares approximation to derive explicit formulae for the required partial derivatives of unknown variables. The method, thus, is truly meshless that can be applied for solving problems merely defined over irregular clouds of points. For problem with complicated geometries, this paper also examines a new distance criterion for adaptive selection of nodes in the GFDM simulations. Preliminary numerical experiments show that the KDC accelerated GFDM methods are very promising for accurate and efficient long-time and large-scale dynamic simulations. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB Solving the interface positioning equation is the key procedure of the PLIC-VoF methods. Most of previous research only focused on the planar constant calculation and paid less attention to the relationship between the planar constant and the approximate interface orientation. The latter issue is important especially for the second order iteration based PLIC-VoF method, such as the MoF and LVIRA method. In these methods, the most accurate interface orientation is calculated through an iterative procedure, so the interface positioning equation has to be solved multiple times for the given volume fraction with different interface orientations. In this situation, if the incremental relation between the planar constant and the interface orientation is known, a predicted planar constant can be estimated. In this paper, we deduce the analytical partial derivatives of the planar constant with respect to the interface orientation and use them to predict the planar constant. A predicted-Newton's method is proposed to solve the interface positioning equation which takes the predicted planar constant as the initial guess. A great deal of numerical tests are also presented in this paper to verify the robustness of the new scheme. The efficiency of the proposed predicted-Newton's method is compared with the commonly used secant/bisection method by Ahn and Shashkov, and the numerical results indicate that the new method can reduce the iteration steps by 60% similar to 66% in solving the interface positioning equation and reduce the CPU time by 32% similar to 39% when implemented in the MoF method.

AB We present a space-time Cut Finite Element Method (CutFEM) for the time-dependent Navier-Stokes equations involving two immiscible incompressible fluids with different viscosities, densities, and with surface tension. The numerical method is able to accurately capture the strong discontinuity in the pressure and the weak discontinuity in the velocity field across evolving interfaces without re-meshing processes or regularization of the problem. We combine the strategy proposed in P. Hansbo et al. (2014) [14] for the Stokes equations with a stationary interface and the space-time strategy presented in P. Hansbo et al. (2016) [20]. We also propose a strategy for computing high order approximations of the surface tension force by computing a stabilized mean curvature vector. The presented space-time CutFEM uses a fixed mesh but includes stabilization terms that control the condition number of the resulting system matrix independently of the position of the interface, ensure stability and a convenient implementation of the space-time method based on quadrature in time. Numerical experiments in two and three space dimensions show that the numerical method is able to accurately capture the discontinuities in the pressure and the velocity field across evolving interfaces without requiring the mesh to be conformed to the interface and with good stability properties.

Unlike the conventional practice that approximates the system by a large commensurate supercell, our algorithm directly discretizes the eigenvalue problems under the framework of a plane wave method. The emerging ergodicity and the interpretation from higher dimensions give rise to many unique features compared to what we have been familiar with in the periodic systems. The numerical results of 1D and 2D quantum eigenvalue problems are presented to show the reliability and efficiency of our algorithm. Furthermore, the extension of our algorithm to full Kohn-Sham density functional theory calculations is discussed. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID SPH METHOD; GAS
AB In this work, we propose a smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) model that can describe multi-fluid flows that are mutually miscible. The model is constructed on the basis of a one-fluid description by correlating relative motions between component fluids to mass transfer between SPH particles. The model can represent complicated phenomena in a multi-fluid by incorporating the Maxwell-Stefan diffusion model and by solving n continuity and momentum equations. The diffusion term and advection term in the model are separately investigated and validated through various benchmarking cases. The results show that the model can successfully describe behaviors of miscible multi-fluids below a particle-resolution scale. The model is expected to be able to describe not only a gaseous mixture, but also a liquid mixture. It is also possible to model the reactive gas or liquid transport by extending the model to incorporate the reaction kinetics. Study of the latter problem is currently underway.

AB To address the problem of different time scales present in the simulation of solute transport through systems with a complex permeability structure such as fractured porous rocks, we propose a parallel discrete event simulation (DES) algorithm based on local time stepping criteria, specifically developed for the hybrid finite-element node-centred finite volume (FV) framework. A preemptive-event-processing (PEP) approach is applied to synchronise discrete events with sufficiently close time stamps, thereby facilitating the parallelisation for shared memory architectures. The accuracy of the presented DES-PEP scheme is first verified against the analytical solution of a 1D advection equation with spatially variable coefficients. The DES scheme is then applied to simulate tracer advection through a 3D model of highly heterogeneous fractured rock represented by an unstructured adaptively refined mesh with over 1 million elements. DES produces results comparable to those of a conventional time-driven simulation (TDS), but uses less than 1% of the execution time. Analysis of event distributions shows that updates occur almost exclusively in a small number of FV cells marked by order-of-magnitudes faster fluid flow and advection-dominated transfer, while slow-flowing cells remain inactive and excluded from computations. This focusing of the computational effort leads to high simulation efficiency while simultaneously diminishing round-off errors. Scalability tests with a parallel version of DES on shared memory demonstrate further computational speedups mirroring the increased number of threads. With the use of 20 threads, execution time is reduced from 42.5 days (with TDS) to only 1.5 hours, equivalent to a speedup of over 670. This parallel DES algorithm therefore enables efficient multi-core simulation of solute transport in heterogeneous geologically realistic systems. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Particulate flow has a wide range of industrial applications and is frequently modeled with coupled CFD-DEM approaches. Herein, we first identified a simulation gap between the resolved CFD-DEM and unresolved CFD-DEM through a size effect study. Then we analyzed the error sources of the conventional unresolved CFD-DEM when modeling particulate flows with comparable mesh size and particle diameter. We finally developed a semi-resolved CFD-DEM model, which combines the advantages of both resolved and unresolved CFD-DEM models. The semi-resolved CFD-DEM uses a drag force model to characterize particle-fluid interaction, while the relative velocity in the drag force model is corrected through kernel-based approximations on the neighboring fluid cells rather than simply taking values in the local cell containing the concerned particle, and the void fraction in the force model is corrected as well. In order to improve the computational efficiency, a Hilbert curve based searching strategy is used to identify the fluid cells covered by the influencing area of the kernel function. A number of numerical simulations have been conducted and numerical results from different CFD-DEM approaches are compared together with experimental data. It is shown that the presented semi-resolved CFD-DEM bridges the simulation gap between the resolved CFD-DEM and unresolved CFD-DEM while it is as efficient as the conventional unresolved CFD-DEM and as accurate as the resolved CFD-DEM.

AB New time integration methods are proposed for simulating incompressible multiphase flow in pipelines described by the one-dimensional two-fluid model. The methodology is based on 'half-explicit' Runge-Kutta methods, being explicit for the mass and momentum equations and implicit for the volume constraint. These half-explicit methods are constraint-consistent, i.e., they satisfy the hidden constraints of the two-fluid model, namely the volumetric flow (incompressibility) constraint and the Poisson equation for the pressure. A novel analysis shows that these hidden constraints are present in the continuous, semidiscrete, and fully discrete equations.
   Next to constraint-consistency, the new methods are conservative: the original mass and momentum equations are solved, and the proper shock conditions are satisfied; efficient: the implicit constraint is rewritten into a pressure Poisson equation, and the time step for the explicit part is restricted by a CFL condition based on the convective wave speeds; and accurate: achieving high order temporal accuracy for all solution components (masses, velocities, and pressure). High-order accuracy is obtained by constructing a new third-order Runge-Kutta method that satisfies the additional order conditions arising from the presence of the constraint in combination with time-dependent boundary conditions.
   Two test cases (Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities in a pipeline and liquid sloshing in a cylindrical tank) show that for time-independent boundary conditions the half-explicit formulation with a classic fourth-order Runge-Kutta method accurately integrates the two-fluid model equations in time while preserving all constraints. A third test case (ramp-up of gas production in a multiphase pipeline) shows that our new third-order method is preferred for cases featuring time-dependent boundary conditions.

AB We present effective numerical algorithms for approximating unknown governing differential equations from measurement data. We employ a set of standard basis functions, e.g., polynomials, to approximate the governing equation with high accuracy. Upon recasting the problem into a function approximation problem, we discuss several important aspects for accurate approximation. Most notably, we discuss the importance of using a large number of short bursts of trajectory data, rather than using data from a single long trajectory. Several options for the numerical algorithms to perform accurate approximation are then presented, along with an error estimate of the final equation approximation. We then present an extensive set of numerical examples of both linear and nonlinear systems to demonstrate the properties and effectiveness of our equation approximation algorithms.

AB Numerical simulation technique of two-dimensional variable-order time fractional advection-diffusion equation is developed in this paper using radial basis function-based differential quadrature method (RBF-DQ). To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first application of this method to variable-order time fractional advection-diffusion equations. For the general case of irregular geometries, the meshless local form of RBF-DQ is used and the multiquadric type of radial basis functions is selected for the computations. This approach allows one to define a reconstruction of the local radial basis functions to treat accurately both the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions on the irregular boundaries. The method is validated by the well documented test examples involving variable-order fractional modeling of air pollution. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method provides accurate solutions for two-dimensional variable-order time fractional advection-diffusion equations. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB Many processes in science and engineering can be described by partial differential equations (PDEs). Traditionally, PDEs are derived by considering first principles of physics to derive the relations between the involved physical quantities of interest. A different approach is to measure the quantities of interest and use deep learning to reverse engineer the PDEs which are describing the physical process.
   In this paper we use machine learning, and deep learning in particular, to discover PDEs hidden in complex data sets from measurement data. We include examples of data from a known model problem, and real data from weather station measurements. We show how necessary transformations of the input data amounts to coordinate transformations in the discovered PDE, and we elaborate on feature and model selection. It is shown that the dynamics of a non-linear, second order PDE can be accurately described by an ordinary differential equation which is automatically discovered by our deep learning algorithm. Even more interestingly, we show that similar results apply in the context of more complex simulations of the Swedish temperature distribution. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We study a space-fractional Allen-Cahn phase-field model in which the fractional Laplacian is defined to be an infinitesimal generator of an alpha-stable Levy process with 0 < alpha < 2. Compared with the Allen-Cahn model using the Riemann-Liouville (R-L) fractional derivatives in the literature, the current model enjoys the following advantages: (1) it can control the sharpness and the decaying behavior of the interface via the tunable order parameter alpha as the Riemann-Liouville fractional model does; (2) it generates numerical solutions with sharper interfaces than the Riemann-Liouville fractional Allen-Cahn model with the same 1 < alpha < 2, and it can generate numerical solutions with even sharper interfaces as it also applies to the case for 0 < alpha < 1; (3) as alpha -> 2(-), it provides good approximations to the classical Allen-Cahn model as the fractional Riemann-Liouville model does; (4) it is rotational invariant; and (5) it has a much slower mass decaying rate than the Riemann-Liouville fractional model. We also propose and analyze a first order in time and second order in space energy stable finite difference scheme. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Neural-net-induced Gaussian process (NNGP) regression inherits both the high expressivity of deep neural networks (deep NNs) as well as the uncertainty quantification property of Gaussian processes (GPs). We generalize the current NNGP to first include a larger number of hyperparameters and subsequently train the model by maximum likelihood estimation. Unlike previous works on NNGP that targeted classification, here we apply the generalized NNGP to function approximation and to solving partial differential equations (PDEs). Specifically, we develop an analytical iteration formula to compute the covariance function of GP induced by deep NN with an error-function nonlinearity. We compare the performance of the generalized NNGP for function approximations and PDE solutions with those of GPs and fully-connected NNs. We observe that for smooth functions the generalized NNGP can yield the same order of accuracy with GP, while both NNGP and GP outperform deep NN. For non-smooth functions, the generalized NNGP is superior to GP and comparable or superior to deep NN. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A non-intrusive reduced-basis (RB) method is proposed for parametrized unsteady flows. A set of reduced basis functions are extracted from a collection of high-fidelity solutions via a proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), and the coefficients of the reduced basis functions are recovered by a feedforward neural network (NN). As a regression model of the RB method for unsteady flows, the neural network approximates the map between the time/parameter value and the projection coefficients of the high-fidelity solution onto the reduced space. The generation of the reduced basis and the training of the NN are accomplished in the offline stage, thus the RB solution of a new time/parameter value can be recovered via direct outputs of the NN in the online stage. Due to its non-intrusive nature, the proposed RB method, referred as the POD-NN, fully decouples the online stage and the high-fidelity scheme, and is thus able to provide fast and reliable solutions of complex unsteady flows. To test this assertion, the POD-NN method is applied to the reduced order modeling (ROM) of the quasi-one dimensional Continuously Variable Resonance Combustor (CVRC) flow. Numerical results demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the POD-NN method. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Second and higher order numerical approximations of conservation laws for vector fields call for the use of limiting techniques based on generalized monotonicity criteria. In this paper, we introduce a family of directional vertex-based slope limiters for tensorvalued gradients of formally second-order accurate piecewise-linear discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretizations. The proposed methodology enforces local maximum principles for scalar products corresponding to projections of a vector field onto the unit vectors of a frame-invariant orthogonal basis. In particular, we consider anisotropic limiters based on singular value decompositions and the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization procedure. The proposed extension to hyperbolic systems features a sequential limiting strategy and a global invariant domain fix. The pros and cons of different approaches to vector limiting are illustrated by the results of numerical studies for the two-dimensional shallow water equations and for the Euler equations of gas dynamics.

AB In many spinning processes, as for example in dry spinning, solvent evaporates out of the spun jets and leads to thinning and solidification of the produced fibers. Such production processes are significantly driven by the interaction of the fibers with the surrounding airflow. Faced with industrial applications producing up to several hundred fibers simultaneously, the direct numerical simulation of the three-dimensional multiphase, multiscale problem is computationally extremely demanding and thus in general not possible. In this paper, we hence propose a dimensionally reduced, efficiently evaluable fiber model that enables the realization of fiber-air interactions in a two-way coupling with airflow computations. For viscous dry spinning of an uni-axial two-phase flow, we deduce one-dimensional equations for fiber velocity and stress from cross-sectional averaging and combine them with two-dimensional advection-diffusion equations for polymer mass fraction and temperature revealing the radial effects that are observably present in experiments. For the numerical treatment of the resulting parametric boundary value problem composed of one-dimensional ordinary differential equations and two-dimensional partial differential equations we develop an iterative coupling algorithm. The solution of the advection-diffusion equations is implicitly given in terms of Green's functions and leads for the surface values to Volterra integral equations of second kind with singular kernel, which we can solve very efficiently by the product integration method. For the ordinary differential equations a suitable collocation-continuation procedure is presented. Compared with the referential solution of a three-dimensional setting, the numerical results are very convincing. They provide a good approximation while drastically reducing the computational time. This efficiency allows the two-way coupled simulation of industrial dry spinning in airflows for which we present results for the first time in literature. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The Vlasov-Poisson system, modeling the evolution of non-collisional plasmas in the electrostatic limit, is approximated by a semi-Lagrangian technique. Spectral methods of periodic type are implemented through a collocation approach. Groups of particles are represented by the Fourier Lagrangian basis and evolve, for a single timestep, along a high-order accurate representation of the local characteristic lines. The time-advancing technique is based on truncated Taylor series that can be, in principle, of any order of accuracy. A variant is obtained by coupling the phase space discretization with high-order accurate Backward Differentiation Formulas (BDF). At each timestep, particle displacements are reinterpolated and expressed in the original basis to guarantee the order of accuracy in all the variables at relatively low costs. Thus, these techniques combine the excellent features of spectral approximations with high-order time integration. The resulting method has excellent conservation properties. Indeed, it can be proven that the total number of particles, proportional to the total mass and charge, is conserved up to the machine precision. Series of numerical experiments are performed in order to assess the real performance. In particular, comparisons with standard benchmarks are examined. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The radiative transport equation accurately describes light transport in participating media, though analytic solutions are known only for simple geometries. We present a pseudospectral technique to efficiently compute numerical solutions to large-scale time-dependent and steady-state problems, with anisotropic scattering. A perfectly matched layer is proposed which allows this method to be applied in arbitrarily complex heterogeneous media. Our GPU-accelerated implementation of the technique is validated by comparison with a Monte-Carlo simulation, demonstrating excellent agreement. (C) 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB We introduce a model for the mass transfer of molecular activators and inhibitors in two media separated by an interface, and study its interaction with the deformations exhibited by the two-layer skin tissue where they occur. The mathematical model results in a system of nonlinear advection-diffusion-reaction equations including cross-diffusion, and coupled with an interface elasticity problem. We propose a Galerkin method for the discretisation of the set of governing equations, involving also a suitable Newton linearisation, partitioned techniques, non-overlapping Schwarz alternating schemes, and high-order adaptive time stepping algorithms. The experimental accuracy and robustness of the proposed partitioned numerical methods is assessed, and some illustrating tests in 2D and 3D are provided to exemplify the coupling effects between the mechanical properties and the advectiondiffusion-reaction interactions involving the two separate layers.

AB The setting up of the Science Policy Research Unit (SPRU) at Sussex University 50 years ago represented a "transformative change" in the research on science policy and the understanding of the nature and origin of technological change and innovation studies. It influenced policymakers across the world in both the mature Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries and the developing world. It made the topic of science, technology and innovation (STI) familiar to business studies scholars. Today though, the analysis of STI appears to be somewhat in crisis. On the one hand, there is growing evidence that the growth and welfare gains of new technologies and innovation are no longer forthcoming in an automatic "trickle-down" fashion. The knowledge and technology diffusion "machine" appears broken. On the other hand, there are growing environmental concerns about the negative externalities of unsustainable fossil-fuel-based growth as industrialization spreads across the globe. STI policy appears somehow stuck in an industrial efficiency and consumerism mode that is unable to address in a satisfactory way the impact of such negative externalities. Can the broader historical approach as popularized within the so-called Science and Technology Studies (STS) tradition provide additional, complementary insights? Yes, if STI and STS scholars are prepared to leave their respective conceptual comfort zones and address in complementary fashion some of the major societal policy challenges confronting science, technology and innovation policy today.

AB A techno-economic paradigm embraces a whole constellation of technically and economically interrelated innovations and influences most industries and an entire phase of economic development. Its full potential to drive and shape economic growth can only be realized after far-reaching reforms have been made in the "socio-institutional frameworks" of major economies and the world economy. In close association with ICT, biotechnology - or the trio of biotechnologies: red (biomedicine), green (plant breeding) and white (industrial)- is now capable of such a role, although the necessary reforms remain to be made. This paper shows how far and in what sense it has reached technological maturity, and what "mismatches" between it and the socio-institutional framework are obstructing its further development and diffusion. It argues that biotechnology (green and white) is needed to play a key role in the struggle against climate change - which in turn can be expected to draw out its potential.

AB A holistic innovation policy is defined in this article as a policy that integrates all public actions that influence or may influence innovation processes. The Swedish National Innovation Council (NIC) was created by the Swedish Prime Minister, Stefan Lofven, in February 2015. It is personally chaired by the prime minister. Another atypical characteristic of the Swedish NIC is that it has a dominant and wide focus on innovation policy. In other countries, such councils focus predominantly on science and/or research policy and treat innovation policy, if at all, as an "appendix" to research policy. The purpose of this article is to answer the following four questions:
   1. Has Swedish innovation policy recently become more holistic?
   2. Has the Swedish National Innovation Council (NIC) had a role in the transition towards a holistic innovation policy?
   3. Have conceptual specifications and advancements played a role in the changes in Swedish innovation policy?
   4. Can the Swedish NIC serve as a role model for other countries and regions in their attempts to initiate and govern a holistic innovation policy?

AB This paper presents an analytical framework for assessing the emergence of a new policy paradigm labelled "transformative innovation policy", which can be seen as layered upon, but not fully replacing, earlier policy paradigms of science and technology policy and innovation systems policy. The paper establishes conceptual diversity in this emerging policy paradigm. Despite a common agenda for transformative change, there are notable differences concerning the understanding of the innovation process. Two global initiatives to promote such new innovation policies, Mission Innovation and the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy, are used to illustrate how different articulations of transformative innovation policy are expressed in practice. These may be seen as a positive expression of the breadth of the emerging policy paradigm. While there are grounds for such a positive reading, this paper ends with a caution by stressing the political nature of paradigm change and the strong legacy of an economic, firm-centred and technology-oriented tradition in innovation policy. It makes a plea for more emphasis on a broader conceptualization of transformative innovation, and suggests that a socio-technical understanding of innovation provides several appropriate analytical concepts that can help to shape our thinking and understanding of transformative innovation policy.

AB As innovation is increasingly becoming an imperative for policymakers around the globe, there is a growing tendency to frame policy problems as problems of innovation. This logic suggests that we are unable to address grand societal challenges and ensure economic competitiveness because our societies, institutions, scientific activities or individual predispositions are not sufficiently geared towards innovation. In this paper, we analyze this "deficit model" of innovation in which a lack of innovation is routinely invoked as the main obstacle to social progress. Drawing parallels to research on the deficit model of public understanding of science (PUS), we develop a theoretical framework that captures the dynamics and normative implications of deficit construction, highlighting five salient dimensions: problem diagnoses, proposed remedies, the role of expertise, implied social orders, and measures of success. We apply this framework to three empirical case studies of recent innovation strategies in Luxembourg, Singapore, and Denmark. Attention to this deficit framing around innovation is important, we argue, because it is an essential part of how innovation transforms societies in the 21st century: not only through new technological possibilities or economic growth, but also by shaping public discourse, narrowing policy options, and legitimizing major institutional interventions. The implied pro-innovation bias tends to marginalize other rationales, values, and social functions that do not explicitly support innovation. It further delegates decisions about sweeping social reconfigurations to innovation experts, which raises questions of accountability and democratic governance. Experiences from the history of PUS suggest that, without a dedicated effort to transform innovation policy into a more democratic, inclusive, and explicitly political field, the present deficit logic and its technocratic overtones risks significant social and political conflict.

ID TECHNOLOGICAL CAPABILITIES; 3 FRAMES; TAXONOMY; DYNAMICS
AB One of the most significant results of the qualitative literature on national systems of innovation (NSIs) is that different systemic arrangements (i.e. configurations of actors and institutions) can deliver similar levels of innovative performance. Using factor analysis on a novel dataset of 29 quantitative indicators of innovative activities we provide an empirical characterization of the structure of European NSIs over the last ten years. Our results cast doubt on the empirical significance of the "equifinality" of heterogeneous systemic arrangements in the context of NSI. Innovation systems show inherent complexity, which leads to a high level of complementarity among their constituent components and configuration. This result implies that successful innovation policies should be systemic, leaving little flexibility in policy design and scope.

AB Shareholder value, short-term strategies, quarterly financial reports, and performance-based remuneration are strong indicators of a financial market-oriented company. It is questionable whether innovativeness and sustainable innovation capabilities can be maintained in times of financialization focused on short-term efficiency instead of free space for creativity and learning. Using the example of established German industrial companies, I examined the extent to which financialization and financial market actors steer innovation strategies and practices. In-depth interviews with companies, cluster managers and banks and reviews of financing data do not reveal a direct influence of financial investors on innovation activities. On the contrary, companies' managements still have the power to decide how much financial control and standardization they allow for their companies' innovation practices. The pressure on these German companies to innovate comes from their strong market orientation rather than from financialization.

   CHALLENGES; INSIGHTS; MODELS
AB Market creation is moving to the centre of mission-oriented innovation policy. This is particularly visible in the space sector. Agencies such as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the European Space Agency (ESA) are developing market-creating innovation policies in response to (a) the increasing emphasis on societal grand challenges, (b) the rise of a new wave of space companies (often referred to as "New Space") and (c) the global trend towards interconnecting and interlinking of industries (a trend referred to as Industry 4.0). In this paper we explore the changing nature of mission-oriented innovation policies for market creation for two agencies, NASA and ESA. For these agencies, earlier mission-oriented policies focused on clear challenges with identifiable concrete problems and directed by a strong centralized agency. Contrast this with today, with broadly defined grand challenges, decentralized innovation systems with mixed top-down and bottom-up problem definition. We describe the current drivers and pressures that are creating a window for policy change, and we present examples of how NASA and ESA are responding to these pressures and use this exploration to dig deeper into the evolving frames of market-creating innovation policy in the space sector to identify the challenges for such policies and to further articulate a research agenda.

AB To what extent is scientific research related to societal needs? To answer this crucial question systematically we need to contrast indicators of research priorities with indicators of societal needs. We focus on rice research and technology between 1983 and 2012. We combine quantitative methods that allow investigation of the relation between 'revealed' research priorities and 'revealed' societal demands, measured respectively by research output (publications) and national accounts of rice use and farmers' and consumers' rice-related needs. We employ new bibliometric data, methods and indicators to identify countries' main rice research topics (priorities) from publications. For a panel of countries, we estimate the relation between revealed research priorities and revealed demands. We find that, across countries and time, societal demands explain a country's research trajectory to a limited extent. Some research priorities are nicely aligned to societal demands, confirming that science is partly related to societal needs. However, we find a relevant number of misalignments between the focus of rice research and revealed demands, crucially related to human consumption and nutrition. We discuss some implications for research policy.

AB This paper explores a case of knowledge-intensive consumer services (KICS). Services have become less neglected in the economics of technical change and innovation studies in general; nevertheless, the advance of this agenda has been uneven. A significant emphasis has been on knowledge-intensive business services (KM). Despite their direct impact on social needs and individual desires, innovation in consumer-oriented services continues to be relatively under-theorized and under-researched. This paper brings into focus the sources and patterns of innovation in those innovative services that target human satisfaction and well-being as a final goal. We show evidence from a little-explored health industry, oral care. We address Malo Clinic, a company specialized in the most complex patient situations and a rare instance of an internationalized firm in the health services business. On the basis of a 20-year thread of corporate history, we find that a wide array of qualitative (interviews, newspaper coverage, marketing material) and quantitative evidence (papers, patents, trademarks) illuminates some of the features that may characterize a particular class of dynamic activities tending to consumers' needs, expectations and quality of life. We argue that these key characteristics may be on course to become more general as the learning economy spreads to fully embrace the realm of the service sphere. One conclusion is that both the technological and non-technological capabilities underpinning more types of innovation are increasingly becoming coupled in consumer-relevant services.

AB This paper draws on two case studies from India and China to discuss how and why rapidly urbanizing contexts are particularly challenging for transformative innovation but are also critical sustainability frontiers and learning environments. We argue that lack of understanding and policy engagement with peri-urbanization in its current form is leading to increasing exclusion and unrealized potential to support multiple sustainable urban development goals. Peri-urbanization is often characterized by the neoliberal reordering of space and a co-option of environmental agendas by powerful urban elites. Changing land-use, resource extraction, pollution and livelihood transitions drive rapid changes in interactions between socio-technical and social-ecological systems, and produce complex feedbacks across the rural urban continuum. These contexts also present characteristic governance challenges as a result of jurisdictional ambiguity, transitioning formal and informal institutional arrangements, heterogeneous and sometimes transient communities, shifts in decision making to distant authorities and the rapid growth of informal market-based arrangements with little incentive for environmental management. These unique features of peri-urbanization may reinforce a lack of inclusion and hinder experimentation, but they can also present valuable opportunities for transformative innovation. This innovation is unlikely to follow the lines of niche management and upscaling but rather should take advantage of peri-urban dynamics. There are possibilities to build new alliances in order to renegotiate governance structures across the rural urban continuum, to reframe urban sustainability debates and to reconfigure socio-technical and social ecological systems interactions.

AB This research paper studies the Chinese technological system of production and innovation in the field of photovoltaics (PV). It contributes to a better understanding of the emergence and development of the system by utilizing three levels of analysis: the institutional framework of the system, the market dynamics of production and deployment, and the composition of innovation-related activities. The analysis demonstrates the interrelated roles of transnational factors, local government policies, and research and development (R&D) activities undertaken by the main actors in shaping the system dynamics. Tracking the relative position of China in the global PV manufacturing, installation and technological development, the analysis shows a gap between the growth of China's market share and its modest share of transnational patent applications. This suggests a puzzle, which the paper attempts to answer by inspecting the individual companies in the system against four aspects. First, the dynamic development of their size and performance. Second, the nature of their international involvement through foreign direct investment and mergers and acquisition deals. Third, their technological specialization within the PV value chain over time. Fourth, the spatial scope of their patenting protection endeavours. The analysis recognises four periods of system development driven jointly by market dynamics and government plans. Behind the continuous growth of the system, there were different driving and moderating factors in each period.

AB This paper redefines "frugal innovations", particularly for physical products with relatively complex designs, by using a multidimensional framework that covers design, technological, and economic aspects of innovations, refining and broadening its initial definition as "low-cost innovations" for the unserved lower end of the mass market (ULM). By applying our framework, this paper clarifies and broadens the concept of frugal innovation. The applicability of this broadened concept is demonstrated by using this framework to illustrate two cases of radical frugal innovations in the automobile industry, Tata Motors Nano and Citroen 2CV, from an emerging country and an advanced country respectively.
   The study shows that frugal innovation may improve (rather than decrease) performance of the products deliverable to the ULM under extreme budget constraints by extensive architectural changes and creation of technological knowledge, that integral architectures may be adopted more frequently in frugal radical innovation of relatively complex products such as automobiles, and that such products may not be destructive for producers in the higher price segments.
   The study shows that the existing concepts of frugal innovation that emphasize "low cost/good enough" innovation of "simple products" need to be re-examined, because frugal innovation can also be treated as technological product innovation in the sense that it may improve the performance of relatively complex products deliverable through their architectural changes and creation of technological knowledge. This study shows that there is a domain of innovation policies and strategies activating frugal innovations that calls for integrative and strategic approaches, not only to R&D, but also to other value-adding functions of firms and industries.

AB Transitioning economic sectors towards more sustainable futures is a major global challenge, in particular for non-OECD countries. Policymakers in these countries are confronted with a double challenge: how to implement cleaner technologies and infrastructures while at the same time promoting rapid industrial development. In catch-up studies, this trade-off has been increasingly interpreted as providing windows of opportunity for gaining strong leadership in new generations of cleantech industries. In this paper, we maintain that in order to specify how these windows of opportunity can be endogenized, a deeper understanding is needed about whether, how and by whom the directionality of innovation systems can be influenced. For this purpose, we propose an analytical approach that draws on the technological innovation system framework extending the current understanding of directionality in two ways: first, we complement the prevalent top-down perspective with a bottom-up view exemplified by the institutional entrepreneurship literature. Second, we posit that the focus has to be shifted from the manufacturing of single technologies to the transformation of entire socio-technical systems. The presented framework is validated by a case study on recent shifts in the dominant technology in China's urban water management sector. Major changes in the country's sectoral selection environment led membrane bioreactor technology to become the dominant design in urban water management a development that is unmatched in any other country in the world. Owing to these transformations, China's technology firms outcompete multinational players and therefore they show strong potentials for industrial leapfrogging. However, although the promise to solve environmental problems played a decisive role in the shaping of the selection environment, it remains unclear whether the observed transformation leads the way to a more sustainable sector structure in the longer run. The case, however, still enables us to specify how windows of opportunity can be endogenized through the interplay of different actors trying to shape different layers of the selection environment in a specific sector.

AB The orientation towards grand societal challenges can be seen as a new wave or paradigm for innovation policy. Such policy aims at system-wide transformation and is often referred to as system innovation policy. While insights from transition studies have provided novel and useful rationales for innovation policy targeting system-wide transformation, it remains unclear how to design, implement and evaluate such policies. The contribution of this paper is to translate and concretize the challenges of system innovation policy towards scope for policy action and analysis. Building on insights from transition studies we group the challenges into four domains: directionality, experimentation, demand articulation, and policy coordination and learning. We relate challenges within the four domains to three generic features of innovation systems: interests and capabilities of actors, networks, and institutions. The derived framework is applied in a case study on the strategic innovation programmes, a recent policy initiative by Vinnova, Sweden's Innovation Agency, targeting system innovation.

AB Intermediary actors have been proposed as key catalysts that speed up change towards more sustainable sociotechnical systems. Research on this topic has gradually gained traction since 2009, but has been complicated by the inconsistency regarding what intermediaries are in the context of such transitions and which activities they focus on, or should focus on. We briefly elaborate on the conceptual foundations of the studies of intermediaries in transitions, and how intermediaries have been connected to different transition theories. This shows the divergence and sometimes a lack of conceptual foundations in this research. In terms of transitions theories, many studies connect to the multi-level perspective and strategic niche management, while intermediaries in technological innovation systems and transition management have been much less explored. We aim to bring more clarity to the topic of intermediaries in transitions by providing a definition of transition intermediaries and a typology of five intermediary types that is sensitive to the emergence, neutrality and goals of intermediary actors as well as their context and level of action. Some intermediaries are specifically set up to facilitate transitions, while others grow into the role during the process of socio-technical change. Based on the study, as an important consideration for future innovation governance, we argue that systemic and niche intermediaries are the most crucial forms of intermediary actors in transitions, but they need to be complemented by a full ecology of intermediaries, including regime-based transition intermediaries, process intermediaries and user intermediaries.

AB This paper analyses urban waste systems to explore how local authorities can resolve challenges related to climate change, urbanization and resource depletion. The paper investigates how different public governance regimes affect local authorities' ability to move upwards in the waste hierarchy. It identifies three different governance regimes traditional bureaucracy, new public management and networked governance and uses the insights from innovation in urban waste in three Norwegian city regions Oslo, Drammen and Bergen to illuminate how these regimes possess both strengths and weaknesses in how they affect system optimization and system change. The observed working practices signal that the issue of urban waste systems is perceived as a challenge of system optimization rather than system change. Viewing this as a challenge requiring system change would probably have ensured a stronger directionality and a broader anchoring of actors. Such an approach is likely to have arrived at a waste prevention mode earlier than the step-by-step-solutions implemented so far. The paper concludes that there is not one best governance regime, but a need to acknowledge their coexistence and carefully consider the characteristics of the respective regimes in order to arrange urban waste systems for long-term dynamic and sustainable city regions.

AB Considering high earth abundance and low cost of potassium resource, potassium ion batteries are very promising candidates for energy storage devices due to its similar electrochemical performance to lithium ion batteries and more negative potential than sodium anode. K-Na alloy extending from 41.8 to 90.8 wt% potassium is liquid at ambient temperature. It was used as anode for a rechargeable potassium-sulfur battery in this work because of its high capacity and dendrite-free when charging and discharging. Sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) nanocomposites were synthesized and adopted as cathode in the novel battery within good performance. The novel battery presented better cycling stability than K-SPAN battery.

AB The traditional way to evaluate the wear performance of a material is to conduct wear tests, which has strict requirements on the size and shape of the sample. Besides, the wear process will damage the sample, which is unwanted for the biomaterials. In this work, we performed the nanoindentation test to measure the wear performance through the hardness (H) and reduced elastic modulus (Er) and the results were verified by the wear tests. It is found that the Ti-13Nb-13Zr alloy fabricated with the reasonable energy density has a reduced coefficient of friction of 0.18 and a wear rate of 3.3867 x 10(-4) mm(3)N(-1)M(-1) and has the highest H/Er and H-3/Er-2 ratios. Additionally, the H/Er and H-3/Er-2 ratios of SLM-fabricated Ti-13Nb-13Zr alloy are higher than those of pure titanium, suggesting a better wear resistance. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Iron oxide nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized at room temperature, using a method based on a chemical reaction of iron filings, white vinegar, hydrogen peroxide, and ammonium hydroxide, in the presence of an external magnetic field (EXMF) of 1200 G. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis indicates that magnetite (Fe3O4) is the most predominant phase, with lepidocrocite (gamma-FeO(OH)) in smaller proportion. The shape and average particle size is altered by the application of a magnetic field during NPs synthesis. The average size of crystallite calculated with Scherrer's equation were 30.30 nm without EXMF and 18.37 nm with EXMF. Using electron microscopy techniques (SEM, TEM), NPs with regular shapes were identified when the EXMF was applied. Meanwhile, irregular shapes were observed when the EXMF was not applied. Some NPs with nanoflake shapes and the crystalline phases gamma-FeO(OH) were also identified. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) showed that the NPs with regular shapes are of Fe3O4. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES
AB Atomically perfect graphene is one of the strongest materials ever measured. However, there remains a basic challenge to experimentally determine the inherent tensile strength of graphene nanoribbons, providing a benchmark for design of a variety of graphene-based structures. Using the atomic-scale characterization and in situ high-field tests in a field-ion microscope, it is shown that the inherent strength is 99.34 GPa and represents the intrinsic tensile strength of statistically defect-free graphene nanoribbons. The experimental results were compared with the theoretical data and found to be reliable. Mechanical failure of graphene ribbonss under tensile stress near the ideal strength determines a fundamental upper limit of internal stress in electromechanical graphene devices.

AB Porous CeO2/Au/CeO2 nanorod catalyst has been synthesized by using Ce-MOF as sacrificial template. The preparation involves several sequential steps as follows: 1) synthesis of Ce-MOF, 2) anchoring of Au on Ce-MOF, 3) depositing of tiny CeO2 particles on Ce-MOF/Au through hydrothermal reaction; 4) pyrolysis of Ce-MOF to prepare the inner CeO2 support and obtain grain growth of the outmost CeO2 particles. The TEM and XPS result demonstrated similar chemical properties of CeO2 derived from pyrolysis of Ce-MOF template and growth of tiny CeO2 grains. Moreover, Au nanoparticles can be effectively protected from growth of particle size by the surrounding CeO2 particles. The CeO2/Au/CeO2 catalyst exhibits a remarkable higher catalytic activity in comparison with CeO2/Au counterparts toward reduction of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol by NaBH4 . (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB In2O3 nanosheets with the rhombohedral-cubic phase junction (IONS-RC) were synthesized using graphitic carbon nitride nanosheets as the sacrificial templates. Both of the two-dimensional structure and the phase junction could effectively inhibit the combination of photogenerated charge carriers in IONS-RC, leading to its high activity in photocatalytic degradation of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). This study not only presents an efficient photocatalyst for PFOA degradation, but also propose a novel method to prepare metal oxide nanosheets such as In2O3 nanosheets, Co3O4 nanosheets, and CeO2 nanosheets.

AB Swelling behaviour and morphological characteristics of Arenga pinnata-silicone biocomposite (APSil) after swelling test were investigated and compared to pure silicone rubber (0 wt%). Results indicate that the highest filler addition (16 wt%) possess the lowest swelling rate followed by 8 wt% and 0 wt% specimens. The nature of fibre/matrix interface of the swelled samples was examined through scanning electron microscope. Addition of Arenga pinnata (AP) filler in silicone rubber shows less crack propagation in comparison to without filler. Thus, it can be concluded that the addition of AP filler improves the swelling properties of silicone rubber which makes it a good candidate for sealing application. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The results revealed that at certain temperatures and strain rates the alloy undergoes compression deformation via intragranular deformation. However, with increasing temperatures and decreasing strain rates, this mechanism changed to grain boundary sliding (GBS) of beta/B2 grains and gamma grains in the enlarged shell area and the accommodated intragranular deformation of gamma grains in the core area.

AB Novel Na3Bi(PO4)(2) nanostructures were synthesized for the first time by a facile hydrothermal reaction. Ag2O nanoparticles were deposited on the surface of Na3Bi(PO4)(2) nanostructures by the chemical precipitation method. The photocatalytic performance of the pure Ag2O nanoparticles, Na3Bi(PO4)(2) nanostructures and Ag2O/Na3Bi(PO4)(2) heterogeneous nanostructures were evaluated by photocatalytic decolorization of Rhodamine B (RhB) solution under visible-light irradiation. Compared with the pure Na3Bi(PO4)(2) nanostructures, the Ag2O/Na3Bi(PO4)(2) heterogeneous nanostructures exhibited an obviously enhanced photocatalytic activity. And the photocatalytic stability of the Ag2O/Na3Bi(PO4)(2) heterogeneous nanostructures is much higher than that of the Ag2O nanoparticles. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, bimetallic selenide NiCoSe2 has been successfully synthesized by using metal-organic framework (MOF) precursors. First, Ni-Co-ZIF (nickel and cobalt in the ZIF-67) with the same shape of ZIF-67 was synthesized as a precursor. Next, the NiCoSe2 with polyhedral morphology was produced by annealing the precursor with selenium (Se) powder at high temperature. The NiCoSe2 with a high surface area of 232.8 m(2) g(-1) exhibited a high specific capacitance of 300.2 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1) in 2.0 M KOH electrolyte, and possessed an excellent cycling stability with almost no decrease in capacitance after 2000 cycles at 5 A g(-1). These data suggested that this bimetallic selenide NiCoSe2 with polyhedral morphology could be a promising electrode material for supercapacitors. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A pivotal factor limiting the photocatalytic efficiency of water splitting is the high charge-carrier recombination rate in the photocatalyst. Here, we demonstrate this issue can be relieved by combining photocatalyst with a plasmonic metal. We introduced organic molecule capped silver nanocubes (Ag NCs) to Rh-2 yCryO3/GaN:ZnO (host photocatalyst: GaN:ZnO, hydrogen production cocatalyst: Rh2 yCryO3) and showed that the Ag NCs improved the photocatalytic water splitting efficiency. Finite difference time domain simulations suggested this improvement can be ascribed to efficient photon scattering and intense local electric field by the localized surface plasmon resonance of Ag NCs. The Ag-Rh-2 yCryO3/GaN:ZnO composite exhibited high photochemical stability due to the protection of Ag NCs by the organic surfactant. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The MnO2@P(AN-VDC)/AC composite fibers were prepared using impregnation and coupling method, respectively. MnO2 particles were dispersed uniformly on the surface of coupling composite fiber using PVA as the coupling agent at the concentration of 6 wt%. The MnO2@P(AN-VDC)/AC composite fibers which was fabricated by coupling method offered better adsorption property towards formaldehyde than that via impregnation procedure. Meanwhile, activated carbon (AC) was also beneficial for the HCHO adsorption. As the increasing of content of activated carbon, the HCHO adsorption amount was enhanced. With the high adsorption efficiency of the P(AN-VDC)/AC fibers and the adsorption affinity of MnO2, the fabricated MnO2@P(AN-VDC)/AC composite fibers provided a way for the removing of the harmful VOC formaldehyde.

AB A novel Cu-based Cu54Zr22Ti18Ni6 bulk metallic glass (BMG) powder was successfully joined to Cu powder via spark plasma sintering at 440 degrees C under a compressive stress of 80 MPa for 4 min. No crystallization and visible defects were observed in the sinter-joined sample with a relative density of 99.7%. The temperature of the supercooled-liquid region (Delta T-x) and the crystallization enthalpy (Delta H) were measured after sinter-joining, and were found to decrease with increasing processing temperature from 400 degrees C to 480 degrees C. Meanwhile, the thermal stability of the BMG slightly decreased with increasing processing temperature. The X-ray diffraction pattern exhibited no crystal peaks except for a diffuse halo at similar to 42 degrees under all conditions except 480 degrees C. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The effects of the annealing temperature on structural, optical and electrical characteristics were investigated. All the annealed CMTS thin films show Cu-poor and slightly S-poor condition. X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results reveal the formation of zinc-blende structure CMTS thin films. The increase of sulfurization temperature improves the crystallinity and diminishes the bandgaps of CMTS films.

AB Rose flower shaped cobalt ferrite has been synthesized by a facile and template-free hydrothermal method. The advantages of CoFe2O4 for fabricating efficient photovoltaic devices are investigated in this work. As-synthesized material was investigated by X-ray diffraction, field-emission scanning electron microscope which revealed the formation of rose shaped single phase CoFe2O4. Dielectric study in the frequency range from 100 Hz to 1 mHz revealed an increase in dielectric constant along with a decrease in dielectric loss under illumination (lambda >= 390 nm). Achievement of such high dielectric constant as well as low dielectric loss simultaneously in a particular material is very rare. It was found that CoFe2O4 exhibited obvious photocurrent responses under illumination. The electrical properties were further analysed by current-voltage (I-V) measurements under dark and illuminated condition and with increasing temperature. As a result a temperature dependence of the current-voltage characteristics was obtained. These results indicate that the CoFe2O4 possess significant photovoltaic properties and the electrical properties vary under illumination. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Microporous electrospun PVDF-HFP nonwoven separators have advantages of higher porosities and better wettabilities compared with conventional polyolefin, but suffer from low mechanical strength and excessive swelling in electrolyte. To enhance the mechanical properties, thermal and dimensional stabilities as well as electrochemical performance of electrospun separators, cross-linked membranes covalently integrated with hybrid silsesquioxane components were fabricated by in-situ crosslinking method, obtaining armor-like shell structure coated on PVDF-HFP fibers. The silsesquioxanes crosslinked PVDF-HFP fibers separator (SQ-PFF) exhibits excellent tensile and puncture strength, superior thermal and dimensional stabilities. Besides, the SQ-PFF prepared cells revealed remarkable discharge capacity and excellent cycling performance ascribing to the high lithium-ion conductivity and the enhanced cross-linked structure.

AB Cubic boron nitride (c-BN) single crystals were synthesized in Li3N-BN system. The variation of sp(2):sp(3) ratio from boron K-edges in different interfacial layers covering on as-grown c-BN single crystals was investigated by electron energy loss spectroscopy. The sp(3) fractions from the outer to the inner layers exhibit an increasing trend, correspondingly, the sp(2) fractions decrease gradually. The fractions of sp(3)-bonded BN from the outer to the inner are 10.36%, 11.55%, and 16.67%, respectively. The main phases in the synthesized interfacial powders are confined as c-BN, h-BN microcrystals. On the basis of our findings, it is concluded that c-BN could be transformed from h-BN directly and the catalysis of Li3BN2 was analyzed briefly. (C) 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Recently, porous metal oxides derived from MOF (metal-organic framework) has been reported to have outstanding gas sensing performance. However, how and why the structures derived from MOF promote the properties need a further research. Herein, porous Co3O4 was synthesized by calcining Prussian blue analogue (PBA, a typical MOF material) cubes. As-prepared Co3O4 has a porous cubic structure and shows a high response to n-butanol. By comparing with the smashed sample, it is found that the hierarchical structure of initial Co3O4 derived from PBA templates contributes to the enhanced gas sensing performance. It is because that the special porous structure is beneficial for the diffusion of n-butanol deep inside the sensing layer. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A 0.31 mm-diameter Mg97Y2Zn1 alloy wire with high yield strength of 550 MPa, ultimate tensile strength of 570 MPa and elongation of 12% was successfully prepared via the combination of ECAP and heavy drawing at elevated temperatures. Microstructure observation showed that the 18R phases were broken into fine particles and formed clusters during drawing of ECAP rod. The alpha-Mg matrix was refined via dynamic recrystallization, and the DRX grains were mixed with dynamically precipitated 14H particles. The ultra-fined microstructure, as well as the homogenous distribution of LPSO particles and clusters, contributed to the exceptional mechanical properties of Mg97Y2Zn1 alloy wire.

AB A complex structure consisting of ultrafine-grained processed zone and coarse-grained base material zone was developed in this study, aiming at improving the yield strength of a high nitrogen stainless steel without sacrificing corrosion resistance and ductility. The ultrafine-grained processed zone was produced by friction stir processing, leading to ultra-high strength and great pitting corrosion resistance, but significantly reduced ductility; the coarse-grained zone exhibited excellent ductility but a very low yield strength. The enhancement and coordination between the processed zone and coarse-grained zone resulted in significantly improved yield strength and ductility of the complex structure. Thus, a combination of excellent mechanical properties and corrosion resistance was successfully achieved. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Unconventional exchange bias (EB) has been observed in epitaxially grown manganite bilayers composed of ferromagnetic LaMnO3 and G-type antiferromagnetic SrMnO3, with the Curie temperature T-C of LaMnO3 lower than the Neel temperature T-N of SrMnO3. A maximum EB field of 254 Oe at 2 K is achieved and the unconventional EB appears below a blocking temperature of about 150 K, very close to the T-C of the LaMnO3 layer. Such an effect is believed to arise from an interfacial cluster-glass-like state due to the spin frustration at the interface in the LaMnO3/SrMnO3 bilayer. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Green synthesis of magnetic iron-doped ZnO nanoparticles (Fe-ZnO) was prepared using Hibiscus rosa-sinensis leaf extracts. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy results confirmed the presence of phyto-chemicals in leaf extracts on the formation of nanoparticles. The ferromagnetic behaviour was witnessed by magnetization study. The average particle sizes calculated from field emission scanning electron microscopy analysis was in the range of 15-170 nm. It was then tested for photodegradation of palm oil mill effluent and antimicrobial activities towards Escherichia coli and Candida albicans. Fe-ZnO demonstrated excellent photocatalytic, antibacterial and antifungal activities as compared to those of pure ZnO and commercial ZnO. The apparent photoactivity of the Fe-ZnO can be accounted from the abundance of hydroxyl group, small particle size and appropriate band energy of the nanoparticles. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Control of the wall thicknesses of supramolecular organic nanotubes is important in terms of the hierarchy, dispersibility, and surface areas. We have succeeded in the selective preparation of single-walled asymmetrical nanotube by the coordination/dissociation of Pt(II) complexes with a carboxylic-bearing bolaamphiphile. Conventional pH-adjustment of the bolaamphiphile yields multiple-walled nanotube. Interestingly, the coordination of cisplatin or transplatin with the bolaamphiphile demonstrate a cistrans effect in intermediate assemblies, removal of the Pt(II) yields the same single-walled asymmetrical nanotubes. Further, the endo-coordinated cisplatin-nanotube can serve as a soft template for platinum nanoparticles. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB TiAl intermetallic compounds were deposited using in-situ alloying with the dual-wire arc additive manufacturing method, and their material properties were investigated. The compounds were designed with different phase constituents and microstructure, achieved through adjusting the elemental wire feed rates according to atomic ratios of Ti: Al = 65%: 35%, 55%: 45%, and 45%: 55%, respectively. Single alpha(2)-Ti3Al and gamma-TiAl phases were obtained with compositions of Ti-35%Al and Ti-55%Al, while Ti-45%Al resulted in the phase composed of gamma-TiAl and alpha(2)-Ti3Al. Additionally, the influence of phase composition and microstructure on mechanical properties and oxidation behaviour of the fabricated materials were studied and analysed. In conclusion, the phase composition of TiAl intermetallic alloys could be readily controlled using the dual-wire WAAM method and acceptable properties could be obtained. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

ID BEHAVIOR
AB Fatigue cracks evaluation is mainly based on qualitative evaluation, and quantitative evaluation is still in the primary stage. In quantitative evaluation investigations thermal fatigue damage factor, D, expressed in terms of the percentage of surface crack area (S) and the average width of surface main crack (Ws), are difficult to calculate accurately. Therefore, combining scanning electron microscope images and Photoshop software, we calculate the conversion rate between the pixels and the actual length of scale, then, cracks parameters are expressed in pixels. Eventually, the thermal fatigue damage factor can be represented by pixels, and an accurate thermal fatigue damage factor was calculated. Fatigue cracks can be comprehensively and quantitatively evaluated. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A Cu-10 vol% Y2O3 nanocomposite was successfully fabricated via a novel route, namely a multi-step ball milling and reduction process, using CuO and Y2O3 as raw materials. The copper matrix nanocomposite exhibited a high microhardness of HV209.6 (three times that of pure copper), high compressive 0.2% strength of 655 MPa (seven times that of pure copper), favourable ductility of 33.4% and good electrical conductivity of 53.8% IACS. The changes in phases and microstructure after different process steps were investigated. The result revealed that CuO particles were reduced nearly completely after the 2nd reduction process, and the crystallite size of copper remained in the nanoscale after the consolidation process. Furthermore, 10 vol% yttria nanoparticles were uniformly dispersed in the nanocrystalline copper matrix composite. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID NANOINDENTATION; ALLOY
AB Typical lamellar and equiaxed microstructure of matrix in SiC fiber reinforced Ti17 alloy composites (SiCf/Ti17 composites) can be obtained through matrix composition tuning. The discrepancy of microstructure characteristic results in lower hardness but superior deformation resistance (lower strain-rate sensitivity exponent) in lamellar structure than equiaxed structure. The further microstructure analysis on indent impressions indicates the micro-scale deformation mechanism of lamellar microstructure is principally dominated by dislocation movement in each layer along phase interfaces, rather than in the normal direction due to existence of the large amount of phase interfaces. In contrast, higher hardness comes from dislocation pinning in uniform-distribution grain boundaries in equiaxed microstructure, while quasi-isotropy character makes it more strain-rate sensitivity than lamellar structure.

AB A novel strategy has been developed to modify boron nitride nanosheets (BNNSs) with polycationic electrolytes through surface-initiated, activators regenerated by electron transfer atom transfer radical polymerization (ARGET ATRP). Surface-modification of BNNSs was realized in two steps, by first anchoring alpha-bromoisobutyryl bromide (BiBB) through esterification and subsequently by initiating 2-(methacry loyloxy)ethyltrimethylammonium chloride (DMC) through ARGET ATRP to produce surface-modified BNNSs (BNNSs/PDMC). The BNNSs/PDMC exhibited excellent water dispersibility, and they improve the mechanical properties of carboxymethyl cellulose films significantly, enabling Young's modulus to be increased by 729%.

AB We elucidate three distinguished microstructural features and their contribution to the overall properties and strengthening in a Fe-11Mn-10Al-1.25C alloy treated at various temperatures. At 1000 degrees C, the nano-scaled ordered kappa-carbides in the austenitic matrix contributed to YS (1041 MPa) without scarifying ductility (similar to 30%). At 900 degrees C, the significantly refined triplex microstructure with GB kappa-carbides caused similar YS but limited ductility (similar to 8%). At 800 degrees C, a jump of YS but almost no ductility resulted from the synergic effects of the hard ferrite and lamellar microstructure. The microstructure-dependent mechanical responses were further clarified by analyses of flow curves and fractographs. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this letter, we demonstrate that the replacement of Ho with Nd in Tb0.15Ho0.85-xNdxFe2 system not only reduces the cost of the material, but also improves the magnetostrictive properties effectively. Tb0.15Ho0.65Nd0.2Fe2 exhibits a large low-field magnetostriction, which is 50% higher than that of Nd-free compound. The spin reorientation temperature of the system was raised with the introduction of Nd. Meanwhile, the easy magnetization direction of Tb0.15Ho0.65Nd0.2Fe2 is along < 111 > axis at room temperature, leading to a rhombohedral symmetry in this compound. This work indicates that Nd can be considered as a low-cost alternative element for the heavy rare earth Ho. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Cocoon-like Ag3PO4 (C-Ag3PO4) with hollow structure was synthesized via ion-exchange route using Ag2MoO4 and Na2HPO4 as precursors. Photocatalytic degradation experiments of the C-Ag3PO4 toward ciprofloxacin (CIP) were investigated under visible light irradiation. The C-Ag3PO4 showed superior photodegradation of CIP owing to its larger surface area and hollow structure. Besides, the C-Ag3PO4 exhibited improved photocatalytic performance and good stability after repeating cycles, which could be attributed to the formed metal silver under visible light irradiation. Moreover, radical trap experiment was carried out, which indicated that the photo-induced holes (h(+)) and superoxide radicals (center dot O-2) acted as the main reactive species in the photodegradation process.

AB Silver sulfide quantum dots have shown large potential in applications such as photocatalysts, solar cells and sensors due to their excellent photovoltaic performances, chemical stability and low toxicity. In this work, size-controlled silver sulfide quantum dots were successfully prepared by a water/AOT/isooctane reverse microemulsion system, in which hydrophilic silver ions were successfully dispersed in oil phase (isooctane) serving as silver source and the sodium sulfide solution were wrapped in aqueous droplets serving as the "nano reactor". The results indicate that monoclinic silver sulfide quantum dots with the controlled size from 3 to 8 nm can be synthesized by fine tuning the content of silver ion and reaction time, while the products show broad absorption spectrum from NIR to UV-vis region and intensive NIR fluorescence around 1140 nm wavelength. Further, a possible crystal formation mechanism of silver sulfide quantum dots was proposed. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Compared with its coarse-grained samples, nano-grained CR sheets exhibited a weakened wear-resistance under dry conditions. It is attributed to the increase of grain boundaries exacerbating oxidative wear process. Polyalphaolefin (PAO4) can effectively improve the wear-resistance and friction-reduction of nano-grained CR samples. The revelation on the evolution of tribological mechanisms from severe oxidative to mild adhesive wear was beneficial for its industrial application with the anti-wear design. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB A novel active screen (AS) plasma process is developed for the in situ growth of one-dimensional Ag wires and the deposition of reinforced composite coating thereof. Silver wires embedded in the matrix were deposited with Ag nanoparticles, stainless steel nanoparticles and carbon during the AS plasma sputtering process in the ambient of methane and hydrogen. This provided a relatively low-temperature processing route for one-step synthesis of abrasion resistant coating on metallic substrate. Microstructure evolution during sliding with ductile materials proven the ultra-low friction deriving from the molecular ordering of carbon and the high-strength structural holding by the Ag wires.

AB Lattice phosphorus (P) doping has been demonstrated as an effective method for tuning the fluorescence of graphene quantum dots (GQDs). Due to the many possible oxidation states of P, lattice P-doped GQDs (P-GQDs) are still difficult to synthesize. Here, we report the green preparation of P-GQDs via solvothermal treatment of lecithin with high yield (71 wt%). The resulting P-GQDs show controllable emission wavelength (457-632 nm) and high quantum yield (0.54-0.73), and have demonstrated potential for applications in fluorescent bio-imaging.

ID GROWTH
AB Metastable CaAl2Si2O8 crystalline phase was obtained via heat treatment of CaO-Al2O3-SiO2 glass with metallic molybdenum particles as nucleating agents. Its crystal structure was determined by aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (Cs-STEM), Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Although the hexagonal structure was observed by Cs-STEM and Raman spectroscopy, Rietveld analysis revealed that a triclinic structure with space group P1 provided the best description of the crystal structure. The most appropriate lattice parameters were a = 5 .1163(5) angstrom, b = 5.1155(5) angstrom, c = 15.0031(15) angstrom, alpha = 91.319(3)degrees, beta= 88.172(3)degrees, and gamma = 120.279(3)degrees. The c-axis layers composing the hexagonal plane were slightly distorted a few degrees from their arrangement in the hexagonal CaAl2Si2O8 crystal. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB A novel porous AgBr microstructure with an average diameter of 1-4 mu m was prepared for the first time through a facile two-step method, including the formation of AgBr/AgCl alloyed materials and the subsequent removal of AgCl. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) were utilized to characterize the morphology, phase structure and elemental composition of the as-prepared products, respectively. The photocatalytic activity of the as-prepared products was investigated by the degradation of rhodamine B (RhB) under visible-light irradiation. The porous AgBr microstructure significantly enhanced the photocatalytic activity compared with AgCl and AgBr/AgCl alloys. The porous AgBr photocatalyst has potential application on pollutant degradation under sunlight. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Cheap metals, such as Cu, can not catalyze aerobic oxidative polymerization of anilines because of insufficient electric potential differences between their high and low valent ions. Therefore, conventionally, preparation of cheap metal nanoparticles supported on polyanilines (nano M@PANIs) inevitablly requires chemical oxidants such as (NH4)(2)S2O8 that generate solid wastes. In this work, we found that, by using H2O2 as the green oxidant, nano Cu@PANI could be easily prepared without solid waste generation. In the material, copper nanoparticles highly dispersed on the waxberry-like nano PANI support and possessed overwhelmingly better catalytic activities in C-N coupling reactions than Cu@PANIs prepared via (NH4)(2)S2O8 oxidation method. This should be the first example for the synthesis of cheap metal nanoparticles on PANI via an environment-friendly method and might be a breakthrough in the field of nano M@PANIs investigation to expand the application scopes of these materials for low cost and green features.

AB Potassium-doped titania (K-doped TiO2) films had been prepared by molten-salt treatment in KNO3 for Ti-TiC coatings, containing different amount of TiC, in order to achieve enhanced activity of the films. When the amount of TiC is lower than 40%, the partial surface morphology of K-doped TiO2 films clearly shows a nanosheet structure, and the formed nanosheets could increase the accessible surface area. The results show that K-doped TiO2 with composite crystals has formed with different amount of TiC, and the relative Raman peak intensity of Ti-O-K bonding is highest for 40% TiC. Even avoiding high adsorption of K-doped TiO2 films, the films exhibit excellent and stable photocatalytic activity. With increasing the amount of TiC, the photocatalytic activity of K-doped TiO2 films first increases then decreases, reaching the highest for 40% TiC. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A new strategy is demonstrated to fabricate colorful colloidal photonic crystal fibers (CPCFs) by microfluidic spinning technique. We employed a homogeneous mixture of viscous polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and monodisperse SiO2 particles to fabricate micro-scale fibers. By manipulating the motor speed of the microfluidic spinning machine, various diameter fibers were produced efficiently. Monodisperse SiO2 particles can assemble into photonic crystal structures by removing PVP through calcination and show bright structural colors, which can be easily adjusted by changing the sizes of SiO2 colloids. In addition, we successfully fabricated humidity-sensitive polyacrylamide (PAM)/CPCFs, which exhibited obvious color response to the environmental humidity. The chromatic transitions span over almost the whole visible spectrum. This work might promote the development of colorful colloidal photonic crystal fibers via a microfluidic spinning technique.

AB In this study, individually free-standing piezoelectric nanotubes-based magnetoelectric thin films were synthesized by complexation of one-dimensional (1D) BaTiO3 as the piezoelectric phase, and CoFe2O4 as the magnetostrictive phase. Particularly, the individually TiO2 free-standing nanotubes were developed onto a Ti substrate via metal anodizing to obtain a high standing stability of 1D piezoelectric structure and a filling volume of magnetostrictive phase, simultaneously for fabrication of magnetoelectric thin films. After BaTiO3 perovskite conversion from the TiO2 nanotubes, an enough volume still remains for sufficient self-filling of CoFe2O4 between the BaTiO3 nanotubes. Finally, BaTiO3/CoFe2O4 magnetoelectric films were found to exhibit a dense structure being suitable for strong magnetostriction-mediated piezoelectric voltages. The structure design, based on individually free-standing nanotubes, would be feasible for flexible magnetoelectric devices such as health monitoring sensors, energy harvesters, and memory devices.

AB The search of new efficient antibacterial agents for biomedical applications is subject of researchers special attention. Bimetallic nanoparticles containing biologically active metals are prospective antibacterial agents. The "Janusp"-like Cu/Fe nanoparticles prepared by electrical explosive of wires were found to exhibit high antibacterial activity comparable with that of Ag nanoparticles and exceed the antibacterial activity of Fe and Cu monometallic nanoparticles and their mixture. MIC values of bimetallic Cu/Fe particles are 3.91-250 mu g/ml. This strong antibacterial activity is due to the synergistic bactericidal Cu(2+)and Fe3+ ions released from Cu/Fe bimetallic nanoparticles. Cu/Fe nanoparticles are a promising material for antibacterial protection technologies and for fighting drug-resistant bacterial strains. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The crystal size and surface coverage of a perovskite layer at its interface with 2,2',7,7'-tetrakis-(N,N-di-4-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9'-spirobifluorene (sprio-MeOTAD) have been controlled by crystallization temperature (25, 40, 60 and 75 degrees C) during the conversion of PbI2 to MAPbI(3). The high crystallization temperature induces to form large crystals and vice versa. The highest efficiency (13.9%) was observed with the perovskite layer fabricated under 25 degrees C among four different temperature conditions. This is mostly because of the suppressed recombination through the formation of a rather compact layer with the small sized perovskite crystals, even though its reduced light absorption and electron conductivity to a small extent. The performance has been characterized by photovoltaic parameters with help of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to confirm that the charge recombination is a main parameter in controlling power conversion efficiency (PCE).

AB Tb0.94Pr0.06VO4(TPV) magneto-optical crystal with sizes of 27 x 35 mm(3) was grown by the Czochralski (Cz) method. Its structure was verified by Powder X-ray diffraction, demonstrating that TPV belongs to tetragonal system. The optical and magneto-optical properties were systematically investigated. TPV exhibits high transparency in the near-infrared region. The Verdet constants of TPV at 633 and 1064 nm are about 60% larger than that of TGG. The thermal conductivity and laser-induced damage threshold of TPV were also determined for evaluating its practical usage. All the results indicate that TPV is a promising Faraday rotation material for magneto-optical applications in high power laser systems. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Novel microwave absorber of Fe@ZrO2 nanocapsules chains has been fabricated by the one-step process of arc discharge plasma. The Fe@ZrO2 nanochains exhibit a saturation magnetization (M-s) of 188 emu/g and a coercivity of 253 Oe. It is found that the high dielectric ZrO2 shell (epsilon(r) approximate to 14 in bulk) has less interference on intrinsic magnetism of the Fe core, which favors to build up a strong magnetic/dielectric coupling within the core@shell type Fe@ZrO2 nanocapsules. The Fe@ZrO2 nanochains are stable up to similar to 437 degrees C in the air, implying its higher anti-oxidization ability in a severe environment. The minimum reflection loss (RL) value of Fe@ZrO2 nanochains reaches to -45.36 dB in a thickness of 3 mm, and the frequency band covers 10.0-18.0 GHz with RLs less than -10 dB in a thickness of 1.5 mm. The excellent microwave absorption ability is attributed to the high magnetic/dielectric losses from multi-resonances and interfacial polarization, as well a proper matching between electromagnetic phases. This work may provide inspiration and insight into the combination of highly stable ceramics and metallic components within an encapsulated nanostructure. Also, it would be an effective route for designing and exploiting novel high-temperature microwave absorbers. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   FRAMEWORK
AB Due to the increasing awareness of environmental and social issues, sustainable supplier selection becomes an important problem. The aim of this paper is to develop a novel group decision making sustainable supplier selection approach using extended Techniques for Order Preferences by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) under interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy environment. Sustainable supplier selection often involves uncertain information due to the subjective nature of human judgments, and the interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy set (IVPFS) has great ability to address strong fuzziness, ambiguity and inexactness during the decision-making process. The first contribution of this research is to use the IVPFS to capture the uncertain information of decision makers. Moreover, sustainable supplier selection often involves multiple decision makers from different groups. The second contribution of this research is to develop a group decision making approach for sustainable supplier selection. TOPSIS is the most commonly used technique in sustainable supplier selection. The third contribution of this research is to propose an extended TOPSIS method by integrating distance and similarity between alternatives concurrently to evaluate performances of suppliers. In this research, the group decision making approach and extended TOPSIS method is also extended to IVPFSs. Finally, experiments are conducted to verify the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed sustainable supplier selection approach. Experiments results show that the proposed approach is effective and efficient to help decision makers to select optimal sustainable suppliers. Therefore, the proposed approach can be applied by managers to evaluate and determine appropriate suppliers in sustainable supplier selection process. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this article, we introduced a novel algorithm to identify and correct images affected by impulse noise. The proposed technique composed of two stages: noisy pixels identification and restoration of them. Here, empirical mode decomposition is used to identify the pixels affected by impulse noise and adaptive bilateral filter is used to restore those noisy pixels. Mean absolute difference of the intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) are compared with the two dimensional cross entropic threshold value in order to identify the pixels affected by the impulse noise. In the next stage of the processing, an adaptive bilateral filter is used to retain the fine details and remove the noisy components in the image. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated on different benchmark images. Four performance evaluation measures: Peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), Image Enhancement Factor (IEF), Mean Structure Similarity Index (MSSIM) and Correlation Factor (CF) are used to test the performance of the proposed algorithm. The simulation results of the proposed algorithm claim better result than the other existing state-of-the-art algorithms. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Industrial Robots are utilized to perform complicated and hazardous tasks accurately and also used to enhance the quality and efficiency of the work. Selecting an industrial robot for performing a particular task depends on the work and the associated criteria of the robot. The materials handled by the robots are different like powdered, adhesive, bulky, brittle etc. In this manner, choosing a suitable robot from the set of available industrial robots to handle a particular material is a challenging task. To get a more conscionable decision result, a decision organization contains a lot of decision makers. The interval- valued intuitionistic hesitant fuzzy set is utilized as a competent mathematical tool for enunciate individuals hesitant thinking. An interval- valued intuitionistic hesitant fuzzy set (IVIHFS) concedes a set of several possible interval- valued intuitionistic fuzzy membership and non- membership values. Finally, the proposed interval- valued intuitionistic hesitant fuzzy entropy and VIKOR techniques utilized for industrial robot selection. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, a novel autonomous tracking control (ATC) of intelligent electric vehicles (IEVs) based on lane detection and sliding-mode control (SMC) is innovatively developed to implement accurate path tracking and optimal torque distribution between the motors of IEVs. Initially, the road image was captured by the camera and was processed to extract the lane markings and to calculate the desired steering angle by the lateral trajectory tracking error and the head tracking error. Then, to accurately track the desired path, an optimal preview linear quadratic regulator (OP_LQR) based on SMC approach with 2-DOF vehicle model was proposed. To prove the effectiveness of the proposed OP_LQR scheme, the marking recognition analysis and the optimization results of the traditional three controllers are obtained and compared. Results show that the lane marking identification algorithm has high accuracy. Moreover, the actual path with the proposed method can better track the desired trajectory and appropriate differential braking torques are allocated into four wheels. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Summarization, is to reduce the size of the document while preserving the meaning, is one of the most researched areas among the Natural Language Processing (NLP) community. Summarization techniques, on the basis of whether the exact sentences are considered as they appear in the original text or new sentences are generated using natural language processing techniques, are categorized into extractive and abstractive techniques. Extractive summarization has been a very extensively researched topic and has reached to its maturity stage. Now the research has shifted towards the abstractive summarization. The complexities underlying with the natural language text makes abstractive summarization a difficult and a challenging task.
   This paper presents a comprehensive review of the various works performed in abstractive summarization field. For this purpose, we have selected the recent papers on this topic from Elsevier, ACM, IEEE, Springer, ACL Anthology, Cornell University Library and Google Scholar. The papers are categorized according to the type of abstractive technique used. The paper lists down the various challenges and discusses the future direction for research in this field. Along with these, we have identified the advantages and disadvantages of various methods used for abstractive summarization. We have also listed down the various tools which have been used or developed by researchers for abstractive summarization. The paper also discusses the evaluation techniques being used for assessing the abstractive summaries. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Over the centuries, languages have evolved and influenced each other. These changes might have been caused by long wars, economic superiority, religious imposition or scientific domination. These macro-level forces at micro-level deeply involve individuals who want to translate their messages into another language. Therefore, the frequency of translation requests from a language to another might be an acceptable measure to show the necessity of those languages to each other given speakers of those languages are unable to communicate due to linguistic barriers. In this paper, we first collect the average number of translation requests per month from the Google search engine for one hundred languages and then visualize them by using customized presentation software to identify features and patterns. Based on the extracted information, the rank and the position of each language in the global language network have been investigated with respect to four criteria: translation balance, centrality, the number of connections and native speaker population, and interconnections between language families. Our study sheds light on the individual's consumption behavior of machine translation in different cultures. Our findings might be interesting especially for policymakers who design school curricula.

AB Automatic and accurate breast ultrasound (BUS) image segmentation is crucial to achieve effective ultrasound-based computer aided diagnosis (CAD) systems for breast cancer. However, segmenting the tumor in BUS images is often challenging due to several artifacts that degrade the quality of ultrasound images. In this study, a new two-phase method is proposed to enable automatic and accurate segmentation of BUS images by decomposing the image into superpixels with high boundary recall ratio and employing edge- and region-based information to outline the tumor. The first phase of the method obtains an initial outline of the tumor by decomposing the BUS image into coarse superpixels to enable effective estimation of their tumor likelihoods and employing a customized graph cuts algorithm to segment the superpixels. The segmentation of the superpixels is carried out using edge-based information that quantifies the image contour cue and region-based information that characterizes the texture content of the superpixels. In the second phase, the tumor outline is improved by decomposing the BUS image into fine superpixels that enable high boundary recall ratio and employing the customized graph cuts algorithm to segment the superpixel located around the initial tumor outline. Furthermore, an edge-based active contour model is used to smooth the tumor outline. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated using a database that includes 160 BUS images (86 benign and 74 malignant). The results indicate that the first phase of the proposed method was able to detect the tumor in all BUS images and obtain mean values of the true positive ratio (TPR), false positive ratio (FPR), false negative ratio (FNR), similarity ratio (SIR), Hausdorff error (HE), and mean absolute error (ME) equal to 91.68, 11.16, 8.32, 84.52, 17.59, and 4.67, respectively. In fact, the results obtained by the first phase of the proposed method outperform four existing BUS image segmentation algorithms. Moreover, the second phase of the proposed method was able to improve the tumor outlines of the first phase and achieve mean TPR, FPR, FNR, SIR, HE, and ME values of 96.04, 7.99, 3.96, 91.41, 11.66, and 3.65, respectively. These results suggest the feasibility of employing the proposed method, which enables automatic and accurate tumor segmentation in BUS images, to develop effective CAD systems for breast cancer.

AB Due to the rapid increase of different digitised documents, there has been significant attention dedicated to document image retrieval over the past two decades. Finding discriminative and effective features is a fundamental task for providing a fast and more accurate retrieval system. Texture features are generally fast to compute and are suitable for large volume data. Thus, in this study, the effectiveness of texture features widely used in the literature of content-based image retrieval is investigated on document images. Twenty-six different texture feature extraction methods from four main categories of texture features, statistical, transform, model, and structural-based approaches, are considered in this research work to compare their performance on the problem of document image retrieval. Three document image datasets, MTDB, ITESOFT, and CLEF_IP with various content and page layouts are used to evaluate the twenty-six texture-based features on document image retrieval systems. The retrieval results are computed in terms of precision, recall and F-score, and a comparative analysis of the results is also provided. Feature dimensions and time complexity of the texture-based feature methods are further compared. Finally, some conclusions are drawn and suggestions are made about future research directions.

AB Evolutionary Computation (EC) algorithms have been proposed as stochastic methods to solve complex optimization problems. The design of EC methods typically involves the construction of empirical operators based on abstractions of animal behaviors or physical and biological phenomena. Through its operators, every EC approach proposes a particular solution to the exploration-exploitation balance which is currently considered an unsolved problem within EC literature. On the other hand, multi-agent systems have been utilized as intelligent, cooperative and self-organized structures where the synergy of simple rules creates complex interactions among agents. In this paper, a novel EC algorithm called Neighborhood-based Consensus for Continuous Optimization (NCCO) is presented. NCCO is based on typical processes present in multi-agent systems, such as local consensus formulations and reactive responses. These operations are conducted by using appropriate operators that are applied in each evolutionary stage. A traditional EC algorithm considers in its operation the application of every operator without examining its final impact in the searching process. In contrast to other EC techniques, the proposed method uses additional operators to avoid the undesirable effects produced by the over-exploitation or suboptimal exploration of conventional operations. In order to illustrate the performance and accuracy of the proposed NCCO approach, it is compared to several well-known, state-of-the-art algorithms over a set of benchmark functions and real-world design applications. The experimental results demonstrate that NCCO's performance is superior to the test algorithms. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Measuring toxicity is an important step in drug development. However, the current experimental methods which are used to estimate the drug toxicity are expensive and need high computational efforts. Therefore, these methods are not suitable for large-scale evaluation of drug toxicity. As a consequence, there is a high demand to implement computational models that can predict drug toxicity risks. In this paper, we used a dataset that consists of 553 drugs that biotransformed in the liver. In this data, there are four toxic effects, namely, mutagenic, tumorigenic, irritant and reproductive effects. Each drug is represented by 31 chemical descriptors. This paper proposes two models for predicting drug toxicity risks. The proposed models consist of three phases. In the first phase, the most discriminative features are selected using rough set-based methods to reduce the classification time and improve the classification performance. In the second phase, three different sampling algorithms, namely, Random Under-Sampling, Random Over-Sampling, and Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) are used to obtain balanced data. In the third phase, the first proposed model employs the Neutrosophic Rule-based Classification System (NRCS), and the second model uses Genetic NRCS (GNRCS) to classify an unknown drug into toxic or non-toxic. The experimental results proved that the proposed models obtained high sensitivity (89-93%), specificity (91-97%), and GM (90-94%) for all toxic effects. Overall, the results of the proposed models indicate that it could be utilized for the prediction of drug toxicity in the early stages of drug development. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The segmentation of unconstrained handwriting is an important issue for both recognition and synthesis systems. In this direction, hidden Markov model (HMM) has been the most popular method for segmentation of continuous handwriting. It has been employed in both implicit and explicit segmentation-based recognition systems. The main advantage of HMM-based force alignment method is that it can segment the handwriting to basic units (e.g. characters) without any knowledge of ground truth boundaries. However, the alignment acquired from an HMM framework often fails to segment the basic units to their actual boundaries. This paper analyzes the segmentation errors made by the HMM in details and identifies an early character boundary problem. Accordingly, an automatic boundary correction method is proposed which utilizes both the forward and the reverse direction alignments of handwritten data with its transcription. This improves the alignment of data and thus the character boundaries in cursive handwriting. The proposed method enhances the word recognition performance for both the Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-HMM and deep neural network (DNN)-HMM frameworks compared to the conventional approach, when evaluated on UNIPEN ICROW-03 and IAM-onDB databases.

AB Construction is a knowledge-intensive industry, in which organizations are known for the delivery of products and services, relying on different types of knowledge. To manage knowledge effectively, various information technology (IT) models and systems have been developed for knowledge management (KM) in the construction industry over the years. As the next generation of IT application in construction, building information modeling (BIM) is increasingly used today to aid KM. Compared to generic IT tools, BIM has some distinctive features, such as parametric modeling, virtual visualization and centralized platform. However, how to apply these features of BIM to better serve KM has not yet been well summarized and analyzed. In this research, 115 papers on IT-based KM and 73 papers on BIM-supported KM are reviewed, based on which an integrated framework is developed to describe the current status and future directions for KM in IT-generic and BIM-specific contexts. It is followed by a conceptual model of BIM-supported KM which shows the possible KM factors and their relationships in the BIM environment. This research highlights the transformation from IT-based KM into BIM-supported KM. It contributes to the identification of remaining challenges to BIM-supported KM and the elaboration of BIM-supported KM in construction research and practice. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Sleep stage classification is a most important process in sleep scoring which is used to evaluate sleep quality and diagnose sleep-related diseases. Compared to complex sleep analysis devices, automatic sleep stage classification methods using single-channel electroencephalography (EEG) records benefit from the convenience of wearing and less interference in the sleep, thus are appropriate for home-based sleep analysis. In these methods, the design of representative features for classification plays the most important role in determining the performance. Previous works have not achieved satisfactory outcomes for ignoring several kinds of effective features. In this work, a novel multimodal signal decomposition and feature extraction strategy is presented to obtain effective features for sub-band signals. Meanwhile, a rule-free refinement process based on hidden Markov model (HMM) is proposed to optimize the classification results automatically. Experimental results show the superior classification performance of the proposed method compared to state-of-the-art works, wherein the rule-free refinement also outperforms previous rule-based correction algorithms. This sleep stage classification method is expected to contribute to the design of home-based sleep monitoring and analyzing system. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Spiking neural P systems (SN P systems, in short) are the latest branch of membrane computing; inspired by the biological behavior of spiking neurons. They are considered true distributed and parallel systems; modeled to solve time consumption problem and presented the concept of parallelism usage in the computing field. This paper proposes novel strategies for solving non-determinism problem of SN P systems. The proposed algorithm relies on the parallelism feature to simulate the social hierarchy, tracking, encircling, and attacking behaviors in the grey wolf optimizer. It is modeled by collaboration between a set of SN P systems to get a feasible solution in polynomial time. Moreover, a new method named the power of signal is proposed to control the copying spikes process between neurons and differentiate between the arithmetic operations. Additionally, a time control approach is proposed to avoid non-determinism inside neurons that applied the determinism feature during firing rules. The theoretical and empirical experiments proved that the algorithm can successfully halt and in addition to the effectiveness of the proposed neural systems in getting an optimal solution in a reasonable time. As a result, this study is counted as a significant advancement in intelligent and optimization systems, whereas it has a direct impact on enhancing the performance of these systems and their applications.

AB In recent years, artificial intelligence and machine learning technology have made great progress and development. Various novel models have been constructed to enhance prediction performance of binary classification from different aspects. Credit scoring model is a typical application of artificial intelligence and machine learning technology. In this study, we propose a novel multi-stage hybrid model, which combines feature selection and classifier selection to obtain optimal feature subset and optimal classifier subset, then uses classifier ensemble to improve the prediction performance based on the two optimal subsets mentioned above. We also extend genetic algorithm, i.e., propose an enhanced multi-population niche genetic algorithm (EMPNGA), to improve the ability of optimization effectively by enhancing the selection, crossover, and mutation steps, and adding niche and migration steps. Furthermore, EMPNGA is applied to combine several filter methods and priori knowledge in feature selection and classifier selection respectively to further increase the search efficiency. The proposed model is applied to credit scoring to verify its prediction performance. Finally, five datasets and four evaluation metrics are applied in the experiment. The experimental results confirm that the performance of proposed model is superior to the other comparative models, proving that this study is of significance and effectiveness.

AB Cancer is a dangerous disease that causes death worldwide. Discovering few genes relevant to one cancer disease can result in effective treatments. The challenge associated with the Microarray datasets is its high dimensionality; the huge number of features compared to the modest number of samples in these datasets. Recent research efforts attempted to reduce this high-dimensionality using different feature selection techniques. This paper presents an ensemble feature selection technique based on t-test and genetic algorithm. After preprocessing the data using t-test, a Nested Genetic Algorithm, namely Nested-GA, is used to get the optimal subset of features by combining data from two different datasets. Nested-GA consists of two Nested Genetic Algorithms (outer and inner) that run on two different kinds of datasets. The Outer Genetic Algorithm (OGA-SVM) works on Microarray gene expression datasets, whereas the Inner Genetic Algorithm (IGA-NNW) runs on DNA Methylation datasets. Nested-GA is performed on a colon cancer dataset with 5-fold cross validation. After applying Nested-GA, the Incremental Feature Selection (IFS) strategy is used to get the smallest optimal genes subset. The genes subset has been validated on an independent dataset resulting in 99.9% classification accuracy. Consequently, the biological significance of the resulting optimal genes is validated using Enrichment Analysis. Moreover, the results of Nested-GA have been compared to the results of other feature selection algorithms that have been run on either Gene Expression or DNA Methylation datasets. From the experimental results, Nested-GA showed the highest classification performance with a small optimal feature subset compared to the other algorithms. Furthermore, by running Nested-GA on lung cancer datasets that contain two different cancer subtypes, it resulted in significantly better classification accuracy (98.4%) compared to the accuracy of a previous research (84.6%) that utilized lung cancer DNA-Methylation data only.

AB Class imbalanced learning is a well-known issue, which exists in real-world applications. Datasets that have skewed class distribution raise hindrance to the traditional learning algorithms. Traditional classifiers give the same importance to all the samples, which leads to the prediction biased towards the majority classes. To solve this intrinsic deficiency, numerous strategies have been proposed such as weighted extreme learning machine (WELM), weighted support vector machine (WSVM), class-specific extreme learning machine (CS-ELM) and class-specific kernelized extreme learning machine (CSKELM). This work focuses on multiclass imbalance problems, which are more difficult compared to the binary class imbalance problems. Kernelized extreme learning machine (KELM) yields better results compared to the traditional extreme learning machine (ELM), which uses random input parameters. This work presents a generalized CSKELM (GCSKELM), the extension of our recently proposed CSKELM, which addresses the multiclass imbalanced problems more effectively. The proposed GCSKELM can be applied directly to solve the multiclass imbalanced problems. GCSKELM with Gaussian kernel function avoids the non-optimal hidden node problem associated with CS-ELM and other existing variants of ELM. The proposed work also has less computational cost in contrast with kernelized WELM (KWELM) for multiclass imbalanced learning. This work employs class-specific regularization parameters, which are determined by employing class proportion. The extensive experimental analysis shows that the proposed work obtains promising generalization performance in contrast with the other state-of-the-art imbalanced learning methods.

AB Networked data is data composed of network objects and links. Network objects are characterized by high dimensional attributes and by links indicating the relationships among these objects. However, traditional feature selection and feature extraction methods consider only attribute information, thus ignoring link information. In the presented work, we propose a new unsupervised binary feature construction method (NetBFC) for networked data that reconstructs attributes for each object by exploiting link information. By exploring similar objects in the network and associating them, our method increases the similarities between objects with high probability of being in the same group. The proposed method enables local attribute enrichment and local attribute selection for each object by aggregating the attributes of similar objects in order to deal with the sparsity of networked data. In addition, this method applies an attribute elimination phase to eliminate irrelevant and redundant attributes which decrease the performance of clustering algorithms. Experimental results on real-world data sets indicate that NetBFC significantly achieves better performance when compared to baseline methods. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a comparative analysis of the outcomes achieved when two widely applied methods for supplier selection-the 'technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution' (TOPSIS) and 'data envelopment analysis'-are applied to the problem of identifying the most preferred sustainable suppliers. Both fuzzy DEA and fuzzy TOPSIS are applied to a common dataset of logistics service providers in Sweden. The results reveal that TOPSIS outperforms DEA in terms of both calculation complexity and sensitivity to changes in the number of suppliers. However, output rankings from the two models are found to be less than perfectly correlated. The paper concludes that utilizing both methods, as applied to just a small number of evaluation criteria and a relatively low level of detail in the data, produces a useful pooled shortlist of potential sustainable suppliers. This can then form the basis for a second stage application where either of the methods may be applied to a greater number of criteria that are specified to a higher level of detail. Even more critically, the results also have the potential to point to specific aspects for discussion when negotiating price and service quality commitments with potential sustainable suppliers.

ID NUMBER
AB Expert and intelligent systems use a variety of machine learning techniques to obtain and understand the information inherent in the data. Clustering is one of these techniques, which has become important and popular since it allows classifying an unlabeled dataset into clusters of similar objects. There are many clustering algorithms that have been proposed in the literature. From these algorithms, the Cross-Clustering algorithm is one of the most recent clustering algorithms for partial clustering (clustering where not necessarily all the objects are grouped into clusters), which has provided good results allowing estimating a suitable set of clusters, as well as eliminating outliers. However, this algorithm tends to eliminate too many objects as outliers, which leads to discard a lot of non-outlier objects. Additionally, the Cross-Clustering algorithms spends a lot of time evaluating several combinations of clusterings, trying to determine a suitable number of clusters. To overcome these problems, in this paper, an improved version of the Cross-Clustering algorithm (ICC) is proposed. ICC changes the clustering algorithm used for detecting outliers, as well as it modifies the way outliers are detected. Moreover, a stop criterion allowing to make a fast decision on the estimation of a suitable number of cluster, is also introduced. The performance of the improved Cross-Clustering algorithm is compared with the original algorithm on artificial and real datasets. Our results show that ICC improves the original algorithm and other state of the art clustering algorithms; in both, runtime and clustering quality. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Machine learning methods have become an indispensable tool for utilizing large knowledge and data repositories in science and technology. In the context of the pharmaceutical domain, the amount of acquired knowledge about the design and synthesis of pharmaceutical agents and bioactive molecules (drugs) is enormous. The primary challenge for automatically discovering new drugs from molecular screening information is related to the high dimensionality of datasets, where a wide range of features is included for each candidate drug. Thus, the implementation of improved techniques to ensure an adequate manipulation and interpretation of data becomes mandatory. To mitigate this problem, our tool (called D2-MCS) can split homogeneously the dataset into several groups (the subset of features) and subsequently, determine the most suitable classifier for each group. Finally, the tool allows determining the biological activity of each molecule by a voting scheme.

AB Daily traffic flow forecasting is critical in advanced traffic management and can improve the efficiency of fixed-time signal control. This paper presents a traffic prediction method for one whole day using a deep neural network based on historical traffic flow data and contextual factor data. The main idea is that traffic flow within a short time period is strongly correlated with the starting and ending time points of the period together with a number of other contextual factors, such as day of week, weather, and season. Therefore, the relationship between the traffic flow values within a given time interval and a combination of contextual factors can be mined from historical data. First, a predictor was trained using a multi-layer supervised learning algorithm to mine the potential relationship between traffic flow data and a combination of key contextual factors. To reduce training times, a batch training method was proposed. Finally, a Seattle-based case study shows that, overall, the proposed method outperforms the conventional traffic prediction method in terms of prediction accuracy. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Transportation problems are essential in commercial logistics and have been widely studied in the literature during the last decades. Many of them consist in designing routes for vehicles to move commodities between locations. This article approaches a pickup-and-delivery single-vehicler outing problem where there is susceptibility to uncertainty in customer requests. The probability distributions of the requests are assumed to be known, and the objective is to design an a priori route with minimum expected length. The problem has already been approached in the literature, but through a heuristic method. This article proposes the first exact approach to the problem. Two mathematical formulations are proposed: one is a compact model (i.e. defined by a polynomial number of variables and constraints); the other one contains an exponential number of inequalities and is solved within a branch-and-cut framework. Computational results show the upsides as well as the breakdowns of both formulations. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The significant increase in vehicle numbers leads to adverse traffic congestion. Existing pheromone-based vehicle routing randomly assigns an alternative route to vehicles based on global distance and local pheromone intensity. Although urban congestion is reduced as vehicles are assigned paths with lower pheromone intensity, frequent stops due to numerous red signalized intersections within the paths can lead to high fuel consumption. To address this issue, a proactive Eco-friendly Pheromone-based Green Vehicle Routing (E-PGVR) strategy is proposed to prioritize the greener aspects of routing by reducing fuel consumption in addition to traffic congestion. First, paths with multiple green signalized intersections are assigned to increase the chance for vehicles to traverse multiple intersections with fewer stops, marking down fuel consumption. Second, the application of local dynamic information namely traffic light time, mean road speed, and predicted pheromone intensity encourages the implementation of a decentralized Hierarchical Multi-Agent Pheromone-based System (HMAPS). Third, a modified dynamic k-shortest path algorithm is proposed in the path assignment to reduce computational effort. Forth, Singapore traffic data that incorporates heterogeneous vehicle type is employed in the microscopic simulator (SUMO) to model real-world traffic scenario. Experiment results show that the proposed E-PGVR outperforms other approaches in reducing fuel consumption and CO2 by 21.2%, mean waiting time by 30.0%, number of congested roads by 56.9%, mean travel time by 26.3%, and increasing number of arrived vehicles by 45.5%.

AB People with type 1 diabetes must control their blood glucose level through insulin infusion either with several daily injections or with an insulin pump. However, estimating the required insulin dose is not easy. Recommender systems, mainly based on Case-Based Reasoning (CBR), are being developed to provide recommendations to users. These systems are designed to keep the experiences or cases of the user in a case-base, which requires maintenance to keep system's response accurate and efficient. This paper proposes a case-base maintenance methodology that combines case-base redundancy reduction and attribute weight learning. Contrary to previous approaches designed for classification problems, the maintenance methodology presented in this paper deals with numerical recommendations. It can manage a potentially huge case-base due to the combinatorial derived from the number of attributes used to represent a case. The proposed approach has been tested using the OVA/PADOVA type 1 diabetes simulator and the results demonstrate that it can accomplish better levels of accuracy than other insulin recommender systems mentioned in the literature, when a large number of attributes is considered.

AB This paper proposes an iterated greedy algorithm for scheduling jobs in F parallel flow shops (lines), each consisting of a series of m machines without storage capacity between machines. This constraint can provoke the blockage of machines if a job has finished its operation and the next machine is not available. The criterion considered is the minimization of the sum of tardiness of all the jobs to schedule, i.e., minimization of the total tardiness of jobs. Notice that the proposed method is also valid for solving the Distributed Permutation Blocking Flow Shop Scheduling Problem (DBFSP), which allows modelling the scheduling process in companies with more than one factory when each factory has an identical flow shop configuration. Firstly, several constructive procedures have been implemented and tested to provide an efficient solution in terms of quality and CPU time. This initial solution is later improved upon with an iterated greedy algorithm that includes a variable neighbourhood search for interchanging or reassigning jobs from the critical line to other lines. Next, two strategies have been tested for selecting the critical line; the one with a higher total tardiness of jobs and the one with a job that has the highest tardiness. The experimental design chooses the best combination of initial solution and critical line selection. Finally, we compare the performance of the proposed algorithm against other benchmark algorithms proposed for the DPFSP, which have been adapted to the problem being considered here since, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to solve either the Parallel Blocking Flow Shop problem or the Distributed Blocking Flow Shop problem with the goal of minimizing total tardiness. This comparison has allowed us to confirm the good performance of the proposed method. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Regression is a predictive analysis tool that examines the relationship between independent and dependent variables. The goal of this analysis is to fit a mathematical function that describes how the value of the response changes when the values of the predictors vary. The simplest form of regression is linear regression which in the case multiple regression, tries to explain the data by simply fitting a hyperplane minimising the absolute error of the fitting. Piecewise regression analysis partitions the data into multiple regions and a regression function is fitted to each one. Such an approach is the OPLRA (Optimal Piecewise Linear Regression Analysis) model (Yang, Liu, Tsoka, & Papage, 2016) which is a mathematical programming approach that optimally partitions the data into multiple regions and fits a linear regression functions minimising the Mean Absolute Error between prediction and truth. However, using many regions to describe the data can lead to overfitting and bad results. In this work an extension of the OPLRA model is proposed that deals with the problem of selecting the optimal number of regions as well as overfitting. To achieve this result, information criteria such as the Akaike and the Bayesian are used that reward predictive accuracy and penalise model complexity. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Every single strand of DNA consists of 10 sequences of nucleotides. These sequences cannot be separated or randomly arranged because each sequence of DNA contains a certain genomic encoding. When a virus mutates, a drug or vaccine for that virus that has been given to a patient will become useless. Therefore, there is a need for a method of analysing the likely direction of DNA mutation so that preventative measures can be adapted more quickly. RNA-type viruses are able to alter the patterns of infected DNA, which is one way for such a virus to defend itself. In this paper, we propose a new hybrid clustering method that combines K-means, fuzzy C-means, and hierarchical clustering to predict the direction of DNA mutation trends. We have combined these three different approaches in a hybrid clustering method and tested it on two data sets of 1000 isolated positive hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected and non-infected DNA strands with 37 HCV primers. We compare the results with those of eight other clustering methods, and the comparison shows that our method achieves sensitivity and specificity values of 0.998. The level of precision of cluster division is also 0.004 higher than that of the next highest among the eight methods considered for comparison. From this study, the primer trends that most often appear in isolated DNA can be found, and the origins of these trends in isolated DNA can be inferred. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Detection of fraudulent transactions is a vital factor for financial institutions, and finding more effective and accurate methods is of tremendous importance. The use of supervised data mining techniques is not feasible in many cases due to the lack of access to labeled data. Fraud detection is a complex task, and unsupervised methods like clustering and outlier detection techniques employed alone do not yield satisfactory results. Another issue is epistemic uncertainty due to the absence of sufficient information on the behavioral aspects of different customers, which also leads to poorer results for fraud detection and makes the fraud detection system inapplicable in real world environment. In this paper, using multi criteria decision method, intuitionistic fuzzy set, and evidential reasoning, a new method for detection of fraud was introduced, which infuses several behavioral evidence of a transaction concerning the effect of uncertainty for them. Transactional behavior was modeled by considering the trends of different main and aggregated variables at different periods and the extent of deviation of the new arrived transaction from each of these trends were considered as behavioral evidence. The final belief, which is the result of the combination of much evidence using the proposed method, will determine the originality of a newly arrived transaction. Finally, using a real world dataset, the results of the new method were compared with the results of Dempster-Shafer method in terms of the number of frauds discovered and the number of erroneous alerts they issued. The findings showed that the method introduced in this study has higher accuracy and lower false alarms compared to Dempster-Shafer method while the computational complexity of this method makes its implementation time longer.

AB Despite the fact that the potential of multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) to overcome a variety of problems in mining and mineral processing has been widely recognised, no literature review in these fields has been conducted. This manuscript addresses this issue by providing a comprehensive overview of the applications and trends of MCDM methods for the choice problem (i.e., determining the best option from a set) in mining and mineral processing. 90 articles published between 1999 and 2017 were selected following a searching methodology and eligibility criteria detailed in this manuscript. In addition, for the purpose of the survey, different types of selection problems were identified. The results show that there are two phases of growth in the application of MCDM techniques to the choice problem in mining and mineral processing. The first phase, from 1999 to 2007, shows a very low number of publications with only a moderate increase by the end, whereas the second phase, from 2007 to 2017, shows a significant growth in the number of published articles. The review also shows that the most addressed problem has been the selection of mining methods, while the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) has been the most used MCDM method. The rise in the application of hybrid MCDM methods is also discussed. This review paper provides insight into the current state of applications of MCDM in mining and mineral processing and discusses pathways for future research directions in the development of MCDM methods that would benefit these fields.

ID VALIDATION; COMPONENTS; MODEL
AB We propose novel modifications to an anomaly detection methodology based on multivariate signal reconstruction followed by residuals analysis. The reconstructions are made using Auto Associative Kernel Regression (AAKR), where the query observations are compared to historical observations called memory vectors, representing normal operation. When the data set with historical observations grows large, the naive approach where all observations are used as memory vectors will lead to unacceptable large computational loads, hence a reduced set of memory vectors should be intelligently selected. The residuals between the observed and the reconstructed signals are analysed using standard Sequential Probability Ratio Tests (SPRT), where appropriate alarms are raised based on the sequential behaviour of the residuals.
   The modifications we introduce include: a novel cluster based method to select memory vectors to be considered by the AAKR, which gives an extensive reduction in computation time; a generalization of the distance measure, which makes it possible to distinguish between explanatory and response variables; and a regional credibility estimation used in the residuals analysis, to let the time used to identify if a sequence of query vectors represents an anomalous state or not, depend on the amount of data situated close to or surrounding the query vector.
   We demonstrate how the anomaly detection method and the proposed modifications can be successfully applied for anomaly detection on a set of imbalanced benchmark data sets, as well as on recent data from a marine diesel engine in operation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A reliable Fisher discriminant model was established which was able to analyze the aroma component in milk, dairy products, flavors and fragrance, and applied on its variety identification. Foodomics was applied on screening of flavor components in 1093 dairy products and flavor samples in this study. Stepwise discrimination was used to screen the components of the dairy products and flavor samples that had a significant effect on the classification results, and discriminant function analysis. Then nine principal components were used for established the Fisher discriminant model. The three-dimensional coordinate distance of the sample was calculated and as the gist. The result showed that samples and flavors were distributed in eight different sites. The separation and clustering effects are better. The objective of the present study was to effectively determine whether or not flavors were added to dairy products.

AB Selenium (Se) is an indispensable microelement in our diet and health issues resulting from deficiencies are well documented. Se-containing food supplements are available on the market including Se-enriched Chlorella vulgaris (Se-Chlorella) which accumulates Se in the form of Se-amino acids (Se-AAs). Despite its popular uses, data about the bioaccessibility of Se-AAs from Se-Chlorella are completely missing. In the present study, gastrointestinal digestion times were optimized and the in vitro bioaccessibility of Se-AAs in Se-Chlorella, Se-yeast, a commercially available Se-enriched food supplement (Se-supplement) and Se rich foods (Se-foods) were compared. Higher bioaccessibility was found in Se-Chlorella (similar to 49%) as compared to Se-yeast (similar to 21%), Se-supplement (similar to 32%) and Se-foods. The methods used in production of Se-Chlorella biomass were also investigated. We found that disintegration increased bioaccessibility whereas the drying process had no effect. Similarly, temperature treatment by microwave oven also increased bioaccessibility whereas boiling water did not.

AB This paper discusses one of the major concerns in pesticide residue analysis: the matrix effect related to gas chromatography (GC), which can adversely affect quantification. In this study, a comparison of approaches for dealing with the matrix effect was investigated for 236 pesticides in complex matrices, including dried herbs (Centaurea cyanus L., Matricaria chamomilla L., Thymus vulgaris L.) and dried fruit (currants, chokeberry), using a modified QuEChERS method and GC-MS/MS analysis. Three approaches were evaluated: (i) using matrix-matched calibration, (ii) adding a mixture of analyte protectants (APs) to every extract or (iii) injection prior to GC-MS/MS analysis. Finally, minimization of the matrix effect to the acceptable levels of -20 to 20% for over 80% of investigated pesticides was found when APs mixture was injected at the beginning of the sequence. In this approach, the matrix effects were significantly weaker for some pesticides than when matrix-matched calibration was used.

AB Agarose was successfully modified with octenyl succinic anhydride (OSA) and the factors affecting OSA modifying process were studied. The degree of substitution (DS) could be regulated from 0.02 to 0.21 by changing the reaction condition, simultaneously the molecular weight of the OSA-agarose (OSAG) varied from 342 kD to 483 kD. FT-IR spectrum of the OSAG at 1734 cm(-1) and 1576 cm(-1) revealed characteristic absorption peaks of the ester carbonyl groups (C=0) and the carboxylate (RCOO- ), respectively. NMR spectrum of the OSAG suggested the main substitution occurred at the C-2 in the D-galactopyranose. The SEM image of agarose showed the porous network structure became dense and the fiber became thin after OSA modification. Compared with original agarose, the prepared OSAG showed novel physical properties including low gelling and melting temperature and high transparency. The remaining gelation ability and newly introduced amphiphilic character anticipate potential application as functional polysaccharide materials in foods.

OLE/SA ratio 1:1.6 and inlet air temperature 135 degrees C were the optimal conditions for OLE-SA microparticles. ORP (70%) from OLE was degraded during gastric digestion, giving hydroxytyrosol and ORP-aglycone, whereas only the superficial ORP was released from microparticles. The remaining ORP from OLE was degraded under intestinal conditions, leading to oleosides; whereas alginate was swollen and disintegrated, releasing the ORP (90% of encapsulated ORP). ORP from both OLE and microparticles was degraded to hydroxytyrosol under colonic conditions. Encapsulation of OLE allowed the protection of ORP under gastric conditions and its controlled release at intestinal conditions, and higher bioaccessibility (58%) and potential bioavailability (20%).

AB Peptide profiles of hydrolyzed oat proteins and the susceptibility of their polypeptides to proteolytic cleavages were determined using peptidomic analysis. In addition, antioxidant activities were also measured. Proteins isolates were first extracted with carbohydrases, Viscozyme or Cellulase and then hydrolyzed with proteases (Alcalase, Papain, Protamex, Flavourzyme). Amongst the eight hydrolysates, Viscozyme-proteins hydrolyzed with Papain showed the highest ability to quench ABTS(center dot+) radicals (866.9 +/- 10.6 mu M TE/g) and to chelate ferrous ions (75 +/- 0.4%) while displaying the second strongest activity for ROO' radicals (396.7 +/- 14.0 mu M TE/g). Peptidomics analysis showed that the higher activity of papain hydrolysate in most assays was related to its greater proteolytic action on main proteins (avenin, 11S- and 12S-globulins) compared to other proteases. In addition, the number of peptides identified in the Papain digest of proteins extracted with Viscozyme was about half relative to the number in proteins from bran treated with Cellulase and digested with the same protease. This was likely because the carbohydrases differently affected polypeptide secondary structures.

AB Precision viticulture (PV) is a relatively new discipline, whose development started in the 1990s. PV aims at adjusting vineyard management to the spatial variability that naturally appears in the field in order to increase its economic and environmental sustainability. Despite the rapid growth of PV in the last two decades, there is little PV research taking advantage of the great potential advanced analytics could provide to this field. PV and advanced analytics, working altogether, could provide not only a more suitable evaluation of the benefits of PV implementation for growers, but also a better understanding of the vineyard internal factors that determine grape composition, as most of the external factors behind sources of variability are fixed when working in a single field.

AB Blueberry wine is a new fruit wine with good taste and rich nutrition, but color change and anthocyanins (ACNs) content readily decrease during the production process. The effects of different content (0.2 g/L, 0.25 g/L, and 0.3 g/L) of mannoprotein (MP) on the blueberry wine were investigated in this study. The result showed that MP treatment inhibited the decrease in ACN content, reduced the content of total acid, increased the content of alcohol content in blueberry wine, maintained the color and improved the taste of blueberry wine. In addition, the effect was more pronounced as the MP concentration increased, with the optimum effect at 0.3 g/L. However, MP has no significant effect on the total sugar in blueberry wine. The results arising from this study provide new insights into blueberry wine production, by which treatment with MP maintain the color and ACNs contents, and improve the taste of blueberry wine.

AB Camel milk proteins contain dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitory peptides. A camel whey protein concentrate (WPC, 44.7 +/- 3.4% (w/w) protein) was prepared and subsequently hydrolysed with trypsin at different temperatures, enzyme to substrate (E:S) ratios and hydrolysis times yielding fifteen hydrolysates (H1-H15). Their DPP-IV half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) ranged from 0.55 +/- 0.05 to 1.52 +/- 0.16 mg L-1 for H8 and H6, respectively. E:S was the only factor having a significant effect on the DPP-IV IC50 value (p < 0.05). Relatively potent alpha-lactalbumin-derived DPP-IV inhibitory peptides (LAHKPL and ILDKEGIDY) were detected in selected hydrolysates. Additionally, three potent beta-CN-derived peptides, VPV, YPI and VPF having DPP-IV IC50 values of 6.6 +/- 0.5, 35.0 +/- 2.0 and 55.1 +/- 5.8 mu M, respectively, were identified. After IPI, VPV is the second most potent DPP-IV inhibitory peptide identified to date, which supports the role of camel milk as an antidiabetic agent.

AB The glycosides are presumed to influence the quality of green tea but the molecular mechanism behind remains unclear. To elucidate the contribution of glycosides to the flavor formation of green tea, changes of both glycosidically bound non-volatiles (GBNVs) and glycosidically bound volatiles (GBVs) during the manufacturing of green tea were investigated using a modification-specific metabolomics method. A total of 64 glycosides (47 GBNVs and 17 GBVs) were identified and their contents mainly changed during the pan firing and drying stages of green tea manufacturing. Notably, the contents of GBVs significantly increased by 1.12-4.46-fold during pan firing. Correlation analysis showed that the GBVs contents were negatively related to the contents of volatiles and glucose. Model experiments revealed that enzymatic synthesis contributed to the increase in the content of GBVs during the pan firing. This comprehensive study on the glycosides changes revealed the molecular bases for GBVs increments during the pan firing.

AB Predominant flavonoids in cereals and pulses are structurally different and may positively interact to enhance bioactivity in combined diet. This work investigated the effects of combined cereal 3-deoxyflavonoids (apigenin, naringenin) and pulse flavonols (quercetin), along with natural extracts, on their bioavailability and underlying mechanisms using Caco-2 monolayer model. Membrane permeability, phase II metabolism, and ATP binding cassette (ABC) membrane transporter expression and function were measured. Apparent absorption of quercetin and apigenin increased (p < 0.05) 3.3 x and 1.5 x, respectively, while both compounds were significantly less metabolized in combined treatments. Combinations with naringenin had insignificant effect, suggesting a role for flavonoid C2=C3 conjugation. Both natural extracts and apigenin-quercetin combinations synergistically (3-40 fold) downregulated ABC transporter expression, and inhibited P-glycoprotein activity, suggesting direct binding and inhibition of ATPase. Combination of conjugated cereal and pulse flavonoids enhances their potential bioavailability through synergistic inhibition of membrane transporter and phase II enzyme function.

AB The hard milk fat (HMF) fraction of milk fat was isolated via dry, thermal fractionation, followed by a solvent washing process. The resulting HMF crystals were visibly free of entrapped liquid fat, and subsequently characterised by thermal analysis, X-ray diffraction, and electron microscopy. The HMF crystals were found to be mostly beta' and beta(2)' crystalline structures, with a lamellar thickness of 42.7-44.1 angstrom. Additionally, crystal size was determined to be >= 1 mu m in length and 0.4-1 mu m in width. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to further characterise the HMF crystals. AFM enabled 3D mapping and visualisation of crystal layering, as well as simple determination of layer thickness (similar to 4.2 +/- 0.8 nm); a value in close agreement with the results obtained via X-ray analysis. The AFM characterisation approach provides a simple method of characterising HMF crystals, without suffering the limitations of other widely used techniques.

AB Hydroxytyrosyl esters with short, medium and long acyl chains were evaluated for their ability to reduce nitric oxide (NO) production by lipopolysaccharide-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages. Among the compounds tested, C18 esters, namely hydroxytyrosyl stearate (HtySte) and hydroxytyrosyl oleate (HtyOle), were found to decrease NO production in a concentration-dependent manner, while the other compounds, including the parent hydroxytyrosol, were ineffective in the tested concentration range (0.5-5 mu M). Further study of the potential immune-modulating properties of HtyOle revealed a significant and concentration-dependent suppression of prostaglandin E-2 production. At a transcriptional level, HtyOle inhibited the expression of inducible NO synthase, cyclooxygenase-2 and interleukin-1 beta. Moreover, HtyOle was identified for the first time in olive oil by-products by means of high performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. By contrast, HtyOle was not found in intact olives. Our results suggest that HtyOle is formed during oil processing and represents a significant form in which hydroxytyrosol occurs.

AB The effects of ultrasound and acid on the aggregation, structures and emulsifying properties of soybean protein isolate (SPI) were investigated. Results of solubility showed that ultrasonic treatments at 0.001 M HCl increased the content of soluble SPI. The particle size of soluble aggregates subjected to ultrasonication and acid was initially decreased and then increased with increasing ultrasonic time. Secondary structure analysis, by circular dichroism, indicated lower a-helix and higher random coil amounts in SPI treated with short ultrasonic time, in contrast to the higher a-helix and lower random coil in SPI treated with longer time (more than 20 min). Emulsions prepared with SPI by 10 min of ultrasonication demonstrated significantly (P < 0.05) small droplet sizes and long term stability in comparison with their untreated counterparts. These results highlight that the emulsifying properties of SPI can be significantly improved by the synergistic effect of ultrasound and acid.

AB The effect of cold plasma processing time and gas flow on bioactive compounds such as vitamin C, carotenoids and phenolic compounds, DPPH, angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity, fatty acids profile, and volatile compounds of guava-flavored whey beverage was investigated. For comparative purposes, a pasteurized beverage was also manufactured. Cold plasma increased the concentration of bioactive and volatile compounds, and proportionated changes in the fatty acids profile. The milder conditions like lower flow rate and processing time, resulted in higher vitamin C and volatile compounds levels, and higher antioxidant activity, but with a lower carotenoids content and a less favorable fatty acids profile. More drastic conditions like higher flow rate and processing time resulted in products with lower vitamin C and volatile compounds levels, but with higher carotenoids content and ACE inhibitory activity. It can be concluded that the cold plasma processing can improve the properties of the guava-flavored whey beverages (increased concentration of bioactive and volatile compounds), while the effect on the fatty acid profile and ACE inhibitory activity is dependent on the process parameters (processing time and flow rate).

AB Micromeria fruticosa is an important crop, is widely used in the Mediterranean basin as food and in folk medicine, owing to its health-promoting properties, partially due to the secondary metabolite composition. However, complete information on the phyto-metabolites in M. fruticosa is still lacking. Plant leaves were extracted in methanol (80%), then the phyto-metabolites were separated on C18 column and an extensive characterization using UHPLC-DAD-ESI-QTOE-MS2 method in two ionization modes was established. A total of 215 phenolics and other compounds were tentatively identified, offering the first comprehensive study available on the phytochemicals from M. fruticosa. Over 180 phytochemicals (87 flavonoids, 41 phenolic acids, 16 terpenoids, 8 sulfate derivatives, 7 iridoids, and others) are reported in Micromeria for the first time. M. fruticosa can be a promising source of functional ingredients and has use in the food, pharma and nutraceutical industries.

AB A nanoflow liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry method for the quantification of mycotoxins in nuts has been developed. Two strategies based on QuEChERS methodology were evaluated. Thus, EMR lipid was compared with a conventional mixture of PSA and C18 dispersive solid phase extraction sorbents which have been commonly used in this type of matrices as sample clean-up. The results showed that the use of EMR-lipid reduced more effectively matrix components, achieving a negligible matrix effect for all mycotoxins studied in peanut, pistachio and almond. The proposed method was validated in line with SANTE guidelines using EMR-Lipid as dispersive solid phase extraction sorbent. The lowest concentration level were between 0.05 and 5 mu g kg(-1) , being lower than the maximum levels established by the current legislation. Recovery rates ranged from 75% to 98% was obtained in all sample studied, achieving also satisfactory precision with RSD values lower than 19% in all cases.

AB The consumption of pomegranate juice (PJ) has increased substantially since scientific literature reported its therapeutic benefits that are attributable to antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-carcinogenic, and anti-inflammatory properties. The growing consumer demands for fresh and high-quality food products have led to the interest in non-thermal technologies for preservation of fruit juices. Although thermal pasteurization is the most widely used preservation technology, it has adverse effects on the nutritional and sensory quality of juices. Conversely, non-thermal technologies are suitable alternatives for preservation and without negative effects on the quality. However, there is limited scientific literature concerning the use of non-thermal technologies for preservation of PJ. Therefore, this review focuses on PJ preservation by using non-thermal technologies. In conclusion, pomegranate is an economical crop that can justify the use of advanced non-thermal technologies for PJ preservation, as consumers' interest can offset the expenses associated with investments in alternative technological options and processing adjustments.

AB The co-pigmentation of black chokeberry (Aronia melanocarpa) anthocyanins with ten phenolic co-pigments was studied. Tested compounds provoked different co-pigmentation effect, manifested by hyperchromic and batochromic shifts. The co-pigmentation was accompanied by a magnification of color intensity and decrease of color hue, both related to a more pleasant color. The hyperchromic effect was the most significant for rosmarinic acid (51.02%), syringic acid (43.24%) and catechin (39.73%). However, it was observed at the highest pigment/copigment ratio (1:50), not achievable in plant matter. Targeting the potential practical application of co-pigmentation, we tested eight herbal extracts for their co-pigmentation ability with aronia anthocyanins. The use of herbal extracts led to a significant hyperchromic effect at much lower pigment/co-pigment ratios, compared to pure compounds. The use of selected herbal extracts as co-pigments opens realistic prospects for development of aronia functional foods with improved sensory properties and biological effects, due to enhanced color and anthocyanin stability.

AB The present study shows a relationship between the use of organic or conventional practices and the allergenic properties and the bioactive compound content of apricots. The presented results indicate that organic apricots contain significantly more biologically active compounds from polyphenols group 53.75 mg/100 g FW and 31.52 mg/100 g FW and carotenoids 10.90 mg/100 g FW and 8.42 mg/100 g FW in than conventional apricots from polyphenols 16.83 mg/100 g FW and 27.27 mg/100 g FW and carotenoids 4.01 mg/100 g FW and 3.85 mg/ 100 g FW. Organic fruits are characterized by a higher allergenic potential. The authors of the current research have found a strong relationship between the content of polyphenolic compounds and the content of allergenic proteins for organic apricots R-2 = 0.9044 and for conventional apricots R-2 = 0.8169. The main conclusion is that some organic apricots, despite their better quality, would not be recommended for consumption by allergy sufferers.

AB Pleurotus geesteranus has recently been gaining popularity due to its strong umami taste. In the present study, umami taste, energy level, and energy metabolism-related enzymes activity in harvested P. geesteranus, stored at 20, 10, 5, and 0 degrees C, were investigated to evaluate the relationship between umami taste and energy status. Results showed that the mushroom at 5 degrees C exhibited significantly higher (p < 0.05) equivalent umami concentration (EUC), higher content of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), adenosine diphosphate (ADP), adenosine monophosphate (AMP), and higher activity of succinic dehydrogenase (SDH) and cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) in late storage. AMP, associating umami taste with energy, presented a significantly positive correlation with EUC and umami determined by electronic tongue at 5 degrees C. Furthermore, there were better correlations between umami taste and energy status of mushroom at 5 degrees C. The results suggest that higher energy status of post-harvest P. geesteranus contributes to better umami taste.

AB In the present study, a rapid and effective method based on alendronate sodium grafted mesoporous magnetic nanoparticle (Fe3O4@ANDS) extraction for the determination of trans-resveratrol (TRA) in peanut oils was developed by coupling with HPLC-UV detection. The Fe3O4@ANDS was prepared via Lewis acid/base interaction which was simply carried out in mild aqueous condition without the using of organic solvent. The resultant Fe3O4@ANDS encompassed amino group on its surface, and it was employed as magnetic solid-phase extraction adsorbent for purification and enrichment of TRA from peanut oils through hydrogen bond interaction. Under the optimized conditions, the whole pretreatment process could be accomplished within 10 min without time-consuming concentrated and reconstituted process. The linearity range of the proposed method was 1-10,000 ng/g with satisfactory correlation coefficient (R-2) of 0.9992. The recoveries in spiked oil samples were in the range of 78.6-118.9% with the RSDs less than 3.3% (intra-day) and 15.2% (inter-day). The limit of detection for TRA in peanut oils was 0.3 ng/g which was comparative to the reported methods by using LC-MS/MS detection. Finally, the established method was successfully applied to the analysis of TRA in several peanut oils with different brands from local market as well as other kinds of vegetable oils.

AB The effect of the thickness and density of droplet interfacial membrane on the chemical stability of beta-carotene in emulsions was investigated, and its impact on the effectiveness of oil-soluble antioxidants to retard beta-carotene degradation was examined. beta-Carotene was incorporated into the emulsions stabilized by PEGylated emulsifiers having various-sized hydrophilic groups. In the presence of oxidative stresses (pH, iron ions, and radicals in this study), it was observed that the interfacial thickness was relevant to the stability of beta-carotene encapsulated into emulsion droplets. Particularly, iron-mediated carotene degradation was effectively retarded in the emulsions having a thin interfacial membrane than ones with a thick interfacial membrane. The interfacial denseness also affected beta-carotene stability but its ability to retard beta-carotene degradation was influenced by the interfacial thickness. Although beta-carotene degradation rate decreased upon the addition of oil-soluble antioxidants, its antioxidant activity depended on what prooxidant promoted the degradation of beta-carotene in the emulsions.

AB Spinach intake has long been highlighted globally because of its outstanding nutritional aspects. In this study, changes in flavonoids, a representative functional phytochemical group, were investigated by UPLC-QTof MS with multivariate analysis of winter-spinach samples from three different cultivation regions in Korea. From the partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), the differences of flavonoids among the geographic locations were clearly distinguished. Seven spinach flavonoids (2, patuletin-3-O-glucosyl-(1 -> 6)-glucoside; 4, spi-nacetin-3-O-glucosyl-(1 -> 6)- [apiosyl-(1 -> 2)]-glucoside; 8, patuletin 3-O-(2 ''-feruloylglucosyl)-(1 -> 6)- [apiosyl-(1 -> 2)]-glucoside; 11, spinacetin 3-O-(2 ''-feruloylglucosyl)-(1 -> 6)- [apiosyl-(1 -> 2)]-glucoside; 12, patuletin 3-O-(2 ''-feruloylglucosyl)-(1 -> 6)-glucoside; 18, 5,3',4'-trihydroxy-3-methoxy-6:7-methylendioxyflavone-4'-glucuronide; 20, 5,4'-dihydroxy-3,3'-dimethoxy-6:7-methylendioxyflavone-4'-glucuronide) were evaluated as key markers among 20 isolated metabolites. Interestingly, the contents of individual marker were significantly different among the groups, though total amount of flavonoids were almost same. Additionally, policosanols (PCs) in the winter-spinach was examined quantitatively using GC-MS for the first time. The PCs were analyzed as the range of 53.6-59.2 mg/100 g, indicate that the winter-spinach is a beneficial source of PCs.

AB Milk fat globule membrane (MFGM) proteins have been shown to be very sensitive to processing. This study aims to investigate the thermos-stability of human, bovine, and caprine MFGM proteins after pasteurization. The milk fat globule size was determined using confocal laser scanning microscopy. The MFGM proteins were characterized using SDS-PAGE and label-free proteomic techniques. The results indicated that pasteurization didn't influence the MFGs size distributions in these three species. A total of 1104, 632, and 137 proteins were identified in human, bovine, and caprine MFGM, respectively. The significantly changed proteins after pasteurization were mainly involved in lipid syntheses and secretion as well as immune response. In addition, the changes of these proteins also differed among species, and a higher thermo-sensitivity was observed in human and caprine MFGM proteins than bovine MFGM proteins. In sum, pasteurization affected MFGM protein composition in different extent among three species.

AB The effects of amphiphilic compounds on the dielectric constant of bulk oils were determined and the utility of the dielectric constant as a reliable parameter for predicting the oxidative stability of edible oils was evaluated. As the content of monoacylglycerols (MAGs), lecithin, and moisture increased, the dielectric constant of modified corn oil increased at different rates, whereas the addition of free fatty acids, including oleic and linoleic acid, decreased the dielectric constant of modified corn oil. Unoxidized fresh bulk oils showed a wide range of dielectric constants, from 8 for canola oils to 33 for flaxseed oils. The dielectric constant showed a strong correlation with the percentage of unsaturated fatty acids in the bulk oils. Oils with low oxidative stability had a high dielectric constant. Overall, the dielectric constant of bulk oils is strongly correlated with the content of amphiphilic compounds, moisture content, and degree of unsaturation of fatty acids.

AB In this study, resveratrol was successfully encapsulated using zein-chitosan complex coacervation. The encapsulation efficiency was markedly improved (51.4%) after chitosan coating at 1:2.5 zein/chitosan ratio, compared with 38.6% using native zein. Analysis of multi-model frequency ultrasound treatment effects on resveratrol encapsulation using zein-chitosan complex coacervation showed that 28/40 kHz dual-frequency ultrasound led to the highest encapsulation efficiency (65.2%; 31.9% increase) and loading capacity (5.9%; 31.1% increase) of resveratrol, followed by multi-frequency ultrasound at 20/28/40 kHz (17.8% encapsulation efficiency increase; 17.8% loading capacity increase). Dual-frequency ultrasound treatment significantly reduced the zein-chitosan complex coacervation particle size and reduced their distribution, however, did not change the zeta potential. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy analysis demonstrated that ultrasound treatment had no effect on secondary structure of zein-chitosan complex but markedly decreased the fluorescence emission intensity. Differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffraction results indicated that Dual-frequency ultrasound treatment improved the thermal stability of zein-chitosan complex coacervation but had no effect on the crystal structure. Atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy images revealed uniform distribution of zein-chitosan complex coacervation followed by ultrasonic treatment.

ID ENRICHMENT; EXTRACTION; CULTURE; GROWTH
AB Selenium (Se) and sulfur (S) speciation analysis in edible and medicinal Se enriched P. pulmonarius extracts was performed. Mycelium, colonized substrate, and fruiting bodies at different harvesting times were analyzed using ion-pairing reversed-phase chromatography coupled to an ICPMS/MS detector. Extraction efficiencies in en-zymatically digested and aqueous extracts were between 45.3 and 109% for Se, depending on the sample type. Selenomethionine (Se-Met) was found to be the major Se-compound, together with a number of unknown Se-species. Cystine (Cys(2)), methionine (Met), and sulfate were also detected and quantified in all samples. Most of the Se-Met (84.0%) and met (75.8%) were found to be in free form in the fruiting body, in contrast with the mycelium where 53.4% of Se-Met and 80.5% of met is incorporated into proteins.

AB A novel rapid single-step cleanup method combined with quick, easy, effective, rugged, and safe (QuEChERS) extraction approach for determining multi-pesticide residues was developed. For the single-step QuEChERS (sin-QuEChERS) cleanup procedure, a specified cartridge was fitted within an extraction centrifuge tube for removing non-target substances. Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and Primary Secondary Amine (PSA) mixed with salts functioned as absorbents. Method validation was applied on 47 representative pesticides in pepper, chili peppers and chili sauce by LC-MS/MS and GC-MS/MS detection. Compared to the original QuEChERS method, the Sin-QuEChERS method was fast and convenient without any further vortex or centrifugation. Satisfactory recoveries of most pesticides at two concentration levels were in the range of 70-120% (except for pyrimethanil) with relative standard deviations (RSDs n = 5) lower than 17%. The limit of quantification (LOQs) for the 47 pesticides were 0.01 mg/kg in three matrices. Sin-QuEChERS method was successfully applied to monitor the market multi-residues.

AB In this study, a cascade screening system has been developed combining Dual Super Polymerase Chain Reaction (DSPCR) with the universal Lateral Flow Biosensor (LFB) for the ultrafast, universal and visual screening of dual GM elements, taking P-35s x T-nos for example. In the design of DSPCR for universal screening, gene-specific forward primers were labelled with biotin and gene-specific reverse primers were tagged with Cy5 and digoxin, respectively. In 2.5-min, DSPCR effectively amplified the dual target fragments through our prototype facility. Then, through specific antigen-antibody binding, a universal lateral flow biosensor exported visually dual-amplified results simultaneously without cross contamination. After optimization, the detection limit allowed 0.05% GM maize, corresponding to nine copies in maize. The entire detection process could be achieved in 10 min without any large-scale instrumentation. This method may be useful for the ultrafast, universal and visual screening of dual GM elements (P-35s x T-nos) in GM crop lines and is expected to be of great promise for rapid GMO screening and point-of-care tests.

AB Coffee is one of the most consumed beverages and has been linked to health in different studies. However, green and roasted coffees have different chemical composition and therefore their health properties might differ as well. Here, we study the effect of in vitro digestion-fermentation on the antioxidant capacity, phenolic profile, production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and gut microbiota community structure of green and roasted coffee brews. Roasted coffees showed higher antioxidant capacity than green coffees, with the highest level achieved in fermented samples. Polyphenol profile was similar between green and roasted coffees in regular coffee brews and the digested fraction, but very different after fermentation. Production of SCFAs was higher after fermentation of green coffee brews. Fermentation of coffee brews by human gut microbiota led to different community structure between green and roasted coffees. All these data suggest that green and roasted coffees behave as different types of food.

AB In the present work, three Spanish local varieties of Prunus avium (L.), as well as two foreign varieties were studied. The content of total phenols, flavonoids, anthocyanins, glucose and fructose of methanolic extracts from ripe fruits of each variety were analysed. A phytochemical profile of these cultivars was performed by UHPLC-qT0E-MS. The employed chromatographic method allowed a clear and rapid separation of the three main phenolic compound groups present in the extracts: hydroxycinnamic acids, anthocyanins and flavonoids. In addition, the extracts DPPH center dot radical scavenging ability, as well as their capacity to affect xanthine/xanthine oxidase system, were determined. Finally, variations in ROS intracellular concentrations in HepG2 cell line cultures treated with cherry extracts were measured through DCFH-DA assay. All extracts showed a significant inhibitory effect on the xanthine/xanthine oxidase system. Differences between in vitro and in cell culture results evidence the interaction among the phenolic compounds of the extract.

AB Many studies have dealt with fining treatments, focusing on their impact on phenolic precipitation or sensory properties of the treated wines. Previous articles suggested the presence of soluble complexes with tannins and fining proteins, and probably wine polysaccharides too. However, no study has quantified these possible protein residues in wine. The analyses performed on a model red wine to highlight the residual fining proteins were the measurement of viscosity, the quantification of amino acid/proteins of the samples and the radioactivity of the supernatants obtained after fining with a radioactive protein. This work has clearly shown, both qualitatively and quantitatively, the presence of fining residues in a model red wine that had been fined with a gelatin and two hydrolyzed plant proteins. These results have significant implications, yet to be confirmed with commercial fining agents and 'real' wines for allergen residues in treated wines.

AB This study compared the lipid compositions, minor components contents, oxidative stability index, and free radical scavenging capacities of walnut oils from two species in China: Juglans regia (common walnut) and Juglans sigillata (iron walnut). The results showed that iron walnut oil contained lower C16:0 (4.97-5.25%) and special fatty acid (erucic acid C22:1). Common walnut oil provided higher tocopherols (441.03-490.32 mg/kg), phytosterols (1014.49-1211.40 mg/kg), squalene (4.41-5.21 mg/kg), and polyphenols (44.78-64.61 mg GAE/kg) and better antioxidant capacities. The walnut oil of the different walnut species could be distinguished by principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis. In addition, multiple linear regression was employed to evaluate the contributions of minor components to the free radical scavenging capacity of the walnut oils and develop a predictive model for the antioxidant capacity of the oil. This information has important implications for the nutritional value and industrial production of walnut oil in China.

AB A protocol for determining the location of antioxidants (AOs) in a micro-heterogeneous medium was applied to three series of AOs with increasing hydrophobicities: chromancarboxylic acid ("Trolox") esters, caffeic acid and its esters, and gallic acid and its esters. The observed paradoxical behaviour of these and other commonly encountered antioxidants was rationalized with the aid of a pictorial simile, the "diving-swan" analogy, that explains the orientation and location of an amphiphobic AO when it reacts with a radical probe in the micellar interface.

AB The interest of food industry to merchandise natural astaxanthin is growing up. However, it confronts scientific and technological challenges mainly related to its poor water solubility and chemical instability. Here, we present a new quick and efficient green process to simultaneously extract, encapsulate and stabilize astaxanthin from Haematococcus pluvialis. The process is based on the hitherto unexplored combination of supramolecular solvents (SUPRAS), nanostructured liquids generated from amphiphiles through sequential self-assembly and coacervation, and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs). These novel nanosystems were characterized by means of dynamic light scattering, AFM and cryoSEM, revealing spherical particles of similar to 100 nm. Their antioxidant activity was measured by ORAC (20.6 +/- 3.9 mu M TE) and alpha-TEAC (2.92 +/- 0.58 mu M alpha-TE) assays and their in vitro capacity to inhibit ROS by DHE probe. Results showed that the SUPRAS-NLCs proposed yield high extraction and encapsulation efficiencies (71 +/- 4%) in combination with a remarkable time stability (180 d, 4 degrees C).

AB Deoxynivalenol (DON) is considered to be one of the most important contaminants in cereals and food cornmodifies produced thereof. So far it is not clear i) to which extent DON is degraded during baking and ii) if a degradation results in reduced toxicity. We have elucidated the fate of DON during baking of crackers, biscuits and bread, which were produced from fortified dough and processed under pilot plant conditions. Untargeted stable isotope assisted liquid chromatography (LC) high resolution mass spectrometry was used to determine all extractable degradation products. Targeted LC - tandem mass spectrometry based quantification revealed that DON was partially degraded to isoDON (1.3-3.9%), norDON B (0.2-0.9%) and norDON C (0.3-1.2%). A DON degradation of 6% (crackers), 5% (biscuits) and 2% (bread), respectively, was observed. In vitro translation experiments indicate that isoDON is less toxic than DON.

AB beta-Galactosidase is vital to dairy industries because it catalyzes the hydrolysis of lactose into glucose and galactose making it useful for lactose intolerant patients to consume milk and its products. The present study demonstrates the effect of metal ions commonly found in milk, namely Zn2+, K+, Ca2+ and Mn2+ on the activity of native and polyaniline chitosan nanocomposites bound Aspergillus oryzae beta-galactosidase. In polyaniline chitosan silver nanocomposite adsorbed beta-galactosidase, a multi-fold enhancement in catalytic activity was observed in the presence of cocktail of Zn2+, K+, Ca2+ and Mn2+ ions. 3D fluorescence, CD and FTIR studies established significant conformational changes in the secondary structure of polyaniline chitosan silver nanocomposite bound beta-galactosidase on addition of metal ions as compared to the native and other bound enzyme. This enhanced catalytic efficiency of the immobilized enzyme in presence of metal ions can promote its economic use for lactose hydrolysis in milk.

AB With in-vitro digestion and human intestinal HepG2 cells, we analyzed the bioaccessibility and cell uptake of phytochemicals and determined the cellular antioxidant capacity (CAA) of fresh eating citrus fruits. The results showed that CAA of citrus fruits was higher in digesta than in extracts, and the CAA is strongly correlated with naringenin and beta-carotene uptake (p < 0.05). During in vitro digestion, vanillic acid and p-coumaric decreased, and ferulic acid increased in all citrus fruits significantly (p < 0.05); other phytochemicals varied among the fruits. During uptake, hydroxybenzoic acids, hesperidin, narirutin, naringenin and neohesperidin were detected in cells, Zeaxanthin, lutein, beta-cryptoxanthin and beta-carotene could be detected in the citrus varieties except for pummel, but hydroxycinnamic acids and hesperitin were not detected in cells. This work provides insights into the bioaccessibility and cell uptake of phytochemicals and cellular antioxidant activity of fresh eating citrus fruits.

AB In-depth characterization of protein and lipid fractions from cow and camel milk (four breeds; CM-1 to 4), their functional and thermal properties and bioactivity upon simulated gastro-intestinal digestion was reported. Results revealed that proteins from cow and camel milk showed a noticeable separation on sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and high-performance liquid chromatography. Functional properties of whole milk proteins from cow and camel milk at different pH revealed that emulsifying activity index (EAI), foaming capacity (FC) and protein solubility was higher towards acidic and alkaline pH and lowest at isoelectric point (pH = 4). Moreover, the water absorption capacity (WAC) and solubility in water were higher in milk from cow (CW) compared to those from camel breeds (CM 1-4). Camel milk, which contains lower saturated and higher unsaturated fatty acids and demonstrated higher antioxidative and angiotensin-1 converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory potential compared to cow milk upon simulated gastro-intestinal digestion, can be considered as a healthier option.

AB A rapid method for the determination of fatty acid (FA) composition in camellia oils was developed based on the H-1 NMR technique combined with partial least squares (PLS) method. Outliers detection, LVs optimization and data pre-processing selection were explored during the model building process. The results showed the optimal models for predicting the content of C18:1, C18:2, C18:3, saturated, unsaturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated FA were achieved by Pareto scaling (Par) pretreatment, with correlation coefficient (R-2) above 0.99, the root mean square error of estimation and prediction (RMSEE, RMSEP) lower than 0.954 and 0.947, respectively. Mean-centering (Ctr) was more suitable for the model of C16:0 and C18:0 with the best performance indicators (R-2 >= 0.945, RMSEE <= 0.377, RMSEP <= 0.212). This study indicated that H-1 NMR has the potential to be applied as a rapid and routine method for the analysis of FA composition in camellia oils.

AB Citrus fruits are a rich source of bio-functional compounds with various and well-proven health properties. We focused our attention on an ancient Mediterranean species, Citrus lumia Risso. The aim of this work was to investigate the polyphenol content and biological activities of C. lumia albedo extract by cell-free and cell-based assays. Fifteen polyphenols were quantified by LC-DAD-FLD analysis (flavonoids 89.34% and phenolic acids 10.66%) with eriocitrin and hesperidin as major components (52.81% and 31.31%, respectively). These results were corroborated also by micromorphological observations, which showed clusters of needle-shaped crystals of hesperidin highlighted by TBO staining. C. lumia albedo extract revealed marked antioxidant and free radical scavenging properties, and a significant cytoprotective activity on t-BOOH-treated lymphocytes. Results indicate that C. lumia albedo extract could be exploited as an antioxidant source, suggesting the use of albedo, currently considered a by-product, as a valuable raw material for nutraceutical employments.

AB Bulky hard peel of Citrus natsudaidai is discarded and not utilized enough in Japan. In this study, the nutritional composition and volatile components of three cultivars of C. natsudaidai peel were determined. Considering the proximate composition and minerals, C. natsudaidai peels showed good carbohydrate and potassium content. The peel color varied probably due to the difference of cultivars. C. natsudaidai peels were extracted and analyzed for free amino acids and for fatty acids and volatile compounds. The amount of free amino acids in the extracts was not enough to affect the taste of extracts. The proportion of individual fatty acid was not comparable to other plant oils, however, typical aroma compounds with citrusy smell were identified. C. natsudaidai extracts could contribute for the utilization as flavoring additives without affecting taste.

AB To better understand the molecular mechanism of color formation in different varieties of the mulberry fruit, we investigated the functional genes related to anthocyanin and betulinic acid biosynthesis using high-throughput transcriptome sequencing and detected the primary and secondary metabolites in the white (Morns alba L. cv. 'Turkey') and red (Morns alba L. cv. 'Cheongil') mulberry cultivars. We obtained 171,702,058 high-quality reads with an average read length of 125 bp. These reads were assembled into 51,272 and 51,159 unigenes in Turkey and Cheongil, respectively. We also identified the genes related to anthocyanin and triterpene biosynthesis and investigated their expression and metabolite profiles. Overall, our transcriptome sequencing provides valuable information that could be used in gene discovery, marker-assisted selection, and investigation of metabolic pathways in mulberry. Additionally, gene expression and metabolite profiles provide new insights into the underlying mechanism of anthocyanin and betulinic acid biosynthesis and relationship between primary and secondary metabolites.

AB The differences in cell wall polysaccharides are considered as a major influencing factor on the texture of plant-based food after cooking. Here, 18 varieties of lotus rhizomes were collected from different regions of China and subjected to analysis, with the aim to identify the key factors that affect the texture of lotus rhizomes after cooking. The texture (hardness) of fresh samples and the samples after thermal treatment for different time periods was examined. The cell wall polysaccharides present in alcohol insoluble residue (AIR) were further subdivided into different fractions, and the composition of monosaccharides in each fraction was analyzed by gas chromatography. We then calculated the sugar ratios to examine the discrepancies in molecular structure among the fractions. Principal component analysis and regression analysis showed that the ratio of chelate-soluble fraction (CSF) to AIR is the major factor affecting the texture of lotus rhizomes after cooking.

AB A package was created that extends apple shelf-life by slowing Penicillium expansum growth. The package consisted of a peelable lid and a tray with a double bottom with inclusion complexes (ICs) of beta-cyclodextrin (8CD) containing the essential oils of palmarosa (ICp) or of star anise (ICsa). Oil amounts required for antimicrobial activity were obtained from in vitro assays. After 12 days at 23 degrees C, P. expansum-inoculated apples in both of the double-bottom antimicrobial packages (DBAP) had 1/3 less fungal growth, less than 50% weight loss and ethylene and CO2 production, and less than 25% firmness loss, TA and SSC increase, and pH decrease compared to controls. The DBAP with ICsa performed better than with ICp in reducing ethylene production, respiration rate, firmness loss, TA increase, and pH decrease. This demonstrates DBAP containing ICp or ICsa can maximize the shelf-life of apples injured by P. expansum, validating a novel type of antimicrobial packaging.

AB Microalgae are a sustainable alternative source of n-3 LC-PUFA that can be incorporated into the food chain either via the incorporation of the (intact or disrupted) biomass or by the incorporation of the oil extracted from the biomass. However, the impact of the dosage form on the enrichment of food products with n-3 LC-PUFA and their oxidative stability has never been described before. This study aims to contribute more insight on the impact of the dosage form of the photoautotrophic microalga Nannochloropsis in enriched tomato puree. Three different dosage forms of Nannochloropsis were compared to commercial fish oil and analyzed for their amount of n-3 LC-PUFA, lipid oxidation products, antioxidants and free fatty acids. Tomato purees supplemented with dosage forms derived from Nannochloropsis showed higher oxidative stability than those supplemented with commercial fish oil. The highest oxidative stability was observed for purees supplemented with Nannochloropsis biomass irrespective of whether it was pre-disrupted.

AB Sugar-based biosurfactants are safer and healthier alternatives to synthetic surfactants especially for use in the food industry. In this work, biosurfactants were synthesized via the esterification of lactose with lauric acid in different organic solvents without using lipase or other enzymes. Commercial aluminosilicate zeolite was used as a catalyst. Conversions of up to 92% were obtained for pure lactose and 38% for raw lactose from whey. Surfaceactive properties including surface tension, interfacial tension, and contact angle were measured. All samples showed surface tensions lower than sodium dodecyl sulfate, SDS (19.59-36.57 mN/m compared to 38.8 mN/m for SDS) and interfacial tensions comparable with it (9.47-12.18 mN/m compared to 4.77 mN/m for SDS). Results showed that aluminosilicate zeolites can be used for the synthesis of lactose esters, which have potential applications as biosurfactants for the food industry featuring low surface and interfacial tensions.

AB A set of measurements have been conducted to determine the activity-level of natural and artificial radionuclides in some baby foods commercialized in Italy. The measurements have been carried out using liquid scintillation, gamma, alpha and mass spectrometry. The activity concentrations ranged from 0.005 to 0.238, from 0.0082 to 1.65, from 0.0003 to 0.015 and from < 13.6 to 233.3 Bq kg(-1) for Po-210, U-238, Th-232 and K-40 a respectively, whereas they are below the detection limit for Cs-137 and Ra-226. The annual effective dose due to intake of Po-210, U-238, Th-232 and K-40 a ranged from 280 and 800 mu Sv y(-1) for infant 1 year old. These values lie well within the typical worldwide range of dose due to the ingestion of all natural radiation reported by UNSCEAR and they are below the internationally recommended level. This indicates that the baby food available in Italy would not pose any significant radiological impact to infant.

AB Macronutrients in whole plant foods are enclosed inside cells. The metabolic response from these entrapped nutrients may depend on cell-wall porosity, by controlling the passage of digestive enzymes. As non-interacting size mimics of digestive enzymes, we investigated the diffusion of fluorescently-labelled probes across the walls of isolated plant cells from potato tuber, red kidney bean and banana. Diffusion properties of permeable probes, dextran (20-kDa and 70-kDa) and albumin, were quantified, using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. The consistent reduction of diffusion rate in the presence of cell walls (around 40%) compared to free-diffusion rate was attributed to the limiting porosity of the wall matrix. A combination of the physical barrier effects demonstrated here and non-catalytic binding of enzymes to cell walls limits the hydrolysis of intracellular macronutrients. This and further understanding of the structural basis for the physical barrier properties would help to design foods from plant materials with enhanced nutrition.

AB The aim of this work was to evaluate the effects of a phenolic extract from olive mill waste water on the stabilization of refined olive oil and on French fry quality during the frying process. Frozen, pre-fried potatoes were fried at 180 degrees C for 8 min in refined olive oil enriched by different concentrations of a phenolic extract, while oil enriched by a common synthetic antioxidant (butylated hydroxytoluene) was used for comparison. The whole frying process took six hours. The phenolic extract has revealed as a very promising oil stabilizing agent during frying, playing an important role (dose-dependent) in preserving the antioxidants both in oil and in food, in reducing the formation of unwanted compounds (acrolein and hexanal), and in contrasting the acrylamide production. These results clearly show that the phenolic extract can be used as a source of natural antioxidants to replace (or avoid) synthetic additives in foods or beverages.

AB Pellino proteins are associated with immune and stress responses through their effects on NF-kappa B signaling and B-cell development, and through their role as a scaffold in TLR/IL-1R signaling pathways. However, their function during embryonic development is unclear. Here, we report the developmental expression patterns and functions of pelt1b, which encodes a zebrafish ortholog of human Pellino1. Maternal peli1b transcripts were present in zebrafish embryos at the 1-cell stage and zygotic transcripts appeared in the shield area at 6 hours post fertilization (hpf), particularly in the neural plate of the dorsal region. peli1b transcripts were concentrated in the somites, lens, myogenic cells, lateral plate mesoderm, and presomitic mesoderm at 12 hpf, but expression shifted to the telencephalon, diencephalon, hindbrain, and rhombomeres (r1-7) at 24 hpf. Distribution of peli1b transcripts was further restricted to the telencephalon, diencephalon, hindbrain, eyes, and pectoral fins at 48 hpf. Knock-down of peli1b with a peli1b antisense morpholino resulted in significant developmental defects and a reduction in size of the telencephalon, diencephalon, rhombomeres (r1-7), and spinal cord at 24 hpf. When peli1b-knock-down embryos were analyzed for zic3, a marker associated with the central nervous system, we found lower levels of zic3 transcripts in the shield area at 6 hpf and in the posterior diencephalon, dorsal neural plate, midbrain, and hindbrain at 14 hpf. Finally, the ERK3/4 inhibitor SB203580 also induced a significant reduction in the level of zic3 transcripts in the neural plate at 6 hpf and in the posterior diencephalon, dorsal neural plate, midbrain, hindbrain, segmental plate, dorsal spinal cord, and dorsal posterior neural plate at 14 hpf. It is thus likely that the association between Peli1b and brain development in zebrafish embryos occurs via ERK3/4 pathways.

AB Alpine plants remain the least studied plant communities in terrestrial ecosystems. However, how they adapt to high-altitude environments is far from clear. Here, we used RNA-seq to investigate a typical alpine plant mace (Lepidium meyenii) to understand its high-altitude adaptation at transcriptional and post-transcriptional level. At transcriptional level, we found that maca root significantly up-regulated plant immunity genes in day-time comparing to night-time, and up-regulated abiotic (cold/osmotic) stress response genes in Nov and Dec comparing to Oct. In addition, 17 positively selected genes were identified, which could be involved in mitochondrion. At post-transcriptional level, we found that maca had species-specific characterized alternative splicing (AS) profile which could be influenced by stress environments. For example, the alternative 3' splice site events (A3SS, 39.62%) were predominate AS events in maca, rather than intron retention (IR, 23.17%). Interestingly, besides serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), a lot of components in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) were identified under differential alternative splicing (DAS), supporting AS coupled to NMD as essential mechanisms for maca's stress responses and high-altitude adaptation. Taken together, we first attempted to unveil maca's high-altitude adaptation mechanisms based on transcriptome and post-transcriptome evidence. Our data provided valuable insights to understand the high-altitude adaptation of alpine plants.

AB Background and aim: Epidemiological studies suggested that ethnic/racial background influences the associations of altered leptin secretion and leptin gene (LEP) polymorphisms with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). We investigated the association between LEP variants and plasma leptin levels with PCOS in Tunisian and Bahraini Arab women.
   Subjects and methods: Retrospective case-control study, involving 255 PCOS cases and 253 control subjects from Bahrain, and 320 women PCOS cases and 447 controls from Tunisia. LEP genotyping was done by allele exclusion on real-time PCR.
   Results: Minor allele frequencies of rs10487506, rs7799039, rs2167270, rs12706832, and rs10954173 LEP variants were not significantly different between PCOS cases and control women among Bahraini and Tunisians, even before applying the Bonferroni correction. Similarly, the genotype distribution of the tested LEP variants was comparable between women with PCOS and control women among Bahraini and Tunisian subjects. None of the tested LEP variants was linked with altered leptin serum concentrations. However, five-locus haplotype analysis identified GGGGG and GAGGG haplotypes to be positively, and haplotype AAGGG to be negatively associated with PCOS in Bahraini women, after adjusting for HOMA-IR. No LEP haplotype associated with PCOS was identified in Tunisians.
   Conclusion: This is the first study to document differential contribution of LEP gene variants with PCOS according to ethnic/racial background of study subjects, highlighting the need for controlling for ethnicity in genetic association studies.

AB Smooth muscle cell (SMC) regeneration plays an important role in retrieving the bladder-wall functionality and it can be achieved by a proper cell-co-polymer constructed by tissue engineering. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), which can be specifically prepared for the patient, was considered as cells in this study, and Poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) as a most interesting polymer in biomedical applications was applied to the scaffold fabrication by electrospinning. After scaffold characterization, SMC differentiation potential of the human iPSCs was investigated while cultured on the PLGA nanofibrous scaffold by evaluation of the SMC related important gene and protein markers. Alpha-smooth muscle actin (ASMA), Smooth muscle 22 alpha (SM-22a) as two early SMC markers were significantly up regulated either two and three weeks after differentiation induction in human iPSCs cultured on PLGA compared to those cells cultured on the tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS). But Calponin-1, Caldesmon1 and myosin heavy chain (MHC) expression differences in human iPSCs cultured on PLGA and TCPS were significant only three weeks after differentiation induction based on its lately expression in the differentiation process. ASMA and MHC proteins were also considered for evaluation by immunocytochemistry on differentiated iPSCs whereas results showed higher expression of these proteins in stem cells grown on PLGA compared to the TCPS. According to the results, human iPSCs demonstrated a great SMC differentiation potential when grown on PLGA and it could be considered as a promising cell-co-polymer for use in bladder tissue engineering.

AB Two full-length cDNAs of the cyclin-D3-1-like gene, named as BnCYCD3-1-like-1 and BnCYCD3-1-like-2 respectively were obtained from Brassica napus, both of which encoded a cell cycle protein CYCD3. Alternative splicing (AS) events of the two genes' transcripts were identified, assigned as BnCYCD3-1-like-1-1, BnCYCD3-1-like-1-2, BnCYCD3-1-like-2-1 and BnCYCD3-1-like-2-2 respectively. BnCYCD3-1-like-1-1 and BnCYCD3-1-like-2-1 were both fully-spliced transcripts which encoded a complete protein containing a LXCXE motif, two cyclin boxes and a PEST domain, while other two alternative splicing transcripts both resulted in the early termination of the protein translation. BnCYCD3-1-like-2-2 retained the third intron, lacking a PEST domain, while BriCYCD3-1-like-1-2 retained all the introns, lacking the C-terminal cyclin domain and a PEST domain. The expression pattern for tissue and development specification of the AS transcripts were investigated. The results showed that the standard splicing transcripts (BrCYCD3-1-like-1-1 and BnCYCD3-1-like-2-3) with complete structural domains were found with the most abundant expression in seeds, followed by leaves, and the least expression in stems. Both of BnCYCD3-1-like-2-1 and BnCYCD3-1-like-2-2 had the highest abundance in leaves, followed by roots. In addition, by applying various biotic and abiotic stresses on Brassica napus, the variations in the expression of each transcript under stress treatment were studied. Also, it was found that AS of the cyclin-D3-1-like gene may play an important role in helping Brassica napus respond to environmental stresses by coordinating the levels of Vanscripts of standard splicing and alternative splicing.

AB The eyestalks of crustaceans play an essential role in controlling a variety of physiological functions by converting light into hormonal signals. To obtain a more complete description of eyestalk biology in the commercially important Chinese mitten crab (Eriocheir sinensis), we conducted comparative transcriptome analysis of eyestalks during the day and at night using high-throughput sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform. We obtained 47,092 unigenes-including 4771 differentially expressed genes (DEGs)-from eyestalks during the day and at night. We found that 4269 DEGs were upregulated during the day and 502 DEGs were upregulated at night. We identified five DEGs that may contribute to molting, including molt-inhibiting hormone, cuticle, catalase, aquaporin, and ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme; hence, similar to other crustaceans, Eriocheir sinensis may molt at night. We further identified eight DEGs related to behavior regulation, including three glutamate dehydrogenase genes that were upregulated during the day. Thus, changes in the eyestalks may partially compensate for daily changes in illumination in the Chinese mitten crab's normal environment. Our present study is the first genome-wide transcriptome analysis of the eyestalks of Eriocheir sinensis during the day and at night. Our findings provide a valuable insight into the molecular basis of circadian cycle regulation in crustaceans.

TI Comparative analysis of two sister Erythrophleum species (Leguminosae)
   reveal contrasting transcriptome-wide responses to early drought stress

AB With the ongoing climate change, African rainforests are expected to experience severe drought events in the future. In Africa, the tropical genus Erythrophleum (Fabaceae) includes two forest sister timber tree species displaying contrasting geographical distributions. Erythrophleum ivorense is adapted to wet evergreen Guineo-Congolian forests, whereas E. suaveolens occurs in a wider range of climates, being found in moist dense forests but also in gallery forests under a relatively drier climate. This geographical distribution pattern suggests that the two species might cope differently to drought at the genomic level. Yet, the genetic basis of tolerance response to drought stress in both species is still uncharacterized. To bridge this gap, we performed an RNA-seq approach on seedlings from each species to monitor their transcriptional responses at different levels of drought stress (0, 2 and 6 weeks after stopping watering seedlings).
   Monitoring of wilting symptoms revealed that E. suaveolens displayed an earlier phenotypic response to drought stress than E. ivorense. At the transcriptomic level, results revealed 2020 (1204 down-regulated/816 up-regulated) and 1495 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in response to drought stress from a total of 67,432 and 66,605 contigs assembled in E. ivorense and E. suaveolens, respectively. After identifying 30,374 orthologs between species, we found that only 7 of them were DEGs shared between species, while 587 and 458 were differentially expressed only in E. ivorense or E. suaveolens, respectively. GO and KEGG enrichment analysis revealed that the two species differ in terms of significantly regulated pathways as well as the number and expression profile of DEGs (Up/Down) associated with each pathway in the two stress stages. Our results suggested that the two studied species react differently to drought. E. suaveolens seems displaying a prompt response to drought at its early stage strengthened by the down-regulation of many DEGs encoding for signaling and metabolism-related pathways. A considerable up-regulation of these pathways was also found in E. ivorense at the late stage of drought, suggesting this species may be a late responder. Overall, our data may serve as basis for further understanding the genetic control of drought tolerance in tropical trees and favor the selection of crucial genes for genetically enhancing drought resistance.
