AB To improve the interfacial properties between carbon fiber (CF) and epoxy resin (EP), T300 carbon fibers were coated with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) using aqueous suspension deposition method. The carbon fiber/epoxy laminated composites were prepared by molding process. The wettability and interfacial properties between MWCNTs deposited carbon fibers (MWCNTs-T300) and EP were studied. The mechanical properties of carbon fiber/epoxy laminated composites were tested, and the mechanism of the interface strengthening was discussed. The results show that the surface energy of T300 carbon fiber is obviously increased after MWCNT deposition. The contact angle between MWCNTs-T300 and EP is reduced, and the interfacial energy and adhesion work are greatly improved. The MWCNTs-T300/EP laminated composites have excellent mechanical properties, the flexural strength is 822 MPa, the tensile strength is 841 MPa, and the interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) is 25.68 MPa, which are increased by 15.1%, 17.6% and 12.6% compared with those of the original carbon fiber/EP laminated composites (original T300/EP) respectively. The MWCNTs-T300/EP composites have good interface bonding performance, low porosity and uniform fiber distribution. Interfacial friction and resin toughening are the main mechanisms for the interface enhancement of MWCNTs-T300/EP composites. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Fe atoms were deposited on Si( 1 1 1)-7 x 7 restructured surface, which had been covered by CH3OH molecules. A newly formed surface is stabilized by a quasi-potential made by breaking, and adsorbed atoms or molecules can be stabilized by forming "quasi-compounds". Then, aim to greatly enhance the magnetic properties of the memory units, nitriding experiments were implemented on the existing Fe compounds. With the in-situ observation of STM, a series of Fe3N structures make up the newly emerged iron-nitride compounds, showing good linear characteristics. By adjusting the concentration, this study further explored its formation process and compounds models. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The quantum second virial coefficient B-q has been used as a tool to quantify the average magnitude and sign of interactions between T down arrow atoms. A negative B-q represents an overall attractive interaction. It is found that B-q of dilute gas is related to formation of small clusters. A very negative B-q indicates that interactions would be expected to be strongly attractive and predicts aggregation atoms to form clusters. It is concluded that B-q may be used as a predictor of formation of small spin-polarized tritium (T down arrow) clusters. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Calcium intercalation underneath epitaxial graphene on 6H-SiC(0001) were investigated by scanning tunneling microcopy (STM) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. After the preparation of calcium-adsorbed graphene on 6H-SiC(0001), annealing the sample to 900 degrees C activated the intercalation of the adsorbed calcium into buffer layer (BL), monolayer (1L) and bilayer epitaxial (2L) graphene. Subsequent DFT modeling show the dependence of the most stable intercalation sites for calcium underneath BL, 1L and 2L graphene on the intercalation density. Further DFT calculations indicate charge transfer from the intercalant into graphene layers, leading to the n-type doping of the calcium-intercalated BL, 1L and 2L graphene.

AB A molecular dynamics simulation is performed to investigate the icosahedron in Mg70Zn30 metallic glass during solidification at the cooling rate of 1 x 10(13) K/s. It is found that the 1551, 1541 and 1431 bondtypes are closely related to 13-atom icosahedron-like clusters. Two kinds of clusters are very similar to full icosahedron in geometry. The three clusters can transform into each other by changing one bond between a pair of outer atoms. One distorted icosahedron act as the intermediate between the two others. This work provides an insight into the glass formation in alloy from the cluster-level structural viewpoint and will shed light on developing more metallic glasses. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

It is demonstrated that the DACDC molecule may form four peptide bonds with natural amino acids such as alanine and, as a consequence, two peptide chains might be connected to each other by the DACDC unit which in turn reveals the ability of DACDC to act as a new type of peptide linker-peptide clasp.

AB We investigate the interplay effects of internal friction and solvent quality on the contact formation dynamics based on non-Markovian diffusion equation supplemented with an exponential sink term accounting for the electron transfer quenching. The mean contact formation time has been derived under Wilemski-Fixman approximation. We show that internal friction induces fractional viscosity dependence of looping time, which will be affected remarkably by solvent quality condition. Besides, internal friction promotes a diffusion-limited mechanism by slowing chain relaxation, while solvent quality being another key factor shifts the critical internal friction for the crossover of the transition from reaction to diffusion-limited regimes.

AB We investigated the effect of superhydrophobic walls on electrokinetics phenomena in a finite-length microchannel with superhydrophobic walls (in both transient and steady-state). We implemented the effect of superhydrophobicity using Naviers slip-length. To include the importance of the electric double-layer, we scaled the slip-length with respect to Debye-length (kappa(-1)). By increasing the slip-length from 0 to 144 nm (1.5 kappa(-1)), streaming-current, streaming-potential, flow-rate and electrokinetic energy conversion increased by 2.55, 2.44, 1.8, and 3.4 folds, accordingly. The electrokinetic energy conversion of each microchannel was in the order of picowatt. To produce more energy, an array of microchannels should be used. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Stretchable hydrogen sensors were fabricated from Pd nanosheets that were transferred onto a PDMS substrate. To prepare the Pd nanosheets, a Pd thin film on PDMS was first biaxially stretched and then PDMS substrate was etched off. The size of Pd nanosheets decreased as the applied strain increased and the film thickness decreased. A transfer technique was utilized to implement the stretchable hydrogen sensors. The stretchable sensors exhibited negative response behaviors upon the exposure to hydrogen gas. Interestingly, the sensors worked even under large strains up to 30%, demonstrating a potential as a high-strain-tolerable hydrogen sensor for the first time. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Contrasting the EPR simulation with the experimental measurements evidenced that, upon propene oxidation, the Ag-(b)(2+) species transform into two clusters each containing 2 Ag-(b)(2+) and 1 Ag+ species. This cluster is composed of two parallel electron spins (dimer) and three nuclear spins (trimer). Such a result led us to suggest that initially, Ag-(b)(2+) species clusters were formed by three parallel electron spins. The ferromagnetic character of Ag-(b)(2+) species may explain their catalytic performance towards total oxidation of propylene. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Using the transition state (TS) theory, the anharmonic and harmonic rate constant are calculated by means of Yao and Lin method for the main reactions related to nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in fuel combustion processes, respectively. A junction occurs between the anharmonic and harmonic rate constant for some bimolecular reactions, and the anharmonic rate constant is higher than the harmonic rate constant at low temperature, normally. The anharmonic effect of those reactions is significant and can't be neglected at high temperature. Moreover, the modification of the existing reaction mechanisms referring to NO2 in fuel combustion processes is achieved through rate constant. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Unique technical challenges and their solutions for implementing semi-numerical Hartree-Fock exchange on the Phil Processor are discussed, especially concerning the single-instruction-multiple-data type of processing and small cache size. Benchmark calculations on a series of buckyball molecules with various Gaussian basis sets on a Phi processor and a six-core CPU show that the Phi processor provides as much as 12 times of speedup with large basis sets compared with the conventional four-center electron repulsion integration approach performed on the CPU. The accuracy of the semi-numerical scheme is also evaluated and found to be comparable to that of the resolution-of-identity approach. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB We have examined the transmission of soft X-ray pulses from the FERMI free electron laser through carbon films of varying thickness, quantifying nonlinear effects of pulses above and below the carbon K-edge. At typical of soft X-ray free electron laser intensities, pulses exhibit linear absorption at photon energies above and below the K-edge, similar to 308 and similar to 260 eV, respectively; whereas two-photon absorption becomes significant slightly below the K-edge, similar to 284.2 eV. The measured two-photon absorption cross section at 284.18 eV (similar to 6 x 10(-48) cm(4) s) is 7 orders of magnitude above what is expected from a simple theory based on hydrogen-like atoms - a result of resonance effects.

AB The aim of this study was a comparison between PO4-3-P removal from sewage using zeolite as support medium in subsurface flow treatment wetlands (SSF TWs) operated with different oxidation-reduction potentials (ORPs). In addition, the zeolite's phosphate adsorption characteristics were evaluated. For this, Two mesocosm SSF TWs were installed and operated during 504 d for the PO4-3-P adsorption from sewage: a) mesocosm SSF TW with natural zeolite (MTW-Z1) and b) mesocosm SSF TW with gravel (MTW-G1). Two ORPs was used in MTW-Z1 and MTW-G1: a) ORP-A, ORP > +50 mV, b) ORP-B, ORP < -50 mV. Furthermore, the adsorption characteristics were evaluated in batch assays (zeolite amount and particle size were studied) with different PO4-3-P initial concentrations. Regarding the mesocosm SSF TWs evaluation, the PO4-3-P removed from sewage by MTW-Z1 is between 20% and 50% significantly (p < 0.05) higher than the MTW-G1. At the same time, ORP-A, above + 50 mV, significantly improves (p < 0.05), by 10% more, the PO4-3-P removal capacity from sewage. Regarding adsorption characteristics, maximum adsorption capacity determined by Langmuir kinetic was 0.03 mg PO4-3-P g(-1) for initial concentrations of 10-15 mg PO4-3-P L-1. In the case of MTW-Z1 with ORPs A (> + 50 mV) and B (< - 50 mV), the zeolite maximum adsorption capacity was 0.3 mg PO4-3-P g(-1). Therefore, the potential maximum adsorption capacity of natural zeolite used as a medium in SSF TWs with ORP conditions below -50 mV and above +50 mV can be increased until 10-fold regarding Langmuir adsorption kinetic.

AB Management and reclamation of industrial mine sites for carbon (C) sequestration is an emerging technique for offsetting anthropogenic C emissions. Land application of municipal biosolids is an effective method for amending closed tailings storage facilities and providing the nutrients to establish a vegetative cover. Biosolids applications can influence the C sequestration potential of tailings and other mine wastes at the onset of reclamation by initiating soil development processes and enhancing primary productivity, thereby leading to increased accumulation of soil organic carbon (SOC) over time. The short term ecological benefits of biosolids applications are well understood, but the long-term (> 10 years) effects of biosolids on reclaimed mine soils are under-researched. The objective of this long-term study was to determine the effects of biosolids applied in 1998 at increasing rates (0, 150 and 250 dry Mg ha(-1)) on the C sequestration potential of a copper and molybdenum mine tailings site in the southern interior of British Columbia, Canada that is currently undergoing reclamation to a pasture-based ecosystem. We assessed changes in C pools, plant productivity and select soil physiochemical parameters at an established research site at the Bethlehem Tailings Storage Facility over a 13-year period spanning from 1998 to 2011. Tailings total C and N concentrations increased with time and were highest when biosolids were applied at 250 Mg ha(-1). Carbon pools increased with increasing biosolids application and ranged from 23 to 155 Mg C ha(-1) after 13 years of reclamation. The net SOC sequestration rates (i.e. the C sequestration potential) ranged from 0.72 to 6.3 Mg C ha (-1) yr (-1) and were highest at the 250 Mg ha(-1) application rate. The C storage efficiency was higher in the 150 Mg ha(-1) treatment (0.74 Mg C stored per Mg of biosolids applied), indicating that lower application rates of biosolids are more efficient at storing C than higher application rates. Aboveground plant biomass was substantially higher on biosolid-amended tailings (6 and 6.7 Mg ha(-1) for B150 and B250, respectively) compared to the unamended tailings (0.39 Mg ha(-1)), which suggests that the increase in C pools was a direct result of organic matter inputs from enhanced plant productivity. The tailings were naturally high in Cu and Mo, and when amended with biosolids at a rate of 250 Mg ha(-1), elevated levels of Zn (as compared to federal soil quality guidelines) were detected. The unamended tailings increased in alkalinity with time, whereas the pH of the biosolid-amended tailings remained stable around neutral. This study demonstrated that a single application of biosolids can facilitate plant production and the accumulation of SOC on mine tailings for more than a decade, and supports the use of biosolids for promoting long- term C sequestration on reclaimed mine sites in similar environments.

AB As an aggressive invasive saltmarsh plant in many places worldwide, Spartina alterniflora has a wide distribution range in latitude. Previous studies have explored latitudinal trends in S. alterniflora productivity in its native regions using meta- analysis, whereas to the best of our knowledge, that in China as its largest invaded regions have not been reported. In this study, we performed meta-analysis to explore latitudinal trends in productivity as measured by the end-of-season-live (EOSL) biomass of S. alterniflora along a broad latitudinal gradient from 24 degrees N to 34 degrees N on the coast of China. The results showed that in stark contrast to the linear decreasing trend found along the East Coast of North America as its native region, the latitudinal variation of the consolidated EOSL biomass along the coast of China exhibited an erratic "W"-shape and fell within the range of variation of the surveyed biomass reported in the literature. Additionally, the EOSL biomass was not correlated with climatic factors, such as the mean annual temperature and mean annual growing degree-days. The results of this study complement the ever-growing literature of S. alterniflora in China from a consolidated perspective and indicate that the response of S. alterniflora productivity to climate change could be more complicated in invaded regions.

TI Mosses inhibit germination of vascular plants on an extensive green roof

AB Mosses are capable of tolerating harsh conditions, and are commonly found on both conventional bare roofs and engineered green roofs. Intentional planting of mosses on green roofs has shown that mosses can improve ecosystem services such as stormwater retention and microclimate cooling. Past studies of moss interactions with vascular plants on green roofs and in other habitats demonstrate both positive and negative effects on juvenile and adult tracheophytes. Moss can aid vascular plants by buffering environmental extremes, facilitating seed establishment, and improving nutrient and water availability. Conversely, moss can also hinder young seedling germination by blocking access to the soil column and/or light. In the green roof context, few studies have examined the relationship between moss and vascular plant germination. Since mosses commonly colonize green roofs it is important to understand the effects of established moss colonies on incoming plant propagules. The purpose of this study was to examine how four moss species, Atrichum undulatum (Hedw.) P. Beauv., Polytrichum commune Hedw., Polytrichum piliferum Hedw., and Racomitrium lanuginosum (Hedw.) Brid. affected the germination of weedy and native vascular plant seeds in a green roof system. Seeds were added to six pre-established moss treatments: monocultures of each moss species, a mixture which included all four moss species, and a substrate only control in pots on a rooftop. Overall, the control (moss-free) treatment resulted the highest germination rates for the majority of seeded species examined, an indication that for these vascular plants, mosses tend to inhibit germination of incoming seeds.

AB In seasonal freeze-thaw zones of NE China, the policy-oriented land management has caused successive land use conversions of native woodland, dry cropland and paddy field for food security. Controls of soil property factors on soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC) dynamics might vary with deforestation. This study aimed to test performance of soil properties interpreting DOC variability along soil profile following a vegetation succession of native forest, rainfed crops (maize-soybean rotations) and paddy rice in an observation area of the Sanjiang Plain. The linear mixed effects model evaluated relative importance of soil properties with comparisons of adjusting and not adjusting for random effects of land use and soil depth as subject variables. The modeling results revealed presence of consistent soil property factors indicating DOC dynamics before and after deforestation. When excluding interferences of land uses and soil layers, interpretations of soil properties were weakened. Soil moisture and bulk density predominantly accounted for DOC variability across land uses, presenting greater estimated effects (0.69 and -0.64, respectively) over those of total nitrogen, soil organic carbon and hydrolyzable nitrogen (0.49, 0.44 and 0.31, respectively). But no soil property factor indicated DOC variability with soil depth. Further research is needed to understand why indications of soil moisture and bulk density on DOC dynamics would differ between horizontal and vertical.

AB The study gives a new method for contaminants removal from domestic wastewater using a novel design of Multi-Soil-Layering (MSL) eco-technology. Two MSL reactors were built and operated under laboratory conditions: a standard and modified MSL design (S-MSL and M-MSL). A tracer test using KCl indicated varying degrees of dispersion, short-circuiting, dead space, effective volume ratio and hydraulic efficiency in two MSL reactors. The new MSL design was found to be most effective in improving hydrodynamic flow conditions. The M-MSL reactor increased the mean HRT from 15.79 to 22.07 h, and decreased the dead space rate from 38% to 8%. The early arrival of the distribution peak, indicator of short-circuiting, was mainly noted in the case of S-MSL RTD which is around 57% of the nominal HRT. A high dead space rate was found to occur in the S-MSL reactor, and produced a poor hydraulic performance. The large difference between the nominal and mean HRT confirms the presence of zones of stagnation in the S-MSL system. The new MSL design increased the effective volume ratio from 0.62 to 0.92. The hydraulic efficiency was increased from 0.26 to 0.84 and reached a good level (lambda. >= 0.75) highlighting the excellent hydraulic performance of the M-MSL design. Obtained results revealed that M-MSL had an optimal hydraulic profile and enhanced sanitary and physicochemical performances compared to S-MSL. The mean log reduction of total coliforms, fecal coliforms and fecal streptococci was increased from 1.25, 1.26 and 1.15 log units for the S-MSL to 2.36, 2.38 and 2.11 log units for the M-MSL reactor. Both MSL reactors achieved high and satisfactory TSS and organics removal. The M-MSL reactor accomplished a 92% removal of TN, while the S-MSL achieved a slightly less effective result. The M-MSL reactor was also found to be more efficient in reducing TP by 98% compared to a removal rate of 76% in the S-MSL reactor. Therefore, the new design of MSL eco-technology could be adopted as an alternative to the current design for efficient domestic wastewater treatment.

AB Peatland-based treatment wetlands that purify incoming water by means of natural physical, chemical and biological processes belonging to the peatland ecosystem are widely used at Finnish peat extraction sites. They can comprise either undrained or drained overland flow areas (OFAs or DOFAs), with the OFAs representing the best available technology (BAT) for peat extraction. We analyse here the long-term treatment performance of these OFAs and DOFAs and factors affecting this performance. Data on 14 OFAs and DOFAs in different parts of Finland were taken from the extensive long-term environmental pollution control databases. Nearly half of these wetlands had been monitored for at least 4 years and seven for 8-23 years. The results indicated that peatland-based treatment wetlands purify drainage water as efficiently as other natural treatment wetlands on soils in general, the common challenge being phosphorus retention. Iron was also efficiently retained. The average reductions were highest in OFAs with good hydraulic function, and these also showed long-term water protection performance. An important factor affecting purification efficiency was the hydraulic loading rate. Important system design elements in this regard were the size of the wetland in relation to its catchment area, its gradient, the length of the water flow route within the wetland, and the efficient flow area of the wetland. The results regarding the latter two design elements strongly indicate that not all the areas potentially suitable in DOFAs for water purification are yet being used efficiently.

AB Urban stormwater is an increasing environmental problem for cities worldwide. Many cities have turned to green infrastructure solutions, which provide water treatment and retention while also harnessing other ecosystem services. This study considered the design of detention ponds and treatment wetlands with the goal of improving hydraulic performance (specifically reducing short-circuiting) while also increasing habitat diversity. Fifty-four basin topographies, including a variety of islands and berms, were compared to an open and a traditional serpentine basin. Using scaled physical models the hydraulic performance of each design was evaluated using tracer studies to construct the residence time distribution and to visually observe the circulation pattern. In addition, the earthwork construction cost and habitat diversity index (based on the Shannon-Weaver entropy measure) were estimated at field scale. The results reveal multiple design options that improve hydraulic performance, relative to both the open and serpentine basins, and which represent a range of habit diversity and cost. General guidelines for optimal configurations are discussed.

AB Comprehensive approaches integrating ecological and socio-economic objectives are fundamental pillars in the design of more sustainable agroecosystems. To this purpose, we formulated an optimization model aimed to support decisions behind the planning of agricultural ecosystems. We demonstrate the proposed approach onto the design agroecosystems aimed at the regeneration of deforested lands in the Peruvian Amazon to investigate how the different objectives influence the species composition and the overall sustainability performance. The model incorporates the three dimensions of sustainability into the optimization objectives, i.e., annual income (economic dimension), species diversity (environmental dimension), and income stability (social dimension). The obtained results show, firstly, relevant tradeoffs between the economic objective and the social and ecological ones, with significant reductions in short term incomes in the agroecosystems with the highest levels of diversity. Secondly, the species compositions changes over time depending on the life cycle of selected species and following ecological succession paths. Finally, species diversity also determines heterogeneous ecological structures, and these are jointly good premises for ecosystem multi-functionality. We highlighted major methodological challenges for the planning of more sustainable agroecosystems, which are mainly linked to the conflict and trade-off analysis, long-term assessment, non steady-state solutions, and lack of data. Despite these challenges, the formulated optimization framework can quantitatively support the understanding and the pursuing of both the ecological conservation and the productivity of agroecosystems, and put the basis for future more detailed models.

AB Although two-dimensional (2D) tin selenides are attracting intense attentions, studies on its phase transition are still relatively few. Here we report a facile way to control the phase growth of tin selenide flakes on mica and SiO2/Si by only adjusting nominal Sn: Se ratio, which refers to the amount of loaded SnO2 and Se precursors. High normal Sn: Se ratio induced SnSe flakes, conversely SnSe2 flakes formed. It could be used as a practical guide to selectively synthesize pure phase of single crystalline 2D layered chalco-genide materials similar to tin selenides. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB When density is varied at a constant temperature just above the gas-liquid critical temperature, the system is found to exhibit large scale density fluctuations which are often rationalized in terms of crossing of a Widom line. We use the discrete variable representation (DVR) scheme to construct the spectroscopic maps for transition frequencies and transition dipoles, and obtain the infrared spectrum of the O-H stretch in the said temperature-density region of the phase diagram. The infrared lineshape shows a crossover from Lorentzian to Gaussian as we approach the Widom line. The width of the lineshape displays a pronounced maximum. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Metal nanoparticle aggregate is an exciting platform for manipulating light-matter interactions at the nanoscale, thanks to the optically driven free electrons couple electrically across the inter-particle gap region. We use time dependent density functional theory calculations to investigate the optical response modulations in planar square-shaped aluminum nanoparticles array via morphology deformation (varying the inter-particle gap distance in the range of 2-20 angstrom) separately along one and two directions. We report the surprising observation that irrespective of the different morphology deformations, there exists a unique inter-particle gap distance of 12 angstrom for which, a maximum optical field enhancement can be achieved. We remark that plasmonic interaction between metal nanoparticles in an aggregate is controlled to a large extent by the size of the inter-particle gap distance. We believe that our quantum mechanical calculations will inspire and contribute to the design, control, and exploitation of aluminum based plasmonic devices. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The obtained hierarchical porous carbon materials (HPCs) with a large specific surface area and uniform macropore distribution provide abundant active sites and sufficient ion migration channels. When used as an electrode material for supercapacitors, the HPCs exhibit a high specific capacitance of 341.0 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1), excellent rate capability with a capacitance retention of 55.6% at 50 A g(-1) (189.5 F g(-1)), and outstanding cycling performance in the three-electrode system.

AB A new organic-inorganic hybrid with the formula (NH3C3H6CO2H)(2)CdCl4 has been crystallized and investigated by X-ray diffraction. Structural investigations highlight a first-order reversible structural phase transition occurring within the range (290-370 K) between a chiral (phase II) and non-centrosymmetric (Phase I) crystal packing. This strong structural reorganization is the result of conformational changes in the organic chains accompanied by a decrease in octahedral distortion. The accurate crystallographic analysis illustrates the crucial role of organic moieties. The experimental energy gap value (3.65 eV) is in good agreement with the theoretical value obtained by density functional theory. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Methylammonium lead bromide (CH3NH3PbBr3) nanocrystals have great potentials for lighting and display applications. Previously we synthesized CH3NH3PbBr3 nanocrystals using oleylamine as capping molecule and found that by increasing the oleylamine to CH3NH3PbBr3 perovskite ratio (OPR), the photoluminescence wavelengths and morphology of CH3NH3PbBr3 nanocrystals could be varied from 530 nm (green) platelets to 460 nm (blue) particles. Here we modified the synthesis to direct injection of precursors into toluene and found that increasing OPR not only changes the wavelength and morphology of nanocrystals but also the size of the unit cells.

AB A newly discovered nanometer material-mediated piezoelectrochemical (PZEC) for the direct conversion of mechanical energy to chemical energy has attracted increasing attention, for its great potential to be a green dye water decomposition technique. However, it is far from being a cost-effective and practical technique because only ultrasonic can be scavenged to decomposed organic pollutant in previous studies. Here, we prepared 0.5Ba(Zr0.2Ti0.8)O-3-0.5(Ba0.7Ca0.3)TiO3 (BZT-BCT) piezoelectric fibers for the degradation of dye solution via slow stirring and studied the degradation mechanism. It provides a practical, green and low-cost method for decomposing organic dye by scavenging waste mechanical energy from the surrounding environment. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The paper describes modification of carbon nanotubes surface by attaching the grains of Ni-P, Ni-B, Co-B and Fe-B. The modification was obtained by electroless metallization using sodium hypophosphite (NaH2PO2). We have investigated the parameters of electroless metallization process of CNTs. The uniformity of the coating on the carbon nanotubes was related to proper surface activation. While optimizing the electroless deposition, a range of catalyst concentrations from 0.1 to 1.0 gPd/l were tested. Deposition was used to improve the electrical properties of the later composite materials CNT-Ni-P/epoxy. The best results of electroless deposition were obtained for Ni-P and Ni-B coatings.

It is found that the optical gain and the emission wavelength of the GaSb-based QW and QWRs lasers would be considerably greater than that of the GaAs-based QW lasers and QWRs for the same QW-, QWR-width, Bi-content and carrier density. The theoretical results were found to be in good agreement with available experimental data, especially for the emission wavelength given by GaSb-based QW laser diodes. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Bi2WO6 and Bi2WO6/graphene thin films were fabricated by spin coating and post annealing at 600 degrees C for 2 h. In four different thin film samples, the graphene concentration was controlled as 0, 2, 4 and 6 wt%, respectively. The morphology, grain size and elemental distribution of the thin films were characterized by SEM and TEM. The crystallization and crystal phases were determined by XRD patterns, and the existence of graphene in Bi2WO6/graphene composite thin films were confirmed by Raman spectra. The photocatalytic performance of Bi2WO6 and Bi2WO6/graphene thin films was investigated by oxidizing NO under visible light irradiation. The results showed that Bi2WO6/graphene with 4 wt% of graphene showed the highest photocatalytic performance among all samples. This could be attributed to the increased electron conductivity with the presence of graphene. However, a further increased graphene concentration resulted in a decreased photocatalytic performance.

AB Methanimine reaction with O-2 on singlet and triplet potential energy surfaces are investigated using B3PW91, M06-2X, MP2 and CCSD(T) methods. Thermodynamic and kinetic parameters are calculated at M06-2X method. The most favorable channel involves H-abstraction of CH2NH+O-2 to the formation of HCN + H2O2 products via low level energy barrier. The catalytic effect of water molecule on HCN + H2O2 products pathway are investigated. Result shows that contribution of water molecule using complex formation with methanimine can decreases barrier energy of transition state and the reaction rate increases. Also, substituent effect of fluorine atom as deactivating group are investigated on the main reaction pathway. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The 129 local minima of the alanine tetrapeptide with relative energy < 10 kcal/mol were identified at the xB97X-D/6-311++ G(d, p) level of theory from initial structures generated by combining nine local minima of each residue. The CCSD(T), MP2, and dispersion-corrected DFT levels of theory with various basis sets were assessed for relative energies of the 24 representative conformations. The best performance was obtained at the double-hybrid DSD-PBEP86-D3BJ/def2-QZVP level of theory with RMSD = 0.12 kca l/mol against the CCSD(T)/CBS-limit energies. The xB97X-D/def2-QZVP and CAM-B3LYP-D3BJ/def2QZVP levels of theory can be an alternative level of theory with marginal deviations for conformational study of peptides. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Hund's multiplicity rule invariably holds for the ground configurations of few-electron atoms as well as those of multi-electron quantum dots. However, the ordering of the corresponding interelectronic repulsions exhibits a reversal in the former but not in the latter system, upon varying the system parameters. Here, we investigate the transition between these two types of behaviour by studying few-electron atoms confined in spherical cavities. "Counter-intuitive" ordering of the interelectronic repulsions is confirmed when the nuclear charge is low enough and the cavity radius is large enough. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Semi flexible polymer chain has been modeled by choosing various values of persistent length (stiffness). As the polymer chain stiffness increases, the shape of polymer chain changes from globule to extended cigar to toroid like structure during cooling from a high temperature. The aggregation of fullerene nano-particles is found to depend on the morphology of polymer chain. To maximize, the number of polymer bead-nanoparticle contacts, all nano-particle have positioned inside the polymer globule. To minimize, the energy penalty, due to bending of the polymer chain, all nano-particle have positioned on the surface of the polymer's cigar and toroid morphology. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB The electronic properties of borophene nanotube (BNT) are witnessed and the adsorption properties of dimethyl amine (DMA) and trimethyl amine (TMA) molecules on borophene nanotube are explored through non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) and density functional theory (DFT) method. The device density of states spectrum interprets the change in peak maxima, thus indicating the electron transition between DMA, TMA molecules and BNT base material. I-V characteristics strengthen the adsorption property of DMA and TMA on BNT by pointing out the variation in the current. The present work assures that borophene nanotube (BNT) can be employed as DMA and TMA sensor. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A novel orthorhombic oI16 structure, formed by strong covalent sp(2)-sp(3) B-C and B-O bonds, was identified as to be the thermodynamic ground-state phase for B2CO compound by using an unbiased structure searching method. The energy of this new oI16 phase is considerably lower than all those of previously proposed candidates, and it is dynamically stable at atmosphere pressure through the phonon calculations. The evidences of the indirect semiconducting and chemical bonding nature are manifested by the electronic structure calculations and AIM analyses. The pronounced elastic anisotropy of oI16 structure has been revealed by the calculated distributions of elastic moduli along different crystal orientations. The calculated stress-strain relations of oI16 structure disclose its common hard nature but with an extended ductility. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB To seek effective thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules, we have designed compounds 1-4 by introducing substituents on the para-position of boron atom of blue TADF molecule (DABNA-1). The results indicate that 1-4 not only retain the blue emission from 454 to 466 nm, but also possess larger oscillator strength. Besides, the fluorescence radiative rates (k(r)) of 1-4 are higher than that of DABNA-1. The singlet-triplet energy splitting (Delta E-ST) values of designed compounds are smaller than that of DABNA-1. Taking both Delta E-ST and kr into account, designed compounds show better TADF performances, indicating their potential as TADF materials. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The liquid structures of undercooled Zr90Nb10, Zr70Nb30 and Zr50Nb50 alloys were studied by molecular dynamics simulation combined with electrostatic levitation experiments. The densities of three alloys were measured by electrostatic levitation to modify the Zr-Nb potential functions by adjusting parameters in potential functions. In simulation, the atomic packing in Zr-Nb alloys was more ordered at lower temperatures. The Voronoi tessellation analyses indicated Nb-centered clusters were easier to form than Zr-centered clusters although the Nb content was less than 50%. The partial pair distribution functions showed that the interactions among Zr atoms are quite different to that among Nb atoms. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Structural analyses indicate that the spongy-CFO (approximately, 2.96 nm) is nano-structured, spherical, uniformly-distributed, cubic-structured and porous. Field emission studies reveal that CFO exhibit low turn-on field (4.27 V/mu m) and high emission current-density (775 mu A/cm(2)) at a lower applied electric field of 6.80 V/mu m. In addition, extremely good emission current stability is obtained at a pre-set value of 1 mu A and high emission spot-density over large area (2 x 2 cm(2)) suggesting the applicability of these materials for practical applications in vacuum micro-/nano-electronics.

AB Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) provides a radically different HIV prevention option for women. Not only is PrEP the first discrete, woman-controlled method that is taken in advance of exposure, but it is both safe and highly effective, offering over 90% protection if taken daily. While multiple modalities of PrEP are in development ranging from vaginal rings to injectables and implants, only PrEP with oral tenofovir/emtricitabine is currently FDA approved. Family planning clinics provide key access points for many women to learn about and obtain PrEP. By incorporating PrEP services into family planning care, family planning providers have the opportunity to meet women's expectations, ensure women are aware of and offered comprehensive HIV prevention options, and reverse emerging disparities in PrEP access. Despite real and perceived barriers to integrating PrEP into family planning care, providing PrEP services, ranging from education to onsite provision, is not only possible but an important component of providing high-quality sexual and reproductive healthcare to women. Lessons learned from early adopters will help guide those in family planning settings initiating or enhancing PrEP services (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Objective: To examine the motivations and circumstances of individuals seeking information about self-abortion on the Internet.
   Study design: We identified 26 terms that we anticipated someone might use to find information about self-abortion on the internet. Users who entered these terms into the Google search engine were provided with a link to our survey via Google AdWords. We fielded the survey over a 32-day period; users were eligible if accessing the survey from a US-based device. We examined demographic characteristics of the sample, reasons for searching for information on self-abortion, knowledge of the legality of abortion and of nearby providers, and top performing keywords.
   Results: Our Google AdWords campaign containing the survey link was shown approximately 210,000 times, and clicked 9,800 times; 1,235 respondents completed the survey. The vast majority of the sample was female (96%), and 41% were minors. Almost three-quarters (73%) indicated that they were searching for information because they were pregnant and did not or may not want to be. Eleven percent had ever attempted to self-abort. One-third of respondents did not know if abortion was legal in their state of residence, and knowledge of legality did not differ by age.
   Conclusions: There is interest in learning more about self-abortion on the Internet. Our findings suggest that, among those who participated in our survey, online searches for information on self-abortion may be driven by adolescents and young adults facing an unintended pregnancy.
   Implications: Young women, in particular, may have an unmet need for information about safe and accessible abortion options. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB The current study investigated the therapeutic effect of berberine (BBR), an alkaloid derivative against IL-21/IL-21R mediated phosphotidyl inositol 3 kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt) signaling in adjuvant induced arthritic fibroblast-like synoviocytes (AA-FLS) isolated from rats and IL-21 mediated osteoclastogenesis in bone-marrow derived monocytes (BMMs). BBR (15-45 mu M) treatment attenuated the gene and protein levels of IL-21R complex. BBR suppressed the levels of IL-21 (20 ng/ml) mediated production of inflammatory cytokines such as: tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and interleukin 23 (IL-23) in AA-FLS cells. Subsequently, BBR ameliorated the gene and protein expression levels of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), IL-23 and nuclear factor kappa B (NF kappa B) p65 through the inhibition of PI3K and upregulation of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) at the protein level. Furthermore, BBR also inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt and NF kappa B p65 in a dose dependant manner. LY294002 (20 mu M) treatment suppressed the PI3K/Akt signaling and its downstream elements in AA-FLS cells. BBR also modulated IL-21 mediated osteoclastogenesis through the suppression of PI3K dependant nuclear factor of activated T-cells 1 (Nfatcl) induction. Moreover, BBR controlled the osteoclast differentiation via inhibition of various bone resorptive enzymes including: cathepsin K, matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) and tartarate acid phosphatase (TRAP). LY294002 also inhibited osteoclast formation via suppression of PI3K mediated Nfatcl induction and other downstream elements. Overall, our findings suggest that BBR is a potential candidate for therapeutic targeting of IL-21/IL-21R mediated RA pathogenesis.

AB Recent evidence indicates that nonprofessional immune cells such as epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and fi-broblasts also contribute to innate immunity via secretion of cytokines. Fibroblasts are the principal type of cell found in the periodontal connective tissues and they are involved in the immune response during periodontal disease. The role of fibroblasts in the recognition of pathogens via Toll-like receptors (TLRs) has been established ; however, few studies have been conducted concerning the involvement of innate immune receptors in the recognition of Candida albicans by gingival fibroblast. In the current study, we investigate the functional activity of TLR2, cluster of differentiation 14 (CD14), and myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) molecules in the recognition of C. albicans by gingival fibroblast. First, we identified that gingival fibroblasts expressed TLR2, TLR3, and TLR4. Our results showed that TLR agonists had no effect on these receptors' expression by TLR2, MyD88, and CD14-deficient cells. Notably, C. albicans and a synthetic triacylated lipoprotein (Pam3CSK4) induced a remarkable increase of TLR3 expression on MyD88-deficient gingival fibroblasts. TLR4 expression levels were lower than TLR2 and TLR3 levels and remained unchanged after TLR agonist stimulation. Gingival fibroblasts presented morphological similarities; however, TLR2 deficiency on these cells leads to a lower proliferative response, whereas the deficiency on CD14 expression resulted in lower levels of type I collagen by these cells. In addition, the recognition of C. albicans by gingival fibroblasts had an effect on the secretion of cytokines and it was dependent on a specific recognition molecule. Specifically, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) production after the recognition of C. albicans was dependent on MyD88, CD14, and TLR2 molecules, whereas the production of interleukin-l beta (IL-beta) and IL-13 was dependent on TLR2. These findings are the first to describe a role of gingival fibroblast in the recognition of C. albicans and the pathways involved in this process. An understanding of these pathways may lead to alternative treatments for patients with periodontal disease.

AB Background: Several studies suggest IL-17 is involved in the pathogenesis of organ fibrosis. The exact role of IL-17 in renal interstitial fibrosis has not been fully elucidated.
   Methods: We compared the histopathology of renal fibrosis as well as profibrotic TGP-beta signaling in wild-type (WT) and IL-17 knockout (IL-17(-/-)) mice using UUO as the disease model. To find out the possible mechanisms involved in the exacerbated renal fibrosis happened to IL-17 (-)(-/)mice, we analyzed the pattern of ECM synthesis by different fibroblasts cultured with IL-17 and associated signaling mediators.
   Results: On day3 and day7, IL-17 (-/-)mice developed more severe renal fibrosis compared with WT mice. IL-17 had an inhibitory factor in TGF-beta-induced renal fibroblast activation and ECM synthesis, and sequentially in renal interstitial fibrosis, via down-regulation of Smad-independent pathway (p38MAPK and AKT phosphorylations).
   Conclusion : IL-17 acts an inhibitory factor in TOP-II-induced renal fibroblast activation and ECM synthesis, and sequentially in renal interstitial fibrosis, via down-regulation of Smad-independent pathway (p38MAPK and AKT phosphorylations). Clarifying the novel regulatory mechanisms of fibrosis by the cytokine IL-17 may lead to a new therapeutic approach for progressive renal disease and fibrosis

AB Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex inflammatory, autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS). The disease pathogenesis is not well defined yet. Cytokines have an important role in inflammation as characteristic feature of the disease. Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcriptions (JAK/STAT) family promote cytokine-mediated cell activation. Failure in the JAK/STAT signaling pathway is associated with the pathological outcome in MS. In this study, we compared the expression levels of STAT5a and STAT6 genes in the blood of 50 relapsing-remitting MS (RR-MS) patients and 50 healthy controls by Taqman Quantitative Real-Time PCR in patients and healthy control group. We found that STAT5a expression was significantly down-regulated (p = .049), whereas STAT6 gene expression was significantly up-regulated (p = .046) in MS patients compared with controls. Moreover, there was significant correlation between the STAT6 gene expression and Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) criterion. However, no significant correlation was demonstrated between the expression of STAT5a gene and clinical findings. Furthermore, there was not significant correlation between expression levels of STAT5a and STAT6 genes. Our findings suggest that STAT5a and STAT6 dysregulation may have a critical role in modification of immune responses leading to imbalance between Th2- and Thl-related cytokines. However, the mechanisms underlying it still remain to be elucidated. Future studies are needed to explore the role of STAT5a and STAT6 as prognostic biomarkers in research, design of experimental therapies or clinical settings of the MS.

AB Introduction: The aim of this study was to analyse a panel of 60 angiogenic factors (pro-angiogenic and anti-angiogenic) in the plasma of women with mild preeclampsia.
   Materials and Methods: We recruited 21 women between 25 and 40 weeks gestation with diagnosed mild preeclampsia into the study group and 27 healthy women with uncomplicated pregnancies of corresponding gestational age to that of the study to the control group. We used a quantitative protein macroarray method that allowed for analysis of 60 angiogenic proteins per sample simultaneously.
   Results: We showed a statistically significant increase in the concentration of 8 proteins, interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), interleukin 6 (IL-6), leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), C-X-C motif chemokine 10 (IP-10), leptin and platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB), as well as a significant decrease in the concentration of 3 proteins, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), placental growth factor (P1GF) and follistatin, in the plasma of women with preeclampsia.
   Conclusion: Based on our findings, it seems that protein factors may play an important role in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia, and there are many proteins that have not been studied in PE to date. There are no previous studies assessing the LW, follistatin, HGF, HB-EGF and PDGF-BB concentrations in the plasma of women with PE; therefore, our obtained results indicate that these proteins are new factors that can play an important role in the pathomechanisms of PE.

AB Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) commonly occurs in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Clq/TNF-related protein-3 (CTRP3) levels are decreased in type 2 diabetic patients. However, to date, it is unknown whether low CTRP3 level are correlated with the incidence of NAFLD. The aim of this study was to observe this association in Chinese patients with T2DM. Overall, 175 newly diagnosed T2DM were recruited in this study. The subjects were divided into NAFLD group (n = 93) and control group (n = 82). Anthropometric parameters, blood pressure, and several biochemical parameters were measured. The body composition was assessed with the bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) method. Insulin level was evaluated by radio-immunoassay. Levels of serum CTRP3 and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Our findings demonstrated that type 2 diabetic patients with NAFLD had lower levels of serum CTRP3 than did those without NAFLD (P = .002). Serum CTRP3 level was negatively correlated with body mass index (r = -0.271, P = .001), visceral fat area (r = -0.285, P < .001), glycosylated hemoglobin Alc (r = -0.270, P < .001), triglycerides (r = -0.267, P < .001), CRP (r = -0.222, P = .010), IL-6 (r = -0.212, P = .008), and HOMA-IR indices (r = -0.334, P < .001). When compared with the highest CTRP3 tertile, the odds ratio of the middle tertile for NAFLD incidence was 4.54 (95% CI, 1.53-13.47) and 5.80 (95% CI, 1.60-21.02) for the lowest tertile after adjustment for confounding factors. In summary, low serum CTRP3 is a strong predictor for the prevalence of NAFLD in Chinese patients with newly diagnosed T2DM.

AB Knowledge of the soil water and stoichiometrical characteristics (SC) during long-term natural vegetation restoration is essential for managing the restoration of vegetation. To evaluate the response of soil water storage (SWS), soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen content (TN) and total phosphorous content (TP) to long-term natural vegetation restoration (similar to 160 a), we examined the soil moisture and SC in areas with different restoration ages located in the central part of the Loess Plateau, China. Our results showed that the SWS decreased significantly with vegetation restoration and that the C:P ratio, N:P ratio, TN and TP increased significantly. The SWS increased gradually, whereas the SOC, C:P ratio, N:P ratio, TN and TP in each restoration stage decreased significantly with increasing soil depth in the 0-60 cm soil layer. These parameters tended to be stable in the soil layer below 60 cm. Vegetation acts as a link between SWS and soil SC, and they interact with each other indirectly. SWS and SWC showed an significant positive relationship (P < 0.01), whereas SWS and SOC, TN, TP, C: P ratio, and N: P ratio showed significant negative relationships (P < 0.01), thus, SOC, TN and TP are the key chemical factors affecting SWS.. These results could help estimating the productivity and sustainability of semiarid ecosystems and improve future eco-environmental reconstructions.

AB The flow of effluent through treatment wetlands is influenced by the infrastructure set-up, the effluent character, the type of hydraulic flow, the mode of operation, the type of substrate, and the type and quantity of biomass. Current flow models have not been well validated, and/or do not accurately account for biomass clogging. In this study, treatment wetlands containing Dune or River sand with similar particle size distributions exhibited significant disparities in achievable flow rates. To gain insight into this phenomenon, further investigations were conducted to compare: (i) sand particle characteristics (size, elemental and mineral composition, grain morphology), (ii) the relationships between mineral composition and shape of the sand particles, (iii) the hydraulic conductivity of the different sand types before and after inducement of biomass growth, and (iv) the measured hydraulic conductivities with those predicted using the fractional packing Kozeny-Carman model.
   Using automated scanning electron microscopy (QEMSCAN T) it was determined that the shape of the quartz particles of the River sand (98% quartz) and calcite particles of the Dune sand (81% quartz, 18% calcite) were less round and more angular than the quartz particles of the Dune sand, and that the River sand particles were conglomerate in nature and/or fractured. The hydraulic conductivities of the Dune and River sands were significantly different (0.284 and 0.015 mm s(-1), respectively), and the hydraulic conductivity of the Dune sand decreased by 51% due to biomass accumulation. The fractional packing model overestimated the measured values.

AB Little is known about the effect of nitrogen (N) enrichment on alpine wetland plant N and phosphorus (P) limitations and N:P stoichiometry. We assessed the effects of N and P additions on plant nutrient limitations and N:P ratio in an alpine wetland complex on the Tibetan Plateau, China using a 3-year long factorial experiment. N and P were applied twice per year at an annual rate of 10 g m(-2) yr(-1) and 5 g m(-2) yr(-1), respectively. N addition significantly increased aboveground biomass, plant leaf N, plant leaf N:P ratio and soil available N:P ratio, but had no effect on plant leaf P and soil available P. Although N addition increased the plant N:P ratio it was still < 14. P addition increased plant and soil available P, decreased plant and soil N: P ratio, but had no effect on plant biomass. N + P additions had no additive effect on plant biomass over N additions alone, plant N or P, or soil available N or P. These results indicate that N, rather than P, is likely the limiting nutrient for biomass production in alpine wetlands in this region of Tibet and nutrient limitation does not shift from N to P with increasing N deposition. Thus, N deposition could have a significant influence on vegetation growth and biomass production.

AB Three diversion-type small-scale hydropower stations located in Jinggu County, Yunnan Province, China, were selected to study entrainment effects on phytoplankton. Samples were collected in May 2015 and November 2016, which were tested for the concentration of chlorophyll a, cell morphology structures, and the physiological and biochemical parameters of phytoplankton. Results showed that entrainment effects significantly resulted in approximately 20.63% decrease in phytoplankton biomass. Entrainment effects significantly increased the values of reactive oxygen species and fluorescein diacetate (p < 0.05), causing oxidative stress and activating the cell metabolism of the phytoplankton. Furthermore, the level of propidium iodide increased when algal individuals flowed through the hydropower station, indicating that the cell membrane integrity was damaged. Electron microscope observation results showed that parts of the algal cells were deformed through fractures and folding; some algae developed shrunken organelles, and cell walls and plasma membranes were fractured and broken. This research therefore demonstrates that small-scale hydropower stations can damage phytoplankton, but the negative impact of entrainment effects would recede if the stress diminished. However, a cumulative damage effect of the cascading diversion-type hydropower stations was not observed. This study provides a scientific proof for formulating ecological environment protection decisions when developing small-scale hydropower stations.

AB Crop co-planting is widely used in agriculture because it can increase total crop yields through increased resource use efficiency, and phytoremediation is based on the contaminant remediation system in plants. This study focused on the phytoextractive effects of co-planting Ricinus communis and/or legumes in Cd- and Zn-contaminated soil. A Cd-and Zn-contaminated factory relocation site in Shanghai was selected for the experiment, and according to the results of a potential ecological risk assessment of heavy metals, the study area was divided into 3 levels of pollution: slight, moderate, and high. The results showed that the presence of Medicago sativa can significantly increase the height and biomass of R. communis, and there was a greater impact on the chlorophyll content of R. communis at higher pollution levels. Differences in pollution levels could significantly change the oil content of R. communis plants, but M. sativa can alleviate the impact of heavy metals. The presence of M. sativa increased the cumulative amount of cadmium and zinc in R. communis by 1.14 and 2.19 times, respectively. In short, co-planting R. communis and legumes remediated contaminated soil and may be one practical phytoremediation pathway for heavy metal-contaminated soil in the future.

AB Quantitative assessment of ecosystem services in the Grazing Withdrawal Program (GWP) of China is required to understand the effectiveness of environmental protection programs and the sustainability of grassland ecosystems. This study focused on quantitative assessment of changes of key ecosystem services and their driving factors in the GWP from 2000 to 2013. Based on widely used biophysical models, including the GLOPEM-CEVSA model, the precipitation storage method, Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-Offs (InVEST), Revised Wind Erosion Equation (RWEQ) and Underground Productivity Model (UPM), this study integrated multi-source data to analyze dynamic changes of regulating services, including carbon sequestration, water regulation, sand fixation and soil retention, and the provisioning service of grassland yield. For the GWP area during 2000-2013, the ecosystem pattern remained relatively stable and multiple ecosystem services showed overall improvement but there were local deteriorations. For the 14 years net primary productivity (NPP) and grassland yield (GY) increased substantially. Water regulation in forest, grassland and wetland/water body ecosystems improved slightly. The soil conservation function of the entire ecosystem was slightly enhanced with soil retention showing an increasing spatial homogenization and wind erosion having a decreasing tendency. Ecological restoration and reconstruction efforts and climate change helped to improve ecosystem services. Increases in both temperature and precipitation and ecological rehabilitation had a positive effect on vegetation restoration related to a marked increase of vegetation coverage. Increase in annual precipitation increased rainfall related erosion but also assisted water regulation. Reduction in wind speed effectively lowered the occurrence of wind erosion. Vegetation restoration directly increased NPP and GY, and was conducive to water regulation and soil conservation. However, grassland degradation still continued in local areas. Ecological programs applied to the grasslands of China should be continued. Adopting adaptive management approaches that facilitate the synergy of multiple ecosystem services are required to maximize their benefit to the people of China.

AB Vegetation cover, specifically emergent macrophyte cover, is critical to the performance of constructed stormwater treatment wetlands which are widely used to protect receiving waterways. Maintenance of vegetation relies on a suitable water level regime, which in turn is governed by the hydraulic loading rate and efficiency of the outlet control structure. Wetland designers need to take these factors into account to avoid excessive depth and duration of inundation. We investigated the relationship between the water level regime and vegetation cover in 19 stormwater wetlands. We found a strong relationship between the median water level and vegetation cover, where vegetation cover was generally high (> 80%) at median depths < 0.35 m. Interestingly, poor outlet efficiency, rather than the hydraulic loading rate, was driving the water level regime. While this again highlights the importance of appropriate design and maintenance, we suggest that adjustable outlets in combination with real-time water level monitoring should be used to maintain a suitable water level regime in stormwater wetlands fed by dynamic urban catchments. The results of the study provide firm evidence for threshold depths for emergent macrophytes in stormwater wetlands which can be used to inform design guidelines.

AB This study aimed to compare the horizontal flow (HFCW) and vertical flow (VFCW) constructed wetland systems in treating dairy wastewater (DWW) and simultaneously harvesting plant biomass from units. The HFCW and VFCW were designed at lab-scale using cattail (Typha angustifolia) and changes in DWW parameters: pH, EC, TSS, NO3-N, NH4-N, PO4-3, SO4-2, Na, K, BOD5, COD and heavy metals (Fe, Cr and Ni) were investigated for 9 months. A setup without plant stand acted as control. The VFCW outperformed to HFCW in terms of removal of NH4-N, PO4-3, BOD5, COD, and heavy metals while NO3-N and SO4-2 showed high removal in HFCW. The principal component analysis (PCA) identified three major components from the 9 major variables accounted for 80.05 and 86.68 of the datasets in HECW and VFCW, respectively. The degree of variance suggested the high performance of VFCW than HFCW. The PCA showed slight variations in functioning of both systems in terms of interdependences of organic and inorganic pollution abetments. The biomass yield of Typha showed great variations between HFCW and VFCW system and relatively the VFCW produced more Typha biomass. The high heating value (HHV) calculated on the basis of proximate and ultimate results indicates that Typha biomass can be used as potential feedstock for renewable energy operations. The Typha based VFCW for dairy wastewater treatment can targets multiple purposes: nutrient capture, habitat restoration, bioenergy, carbon offsets, and water quality credits.

AB A metal resistant bacterium was isolated from the rhizosphere of Kair 'Capparis decidua' and screened for its phytoextraction ability under gradient metal stress conditions. Based on 16S rDNA analysis, the strain was identified as Enterobacter ludwigii. Among the plant growth promoting traits, isolate showed the ACC (1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate) deaminase activity, production of indole-3-acetic acid in tryptophan supplemented medium and solubilize the inorganic phosphate. The isolate was resistant to heavy metals like zinc (Zn), nickel (Ni), copper (Cu), and cadmium (Cd). The fatty acid adaptation of isolate growing at different concentration of Zn (100-300 mg kg(-1)) was also studied, which indicated that metal concentration strongly influenced the fatty acid composition of bacterium, particularly by increasing the unsaturated fatty acids. Furthermore, inoculation with the test isolate was found to significantly (p < 0.01) increase the various growth parameters of wheat plants and also improve the photosynthetic pigments. In addition, inoculation with isolate resulted in significant (p < 0.01) increase in the Zn content in wheat plant under metal stress. Moreover, bacterial application significantly (p < 0.01) increased the various compatible solutes such as proline content (30-65%), total soluble sugar (9-49%), and decreased the malondialdehyde (MDA) content (38-47%) as compared to control, illustrating its protective effect under metal induced oxidative stress. Inoculation with test isolate also increased the total protein content in range of 16-52%. Our work revealed that metal resistant plant growth promoting rhizobacterium could be exploited as microbial mediated phytoremediation of metal polluted soils.

AB The presence of nanoparticles in the wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) effluent is a potential threat to the ecosystem due to their effective antimicrobial properties. The aim of this study was to investigate the performance of a pilot-scale vertical flow constructed wetland (VFCW) for advanced wastewater treatment under long-term exposure to silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). The migration and fate of AgNPs were also examined to explore whether the CW had a capability of nanoparticles removal. The results suggested that AgNPs (20 mu g/L) showed acutely inhibitory effects on nitrogen and phosphorus removal at the initial exposure stage, followed by the persistent inhibition with time. The average removal efficiencies decreased by 16%, 11%, and 11% for NH+4-N, TN, and TP, respectively. For COD removal, no changes were found. The effluent of CW under AgNPs exposure could still reach the first level A of the People's Republic of China's Discharge standard of pollutants for municipal wastewater treatment plant (GB18918-2002). In addition, CW showed a satisfactory AgNPs removal efficiency of 93%. The accumulation of AgNPs in different parts from high to low was soil (88.93%), effluent (7.35%), substrate (3.40%), and plant (0.32%). AgNPs enriched by plant roots were mainly transported to above ground. It demonstrated that the presence of soil layer and wetland plant Iris pseudacorus is essential for AgNPs removal. The study may provide valuable references for evaluating the ecological effects of nanoparticles.

AB Satisfactory pain control for women undergoing surgical abortion is important for patient comfort and satisfaction. Clinicians ought to be aware of the safety and efficacy of different pain control regimens. This document will focus on nonpharmacologic modalities to reduce pain and pharmacologic interventions up to the level of minimal sedation. For surgical abortion without intravenous medications, a multimodal approach to pain control may combine a dedicated emotional-support person, visual or auditory distraction, administration of local anesthesia to the cervix with buffered lidocaine and a preoperative nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. Oral opioids do not decrease procedural pain. Oral anxiolytics decrease anxiety but not the experience of pain. Further research is needed on alternative options to control pain short of moderate or deep sedation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: We performed a systematic review to look for an association between progestin-only contraception and depression.
   Methods: We searched PubMed, Ovid and Web of Science for English-language articles including progestin-only contraception and depression from database inception to September 2016. We evaluated study quality with the procedures guiding reviews for the United States Preventive Services Task Force and the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tools. We included studies that evaluated progestin-only contraception and depression, focusing on externally validated depression measures. We excluded case studies, review articles and other psychiatric disorders.
   Results: We identified 26 studies that met the inclusion criteria, including 5 randomized controlled trials, 11 cohort studies and 10 cross-sectional studies. We found minimal association between progestin-only methods and depression. No correlation with depression was found in five low-quality, high-risk-of-bias progestin subdermal implant studies and four out of five varying-quality and medium-risk-of-bias levonorgestrel intrauterine device studies. Three medroxyprogesterone acetate intramuscular injection trials with varying levels of quality and bias show no difference in depression. Two progestin-only contraceptive pill studies with varying levels of quality and bias indicate no increase in depression scores, while one good-quality, medium-bias study shows an association between progestin-only pills, the intrauterine device and depression.
   Conclusion: Despite perceptions in the community of increased depression following the initiation of progestin contraceptives, the preponderance of evidence does not support an association based on validated measures (mostly level II-1 evidence, moderate quality, low risk of bias).

AB Objective: The objective was to compare the safety and efficacy of an algorithm for abortion intravenous sedation dosing (AAID) to standard dosing during first-trimester surgical abortion.
   Study design: This was a randomized, single-blinded, controlled trial in which women undergoing first-trimester surgical abortion received fentanyl and midazolam dosed per either an algorithm or clinic standard. Patient-level factors including weight, airway risk, anxiety, and drug and alcohol use determined MID doses. The primary outcome was pain with suction curettage measured immediately on a 21-point verbal numerical rating scale ranging from 0 to 100. Secondary outcomes included pain with cervical dilation and postprocedure, intraoperative pain as recalled postprocedure, need for additional doses of medication, oxygen saturation<93%, sedation level, adverse events, side effects and patient satisfaction.
   Results: We enrolled 196 women and randomized 98 to the AAID and 98 to standard care. Baseline factors were similar between groups. Median intraoperative pain scores did not differ between groups when measured immediately (47.5 vs. 50, p=.81) or on recall (30 in both arms, p=.68). There were no significant differences in other secondary outcomes. Women with a body mass index (BMI) 30-35 trended toward improved pain control with the algorithm (60 vs. 27.5, p=.07).
   Conclusions: Intravenous sedation determined by an algorithm did not produce differences in pain scores in a setting with highly experienced providers. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: The objective was to describe factors associated with reported pain and assess correlations between participant and provider pain assessments during first-trimester vacuum aspiration.
   Study design: Participants and providers in a trial evaluating music for pain reduction reported procedure-related pain using a 100-mm visual analog scale.
   Results: The mean participant-reported maximum pain was 65.9 +/- 23.0 compared to 41.3 +/- 22.0 by provider assessment. Provider-reported scores correlated poorly with participant maximum pain (r=0.28) and participant maximum pain adjusted for baseline (r=0.27). Previous abortion (60.5 versus 71.4, p=.02) and immediate intrauterine device insertion (46.1 versus 68.6, p=.03) were associated with lower participant-reported pain.
   Conclusions: Providers underestimate pain reported during vacuum aspiration; provider estimates correlate poorly with participant self-report. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Our objective was to document current practices of abortion providers on the use of medications to decrease bleeding during surgical abortion.
   Study design: We emailed surveys to 336 abortion providers through a professional listserv to elicit information on their use of medications to prevent and treat bleeding during first- and second-trimester surgical abortion.
   Results: One hundred sixty-eight (50%) providers responded to our survey. The majority were obstetrician-gynecologists (83%) working in an academic practice (66%). Most completed a fellowship in family planning (87%) and currently perform abortions up to 22 or 24 weeks of gestation (63%). Seventy-two percent routinely used prophylactic medications for bleeding. Providers who routinely used medications to prevent bleeding most commonly chose vasopressin (83%). Providers preferred methylergonovine as a treatment for excessive bleeding in the second trimester, followed by misoprostol.
   Conclusion: We found that most providers routinely use medications to prevent bleeding and use several different regimens to treat bleeding during abortion. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Objective: The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the efficacy of pretreatment with letrozole prior to either a first- or second-trimester medical termination of pregnancy.
   Study design: We searched letrozole, femara, aromatase inhibitors, abortifacient agents, termination of pregnancy and labor induction in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Database, Google Scholar and PubMed from inception of each database until September 2015 with no language limitation. A systematic review of all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was performed where women received either letrozole and misoprostol or placebo and misoprostol for termination of pregnancy. The primary outcome was complete abortion rate, defined as complete evacuation of the products of conception from the uterus. Relative risk with 95% confidence intervals was used to report data.
   Results: Our systematic review identified 7 studies; 4 RCTs were included in the review. Two RCTs evaluated terminations of pregnancy up to 9 weeks' gestation, while 2 evaluated terminations over 9 weeks' gestation. For each gestational age group, one trial supported an increase in complete abortion rate, while the other showed no difference, with letrozole and misoprostol compared with placebo and misoprostol. Time-to-abortion interval for terminations up to 9 weeks' gestation was not improved with the addition of letrozole to misoprostol. For terminations over 9 weeks' gestation, one trial supported and one trial refuted a decrease in time-to-abortion interval with letrozole and misoprostol. Similarly, for each gestational age group, one study supported a decrease and one study showed no difference in rate of dilation and curettage (D&C) with letrozole and misoprosol. Medication side effects were similar between both treatment groups. There was significant heterogeneity between the trials, and therefore, the results were not meta-analyzed.
   Conclusions: Some studies and trials report better outcomes (i.e., complete abortion rates, time-to-abortion and D&C rates) in women exposed to letrozole and misoprostol compared to placebo and misoprostol, while other trials demonstrate no difference. Further research exploring letrozole pretreatment prior to medical abortion is required.
   Implications: This systematic review demonstrated that a combination of letrozole and misoprostol increased the rate of complete abortion compared to misoprostol alone in some studies but not in others; additional well designed RCT's are needed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID 2ND-TRIMESTER ABORTION; FETAL DEMISE; SAFETY; EXPERIENCES; CHOICE; PAIN
AB Objective: We sought to qualitatively understand patients' experiences with digoxin as a step before dilation and evacuation (D&E).
   Study design: We recruited English-speaking women from one abortion health center where digoxin is routinely used before D&E. We interviewed participants one to three weeks after the D&E about physical and emotional experiences with digoxin and understanding of its purpose. Using grounded theory, we analyzed transcripts iteratively, identifying themes from interviews; we stopped recruitment when we reached thematic saturation.
   Results: We conducted 20 interviews and participants described mixed experiences. Three overarching themes from the qualitative interviews were: (1) physical and emotional discomfort; (2) varied understanding of digoxin's purpose and effects; and (3) reassurance. Most participants described significantly negative experiences with digoxin; however, many participants also described positive aspects of the injection intermingled with those negative experiences.
   Conclusions: Participants' experiences with digoxin before D&E were both polarized and nuanced. While participants were largely clear about digoxin's action, they were much less clear about the reason for its use. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

   Pregnancy termination; Abortion; Fetal anomalies
ID SHARED DECISION-MAKING; TERMINATION; CARE; IMPACT; WOMEN
AB Objective: We sought to explore the relationship between counseling quality, measured by shared decision making and decision satisfaction, and psychological outcomes (anxiety, grief, and posttraumatic stress) after second-trimester abortion for pregnancy complications.
   Study design: We conducted a cross-sectional study of women who underwent second-trimester abortion for complications. We recruited participants from Facebook and online support groups and surveyed them about counseling experiences and psychosocial issues. We used multivariate linear regression to evaluate relationships between counseling quality and psychological outcomes.
   Results: We analyzed data from 145 respondents. Shared decision making and decision satisfaction scores were positively and strongly correlated in bivariate analysis (r=0.7, p<.0001), as were posttraumatic stress and grief scores (r=0.7, p<.0001). In the adjusted analysis, higher decision satisfaction was associated with lower grief and posttraumatic stress scores (p=.02 and p=.01, respectively) and higher shared decision making was associated with lower posttraumatic stress scores (p=.01).
   Conclusions: Decision satisfaction and shared decision making have a positive effect on psychological outcomes after second-trimester abortion for pregnancy complications. Counseling quality may be especially important in this setting given the sensitive nature of decisions regarding pregnancy termination for complications.
   Implication: These results highlight the importance of patient-centered counseling for women seeking pregnancy termination. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Inc.

ID PATIENT PREFERENCE TRIAL; WOMEN
AB Objectives: To measure the 24-month impact on continuation, unintended pregnancy and satisfaction of trying long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) in a population seeking short-acting reversible contraception (SARC).
   Study design: We enrolled 916 women aged 18-29 who were seeking pills or injectables in a partially randomized patient preference trial. Women with strong preferences for pills or injectables started on those products, while others opted for randomization to LARC or SARC and received their methods gratis. We estimated continuation and unintended pregnancy rates through 24 months. Intent-to-treat principles were applied after method initiation for comparing incidence of unintended pregnancy. We also examined how satisfaction levels varied by cohort and how baseline negative LARC attitudes were associated with satisfaction over time.
   Results: Forty-three percent chose randomization, and 57% chose the preference option. Complete loss to followup was <2%. The 24-month LARC continuation probability was 64.3% [95% confidence interval (CI): 56.6-70.9], statistically higher than SARC groups [25.5% (randomized) and 40.0% (preference)]. The 24-month cumulative unintended pregnancy probabilities were 9.9% (95% CI: 7.2-12.6) (preference-SARC), 6.9% (95% CI: 3.3-10.6) (randomized-SARC) and 3.6% (95% CI: 1.8-6.4) (randomized-LARC). Statistical tests for comparing randomized groups on unintended pregnancy were mixed: binomial at 24-month time point (p=.02) and log-rank survival probabilities (p=.14 for first pregnancies and p=.07 when including second pregnancies). LARC satisfaction was high (80% happy/neutral, 73% would use LARC again, 81% would recommend to a friend). Baseline negative attitudes toward LARC (27%) were not clearly associated with satisfaction or early discontinuation.
   Conclusions: The decision to try [ARC resulted in high continuation rates and substantial protection from unintended pregnancy over 24 months. Despite participants' initial desires to begin short-acting regimens, they had high satisfaction with [ARC. Voluntary decisions to try [ARC will benefit large proportions of typical SARC users.
   Implications: Even women who do not necessarily view LARC as a first choice may have a highly satisfying experience and avoid unintended pregnancy if they try it. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Etonogestrel implant use in women primarily choosing a combined oral
   contraceptive pill: A proof-of-concept trial
SO CONTRACEPTION
LA English
DT Article
DE etonogestrel; implant; combined oral contraceptive; vaginal bleeding
ID RANDOMIZED-CONTROLLED-TRIAL
AB Objective: We evaluated a novel concept of initiating the etonogestrel implant as a "back-up" method in women who desire using combined oral contraceptives (COC) but want to decrease their risk of unintended pregnancy with a more effective method.
   Study Design: In this prospective cohort study, we planned to include 20 women as a proof-of-concept. We enrolled both new COC starters and continuing COC users and placed an etonogestrel implant. Participants completed daily bleeding diaries and attended follow-up visits at 1, 3, and 6 months. We assessed implant continuation through six months of study participation and side effects with dual hormonal contraceptive use.
   Results: Between September and December 2016, we enrolled 10 new starters and 10 current COC users. All participants completed 1-month follow-up, and 18 (90%) subjects completed the 3- and 6-month follow-up assessments. Two current COC users had the implant removed for mood changes before 6 months. At the 6-month follow-up visit, 10 women were using both pills and implant, seven relied on the implant only, and one was using a COC only. Three new starters chose implant removal at end of study participation; one for weight gain and acne, another for mood changes, and one for decreased libido. No subjects discontinued the implant for bleeding complaints.
   Conclusion: In this proof-of-concept study, women using COCs were willing to initiate the implant as a "back-up" method to improve pregnancy prevention. Most women continued the implant through 6 months and after completing study participation.
   Implications: Initiating the etonogestrel implant as a "back-up" method may be an option for women who desire more effective pregnancy prevention while using combined oral contraceptive pills for its bleeding profile or non-contraceptive benefits. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To assess patterns of contraceptive use at last intercourse among women with physical or cognitive disabilities compared to women without disabilities.
   Study design: We analyzed responses to 12 reproductive health questions added by seven states to their 2013 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System questionnaire. Using responses from female respondents 18-50 years of age, we performed multinomial regression to calculate estimates of contraceptive use among women at risk for unintended pregnancy by disability status and type, adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, marital status, education, health insurance status, and parity.
   Results: Women with disabilities had similar rates of sexual activity as women without disabilities (90.0% vs. 90.6%, p=.76). Of 5995 reproductive-aged women at risk for unintended pregnancy, 1025 (17.1%) reported one or more disabilities. Contraceptive use at last intercourse was reported by 744 (70.1%) of women with disabilities compared with 3805 (74.3%) of those without disabilities (p=.22). Among women using contraception, women with disabilities used male or female permanent contraception more often than women without disabilities (333 [29.6%] versus 1337 [23.1%], p<.05). Moderately effective contraceptive (injection, oral contraceptive, patch, or ring) use occurred less frequently among women with cognitive (13.1%, n=89) or independent living (13.9%, n=40) disabilities compared to women without disabilities (22.2%, n=946, p<.05).
   Conclusions: The overall prevalence of sexual activity and contraceptive use was similar for women with and without physical or cognitive disabilities. Method use at last intercourse varied based on presence and type of disability, especially for use of permanent contraception. Published by Elsevier Inc.

DT Article

ID TUBAL-STERILIZATION; PATTERNS; REGRET
AB Objective: To learn whether a version of the Medicaid Sterilization Consent Form (SCF) adapted for populations of low-literacy can help Spanish-speaking women better understand the process and consequences of tubal sterilization.
   Study design: We randomly assigned Spanish-speaking women, ages 21-45 years, to review either a "standard" or "low-literacy" version of the Medicaid SCF. We assessed sterilization-related knowledge using items from the Postpartum Tubal Sterilization Knowledge questionnaire, using as the primary outcome correct identification of least four or more knowledge items and as secondary outcome participants' preferred version of the SCF.
   Results: Overall sterilization-related knowledge was low in both groups, with 33% of women (n=100) who reviewed the standard SCF form and 42% of those who reviewed the low-literacy form (n=100) correctly identifying four or more knowledge-related items (p=.19). Regarding specific items, women in the low-literacy SCF group were more likely than those in the standard SCF group to understand the permanence of sterilization (69% versus 49%, p<.01) and the time requirement between signing the consent document and undergoing sterilization (79% versus 59%, p<.01). The groups were similar in appreciating availability of equally effective nonpermanent contraceptive options (71% versus 64%, p=.29), time from signing to expiration (33% versus 38%, p =.46), or non-binding nature of sterilization consent (55% versus 62%, p=.32). Overall, 71% of participants from both groups preferred the low-literacy form.
   Conclusion: In our patient population, characterized by low educational attainment and inadequate health literacy skills, a low-literacy SCF did not improve overall sterilization-related knowledge when compared to the standard SCF. The low-literacy version did improve understanding of the permanence of sterilization and time requirements to undergo the procedure.
   Implications: Neither form conveyed an adequate level of knowledge to this vulnerable Spanish-speaking population. Therefore, a considerable need persists for detailed education regarding availability of equally effective reversible contraceptive options, procedure-related risks, and permanence of sterilization throughout the process of informed consent.

AB Objective: The objective was to determine population-based estimates of use of contraception among women 15-44 years of age in the United States by disability status.
   Study design: We examined the relationship between disability status and use of contraception among 7505 women at risk of unintended pregnancy using data from the 2011-2015 National Survey of Family Growth.
   Results: After examining the full distribution of contraceptive method use by disability status, we found that disability status was significantly associated with differences in three categories of use: female sterilization, the oral contraceptive pill and nonuse of contraception. Multivariate analysis shows that use of female sterilization was higher among women with cognitive disabilities (aOR=1.54, 95% CI=1.12-2.12) and physical disabilities (aOR=1.59, CI =1.08-2.35) than for those without disabilities after controlling for age, parity, race, insurance coverage and experience of unintended births. Use of the pill was less common among women with physical disabilities than for those without disabilities (aOR=0.57, CI= 0.40-0.82). Finally, not using a method was more common among women with cognitive disabilities (aOR=1.90, CI=1.36-2.66).
   Conclusions: Self-reported cognitive disabilities ("serious difficulty concentrating, remembering or making decisions"), as well as physical disabilities, are significant predictors of contraceptive choices after controlling for several known predictors of use.
   Implications: The patterns found here suggest that screening for self-reported cognitive and physical disabilities may allow health care providers to tailor counseling and sex education to help women with disabilities prevent unintended pregnancy and reach their family size goals.

ID TUBAL-STERILIZATION; UNITED-STATES; CONTRACEPTION; TEXAS; REQUESTS;
   BARRIERS; DEMAND; RISK
AB Objective: We sought to assess fulfillment of sterilization requests while accounting for the complex interplay between insurance, clinical and social factors in a contemporary context that included both inpatient and outpatient postpartum sterilization procedures.
   Study design: This is a retrospective single-center cohort chart review study of 1331 women with a documented contraceptive plan at time of postpartum discharge of sterilization. We compared sterilization fulfillment within 90 days of delivery, time to sterilization and rate of subsequent pregnancy after nonfulfillmenf between women with Medicaid and women with private insurance.
   Results: A total of 475 of 1030 Medicaid-insured and 100 of 154 privately insured women received postpartum sterilization (46.1% vs. 64.9%, p<.001). Women with Medicaid had a longer time from delivery to completion of the sterilization request (p<.001). After adjusting for age, parity, gestational age, mode of delivery, adequacy of prenatal care, race/ethnicity, marital status and education level, private insurance status was not associated with either sterilization fulfillment [odds ratio 0.94, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54-1.64] or time to sterilization (hazard ratio 1.03, 95% C.I. 0.73-1.34). Of the 555 Medicaid-insured women who did not receive a postpartum sterilization, 267 (48.1%) had valid Title XIX sterilization consent forms at time of delivery. Of women who did not receive sterilization, 132 of 555 Medicaid patients and 5 of 54 privately insured patients became pregnant within 1 year (23.8% vs. 9.3%, p=.023).
   Conclusion: Differences in fulfillment rates of postpartum sterilization and time to sterilization between women with Medicaid versus private insurance are similar after adjusting for relevant clinical and demographic factors. Women with Medicaid are more likely than women with private insurance to have a short interval repeat pregnancy after an unfulfilled sterilization request.
   Implications: Efforts are needed to ensure that Medicaid recipients who desire sterilization receive timely services. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The self-renewal capacity of germline derived stem cells (GSCs) makes them an ideal source for research and use in clinics. Despite the presence of active gene network similarities between embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and GSCs, there are unanswered questions regarding the roles of evolutionary conserved genes in GSCs. To determine the reprogramming potential of germ cell-specific genes, we designed a polycistronic gene cassette expressing Stella, Oct4 and Nanos2 in a lentiviral-based vector. Deep transcriptome analysis showed the activation of a set of pluripotency and germ-cell-specific markers and the downregulation of innate immune system. The global shut down of antiviral genes included MHC class I, interferon response genes and dsRNA 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase are critical pathways that has been affected. Individual expression of each factor highlighted sup-pressive effect of Nanos2 on genes such as Isg15 and Oas12. Collectively, to our knowledge this is the first report showing that Nanos2 could be considered as an immunosuppressive factor. Furthermore, our results demonstrate suppression of endogenous retrotransposons that harbor immune response but further analysis require to uncover the correlation between transposon suppression and immune response in germ cell development.

AB Interleukin 10 (IL-10) is an anti-inflammatory cytokine with a protective role in the formation and the development of the atherosclerotic plaque. The aim of the present study was to establish if IL-10 gene polymorphisms are associated with the development of premature coronary artery disease (pCAD) and cardiovascular risk factors in Mexican individuals. Three IL-10 gene polymorphisms [-592C/A (rs1800872), -819C/T (rs1800871), and -1082 A/G (rs1800896)] and IL 10 plasma levels were analyzed in 2266 individuals (1160 pCAD patients and 1106 healthy controls). Under recessive and co-dominant2 models, the -1082 A/G (rsl 800896) G allele was associated with decreased risk of developing pCAD (OR = 0.572, P-rec , = 0.022 and OR = 0.567, P-cod2 = 0.023). In pCAD patients, the polymorphisms were associated with hyperinsulinemia, small and dense LDLs, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. In the control group, the polymorphisms were associated with hypertension, hyperuricemia, and small and dense LDLs. pCAD patients have significantly higher IL-10 plasma levels than healthy controls [0.91 (0.55-1.67) pg/mL vs 0.45 (0.24-0.98) pg/mL, respectively, P < 0.0001]. Nevertheless, these levels were not associated with the genotypes analyzed in the present study. The results suggest that the IL-10-1082 A/G (rs1800896) G allele is associated with a decreased risk of developing pCAD. In patients and controls, the polymorphisms analyzed were associated with some cardiovascular risk factors. Although, in pCAD patients the IL-10 plasma levels were higher, they were not associated with the genotypes of the polymorphisms examined.

AB Osteoprotegerin (OPG), receptor activator of NF-kappa 13 ligand (RANKL), and parathyroid hormone (PTH) play a central role in the regulation of bone turnover in chronic kidney disease (CKD), but their influence on bone mineral density (BMD) and strength remains unclear, particularly in children. We studied the clinical significance of OPG and RANKL in relation to PTH, femur weight, BMD, and bone biomechanical properties in growing rats after one month (CKD-1) and three months (CKD-3) of surgically-induced mild CKD. Gene expression of parathyroid hormone 1 receptor (PTH1R) and activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), major regulators of anabolic PTH response in bone, was also determined. Serum PTH and bone PTH1R/ATF4 expression was elevated in CKD-3 compared with other groups, and it positively correlated with femur weight, BMD, and the biomechanical properties of the femoral diaphysis reflecting cortical bone strength. In contrast, bone RANKL/OPG ratios were decreased in CKD-3 rats compared with other groups, and they were inversely correlated with PTH and the other abovementioned bone parameters. However, the PTH-PTH1R-ATF4 axis exerted an unfavorable effect on the biomechanical properties of the femoral neck. In conclusion, this study showed for the first time an inverse association between serum PTH and the bone RANKL/OPG system in growing rats with mild CKD. A decrease in the RANKL/OPG ratio, associated with PTH-dependent activation of the anabolic PTH1R/ ATF4 pathway, seems to be responsible for the unexpected, beneficial effect of PTH on cortical bone accrual and strength. Simultaneously, impaired biomechanical properties of the femoral neck were observed, making this bone site more susceptible to fractures.

AB Background: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) contributes to type 2 diabetes (T2DM) pathogenesis, and genetic variations in VEGFA gene were suggested to influence VEGF secretion and T2DM pathogenesis.
   Aim: To evaluate the association of specific VEGFA variants with altered VEGF levels, and with T2DM among Tunisians.
   Subjects and methods: A retrospective case-control study, performed on 815 T2DM patients, and 805 healthy controls. VEGF levels were measured by ELISA, genotyping of VEGFA variants was done by allelic exclusion method (real-time PCR).
   Results: MAF of rs1570360, rs2010963, rs25648, rs833068, rs3025036, and rs3025039 were significantly different between T2DM cases and controls. Increased T2DM risk was associated with rs699947, rs1570360, and rs3025020, while reduced T2DM risk was seen with rs1547651, rs2010963, rs25648, rs3025036, and rs3025039 genotypes, thus assigning T2DM susceptibility and protection, respectively. Reduced VEGF levels were associated with rs833061, rs2010963, and rs3025039 heterozygosity and rs3025036 major allele homozygosity in T2DM cases, while increased VEGF levels were seen in rs833070 homozygous major allele genotype. Both rs699947 and rs1570360 positively, while rs2010963 and rs3025036 negatively correlated with fasting glucose. In addition, rs699947 positively correlated with LDL-cholesterol, and rs3025039 positively correlated with diabetes duration, but negatively with HbAl c and serum triglycerides. Haploview analysis identified Block 1 containing 8 loci, and Block 2 with the remaining 3 loci. Haplotypes ACTGCCGG and AACGGCGA (Block 1) were negatively associated with T2DM, while haplotype CCC was positively and haplotype CGC (Block 2) were negatively associated with T2DM.
   Conclusion: This study confirms the contribution of altered VEGF secretion, resulting from genetic variation in VEGFA gene into T2DM pathogenesis, hence supporting role for VEGFA as T2DM candidate locus.

AB This study detected and compared the levels of IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, TGF-beta and nitric oxide (NO) in amniotic fluid (AF) and serum of pregnancies with acute toxoplasmosis, Southern Brazil. It also was compared the levels of the same mediators in the serum of pregnancies in acute and chronic toxoplasmosis with non-infected. Serological investigation , anti-T gondii IgM and IgG, of the 67 pregnancies was determined by Elisa MEIA. Forty two were uninfected, eight in chronic phase and 17 in acute phase. Among the acute phase, seven agreed to amniocentesis. The cytokines, in serum and in AF, were assessed by sandwich ELISA, and NO was estimated from the nitrite measurement with Griess reagent. The IFN- gamma and TGF-beta levels in the AF and blood were similar, while TNF-alpha levels was lower in the AF. On the other hand, NO was higher in the AF. Chronically infected pregnant women have showed lower levels of INF-gamma than those in acute and uninfected pregnancies. The serological levels of TNF-alpha were lower in pregnancies with toxoplasmosis, when compared with non-infected. TGF-beta levels were higher in pregnancies in acute phase when compared with uninfected or chronically infected. NO in the serum of the infected had lower levels than those non-infected. In summary, higher concentrations of NO and lower levels of TNF-alpha were observed in the AF than in the serum of acute pregnancies, while TGF-beta e INF-gamma levels were similar in both biological material. In the serum of infected pregnancies was observed decrease in inflammatory mediators and increase of TGF-beta.

AB Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate serum levels of adiponectin, leptin, visfatin and IL-6 in patients with pleomorphic adenoma, Warthin's tumor and acinic cell carcinoma of the parotid gland.
   Materials and methods: Venous blood samples were collected from 30 patients with pleomorphic adenoma, 21 patients with Warthin's tumor and 8 patients with acinic cell carcinoma. Serum adiponectin, leptin, visfatin, IL-6 and CRP concentrations were determined.
   Results: Our results revealed significantly lower adiponectin serum levels in patients with malignant tumors compared to benign tumor individuals. Moreover, in benign cases the level was significantly higher compared to controls. Furthermore, serum leptin concentrations of benign tumor patients were higher compared to controls. Those differences, however, were observed only in males. The serum visfatin level was elevated in all tumor subjects compared to healthy individuals, whereas the serum IL-6 concentration was similar.
   Conclusions: We anticipate that adiponectin may play a potential protective role in salivary gland tumors. Also leptin and visfatin seem to play an important role in salivary gland tumor pathology, although in males and females leptin may act or be regulated in a different manner. The influence of visfatin on salivary gland tumors is probably independent of IL-6 production.

AB Animals with impaired transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 1 signaling developed spontaneous lethal autoimmune inflammation and autoimmune diseases. Moreover, evidence for modified TGF-beta signaling in atopic dermatitis (AD) exists. Therefore, the goal of this study was to determine whether SB-431542, a potent and selective inhibitor of the TGF-beta type 1 receptor (TGF-[beta R1), could attenuate such a severe reaction in mice. In addition, the molecular underpinnings the possible protective effects were also investigated. Repeated epicutaneous application of DNCB was performed on the ear and shaved dorsal skin of mice to induce AD-like symptoms and skin lesions. SB-431542 (1 mg/kg) was given by intra-peritoneal injection three times weekly for 3 weeks to assess the anti-pruritic effects. Serum levels of TGF-beta 1, TOF beta R1, latency-associated peptide (LAP), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1 beta and IL-6 were assessed by ELISA. Moreover, the gene expression of TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta and IL-6 were determined. Apoptotic pathway was evaluated by measuring the activity of caspase-3 and by staining skin sections with anti-caspase-3 antibodies. We found that SB-431542 alleviated DNCB-induced AD-like symptoms as quantified by skin lesion, dermatitis score, ear thickness and scratching behavior. In parallel, SS 431542 blocked DNCB-induced elevation in serum levels of TNF-alpha, TGF-beta 1, TGF-beta R1, LAP, IL-1 beta, IL-6 and IgE. The collective results indicate that SB-431542 partially suppresses DNCB-induced AD in mice via reduction of TGF-131 signaling pathway associated with inhibition of inflammation and apoptosis.

AB Background: Proliferative diabetic retinopathy is a devastating complication of diabetes mellitus, developing within 15 years in 50% of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM) and in 10% of patients with type 2 DM. The correlation between levels of inflammatory markers in the peripheral blood and retinopathy staging has not been studied yet, and the purpose of this prospective study was to find a possible association between in-flammation and staging of diabetic retinopathy.
   Methods: A prospective (pilot) study that measured level of adhesion molecules in the peripheral blood of 10 healthy subjects and 30 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Patients were grouped by the degree of retinopathy: 10 without retinopathy, 10 with non-proliferative retinopathy [NPDR] and 10 with proliferative retinopathy [PDR]. After signing the consent form, an ophthalmologic examination was performed, and 10 mL of blood was drawn. In order to assess adhesion molecules' level serum samples were collected, frozen, and stored at a temperature of -80 degrees C until analysis was performed as one batch.
   Results: 10 healthy volunteers and 30 patients were enrolled. Healthy volunteers were younger (36.6 +/- 7.9 years) compared to patients (no retinopathy 64.5 +/- 10.8 years, NPDR 71.4 +/- 8.9 years, and PDR 63.3 +/- 11.6 years) (p = .0003 for all groups of patients in comparison with the healthy subjects). VCAM-1 levels were increased by retinopathy staging - starting from 81.86 +/- 3.80 ng/ml (healthy), 105.55 +/- 1.37 ng/ ml (no retinopathy), 111.78 +/- 4.14 ng/ml (NPDR), and 123.45 +/- 3.99 ng/ml (PDR), with a significant difference between healthy and patients without retinopathy(p = .03), between no retinopathy and NPDR (p = .001), and between NPDR and PDR (p < .0001). E selectin was increased in correlation with severity of the retinopathy, with a significant difference between groups of patients (p = .03 between healthy subjects and T2DM patients without retinopathy, p = .001 between patients with T2DM no retinopathy and NPDR, p < .0001 between NPDR and PDR).
   Conclusions: We found a significant increase in levels of adhesion molecules (VCAM-1) and selectins (E-selectin) in parallel with increased severity of diabetic retinopathy, with a significant difference of inflammatory markers between stages of retinopathy.

AB Leprosy is a chronic infectious granulomatous disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae, in which the clinical outcome depends on the pattern of the host immune response. Because it is a spectral disease, leprosy is a good model for studying the immunology of the pathogen-host relationship. Although previous studies have characterized the participation of cytokine profiles such as Th1, Th2, Th7, Treg, Th9, and Th22 responses in leprosy, the role of new cytokines such as IL-37 have not yet been described for the spectral model of the disease. Here, we used an immunohistochemical technique to evaluate IL-37 expression in the skin of patients with leprosy. The expression of this cytokine was observed in the keratinocytes, endothelial cells, macrophages, and lymphocytes. Moreover, the IL-37 expression level was increased in patients with the tuberculoid (TT) form when compared to those with the lepromatous leprosy (LL) form in keratinocytes, endotheliocytes, and lymphocytes. However, in the macrophages, the cytokine expression was more intense in the LL form of the disease. These results point to the effective participation of IL-37 in the immunopathogenesis of leprosy, which is expressed in both the epidermal cells and the dermis.

AB Background: The present study was designed to compare inflammatory and metabolic responses according to severity of airflow among patients with COPD and to verify the relationship between pulmonary function, body composition, metabolic and inflammatory profile.
   Methods: Fifty-one patients with mild to very severe COPD were recruited and divided according lung function in Mild-moderate (GOLD 1-2) n = 21; Severe (GOLD 3) n = 25 and Very severe (GOLD 4) n = 5. Patients were submitted to assessments of lung function (spirometry), functional exercise capacity (6-min walk test), body composition (Octopolar bioelectrical impedance), metabolic profile (glucose, triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and albumin (colorimetric assay)) and inflammatory profile (cytokines: IL-6, IL-10, TNF-alpha and IL-15 (ELISA)).
   Results: We found that patients in GOLD 3 group had lower levels of IL-10, triglycerides, visceral fat area, and higher IL-6 and IL-6/IL-10 ratio when compared to GOLD 1-2 patients. Additionally, GOLD 1-2 group presented negative correlation between TNF-a and HDL cholesterol (p = .01) and positive correlation between IL-15 and FEVl /FVC (p = .01), while GOLD 3 group showed positive correlation between IL-6 and IL-10 (p < .01), IL-6 and total cholesterol (p < .01) and negative correlation between IL-10 and HDL-cholesterol (p = .01).
   Conclusion: Our findings suggest that patients with severe COPD can exhibit compromised "inflammatory status", characterized by higher IL6, IL-6/IL-10 ratio and lower IL-10 concentration. Furthermore, IL-10 seems to be an interesting cytokine to be investigated in this kind of patients.

AB Antipsychotic drugs are used to treat schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders. However, most of these drugs present side effects causing obesity and other serious metabolic alterations that correlate with grade of chronic inflammation. In contrast, ziprasidone's (ZIP) metabolic side effects are attenuated relative to those of other antipsychotic drugs, but some reports suggest that this drug could cause allergic, hypersensitive reactions in susceptible patients. At present, the mechanism of ZIP's effect on peripheral inflammatory metabolism is not well characterized. We conducted an in vitro study to evaluate the effect of ZIP on a macrophage cell line (RAW 264.1). Our results showed that in non-activated macrophage cells, ZIP exposure initiated macrophage spreading; increased cellular proliferation, as evaluated by MTT and flow cytometry assays; and presented higher levels of oxidant molecules involved in the inflammatory response (nitric oxide, superoxide, reactive oxygen species), and proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, TNF alpha, INF gamma). Levels of IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine were lower in ZIP-exposed cells. These effects were less potent than those caused by the positive control for inflammation induction (phytohemagglutinin), and more intense than the effects of lithium (LI), which was used as an anti-inflammatory molecule. ZIP also modulated cytokine gene expression. Taken together, these data suggest that ZIP can produce a peripheral inflammatory response, and this response may explain the allergen-inflammatory response observed in some patients treated with this antipsychotic drug.

AB Diagnosis of complex disease and response to treatment is often associated with multiple indicators, both clinical and laboratorial. With the use of biomarkers, various mechanisms have been unraveled which can lead to better and faster diagnosis, predicting and monitoring of response to treatment and new drug development. With the introduction of multiplex technology for immunoassays and the growing awareness of the role of immune-monitoring during new therapeutic interventions it is now possible to test large numbers of soluble mediators in small sample volumes. However, standardization of sample collection and laboratory assessments remains suboptimal.
   We developed a multiplex immunoassay for detection of 162 immune related proteins in human serum and plasma. The assay was split in panels depending on natural occurring concentrations with a maximum of 60 proteins. The aim of this study was to evaluate precision, accuracy, reproducibility and stability of proteins when repeated freeze-thaw cycles are performed of this in-house developed panel, as well as assessing the protein signature in plasma and serum using various anticoagulants.
   Intra-assay variance of each mediator was < 10%. Inter-assay variance ranged between 1.6 and 37% with an average of 12.2%. Recoveries were similar for all mediators (mean 99.8 +/- 2.6%) with a range between 89-107%. Next we measured all mediators in serum, EDTA plasma and sodium heparin plasma of 43 healthy control donors. Of these markers only 19 showed similar expression profiles in the 3 different matrixes. Only 5 mediators were effected by multiple freeze-thawing cycles. Principal component analysis revealed different coagulants cluster separately and that sodium heparin shows the most consistent profile.

AB Investigations of cellular responses involved in injury and repair processes have generated valuable information contributing to the advancement of wound healing and treatments. Infra-and extracellular regulators of healing mechanisms, such as cytokines, signaling proteins, and growth factors, have been described to possess significant roles in facilitating optimal recovery. This study explored a collection of 30 spatiotemporal responses comprised of cytokines (IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-2, IL-6, TNF-alpha, MIP-1 alpha), intracellular proteins (Akt, c-Jun, CREB, ERK1/2, JNK, MEKI, p38, p53, p90RSK), phosphorylated proteins (p-Akt, p-c-Jun, p-CREB, p-ERK1/2, p-GSK-3 alpha/1 beta, p-HSP27, p-I kappa B alpha, p-JNK, p-MEK1, p-p38, p-p70S6K, p-p90RSK, p-STAT2, p-STAT3), and a protease (Caspase-3), measured in skeletal muscle tissue following a traumatic injury (rodent Gustilo IIIB fracture). To optimize the analysis of context-specific data sets, a network centrality parameter approach was used to assess the impact of each response in relation to all other measured responses. This approach identified proteins that were substantially amplified and potentially central in the wound healing network by evaluation of their corresponding centrality parameter, radiality. Network analysis allowed us to distinguish the progression of healing that occurred at certain time points and regions of injury. Notably, new tissue formation was proposed to occur by 168 h postinjury in severely injured tissue, while tissue 1-cm away from the site of injury that experienced relatively minor injury appeared to exhibit signs of new tissue formation as early as 24 h post-injury. In particular, hallmarks of inflammation, cytokines IL-1 beta, IL-6, and IL-2, appear to have a pronounced impact at earlier time points (0-24 h post-injury), while intracellular proteins involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, or proteolysis (c-Jun, CREB, JNK, p38, p-c-Jun; p-MEK1, p-p38, p-STAT3) are more significant at later times (24-168 h). Overall, this study demonstrates the feasibility of a network analysis approach to extract significant information and also offers a spatiotemporal visualization of the intra- and extracellular signaling responses that regulate healing mechanisms.

AB Background: Multitransfused thalassemic individuals are at high risk of developing transfusion transmitted Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The aim of the study was to correlate the effects of host cytokine single nucleotide polymorphisms of TNF-alpha (-308 A/G) and IFN-gamma (+ 874 A/T) in spontaneous or IFN induced treatment response in the HCV infected thalassemic individuals.
   Methods: A total of 427 HCV sero-reactive thalassemic individuals were processed for HCV viral genomic diversity and host gene polymorphisms analysis of TNF-alpha (-308 A/G) and IFN-gamma (+ 874 A/T).
   Results: Out of 427 HCV sero-reactive individuals, 69.09% were found to be HCV RNA positive with genotype 3 as the predominant infecting strain (94.29%). Study highlighted that, A allele was significantly associated with (p < .05) spontaneous clearance of HCV infection and G allele was correlated with viral persistence at TNF-alpha (- 308) gene polymorphism. Whereas in case of IFN-gamma (+ 874) SNPs, A allele was significantly responsible (p < .05) for spontaneous clearance than T allele. Our study also indicated that in relapsed cases, IFN-gamma (+ 874) T allele is more responsible than A allele. Though no significant correlation was found at both TNF-alpha (- 308) and IFN-gamma (+ 874) gene polymorphism among SVR and relapsed thalassemic patients.
   Conclusion: A allele at both TNF-alpha (- 308) and IFN-gamma (+ 874) were strongly associated with spontaneous clearance among this population. But in case of SVR and relapsed cases no significant association was found. This cytokine gene polymorphisms pattern will help clinicians to take an informed decision about therapeutic management of HCV infected thalassemic individuals.

AB As a complex disease, multiple sclerosis (MS) susceptibility implicates many genetic and environmental factors. Usually, individual genetic association studies have several limitations, and results are specific to the population of study. The Meta-analysis approach has been proposed to resolve these limitations and to increase the power of statistical analyses. In this review, we summarize results from meta-analyses of candidate genes of MS. Using the keywords: multiple sclerosis, genetic polymorphism and meta-analysis, we searched electronic databases (PubMed, Embase and Web of Sciences) for published meta-analyses until May 2017. Meta-analyses confirmed the association of polymorphisms in fifteen candidate genes with MS disease. However, polymorphisms in fourteen genes showed none significant association. Results outlined the importance of confirmed genes to understand signaling pathways in MS disease and shed light on their utility to develop new drugs targets.

ID INSULIN-RESISTANCE; LIPID-METABOLISM; GROWTH-FACTOR; GLUCOSE
AB Objective: Fetuin B is an adipokine/hepatokine which is significantly elevated in insulin resistance/type 2 diabetes mellitus and hepatic steatosis. Regulation of fetuin B in patients with lipodystrophy (LD) - a disease group which is characterized by subcutaneous adipose tissue loss, hypertriglyceridemia, hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance , and dysregulation of several adipokines - has not been elucidated so far.
   Material and methods: Serum fetuin B levels were determined in 37 patients with LD, as well as in a control cohort consisting of 37 non-LD participants matched for age, gender, and body mass index. Furthermore, fetuin B was correlated with parameters of lipid metabolism, glucose control, renal function, and inflammation.
   Results: Median fetuin B serum levels were not significantly different between patients with LD (2980.7 mu g/l; interquartile range: 841.7 mu g/l) and non-LD controls (2647.3 mu g/l; interquartile range: 923.6 mu g/l; p = .105). Fetuin B was associated with age, body mass index, markers of renal function, and C reactive protein (CRP) in univariate correlation analyses. The associations with age and creatinine remained significant in multiple linear regression analysis.
   Conclusions: Fetuin B serum concentrations are not significantly different between patients with LD and non-LD controls. Fetuin B does not seem to be a major pathogenetic factor in LD.

AB IL-6 has been proposed to favor the development of Th2 responses and play an important role in the communication between cells of multicellular organisms. They are involved in the regulation of complex cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation and act as key player during inflammation and immune response. Th2 cytokines play an immunoregulatory role in early infection. Literature says in mice infected with L. major, IL-6 may promote the development of both Thl and Th2 responses. IL-4 is also considered to be the signature cytokine of Th-2 response. IL-10 was initially characterized as a Th2 cytokine but later on it was proved to be a pleiotropic cytokine, secreted from different cell types including the macrophages. A major challenge is to understand how these complex non-linear processes are connected and regulated. Systems biology approaches may be used to tackle this challenge in an iterative process of quantitative mathematical analysis. In this study, we created an in silico model of IL6 mediated macrophage activation which suffers from an excessive impact of the negative feedback loop involving SOCS3. The strategy adopted in this framework may help to reduce the complexity of the leishmanial IL6 model analysis and also laydown various physiological or pathological conditions of IL6 signaling in future.

AB Cytokine assays of host immune responses to vaccination can indicate vaccine efficacy. Here we tested the hypothesis that assays of the cytokine status of infected individuals prior to therapeutic vaccination might provide a guide to vaccine therapeutic efficacy. If so, cytokine analysis might be used to select appropriate patients for therapeutic vaccination. Data were obtained from a panel of 14 cytokine/chemokine assays that were done during a phase III clinical trial of HBsAg-HBIG therapeutic vaccine (YIC) treatment of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients. Summarized assay results were compared between patients who responded by HBeAg-seroconversion and non-responders. Though no single cytokine or chemokine showed clear correlation with responsiveness, by bio-mathematical analysis with Boolean modelling, the combined results revealed that plasma IL-10, IL-33 and MIP-1 alpha together correlated best with responsiveness. However, the difference between HBeAg seroconverted and non-converted YIC-treated CHB patients was maximized when results of all 14 cytokine/chemokine assays were included and showed a sensitivity around 0.59, and a specificity of 0.8. It suggested that the combined analysis of these elements may be useful to screen appropriate CHB patients for therapeutic vaccination with YIC.

AB The connection between chronic inflammation and risk of cancer has been supported by several studies. The development of cancer might be a process driven by the presence of a specific combination of inflammatory mediators, including cytokines, chemokines and enzymes, in the tumor microenvironment. Virus-induced tumors , like HPV-induced Squamous Cell Carcinomas, represent a paradigmatic example of the interplay between inflammation, as integral part of the innate antiviral response, and malignant transformation. Here, the role of inflammatory microenvironment in the HPV-induced carcinogenesis is addressed, with a specific focus on the involvement of the immune molecules as well as their delivery through the microvesicle cargo possibly correlated to the different HPV genotype.
   The expression of the inflammatory mediators in HPV positive cells has been analyzed in primary human foreskin keratinocytes and keratinocytes transduced by E6 and E7 from mucosal HPV-16 or cutaneous HPV-38 genotypes. HPV E6 and E7 proteins can modulate the expression of immune mediators in HPV-infected cells and can affect the levels of immune molecules, mainly chemokines, in the extracellular milieu. HPV-16 E6 and E7 oncoproteins have been silenced to confirm the specificity of the modulation of the inflammatory micro-environment.
   Our results suggest that the expression of HPV oncoproteins allows the modification of the tumor milieu through the synthesis and release of specific pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, affecting the efficacy of the immune response. The microenvironment can also be conditioned by an altered mRNA cargo delivered by extracellular vesicles, thereby efficiently affecting the surrounding cells with possible implication for tumor-igenesis and tumor diagnosis.

AB Using molecular dynamics simulation, the research obtained the thermodynamic properties and microstructures of the mixture of N-octylpyridinium tetrafluoroborate and acetonitrile, including density, self-diffusion coefficients, excess properties, radial distribution functions (RDFs) and spatial distribution functions (SDFs). Both RDFs and SDFs indicate that the local microstructure of the polar region is different from the nonpolar region with different mole fraction of ionic liquids. Acetonitrile could increase the order of the polar regions. While with acetonitrile increasing, the orderliness of the nonpolar region increases firstly and then decreases. In relatively dilute solution, ionic liquids were dispersed to form small aggregates wrapped by acetonitrile. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The resolution-of-the-identity approximation (RI) is a standard tool to accelerate the evaluation of two electron repulsion integrals. However introducing further approximations on top of for example RIMP2, makes it important to check again the made choices. Usually the so called Coulomb metric is used. An alternative is the less accurate overlap metric, which has the benefit of a faster decay with distance. We encountered both choices in our atomic batched tensor decomposed MP2 (AB-MP2) and went with the Coulomb metric for the safe choice. In this work we re-investigate the choice of Coulomb and overlap metric for RI-MP2 and AB-MP2. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We present the first potential energy surface (PES) for the AlO(X-2 Sigma(+))-He(S-1) van der Waals complex. This PES has been calculated at the RCCSD(T) level of theory. The mixed Gaussian/Exponential Extrapolation Scheme of complete basis set [CBS(D, T, Q)] was employed. The PES was fitted using global analytical method. This fitted PES was used subsequently in the close-coupling approach for the computation of the state-to-state collisional excitation cross sections of the fine-structure levels of the AlO-He complex. Collision energies were taken up to 2500 cm(-1) and they yield after thermal averaging, state-to-state rate coefficients up to 300 K. The propensity rules between the lowest fine-structure levels were studied. These rules show, on one hand, a strong propensity in favour of odd Delta N transitions, and on the other hand, that cross sections and collisional rate coefficients for Delta j = Delta N transitions are larger than those for Delta j not equal Delta N transitions.

AB In this letter, we discussed the plausible formation of [Au11Re] as a superatom with an electronic structure accounted by the 1S(2)1P(6)1D(10) shell order, denoting similar stability to [W@Au-12]. The possible hollow or endohedral structures show a variable HOMO-LUMO gap according to the given structure (from 0.33 to 1.30 eV, at the PBE/ZORA level). Our results show that the energy minimum is an endohedral arrangement, where Re is encapsulated in a D-3h-Au-11 cage, retaining a higher gold-dopant stoichiometric ratio. This approach is useful for further rationalization and design of novel superatoms expanding the libraries of endohedral clusters. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We analyze the effects of dielectric decrement and finite ion size in an aqueous electrolyte on the capacitance of a graphene electrode, and make comparisons with the effects of dielectric saturation combined with finite ion size. We first derive conditions for the cross-over from a camel-shaped to a bell-shaped capacitance of the diffuse layer. We show next that the total capacitance is dominated by a V-shaped quantum capacitance of graphene at low potentials. A broad peak develops in the total capacitance at high potentials, which is sensitive to the ion size with dielectric saturation, but is stable with dielectric decrement. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB In general cases, carotenoid aggregates are prepared in organic-water mixing solvent depending on its hydrophobic character. It is well-known that one of carotenoids, lycopene, is more likely to form typical H-aggregates. In this study, new type lycopene J-aggregates were prepared in DMSO-water mixing solvent with small amount of toluene, which was observed for the first time. We proposed a potential structure model combining with exciton model to interpret the mechanism of spectra changes. Our finding has provided new methods and novel ideas for controlling carotenoid aggregates formation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Chemometric tools were applied to investigate the biological behaviour of ampholytic substances in relation to their physicochemical and spectral properties. Results of the Principal Component Analysis suggest that size of molecules and their electronic and spectral characteristics are the key properties required to predict therapeutic relevance of the compounds examined. These properties were used for developing the structure-activity classification model. The classification model allows assessing the therapeutic behaviour of ampholytic substances on the basis of solely values of descriptors that can be obtained computationally. Thus, the prediction is possible without necessity of carrying out time-consuming and expensive laboratory tests, which is its main advantage. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is considered as one of the most favored drug targets for Alzheimer's disease. The effects of different force fields (FFs) on ranking affinity of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors were obtained using the fast pulling of ligand (FPL) method in steered-molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations. GROMOS, AMBER, CHARMM, and OPLS-AA FFs were investigated in this work. The pulling work derived with GROMOS FF has the strongest correlation and smallest error compared with experimental binding affinity. Moreover, the CPU consumption in the calculations using GROMOS FF is the lowest, which could allow us to rank affinity of a large number of AChE ligands. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB It is becoming increasingly apparent that changes in the higher-order structure of genome-sized DNA molecules of more than several tens kbp play important roles in the self-control of genome activity in living cells. Unfortunately, it has been rather difficult to prepare genome-sized DNA molecules without damage or fragmentation. Here, we evaluated the degree of double-strand breaks (DSBs) caused by mechanical mixing by single-molecule observation with fluorescence microscopy. The results show that DNA breaks are most significant for the first second after the initiation of mechanical agitation. Based on such observation, we propose a novel mixing procedure to significantly decrease DSBs. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Spin contamination error in the total energy of the Au-2/MgO system was estimated using the density functional theory/plane-wave scheme and approximate spin projection methods. This is the first investigation in which the errors in chemical phenomena on a periodic surface are estimated. The spin contamination error of the system was 0.06 eV. This value is smaller than that of the dissociation of Au-2 in the gas phase (0.10 eV). This is because of the destabilization of the singlet spin state due to the weakening of the Au-Au interaction caused by the Au-MgO interaction. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Photoinduced electron transfer from gold nanoparticles (NPs) to semiconductor under plasmon excitation is an important phenomenon in photocatalysis and solar cell applications. Femtosecond plasmoninduced electron transfer from gold NPs to the conduction band of different semiconductor like TiO2, SnO2, and ZnO was monitored at 3440 nm upon optical excitation of the surface plasmon band of gold NPs. It was found that electron injection was completed within 240 fs and the electron injection yield reached 10-30% under 570 nm excitation. It means TiO2 is not the only proper semiconductor as electron acceptors in such gold/semiconductor nanoparticle systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Four carbon allotropes built from tetrahedral symmetrical fullerenes C-28 and C-40 are predicted to be superhard materials with mass density around that of water, and all of them are porous semiconductors. Both the bandgaps and hardness decrease with increasing ratio of sp(2) hybridized carbon atoms. The mechanical and thermodynamic stabilities of C-28- and C-40-based allotropes at zero pressure are confirmed by a variety of state-of-the-art theoretical calculations. The evolution trend of bandgap found here suggests that one can obtain low-density hard materials with tunable bandgaps by substituting the carbon atom in diamond with different T-d-symmetrical non-IPR fullerene C-n.

AB Sodium zirconophosphosilicates (Na1+xZr2(P1-xSixO4)(3) (0 < x < 3)) currently experience a kind of renaissance as promising ceramic electrolytes for safe all-solid-state Na batteries. Such energy storage systems are an emerging option for next-generation technologies with attractive cost due to the use of abundant elements as sodium. To identify the right candidates their ion transport properties need to be precisely studied. In many cases less is known about the contributions of blocking grain boundaries to the overall charge carrier transport. Here, we took advantage of broadband impedance and conductivity spectroscopy carried out at sufficiently low temperature to make visible these two contributions for polycrystalline Na3Zr2(SiO4)(2)PO4. It turned out that ion transport across the grain boundaries of a sintered pellet do not greatly hinder long-range ion dynamics. While bulk ion dynamics in Na3Zr2(SiO4)(2)PO4 is characterized by 1.0 mS cm (1), the grain boundary ionic conductivity is only slightly lower viz. 0.7 mS cm (1). The latter value is of large practical interest as it allows the realization of all-solid-state Na batteries without strong interfering resistances from grain boundaries. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB The ethylamine cation CH3CH2NH2+ is shown to loose CH3 accompanied by a bimodal kinetic energy release. CH3CH2NH2+ exists in two conformeric forms, which are computationally shown to be distinct minima. The barrier separating the conformers is modest compared to the energy requirement for dissociation, and the conformers are so easily interconverted that the reactions take place from a mixture of the two conformers in equilibrium. However, once a reaction begins it is conformer-specific. The reaction from one conformational origin takes place by simple cleavage along a one-dimensional reaction coordinate, whereas reaction from the other origin is by a complex reaction mechanism with a two-or possibly three-dimensional reaction coordinate. Reaction by the former mechanism is a statistical process associated with a low kinetic energy release (KER), while the latter is non-statistical giving rise to a very low KER. The experimental result is a composite signal due to the superposition of two simple Gaussians, each corresponding to their respective KER. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study was carried out to analyze the land use suitability of Golestan Province, located in the northeast of Iran, for rainfed farming performance using Geographic Information System (GIS) and Multi-criteria Decision-making Analysis (MCDA) in 2016. First, thematic maps of several environmental variables including soil, climate and topographic variables were obtained. After preparing the raster layers, the environmental requirements of rainfed farming were identified from a comprehensive literature review and asking local experts' opinions; then they were classified according to FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN) requirements. In the next step, AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process)-acquired weights were assigned to the criteria. Then, digital layers were overlaid using Weighted Overlay Analysis (WOA) in ArcGIS. According to the results of land suitability analysis, development of rainfed farming is possible for up to 56 percent of the current land of Golestan Province (about 396,550.5 ha) in the southern and central areas as a long belt from east to west. The results showed that some climatic variables such as temperature, annual rainfall, and sunshine hours were not limiting factors for rainfed farming in this region. However, other environmental variables such as salinity, organic matter, soil erosion, soil texture classes, and the autumn, spring, May and June rainfalls were identified as limiting factors for rainfed farming performance in the northern and northeastern regions of Golestan Province. We also found that slope was a limiting cause in the southern part of this province. Generally, the use of specific management practices such as increasing soil organic matter, saline reduction of lands, conservation tillage, and supplementary irrigation canimprove the quality class of low capability lands to higher suitability classes and increase the quality of environmental resources.

AB Management of industrial sludge is a big challenge for developing countries. Composting is an economical and viable option to manage and treat an industrial sludge. However, efficient compost production requires nature of materials involved, process understanding and physics behind the process. We investigated the physical parameters during composting of solid pulp and paper mill sludge in 550 L rotary drum composter. Variation in physical parameters such as bulk density, volatile solids, moisture content, free air space, void ratio, ash content and particle density were analyzed over the period of composting. Bulk density was observed increasing, whereas free air space was showed declining trend and observed 52% in end compost. The particle density was observed to be increasing from 610 to 680 kg m(-3). End compost was analyzed for nutritional parameters and seen to be increasing over the period of composting. A strong relationship was found between various physical parameters. Pearson's correlation coefficient matrix was formed between free air space, bulk density, moisture content and particle density.

AB Direct seeding is a potential technique to restore forests; however, further studies are needed before its application on a large scale. We carried out a field experiment in a deforested area in southern Brazil to test the technical and economic feasibility of a direct seeding system with high tree species diversity to restore the tropical seasonal forest. We also compared species performances and tested the effects of seed size and successional group on tree seedling emergence and development. The trial was established at two different sowing times using 31 tree species. For two years after sowing we evaluated seedling emergence, establishment, survival and early growth of tree species, weed competition and costs for plantation establishment and early maintenance. Most species had low seedling emergence and establishment, but high survival rates, implying that low seedling emergence is the main barrier to community assembly that must be overcome. The most successful species had larger seeds, belonged to non-pioneer categories and had slower growth rates. Final costs after two years were lower than has been reported in the literature for most restoration planting using seedlings both in Brazil and elsewhere; however, seedling density was low. Although direct seeding may be a feasible alternative to decrease planting costs, the poor species performances and low seedling density may reduce its applicability. Thus, we recommend direct seeding only in association with the planting of pioneer species seedlings.

AB During 2013-2014 period, the surface renewal (SR) - energy balance (EB) method combined with the water balance approach was adopted to define the energy and water budget of a treatment wetland (TW) in Eastern Sicily (Italy). The main objective was to evaluate the differences between energy and water balances and understand the underlining mechanisms of environmental control. Results shown that the seasonal variation in evapotranspiration (ET) had similar trend as the seasonal variation of leaf area index (LAI) and net radiation (R-n). During the study period, the daily rate of ET by EB ranged from -0.1 mm d(-1) to 9.3 mm d(-1), with a total ET of about 1837 mm in 17 months. The crop coefficient K-c (e.g. obtained using the FAO-56 mean K-c approach) for the TW ranged from 0.5 to 2.4, with a mean annual value of 1.24. On a 10-day mean basis, ET fluxes from the TW water balance were 15% higher than ET by EB.

AB Green roofs provide ecological benefits to urban areas and the use of biodiverse communities enables the vegetation to recover from stress caused by dry conditions. Recycled waste materials are often used as substrates and extensive research on their physical and chemical properties has been carried out. In this study, we evaluated different amounts of deinking sludge pellets as an alternative substrate component in establishing drought-tolerant herbaceous communities on green roofs. Three substrates were prepared aimed at providing decreasing fertility: a commercial substrate composed of tephra and compost (control); an experimental substrate composed of tephra, pellets, and compost, and another one consisting of tephra and pellets. A mixture of 30 species, including native herbaceous species and sedum, of Mediterranean phytocenosis, was transplanted on all the substrates. A physical and chemical characterization of the substrates was carried out. The plant ecological functionality, life forms and richness, and the abundance of flower-visiting insects were studied. The substrate composition affected the plant community cover and richness. The amount of pellets in the two experimental substrates reduced the availability of resources (nitrogen and moisture content) promoting diversity, in terms of the number of species, as well as the hardiness of the vegetation. Our results are of great interest for obtaining a biodiverse mosaic habitat in green infrastructures, by measuring out the quantity of infertile materials in the substrates.

AB Tea factory waste (TFW) is a difficult-to-degrade and fibrous waste material generated in tonnes during tea manufacturing. Though TFW contains high amount of nutrients; high phenolic compound content and fibrous nature limit its direct use in agriculture. In this study, TFW was mixed with cattle manure at different proportions for evaluating possibility of recycling TFW through vermicomposting. It was observed that earthworms (Eudrilus euginae used in this study) could only survive when TFW was mixed with cattle manure at least in 1:1 proportion (w/w basis). The quality of vermicompost prepared from 25% TFW and 75% cattle manure combination was comparable to the vermicompost of sole cattle manure. Phosphorus (P) is one of the major nutrients required for plant growth. Though the effect of phosphatase enzyme in P mineralization during vermicomposting is well established, phytase enzyme in the vermicomposted organic substrate was not quantified before. In this study, phytase enzyme, measured in vermicomposting materials, was positively related to the amount of P mineralized. Both acid phosphatase and phytase enzymes were responsible for P-mineralization during vermicomposting. It was observed that acid phosphatase enzyme contributed to the P-mineralization in the first 50 days, while phytase enzyme contributed in the latter part of vermicomposting.

AB We measured plant community composition and productivity, soil accretion, and C, N, and P burial in a tidal freshwater forest of the Altamaha River, Georgia to gain a better understanding of the ecosystem services they deliver and their ability to keep pace with current and future rates of sea level rise. Ten species were identified in two 0.1 ha plots. Nyssa aquatica (Tupelo Gum) made up 50% of the density and 57% of the total basal area. Nyssa biflora, Liquidambar styraciflua, and Fraxinus pennsylvanica were the next dominant species, collectively accounting for 37% of the density and 26% of the total basal area. Taxodium distichum only accounted for 3% of the density, but 12% of the total basal area. Aboveground productivity, measured as litterfall and stem wood growth, averaged 927 and 1030 g/m(2) in 2015 and 2016, respectively, with litterfall accounting for 60% of the total. Tidal forest soils in the streamside and the interior (0-60 cm) contained 3-6% organic C, 0.20-0.40% N, and 270-540 mu g/g P. Soil accretion based on Cs-137 was 4.0 mm/year on the streamside and 0.2 mm/year in the forest interior. The rate of accretion in the interior is considerably less than the current rate of sea level rise (3.1 mm/year) along the Georgia coast. Because the accretion rate was much higher on the streamside, rates of C sequestration, N and P accumulation, and mineral sediment deposition also were much greater. Low accretion rates in the interior of the forest that accounts for most of the acreage suggests that accelerated sea level rise is likely to lead to foreseeable death of tidal forests from saltwater intrusion and submergence.

AB Hyporheic exchange between a river channel and its floodplain region assists in mediating processes such as nutrient removal and temperature regulation. Floodplain restoration in the form of levee setbacks are often carried out to improve the hyporheic exchange. In this study Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data were used along with the head data from observation wells and stage data from rivers to setup and calibrate a groundwater model for 458 km(2) of area within Gap to Gap reach of the Yakima River, WA. This area has witnessed several efforts of floodplain restoration in the form of levee setbacks. The groundwater model was used to quantify hyporheic flow emerging from the Yakima River in steady and transient states during pre-restoration (using LiDAR data of 2008) and post-restoration period (after levee setback using LiDAR data of 2013). The comparison of results from the model runs during pre and post-restoration periods showed that the length of the pathlines increased after levee setback for both steady and transient state model simulations. The largest increase of about 62 m was noticed in the month of September 2014 (pre: 398 m and post: 460 m). The study also showed that the direction of the flow changed following levee setback, expanding the area for hyporheic flux exchange between surface and groundwater. The model run during transient state also suggested that pathlines were longer during drier months compared to wet months. Overall, the study showed that levee setbacks improved the hyporheic connection between surface and groundwater in the Yakima floodplain which demonstrates that levee setback can provide a valuable hydrologic tool to restore ecosystem processes in previously leveed rivers.

AB Groundwater constitutes the principal source of drinking water in Europe but the increase of urbanized impervious surfaces reduced the natural recharge of aquifers. To bypass this problem, infiltration systems have been largely developed for groundwater recharge. Nevertheless, the hydraulic performance of these systems is often altered by physical and biological clogging. The present study aimed to experimentally quantify the impact of a grazer (Viviparus viviparus) on hydraulic conductivity of three infiltration basins differentially clogged by benthic algal mat. The influence of the gastropod was also measured on the physical (proportion of silt and clay particles) and biological (algal biomass, bacteria abundance, total organic carbon, gross photosynthetic and hydrolytic activities) of the top layer of the infiltration media. We expected that grazers would have the highest influence on hydraulic performance of basin presenting the highest algal biomass. Our results showed that: (i) the grazers had a positive influence on hydraulic conductivity in the three basins; (ii) these positive effects were not significantly influenced by the initial conditions (algal biomass) in the three basins; and (iii) the impact of the grazers on hydraulic conductivity was not restricted to the removal of biofilm biomass by trophic action but may be also associated with bioturbation activities (pelletization and sediment reworking of the top sediment layer). While management practices developed to improve hydraulic performance of infiltration basins mainly focus on costly and non-environmentally friendly actions (e.g. mechanical sediment scraping), this study highlights the opportunity to consider alternative ecological solutions using the trophic and/or the bioturbation activities of animals.

AB Suspended vegetation can disturb flow, thereby affecting mass transportation. Although theoretical study of longitudinal dispersion in suspended vegetated flows may be complex, physical factors influencing longitudinal dispersion are well known. The key studying longitudinal dispersion is to obtain time-averaged longitudinal velocity distribution and lateral diffusion coefficient. A four-zone model, which includes the four-zone velocity profile and the four-zone turbulent diffusion coefficient profile, is proposed in this study to incorporate with the random displacement model (RDM) to simulate solute transport in suspended vegetated flows. Considering that the experimental results are measured at the early stage of the longitudinal dispersion, the downstream distance between the instrument and the release position should be considered to determine the longitudinal dispersion coefficient rather than directly using the asymptotic value. Then simulation results are obtained, which are consistent with those data measured in the experiments. In addition, this study confirms that the suspended vegetation can increase Fickian time, that is, it will take longer time for the longitudinal dispersion coefficient to reach stable. Finally, sensitivity analysis proves that the model has good stability.

AB Culverts are instream structures that act as hydrological barriers to fish movement by altering water turbulence, increasing water velocities and disrupting connectivity. Hydrological barriers like culverts have led to the fragmentation and decline of freshwater fish populations worldwide. Culvert remediation strategies such as bed roughening have proved effective at increasing the likelihood of fish passage in a variety of fish species. However, little is known about whether culvert roughening is efficacious for Australian small bodied fishes and if so, whether bed roughening is comparably beneficial to all species that may utilise remediated culverts. This study assessed the effect of roughened bed substrates on the swimming performance and behaviour of four small bodied or juvenile Australian fishes (Hypseleotris compressa and Melanotaenia duboulayi, and juvenile Tandanus tandanus and Maccullochella peelii) that exist in sympatry over parts of their distribution. Results showed that bed roughening increased water turbulence and the size of low velocity regions within fluid flow and that all fish species displayed the same positive behavioural preferences for these zones. However, the effect of bed roughening on swimming endurance and traversability was found to only benefit Mel. duboulayi and Mac. peelii. Roughening decreased endurance and traversability in T. tandanus, and had no effect on performance in H. compressa. These data indicate that sympatric species may respond differently to culvert remediation actions, highlighting the need for a holistic approach to culvert remediation and a comprehensive understanding of all species' requirements within the affected environment.

AB Along many streams, natural riparian vegetation has been replaced by agricultural fields or plantations resulting in ecosystem alterations due to changes of the interactions across the land-water ecotone. We studied the effect of restoration interventions by removing a dense spruce plantation in a 25 m wide zone along a 4 km section of a headwater stream. Water discharge, nutrient and total organic carbon concentrations were unaffected by the intervention, which only involved 0.7% of the catchment area. Focusing on the oxygen dynamics within several sections of the stream revealed that the stream water was generally oxygen under-saturated both before and after the restoration reflecting the dominance of heterotrophy over photoautotrophy typical of small streams. Oxygen saturation was tightly coupled to water discharge, with anoxia or hypoxia developing during low summer flow, and levels just below saturation during high autumn-spring flow at low temperature and low metabolism. Stream-near felling increased incident irradiance and reduced the duration and extent of summer hypoxia despite unaltered discharge, temperature and concentration of total organic carbon. Increased incident irradiance was accompanied by higher oxygen saturation in open sections compared to control sections with intact tree cover. Diel oxygen changes followed incident irradiance during low summer flow, while alterations at high winter flow were caused by changes in temperature-dependent oxygen solubility and high reaeration. In conclusion, we show that anoxic or hypoxic oxygen levels occur in warm, low-flow summer periods and this stress is reduced when intense shading from spruce plantation is removed and in-stream oxygen production is stimulated.

AB Phytoextraction field trials with Noccaea caerulescens were conducted in Brussels (Belgium) to investigate the benefits of nitrogen fertilization and planting density on phytoextraction efficiency. Both metallicolous (Ganges) and non-metallicolous (NMET, Luxembourg) populations were grown for 6 months in an urban wasteland and in a vegetable garden contaminated with trace metals at two planting densities (50 and 100 plants.m(-2), D50 and D100), with and without mineral nitrogen fertilizers. Trials showed that N. caerulescens responded positively to nitrogen fertilization through increased biomass production. However due to lower concentrations in Cd and Zn in fertilized plants, the total metal uptake was differently impacted by fertilization: on one site metal uptake was enhanced while on the other it was reduced. Moreover fertilization had collateral effects as enhancing fungal pathogen development. The effect of planting density of N. caerulescens assessed in this work for the first time highlighted a clear competition between individuals at higher density - proved by lower individual biomass but the highest metal uptake was nevertheless achieved at the highest density of 100 plants.m(-2) because of higher total biomass. Six months after harvest soil exchangeable concentrations were reduced by about 25% for Cd with Ganges population and by 9% for Zn with the NMET population on the best treatment (N fertilized and D100). The feasibility of using N. caerulescens for bioavailable contaminant stripping of moderately contaminated soils was confirmed for Cd and to a lesser extent for Zn.

AB The introduction of nanoparticles into biological fluids often leads to the formation of biocorona over the surface of nanoparticles. For the effective use of nanoparticles in biological applications it is very essential to understand their interactions with proteins. Herein, we investigated the interactions of Poly ethylene glycol capped Ag2S nanoparticles with Bovine Serum Albumin by spectroscopic techniques. By the addition of Ag2S nanoparticles, a ground state complex is formed. The CD spectroscopy reveals that the secondary structure of BSA is altered by complexation with PEG-Ag2S nanoparticles, while the overall tertiary structure remains closer to that of native BSA.

AB Two-photon absorption (TPA) cross sections of conjugated donor-it-acceptor dipolar structures containing benzothiazole or benzobisthiazolium moieties are determined in a broad spectral range from 700 nm to 1000 nm using two-photon induced fluorescence technique. The TPA cross section values range from 150 GM to 4600 GM. The largest values are observed in near-infrared region. The dipolar derivative of benzothiazole has the largest TPA cross section of 4600 GM at wavelength of 890 nm. A combination of the large TPA in the near-infrared region and the high emission quantum yield makes these compounds excellent candidates for two-photon fluorescence microscopy.

AB Water is often found in (micro)-heterogeneous environments and therefore it is necessary to understand their H-bonded network structure in such altered environments. We explore the structure and dynamics of water in its binary mixture with relatively less polar small biocompatible amphiphilic molecule 1,2-Dimethoxyethane (DME) by a combined spectroscopic and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation study. Picosecond (ps) resolved fluorescence spectroscopy using coumarin 500 as the fluorophore establishes a non-monotonic behaviour of the mixture. Simulation studies also explore the various possible H-bond formations between water and DME. The relative abundance of such different water species manifests the heterogeneity in the mixture.

AB Cu2O/TiO2 nanopowders were prepared and used as thin film electrode raw materials for CO2 photoelectroreduction. Characterization results from XRD, TEM, UV-Vis and BET show that Cu2O/TiO2 composites have regular morphology, narrow band gap, excellent textural properties, and exhibits marked response of visible light. The photoelectrocatalytic results show that CO2 can be reduced to formaldehyde (i.e., intermediate) and finally methanol (i.e., end product). In addition, the CO2 photoelectroreduction pathway and the mechanism of photoelectrocatalysis are discussed. In summary, the work reports a potential method of CO2 reduction by visible-light photocatalysis without an external bias. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Following a green synthesis method, zinc sulfide (ZnS) nanoparticles were prepared by chemical co-precipitation technique using starch as capping agent. Microwave irradiation was used as heating source. X-ray diffraction studies indicated that nanopowders obtained were polycrystalline possessing ZnS simple cubic structure. Transmission electron microscopic studies indicated that starch limits the agglomeration by steric stabilization. Interaction between ZnS and starch was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy as well as Raman scattering studies. Quantum size effects were observed in optical absorption studies while quenching of defect states on nanoparticles was improved with increase in starch addition as indicated by photoluminescence spectra.

AB A new global potential energy surface (PES) of the NaH2+ system is constructed by fitting 27,621 ab initio energy points with the neural network method. The root mean square error of the new PES is only 4.1609 x 10 (4) eV. Based on the new PES, dynamical calculations have been performed using the time-dependent quantum wave packet method. These results are then compared with the H(S-2) + LiH+(X-2 Sigma(+)) -> Li+(S-1) + H-2(X-1 Sigma(+)(g)) reaction. The direct abstract mechanism is found to play an important role in the reaction because only forward scattering signals on the differential cross section results for all calculated collision energies.

AB It is demonstrated that the morphology of Co-doped ZnO nanostructures can be easily altered by controlling Co-doping concentration. A facile low-temperature solution method was employed for the nanosynthesis. The morphology of the nanostructures changed from nanorods to nanoparticles, and to needle-like structures as the molar ratio of Co2+ ions increased. No noticeable changes in structural and optical properties were caused by the low concentration of Co-doping, while a magnetic transition was observed. At the very low Co concentrations below 0.3 at%, the nanostructures showed diamagnetism, whereas a paramagnetic behavior was observed at a concentration of 2.5 at%. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB The photocatalytic reduction of CO2 into hydrocarbons provides a promising approach to overcome the challenges of environmental crisis and energy shortage. Here we fabricated a cuprous oxide (Cu2O) based composite photocatalyst consisting of Cu2O/carbon nanoparticles (CNPs). To prepare the CNPs, coal samples from Wucaiwan, Xinjiang, China, were first treated with HNO3, followed by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) oxidation to strip nanocrystalline carbon from coal. After linking with oxygen-containing group such as hydroxyl, coal-based CNPs with sp2 carbon structure and multilayer graphene lattice structure were synthesized. Subsequently, the CNPs were loaded onto the surface of Cu2O nanoparticles prepared by in-situ reduction of copper chloride (CuCl2 center dot 2H(2)O). The physical properties and chemical structure of the Cu2O/CNPs as well as photocatalytic activity of CO2/H2O reduction into CH3OH were measured. The results demonstrate that the Cu2O/CNPs are composed of spherical particles with diameter of 50 nm and mesoporous structure, which are suitable for CO2 adsorption. Under illumination of visible light, electron-hole pairs are generated in Cu2O. Thanks to the CNPs, the fast recombination of electron-hole pairs is suppressed. The energy gradient formed on the surface of Cu2O/CNPs facilitates the efficient separation of electron-hole pairs for CO2 reduction and H2O oxidation, leading to enhanced photocatalytic activity.

AB The multiple energy switching scheme [J. Chem. Phys. 119 (2003) 2596] has been used to improve the double many-body expansion (DMBE II) potential energy surface of C-3 near its linear global minima by morphing it with an accurate Taylor-series expansion [J. Chem. Phys. 144 (2016) 044307]. The final ES form attains the accuracy of the local form in reproducing the rovibrational spectrum of C-3 while keeping unaltered all key attributes of the original DMBE II, namely conical intersection seams and dissociative channels. The ES form is therefore commended for adiabatic spectroscopic and reaction dynamics studies. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Here we report the thermal properties and cycling performance of Ca(BH4)(2)/MgH2. The reaction enthalpy is 48 kJ mol (1) H-2 and equilibrium pressure at 350 degrees C is 0.4981 MPa. We add NbF5 into Ca(BH4)(2)/MgH2 to figure out the degradation mechanism because of its catalytic ability. Ca(BH4)(2)/MgH2 follows the dehydrogenation path to form CaH2, CaB6 and Mg. The degradation of Ca(BH4)(2)/MgH2 composite during cycling is due to the particle aggregation and the reduction of CaB6 product. NbF5 can promote the forming of CaB6 and prevent microstructural coarsening in Ca(BH4)(2)/MgH2 during cycling, which leads to better reversibility. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A general exponential, coupled cluster like, approach is discussed to extract an effective Hamiltonian in configurational space, as a sum of 1-body, 2-body up to n-body operators. The simplest two-body approach is illustrated by calculations on simple magnetic model systems. A key feature of the approach is that equations up to a certain rank do not depend on higher body cluster operators. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Freeze-drying of initially porous frozen material was investigated aimed at improving the process economics by reducing drying time and raising productivity. Experimental results showed that freeze-drying can be significantly enhanced by the frozen material with prebuilt porosity, and about 31% of drying time can be saved compared with the conventionally solid frozen material under the tested operating conditions. A multiphase transport model was formulated based on the local mass non-equilibrium assumption. Numerical results showed excellent agreements between measured and predicted drying curves. Analyses of saturation and temperature profiles displayed that volumetric sublimation-desorption can occur for the initially porous frozen material. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The performance of Kobryn-Gusarov-Kovalenko (KGK) closure was examined in terms of the thermodynamics for one-component Lennard-Jones fluids. The result was compared to molecular dynamics simulation as well as to hypernetted chain, Kovalenko-Hirata (KH), Percus-Yevick and Verlet-modified closures. As the density increases, the error of KGK closure shows a turnover, regarding the excess internal energy, pressure and isothermal compressibility. On the other hand, it was numerically confirmed that the energy and the virial equations are consistent under both KH and KGK closures. The accuracies of density-derivative and temperature-derivative of the radial distribution function are also discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In addition to the usually observed changes in both the reorientation dynamics and size of free volumes at the temperature of melting, T-m, and solid-solid phase transition, T-ss, an additional coincidence between the characteristic ESR and PALS temperatures T-x1(fast) congruent to T-b1(sol)< T-m, T-ss was found. The phenomenological analysis of the viscosity data of n-alkanes using the power law equation indicates a presence of locally disordered regions in which the dynamic change occurs at the crossover temperature T-x congruent to T-x1(fast )congruent to T-b1(sol).

The exfoliation of graphite may originate from the "molecular wedge" effect of urea, which can intercalate into the edge of natural graphite, thus facilitating the production of graphene dispersion with a high concentration up to 1.2 mg/mL. The obtained graphene is non-oxidized with negligible defects. Therefore, this approach has great promise in bulk production of graphene with superior quality for a variety of applications.

AB We systematically investigate the electronic properties the two-dimensional (2D) silicene/GaP heterobilayer by using density functional theory calculations. We find the silicene and GaP monolayer are bounded to each other via orbital hybridization, and the charge redistribution occurring at the silicene/GaP interface leads to the opening of a direct energy band gap of about 0.997 eV in silicene. Importantly, by applying external electric field, the band structure of silicene/GaP heterostructure can be effectively modulated, and a semiconductor-metal transition even emerges. These intriguing properties make the silicene/GaP heterobilayer a promising 2D material for future electronics and strain sensors. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A novel porous cathode of LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3 perovskite with aligned porosities was engineered for solid oxide fuel cells. LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3 was produced through metal nitrate and acid citric combustion method and calcined at different temperatures. The synthesized LNF at 600 degrees C shows specific surface area (S-BET) of 24.4 m(2)g (1) and an average pore size of 12.2 nm. The chemical composition and structure of LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3 synthesized at temperature 600-1400 degrees C, were analyzed by XRD, XPS and HRTEM. SEM observations of freeze cast nano-sized LNF showed the vertically aligned hexagonal walls. These walls contain a great value of fine pores which accelerate the gas transportation.

AB The first electronic transition and adiabatic ionization energies of 3,5-difluorophenol (35DFP) have been identified as 37614 cm (-1) and 72468 cm(-1), respectively. These energy values of 35DFP are marginally higher than those of other positional isomers of difluorophenols (25DFP, 34DFP, and 24DFP). The observed active vibrations are primarily due to the in-plane and out-of-plane ring deformation and substituent-sensitive bending motions in the electronically excited (S-1) and cationic ground (D-0) states.

AB This letter proposes an approximate treatment of the harmonic solvation model (HSM) assuming the solute to be a rigid body (RB-HSM). The HSM method can appropriately estimate the Gibbs free energy for condensed phases even where an ideal gas model used by standard quantum chemical programs fails. The RB-HSM method eliminates calculations for intra-molecular vibrations in order to reduce the computational costs. Numerical assessments indicated that the RB-HSM method can evaluate entropies and internal energies with the same accuracy as the HSM method but with lower calculation costs. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB We present an accurate and efficient real-space Density Functional Theory (DFT) framework for the ab initio study of non-orthogonal crystal systems. Specifically, employing a local reformulation of the electrostatics, we develop a novel Kronecker product formulation of the real-space kinetic energy operator that significantly reduces the number of operations associated with the Laplacian-vector multiplication, the dominant cost in practical computations. In particular, we reduce the scaling with respect to finite-difference order from quadratic to linear, thereby significantly bridging the gap in computational cost between non-orthogonal and orthogonal systems. We verify the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed methodology through selected examples. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Composite plasmonic nanostructures with controlled size, shape and relative arrangement is a subject of significant current research interest. Much of this is stimulated by the prospects by generating enormous near-field enhancements of the surface and interparticle gap regions for potential applications in surface-enhanced spectroscopies. In this manuscript, using time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations, we investigate how the optical response in size matched homodimers and size mismatched heterodimers composed of Aluminum modify while varying the size and interparticle gap distances in the sub-nanometer range. Both systems show interesting optical response evolution. In particular, the size mismatched heterodimers show even more complex optical response evolution due to a symmetry-breaking in the system.

AB Mg is promising as a new light-weight and low-cost hydrogen-storage material. We construct a numerical model to represent the hydrogen dynamics on Mg, comprising dissociative adsorption, desorption, bulk diffusion, and chemical reaction. Our calculation shows a good agreement with experimental data for hydrogen absorption and desorption on Mg. Our model clarifies the evolution of the ratedetermining processes as absorption and desorption proceed. Furthermore, we investigate the optimal condition and materials design for efficient hydrogen storage in Mg. By properly understanding the rate-determining processes using our model, one can determine the design principle for high-performance hydrogen-storage systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this work, two-step method has been employed to prepare random oriented hexagonal hydroxide nanoplates on graphene (Ni(OH)(2)@G) as binder free anode for lithium ion battery (LIB) with high capacity. The morphology, microstructure, crystal phase and elemental bonding have been characterized. When evaluated as anode for LIB, the Ni(OH)(2)@G exhibited high initial discharge capacity of 1318 mAh/g at the current density of 50 mA/g. After 80 cycles, the capacity was maintained at 834 mAh/g, implying 63.3% remaining. Even the charge rate was increased to 2000 mA/g, an impressive capacity of 141 mAh/g can be obtained, indicating good rate capability. The superior LIB behavior of Ni(OH)(2)@G is ascribed to the excellent combination between Ni(OH)(2) nanoplates and graphene via both covalent chemical bonding and van der Waals interactions.

AB We report on experimental total electron scattering cross-section (TCS) from pyridine (C5H5N) for incident electron energies between 10 and 1000 eV, with experimental uncertainties within 5-10%, as measured with a double electrostatic analyser apparatus. The experimental results are compared with our theoretical calculations performed within the independent atom model complemented with a screening corrected additivity rule (IAM-SCAR) procedure which has been updated by including interference effects. A good level of agreement is found between both data sources within the experimental uncertainties. The present TCS results for electron impact energy under study contribute, together with other scattering data available in the literature, to achieve a consistent set of cross section data for modelling purposes.

AB Phosphorene, a two-dimensional material, has been a subject of recent investigations. In the present study, we have prepared blue fluorescent phosphorene quantum dots (PQDs) by liquid phase exfoliation of black phosphorus in two non-polar solvents, toluene and mesitylene. The average particle sizes of PQDs decrease from 5.0 to 1.0 nm on increasing the sonicator power from 150 to 225 W. The photoluminescence spectrum of the PQDs is red-shifted in the 395-470 nm range on increasing the excitation-wavelength from 300 to 480 nm. Electron donor and acceptor molecules quench the photoluminescence, with the acceptors showing more marked effects. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Structure and dynamics of preferential solvation of K(I) ion in aqueous ammonia have been reinvestigated using ab initio quantum mechanical charge field (QMCF) molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The average coordination number of the first solvation consists of 2 ammonia and 4 waters. The mean residence time is less than 2 ps confirming the rapid mobility of ligands. The distance evolution data shows the frequent of ligand exchanges. The second solvation shell shows a more labile structure. The NBO analysis of the first shell structure emphasizes that interaction of K(I)-H2O is stronger than K(I)-H-3. The Wiberg bond confirms a weak electrostatic of ion-ligand interaction.

AB Based on the density functional theory and nonequilibrium Green's function method, we investigate the electronic structures and thermal spin transport properties of Christmas-tree silicene nanoribbons (CSiNRs). The results show that CSiNRs have ferromagnetic ground state with high Curie temperature far above the room temperature. Obvious spin Seebeck effect with spin-up and spin-down currents flowing in opposite directions by a temperature gradient can be observed in these systems. Furthermore, a thermal colossal magnetoresistance up to 10(9)% can be realized by tuning the external magnetic field. The results show that CSiNRs hold great potential in designing spin caloritronic devices. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Surface tension anomalies were observed in room temperature ionic liquid (RTIL)-acetone solutions. The RTILs are 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazorium iodide with [C(n)mim][I] in a [C(n)mim][I]-x mol% acetone. The maximum value of the surface tension appeared at 40 mol% acetone, although density decreased monotonically with an increase in acetone concentration. A small alkyl chain length effect of the C(n)mim(+) cations was observed in the surface tension. By the Gibbs adsorption isotherm, it was found that I - anion-mediated surface structure became dominant above 40 mol%. In the different [C(n)mim][TFSI]-acetone mixtures, normal decay of the surface tension was observed on the acetone concentration scale, where TFSI - is bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide.

AB Objective: Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning, intersex and asexual (LGBTQIA) individuals have unique sexual and reproductive health needs; however, facilitators and barriers to optimal care are largely understudied. The objective of this study was to synthesize findings from a systematic review of the literature regarding the provision of quality family planning services to LGBTQIA clients to inform clinical and research strategies.
   Study design: Sixteen electronic bibliographic databases (e.g., PubMed, PSYCinfo) were searched to identify articles published from January 1985 to April 2016 relevant to the analytic framework.
   Results: The search parameters identified 7193 abstracts; 19 descriptive studies met inclusion criteria. No studies assessed the impact of an intervention serving LGBTQIA clients on client experience, behavior or health outcomes. Two included studies focused on the perspectives of health care providers towards LGBTQIA clients. Of the 17 studies that documented client perspectives, 12 elucidated factors facilitating a client's ability to enter into care, and 13 examined client experience during care. Facilitators to care included access to a welcoming environment, clinicians knowledgeable about LGBTQIA needs and medical confidentiality.
   Conclusions: This systematic review found a paucity of evidence on provision of quality family planning services to LGBTQIA clients. However, multiple contextual facilitators and barriers to family planning service provision were identified. Further research is needed to assess interventions designed to assist LGBTQIA clients in clinical settings, and to gain a better understanding of effective education for providers, needs of specific subgroups (e.g., asexual individuals) and the role of the client's partner during receipt of care.

AB Pre-eclampsia (PE) is a human pregnancy syndrome with abnormal activation of the innate immune response. The study evaluated the involvement of molecular structures called damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), such as hyaluronan (HA) and heat shock proteins (Hsp) on NLRP1 and NLRP3 inflammasomes activation in peripheral blood monocytes. Twenty pre-eclamptic women, 20 normotensive pregnant women (NT) and 20 non-pregnant women (NP) were studied. Enzyme immunoassay was employed for the determination of HA, Hsp70 and High mobility group Box 1 (HMGB1) in plasma, as well as for the detection of Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), IL-18 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) in the supernatant of monocytes cultured with or without HA and Hsp70. The inflammasomes induction was evaluated by the quantification of mRNA for NLRP1, NLRP3, caspase-1, IL-1 beta, IL-18, HMGB1 and TNF-alpha by qPCR in monocyte culture. The results showed significantly higher plasma levels of HA, Hsp70 and HMGB1 in pre-eclamptic women than in NT and NP women. Monocytes from women with PE showed endogenous activation of NLRP1 and NLRP3 inflammasomes, and expressed high amounts of IL-1 beta, IL-18, HMGB1 and TNF-alpha. The stimulation of monocytes with HA increased the gene expression of NLRP1, NLRP3, caspase-1, TNF-alpha, HMGB1 and IL-18 and the production of IL-1 beta in preeclamptic women. Monocytes cultured with Hsp70 produced elevated levels of IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha through a mechanism independent of inflammasomes activation. These results suggest the participation of these DAMPs in the systemic inflammatory response that is characteristic of PE.

AB Introduction: beta Klotho (beta KL) is known to act as co-receptor for fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4) which is the main cognate receptor for fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19). Dysregulation of this FGF19/FGFR4/beta KL signaling axis has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several cancers. However, its role in the pathogenesis of thyroid cancer has not been determined.
   Materials and methods: The aim of this study was to assess FGF19, FGFR4 and beta KL concentrations in a group of 36 patients with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), 11 patients with follicular thyroid cancer (FTC), 9 patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) and a group of 19 subjects with multinodular nontoxic goiter (MNG). The control group consisted of 20 healthy volunteers. Serum FGF19, FGFR4 and beta KL concentrations were measured using specific ELISA methods.
   Results: Significantly lower concentrations of beta KL and higher concentrations of FGF19 were found in patients with PTC, FTC and ATC as compared with MNG group and controls. An elevation of FGFR4 serum concentration was observed in all thyroid cancer groups in comparison to MNG group and controls; however, in FTC group it was statistically insignificant. A positive correlation was found between beta KL and FGFR4 concentrations in PTC patients. The levels of beta KL, FGF19 and FGFR4 did not differ significantly between MNG group and healthy controls.
   Conclusions: Our results indicate that a disrupted FGF19/FGFR4/beta KL signaling pathway may play a role in the development of thyroid cancers. However, further studies are needed to elucidate the molecular mechanism of the neoplastic transition of thyroid epithelial cells.

AB Macrophages are key participants in melanoma growth and survival. In general, macrophages can be classified as M1 or M2 activation phenotypes. Increasing evidence demonstrates that melanoma exosomes also facilitate tumor survival and metastasis. However, the role of melanoma exosomes in directly influencing macrophage function is poorly understood. Herein, we investigated the hypothesis that natural melanoma exosomes might directly influence macrophage polarization. To explore this hypothesis, ELISA, RT-qPCR, and macrophage functional studies were performed in vitro using an established source of melanoma exosomes (B16-F10). ELISA results for melanoma exosome induction of common M1 and M2 cytokines in RAW 264.7 macrophages, revealed that melanoma exosomes do not polarize macrophages exclusively in the M1 or M2 direction. Melanoma exosomes induced the M1 and M2 representative cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-10 respectively. Further assessment, using an RT-qPCR array with RAW 264.7 and primary macrophages, confirmed and extended the ELISA findings. Upregulation of markers common to both M1 and M2 polarization phenotypes included CCL22, IL-12B, IL-1 beta, IL-6, i-NOS, and TNF-alpha. The M2 cytokine TGF-beta was upregulated in primary but not RAW 264.7 macrophages. Pro tumor functions have been attributed to each of these markers. Macrophage functional assays demonstrated a trend toward increased i-NOS (M1) to arginase (M2) activity. Collectively, the results provide the first evidence that melanoma exosomes can induce a mixed M1 and M2 pro-tumor macrophage activation phenotype.

AB The present research investigated the efficiency of an integrated system for the treatment of wastewaters generated at a rural property located in the city of Vera Cruz do Sul, southern Brazil. The integrated system was composed of an anaerobic unit (UASB/AB), 4 subsurface constructed wetlands (SSFCWs), and two photoreactors (UV-254 nm). The evaluation of the performance was based on the reduction of the load parameters and mainly on the detoxification of the wastewaters. The ecotoxicological analysis included short-term assays with the microcrustacean Daphnia magna whereas the cytogenetic potential of the wastewaters was assessed by using the Allium cepa test system. On the one hand, the raw wastewaters presented a strong pollution potential due to high COD, BOD5, TKN, N-NH3 and total P values. On the other hand, the effluents treated by the integrated system showed high reductions of the abovementioned parameters and fully attend the Brazilian and International legal requirements. Furthermore, the treated wastewaters presented a complete absence of the acute ecotoxicity (100%) as well as significant reductions of the cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, and mutagenicity when compared to the raw wastewaters. Therefore, the investigated system can be considered an interesting low-cost sanitation alternative, especially for wastewaters produced in rural areas, where decentralized systems are more suitable. Besides, the results obtained in the present work demonstrate the importance of including toxicity analysis in the monitoring of waters and wastewaters in order to obtain a broader evaluation concerning the efficiency of different treatment systems.

AB Less seasonal temperature variation in humid tropical and subtropical climate makes unique wastewater and removal performance of constructed wetlands (CWs) in South China. Nine single-stage CWs consisting of surface flow (SF), horizontal subsurface flow (HF) and vertical flow (VF) units vegetated with Canna indica or Thalia dealbata, as well as unvegetated filters were operated over 33 months (September 2013 to May 2016) to assess their removal capacity for domestic sewage and to evaluate the key influencing factors (i.e. vegetation, flow type, and temperature) in South China. The evaluation of the results indicated that these systems had great removal capacity of nutrient and organic matter. The average influent concentration of TN, NH4-N, TP and COD was 29.3, 23.3, 2.6 and 142.1 mg L-1, respectively. Removed load of TP, NH4-N, and COD were higher in VF CWs. Removed load of TN was higher in HF CWs. Influent loads positively influenced the removed loads of pollutants. Flow type had the greatest impact on removed load, followed by the temperature, and vegetation had minimal impact. VF (unvegetated) - HF (vegetated) could be the model of purification of domestic sewage by CWs in South China.

AB Constructed wetland treatment systems (CWTSs) could provide a passive, low-energy strategy for mitigating risks associated with oil sands process-affected waters (OSPWs). Due to the large volumes (over 975 million m(3)), heterogeneous composition, and acute and chronic toxicity of OSPW, passive and efficient treatment to decrease risks to biota will be necessary once operators obtain regulatory permission to discharge into aquatic receiving systems. The research objective was to design, assemble, and measure performance of a pilot-scale hybrid CWTS for treatment of OSPW. Constituents of concern (COCs) identified in OSPW included NAs, oil and grease, As, B, Cu, Pb, and Zn. Oxidizing conditions (net sediment redox > -50 mV) were promoted to allow aerobic degradation of organic constituents, and co-precipitation of arsenic with iron oxyhydroxides. Treatment of Cu, Pb, and Zn was targeted through precipitation with sulfides in reducing "micro-environments" in wetland sediments. Solar photocatalytic reactors (hybrid components) were used to remove recalcitrant organics. Performance was assessed using rates and extents of removal of COCs and changes in toxicity as indicated by Ceriodaphnia dubia. Mean total naphthenic acid fraction compound concentrations decreased from approximately 43 mg/L in untreated OSPW to 10 mg/L following a 16-d retention time in the hybrid CWTS. Mean As and Zn concentrations decreased from 0.026 mg/L and 0.129 mg/L in untreated OSPW to 0.011-0.014 mg/L and 0.052-0.062 mg/L in wetland outflows, respectively. Cu and Pb mass decreased by 13-26% in the CWTS; however, evaporative concentration masked removal (in terms of total metal concentrations). Toxicity (in terms of C. dubia survival and reproduction) of OSPW was eliminated following treatment. Results demonstrate that hybrid CWTSs can effectively degrade NAs and alleviate toxicity associated with metals and organics in OSPW.

AB Saltmarshes can be created to compensate for lost habitat by a process known as managed realignment (MR), where sea defences are deliberately breached to flood low-lying agricultural land. However, the vegetation that develops on MR sites is not equivalent to natural habitat. In natural sites, surface topography and creek networks are drivers of vegetation diversity, but their development on restored sites has not been well studied. We investigate the topographic characteristics of 19 MR areas, and compare these to nearby natural saltmarshes (representing desired conditions) and to coastal agricultural landscapes (representing conditions prior to MR). From high-resolution LiDAR data, we extracted values of elevation, six measures of surface topography (although two were later excluded due to collinearity), and three measures of creek density. MR and natural marshes differed significantly in all surface topographic indices, with MR sites having lower rugosity and more concave features, with greater potential for water accumulation. MR sites also had significantly lower creek density. MRs and coastal agricultural landscapes were more similar, differing in only one topographic measure. Importantly, there was no relationship between age since restoration and any of the topographic variables, indicating that restored sites are not on a trajectory to become topographically similar to natural marshes. MR schemes need to consider actively constructing topographic heterogeneity; better mirroring natural sites in this way is likely to benefit the development of saltmarsh vegetation, and will also have implications for a range of ecosystem functions.

TI Effect of submerged plant species on CH4 flux and methanogenic community

AB Annual monitoring of CH4 and associated microorganisms from four submerged plant species (Potamogeton crispus, Ceratophyllum demersum, Myriophyllum spicatum and Hydrilla verticillata) was conducted in a full-scale constructed wetland (CW). Plant species had a significant impact on CH4 emissions. The highest CH4 flux (5.7 mgm(-2) h(-1)) came from P. crispus, and the lowest flux (1.6 mgm(-2) h(-1)) was from M. spicatum. The dissolved oxygen (DO) and nitrogen of the rhizosphere was significantly affected by plant species, which were the most important factors affecting CH4 flux and methanogenic communities. Changes of DO level caused by plant species were more significant than temperature changes. Real-time quantitative PCR (q-PCR) analysis showed that the number of methanogens and methanotrophs varied with plant species and seasons, whereas the total number of eubacteria was less affected (p > 0.05). The variation of TN and NO2-N caused by plant species resulted in the differentiation of methanogen populations. Each plant species was characterized by a specific group of methanogens. Illumina sequencing showed that the dominant methanogenic populations from P. crispus and C. demersum were hydrogenotrophic archaea of the Methanoregula, while those from M. spicatum and H. verticillata were hydrogenotrophic archaea of the Methanobacterium. Both plant species and seasons affected the percentage of acetoclastic archaea of the Methanosarcina and Methanosaeta. This study indicates that the submerged plant species are important parameters in the production of CH4 emissions in CWs. The proper arrangement of submerged plant species in CWs is vital to maximize the environmental benefit.

AB The lignin (L) precipitated from black liquor was mixed with eggshell (ES) and followed by carbonization to prepare a hybrid porous adsorbent. The performance of removing of trace sulphur dioxide (SO2) from the air at room temperature was investigated. The optimization and statistical work was conducted by using the central composite design (CCD) together with the response surface methodology (RSM). Among the investigated operational parameters, the effect of carbonization temperature was found to be the most significant to the performance of SO2 removal by the prepared hybrid adsorbent. With an increase of carbonization temperature, the specific surface area increased appreciably reaching 130 m(2). g(-1) at 800 degrees C (L-ES-50-800-50). XRD analysis indicates the crystallite phase transition from calcite (CaCO3) to limestone (CaO) with an increase of carbonization temperature. The FT-IR study indicates the disappearance of out-plane vibration peaks of C-O from CaCO3 and gradual appearance of peaks from Ca-O of limestone on the surface of prepared hybrid material as an increase of carbonization temperature. The increased specific surface area and amount of limestone in the prepared hybrid adsorbent are found to contribute to the increased SO2 removal by the prepared hybrid adsorbent. The final optimal preparation condition was determined using RSM by setting maximum SO2 removal performance as optimization goal. The optimal preparation conditions achieved were: 50%= L/(L+ ES), carbonized at 800 degrees C for the duration of 50 min. The prepared hybrid adsorbent at the optimal preparation condition showed excellent SO2 removal performances in both wet and dry conditions.

AB Objective: Obesity has increased dramatically in the United States in recent decades. Our objective was to explore associations of contraceptive choices of US women, aged 20-44 years, with body mass index (BMI) and relevant covariates.
   Study design: Data are based on interviews with a national sample of 11,300 women in the 2011-2015 National Survey of Family Growth. We analyzed women ages 20-44 at risk of unintended pregnancy. The primary dependent variable was BMI category. Covariates analyzed included age, parity, race/ethnicity, marital status, self-reported health and education. Data were analyzed via cross-tabulation and logistic regression. We determined unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios for three categories of contraceptive method: female sterilization, intrauterine device (IUD) and hormonal contraception.
   Results: Obese women have higher odds of female sterilization (BMI 30.0-34.9 kg/m(2) : adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.45-2.66; BMI 35.0 kg/m(2) and higher: aOR=1.56, 95% CI 1.13-2.14) compared to women with normal BMI. Odds of IUD use are significantly higher among women with BMI >35 kg/m(2) (aOR=1.64, 95% CI 1.20-2.25). Odds of hormonal contraceptive use are correspondingly reduced (aOR=0.78, 95% CI 0.62-0.98) for women in the highest BMI category.
   Conclusions: Contraceptive use varies by BMI category even after adjusting for usual correlates of use. Differences in contraceptive use by BMI category have implications for contraceptive counseling and provision.
   Implications: Findings that obese women are more likely to rely on female sterilization raise questions about how weight concerns and obesity affect contraceptive decision making. Future research could explore associations between obesity and contraceptive use in adolescent women. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Objective: To investigate whether demographic, socioeconomic, and reproductive health characteristics affect long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) use differently by race-ethnicity. Results may inform the dialogue on racial pressure and bias in LARC promotion.
   Study design: Data derived from the 2011-2013 and 2013-2015 National Surveys of Family Growth (NSFG). Our study sample included 9321 women aged 15-44. Logistic regression analyses predicted current LARC use (yes vs. no). We tested interaction terms between race-ethnicity (non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic) and covariates (for example, education, parity, poverty level) to explore whether their effects on LARC use vary by race-ethnicity.
   Results: In the race-interactions model, data did not show that low income and education predict LARC use more strongly among Black and Hispanic women than among White women. There was just one statistically significant race-interaction: experience of unintended pregnancy (p=.014). Among Whites and Hispanics, women who reported ever experiencing an unintended pregnancy had a higher predicted probability of LARC use than those who did not. On the other hand, among Black women, the experience of unintended pregnancy was not associated with a higher predicted probability of LARC use.
   Conclusions: With the exception of the experience of unintended pregnancy, findings from this large, nationally representative sample of women suggest similar patterns in LARC use by race-ethnicity. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: Access to a full range of contraceptive methods, including long-acting reversible contraception (LARC), is central to providing quality family planning services. We describe health center-related factors associated with LARC availability, including staff training in LARC insertion/removal and approaches to offering LARC, whether onsite or through referral.
   Study Design: We analyzed nationally representative survey data collected during 2013-2014 from administrators of publicly funded U.S. health centers that offered family planning. The response rate was 49.3% (n=1615). In addition to descriptive statistics, we used multivariable logistic regression to identify health center characteristics associated with offering both IUDs and implants onsite.
   Results: Two-thirds (64%) of health centers had staff trained in all three LARC types (hormonal IUD, copper IUD, implant); 21% had no staff trained in any of those contraceptive methods. Half of health centers (52%) offered IUDs (any type) and implants onsite. After onsite provision, informal referral arrangements were the most common way LARC methods were offered. In adjusted analyses, Planned Parenthood (AOR=9.49) and hospital-based (AOR=2.35) health centers had increased odds of offering IUDs (any type) and implants onsite, compared to Health Departments, as did Title X-funded (AOR=1.55) compared to non-Title X-funded health centers and centers serving a larger volume of family planning clients. Centers serving mostly rural areas compared to those serving urbans areas had lower odds (AOR 0.60) of offering IUD (any type) and implants.
   Conclusions: Variation in LARC access remains among publicly funded health centers. In particular, Health Departments and rural health centers have relatively low LARC provision. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Exposure to routine availability of immediate postpartum LARC: effect on
   attitudes and practices of labor and delivery and postpartum nurses
SO CONTRACEPTION

ID VISIT; CONTRACEPTION; WOMEN
AB Objectives: Nurses play an integral role in intrapartum and postpartum patient education. This exploratory study aims to assess the attitudes, knowledge, and practices of labor and delivery and postpartum nurses regarding contraception and evaluate for changes in these measures 1 year after an institutional initiative allowing routine availability of immediate postpartum long-acting reversible contraception (LARC).
   Study design: In 2014, Montefiore Medical Center began to routinely offer comprehensive immediate postpartum contraception. The initiative included education and feedback sessions for labor and delivery and postpartum nurses on contraception, including immediate postpartum initiation of LARC. Nurses completed anonymous surveys at the beginning of the initiative (n=59) and at 1 year (n=56). We compared baseline and 1 year survey results of contraceptive knowledge, attitudes and practices using chi(2) test, Fisher's Exact Test, or t test as appropriate.
   Results: Nurses who stated they counseled patients on contraception "always" or "most of the time" increased from 27/59 (46%) to 40/56 (71%) (p=.005). The number of nurses who would recommend the intrauterine device and implant for postpartum contraception increased from 1/59 (2%) to 18/56 (32%) (p<.0001). Attitudes towards injectable contraception and breastfeeding remained negative; 27/59 nurses (46%) at baseline and 34/56 (61%) at 1 year agreed with the statement "DMPA [depot medroxyprogesterone acetate] has a negative effect on breastfeeding."
   Conclusions: Experience working in a location with routine access to immediate postpartum contraception is associated with increased awareness among nurses of postpartum contraceptive options, especially LARC, and increased contraceptive counseling. Concerns about the impact of hormonal contraception on breastfeeding, specifically DMPA, are persistent and prevalent. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: We sought to identify factors associated with nonadherence to instructions for using a novel contraceptive providing 1 year of protection.
   Study design: Data from a multicountry Phase 3 trial of the Nestorone (R) (segesterone acetate)/ethinyl estradiol (NES/EE) contraceptive vaginal ring (CVR) were analyzed. Participants were instructed to use the CVR over 13 cycles and follow a 21/7 regimen. Their reports of CVR removals >2 h outside scheduled removal periods served as a proxy for nonadherence. We used multivariate logistic regression to determine factors associated with such use.
   Results: Of 905 participants, 120 (13%) reported CVR removals >2 h. Removals for washing [odds ratio (OR) 3.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.50-6.27] or sexual intercourse (OR 3.19, 95% CI 2.03-4.99), and finding CVR insertion difficult (OR 2.80, 95% CI 1.36-5.80) were factors associated with removals >2 h. Lower educational attainment also predicted ring removal >2 h (OR 3.23, 95% CI 1.55-6.75). Women residing in Europe or Australia were less likely to remove the ring for >2 h compared with women in the United States (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.24-0.83 and OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.02-0.98, respectively). Participants who reported removals >2 h were more likely to discontinue CVR use (OR 1.93, 95% CI 1.24-2.95), report dissatisfaction (OR 2.20, 95% CI 1.32-3.69) and become pregnant during the study (OR 4.07, 95% CI 1.58-10.50).
   Conclusions: Removing the CVR for washing and removing it before intercourse are factors associated with nonadherence to ring use. These are important topics for counseling women who are considering or using vaginal rings, including the NES/EE CVR. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Background: As part of a program to develop a novel estradiol-releasing contraceptive vaginal ring (CVR), we evaluated the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of CVRs releasing segesterone acetate (Nestorone (R) (NES)) combined with one of three different estradiol (E-2) doses.
   Study design: A prospective, double-blind, randomized, multi-centered study to evaluate a 90-day CVR releasing NES [200 mcg/day] plus E-2, either 10 mcg/day, 20 mcg/day, or 40 mcg/day in healthy reproductive-age women with regular cycles. Participants provided blood samples twice weekly for NES and E-2 levels during the first 60 days (ring 1) and the last 30 days (ring 2) of use. A subset underwent formal PK assessments at ring initiation, ring exchange (limited PK), and study completion.
   Results: The main study enrolled 197 women; 22 participated in the PK substudy. Baseline characteristics between the main and PK participants were comparable, with an average BMI of 25.8 kg/m(2) (SD 4.3). In the PK substudy, all three rings showed similar NES PK: mean area under the curve (AUC((0-72)) ) 34,181 pg*day/mL; concentration maximum (C-max) 918 pg/mL; time to maximum concentration (T-max) 3.5 h. For E-2, the C-max occurred at 2 h, and was significantly higher with the 20 mcg/day ring (mean 390 pg/mL); 10 mcg/day, 189 pg/mL, p=.003; 40 mcg/day, 189 pg/mL, p<.001), and declined rapidly tc <= 50 pg/mL for all doses by 24 h. For all subjects, the median E-2 levels remained under 35 pg/mL during treatment.
   Conclusion: PK parameters of NES were not affected when paired with different doses of E-2, but E-2 levels from all three doses were lower than anticipated and no dose response was observed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: The objectives were to compare the long-term outcomes, including hysterectomy, chronic pelvic pain (CPP) and abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB), in women post hysteroscopic sterilization (HS) and laparoscopic tubal ligation (TL) in the Medicaid population.
   Study design: This was a retrospective observational cohort analysis using data from the US Medicaid Analytic Extracts Encounters database. Women aged 18 to 49 years with at least one claim for HS (n=3929) or TL (n= 10,875) between July 1, 2009, through December 31, 2010, were included. Main outcome measures were hysterectomy, CPP or AUB in the 24 months poststerilization. Propensity score matching was used to control for patient demographics and baseline characteristics. Logistic regression analysis investigated the variables associated with a 24-month rate of each outcome in the HS versus laparoscopic TL cohorts.
   Results: Postmatching analyses were performed at 6, 12 and 24 months post index procedure. At 24 months, hysterectomy was more common in the laparoscopic TL than the HS group (3.5% vs. 2.1%; p=.0023), as was diagnosis of CPP (26.8% vs. 23.5%; p=.0050). No significant differences in AUB diagnoses were observed. Logistic regression identified HS as being associated with lower risk of hysterectomy (odds ratio [OR] 0.77 [95% confidence interval {CI} 0.60-0.97]; p=.0274) and lower risk of CPP diagnosis (OR 0.91 [95% CI 0.83-0.99]; p= .0336) at 24 months poststerilization.
   Conclusion: In Medicaid patients, HS is associated with a significantly lower risk of hysterectomy or CPP diagnosis 24 months poststerilization versus laparoscopic TL. Incidence of AUB poststerilization is not significantly different. While some differences in outcomes were statistically significant, the effect sizes were small, and the conclusion is one of equivalence and not clinical superiority. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

   motherhood; Adolescent pregnancy
ID SUBSEQUENT PREGNANCY; ADOLESCENT; PROGRAM; CARE
AB Objectives: Postpartum contraception plays a significant role in reducing subsequent pregnancy. However, young mothers in Ottawa, the capital of Canada, face various barriers when trying to access contraception after delivery. Through this project, we aimed to explore these barriers and understand the decision-making processes of young mothers surrounding postpartum contraception.
   Study design: We conducted 10 semistructured in-depth interviews with young mothers living in Ottawa who had experienced a subsequent pregnancy within 24 months of their first childbirth. In addition, we interviewed 10 key informants who work with teenage mothers. We audio-recorded and transcribed all interviews and analyzed them using inductive and deductive techniques. We used ATLAS.ti software to manage our data.
   Results: Both young mothers and key informants report that teen mothers in Ottawa often do not use postpartum contraception or inconsistently use their chosen contraceptive method. Many factors, including cost, personal beliefs, personal priorities and knowledge, influence young mothers' decision making surrounding contraception.
   Conclusions: Our study suggests that when young mothers do not use postpartum contraception, the reasons are complex; for some, this is a choice, and for others, this is the result of systems-level, service delivery and information barriers. Supporting policies to ensure that a full range of contraceptive methods are available and affordable and developing educational programs in Ottawa that are sex-positive and nonjudgmental appear warranted.

ID MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES; SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA; INTERVENTIONS
AB Objectives: This paper presents the impact of key components of the Senegal Urban Reproductive Health Initiative, including radio, television, community-based activities, Muslim religious-leader engagement and service quality improvement on modern contraceptive use by all women and the sub-sample of poor women.
   Study design: This study uses baseline (2011) and endline (2015) longitudinal data from a representative sample of urban women first surveyed in 2011 to examine the impact of the Initiative's demand- and supply-side activities on modern contraceptive use.
   Results: By endline, there was increased exposure to radio and television programming, religious leaders speaking favorably about contraception, and community-based initiatives. In the same period, modern contraceptive use increased from 16.9% to 22.1% with a slightly larger increase among the poor (16.6% to 24.1%). Multivariate analyses demonstrate that women exposed to community-based activities were more likely to use modern contraception by endline (marginal effect (ME): 5.12; 95% confidence interval (Cl): 2.50-7.74) than those not exposed. Further, women living within 1 km of a facility with family planning guidelines were more likely to use (ME: 3.54; 95% CI: 1.88-5.20) than women without a nearby facility with guidelines. Among poor women, community-based activities, radio exposure (ME: 4.21; 95% CI: 0.49-7.93), and living close to program facilities (ME: 4.32; 95% CI: 0.04-8.59) impacted use.
   Conclusions: Community-based activities are important for reaching urban women, including poor women, to achieve increased contraceptive use. Radio programming is also an important tool for increasing demand, particularly among poor women. Impacts of other program activities on contraceptive use were modest. Implications: This study demonstrates that community-based activities led to increased modern contraceptive use among all women and poor women in urban Senegal. These findings can inform future programs in urban Senegal and elsewhere in francophone Africa. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Objectives: The objective of this study was to determine the cost of unintended pregnancy (UP) in Sweden and savings generated by a switch of 5% of women from short-acting reversible contraception (SARC) and other methods to long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs).
   Study design: We constructed an economic model to estimate the number and costs of UPs and contraceptive use over a 1-year period. The population consisted of all women aged 15-44 years requiring reversible contraception and at risk of UP. UPs could result in birth, spontaneous abortion, induced abortion, and ectopic pregnancy. The model included costs incurred by the healthcare payer or out-of-pocket expenses by women, and indirect costs, i.e., foregone wages from time away from work.
   Results: We estimated 73,989 unintended pregnancies yearly, amounting to costs of almost (sic)158 million. A 5% switch from non-LARCs to LARCs would generate more than 3500 fewer UPs yearly with savings of nearly (sic)7.7 million. The majority of these savings would arise from reduced costs for UPs.
   Conclusions: UPs are costly for society and women. A small change in the proportion of women using the most effective methods generates substantial cost savings due to fewer UPs and thus fewer abortions. A switch in 5% of women using non-LARCs could prevent more than 3500 UPs yearly, generating savings of more than SEK 70 million ((sic)7.7 million) or of 2.4% of costs for UPs. (C) 2018 The Author(s).

AB Objective: To compare estimated versus measured blood loss at the time of dilation and evacuation (D&E).
   Study design: We measured blood loss for all D&E procedures between 16 and 24 weeks at one abortion clinic over 9 months. We weighed all blood-containing items and measured blood captured in the D&E tray. Providers recorded estimated blood loss before weighing or measuring blood. We compared median measured blood loss (MBL) and estimated blood loss (EBL) for each gestational week.
   Results: We measured blood loss in 371 of the 534 D&Es in the study period; we excluded 163 procedures because of failure to measure blood loss or contamination with amniotic fluid. Included and excluded procedures had similar median EBL5. Median EBL differed significantly from MBL for each week gestation from 16 to 24 weeks (p <=.001 for all comparisons); MBL was approximately twice as high as EBL for each gestational week. EBL and MBL increased with increasing gestation, as did the difference between EBL and MBL.
   Conclusion: Providers consistently and significantly underestimate blood loss at the time of D81. D&E providers may want to consider using a new heuristic for estimating blood loss. Implications: Providers significantly underestimate blood loss at the time of D&E. Future research should confirm these findings (particularly at 22-24 weeks gestation), evaluate the efficacy of interventions to improve estimations of blood loss, and determine best practices for decreasing blood loss.

AB Molybdenum disulfide is a promising catalyst to replace the expensive platinum as an electrocatalyst but needs to be modified to present excellent electrocatalytic properties. Herein, we successfully modify molybdenum disulfide in methanol solvent for hydrogen evolution reaction by using a simple hydrothermal method. Overpotential reduced to -0.6 V from -1.5 V, and energy band gap decreased from 1.73 eV to 1.58 eV after the modification. The modified molybdenum disulfide also demonstrated lower resistance (42 Omega) at high frequency (1000 kHz) compared with that (240 Omega) of the precursor, showing that conductivity of the modified molybdenum disulfide has improved.

AB Carboxyl-terminated butadiene-co-acrylonitrile (CTBN) was used as the toughener to improve the mechanical performance and fracture toughness of diglycidyl ether of bisphenol F (DGEBF) by prereacted approach. The results show that the chemical bonding interface was formed between DGEBF and CTBN particles in the prepolymerization reaction process, which remarkably enhances the fracture toughness of the composites. Based on the qualitative and quantitative analyses, it shows the main toughening mechanisms are the plastic shear banding effect resulted from the plastic deformation of the EP matrix and the plastic void expansion because of the debonding of CTBN particles from the EP matrix.

AB A new method for finding the minimum free energy pathway (MFEP) of ions and small molecule transportation through a protein based on the three-dimensional reference interaction site model (3D-RISM) theory combined with the string method has been proposed. The 3D-RISM theory produces the distribution function, or the potential of mean force (PMF), for transporting substances around the given protein structures. By applying the string method to the PMF surface, one can readily determine the MFEP on the PMF surface. The method has been applied to consider the Na+ conduction pathway of channelrhodopsin as an example. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Co-sensitization technique has been appraised for attaining enhanced performance in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). DSSCs are fabricated with a heteroleptic Ru(II) sensitizer (RDAB1) containing 4,4'-dia mino-2,2'-bipyridine (dabpy) ligand, co-sensitized with electron donor-acceptor type coumarin containing thiophene (CT) and indole (CI) moieties. The individual overall power conversion efficiency of the sensitizer is 5.44%. Enhanced power conversion efficiencies of 6.34% and 7.09% were observed when RDAB1 was co-sensitized with Coumarin containing CI and CT respectively. The enhanced PCE can be attributed to the presence of co-sensitizers which effectively overcome the light absorption by I-/I-3(-), dye aggregation and charge recombination. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB OH-initiated atmospheric oxidation mechanism of 1-chloronaphthalene (1-CN) was investigated using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The oxidation is predicted to be initiated by OH addition to the a-positions, and the additions to C4 and C5 are more favorable. 1-CN-OH adducts tend to react with ambient O-2 to produce peroxy intermediates, followed by intramolecular H-shifts producing C10H7OCl and diketone or unimolecular ring closure forming methyl glyoxal and Cl-substituted phthalaldialde-hyde. Despite that the rate constants are influenced by the tunneling factors, intramolecular H-shift reactions are suggested to be more favorable. The OH-determined lifetime of 1-CN is 0.62 days.

AB Silica and alumina coated rutile TiO2 samples with various surface morphologies were fabricated using four different pre-dispersants. Using sodium silicate nonahydrate (SSNH) as pre-dispersant, the received sample displayed the best acidic stability. The addition of SSNH could induce layer-by-layer growth of hydrous silica via enhancing the dispersion of hydrous silica nucleus and accelerating the dehydration condensation rate of silica film. Alumina coated rutile TiO2 sample obtained by polyethyleneglycol 1000 (PEG) presented the highest dispersion stability. The existence of PEG can induce the formation of fibrous hydrous alumina film, which would increase the steric hindrance and the promotion of dispersion stability. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Present paper reports theoretical investigation of less explored nitrides of Iridium and Osmium using semi-empirical model with charge transfer effect (CTE). This work indicates the presence of structural phase transition in these nitrides from zinc-blend (B3) to rock-salt (B1) structure on application of pressure on them. Transitions occurred at 71 GPa and 86 GPa, with sudden drops in volume of 9.54% and 8.35% in IrN and OsN. The effect of pressure on elastic properties for B3-IrN and B3-OsN is investigated for the first time. On the basis of mechanical properties, it is observed that both compounds are ductile in nature. The present study is extended to investigate transition metal alloy IrxOs1-xN via Vegard's law. To widen the applicability of our model and to explore this alloy we report structural, elastic, mechanical and thermophysical properties. The effect of pressure on Debye temperature with different concentration (x = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1) have also been analyzed. The results are in general in good agreement with available theoretical results. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We have considered a homogeneously oriented liquid crystal (HOLC) microvolume, confined between two infinitely long horizontal coaxial cylinders subjected to both a temperature gradient del T and a radially applied electric field E. We have investigated dynamic field pumping, i.e. studied the interactions between director, velocity, electric fields, as well as a radially applied temperature gradient, where the inner cylinder is kept at a lower temperature than the outer one. In order to elucidate the role of del T and E in producing hydrodynamic flow, we have carried out a numerical study of a system of hydrodynamic equations including director reorientation, fluid flow, and temperature redistribution across the HOLC cavity. Calculations show that, under the effect of the named perturbations and at high curvature of the inner cylinder, the HOLC microvolume settles down to a nonstandard pumping regime with maximum flow in the vicinity of the cooler inner cylinder.

ID 1ST PRINCIPLES
AB The structures and electronic properties of KTa1/2Nb1/2O3 under high pressures have been investigated using the first-principles calculations. Three candidates with B site cation ordered along the [1 0 0], [1 1 0] and [1 1 1] directions are found stable under different pressures by thermodynamics, mechanics and dynamics stability criteria. Further electronic analysis indicates that three structures are semiconductors with different band-gap characteristics. The peculiar chemical bonds of Nb-O and Ta-O are expected to be related to the different electronegativity of the corresponding cations. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Quantum chemical calculations were performed for beryllium homocatenated compounds [H-(Be)(n)-H]. Global minimum structures were found using machine searches (Coalescence Kick method) with density functional theory. Chemical bonding analysis was performed with the Adaptive Natural Density Partitioning method. It was found that H-(Be)(2)-H and H-(Be)(3)-H clusters are linear with classical twocenter two-electron bonds, while for n > 3, three-dimensional structures are more stable with multicenter bonding. Thus, at n = 4, multicenter bonding wins the tug-of-war vs. the classical bonding. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, we explored the spontaneous and controlled-diameter growth of carbon nanotubes. We evaluated the effects of catalyst density, reduction time, and a number of catalyst coating on the substrate (for multi-walled carbon nanotubes) on the diameter of single-walled carbon nanotubes and the number of layers in few-walled carbon nanotubes. Increasing the catalyst density and reduction time increased the diameters of the carbon nanotubes, with the average diameter increasing from 1.05 nm to 1.86 nm for single-walled carbon nanotubes. Finally, we succeeded in synthesizing a significant double-walled carbon nanotube population of 24%. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The effects of halogen substitution on microstructure, optical absorption, and phonon modes for perovskite CH3NH3PbX3(MAPbX(3), X = I/Br/Cl) films grown on FTO substrates have been investigated. The X-ray diffraction analysis exhibited good crystallization, and the strong diffraction peak assigned to (100)(c) for X = Br/Cl shifted toward a higher angle compared to (110)(t) of MAPbI(3). Band-gap tuning from 1.63 to 2.37 to 3.11 eV in the I-Br-Cl series can be found due to the halogen effects. These energy values closely match the positions of peak determined from photoluminescence experiments. The remarkable absorption dip and emission peak appear for the MAPbBr(3), suggesting higher crystallinity under the same preparation conditions. The wavenumbers of main IR-vibrations slightly decrease with ionic radius of the halogen increasing (in the order of Cl-Br-I), which related to the increasing polarizability. These results provide important progress towards the understanding of the halide role in the realization of high performance MAPbX(3)-based solar cells. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A novel iridium complex grafting hole-transporting triphenylamine (TPA) unit onto cyclometalated ligand, namely t-BuPyrPyTPA)(2)Ir(acac), was successfully synthesized and characterized. The photophysical, electrochemical and DFT/TD-DFT calculation, as well as electroluminescence properties of this iridium complex were fully investigated. Meanwhile, the PLEDs employing (t-BuPyrPyTPA)(2)Ir(acac) as dopant presented stable NIR emission peaked at 697 nm and a shoulder at 764 nm with a highest external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 0.56% at 4 wt% dopant concentration. These results demonstrate that expanding the conjugation length of the ligand is an effective way to achieve NIR emission. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Four stable configurations were found upon adsorption of the chloramphenicol on a period slab model of the vermiculite surface, using the PBE and C09-vdW functionals in a projector-augmented wave ( PAW) method approach. The adsorption is a strong chemisorption process, characterized by an adsorption energy of -106.5 kcal mol(-1) at the most stable configuration. Stability of configurations contributed mainly by Mg center dot center dot center dot O/Cl attractive electrostatic interactions and C/O-H center dot center dot center dot O hydrogen bonds. It is remarkable that the vermiculite is found to be a solid material with good potential to be used for adsorption and consequent removal of this type of antibiotic drugs. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Modern force fields are accurate enough to describe thermal effects in molecular crystals. Here, we have extended our earlier approach to discrete force fields for various temperatures to a force field with a continuous function. For the parametrisation of the force field, we used data mining on experimental structures with the temperature as an additional descriptor. The obtained force field can be used to minimise energy at a finite temperature and for molecular dynamics with zero-K potentials. The applicability of the method has been demonstrated for the prediction of crystal density, temperature density gradients and transition temperature. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The coupled complex quantum Hamilton-Jacobi equations for electronic nonadiabatic transitions are approximately solved by propagating individual quantum trajectories in real space. Equations of motion are derived through use of the derivative propagation method for the complex actions and their spatial derivatives for wave packets moving on each of the coupled electronic potential surfaces. These equations for two surfaces are converted into the moving frame with the same grid point velocities. Excellent wave functions can be obtained by making use of the superposition principle even when nodes develop in wave packet scattering. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Accurate determination of the bond dissociation energies (BDEs) of large alkanes is desirable but practically impossible due to the expensive cost of high-level ab initio methods. We developed a two-layer ONIOM-CCSD(T)/CBS method which treats the high layer with CCSD(T) method and the low layer with DFT method, respectively. The accuracy of this method was validated by comparing the calculated BDEs of n-hexane with that obtained at the CCSD(T)-F12b/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory. On this basis, the C-C BDEs of C-6-C-20 n-alkanes were calculated systematically using the ONIOM [CCSD(T)/CBS(D-T): M06-2x/6-311++G(d,p)] method, showing a good agreement with the data available in the literature.

AB Graphite-like carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanosheets have been facilely assembled via electrostatic interaction onto cotton fabrics for achieving multi-functionalities. The surface morphologies, chemical composition and optical features of the g-C3N4-coated fabrics were characterized. The treated cotton fabrics exhibited remarkable photocatalytic degradation activity and superior self-cleaning performance. A complete degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) and removal of stains were accomplished under simulated sunlight irradiation. More importantly, the modified fabrics can be reused in catalysis reactions with great durability. The practical treatment approach demonstrated from this work has great potential to be applied in textile industry for functional fabrics manufacture. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Multielectronic states quantum dynamics on a grid is described in a manner motivated by on the fly classical trajectory computations. Non stationary electronic states are prepared by a few cycle laser pulse. The nuclei respond and begin moving. We solve the time dependent Schrodinger equation for the electronic and nuclear dynamics for excitation from the ground electronic state. A satisfactory accuracy is possible using a localized description on a discrete grid. This enables computing on the fly for both the nuclear and electronic dynamics including non-adiabatic couplings. Attosecond dynamics in LiH is used as an example. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The limiting ionic molar conductivity (lambda(infinity)) of an electrolyte solution depends on the self-diffusion coefficient (D-s) of the pure solvent when the temperature (T) changes. To study the D-s-dependence of lambda(infinity), we proposed a new empirical relation lambda(infinity) proportional to (D-s/T)(t), with a parameter t. The relation is applied to the lambda(infinity) and D-s of alkali, tetra-alkyl ammonium, and halogen ions in water or methanol. All ions except for tetra-alkyl ammonium ions in water exhibit excellent linear relationships in their lambda(infinity) proportional to (D-s/T)(t) plots, with t in the range from 0.88 to 1.26. This is the first report showing an affirmative linear correlation between lambda(infinity) and D-s. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The thermite reaction at Al/CuO nano-interfaces is investigated with ab initio molecular dynamics calculations in canonical ensemble at 500 K, 800 K, 1200 K and 1500 K, respectively. The reaction process and reaction products are analyzed in terms of chemical bonds, average charge, time constants and total potential energy. The activity of the reactants enhances with increasing temperature, which induces a faster thermite reaction. The alloy reaction obviously expands outward at Cu-rich interface of Al/CuO system, and the reaction between Al and O atoms obviously expands outward at O-rich interface as temperature increases. Different reaction products are found at the outermost layer of different interfaces in the Al/CuO system. In generally, the average charge of the outer layer aluminum atoms (i.e., Al1, Al2, Al5 and Al6) increases with temperature. The potential energy of Al/CuO system decreases significantly, which indicates that drastic exothermic reaction occurs at the Al/CuO system. This research enhances fundamental understanding in temperature effect on the thermite reaction at atomic level, which can potentially open new possibilities for its industrial application.

AB We report a first-principles time dependent density functional theory study of the optical response modulations in bimetallic core-shell (Na@Al and Al@Na) and multi-shell (Al@Na@Al@Na and Na@Al@Na@Al: concentric shells of Al and Na alternate) nanorods. All of the core-shell and multi-shell configurations display highly enhanced absorption intensity with respect to the pure Al and Na nanorods, showing sensitivity to both composition and chemical ordering. Remarkably large spectral intensity enhancements were found in a couple of core-shell configurations, indicative that optical response averaging based on the individual components can not be considered as true as always in the case of bimetallic core-shell nanorods. We believe that our theoretical results would be useful in promising applications depending on Aluminum-based plasmonic materials such as solar cells and sensors. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Gas-phase N-14 and N-15 NMR studies of nitrogen and synthetic air pressurized up to 300 bar were performed. It was found that the magnetic shielding of an isolated N-2 molecule, sigma(0)(N) = -63.4(2) ppm, is in good agreement with the results of ab initio calculations. The binary N-2-O-2 interactions contribute to shielding an order of the magnitude larger than the N-2-N-2 pairs. For nitrogen the three body collisions become observable by NMR for pressure higher than 200 bar and the appropriate coefficient can be practically assigned to the interaction between one molecule of N-2 and a pair of O-2 molecules.

AB Surface molecularly imprinting polymer (SMIP) was utilized in the removal of a residual pesticide (carbaryl (CBL)) in water and simulated fruit juice. Being the crosslinking agent, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) was copolymerized with the monomer, methacrylic acid (MAA) and CBL as the template molecules on the surface of the silica gel particles to produce the SMIP adsorbents. The SMIP adsorbents showed good selectivity and good adsorption capacity for CBL in the competitive adsorptions with two structurally related carbamate pesticides. The effect of the pretreatment solvents on the adsorption capacity of the SMIP adsorbent was investigated with the results of the numerical simulations. The adsorption isotherms and the adsorption kinetics were well described by the Freundlich equilibrium model and the pseudo-second-order kinetic model, respectively. Scatchard plot analysis revealed that there were two classes of binding sites populated in the SMIP adsorbents. In addition, the good selective adsorption of CBL by the SMIP adsorbent in a simulated fruit juice containing vitamin C and fructose indicated the great potential of the SMIP adsorbents to remove residual pesticide in food industry and processing industry for agricultural products.

We experimentally measured thermodynamic forces and fluxes during ATP synthesis, and calculated the thermodynamic efficiency, eta and the rate of free energy dissipation, Phi. We show that the OX PHOS system is tuned such that the coupled nonequilibrium processes operate at optimal eta. This state does not coincide with the state of minimum Phi but is compatible with maximum Phi under the imposed constraints. Conditions that must hold for species concentration in order to satisfy the principle of optimal efficiency are derived analytically and a molecular explanation based on Nath's torsional mechanism of energy transduction and ATP synthesis is suggested. Differences of the proposed principle with Prigogine's principle are discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We present a theoretical investigation on the structural evolution and bonding properties of PtnC2-/0 (n = 1-7) clusters using density functional theoretical calculations. The results showed that both anionic and neutral PtnC2 (n = 1-7) clusters primarily adopt 2D planar chain-shaped or ring-based structures. The two C atoms directly interact with each other to form a CAC bond for n = 1-3, while the two C atoms are separated by the Pt atoms for n = 4-7, except for neutral Pt5C2. Pt4C2- anion and Pt4C2 neutral both show r plus p double delocalized bonding patterns. (C) 2018 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB We report the synthesis of nanosized (40-50 nm) CaCu3-xMnxTi4-xMnxO12 (x = 0, 0.5 and 1) quadruple perovskite (QP) semiconductor via a modified combustion method for use as Schottky barrier diode (SBD) at the Al/QP junction. The fabricated SBD is analysed on the basis of thermionic emission theory to observe its quality and some important diode parameters. For insight analysis of charge transport mechanism through metal-semiconductor junction, theory of space charge limited currents is applied and discussed in the light of parameters like carrier concentration, mobility-lifetime product and diffusion length. The Mn-doped exhibit better device performance compared to parent material. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, g-C3N4-Cu2O was successfully synthesized in the presence of PEG-400 surfactant via an acid treatment hydrothermal method and a high-temperature calcination method. The structures and properties of as-synthesized samples were characterized using a range of techniques, such as XPS, TEM, PL and BET. The g-C3N4-Cu2O heterojunction exhibits the enhanced photocatalytic performance and high stability. It is revealed that the addition of PEG can promote the heterojunction effect of g-C3N4-Cu2O, effectively improving the crystallinity and specific surface area of the photocatalyst, separation efficiency of photocarriers, and light absorption, thus enhancing the photocatalytic performance.

AB The efficient fast path optimization (FPO) method is proposed to optimize the reaction paths on energy surfaces by using chains of conformations. No artificial spring force is used in the FPO method to ensure the equal spacing of adjacent conformations. The FPO method is applied to optimize the reaction path on two model potential surfaces. The use of this method enabled the optimization of the reaction paths with a drastically reduced number of optimization cycles for both potentials. It was also successfully utilized to define the MEP of the isomerization of the glycine molecule in water by FPO method. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The linear and nonlinear properties of isomeric forms of pyridinium-N-phenoxide betaine dye were investigated in protic and aprotic solvents using atomistic simulations. We employed the sequential Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics (S-QM/MM) and the free energy gradient (FEG) methods to optimize the geometry of each isomer in chloroform, acetonitrile, methanol and water. The results show a complex dependence of the first hyperpolarizability with respect to the solvent nature and isomeric form, with a marked effect of conformational changes for para-betaine. Large contrasts of the first hyperpolarizability show a clear distinction between isomeric forms in solution that could be experimentally detected. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The D-2(+) molecular complex fundamental properties in a uniform and multi-hilled semiconductor quantum ribbon under orthogonal electric and magnetic fields are theoretically studied. The energy structure is calculated by using adiabatic approximation combined with diagonalization procedure. The D-2(+) energy structure is more strongly controlled by the geometrical structural hills than the Coulomb interaction. The formation of vibrational and rotational states is discussed. Aharanov-Bohm oscillation patterns linked to rotational states as well as the D-2(+) molecular complex stability are highly sensitive to the number of hills while electric field breaks the electron rotational symmetry and removes the energy degeneration between low-lying states.

AB Core-electron binding energies (CEBEs) computed within a Dself-consistent field approach require large basis sets to achieve convergence with respect to the basis set limit. It is shown that supplementing a basis set with basis functions from the corresponding basis set for the element with the next highest nuclear charge (Z + 1) provides basis sets that give CEBEs close to the basis set limit. This simple procedure provides relatively small basis sets that are well suited for calculations where the description of a core-ionised state is important, such as time-dependent density functional theory calculations of X-ray emission spectroscopy.

AB Background: The Angiopoietin/Tie (Tyrosine kinase with Ig and EGF homology domains) signaling axis has crucial influences on angiogenesis and the vasculature's reorganization. Moreover, angiopoietin-2. (Ang2) is discussed as a biomarker for diseases' severity and development. Previous studies reported increased Ang2 levels in patients with inflammatory diseases and associations of Ang2 with inflammation markers in relatively small samples. We aimed to assess the relation of Ang2 and Tie2 with inflammation markers in the general population.
   Methods and results: Data of 6624 participants of the population-based Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP-1) and the independent SHIP-Trend were used. Ang2, Tie2 and inflammatory biomarkers, including fibrinogen, high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and white blood cell count (WBC), were measured. Adjusted analysis of variance (ANOVA) and linear/logistic regression models were performed in the entire sample and in individuals free of hypertension and diabetes. ANOVA [adjusted means of the 1st vs. 4th Ang2 quartile: fibrinogen 3.0 vs. 3.2 g/l; hsCRP 1.2 vs. 1.6 mg/l; WBC 5.9 vs. 6.6 Gpt/l] and regression models adjusted for potential confounders revealed positive relations of Ang2 with all considered inflammation markers. These associations persisted after the exclusion of individuals with hypertension and diabetes. In contrast, Tie2 showed no clear association pattern with the investigated inflammatory markers even if a trend toward a positive relation with fibrinogen became apparent.
   Conclusion: Ang2 was positively associated with fibrinogen, hsCRP and WBC in a large population-based setting. These findings partly agree with previous results, largely obtained in clinical samples. Ang2 has diverse postulated effects on inflammation processes, like increase of vascular leakage or influences on the adhesion of leukocytes to the vessel wall. The proinflammatory character of these effects is similar to these of fibrinogen which conforms to our findings of relations between the markers. However, further research is needed to elucidate possible functional mechanisms.

AB In sepsis, trauma and major surgery, where an explicit physiological insult leads to a significant systemic inflammatory response, the acute evolution of biomarkers have been delineated. In these settings, Interleukin (IL) -6 and TNF-alpha are often the first pro-inflammatory markers to rise, stimulating production of acute phase proteins followed by peaks in anti-inflammatory markers. Patients undergoing SPKT as a result of diabetic complications already have an inflammatory phenotype as a result of uraemia and glycaemia. How this inflammatory response is affected further by the trauma of major transplant surgery and how this may impact on graft survival is unknown, despite the recognised pro-inflammatory cytokines' detrimental effects on islet cell function. The aim of the study was to determine the evolution of biomarkers in omentum and serum in the peri-operative period following SPKT. The biochemical findings were correlated to clinical outcomes. Two omental biopsies were taken (at the beginning and end of surgery) and measured for CD68+ and CD206+ antibodies (M1 and M2 macrophages respectively). Serum was measured within the first 72 h post-SPKT for pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6,-10 and TNF-alpha), inflammatory markers (WCC and CRP) and endocrine markers (insulin, C-peptide, glucagon and resistin). 46 patients were recruited to the study. Levels of M1 (CD68+) and M2 (CD206+) macrophages were significantly raised at the end of surgery compared to the beginning (p = 0.003 and p < 0.001 respectively). Levels of C-peptide, insulin and glucagon were significantly raised 30 min post pancreas perfusion compared to baseline and were also significantly negatively related to prolonged cold ischaemic time (CIT) (p < 0.05). CRP levels correlated significantly with the Post-Operative Morbidity Survey (p < 0.05). The temporal inflammatory marker signature after SPKT is comparable to the pattern observed following other physiological insults. Unique to this study, we find that CIT is significantly related to early pancreatic endocrine function. In addition, this study suggests a predictive value of CRP in pen-operative morbidity following SPKT.

AB Background: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is considered a low-grade inflammatory disease. We aimed to identify effects of short-term strenuous exercise on mediators of systemic inflammation, endothelial and platelet activation in patients with angiographically verified CAD. We hypothesized that a more pronounced inflammatory response would be present in patients with CAD than in those without CAD.
   Methods: In subjects with symptoms indicative of stable CAD, an exercise stress test on a bicycle ergometer was performed. Venous blood samples, taken at rest and within 5 min after end of exercise, were analyzed for the following markers by ELISAs: TNF-alpha, IL-6, MCP-1, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-selectin, P-selectin, CD40L and RANTES. All participants underwent conventional coronary angiography. CAD was defined as having any degree of atherosclerosis.
   Results: A total of 110 patients were included, of whom 74 were found to have CAD. Mean exercise duration was 10:06 +/- 3:56 min with no significant difference between the two groups. All measured markers changed significantly during exercise (p <= 0.012). A significantly less pronounced increase in CD40L in the CAD group than in the no CAD group was observed (p = 0.050), however, after adjustment for hematocrit this difference was no longer significant.
   Conclusion: An instant inflammatory response was observed during short-term strenuous exercise in patients with symptoms of CAD. However, the exercise mediated response was not more pronounced in patients with CAD.

AB Purpose: Three tear supplements were compared for their effects on the signs, symptoms and inflammatory status of subjects with dry eye disease. Assessments were made before and after both 2 and 4 weeks of treatment.
   Methods: In this masked, randomized, 3-way crossover trial, eighteen dry eye subjects were recruited. At each visit, symptoms, tear evaporation rate, stability and osmolarity were measured and tear samples were analyzed for 7 inflammatory markers, using multiplex immunoassays. The 3 treatments included carboxymethylcellulose-glycerine-castor oil (CGC), carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) and hydroxypropyl guar (HPG). The CGC and HPG drops are emulsified lipids; CGC also contains osmoprotectants. The CMC drop is a standard aqueous polymeric supplement.
   Results: Significant improvements were seen in symptoms (OSDI) and tear stability (NITBUT) with all 3 treatments at 4 weeks. At 4 weeks post-CGC, 6 out of 7 biomarkers demonstrated a > 25% reduction (in 40% of subjects). The same reduction (> 25%) was seen in 10% of the subjects for CMC and in none of the subjects for HPG. No significantly different change to either evaporation rate or tear osmolarity was found following any of the three treatments.
   Conclusions: In this study, the CGC treatment resulted in the greatest reduction in ocular biomarkers of inflammation, while all 3 treatments reduced symptoms and improved tear stability. These results indicate that subject-perceived symptomatic improvements are not necessarily associated with a reduction in objective measures of inflammation.

AB Generally regarded as commensal bacteria, the pathogenicity of Ureaplasma has often been considered low. Controversy remains concerning the clinical relevance of Ureaplasma infection in the pathogenesis of inflammation-related morbidities. Recently, we demonstrated Ureaplasma-driven pro-inflammatory cytokine responses in human monocytes in vitro. We hypothesized that Ureaplasma may induce further inflammatory mediators. Using qRT-PCR and multi-analyte immunoassay, we assessed the expression of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) in term neonatal and adult monocytes exposed to Ureaplasma urealyticum serovar 8 (Uu8) and U. parvum serovar 3 (Up3). Ureaplasma significantly induced VEGF mRNA in neonatal (Up3: p < 0.05, versus broth control) and adult monocytes (Uu8: p < 0.05) as well as ICAM-1 mRNA in neonatal cells (p < 0.05 each). As far as protein expression was concerned, Up3 stimulated VEGF release in both monocyte subsets (p < 0.01) and enhanced secretion of ICAM-1 protein in neonatal monocytes (p < 0.05). In adult cells, ICAM-1 protein release was increased upon exposure to both isolates (Uu8: p < 0.05, Up3: p < 0.01). Ureaplasma-induced responses did not significantly differ from corresponding levels mediated by E. soli lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The stimulatory effects were dose-dependent. Ureaplasma infection, on the contrary, did not affect G-CSF and VCAM-1 expression. Of note, co-infection of LPS-primed neonatal monocytes with Ureaplasma enhanced LPS-induced ICAM-1 release (Uu8: p < 0.05). Our results confirm Ureaplasma-driven pro-inflammatory activation of human monocytes in vitro, demonstrating a differential modulation of growth factors and cell adhesion molecules, that might promote unbalanced monocyte responses and adverse immunomodulation.

AB Murine/LPS models of Gram negative sepsis indicate that vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) has therapeutic potential. We investigated the unknown effect of VIP on JAK/STAT proteins and genes in human monocytes infected with Salmonella Typhimurium 14028. S. Typhimurium 14028 increased expression of both IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) and interferon gamma receptor 1 (IFN gamma R1) on monocytes but co-culture of infected monocytes with VIP (10(-7) M) only decreased expression of IFN gamma R1 (P < 0.05). In contrast, S. Typhimurium 14028 infection or co-culture with VIP had no effect on IL-10 receptor expression on the monocyte surface. However, S. Typhimurium 14028 down regulated IFNGR1 gene expression and this was not altered by co-culture with VIP, suggesting that changes in IFN gamma R1 protein may be due to an effect on cytoplasmic transport.
   15 JAK/STAT genes, out of 84 studied, were up-regulated by S. Typhimurium 14028 infection and five were down-regulated. Co-culture with VIP significantly decreased expression of two genes (IFNG and IL-20) and increased expression of three genes (SOCS1, SOCS3 and STAT4) (P < 0.05). S. Typhimurium 14028 also increased expression of PTPN1, which dephosphorylates JAK2 and TYK2. This was unaltered by co-culture with VIP but S. Typhimurium 14028-induced expression of ISG15, associated with susceptibility to Gram negative infection, was further increased by VIP.
   We conclude that the effect of VIP on JAK/STAT genes may preclude its therapeutic use in human Gram negative sepsis.

AB Low concentrations of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) have been reported in patients with hematological malignancies. However, the proof of decreased HDL-C in hematological malignancies and its association with clinical outcomes remain unclear. We analyzed 140 Japanese patients with malignant lymphoma (ML) and adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATLL). HDL-C, LDL-C and soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) were measured. Treatment decisions were determined with established protocols. HDL-C was 0.98 +/- 0.45 mmol/l in patients and 1.51 +/- 0.35 mmol/l in controls (P < 0.001). LDL-C was lower in patients than in controls (2.76 +/- 0.96, 3.16 +/- 0.76 mmol/l, respectively, P < 0.001). HDL-C was the lowest in ATLL (0.81 +/- 0.37 mmol/l), modest in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (1.09 +/- 0.42 mmol/l) and the highest in Hodgkin's disease (1.14 +/- 0.68 mmol/l), (P = 0.0019). Inverse correlation was found between HDL-C and sIL-2R (r = 0.6584, P < 0.001). Categorized patients into 3 subgroups according to HDL-C (< 0.52, 0.52-1.02 and >= 1.03 mmol/l), sIL-2R were the highest (median, 36,675; IQR, 17,180-92,600 U/mL) in patients with HDL-C < 0.52 mmol/l, modest (2386, 1324-8340) in HDL-C 0.52-1.02 mmol/l and the lowest (761, 450-1596) in HDL-C 1.03 mmol/l (P < 0.001). In Cox regression model, the lowest HDL-C levels, < 0.52 mmol/l, were associated with poorer clinical outcome and the hazard ratio was 5.73 (95%CI, 3.09-10.50; P < 0.001). In Kaplan-Meier analysis according to HDL-C tertiles (< 0.78, 0.78-1.10 and >= 1.11 mmol/l), patients with lowest HDL-C tertile showed inferior overall survival with a median follow-up of 23 months (P < 0.001). We concluded that cytokine-induced low levels of HDL-C in patients with ML and ATLL has independent prognostic significance, and suggesting an early indicator of poorer outcome.

AB Background: Omega-3 fatty acids have the potential to decrease inflammation and modify gene transcription. Whether docosahexanoic acid (DHA) supplementation can modify systemic inflammatory and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) gene expression in HIV-infected patients is unknown.
   Methods: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 84 antiretroviral-treated patients who had fasting TG levels from 2.26 to 5.65 mmol/l and received DHA or placebo for 48 weeks was performed (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02005900). Systemic inflammatory and SAT gene expression was assessed at baseline and at week 48 in 39 patients.
   Results: Patients receiving DHA had a 43.9% median decline in fasting TG levels at week 4 (IQR: -31% to -56%), compared with -2.9% (-18.6% to 16.5%) in the placebo group (P < 0.0001). High sensitivity C reactive protein (hsCRP) and arachidonic acid levels significantly decreased in the DHA group. Adipogenesis-related and mitochondrial-related gene expression did not experience significant changes. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) significantly decreased in the placebo group. SAT inflammation-related gene expression (Tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-alpha], and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 [MCP-1]) significantly decreased in the DHA group.
   Conclusions: DHA supplementation down-regulated inflammatory gene expression in SAT. DHA impact on markers of systemic inflammation was restricted to hsCRP and arachidonic acid.

AB Dense mat formed by duckweeds is a significant threat to fisheries, landscape, ecological environment, and economies around the world. Effective biological management strategies to control duckweeds are quite limited. In the present study, we determined the effect of the extract of Coptis chinensis, a traditional Chinese medicinal herb, on the growth of duckweed (Spirodela polyrhiza). The growth of S. polyrhiza was strongly inhibited by the C. chinensis extract. The number of fronds and fresh weight of the plants were significantly decreased after a 96-h treatment. Furthermore, the chlorophyll (a, b, and a + b) content was remarkably decreased by the C. chinensis extract. The 24-, 48-, 72- and 96-h-IC50 of the C. chinensis extract to S. polyrhiza were 6.56, 1.06, 0.81, and 0.33 g DW eq. extract L-1, respectively. In addition, the C. chinensis extract was found to be safer for the submerged macrophytes (such as Vallisneria natans: 96-h-EC50 was 10.39 g DW eq. extract L-1) and aquatic animals (such as zebrafish: 96-h-LC50 was 20.35 g DW eq. extract L-1). These results showed that the C. chinensis extract was inhibitory to the growth and reproduction of S. polyrhiza. Moreover, the field test results also confirmed that the inhibitory effect of C. chinensis extract on S. polyrhiza. Thus, we recommend the use of the C. chinensis extract as an effective and safe botanical herbicide for duckweed management in water ecosystems.

AB Green infrastructure and in particular green roofs are crucial to meet the challenge of sustainable urbanisation fostered by the current European Research and Innovation agenda. Several documents were issued in the last decades in Europe for regulating the design, construction and up-keep of roof greening. In particular, the actual German guidelines have been widely adopted as a reference basis for green roof design and regulation worldwide, because of its exhaustiveness and proven building- and landscaping tradition. With the aim to assess the effectiveness of green roof guidelines and norms in supporting plant and soil biodiversity in different ecoregions, and particularly of the Mediterranean one, the German guidelines, the Swiss and Italian norms are screened and discussed in this paper. The German guidelines were chosen for their traditional referential role, the Swiss norm for its peculiar biodiversity approach, the Italian one for its application on a territory with remarkably heterogeneous environmental conditions, stretching from Alpine to Mediterranean ecosystems. Even if the three documents at comparison addressed to some extent biodiversity-related matters, none of them deepened the relationship between plant species selection (local ecotypes), growing medium composition (materials, granular size and thickness) and system build-ups (multi-layers and/or single-layer systems). This is a crucial point for countries, like Italy, encompassing very different climatic conditions. It was concluded that at the current knowledge a guideline/norm taking into account the peculiarities of green roof design in the Mediterranean ecoregion has to be widely refined.

AB The effects of cropping patterns of four terrestrial plants (Artemisia selengensis, Trifolium repens, Houttuynia cordata and Medicago sativa) on purifying vanadium-containing wastewater co-polluted by V, Cr, Cd and Pb along with their impact pathway was investigated. The results revealed that reasonable cropping pattern could significantly improve the efficiency of phytoremediation for wastewater, which was depended on three factors, namely, total biomass, metal concentration in plants and metal adsorption at root surface. Pattern VII (3:4:1:2, plants mass ratio) showed the best purification effect with 74.15% V, 78.78% Cr, 53.09% Cd and 91.25% Pb removal for the first influent. The root adsorption contributed 57.96%, 46.66%, 41.27% and 49.35% to the total removal of V, Cr, Cd, and Pb. By contrast, in pattern III (2:2:4:2), the maximum plant uptake pattern, only 33.84% V, 29.68% Cr, 18.33% Cd and 35.84% Pb removed from the wastewater were contributed by root adsorption. Our research may open up further scope of utilizing co-cropping of plants for enhancing phytoremediation of metals co-contaminated wastewater. The possible mechanism involves processes that would improve rhizosphere environment, such as the activities of rhizosphere microbes, root exudates, pH and redox potential, by reasonable co-planting.

AB Winery wastewater is of great concern due to its complex composition, characterized by high organic content and high amounts of readily and slowly biodegradable and recalcitrant compounds. In the present study, the culturable bacteria from rhizo (interstitial water and substrate) and endosphere (inside roots and shoots) of Iris pseudacorus plants inhabiting a treatment wetland mesocosm receiving winery wastewater, were isolated and identified. The innovative approach combined the use of these plants with a substrate based on used cork stoppers, as a support.
   Of the 53 bacterial isolates retrieved from the rhizo (interstitial water and substrate) and endosphere (root and shoot) of I. pseudacorus plants, the class gamma-Proteobacteria was predominant in the shoot and root tissues (72%), but it was also present in the interstitial water and substrate (28%). In total, 13 different genera were found. Pseudomonas and Bacillus were the most represented genera in the rhizosphere while Rahnella and Pseudomonas were dominant in the endosphere of Iris plants. Plant tissues and the water-substrate shared 31% of the genera. Used cork stoppers supported plant growth and can be valorized as substrate in constructed vegetated systems for wastewater treatment and future bioremediation developments may be assisted by the use of resilient bacteria retrieved from such harsh environments.

AB Alterations of riparian areas of running waters resulted in fragmentation of the riverscape. The possible impact of climate change additionally stresses the importance for conservation planning for riparian habitats, especially for sessile plant species. The survival of species under changing habitat availability can be counteracted by ensuring functional connectivity of riparian plant species. This study applies a coupled modelling framework using species distribution models and dispersal simulations, which allow to analyze the potential future distribution of species in relation to their ecological niche, life history traits including dispersal abilities as well as barriers to dispersal such as dams. Modelled suitable habitats for six riparian plant species characteristic for the olive willow plant community (Salicion elaeagni) showed dramatic changes under the impact of two climate change scenarios. While habitat suitability remained low for species with a narrow ecological niche, it increased under climate change scenarios for species which are also found in secondary habitat outside riparian areas. Simulations of dispersal to the potential future habitat revealed nevertheless high numbers of decolonized cells after 80 years of dispersal for species with high future habitat suitability. This stresses the importance of a joint investigation of the habitat suitability under climate change scenarios, dispersal parameters as well as life history traits for conservation planning of riparian species. The simulated future distribution revealed that barriers along rivers have a significant negative effect on the spread of the studied plant species. Our results suggest that conservation management should focus on providing connected stepping stone habitats for riparian plant species along rivers, as current species occurrences are not persistent over time.

AB Fishways play an increasingly important role in restoring free passages in rivers for aquatic organisms, especially fishes. Effective fishway operations are the prerequisite for the restoration of fragmented habitats. Research has shown that most existing fishways in China are not functioning correctly. In order to facilitate the successful operation of fishways, this paper discusses several key issues, such as swimming capabilities and behaviors of migratory fishes, fishway entrance position and structure type, downstream migration, and fishway siltation. In addition, the author provides directions for future fishway research in China.

AB Excess nutrients commonly lead to eutrophication and harmful algal blooms. Stream restoration is increasingly popular for nutrient removal enhancing exchange with the reactive hyporheic zone. Hyporheic reactions such as denitrification are often transport-limited and instream restoration structures have been proposed to enhance hyporheic exchange and nutrient removal. However, the comparative effects of instream structure types and watershed setting (i.e. environmental characteristics such as sediment hydraulic conductivity, stream slope) are still poorly understood. Here we used MIKE SHE to model groundwater and surface water interaction and nitrate removal (denitrification) in a 200 m second order stream reach. We simulated various in-stream structures (channel-spanning weirs, partially spanning structures such as cross veins, buried structures) and investigated the effect of controlling environmental characteristics that vary with watershed setting. We found that the environmental characteristics had the greatest effect on surface water-groundwater exchange and therefore denitrification, including streambed hydraulic conductivity, natural or background stream topography and slope, and groundwater levels. Type and number of instream structures also influenced surface water-groundwater exchange and denitrification, but to a lesser degree. Human effects at the watershed scale from agriculture and urbanization likely play a role in whether reach-scale restoration practices succeed in achieving water quality goals both through effect on exchange itself (e.g., altering bed sediment texture) and on nitrate sources. More broadly, restoration efforts at the watershed scale itself, such as reducing fertilizer use or improving stormwater management, may be necessary to achieve ambitious water quality goals. Nevertheless, reach-scale restoration efforts such as in-stream structures may play a useful role in certain watershed settings, for example where groundwater conditions induce neither strong gaining nor strong losing conditions. The interaction of reachscale modifications and watershed setting must be understood to optimize nutrient removal from stream restoration through enhanced hyporheic exchange.

TI Downstream fish passage guide walls: A hydraulic scale model analysis
SO ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING

DT Article
DE Fish passage; Hydraulic models; Velocity measurements; Guide walls;

ID HYDROPOWER DAMS
AB Partial-depth guide walls are used to improve passage efficiency and reduce the delay of out-migrating anadromous fish species by guiding fish to a bypass route (i.e. weir, pipe, sluice gate) that circumvents the turbine intakes, where survival is usually lower. Evaluation and monitoring studies, however, indicate a high propensity for some fish to pass underneath, rather than along, the guide walls, compromising their effectiveness. In the present study we evaluated a range of guide wall structures to identify where/if the flow field shifts from sweeping (i.e. flow direction primarily along the wall and towards the bypass) to downward-dominant. Many migratory fish species, particularly juveniles, are known to drift with the flow and/or exhibit rheotactic behaviour during their migration. When these behaviours are present, fish follow the path of the flow field. Hence, maintaining a strong sweeping velocity in relation to the downward velocity along a guide wall is essential to successful fish guidance. Nine experiments were conducted to measure the three-dimensional velocity components upstream of a scale model guide wall set at a wide range of depths and angles to flow. Results demonstrated how each guide wall configuration affected the three-dimensional velocity components, and hence the downward and sweeping velocity, along the full length of the guide wall. In general, the velocities produced in the scale model were sweeping dominant near the water surface and either downward dominant or close to the transitional depth near the bottom of the guide wall. The primary exception to this shift from sweeping do downward flow was for the minimum guide wall angle tested in this study (15 degrees). At 15 degrees the flow pattern was fully sweeping dominant for every cross-section, indicating that a guide wall with a relatively small angle may be more likely to produce conditions favorable to efficient guidance. A critical next step is to evaluate the behaviour of migratory fish as they approach and swim along a guide wall in a controlled laboratory environment.

AB Diamond-like carbon (DLC) films and nanocrystalline silver particles containing diamond-like carbon (DLC:Ag) films were electrodeposited on n-type silicon substrate (n-Si) to prepare n-Si/DLC and n-Si/DLC:Ag heterostructures for photovoltaic (PV) applications. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect in this cell structure and its overall performance have been studied in terms of morphology, optical absorption, current-voltage characteristics, capacitance-voltage characteristics, band diagram and external quantum efficiency measurements. Localized surface plasmon resonance effect of silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) in n-Si/DLC:Ag PV structure exhibited an enhancement of similar to 28% in short circuit current density (J(SC)), which improved the overall efficiency of the heterostructures.

AB Density functional theory calculations of dodecaboronyldodecaborate (B-12(BO)(12)(2-)) were performed to examine its electronic properties. Formation of this dianion with unusually high stability was accomplished by substituting boronyl (BO) for H in a typical dianion, B12H122-. The binding energy of the second electron of the B-12(BO)(12)(2-) dianion was 5.89 eV (PBE0/def2-TZVP) and 5.96 eV (MN12-SX/def2-TZVP); this represents its stability and is the largest value reported to date. We clarify that the high stability of B-12(BO)(12)(2-) originates from the weak pi orbital interaction character of the BO ligand. All calculated results clearly indicate the deficient pi orbital interaction ability of BO. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Noteworthy, it is the first time to declare that fullerene isomer Cs(126339)-C-92 could be considered as the suitable cage to encapsulate metallic cluster. The electronic properties of these three isomers were performed with frontier molecular orbital (HOMO and LUMO) analyses and bond order calculations.

The molecular structure and geometric parameters were determined by some computational methods such as B3LY P/6-31 + G(3df,p), HF/aug-cc-pvtz and MP2/6-31G(d). Detailed elucidation of the structural and spectroscopic properties of 4-cpba was carried out with H-1, HETCOR and DOSY NMR experiments. Solvent effects on the structural properties were monitored on the changes of 1H NMR spectra by using various solvents and it was observed that 4-cpba shows serious structural preferences depending on the solvent used.

AB Wave functions of a new functional kind has been proposed in this work for helium-like atoms. These functions depend explicitly on interelectronic and hyperspherical coordinates. The best ground state energy for the helium atom -2.903724376677a.u. has been calculated using the variational method with a basis including a single exponential parameter. To our knowledge, this is the best result so far using of hyperspherical coordinates. Comparable result has been obtained for the hydrogen anion. For helium atom, our best wave functions matched the Kato cusp conditions within an accuracy below 6.10(-4). An important feature of proposed wave functions is the inclusion of negative powers of R = root(r(1)(2) + r(2)(2)) in combination with positive powers of r(12) into the wave function. We showed that this is necessary condition for proposed wave function to be a formal solution of Schrodinger equation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Transient spectra data shows that intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) takes place from TPA units to beta-diketones units after photoexcitation. Increasing the number of electron acceptor units would prolong the generation process of ICT state, and accelerate the excited molecule reorganization process and the relaxation process of ICT state.

AB The reaction mechanism of the O-2 formation in the S-4 state of the oxygen-evolving complex of photosystem II was clarified at the quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) level. After the Yz (Y161) oxidation and the following proton transfer in the S-3 state, five reaction steps are required to produce the molecular dioxygen. The highest barrier step is the first proton transfer reaction (0 -> 1). The following reactions involving electron transfers were precisely analyzed in terms of their energies, structures and spin densities. We found that the one-electron transfer from the Mn4Ca cluster to Y161 triggers the O-O sigma bond formation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Titanium-nitrogen complexes were generated by laser ablated titanium (Ti) atoms and N-2 gas molecules in this study. These complexes were isolated on the pre-deposited solid Ar matrix on the pre-cooled KBr window (T similar to 5.4 K), allowing infrared spectra to be measured. Laser ablation experiments with N-15(2) isotope provided distinct isotopic shifts in the infrared spectra that strongly implicated the formation of titanium-nitrogen complexes, Ti(NN)(x). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were employed to investigate the molecular structures, electronic ground state, relative energies, and IR frequencies of the anticipated Ti(NN)(x) complexes. Based on laser ablation experiments and DFT calculations, we were able to assign multiple Ti(NN)(x) (x = 1-6) species. Particularly, Ti(NN)(5) and Ti(NN)(6), which have high nitrogen content, may serve as good precursors in preparing polynitrogens. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The fragment of the 1-methylpyrene cation, C17H11+, is expected to exist in two isomeric forms, 1-pyrenemethylium PyrCH(2)(+) and the tropylium containing species PyrC(7)(+). We measured the infrared (IR) action spectrum of cold C17H11+ tagged with Ne using a cryogenic ion trap instrument coupled to the FELIX laser. Comparison of the experimental data with density functional theory calculations allows us to identify the PyrCH(2)(+) isomer in our experiments. The IR Multi-Photon Dissociation spectrum was also recorded following the C2H2 loss channel. Its analysis suggests combined effects of anharmonicity and isomerisation while heating the trapped ions, as shown by molecular dynamics simulations. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB By means of first-principles approach, we systematically investigate the effect of Cr and Al on the oxidation resistance of WSi2. The interstice sites oxygen prefers to occupy are considered. Moreover, Cr and Al tend to occupy the Si sites of WSi2, and they are thermodynamically stable. The oxygen diffusion in various interstitial sites of undoped and doped WSi2 are studied, respectively. Importantly, Cr and Al can improve oxidation resistance of WSi2 obviously, and Cr, Al co-doped system has the best oxidation resistance. The improvement of oxidation resistance is attributed to the formation of Al-O and Cr-O bonds. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We investigated the dynamical and polarizable properties of Li7P3S11, which is a fast Li-conducting material, by performing ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. A zone analysis based on Li migration highlighted the effective path along which Li diffuses in the crystal. The effective Li diffusion was analyzed in terms of the dynamics and polarizability of the sulfur surrounding the Li migration path. High flexibility and large anisotropic polarizability were the characteristics identified as necessary for the formation of an effective Li migration path. These findings provide principles for understanding Li conduction in solid-state electrolytes. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The interaction energies of the resulting complexes are between -7.70 and - 15.59 kcal/mol. The nature of BAB interactions is identified by the molecular electrostatic potential, quantum theory of atoms in molecules, noncovalent interaction index and natural bond orbital analyses. The mutual influence between the BAB and a halogen, chalcogen, pnicogen or tetrel bonding interaction is also studied in systems where these interactions coexist. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Organic field effect transistors consisting of Poly [N-9'-heptadecanyl-2, 7-carbazole-alt-5, 5-(4', 7'-di-2-thienyl- 2', 1', 3'-benzothiadiazole] (PCDTBT) as active layer have been fabricated for detection of gases. The device exhibited highly selective response towards parts-per-million level of NO2 gas. For these devices response towards NO2 decreases with increasing gate bias due to the existing high density of free charges. A model has been developed to explain this variation of response with gate bias using transfer characteristics of the device (in air). This model enables to determine the density of holes released in PCDTBT layer on interaction with NO2 gas. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The production, diffusion, and interaction of particle beam induced water-derived radicals is studied with the a pre-chemical and chemical module of the Monte Carlo particle track structure code TRAX, based on a step by step approach. After a description of the model implemented, the chemical evolution of the most important products of water radiolysis is studied for electron, proton, helium, and carbon ion radiation at different energies. The validity of the model is verified by comparing the calculated time and LET dependent yield with experimental data from literature and other simulation approaches. (C) 2018 The Authors.

AB Stability of BeBH3 and MgBH3 molecules and their (BeBH3)(-) and (MgBH3)(-) anions is investigated on the basis of correlated ab initio calculations. The electronic and thermodynamic stability of all species is confirmed by estimating the excess electron binding energies of the anions and by evaluating the Gibbs free energies for various fragmentation paths. The bonding effects in BeBH3 and MgBH3 have been identified as the result of alkaline earth metal ns(2) lone-pair donation to the empty 2p boron orbital. Adiabatic and vertical electronic stabilities of the (BeBH3)(-) and (MgBH3)(-) anions were found to span 1.114-1.301 and 0.675-0.744 eV range, respectively. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Polymer nanocomposites of Poly (styrene co-acrylonitrile)/Nickel Oxide (PSAN/NiO) have been prepared. The increased free volume sizes up to 0.4 wt% of NiO loading indicates overall reduction in packing density of polymer network. The decreased o-Ps lifetime (tau(3)) at higher concentration of NiO indicates improved interfacial interaction between the surface of NiO nanoparticles and side chain of PSAN polymer matrix. The increased AC/DC conductivity at lower wt% of NiO loading demonstrates increased number of electric charge carriers/mobile ions and their mobility. The increased dielectric constant and dielectric loss up to 0.4 wt% of NiO loading suggests the increased dipoles polarization. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ//MP2/cc-pVDZ potential-energy profile of the bimolecular reaction of cis- and trans-trifluoromethylhydroxycarbene, shows the lowest gas-phase barrier height of 13 kJ mol(-1) compared to the recently reported value of 128 kJ mol(-1) for the unimolecular reaction. We expect bimolecular reactions of carbene's stereoisomers will open a valuable field for new and useful synthetic strategies. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Evolutionary algorithm is combined with full-potential ab initio calculations to investigate conformational space of (MoS2)(n) and (MoSe2)(n) (n = 1-10) nanoclusters and to identify the lowest energy structural isomers of these systems. It is argued that within both BLYP and PBE functionals, these nanoclusters favor sandwiched planar configurations, similar to their ideal planar sheets. The second order difference in total energy (Delta E-2) of the lowest energy isomers is computed to estimate the abundance of the clusters at different sizes and to determine the magic sizes of (MoS2)(n) and (MoSe2)(n) nanoclusters. In order to investigate the electronic properties of nanoclusters, their energy gap is calculated by several methods, including hybrid functionals (B3LYP and PBE0), GW approach, and Delta scf method. At the end, the vibrational modes of the lowest lying isomers are calculated by using the force constants method and the IR active modes of the systems are identified. The vibrational spectra are used to calculate the Helmholtz free energy of the systems and then to investigate abundance of the nanoclusters at finite temperatures. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The translation of Li/Li+ through Al12P12 nano-cages is not only a kinetically feasible process but also has very high separation ratio in the favor of lithium atom over lithium ion. Adsorption/encapsulation energies of alkali metal on/in nano-cages show strong correlation with the size of the nano-cage. The percent changes in H-L gap for Li+-X12Y12 are about 1-25%, whereas the corresponding changes for Li-X12Y12 are 30-72%. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The Eyring's rate process theory and free volume concept are employed to treat protons (or other particles) transporting through a 2D (two dimensional) crystal like graphene and hexagonal boron nitride. The protons are assumed to be activated first in order to participate conduction and the conduction rate is dependent on how much free volume available in the system. The obtained proton conductivity equations show that only the number of conduction protons, proton size and packing structure, and the energy barrier associated with 2D crystals are critical; the quantization conductance is unexpectedly predicted with a simple Arrhenius type temperature dependence. The predictions agree well with experimental observations and clear out many puzzles like much smaller energy barrier determined from experiments than from the density function calculations and isotope separation rate independent of the energy barrier of 2D crystals, etc. Our work may deepen our understandings on how protons transport through a membrane and has direct implications on hydrogen related technology and proton involved bioprocesses.

AB Correlation between the structural/electronic structure properties and bio-activity of graphene-based materials need to be thoroughly evaluated before their commercial implementation in the health and environment precincts. To better investigate the local hybridization of sp(2)/sp(3) orbitals of the functional groups of graphene-oxide (GO) and their execution in the antimicrobial mechanism, we exemplify the antibacterial activity of GO sheets towards the Escherichia coli bacteria (E. coli) by applying the field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) and scanning transmission X-ray microscope (STXM) techniques. C K-edge and O K-edge NEXAFS spectra have revealed lesser sp(2) carbon atoms in the aromatic ring and attachment of functional oxygen groups at GO sheets. Entrapment of E. coli bacteria by GO sheets is evidenced by FESEM investigations and has also been corroborated by nano-scale imaging of bacteria using the STXM. Spectroscopy evidence of functional oxygen moieties with GO sheets and physiochemical entrapment of E. coli bacteria have assisted us to elaborate the mechanism of cellular oxidative stress-induced disruption of bacterial membrane.

SO CHEMICAL PHYSICS LETTERS

ID ATOMIC-HYDROGEN; ADSORPTION; DENSITY; SET
AB In their article, Xu et al. (2006) present the adsorption energies for the chemisorption of the three halogens F-2, Cl-2, and Br-2 on the active sites of graphite. The three investigated systems are the three most stable surfaces, (001), (100), and (110); the latter two are also called zigzag and armchair surface, respectively. Due to some inconsistencies in their article, we re-evaluated the results of Xu et al. in order to investigate the impact on the adsorption energies of the halogens. For the (001) surface, our results agree with Xu et al. However, for the other two surfaces we find major differences. Contrary to Xu et al., we find that the halogens adsorb the strongest on the zigzag surface. The second strongest adsorption is found on the armchair surface for the symmetric configurations, the third strongest for the asymmetric configurations. Several reasons are given which explain this discrepancy. The most striking source of error in the work of Xu et al. is due to the fact that they did not choose the correct spin multiplicities for the model systems which means that they performed the calculations in excited states. This leads to errors between 50 and 600% for the zigzag surface and 3-42% for the armchair surface. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB DFT study on O-2 adsorption on a nanocrystalline titania is presented for the first time. The dioxide's nanoparticle is modeled via the nanocluster Ti8O16. According to the calculations, O-2 physisorbs on the nanocluster Ti8O16 in S-0 and T-0 states and chemisorbs on the nanocluster in S-1 state. The computed adsorption enthalpies, O-2 vibrational frequencies, and O-2 g-tensor agree well with available data. In contrast to the axial O-2 orientation on a surface of titania with oxygen vacancies, in the chemisorption complex O-2 is oriented laterally. We explain this by the sterical hindrance of the Ti3+ centers in the former case. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Hemin-graphite oxide-carbon nanotube (hemin-GO-CNT) and hemin-thermally reduced graphite oxidecarbon nanotube (hemin-TRGO-CNT) composites are synthesized and investigated for the electrochemical supramolecular recognition by electron transfer between biomolecules (dopamine and hydrogen peroxide) and the composite electrodes. Redox reaction mechanisms of two composites with dopamine and hydrogen peroxide are explained in detail by using cyclic voltammetry and differential pulse voltammetry. Hemin-TRGO-CNT displays higher electrochemical detection for dopamine and hydrogen peroxide than that of hemin-GO-CNT, exhibiting enhancement of the electron transfer due to the effective immobilization of redox couple of hemin (Fe2+/Fe3+) on the TRGO-CNT surface.

AB Suitable conformations for peptide nucleic acid (PNA) self-hybrids with (2'R,4'R)- and (2'R,4'S)-prolyl(1S,2S)-2-aminocyclopentanecarboxylic acid backbones (namely, acpcPNA and epi-acpcPNA, respectively) were investigated based on molecular dynamics simulations. The results revealed that hybridization of the acpcPNA was observed only in the parallel direction, with a conformation close to the P-type structure. In contrast, self-hybrids of the epi-acpcPNA were formed in the antiparallel and parallel directions; the antiparallel duplex adopted the B-form conformation, and the parallel duplex was between Band P-forms. The calculated binding energies and the experimental data indicate that the antiparallel epiacpc-PNA self-hybrid was more stable than the parallel duplex. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Silver (Ag) nanoparticles decorated Zinc oxide (A-ZnO) nanowires have been successfully synthesized by two-step chemical vapour deposition and magnetron sputtering method. The X-ray diffraction patterns revealed their hexagonal wurtzite structure. SEM images indicated the Ag nanoparticles are distributed uniformly on the surface of A-ZnO nanowires. By extending the sputtering time, the atomic percent of Ag increased gradually. Moreover, the photoluminescence results demonstrated two major emission peaks for the A-ZnO nanowires. Where, the visible emission peaks were stronger than those of unmodified ZnO nanowires. These studies promise their potential applications in multifunctional optical devices. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB We study electron transfer between two separated protons using local control theory. In this symmetric system one can favour a slow transfer by biasing the algorithm, achieving high efficiencies for fixed nuclei. The solution can be parametrized using a sequence of a pump followed by a dump pulse that lead to tunneling-induced electron transfer. Finally, we study the effect of the nuclear kinetic energy on the efficiency. Even in the absence of relative motion between the protons, the spreading of the nuclear wave function is enough to reduce the yield of electronic transfer to less than one half.

AB Large-scale graphitic thin film with high thickness uniformity needs to be developed for industrial applications. Graphitic films with thicknesses ranging from 3 to 20 nm have rarely been reported, and achieving the thickness uniformity in that range is a challenging task. In this study, a process for growing 20 nm-thick graphite films on Ni with improved thickness uniformity is demonstrated and compared with the conventional growth process. In the film grown by the process, the surface roughness and coverage were improved and no wrinkles were observed. Observations of the film structure reveal the reasons for the improvements and growth mechanisms. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB An explicitly-correlated method of calculation of excited states with spin-orbit couplings, has been formulated and implemented. Developed approach utilizes left and right eigenvectors of equation-of-motion coupled-cluster model, which is based on the linearly approximated explicitly correlated coupled-cluster singles and doubles [CCSD(F12)] method. The spin-orbit interactions are introduced by using the spin-orbit mean field (SOMF) approximation of the Breit-Pauli Hamiltonian. Numerical tests for several atoms and molecules show good agreement between explicitly-correlated results and the corresponding values, calculated in complete basis set limit (CBS); the highly-accurate excitation energies can be obtained already at triple-zeta level.

AB The diffusion regime (sub-diffusive, standard, or super-diffusive) is defined by the order of the derivative in the corresponding transport equation. We develop an accurate computational method for the direct estimation of the diffusion regime. The method is based on the derivative order estimation using the asymptotic analytic solutions of the diffusion equation with the integer order and the time-fractional derivatives. The robustness and the computational cheapness of the proposed method are verified using the experimental methane and methyl alcohol transport kinetics through the catalyst pellet.

AB Ga nanoparticles and Ge nanostructures have been electrodeposited from 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([EMIm]Tf2N) ionic liquid with pulsed laser assistance. Laser irradiation led to clustering and vertical growth of Ga nanospheres, and formation of Ge nanowires and branched nanowires. Ge nanowires were also electrodeposited on a Cu foil under laser irradiation. The as-prepared Ge nanowires film anode yielded an initial discharge and charge capacity of 1646 mAh/g and 1278 mAh/g, respectively, and retained nearly 70% of the original charge capacity after 50 cycles at 0.2 C.

AB Design of red organic emitting molecules with characteristic of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) remains a great challenge. Here, electronic and optical properties of a series of multi-branched TADF molecules have been investigated based on the newly-proposed optimal Hartree-Fock percentage method. Results show that, though enlarging the delocalization of HOMO and LUMO, the emission wavelength is redshift. The designed red TADF molecule possesses smaller reorganization energy than these for reported molecules. This indicates the non-radiative energy consumption of excited state is small and effective luminescence can be expected. Thus, a promising red thermally activated delayed fluorescence molecule is proposed. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Elastic and thermodynamic properties of negative thermal expansion (NTE) alpha-ZrW2O8 have been calculated using PBEsol and PBE exchange-correlation functionals within the framework of density functional perturbation theory (DFPT). Measured elastic constants are reproduced within similar to 2% with PBEsol and similar to 6% with PBE. The thermal evolution of the Gruneisen parameter computed within the quasi-harmonic approximation exhibits negative values below the Debye temperature, consistent with observation. The standard molar heat capacity is predicted to be C-P(0) = 192.2 and 193.8 J mol(-1) K-1 with PBEsol and PBE, respectively. These results suggest superior accuracy of DFPT/PBEsol for studying the lattice dynamics, elasticity and thermodynamics of NTE materials. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Understanding the structural, geometrical, and chemical changes that occur after an electronic excitation is essential to elucidate the inherent mechanism of nitro explosives. Herein, relaxed structures of typical nitro explosives in the lowest singlet excited state are investigated using time-dependent density functional theory. During the excitation process, the nitro group is activated and relaxes via geometrical change. The five explosives RDX, HMX, CL-20, PETN, and LLM-105 exhibit similar relaxed structures, and the impact sensitivity is related to their excitation energy. High-sensitivity delta-HMX has a lower excitation energy for relaxed structure than beta-HMX. This study offers novel insight into energetic materials. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The gas-phase enthalpies of formation of four molecules with high flexibility, which leads to the existence of a large number of low-energy conformers, were calculated with the G4 method to see whether the lowest energy conformer is sufficient to achieve high accuracy in the computed values. The calculated values were in good agreement with the experiment, whereas adding the correction for conformer distribution makes the agreement worse. The reason for this effect is a large anharmonicity of low-frequency torsional motions, which is ignored in the calculation of ZPVE and thermal enthalpy. It was shown that the approximate correction for anharmonicity estimated using a free rotor model is of very similar magnitude compared with the conformer correction but has the opposite sign, and thus almost fully compensates for it. Therefore, the common practice of adding only the conformer correction is not without problems. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We performed metadynamics molecular dynamics simulations to reveal mechanism of antigen-dependent fluorescence response observed for site-specifically fluorescent-labeled single-chain antibody against c-Myc peptide antigen. We found that V-H and V-L bind with each other only when the antigen exists and that the fluorophore labeled at the N-terminus of V-H interacts with Trp103 most stably. These results support the mechanism proposed from previous experiments: In the absence of antigen, Trp residues are partially exposed at the interface of V-H and quench the fluorophore. In the presence of antigen, the Trp residues are buried between V-H and V-L, and the quenching is eliminated. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

IR spectra computed from first-principles MD simulations exhibit no distinct differences between conformational clusters of alpha-helix or beta-sheet-like folds with different orientations of the bulky leucine side chain. All computed spectra show two prominent bands, in good agreement with the experiment, that are assigned to the stretch vibrations of the carbonyl and carboxyl group, respectively. Variations in band widths and exact maxima are likely due to small fluctuations in the backbone torsion angles. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DT Article
DE Carbon sequestration; Wetland methane emissions; Enzymic latch; Eddy
   covariance; Climate change
ID ECOSYSTEMS; FLUXES
AB This paper summarizes 19 papers published in a special issue of Ecological Engineering under the general banner of wetlands and carbon. Many of the papers were presented at a special session at EcoSummit 2016 in Montpellier, France in August-September 2016. The papers are in four general categories: estimating greenhouse gas fluxes with eddy covariance; methane and other greenhouse gas emissions from wetlands; carbon sequestration by wetlands; and organic carbon decomposition in wetlands. Overall, we found that further development and wider use of eddy covariance measuring stations could help clarify long-term annual budgets of CO2 and CH4 in wetlands and, while CH4 fluxes in some coastal wetlands such as mangroves can be negligible, some inland wetlands can be significant sources of CH4 where hydroperiods are the major determinants of the emission rates. The papers here demonstrated a variety of parameters determining dynamics of methane fluxes and carbon sequestration in different wetlands and lead us to suggest that more attention should be paid to detailed analysis of the impact of environmental and management factors on carbon budgets in wetlands. Carbon sequestration is almost always estimated by soil dating methods such as with Cs-137 and 210Pb isotopes and results continue to show order of magnitude differences among systems but sometimes among laboratories. This is due to the inexact nature of estimating soil dates over relatively short (similar to 50 year) time horizons. The idea of capping landfills, which are enormous methane sources, with wetlands which could then turn them into carbon sinks is worth investigating further but the design of these systems is still in its infancy. Organic carbon decomposition in wetlands has been investigated extensively for decades and more recently on the biogeochemical processes. 'Enzymic latches" such as phenol oxidase, which can break down phenolics and therefore speed up decomposition, may be key controllers of organic matter decomposition in waterlogged and submerged soils in wetlands. The best approach for balancing greenhouse gases and carbon sequestration remains an enigma, but the papers in this special issue take us one step closer to providing clarity.

AB Estuarine freshwater marshes can act as an important ecosystem for carbon storage and flux because of its strategic position in a watershed. We monitored CH4 and CO2 fluxes in Old Woman Creek, an estuarine wetland of Lake Erie, Ohio. The eddy covariance (EC) technique was used to measure fluxes of CH4 and CO2 continuously during the growing seasons of 2015 and 2016. Simultaneously, monthly sampling of gas exchange was conducted using non-steady state chambers in four distinct land-cover types in the wetland: open water, emergent vegetation (Typha spp.), floating vegetation (Nelumbo spp.) and mud flats. Chambers and EC measurements were combined to provide estimates of the continuous contributions of each land cover to the total methane emissions of the wetland. In addition, water and meteorological measurements were used to determine the most important environmental drivers of methane flux in the wetland. We found an average rate of emission from the Typha patch, the most abundant vegetated land cover, of 219.4 g CH4-C m(-2) y(-1), which was much higher than rates reported in similar emergent vegetation types in other wetlands. Mud flats had the highest rates of CH4 emission, followed by Nelumbo and Typha patches, and open water. Mud flats contributed 6.8% of the total CH4 emissions of the wetland despite occupying only 1.5% of the wetland area, whereas open water contributed 16.1% despite occupying 47% of the wetland area. Water temperature and wind speed were the strongest environmental drivers of CH4 flux to the atmosphere. Carbon fluxes were strongly correlated to methane fluxes. Fluctuating water levels above the wetland's surface had a weak effect on overall CH4 emissions in the wetland, with stronger effects during the night than during the day. Providing an empirical model that predicts the influence of different environmental drivers CH4 emissions in the wetland can aid in the design of estuarine wetlands that retain nutrients and reduce coastal eutrophication while minimizing greenhouse gas emissions.

AB In recent years, several studies have suggested that most lakes are net carbon sources to the atmosphere rather than carbon sinks. Quantifying and understanding the environmental drivers of carbon dioxid e(CO2) flux from lakes is important in order to have a better understanding of the current and future greenhouse-gas budget of aquatic systems and the global ecosystem as a whole. In this study, we presentobservations of CO2 fluxes in an oligotrophic lake in Northern Michigan during two full growing seasons. We used the eddy covariance technique to measure continuous fluxes of CO2 and calculate the advective fluxes between the lake and the surrounding forest. We found that, at our measurement location far from shore, to the effects of horizontal advection were significantly lower than EC-observed vertical turbulent fluxes and contributed minimally to estimate of the seasonal totals. We found that during the summers the lake was an overall net carbon source, though at rates at much lower magnitude thannear by terrestrial ecosystems. Using a hierarchical modelling approach, we determined that net carbon flux from the lake is primarily correlated with wind speed, indicating the key role of mixing in the upper water layer. Variables indicative of microbial activity and lake gas storage were more highly correlated with the positive fraction of carbon flux than with carbon uptake. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Processes affecting CO2 and CH4 emissions and their budgets have been relatively well studied in northern temperate peatlands, whereas similar studies are almost absent in southern Patagonia and the high-altitude Andean peatlands, both of which are currently under heavy anthropogenic pressure. Theobjectives of this study were to compare greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in natural and managed peatlands to examine the effect of management on GHG emissions and identify the environmental parameters affecting them. We analysed CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions related to the physical and chemical conditions of the peat: in a natural and managed transitional bog in Quebec, Canada, a natural paramo andgrazed peatland in the Colombian Andes, and a bog and a fen in Tierra del Fuego, Argentina. GHG fluxeswere measured using the dark static chamber method. Groundwater table, temperature, O-2 content, pH and redox potential were measured from observation wells, soil temperature was measured at four depths, peat samples were analysed for pH, soil organic matter and dry matter content, P, K, Ca, Mg, NH4-N, NO3-N, total N and C. In all regions, human- impacted peatlands showed significantly higher CO2-C, N2O-N and CH4-C emissions than their natural counterparts. The Canadian managed transitionalbog showed the highest average CO2-C (575 mg C m(-2) h(-1)) and N2O-N (0.08 mg N m(-2) h(-1)) emissions, whereas the Colombian pasture was the largest emitter of CH4-C (2.35 mg C m(-2) h(-1)). CO2-C emissionswere controlled by soil temperature and C content, whereas CH4-C flux was negatively correlated to dissolved oxygen content in peat water, and positively to water table level and soil log (C/NO3-N) ratio. Total Inorganic Nitrogen (TIN), C/N ratio, and soil temperature were the main factors controlling N2O emissions. Intensive peatland management alters the soil C/N balance, and increases and leads to higher variability of GHG emissions. Agricultural activities, especially crop production in peatlands, as well asintensive grazing in mountain peatland pastures, are the main factors increasing GHG emissions in the peatlands studied. Mitigation is possible via regulation of grazing intensity and replacing arable fields with grasslands. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Ecosystem services are becoming increasingly important and a reason to promote the sustainable use of natural resources. Wetlands provide many valuable ecosystem services, including carbon (C) sequestration. Wetlands are an important C sink, playing a key role in climate regulation. As such, their ability to sequester C is being considered in national GHG emissions assessments and private initiatives as a potential source of revenue to manage carbon-balanced landscapes and pay for ecosystem services. To be able to implement these initiatives widely some aspects of wetland carbon science and practice still need to be formalized and standardized. Here we synthesize the scientific basis of the biogeochemical processes that drive C sequestration in wetlands and assess the methods available for its measurement. We have reviewed data in 110 peer-reviewed studies form wetlands around the world and provide an overview of the current policies and guidelines in which C sequestration in wetlands is framed as an ecosystem management practice. The intention of this review is to provide a wide and comprehensive summary of C sequestration in wetlands, from science to practice. This analysis can help inform practitioners and land-scape managers in future considerations regarding project design and policy implementation, improve current climate mitigation schemes and payment for ecosystem services frameworks, and foster the worldwide implementation of wetland restoration, creation, and conservation projects for sustainable development and climate change mitigation and adaptation.

AB We measured soil organic carbon (C) sequestration and nutrient (nitrogen-N, phosphorus-P) burial in Czech and Midwest U.S. freshwater floodplain and depressional wetlands to evaluate how landscape position and agricultural land use intensity affects C, N, and P retention. Land use in the South Bohemia of the Czech Republic is dominated by forest and pasture, whereas in the Midwest U.S., land use is dominated by row crop agriculture. Cs-137 and Pb-210 dating of soil cores revealed comparable rates of soil accretion among wetland types, ranging from 0.5 mm/yr in a Czech floodplain wetland to 2.3 mm/yr in a U.S. depressional wetland. Carbon sequestration and N & P burial did not differ among floodplain (47 + 14 g C/m(2)/yr, 3.7 + 1 g N/m(2)/yr, 0.47 + 0.16 g P/m(2)/yr) and depressional wetlands (50 + 19 g/m(2)/yr, 3.6 + 1.3 g N/m(2)/yr, 0.51 + 0.14 g P/m(2)/yr). However, sediment deposition in Czech floodplain and depressional wetlands was only 10-50% (150-340 g/m(2)/yr) of rates measured in U.S. wetlands (650-1460 g/m(2)/yr). Our results suggest that, in agricultural landscapes, land use intensity rather than landscape position - floodplain versus depression - drives wetland C sequestration and nutrient retention through increased sediment deposition.

AB Artificial wetlands are constructed around the globe for a variety of services, including wastewater treatment and carbon storage. To become a carbon sink, a newly constructed wetland must have a fully developed vegetation, consisting of species that can produce more organic matter than is being lost through decomposition. However, the effects of environmental conditions on the overall balance between production and decomposition might be complex. In this study, two large-scale field litterbag experiments were performed in a three-year old constructed wetland in the Netherlands, to separate the effects of litter characteristics and environmental conditions on decomposition rates of aquatic pioneer vegetation. Dimension reduction by principal component analysis was used to limit the number of variables for subsequent analyses in linear models. When transplanted to one common environment, litter characteristics alone could explain 52% and 26% of the variation in decomposition after 6 and 12 months, respectively. When both litter characteristics and environmental conditions were tested simultaneously and litter was decomposed in its original environment, 37% and 23% of the variation could be explained after 6 and 12 months, respectively. Both experiments showed two phases of decomposition: the initial leaching phase with an important role for litter characteristics and microbial communities in the model, and the second, slower phase, which is predominantly determined by litter characteristics and environmental conditions such as water quality. Model results could not be extrapolated to a fully developed reference area. Optimization of conditions in order to limit decomposition rates seems difficult and therefore we suggest using management options to influence biomass production and thereby fully exploit the use of newly constructed wetlands for carbon storage.

AB The production and decomposition of litter in mangroves plays a significant role in the nutrient and organic carbon cycles. These can be highly variable both spatially and temporally as a result of numerous factors including tidal range, forest type, abundance and type of herbivorous fauna, temperature, and microbial activity. Mangroves also play an important role in blue carbon sequestration, with their status as carbon sinks crucial in mitigating against greenhouse gas-induced climate change. Blue carbon is a term used to describe the carbon captured by oceans and coastal ecosystems. We review and discuss the current available knowledge regarding sources of organic matter (OM) in mangroves as well as the roles of benthic macrofauna, water and microbial activity in the decomposition of OM in order to gain a better understanding of the decompositional processes that take place. Macrofauna break down and bury litter, thereby improving litter quality, in turn increasing decomposition rates via leaching and microbial activity. Microbial decomposition in mangroves is slow as a result of phenolic concentrations in the litter. A build-up of phenolic compounds inhibits microbial activity leading to the accumulation of OM in mangroves. Although knowledge has improved, there are still gaps in the information available and we still have an incomplete picture of the decompositional process in mangroves, and in particular the formation of blue carbon stores, necessitating further research.

AB Due to increased loss of wetland areas globally, restoration of wetlands has become common practice and is applied to increase wetland areas as well as improving ecological services of existing wetlands. Although the importance of wetlands in carbon sequestration has been recognized, the effects of restoration activities on CO2 release and uptake are still unknown. We measured net-ecosystem exchange (NEE) in two sites, a natural site and a restored site, at the New Jersey Meadowlands, an urban tidal wetland, using the eddy-covariance method from 2014 to 2016. These data were used to compare the two sites and understand the effects of restoration on NEE. A procedure was developed to partition measured fluxes between vegetation types, using footprint modeling and light response curves. Following the partitioning, we compared CO2 fluxes from invasive and native wetland vegetation communities. Separating flux data into vegetation communities and to seasonal and diurnal fluxes revealed patterns in CO2 fluxes that allowed determining the nature of each vegetation cover as a source or sink for CO2. Our results show that CO2 emissions from the restored wetland were significantly higher than the natural wetland. During restoration, the invasive wetland species Phragmites australis was replaced by the native Spartina alterniflora, which was then found to have an increased CO2 uptake during summer days, but also higher CO2 emissions during nights and winters. Therefore, the wetland restoration practice might be responsible for the increased carbon dioxide release. Additionally, allochthonous carbon input from the river to the wetland was found to be larger at the restored site. Thus, during the study, S. alterniflora that was introduced to the restored wetland site was serving as a carbon source, releasing CO2 to the atmosphere.

AB Wetlands are natural sources of methane (CH4) emissions, with the majority of those releases in tropical and subtropical regions. Land-use modifications can change a wetland's hydroperiod and flow-through conditions, among the most important factors controlling methanogenesis. The goal of this research was to determine and compare CH4 fluxes from six subtropical cypress (Taxodium) swamps in southwest Florida with different hydroperiods and noticeably different land-use conditions. Three of the swamps were at a highly protected strand of cypress swamps in Corkscrew Swamp Sanctuary and three were on a university campus, which had been exposed to historical land-use and hydrologic modifications well before the campus was constructed in the 1990s. Gas samples were taken twice daily at 10 times over a year. Fluxes from the reference sites were significantly higher than fluxes from the disturbed sites. Mean CH4 emissions (+/- standard error) were 25.9 +/- 15.6, 22 +/- 21.8 and 49.5 +/- 24.7 mg CH4-C m(-2) d(-1) for the reference bald cypress slough, pond cypress slough and cypress dome, respectively, and 4.0 +/- 3.8, - 1.4 +/- 0.8, and 0.5 +/- 0.5 mg CH4-C m(-2) d(-1) for the disturbed pond cypress slough and two cypress domes, respectively. Deeper water and higher soil temperatures at the time of sampling, by themselves, did not explain higher CH4 fluxes. More continuous surface flooding at the reference sites compared to seasonal flooding at the disturbed wetlands appear to be the main cause for the differences in methane emissions at the two sites.

TI Methane emissions from mangrove soils in hydrologically disturbed and

AB Studies have suggested that some mangrove soils might contribute to wetland methane (CH4) production and emissions, especially when the mangroves are disturbed. CH4 emissions were measured seasonally from nine locations on two mangrove creeks on Naples Bay in southwest Florida, USA. One of the tidal creeks has been impacted in the past few decades with alteration of upstream watersheds and freshwater inflows; the other creek was an un-impacted reference tidal creek. Our study sites were established along a longitudinal gradient (distance to the cree.s mouth) with different plant communities and freshwater influences, which were further evaluated by measurements during the dry and wet seasons. CH4 emission measurements were also performed during the flood and ebb tides (n = 6) to incorporate the influence of water level fluctuations on CH4 emissions. Additionally, hydroperiods and soil pore water electrical conductivity (EC) as a measure of salinity were measured along the study creeks. Our study showed very small, if not negligible, CH4 emissions from mangrove soils in this southwest Florida location at all sampling locations and sampling times. Despite our collecting over 1900 methane samples from methane emission chambers, most analyses of rates of change in the chambers showed no methane emissions. Seasonal averages ranged from 0.24 to 1.68 mg CH4-C m(-2) d(-1) (annual average of 0.32 g CH4-C m(-2) y(-1)). Ironically, the lowest methane emissions were at the end (December-January) of a typical wet season of daily rainfall and were highest in the dry season (March-April) when freshwater inputs from watersheds and precipitation were negligible. Water level fluctuations, freshwater inputs, and plant species composition did not play a significant role in CH4 emissions. There appeared to be a slight pattern of methane emissions versus air temperature but the relationship was not linear. Combining our results with carbon sequestration rates in a companion study suggested that mangroves in southwest Florida are clearly net sinks of both carbon and radiative forcing and therefore beneficial for mitigating climate warming.

AB Production of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) from peatland soil is controlled by rates of organic matter decomposition; soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition is influenced by the quality of the SOM and the soil temperature. This study determined the effect of increasing temperature and SOM quality on rates of greenhouse-gas production in lab incubations from peat soils formed under different plant functional types found in temperate rich and poor fens of southern Ontario, Canada. Peat derived from different plant functional type (sedge, shrub, and non-vascular vegetation) between the fens was composed of different amounts of SOM, lignin, and cellulose. Rates of CO2 and CH4 production from the lab slurriesin creased with increasing temperature; however, the relative increases were specific to the vegetation type overlying the soils. Anaerobic to aerobic production ratios ranged from 7% (Chamaedaphne soils) to > 30% (Sphagnum soils). Ratios of potential anaerobic production (CO2 to CH4) generally decreasedwith increasing temperature. The interaction between temperature and SOM quality was demonstrated through the range of Q(10) values (1.09-2.38 for CO2; 2.98-21.40 for CH4). These measures were correlated to lignin and cellulose content and the lingo-cellulose index. Results of this study indicate the variability of greenhouse-gas fluxes from peatland soils is influenced by the SOM quality derived from the overlying vegetation. As the climate warms soil temperatures will increase rates of decomposition, and this study will improve models of temperate peatland carbon cycling and can inform land management planning by providing options for minimizing carbon loss.

AB Climate change projections forecast an intensification of the precipitation regime for many regions of the globe, including central North America, with fewer, larger events interspersed between longer periods devoid of rain or snow. This shift has the potential to affect the carbon cycling of peatland ecosystems, including the flux of methane from the peat. We conducted a field manipulation experiment where irrigation treatments were used to simulate different seasonal rainfall regimes. The treatments were designed such that total seasonal rainfall was held constant but discrete event frequency and magnitude were altered between treatments in a poor fen in southern Ontario, Canada. The rainfall regime was controlled over three vegetation types: Sphagnum capillifolium (moss); Carex oligoperma (sedge); and Chamaedaphne calyculata (shrub). Decreasing rainfall frequency from thrice-weekly to bi-monthly [ coupled with 6X increase in event intensity] led to significantly greater CH4 flux from the moss and sedge communities in the latter third of the growing season. The shrub communities were unaffected by the changing rainfall regime. A companion lab mesocosm experiment revealed the control the fluctuating water table had on the CH4 fluxes from the vegetation community, particularly from the moss communities. Overall, there were significantly greater CH4 fluxes from all communities with increasing days since the previous rainfall event. As precipitation frequency decreases results of this study demonstrate the potential for increased CH4 flux to the atmosphere from peatland areas dominated by Sphagnum and herbaceous species. Wetland restoration and creation projects should consider these effects on peatland carbon cycling and function. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, and pollutant removal were investigated in constructed wetland (CW) mesocosms planted with the ornamental plant Zantedeschia aethiopica to treat polluted river water. We used two types of CWs, surface flow (SF) and subsurface flow (SSF), and two plant densities, high density HD (32 plants m(-2)) and low density LD (16 plants m(-2)). We also compared CH4 and N2O emissions in zones planted with macrophytes (Typha sp and Cyperus papyrus) versus zones planted with Zantedeschia aethiopica in a pilot scaled CW treating municipal wastewater. In the mesocosms, average CH4 emissions were significantly higher in SFCW (436 +/- 32 and 518 +/- 46 mg m(-2) d(-1)). than SSFCW (319 +/- 65 and 210 +/- 74 mg m(-2) d(-1)), and plant density did not affect such emissions. SSFCW showed higher ammonia and nitrate removal efficiencies than SFCW and also showed higher N2O emissions (17 +/- 3 and 23 +/- 5 mg m(-2) d(-1)). Phosphate removal efficiencies were significantly higher in SFCW than SSFCW. In the pilot scale CW, no nitrous oxide emissions were observed and average CH4 emission (11,000 +/- 930 mg m(-2) d(-2)) was higher in the zones near the outflow planted with Zantedeschia aethiopica than in the zones near the inflow planted with Typha sp (4500 +/- 800 mg m(-2) d(-2)) and Cyperus papyrus (5500 +/- 600 mg m(-2) d(-2)), although TOC was higher in the zones near the inflow. We concluded that substrate and water flow are important factors controlling greenhouse gas emissions in CW and the amount of Zantedeschia aethiopica plants did not influence the emissions. Differences in methane emissions in the zones planted with native wetland plants in comparison with zones planted with Zantedeschia aethiopica might indicate that methane production and consumption in CW is influenced differently by the ornamental plants than by native wetland plants.

AB Wetland creation is a form of ecological engineering that often relies on establishing a plant community to increase ecosystem services. However, we still lack understanding about how species composition and diversity affect certain wetland ecosystem functions associated with these ecosystem services. Our objective was to investigate the link between plant community (diversity and composition) and plant carbon storage, root surface area and methane (CH4) emission. We hypothesized that more diverse mixtures would 1) store more carbon in above and belowground biomass and 2) emit less CH4 due to increased root surface area and aeration. Three plant groups that represented different growth forms (i.e., "functional groups": ferns, reeds and tussocks) were planted in mesocosms to represent four levels of functional diversity and every combination of functional groups at each diversity level. Unplanted mesocosms served as the zero diversity treatment. At peak biomass in 2014 and 2015, we harvested aboveground biomass and took soil cores from each mesocosm at 0-10 cm to determine the root biomass and surface area. Methane fluxes were measured in situ using a closed chamber system and a Picarro G2301 CRDS analyzer. Fluxes did not vary by functional group richness level or composition. Presence of the reed and tussock functional groups decreased fluxes; however, root surface area was not correlated with CH4 emission. Plant carbon storage was greater in all treatments containing tussocks (expect for the reed tussock mixture) compared with ferns grown alone. Functional group richness did not have a significant effect on plant carbon storage, however there was a positive trend. Root surface area increased 87% from the first to second year; however, there were no differences among functional group richness levels or mixtures. Our results indicate that planting reed and tussock functional groups in dense clumps during restoration could maintain a high level of carbon storage and relatively low CH4 emissions.

AB Earth System Models predict climate extremes that will impact regional and global hydrology. Aquatic-terrestrial transition zones like wetlands are subjected to the immediate consequence of climate change with shifts in the magnitude and dynamics of hydrologic flow. Such fluctuating hydrology can alter the nature and rate of biogeochemical transformations and significantly impact the carbon balance of the ecosystem. We tested the impacts of fluctuating hydrology and, specifically, the role of antecedent moisture conditions in determining the dominant carbon loss mechanisms in soils sampled from a tidal freshwater wetland system in the lower Columbia River, WA, USA. Our objective was to understand shifts in biogeochemical processes in response to changing soil moisture, based on soil respiration and methane production rates, and to elucidate such responses based on the observed electron acceptor and metabolite profiles under laboratory conditions. Metabolomics and biogeochemical process rates provided evidence that soil redox was the principal factor driving metabolic function. Fluctuating redox conditions altered terminal electron acceptor and donor availability and recovery strengths of their concentrations in soil such that a disproportionate release of carbon dioxide stemmed from alternative anaerobic degradation processes like sulfate and iron reduction compared to carbon loss due to methanogenesis. Our results show that extended and short-term saturation created conditions conducive to increasing metabolite availability for anaerobic decomposition processes, with a significant lag in methanogenesis. In contrast, extended drying caused a cellular-level stress response and rapid recycling of alternate electron acceptors. (C) 2017 Battelle Memorial Institute. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB We evaluated the ability of freshwater riparian wetlands along a gradient of ecological condition to act as sinks for carbon and sediment. We compared rates of carbon accretion and soil accretion across 20 wetlands in the Lake Erie Drift Plain and the Ridge and Valley ecoregions. Soil cores were collected and analyzed using Cs-137 dating to quantify long-term (similar to 50 year) rates of sediment and carbon accumulation. Data on hydrology and floristic quality were used to help explain variability in rates. Sites were classified as being in low, moderate, or high ecological condition based on a rapid assessment method, which was verified by their floristic quality. Wetlands of low ecological condition (more human disturbance) had higher mean soil accretion and carbon accretion rates. Soil accretion averaged 0.24 +/- 0.17 cm yr(-1) and 0.14 +/- 0.04 cm yr(-1) in low condition sites and high condition sites, respectively. Carbon accretion averaged 88 +/- 50 gC m(-2) yr(-1) in low condition and 65 +/- 27 gC m(-2) yr(-1) in high condition sites. Low condition sites had lower mean soil carbon concentrations in the upper 10 cm of the soil profile, suggesting that the higher carbon burial in these sites was related to al-lochthonous carbon inputs in incoming sediment, rather than autochthonous carbon inputs. There were also striking rate differences between ecoregions. Erie Drift Plain wetlands had significantly higher mean soil accretion rates, compared to Ridge and Valley wetlands. These data indicate that freshwater wetlands play a role in regulating climate by acting as carbon sinks and that anthropogenic disturbance can impact rates of carbon burial.

AB Given the bioremediation potential of peat, natural capping of landfills in wetlands with a "peat cap" could provide a sustainable addition to regular capping methods using basal liners with limited life-spans and sand. It is unknown, however, which initial conditions optimise growth of this "peat cap" on top of as and layer. Here, we tested the combined effects of topsoil addition (clay or organic soil) and vegetation type (Typha latifolia, T. angustifolia, Stratiotes aloides and submerged spp.) on net ecosystem C exchange and water quality in 18 sandy basins situated in a constructed wetland on top of a landfill. Although the highest net C sequestration rates occurred in Typha stands on sand, due to lower decomposition-related C losses as compared to clay and organic topsoils, vegetation development was slow and its cover was very low (15%) compared to clay (40%) and organic topsoils (70%). As this strongly impeded the build-up of a uniform peat layer, we conclude that, within a restricted time frame, the application of nutrient-richtop soils is still necessary for sufficient biomass production to accumulate organic material. By recycling local soils, the accompanying initial C loss becomes negligible on a landscape scale. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Northern peatlands store 455 Pg of carbon-a third of the entire global carbon store. Carbon accumulates because phenolic inhibitors slow the rate of decomposition to below that of photosynthetic production. The disproportionate importance of phenolics in peatlands is related to the unique properties of waterlogged peat soils suppressing the activity of phenol oxidase; one of the few enzymes capable of breaking these inhibitors down (a role often referred to as the "enzymic latch"). This permits accumulation of phenolic compounds that are potent inhibitors of hydrolase enzymes-major agents in the breakdown of organic matter. In our study we investigate the importance of the molecular weight of phenolics on levels of inhibition of microbial decomposition in peat. We found the higher the molecular weight, of a phenolic compound, the greater its inhibitory effect on the breakdown of organic matter. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Root exudates released by vascular plants contain significant amounts of photosynthetically-derived low molecular weight carbon compounds and gases, such as oxygen. These compounds are reported to have a priming effect on the activity of soil microbes which, in turn, release extracellular soil enzymes. Rates of root exudation are known to correlate positively with photosynthesis rates. As such, we hypothesized that phenol oxidase activity in the rhizosphere of peatland plants could be manipulated by varying the intensity of light to which above ground biomass is exposed, in line with recent solar radiation management proposals of geoengineers. Since phenol oxidase plays a pivotal role in regulating biodegradation in peat soils, through a mechanism widely known as the 'enzymic latch', this approach was thought to have potential as an ecoengineering strategy designed to enhance carbon sequestration in these environments. Our experiment however, found little relationship between phenol oxidase activity and light intensity level for any of the plants analysed, although significant differences in enzyme activity were observed between plant species. It is argued therefore, that encouraging the growth of particular plant species may be more effective at enhancing carbon sequestration in peatlands than manipulating ambient light levels.

Rather high values of the conductivity (10(-4)-10(-3) S cm(-1)) have been reached at low dopant concentrations (up to 1 mol l(-1)). The influence of the nature of both polymeric matrix and dopant as well as dopant concentration on the conductivity values was discussed. It was established that the dependence of conductivity on the nature of dopant, but not the polymeric matrix, was more pronounced. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We perform a theoretical study on a set of carbon nanorings (CycloParaPhenylenes or CPP) envisioned as molecular templates for the selective synthesis of carbon nanotubes. The shape of these precursors, originating from bending n phenylene units in para position until forming the corresponding nanoring [n] CPP, may drive the growth of armchair single-walled nanotubes. This kinetic and thermodynamic study covers a set of molecules with different diameters, analyzing the exothermicity and the reaction path of a CPP-based radicaloid mechanism. The methodology employed is based on validated density functionals for mechanistic studies, shedding light on the viability of this synthetic pathway. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: We aimed to document the experience of buying abortion pills from online vendors that do not require a prescription and to evaluate the active ingredient content of the pills received.
   Study design: We searched the internet to identify a convenience sample of websites that sold mifepristone and misoprostol to purchasers in the United States and attempted to order these products. We documented price, shipping time and other aspects of ordering. We sent the samples received to a testing laboratory that measured the amount of active ingredient in individual tablets.
   Results: We identified 18 websites and ordered 22 products: 20 mifepristone misoprostol combination products and 2 that contained only misoprostol. We received 18 combination products and the 2 misoprostol products from 16 different sites. No site required a prescription or any relevant medical information. The time between order and receipt of the 20 products ranged from 3 to 21 business days (median 9.5 days). The price for the 18 combination products ranged from $110 to $360, including shipping and fees; the products without mifepristone cost less. Chemical assays found that the 18 tablets labeled 200 mg mifepristone contained between 184.3 mg and 204.1 mg mifepristone, while the 20 tablets labeled 200 mcg misoprostol contained between 34.1 mcg and 201.4 mcg of the active ingredient.
   Conclusions: Obtaining abortion medications from online pharmaceutical websites is feasible in the United States. The mifepristone tablets received contained within 8% of the labeled amount of active agent. The misoprostol tablets all contained that compound but usually less than labeled. (C) 2017 The Authors.

AB Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a highly virulent bacterium that causes tuberculosis. It infects about one third of the world's population. Type I interferons (IFNs) play a detrimental role in host defense against M. tuberculosis infection. Proteins secreted by M. tuberculosis through ESX-1 secretion system contribute to type I IFNs production. However, the precise mechanism by which 6-kDa early secretory antigen target (ESAT6), one of ESX-1-mediated secretory proteins, induces type I IFNs production in host cells is currently unclear. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to determine the underlying molecular mechanism regulating ESAT6-mediated gene expression of IFN-beta in macrophages. Recombinant ESAT6 produced from E. coli expression system induced IFN-beta gene expression in various types of macrophages such as mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), peritoneal macrophages, and MH-S cells (murine alveolar macrophage cell line). Deficiency of TLR4- and TRIF absolutely abrogated ESAT6-induced IFN-beta gene expression. TLR2 and MyD88 were partially involved in IFN-beta gene expression in response to low dose of ESAT6. Another recombinant ESAT6 produced from baculovirus system also upregulated IFN-beta gene expression via TLR4-dependent pathway. Polymyxin B (PMB) treatment impaired LPS-induced IFN-beta expression. However, IFN-beta expression induced by ESAT6 was not influenced by PMB. This suggests that ESAT6-mediated IFN-beta expression is not due to LPS contamination. Treatment with ESAT6 resulted in activation of TBK1 and IRF3 in macrophages. Such activation was abolished in TLR4- and TRIF-deficient cells. Moreover, inhibition of IRF3 and TBK1 suppressed IFN-beta gene expression in response to ESAT6. Our results suggest that ESAT6 might contribute to virulence of M. tuberculosis by regulating type I IFNs production through TLR4-TRIF signaling pathway.

AB Toll-like receptors (TLRs) recognize the pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and induce host-protective immune response. The role of the profilin-recognizing TLR11/TLR12 in Leishmania infection is unknown. Herein, we report that TLR11/TLR12 expression increases in virulent L. major-infected macrophages but is prevented by miltefosine, an anti-leishmanial drug. While lipohosphoglycan (LPG) increases, LPG or TLR2 blockade prevents, the heightened TLR11/TLR12 expression. LPG-TLR2 interaction triggers MyD88- and TIRAP-mediated signaling enhancing ERK-1/2 activation and increased production of IL-10 that promotes TLR11/TLR12 expression. Profilin expression was higher in the virulent L. major and L donovani parasites than that observed in the avirulent parasites. TLR11 or TLR12 silencing reduces parasite burden and increases IFN-gamma, but reduces IL-4, production indicating that TLR11 and TLR12 play a pro-leishmanial role.

AB Random mutations leading to loss of cell cycle control is not a rare occurrence in an organism but the mutated cells are recognized and eliminated preventing the development of a tumor. These potentially tumorigenic cells release damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), which are recognized by toll-like receptors (TLRs) on macrophages and dendritic cells. The initial TLR-DAMP interactions lead to different responses such as altered antigen presentation and cytokine release that directly affect T cell activation and removal of the tumorigenic cells. The indirect effects of TLR-DAMP interaction include chemokine-directed altered T cell trafficking, angiogenesis for both T cell infiltration and tumor cell metastasis, and alteration of intra-tumoral milieu contributing to the development of tumor cells heterogeneity. Thus, the initial TLR-DAMP interaction has a set of local effects that modulate tumor cell growth and heterogeneity and a disseminating set of central effects that dynamically affect T cell trafficking and functions. Herein, we argue that the DAMP-TLR-cytokine axis in the tumor microenvironment serves as the mainstay that orchestrates and regulates the pro- and anti-tumor elements which dynamically interact between themselves eventuating in tumor regression or growth. The knowledge of this TLR-based immuno-surveillance framework is a key to developing a novel immunotherapy against cancer.

AB The obstruction of fish migratory routes by hydroelectric facilities is worldwide one of the major threats to freshwater fishes. During downstream migration, fish may be injured or killed on the trash-racks or in the hydropower turbines. Fish-friendly trash-racks that combine both ecological and technical requirements are a solution to mitigate fish mortality at a low operational cost. This study presents results from an experimental investigation of head-losses and the hydrodynamic performance of six angled trash-rack types with 15 mm bar spacing, varying bar-setup (vertical-streamwise, vertical-angled and horizontal bars) and bar profiles (rectangular and drop shape) under steady flow conditions. The trash-racks were positioned at 30 degrees to the wall of the flume and combined with a bypass at their downstream end. The impact of the different trash-rack types on the upstream flow field was characterized using Image based Volumetric 3-component Velocimetry (V3V) and at the bypass-entrance using an Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter (ADV). The results show that trash-racks with vertical-streamwise and horizontal oriented bars with drop-shape profiles have similar head-losses (13% difference), while trash-racks with vertical-angled bars provide 3-8 times larger head-losses compared to the remaining configurations. The velocity measurements showed that the highest flow velocities occurred for configurations with vertical-angled bars (0.67 m s(-1) and 0.81 m s(-1) on average, respectively). Turbulence related parameters (e.g. Reynolds shear stresses and Turbulent kinetic energy) were also investigated to evaluate the performance of the alternative trash-racks from both, engineering and ecological perspectives.

AB Elaeagnus angustifolia L. has considerable ecological value and plays an important role in windbreak and sand fixation, soil and water conservation, vegetation restoration and afforestation in Asia. Understanding the potential distribution and the limiting climatic factors is the first step for sustainable use of this species at regional scale. Here, we simulated the potential distribution of E. angustifolia and evaluated its limiting climatic factors using a maximum entropy model (MaxEnt) and geographical information system (GIS) in China, based on 190 occurrence grid cells and 13 climatic variables in China. The results show that: (1) annual range of temperature (ART), annual mean temperature (AMT), humidity index (HI), and coldness index (CI) are the dominant climatic factors limiting its potential distribution range; (2) low temperature is an important climatic factor that limits both southern and northern distribution boundaries, and high rainfall is another climatically limiting factor for the southern boundary, and (3) the potential distribution areas are mainly located in the warm temperate and middle temperate zone with cold and dry winters, and in the arid and semi-arid regions of China between 30 degrees N and 50 degrees N. The simulating results can improve our understanding of the geographical and ecological characteristics of E. angustifolia, and provide references for the introduction of this species for control and restoration of degraded land in China.

AB Plant species diversity could enhance nitrogen and phosphorus removal efficiencies in constructed wetlands (CWs). However, the effects of plant diversity on other pollutants removal efficiencies in CWs are still unknown. In this study, we conducted a microcosm experiment simulating floating CWs using four common early spring species to set up four species richness (1, 2, 3, and 4) and fifteen species compositions to explore the effects of plant diversity on the removal efficiencies of calcium (Ca), potassium (K), and magnesium (Mg) and their pools in plants. Results showed that (1) plant species richness had no effect on Ca, K, and Mg removal efficiencies; however, it increased plant K and Mg pools; (2) among the four monocultures, the Ca removal efficiency and plant Ca pool of the Rumex japonicus monoculture was the highest; the K removal efficiencies and plant K pools of Oenanthe javanica or R. japonicus monoculture were significantly higher than those of other two species monocultures; (3) the presence of R. japonicas increased the Ca removal efficiency and belowground plant Ca pool; however, the presence of Phalaris arundinacea decreased the Ca removal efficiency and belowground plant Ca pool; (4) the presence of O. javanica increased the K removal efficiency and plant (aboveground and belowground) K pool; however, the presence of P. arundinacea decreased the K removal efficiency and belowground plant K pool; and (5) no difference in Mg removal efficiency was found among species compositions. Assembling proper plant species composition in CWs might be more important than simply increasing species richness for increasing Ca and K removal efficiencies.

AB A free water-surface constructed wetland (F4-unit) was created in a Mediterranean protected site to treat eutrophic inflows to the Albufera de Valencia lagoon, and enhance biodiversity. In 2013, the F4-unit was divided into three subunits and planted with different compositions of emergent macrophytes (Phragmites australis, Iris pseudacorus, and a mixture of several macrophytes: F4-Reed, F4-Iris and F4-Mixed subunits). Two nine-month periods were monitored after planting, and water quality variables were measured in the inflows and outflows. Waterfowl occupation and plankton biomass were analyzed to evaluate their role in eutrophication reversion. The low removal efficiencies related to scarce vegetation development and wind disturbance in the first period, significantly improved in the second, particularly in the F4-Reed subunit (total cumulative mass removals of 438, 363 and 372 kg of nitrogen, 57, 30 and 48 kg of phosphorus and 7109, 573 and 2315 kg of suspended solids in the Reed, Iris and Mixed F4 subunits). This was due to the high continuous coverage (around 70%) achieved by reeds, but also by other species that spontaneously germinated from the seed bank (cattails, Paspalum sp). The constructed wetland significantly reduced the exported microalgal biomass, stimulated the potential mixotrophic phytoplankton groups, such as Euglenophyceae, and produced large quantities of zooplankton, particularly ostracods and cladocerans, which efficiently grazed on microalgae. The total cumulative mass removal of chlorophyll for the second period of operation represented 2.6 times more removal than in the first period. Almost 50% of the waterfowl species visiting the zone were of special conservation concern. Differences in vegetation structure between subunits drove a concrete selection of stopover sites for migratory, endangered shorebirds that had low impact on solid resuspension. Endangered, large and medium-sized waterfowl (higher impact on resuspension while foraging), more abundant in the post-breeding period, showed no preferences between subunits. This study supports the idea of recommending the configuration of these kinds of systems for managing eutrophicated waters in protected sites and enhancing waterfowl species of conservation concern.

AB The main aim of our study was to construct a two-stage vertical flow constructed wetland (VFCW) system to treat single household raw sewage water in India under tropical climate. For selecting the plant species different sets of lab experiments were carried out. Two different plant species (Typha angustata and Canna indica) were considered for their nutrient removal efficiency and biochemical methane potential (BMP) efficiency. Drum experiments were conducted to select the most suitable species for the constructed wetland. Batch assays were conducted in 100 ml bottles in order to determine BMP of plant biomass. The overall nutrient removal efficiency was the same in case of both the plant species that were tested. Typha angustata had been selected for planting in the single household wetland system as it is found in the natural wetlands of Goa and they have higher BMP than other species. The nutrient removal of pilot scale VFCW was monitored at two hydraulic loadings at 0.150 m/.day and at 0.225 m/.day. The removal of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD), Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN), Ammoniacal Nitrogen (NH3-N), Total Phosphorous (TP), Total Dissolved Solid (TDS) and Total Volatile Solids (TVS) at 1st stage was 64%, 65%, 15%, 21%, 34% and 54% and for the 2nd stage reactor it is 90%, 88%, 50%, 52%, 58% and 71% respectively on an average. After changing HLR (hydraulic loading rate) to 0.225 m/.day the removal of COD, BOD, TDS, TVS, TKN and NH3-N at 1st stage was 61%, 62%, 33%, 40%, 35% and 58% and for the 2nd stage reactor it is 90%, 84%, 61%, 64%, 47% and 82% respectively on an average. As the loading rate increases there is no change in the treatment efficiency of TKN and NH3-N treatment efficiency increases. However marginal decrease in the treatment efficiency of COD and BOD of the system was observed. The overall footprint of the system got reduced from 1.5m(2) per person to 0.79m(2) per person under Goan climatic conditions.

AB Background: The balance of several cytokines likely influences the resolution of glomerulonephritis. Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1(MCP-1) is a chemokine that promotes renal inflammation whereas epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulates protective responses. Previously, high urine MCP-1(MCP-1) and low urine EGF (EGF) levels were found to be associated with tubulointerstitial fibrosis, but there is limited information on the value of these mediators as predictors of therapeutic responses or long term outcome in primary glomerulonephritis.
   Objectives: To determine the performance of urine EGF, MCP-1 or their ratio at baseline as biomarkers to predict complete remission, and the relationship of these mediators with subsequent renal function 24 months later in primary glomerulonephritis.
   Methods: This is a prospective study of patients with biopsy-proven primary glomerulonephritis. Baseline urine samples were collected at biopsy before therapy. MCP-1 and EGF were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and expressed as a ratio to urine creatinine (ng/mgCr) or as EGF/MCP-1 ratio (ng/ng). Proteinuria and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGRF) were monitored after therapy. Complete remission (CR) was defined as proteinuria <= 0.3 g/gCr.
   Results: Median follow-up was 20 months. Of all patients (n = 74), 38 patients (51.4%) subsequently achieved CR. Baseline urine EGF and EGF/MCP-1 levels were significantly higher in CR compared to Not CR. By contrast, MCP-1 was not different. High EGF (EGF > 75 ng/mgCr) was a significant predictor (OR 2.28) for CR by multivariate analysis after adjusting for proteinuria, blood pressure, baseline eGFR. In patients who completed 24 months follow-up (n = 43), baseline EGF correlated inversely with proteinuria and positively with eGFR at 24 months.
   Conclusion: High urine EGF level is a promising biomarker of CR. Baseline EGF levels correlated with kidney function at 2 years. EGF/MCP-1 was not superior to EGF alone. Further studies are necessary to determine the role of urine EGF as a guide to therapy in primary GN.

AB The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has been recognized as a highly pathogenic virus to humans that infects the respiratory tract and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Studies in animal models suggest that MERS-CoV infection induces a strong inflammatory response, which may be related to the severity of disease. Data showing the cytokine profiles in humans during the acute phase of MERS-CoV infection are limited. In this study, we have analyzed the profile of cytokine responses in plasma samples from patients with confirmed MERS-CoV infections (n = 7) compared to healthy controls (n = 13). The cytokine profiles, including T helper (Th) 1, Th2 and Th17 responses, were analyzed using cytometric bead array (CBA). A prominent pro-inflammatory Th1 and Th17 response was clearly seen in patients with MERS-CoV infection, with markedly increased concentrations of IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-15 and IL-17 compared to controls. IL-12 expression levels showed no difference between patients with MERS-CoV infection and the healthy controls despite the significantly increased levels of IFN-alpha 2 and IFN-gamma (P < .01). No changes were observed in the levels of IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and TGF-alpha (P > .05). Our results demonstrate a marked pro-inflammatory cytokine response during the acute phase of MERS-CoV infection in humans.

AB Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) is the causative pathogen of Johne's disease in ruminants, characterized by chronic granulomatous enteritis; it also has zoonotic potential and is associated with Crohn's disease in humans. A better understanding of the mycobacterial antigens and their roles in the host immune response may facilitate the rational design of control strategies, including the development of effective vaccines and diagnostic tools. However, the functional roles of a large proportion of MAP antigens involved in modulating the host immune response remain unknown. In this study, an immunological role of MAP malate dehydrogenase (MDH, MAP2541c), an antigen that is upregulated in stress culture conditions, such as nutrient starvation and hypoxia, in polarizing naive CD4(+)/CD8(+) T cells toward Th1-biased T-cell immunity via the activation of dendritic cells (DCs) was identified. DCs treated with MAP MDH displayed characteristics of the activated and mature immune status, with augmented expression of cell surface molecules and pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, and IL-12p70, but not IL-10, along with a dose-dependent decrease in the antigen uptake capacity. A mechanistic investigation revealed that the observed DC maturation is mediated by the activation of JNK, ERK, and p38 MAP kinases, and the NF-kappa B signaling pathway. Notably, DCs activated by MAP MDH treatment promoted naive CD4(+)/CD8(+) T cell proliferation; in particular, they effectively polarized naive CD4(+) T cells to secrete IFN-gamma and IL-2 and activate T-bet, but, unlike the LPS control, did not influence IL-5 and GATA-3. These results indicated that MAP MDH has the potential to induce the Th1 cell response via DC activation. Collectively, our data demonstrated that MAP MDH is a novel immunostimulatory antigen that drives Th1-biased T cell polarization via interactions with DCs, suggesting that MDP MDH has the potential to be an effective MAP vaccine antigen target and diagnostic marker.

AB Objective: To investigate the expression levels of fractalkine (FKN) mRNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and FKN protein in serum of patients with lupus nephritis (LN) from China, and to evaluate the associations between the expression of FKN and systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity index 2000 (SLEDAI-2 K), anti-double-stranded DNA and complement proteins in LN patients.
   Methods: Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were used to detect the expression levels of FKN mRNA in PBMCs and FKN protein in serum separately from 105 patients with LN and 52 healthy controls.
   Results: Serum level and mRNA level of FKN were significantly increased in LN patients when compared to controls (P < 0.001). Higher FKN levels were found in active LN patients and LN patients with renal damage when compared with inactive LN patients and IN patients without renal damage (P < 0.001). Higher serum FKN levels were detected in inactive LN patients in comparison with healthy controls (Z = -7.165, P < 0.001). The FKN expression levels were positively correlated with SLEDAI-2 K, and was associated with the presence of autoantibodies and negatively correlated with complement proteins C3 and C4 in LN patients.
   Conclusions: The results suggest that upregulation of FKN is associated with the pathogenesis and activity of LN in Chinese patients.

AB Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1), a double-stranded RNA-editing enzyme that converts adenosine (A) to inosine (I), has been identified as a modulator of immune responses. However, the role of ADAR1 in small intestinal homeostasis during sepsis remains unclear. In this study, we examined the role of ADAR1 on intestinal inflammation in a murine model of sepsis. We found that ADAR1 was highly expressed in "septic" macrophages and small intestinal tissue of septic mice. Deletion of ADAR1 in "septic" macrophages led to rapid apoptosis. In addition, suppression of ADAR1 in "septic" macrophages significantly enhanced inflammation, while over-expression of ADAR1 significantly suppressed the level of inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, suppression of ADAR1 in septic mice significantly enhanced inflammation and intestinal damage, while enhanced ADAR1 expression resulted in reduced damage and inflammation. Finally, over-expression of ADAR1 improved survival of septic mice. In conclusion, we have identified a novel ADAR1 protective effect for maintaining intestinal homeostasis. Our findings may provide a new targeted therapy for sepsis treatment.

AB Human type I interferons are a family of pleiotropic cytokines with antiviral, anti-proliferative and immunomodulatory activities. They signal through the same cell surface receptors IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 yet evoking markedly different physiological effects. One differentiating factor of interferon-beta (IFN-beta) from other type I interferons is the presence of the Asn-Gly-Arg (NGR) sequence motif, which, upon deamidation, converts to Asp-Gly-Arg (DGR) and iso-Asp-Gly-Arg (iso-DGR) motifs. In other proteins, the NGR and iso-DGR motifs are reported as CD13- and alpha v beta 3, alpha v beta 5, alpha v beta 6, alpha v beta 8 and alpha 5 beta 1 integrin-binding motifs, respectively. The scope of this study was to perform exploratory surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments to assess the binding properties of a deamidated IFN-beta variant to integrin. For this purpose, integrin alpha v beta 3 was selected as a reference model within the iso-DGR- integrin binding members. The obtained results show that deamidated IFN-beta binds integrin alpha v beta 3 with nanomolar affinity and that the response was dependent on the deamidation extent. Based on these results, it can be expected that deamidated IFN-beta also binds to other integrin family members that are able to bind to the iso-DGR binding motif. The novel binding properties could help elucidate specific IFN-beta attributes that under physiological conditions may be modulated by the deamidation.

AB Objectives: Chemerin is an adipokine with established roles in inflammation, adipogenesis and the regulation of glucose and lipid homeostasis. Extracellular proteolytic processing of chemerin generates a spectrum of isoforms that differ significantly with respect to the ability to activate the cognate receptors chemokine-like receptor 1 (CMKLR1) and G-protein-coupled receptor 1 (GPR1). Increased total serum chemerin has been widely reported in obese humans as well as in preclinical rodent models of adiposity. However, very little information is available regarding the correspondence, if any, of changes in total serum chemerin protein with chemerin bioactivity.
   Methods: Total serum chemerin and ex vivo CMKLR1 and GPR1 activation was compared using two widely used murine obesity models: high fat diet feeding (HFD) and leptin deficiency (ob/ob).
   Results: Total serum chemerin levels and ex vivo CMKLR1 and GPR1 activation were significantly induced in HFD. The bioactivity ratio (bioactive chemerin/total chemerin) was also increased when measured with CMKLR1, but not GPR1. In contrast, while ob/ob mice exhibited increased total serum chemerin protein, ex vivo receptor activation was observed with GPR1, but not CMKLR1. There was no change in bioactivity ratio for either receptor. Of note, GPR1 but not CMKLR1 bioactivity positively correlated with adipose tissue inflammation.
   Conclusions: While increased total serum chemerin is a consistent finding among rodent obesity models, this may not accurately reflect changes in chemerin bioactivity which is the major determinant of biological effects.

AB Purpose: Obesity results in decreased lung function and increased inflammation. Moderate aerobic exercise (AE) reduced lung inflammation and remodeling in a variety of respiratory disease models. Therefore, this study investigated whether AE can attenuate a diet-induced obesity respiratory phenotype; including airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), remodeling and inflammation.& para;& para;Methods: Sixty C57B1/6 male mice were distributed into four groups: control lean (CL), exercise lean (EL), obese (O) and obese exercise (OE) groups (2 sets of 7 and 8 mice per group; n = 15). A classical model of diet-induced obesity (DIO) over 12 weeks was used. AE was performed 60 min/day, 5 days/week for 5 weeks. Airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), lung inflammation and remodeling, adipokines and cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was determined.& para;& para;Results: A high fat diet over 18 weeks significantly increased body weight (p < .0001). Five weeks of AE significantly reduced both AHR and pulmonary inflammation. AHR in obese mice that exercised was reduced at the basal level (p < .05), vehicle (PBS) (p < .05), 6.25 MCh mg/mL (p < .05), 12.5 MCh mg/mL (p < .01), 25 MCh mg/mL (p < .01) and 50 MCh mg/mL (p < .05). Collagen (p < .001) and elastic (p < .001) fiber deposition in airway wall and also smooth muscle thickness (p < .001) were reduced. The number of neutrophils (p < .001), macrophages (p < .001) and lymphocytes (p < .01) were reduced in the peribronchial space as well as in the BAL: lymphocytes (p < .01), macrophages (p < .01), neutrophils (p < .001). AE reduced obesity markers leptin (p < .001), IGF-1 (p < .01) and VEGF (p < .001), while increased adiponectin (p < .01) in BAL. AE also reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines in the SAL: IL-1 beta (p < .001), IL-12p40 (p < .001), IL-13 (p < .01), IL-17 (p < .001, IL-23 (p < .05) and TNF-alpha (p < .05), and increased antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10 (p < .05).& para;& para;Conclusions: Aerobic exercise reduces high fat diet-induced obese lung phenotype (AHR, pulmonary remodeling and inflammation), involving anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and adiponectin.

AB M. tuberculosis F15/LAM4/KZN has been associated with high transmission rates of drug resistant tuberculosis in the KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa. The current study elucidated the cytokine/chemokine responses induced by representatives of the F15/LAM4/KZN and other dominant strain families in pulmonary epithelial cells. Multiplex cytokine analyses were performed at 24, 48 and 72 h post infection of the A549 pulmonary epithelial cell line with the F15/LAM4/KZN, F28, F11, Beijing, Unique and H37Rv strains at an MOI of similar to 10:1. Twenty-three anti- and pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines were detected at all-time intervals. Significantly high concentrations of IL-6, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha and G-CSF at 48 h, and IL-8, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, G-CSF and GM-CSF at 72 h, were induced by the F28 and F15/LAM4/KZN strains, respectively. Lower levels of cytokines/chemokines were induced by either the Beijing or Unique strains at all three time intervals. All strains induced up-regulation of pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) (TLR3 and TLR5) while only the F15/LAM4/KZN, F11 and F28 strains induced significant differential expression of TLR2 compared to the Beijing, Unique and H37Rv strains. The low induction of cytokines in epithelial cells by the Beijing strain correlates with its previously reported hypervirulent properties. High concentrations of cytokines and chemokines required for early protection against M. tuberculosis infections induced by the F15/LAM4/KZN and F28 strains suggests a lower virulence of these genotypes compared to the Beijing strain. These findings demonstrate the high diversity in host cytokine/chemokine response to early infection of pulmonary epithelial cells by different strains of M. tuberculosis.

AB Toll-like receptors (TLRs), the innate immune receptors, act as sentinels bridging both innate and adaptive arms of immunity. In the present study, we estimated TLR-induced secretion of IL-27, IL-12, IL-23, IL-8, IP-10, IL-17, IL-6 and TNF-alpha (by ELISA) and expression of Human Leukocyte Antigen- (Human Leukocyte Antigen - antigen D Related (HLA-DR), CD69, CD80 (also known as B7-1) (by flowcytometry) and Activating Transcription Factor 3(ATF3) (by qRT-PCR) in whole blood cultures of control and type-2 diabetic (both newly diagnosed/NDD and known/KDM) subjects. TLR-induced secretion of IL-27 was significantly reduced in the NDD group compared to the control (Normal Glucose Tolerance (NGT)) and KDM groups. On the other hand, the expression of CD80 was significantly upregulated in both the monocytes and B cells in KDM group. This was associated with increased T cell activation (CD3 + CD69 + HLA-DR+) with increased IL-17 and reduced TNF-alpha secretion in this group. Impaired TLR-induced IL-27 secretion and augmented expression of antigen presentation molecules result in chronic T cell activation which may fuel T cell-mediated inflammation in type-2 diabetes.

AB Depression and anxiety, the most important psychological disorders in cancer patients, have now been considered as psychoneuroimmunological disorders, in which peripheral immune activation, through the release of proinflammatory cytokines, is implicated in the variety of behavioral, neuroendocrine and neurochemical alterations associated with these disorders. Along with the tumor itself, cancer treatment can also contribute to exacerbate the production of proinflammatory cytokines. This study aimed to investigate whether proinflammatory cytokine levels are related to depression and anxiety in CRC patients in different stages of the antitumor therapy We evaluated 60 patients in three stages of antitumor therapy (Pre-chemotherapy, Under chemotherapy and Post-chemotherapy, n = 20 in each group) and 20 healthy volunteers by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Serum levels of cytokines were measured by CBA. Depression and/or anxiety were found at clinically relevant levels in CRC patients during all antitumor therapy. Patients in pre-chemotherapy group exhibited the highest concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the lowest levels of IL-10. In latter stages of treatment, cytokines reached levels similar to the control group. Correlation analysis between HADS score and cytokine serum levels revealed positive associations of anxiety and/or depression with IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha, and a negative correlation with IL-10, suggesting that cytokines are involved in the pathophysiology of these psychological disorders in CRC patients. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in these psychological disorders will allow the design of new therapeutic strategies to assist in alleviating such symptoms in cancer patients.

AB Functional testing protocols are thought to be the gold standard for the exploration of the immune system. However, in terms of routine analysis, they present numerous drawbacks and consequently their use is mainly limited to research applications. In the clinical context of septic shock, characterized by marked lymphocyte alterations, a new approach for lymphocyte intracellular cytokine measurement in whole blood upon was evaluated in a proof-of-concept study. Following lymphocyte activation, simultaneous intracellular labeling of Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and Interleukin-2 (IL-2) was performed in CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells (identified by surface marking). The analysis was carried out by flow cytometry (6 colors). Results obtained in septic patients (n = 22) were compared to those of healthy volunteers (n = 8). independently of lymphopenia, there were significant differences between groups. In particular there was significant decrease in the production of IL-2 and TNF-alpha in septic patients, while the production of IFN-gamma was not significantly altered. Polyfunctional results showed that patients presented with increased percentages of triple negative lymphocytes. In contrast, volunteers had higher proportions of triple positive cells. The approach could be performed in a robust and consistent way, taking 4.5 h to complete. Moreover, clear differences could be observed between clinical groups with this modified method. These characteristics illustrate the potential of this novel whole blood protocol for clinical applications. However, further research is required to determine the applicability compared to alternative test and to evaluate clinical performances in larger cohorts of patients.

AB Interleukin-33 (IL-33) is one of the last discovered members of the human IL-1 family. It is involved in the pathogenesis of many inflammatory diseases. This study investigates the relationship between IL33 gene variants and serum protein levels with the development of childhood asthma. We analyzed in this case-control study the distribution of two IL33 polymorphisms, rs7044343 and rs1342326, within 200 Tunisian children, using pre-defined Taqman genotyping assays. IL-33 serum levels were assessed by commercial sandwich Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The presence of rs1342326 polymorphism was significantly associated with a lower risk of asthma development. The CC [OR = 0.20, CI (0.08-0.50)] and AC [OR = 0.24, CI (0.11-0.49)] genotypes, as well as the C-allele [OR = 0.40; CI: 0.26-0.61, P = 0.00001] were associated significantly with a decreased asthma risk. However, the C-allele was more frequent in severe asthma patients than in milder ones. No association was found between rs7044343 variant and asthma. The level of IL-33 in sera was significantly increased in asthmatic children [1.48 +/- 0.47 pg/mL] compared to controls [0.70 +/- 0.18 pg/mL; P < 0.001]. Furthermore, this increase of IL-33 was associated with the presence of rs1342326 C allele. The 7133 rs1342326 polymorphism was associated with a lower childhood asthma risk in the Tunisian population and a higher IL-33 protein expression.

AB Interleukin (IL) 13 plays a critical role in inflammatory diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). This study aims to explore the potential association of IL-13 polymorphisms with the risk of SLE. We genotyped IL-13 rs20541, rs848 and rs1295686 using Snapshot SNP genotyping assays. Plasma IL-13 level was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We found that rs20541 was associated with increased risk of SLE (CT vs. CC: adjusted OR = 1.43, 95%CI, 1.04-1.99, P = .030; TT vs. CC: adjusted OR = 1.73, 95%CI, 1.10-2.73, P = .018; CT/TT vs. CC: adjusted OR = 1.50, 95%CI, 1.10-2.04, P = .010; T vs. C adjusted OR = 1.34, 95%CI, 1.08-1.93, P = .031). CT and TT genotypes in rs20541 were associated with increased risk of renal disorder in SLE (CT vs. CC: adjusted OR = 1.97, 95%CI, 1.18-3.28, P = .009; TT vs. CC: adjusted OR = 2.42, 95%Cl, 1.22-4.77, P = .011). Moreover, The concentration of IL-13 was significantly elevated in rs20541 CT/TT genotypes compared with CC genotype (P < .001). These results suggest that rs20541 CT/TT genotypes may be a risk factor for SLE, probably by increasing the level of IL-13.

AB Mansonellosis is an endemic disease in the South and Central America. In Brazil, one of the etiological agents is Mansonella ozzardi. This filarial infection is yet poorly understood, with a controversial morbity, presenting since a oligosymptoms, malaria-like signs or without complaint in humans. The knowledge of the human immune response to microfilariae infection is limited mainly by different evolutionary cycles of the parasite in the host. In addition, the prevalence of this filarial parasite infection is high in several regions of Amazonas State. A cross-sectional study was conducted in an endemic area for microfilariae of M. ozzardi (MF) infection in the Amazonas State, Brazil. Proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines (IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF, IFN-gamma, and IL-17A) were measured in cryopreserved serum using the Cytometric Bead Array techniques (CBA) in 54 patients diagnosed with M. ozzardi infection and 55 individuals without the infection were included in the study (Controls). The IL-4, IL-6 and IL-10 level increased in infected patients with MF infection, while IL-17A increased in control only. When we compared controls to patients with high or low parasite load, the increased level of IL-6 and IL-10 were maintained. IL-6 contributes to the proinflammatory activity and IL-10 modulates Th1, Th2 and Th17 immune response. Furthermore, IL-4 was detected as a marker in the MF infection and MF patients with low parasite load, indicating the action of the Th2 cell response. The complex network of cytokines acting during M. march infection depends on a fine balance to determine a host protective effect or filarial persistence. Therefore, these results suggest that the immune response in MF infection is modulated by IL-6/IL-10 axis.

AB The present study evaluated the effects of systemic pregabalin (PG) and diclofenac (Dic) on neuropathic orofacial pain induced by chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the infraorbital nerve (ION) and on the pro-inflammatory cytokines levels in the affected nerve.
   Fifty-four rats underwent left infra orbital nerve CCI, and 7 days after the procedure as the pain developed, the rats were randomly assigned to one of the treatment groups: PG 300, 30 or 10 mg/kg, Dic 10, 5 or 1 mg/kg or saline group (Sal) (n/group = 8). Addiitonal 8 rats served as naive control group. Tactile-allodynia and Mechano-hyperalgesia were tested before the surgical procedure and at days 7, 8, and 9 postoperatively. On the 9th day, the rats were euthanized and the affected and contralateral sciatic nerves were harvested to assess IL-6 and IL-1 beta nerve levels employing enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Daily injection of PG (all doses) significantly reduced tactile-allodynia and mechano-hyperalgesia (p < .05) while Dic did not. On the 9th day, the ipsilateral nerve IL-6 levels were significantly decreased (p < .05) in the PG and DIC groups compared to the Sal group. IL-1 beta levels demonstrated a significant reduction (p < .05) in the PG group when compared to saline. These results suggest that PG but not Dic may be effective in reducing neuropathic orofacial pain. The mechanisms of action may be associated to some extent with reduction in IL-1 beta levels in the affected nerve.

AB Genome-wide association studies have identified various susceptibility variants and loci associated with incidence of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in different populations. One of these is T cell activation Rho GTPase activating protein (TAGAP). The present study sought to measure the expression of TAGAP in RA patients, CD4(+) T cells subsets from healthy humans and in mice with collagen-induced arthritis. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from RA patients and tissues of arthritic mice at different stages of the disease were used for the evaluation of TAGAP mRNA expression. Increased TAGAP expression was observed in RA patients compared to healthy controls, and there were differences in the expression level of TAGAP in the tissues of mice with experimental arthritis. Gene expression in CD4(+) T cells from healthy humans was greatest 4 h after activation and protein expression was greatest after 24 h. The expression of TAGAP was not correlated with CD4(+) lymphocyte subsets which were enriched for functionally defined subsets (Th17, Treg, Th1), further indicating its utility as an indicator of lymphocyte activation. These findings indicate that increased TAGAP expression is a distinguishing feature of inflammatory disease and further highlight the role of TAGAP in RA susceptibility.

   INDUCED REDISTRIBUTION; SUPPRESSIVE FUNCTION; EXHAUSTIVE EXERCISE
AB Strenuous exercise bouts and heavy training are associated with a heightened anti-inflammatory state and a transient suppression of several immune components. In turn, many athletes are susceptible to illness, particularly upper respiratory symptoms (e.g. cough, sore throat, running nose). T-lymphocytes (T-cells) are important for orchestrating the immune response and can be categorised into subsets according to their phenotypical characteristics resulting from polarisation (i.e. type-1, type-2 and regulatory T-cells). Each T-cell subset has a unique functional role, including their capacity to produce pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in response to an immune challenge. Prolonged and exhaustive exercise typically reduces peripheral blood type-1 T cell number and their capacity to produce the pro-inflammatory cytokine, interferon-gamma. Moreover, heavy training loads are associated with elevated numbers of resting peripheral blood type-2 and regulatory T-cells, which characteristically produce the anti-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin-4 and interleukin-10, respectively. This appears to increase the risk of upper respiratory symptoms, potentially due to the cross-regulatory effect of interleukin-4 on interferon-y production and immunosuppressive action of IL-10. Catecholamines significantly influence the number of peripheral blood T-cells in response to exercise. Whereas, glucocorticoids and prostaglandin E2 promote the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines by T-cells. In summary, strenuous exercise bouts and heavy training shifts T-cell immunity towards an anti-inflammatory state. This impairs the ability of the immune system to mount an inflammatory response to an immune challenge, which may weaken defences against intracellular pathogens (e.g. viruses), and increase the risk of infection and viral reactivation.

TI Longitudinal analysis of serum interleukin-18 in patients with familial
   Mediterranean fever carrying MEFV mutations in exon 10
SO CYTOKINE
LA English
DT Article
DE Autoinflammatory disease; Familial Mediterranean fever; MEFV; IL-18
ID CYTOKINE; NLRP3
AB Background: Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is an autoinflammatory disease caused by mutations in the MEFV gene. Mutations in exon 10 are associated with typical FMF phenotypes, and patients with exon 10 mutations have higher serum levels of interleukin (IL)-18 both during attacks and afebrile phases, compared to those without exon 10 mutations. However, longitudinal changes of serum IL-18 in FMF have not been fully characterized.
   Methods: We serially evaluated serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-18, in 12 patients with FMF carrying exon 10 mutations, all of whom showed typical FMF attacks.
   Results: Markedly high concentrations of IL-18 were observed in all patients at diagnosis (5099 +/- 6084 pg/mL). Serum IL-18 levels declined progressively after colchicine treatment in 7 patients (group A), whereas 5 patients showed continued elevation of circulating IL-18, despite declines in IL-6 and neopterin (group B). The mean follow-up times in the two groups were 4.7 +/- 3.2 and 4.8 +/- 1.5 years, respectively. The mean serum IL-18 level at the last hospital visit in group B was 4190 +/- 2610 pg/mL. There were no differences in onset age, initial IL-18 levels, and colchicine doses between the groups. FMF attacks almost disappeared in both groups, but there were trends towards more frequent subtle symptoms such as abdominal discomfort in group B.
   Conclusions: Sustained elevation of serum IL-18 may suggest the presence of persistent subclinical inflammation. Therefore, longitudinal examination of serum IL-18 may contribute to better follow-up of FMF patients with exon 10 mutations.

AB The inflammatory response may contribute to retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) dysfunction associated with the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). We investigated whether the inflammatory response affects the expression of long coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in human RPE-derived ARPE-19 cells. This class of regulatory RNA molecules recently came to prominence due to their involvement in many pathophysiological processes. A proinflammatory cytokine mixture consisting of IFN-gamma, IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha altered the expression several lncRNAs including BANCR in these cells. The cytokine responsible for increasing BANCR expression in ARPE-19 cells was found to be IFN-gamma. BANCR expression induced by IFN-gamma was suppressed when STAT1 phosphorylation was blocked by JAK inhibitor 1. Thus, proinflammatory cytokines could modulate the expression of lncRNAs in RPE cells and IFN-gamma could upregulate the expression of BANCR by activating JAK-STAT1 signaling pathway.

AB Systemic inflammation during infectious disorders usually accompanies chronic complications including cognitive dysfunction. Neuroinflammation and cognitive deficit are also observed in some debilitating neurological disorders like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Genistein is a soy isoflavone with multiple beneficial effects including anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and protective properties. In this research study, the effect of genistein in prevention of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cognitive dysfunction was investigated. LPS was given i.p. (500 mu g/kg/day) and genistein was orally given (10, 50, or 100 mg/kg) for one week. Findings showed that genistein could dose-dependently attenuate spatial recognition, discrimination, and memory deficits. Additionally, genistein treatment of LPS-challenged group lowered hippocampal level of malondialdehyde (MDA) and increased activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD)' and catalase and glutathione (GSH) level. Furthermore, genistein ameliorated hippocampal acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in LPS-challenged rats. Furthermore, genistein administration to LPS-injected group lowered hippocampal level of interleukin 6 (IL-6), nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappa B) p65, toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and increased hippo-campal level of antioxidant element nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2). In conclusion, genistein alleviated LPS-induced cognitive dysfunctions and neural inflammation attenuation of oxidative stress and AChE activity and appropriate modulation of Nrf2/NF-kappa B/IL-6/TNF alpha/COX2/iNOS/TLR4/GFAP.

AB Objectives: The objectives were to evaluate the safety and acceptability of outpatient medical abortion in selected women without a pretreatment ultrasound or pelvic examination.
   Study design: We conducted a prospective case-series study to estimate the incidence of serious adverse events (death, life-threatening event, hospitalization, transfusion or any other medical problem that we judged to be significant), surgical completion of the abortion and satisfaction in women provided with medical abortion without a pretreatment ultrasound or pelvic examination. We enrolled 406 women requesting medical abortion in Moldova, Mexico and the United States. To be eligible, a woman must have been certain that her last menstrual period started within the prior 56 days, have had regular menses before the pregnancy, not have used hormonal contraceptives in the prior 2 months (in the United States and Mexico) or 3 months (in Moldova), have no risk factors for or symptoms of ectopic pregnancy, and not have had an ultrasound or pelvic exam in this pregnancy. One site also excluded women with uterine enlargement on abdominal palpation. Each participant received mifepristone (200 mg orally) and misoprostol (400 mcg sublingually in Moldova; 800 mcg buccally at all other sites) and was followed until complete abortion, defined as requiring no further treatment.
   Results: Of the 365 (90%) participants who provided sufficient follow-up information for analysis, 347 (95%) had complete abortion without additional treatment, 5 (1%) had surgical aspiration, and 10 (3%) had extra misoprostol. Three participants (1%) had serious adverse events; these included two hospital admissions for heavy bleeding managed with aspiration and one diagnosis of persistent gestational sac 19 days after enrollment. Most (317, 90%) participants were pleased with omitting the pretreatment ultrasound and pelvic exam.
   Conclusions: In this study, medical abortion without screening ultrasound or pelvic exam resulted in no serious adverse events that were likely to have been prevented by those tests and was highly acceptable. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Objective: The objective was to examine the provision of abortion by obstetrician-gynecologists in private practice in the United States (U.S.) and their willingness to provide referrals for abortion services.
   Study design: We conducted a cross-sectional national survey of 1961 U.S. obstetrician-gynecologists to estimate the frequency with which abortions and referrals for abortion care were provided in private practice settings. Key measures included whether respondents had provided any abortions in 2013 or 2014, type of abortions provided and willingness to provide abortion referrals. Facility location by region was the only measured correlate of abortion provision.
   Results: We received a total of 988 surveys for a response rate of 65%. Sixty-seven (7%) obstetrician-gynecologists reported providing at least one abortion in 2013 or 2014, though this result ranged from 4% (n=23) to 13% (n=44) of obstetrician-gynecologists depending on survey response type. Among physicians practicing in the Northeast and West, 14% and 10%, respectively (n=24 in each region) were abortion providers compared to 4% (n=9) and 3% (n=10) of physicians in the Midwest and South, respectively. Twenty-three (42%) providers indicated only performing surgical abortions, 14 (25%) indicated only medication abortions, and 18 (33%) reported providing both. Among respondents who did not provide abortions, just over half (n=415, 54%) indicated that they referred patients to a facility or practice where they could obtain an abortion, but 271 (35%) said they would not provide a referral.
   Conclusions: Only a small proportion of all obstetrician-gynecologists in private practice settings provide abortions. Among nonproviders, a substantial minority do not offer abortion referrals. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Objective: Earlier pregnancy discovery is important in the context of prenatal and abortion care. We evaluated characteristics associated with later pregnancy discovery among women seeking abortion care.
   Study design: Data come from a survey of women seeking abortion care at four family planning facilities in Utah. The participants completed a survey during the state-mandated abortion information visit they are required to complete prior to having an abortion. The outcome in this study was pregnancy discovery before versus after 6 weeks since respondents' last menstrual period (LMP). We used logistic regression to estimate the relationship between sociodemographic and health-related independent variables of interest and pregnancy discovery before versus after 6 weeks.
   Results: Among the 458 women in the sample, 28% discovered their pregnancy later than 6 weeks since LMP. Most (n=366, 80%) knew the exact date of their LMP and a significant minority estimated it (n=92, 20%). Those who estimated the date of their LMP had higher odds of later pregnancy discovery than those who knew the exact date (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.81[1.07-3.07]). Those who used illicit drugs weekly, daily, or almost daily had higher odds of later pregnancy discovery (aOR=6.33[2.44, 16.40]).
   Conclusion: Women who did not track their menstrual periods and those who frequently used drugs had higher odds of discovering their pregnancies later. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: The objective was to determine whether types of contraceptive methods used by abortion patients in the month they became pregnant changed between 2000 and 2014.
   Study design: We used secondary data from the 2000 (n=10,015) and 2014 (8177) Abortion Patient Surveys. Patients were asked which contraceptive methods they had last used and when they had stopped or if they were still using them. The main outcome variable was type of contraceptive method used in the month the pregnancy began. We used bivariate logistic regressions to assess changes in the demographic and contraceptive use profiles of abortion patients.
   Results: In both years, slightly more than half of patients reported that they had used a contraceptive method in the month they became pregnant, though the decline from 54% in 2000 to 51% in 2014 was statistically significant (p=.011). The methods most commonly reported to have been used in the month the pregnancy began were condoms (28% and 24% in 2000 and 2014, p<.001) followed by the pill (14% and 13%, p=.12). There was a statistically significant increase in the proportion of abortion patients who reported using long-acting reversible methods in the month they got pregnant (0.1% in 2000 vs. 1% in 2014, p<.001), and the estimated number of abortions attributed to these users was greater in 2014 than in 2000 (9500 vs. 1800).
   Conclusions: Contraceptive use patterns of abortion patients were similar in both time periods, and changes in method use mirrored changes in contraceptive use among the larger population of women. (C) 2018 The Author. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Objective: The objective was to use improved measures and methodology to investigate whether race and ethnicity are associated with unintended pregnancy.
   Study design: Cross-sectional study of English-or Spanish-speaking women, aged 16-44, with pregnancies <24 weeks' gestation recruited from pregnancy testing and abortion care sites in New Haven, CT, between June 2014 and June 2015. Participants completed self-assessments of race, ethnicity and multidimensional measures of pregnancy "context," including timing, intention, wantedness, desirability, happiness and planning (measured with the London Measure of Unplanned Pregnancy). Multivariable analysis was performed, adjusting for maternal demographics, language, recruitment site, substance use and medical conditions including history of depression.
   Results: Among 161 participants (mean age=-27.2 +/- 6.6 years), mean gestational age was 9 +/- 4.6 weeks. Overall, 14% self-identified as White non-Hispanic, 37% Black non-Hispanic, 42% Hispanic and 7% multiracial. Most (85%) were unmarried, and 75% had at least one child. After adjustment, happiness about new pregnancies was more likely among Black non-Hispanic than White non-Hispanic women OR=5.66 (95%Cl: 1.51-21.20). Neither race nor ethnicity was significantly associated with pregnancy intention, wantedness, planning, timing or desirability.
   Conclusion: In a diverse cohort with multiple, antenatal measures of pregnancy context, neither race nor ethnicity is significantly associated with unintended pregnancy, as previous studies reported. Black non-Hispanic women were more likely to report happiness about new pregnancies than White non-Hispanic women. This study improves upon previous analyses that used retrospective and limited assessments of pregnancy intention, excluded women with miscarriages or abortions, and lacked adjustment for confounding.

SO CONTRACEPTION
LA English
DT Article
DE Abortion; Ultrasound; Ultrasound printout; Pregnancy
ID TERMINATION
AB Objectives: We know little about women's interest in and experiences with a printout of their preabortion ultrasound image.
   Methods: We conducted a mixed-methods study at a large-volume abortion-providing facility where patients are offered the opportunity to receive their ultrasound printout, using 2 years of abstracted medical chart data on demographics and printout acceptance and interviews with patients about whether they took a printout and, if they did, why and what they did with it. We analyzed chart data using multivariable logistic regression to examine predictors of printout acceptance and interviews using elaborative coding and modified grounded theory.
   Results: We abstracted data from 5342 charts and interviewed 23 women. Thirty-eight percent of all patients and 61% of interviewees accepted the printout. Predictors of accepting the printout included being younger, being nonwhite, having a partner who is a boyfriend or friend, and not having a support person at the visit. Interviewees reported that they accepted the printout simply because it was offered, out of curiosity and as part of confirming their abortion decision. They described various uses for the printout, including sharing with others, consulting before their abortion appointment, retaining as a keepsake and nothing at all.
   Conclusions: Some abortion patients are interested in receiving a printout of their ultrasound image and find it useful. Women accept a printout for a range of reasons and use it in various ways; there is no singular experience or use of the printout. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID MIFEPRISTONE; MISOPROSTOL; TRIAL
AB Objectives: We aimed to evaluate compliance with a strategy to enable medical abortion patients to assess treatment outcome on their own and decide whether to seek clinical follow-up.
   Study design: We enrolled women undergoing medical abortion with mifepristone and misoprostol at three clinics in the United States. Each participant was instructed to perform a multilevel pregnancy test (MLPT) 7 days after mifepristone ingestion and to contact the clinic immediately if the test indicated a possible ongoing pregnancy or if specified symptoms occurred. A telephone call was scheduled 14 days after mifepristone ingestion to evaluate participants who had not contacted the clinic earlier.
   Results: Of the 343 enrolled participants, 90 (26%) did not provide sufficient follow-up information for analysis of compliance with instructions. Of the 253 (74%) who did, 218 (86%) implemented the self-assessment strategy as instructed, 20 (7.9%) failed to report a non reassuring MLPT result, 4 (1.6%) failed to promptly report symptoms that the study clinician subsequently judged to require evaluation, and 11 (4.3%) did not perform the MLPT. We ascertained abortion outcomes for 239 (70%) of the enrolled women, of whom three were diagnosed with ongoing pregnancies. One other participant was hospitalized for bleeding. All four women had implemented the strategy correctly. Of the 219 enrolled participants (64%) who provided opinions, 170 (78%) indicated that most could use the MLPT to decide whether they are "OK" after an abortion. We did not ascertain opinions from 124 enrolled participants (36%).
   Conclusions: At least two thirds of enrolled participants correctly implemented a strategy using symptom evaluation and a MLPT to assess their own medical abortion outcomes. No ongoing pregnancies occurred in women documented not to have implemented the strategy as intended. Perceived feasibility of the self-assessment approach was high. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB Objective: To explore patient experiences of contraceptive coercion by healthcare providers at time of abortion.
   Study Design: We conducted a qualitative study of English-speaking women seeking abortion services at a hospital-based clinic. We used the Integrated Behavioral Model and the Reproductive Autonomy Scale to inform our semi-structured interview guide; the Scale provides a framework of reproductive coercion as a lack of autonomy or power to decide about and control decisions relating to reproduction. We enrolled participants until thematic saturation was achieved. Two coders used modified grounded theory to analyze transcribed interviews with Nvivo 11.0 (K=0.81).
   Results: The 31 women we interviewed from June 2016 to March 2017 were all in the first trimester, and predominantly young (mean age 27 5 years), non-Hispanic Black (52%) and Medicaid-insured (68%). Some participants (42%) reported feeling "pressured" into choosing some form of contraception. A subset of participants (26%) voiced that providers seemed to prefer LARC methods or were "pushing" a specific method. Several participants perceived pressure to choose any method due to providers' preference to prevent repeat abortions. Conversely, participants who were offered a range of methods through the use of decision aids and who were given time to deliberate demonstrated more reproductive autonomy.
   Conclusions: Almost half of participants perceived a form of coercion around their contraceptive counseling. Coercion manifested in perceived provider preference for specific methods or immediate initiation of a method. Participant narratives involving decision aids to offer a range of methods and time for deliberation demonstrated greater reproductive autonomy and less coercion. Abortion stigma may mediate potentially coercive interactions between patients and providers. Published by Elsevier Inc.

   effectiveness
ID NATIONAL-COMORBIDITY-SURVEY; UNITED-STATES; UNINTENDED PREGNANCY;
   HEALTH; DISORDERS; CHOICE
AB Objective: We examined whether preabortion depressive symptoms were associated with contraceptive method effectiveness level chosen among women seeking abortions.
   Study design: Three-hundred and forty-seven young, low-income women 18 years or older who were seeking abortions at 3 community reproductive health clinics in Northern California were recruited to participate in a study on contraceptive decision making. We classified women into choosing low-, moderate-or high-effectiveness contraceptive methods based on typical-use failure rates. We used the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale to assess depressive symptoms as a continuous and dichotomous variable. Using the standard cutoff of 20, women who scored at or above this were considered depressed for the dichotomous measure. We used multinomial logistic regression to examine the association between preabortion depressive symptoms and contraceptive effectiveness level chosen to use after an abortion, adjusting for sociodemographics, abortion characteristics, pregnancy history, future pregnancy desires, relationship characteristics and adverse experiences.
   Results: After adjusting for covariates, we found that a one-unit increase in depressive symptoms was associated with a higher likelihood of choosing low-versus moderate-[adjusted odd ratio (aOR) = 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01-1.10, p<.02] and high-effectiveness methods (aOR = 1.05, 95% Cl: 1.002-1.10, p<.05). Furthermore, women scoring above the cutoff for depression were more likely to choose low-versus moderate-effectiveness methods (aOR=4.56, 95% Cl: 1.27-16.32, p=.02).
   Conclusions: More preabortion depressive symptoms were independently associated with choosing low-versus moderate-and high-effectiveness contraceptives.
   Implications: These findings together with other findings show that preabortion depressive symptoms do not uniformly influence effectiveness level of contraceptive method selected to use after an abortion. Reproductive health care providers should consider the impact of women's psychological symptoms on their contraceptive decision making. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID NATIONAL-SURVEY; AVAILABILITY; PROGRAM
AB Objective: The Midwest Access Project (MAP) offers opt-in training to students, residents and practicing clinicians in reproductive health care including abortion. We surveyed MAP alumni to identify current practice characteristics and assess predictors of reproductive health service provision.
   Study design: We sent an online survey to alumni of MAP's Individual Clinical Training program, 2007-2015 (n=127). The primary outcome was current provision of any abortion service. Secondary outcomes included providing specific abortion services and other reproductive services.
   Results: We received responses from 61% of eligible MAP alumni (n=77 out of 127). The majority reported a specialty of Family Medicine (68%) and current location in the Midwest (52%). Among current residents, fellows or clinicians practicing in a field whose scope includes abortion (n=56), 50% provide abortion. Most (84%) provide outpatient miscarriage management, and nearly all (>= 96%) provide pregnancy options counseling and full scope contraception. Respondents who received the most advanced training in medication abortion as part of their MAP training were more likely to report providing abortion in their current practice than those who did not (63% vs. 32%, p=.027), as were those who completed more than one MAP rotation compared to those who completed one rotation (100% vs. 44%, p=.009).
   Conclusions: Half of MAP's alumni provide some abortion care. Nearly all provide comprehensive counseling and contraceptive services.
   Implications: Opt-in training is a promising strategy to develop providers of comprehensive reproductive health care. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Researchers traditionally rely on participant self-report for contraceptive use. We hypothesized that self-reported contraceptive use by clinical research participants may disagree with objectively measured hormonal status.
   Study design: We enrolled women in Harare, Zimbabwe, aged 18-34, who by self-report had not used hormonal or intrauterine contraception for >30 days, or depot medroxyprogesterone acetate for >10 months, into a study designed to assess biologic changes with contraceptive initiation and use. Blood samples obtained at enrollment and each follow-up visit (N=1630 from 447 participants) were evaluated by mass spectrometry for exogenous hormones. We individually interviewed a subset of participants (n=20) with discrepant self-reported and measured serum hormones to better understand nondisclosure of contraceptive use.
   Results: Discrepant with self-reported nonuse of hormonal contraception, synthetic progestogens were detectable in 120/447 (27%, 95% confidence interval 23%-31%) enrolled women. Measured exogenous hormones consistent with use of contraceptive pills (n=102), injectables (n=20) and implants (n=3) were detected at enrollment, with 7 women likely using >1 contraceptive. In-depth interviews revealed that participants understood the requirement to be hormone free at enrollment (100%). Most (85%) cited partner noncooperation with condoms/withdrawal and/or pregnancy concerns as major reasons for nondisclosed contraceptive use. All interviewed women (100%) cited access to health care as a primary motivation for study participation. Of participants who accurately reported nonuse of hormonal contraception at enrollment, 41/327 (12.5%) had objective evidence of nonstudy progestin use at follow-up that disagreed with self-reported nonuse.
   Conclusions: Women joining contraceptive research studies may misrepresent their use of nonstudy contraceptive hormones at baseline and follow-up. Objective measures of hormone use are needed to ensure that study population exposures are accurately categorized.
   Implications statement: Among Zimbabwean women participating in a contraceptive research study, 27% had objective evidence of use of nonstudy contraceptives at enrollment that disagreed with self-report. Studies that rely on self-report to identify contraceptive hormone exposure could suffer from significant misclassification. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Objective: The objective was to assess the extent of concordance between self-reported contraceptive use and the presence of contraceptive progestins in serum.
   Study design: We evaluated self-reported contraceptive use by using radioimmunoassay to examine baseline serum levels of medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) and levonorgestrel (LNG) among 97 Malawian women enrolling in a contraceptive trial.
   Results: Twelve percent (12/97) of study participants who reported no hormonal contraceptive use in the previous 6 months had either MPA or LNG detected in their serum.
   Conclusions: The observed discordance between self-report and detection of exogenous hormones in serum indicates that caution is warranted when drawing conclusions based on self-reported contraceptive use. Published by Elsevier Inc.

ID HIV ACQUISITION; EPIDEMIOLOGIC EVIDENCE; ORAL-CONTRACEPTION;
   CLINICAL-TRIAL; RISK; TRANSMISSION; PREVENTION
AB Objectives: Studies that rely on self-report to investigate the relationship between hormonal contraceptive use and HIV acquisition and transmission, as well as other health outcomes, could have compromised results due to misreporting. We determined the frequency of misreported hormonal contraceptive use among African women with and at risk for HIV.
   Study design: We tested 1102 archived serum samples from 664 African women who had participated in prospective HIV prevention studies. Using a novel high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry assay, we quantified exogenous hormones for injectables (medroxyprogesterone acetate or norethisterone), oral contraceptives (OC) (levonorgestrel or ethinyl estradiol) and implants (levonorgestrel or etonogestrel) and compared them to self-reported use.
   Results: Among women reporting hormonal contraceptive use, 258/358 (72%) of samples were fully concordant with self-report, as were 642/744 (86%) of samples from women reporting no hormonal contraceptive use. However, 42/253 (17%) of samples from women reporting injectable use, 41/66 (62%) of samples from self-reported OC users and 3/39 (8%) of samples from self-reported implant users had no quantifiable hormones. Among self reported nonusers, 102/744 (14%) had hormone present. Concordance between self-reported method and exogenous hormones did not differ by HIV status.
   Conclusion: Among African women with and at risk for HIV, testing of exogenous hormones revealed agreement with self-reported contraceptive use for most women. However, unexpected exogenous hormones were identified among self-reported hormonal contraceptive users and nonusers, and an important fraction of women reporting hormonal contraceptive use had no hormones detected; absence of oral contraceptive hormones could be due, at least in part, to samples taken during the hormone-free interval. Misreporting of hormonal contraceptive use could lead to biased results in observational studies of the relationship between contraceptive use and health outcomes.
   Implications: Research studies investigating associations between hormonal contraceptive use and HIV should consider validating self-reported use by objective measures; because both overreporting and underreporting of use occur, potential misclassification based on self-report could lead to biased results in directions that cannot be easily predicted.

AB Objective: The objective was to develop a method to simultaneously quantify five commonly used hormonal contraceptives (HCs) and two endogenous sex steroids by liquid chromatography-tandem triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and apply this method to human serum samples.
   Study design: We developed a method to simultaneously analyze ethinyl estradiol (EE2), etonogestrel (ENG), levonorgestrel (LNG), medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) and norethisterone (NET), along with estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4), in human serum for a Shimadzu Nexera-LCMS-8050 LC-MS/MS platform. We analyzed serum collected from women self-reporting use of oral contraceptives, contraceptive implants or injectable contraceptives (n=14) and normally cycling women using no HC (n=15) as well as pooled samples from women administered various HCs (ENG, n=6; LNG, n=14; MPA, n=7; NET, n=5).
   Results: Limits of quantitation were 0.010 ng/mL for E2, EE2 and P4; 0.020 ng/mL for ENG, LNG and MPA; and 0.040 ng/mL for NET. Precisions for all assays, as indicated by coefficient of variation, were less than or equal to 12.1%. Accuracies for all assays were in the range of 95%-108%. Endogenous hormone values obtained from analysis of human serum samples are in agreement with levels previously reported in the literature for normally cycling women as well as for women taking the appropriate HC.
   Conclusions: We have developed a robust, accurate and sensitive method for simultaneously analyzing commonly used contraceptive steroids and endogenous sex steroids in human serum. Implications: This analytical method can be used for quantitating contraceptive steroid levels in women for monitoring systemic exposure to determine drug interactions, nonadherence, misreporting and proper dosing.

AB Graphene can be used to avoid the oxidation of metallic films. This work explores the effectiveness of such stabilizing effect on Cobalt (Co) films intercalated between Graphene and Ir(111). After intercalation at 300 degrees C, two Co films are exposed to ambient pressure and investigated using Co-K edge X-ray Absorption Near Edge Spectroscopy. The formation of a disordered oxide phase is observed, and associated to the presence of some non-intercalated Co. Further annealing at 500 degrees C causes the oxide reduction to metallic Co which further intercalates below the Graphene. Once the intercalation is completed, Graphene prevents the Co from oxidation under ambient pressure conditions. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Reduced graphene oxide (RGO) films intercalated with various polymers were fabricated by reaction-based self-assembly, and their characteristics as vacuum pressure sensors based on van der Waals interactions were studied. At low temperature, the electrical resistances of the samples decrease linearly with increasing vacuum pressure, whereas at high temperature the variation of the electrical resistance shows secondary order curves. Among all samples, the poly vinyl alcohol intercalated RGO shows the highest sensitivity, being almost two times more sensitive than reference RGO. All samples show almost the same signal for repetitive sudden pressure changes, indicating reasonable reproducibility and durability. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The paper demonstrates that the reason of SERS on dielectrics and semiconductors is the enhancement of the electric field in the regions of the tops of the surface roughness with a very large positive curvature. The enhancement in many ways depends on the dielectric constant of the substrate and is stronger for a larger dielectric constant. The theoretical result points out that on dielectrics and semiconductors it is weaker than on metals. Experimentally it is demonstrated that there are forbidden lines on hydroquinone, adsorbed on TiO2, which indicate on the existence of strong quadrupole light-molecule interaction in such systems.

AB We investigate the performance of broadband adiabatic inversion pulses in the high-power (short high-powered adiabatic pulse, SHAP) and low-power (single-sideband-selective adiabatic pulse, S(3)AP) RF regimes on a spin system subjected to large anisotropic interactions. We show by combined experimental results and spin dynamics simulations that when the magic-angle spinning rate exceeds 100 kHz S(3)APs begin outperforming SHAPs. This is especially true for low-gamma nuclei, such as Li-6 in paramagnetic Li-ion battery materials. Finally, we show how S3APs can be improved by combining multiple waveforms sweeping over multiple sidebands simultaneously, in order to produce inverted sideband profiles free from intensity biasing.

AB We present single particle studies on gold nanourchins (AuNUs) for their use as localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) biosensors under dark-field (DF) microscopy. First, the LSPR wavelength of single AuNUs was red-shifted as thiol molecules were attached onto the surface. AuNUs with sharp tips showed higher sensitivity for detecting thiol molecules than gold nanospheres (AuNSs) of similar size. Second, the degree of red shift was affected by the electrophilicity of adsorbate molecules on the nanoparticle surface. Last, real-time monitoring of molecular binding events on single AuNUs was achieved with introducing 1 mu M of 4-aminothiophenol. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It was found out that LZ7C3 powders had a pyrochlore structure after being heat-treated at temperatures higher than 1473 K or higher according to XRD and TEM results. The calculated average thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) was 7.12 x 10(-6) K-1, which is a little smaller than experiment result, but changes of calculated average TECs of LZ, YSZ and LZ7C3 had the same trend with experimental results. Finally, the radial distribution function (RDF) was calculated to study the phase stability of LZ7C3. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The DDI channels involved with dehydrogenation are revealed and it's believed both the charge distribution and the bound character of real potential energy surfaces of parent ions play important roles in the dissociation process. The relationship between the potential energy surfaces of the precursor species and the photofragment ejection angles are also discussed and analyzed. Furthermore, the competition between the DDI channels has been studied and the CAC bond cleavages dominate the DDI process at relative higher laser intensity. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB In shallow-water systems with calm hydrodynamic, dense vegetation stands provide most of the available surface for periphyton development. The large ratio between biological active surfaces and water volume amplifies the influence of biofilm activity on water chemistry, resulting the key factor responsible for nitrogen removal performance of wetlands and waterways. However, the denitrification capacity of biofilms on emergent macrophytes remains understudied, especially if investigated on dead stems during the non-vegetative season.
   The aims of the present study were: 1) to quantify the role of biofilms colonizing dead stems of Phragmites australis in NO3- mitigation via denitrification in winter (similar to 11 degrees C) in a NO3- -rich drainage canal; 2) to determine how the biofilm denitrifying capacity varies as a function of water velocity (0-6 cm s(-1)). Denitrification was assessed by the concomitant measurements of NO3- consumption and N2 production from analyses of N-2:Ar by Membrane Inlet Mass Spectrometry.
   Sediments with biofilms were found more efficient in converting NO3- to N-2 (7-17 mmol N m(-2) d(-1)) than bare sediments (3-5 mmol N m(-2) d(-1)). Denitrification activity in biofilms responded positively to increasing water velocity that enhanced the rate of NO3- supply to the active surfaces.
   Results of the present study showed that denitrification performed by biofilms on senescent stems proceeds beyond the vegetative season throughout the cold period and maintains the depuration capacity when drainage canals may still drive high NO3- loads leached from the agricultural fields. The development of a diversified and extended microbial community throughout the year together with water velocity should be taken into account as key elements in the management of the canal networks aimed at combining hydrological needs and water quality goals.

AB Climate change will lead to increased frequencies of weather extremes in Central Europe, such as severe heat waves and droughts, causing high stress intensities for plants. Drought stress also represents a critical factor on many re-cultivated areas with poor edaphic conditions and small soil depths. This includes living wall systems which are applied to cover shotcrete walls and re-integrate them in landscape surroundings. Due to the vertical arrangement of these systems, which limits absorption of rain water, artificial irrigation was considered mandatory, but experimental evidence is lacking. Therefore, we compared soil and plant water relations of test plots on a 'Green wall' system with active and deactivated irrigation. During the vegetation period 2017, soil water potential and plant hydraulic parameters (stomatal conductance, relative water content, midday leaf water potential and osmotic potential) of Phleum pratense, the dominating grass on study plots, were measured.
   In summer 2017, many weeks with humid weather conditions, but also a pronounced heat period were registered. During this period, considerable physiological responses were observed and respective recovery after subsequent days of heavy precipitation. Phleum pratense showed reductions in stomatal conductance (- 148.6 +/- 118.8 mmolm(-2) s(-1)), relative water content (- 9.3 +/- 10.1%) and midday leaf water potential (- 0.3 +/- 0.5 MPa) on the test plot during heat days. Upon precipitation, differences in water relations between plots ceased within few days. Results indicate that integrated irrigation systems are a necessary component of living wall systems.

AB Do semi-fossorial herbivores influence the trajectory of plant community succession by altering belowground bud density in alpine meadows? Field surveys were carried out to investigate the effect of disturbance and disturbance intensity of the plateau pika (Ochotona curzoniae) on the belowground bud density in alpine meadows at two sites. The Linear Mixed Model (LMM) test and Linear Model (LM) test were used to analyze the relative effect of plateau pika disturbance on bud density and to clarify the response of belowground bud density to disturbance intensity. Our results showed that disturbance by the plateau pika increased belowground bud density of graminoids and plants from the grass and sedge families, including Kobresia pygmaea and Elymus nutans, but had no effect on forbs bud density. The bud density of graminoids, grass and sedge plants, and K. pygmaea and E. nutans showed a downward parabolic trend in response to increased disturbance intensity of the plateau pika, implying that there was an optimal level of disturbance intensity that maximized belowground bud density of graminoids. These results suggest that disturbance by the plateau pika has different effects on belowground bud densities of graminoids versus forbs. Additionally, disturbance by plateau pika up to the optimal intensity may improve grazing quality of alpine meadow in the long term through increasing graminoid bud density, resulting in a higher proportion of graminoids in pasture, while higher levels of disturbance by plateau pika may deteriorate alpine meadows through a reduction in graminoid bud density.

AB Bubble-plume mixing systems are often deployed in eutrophic lakes and reservoirs to manage phytoplankton taxa. Unfortunately, inconsistent outcomes from bubble-plume (induced) mixing are often reported in the literature. The present study investigates the response of phytoplankton to induced mixing using a whole-reservoir field experiment and a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model (Si3D) coupled with the Aquatic EcoDynamics (AED) model through the framework for aquatic biogeochemical modelling (FABM). The coupled Si3D-AED model is validated against a 24-h field mixing experiment and subsequently used for a numerical parametric study to investigate phytoplankton responses to various induced mixing scenarios in which the phytoplankton settling rate, phytoplankton growth rate, reservoir depth, and mixing system diffuser depth were sequentially varied. Field observations during the mixing experiment suggest that the total phytoplankton concentration (measured in mu g/L) across the reservoir was reduced by nearly 10% during the 24-h mixing period. The numerical modeling results show that phytoplankton concentration may be substantially affected by the functional traits of the phytoplankton and the deployment depth of the mixing diffuser. Interestingly, the numerical results indicate that the phytoplankton concentration is controlled by reduced growth rates due to light limitation in deep reservoirs (> 20 m), whereas settling loss is a more important factor in shallow reservoirs during the mixing period. In addition, the coupled Si3D-AED model results suggest that deploying the mixing diffuser deeper in the water column to increase mixing depth may generally improve the successful management of cyanobacteria using bubble-plume mixing systems. Thus, the coupled Si3D-AED model introduced in the present study can assist with the design and operation of bubble-plume mixing systems.

AB The presence of macrophytes is a key factor that determines good water quality in eutrophic lakes, and control of their presence is desirable to establish a clean water state. However, the subject is frequently discussed due to the intensive growth of aquatic plants that can restrict functioning of the reservoir (e.g., for swimming, fishing, etc.). Overgrowth of macrophytes also causes terrestrialisation processes of lakes, which occur very intensively in shallow and lowland artificial reservoirs. In order to analyse the contribution of macrophytes to nutrient reduction in lakes and investigate the possibility of using aquatic plants in reservoir recultivation, we investigated the nutrient budget of two artificial reservoirs located in Wielkopolska (Poland) with particular attention on macrophytes and nutrient pollution sources. To determine the loads with internal and external nutrients, we analysed the land use in the respective catchment areas, ground water quality, sewage management, quality and quantity of surface waters supplied to lakes (rivers and ditches), water, macrophytes and sediment quality in the reservoirs. Our results indicate that in both analysed catchments, the major source of nutrients is unregulated sewage systems. This demonstrates why improvement of sewage management is vital for increased water quality and more effective functioning of water reservoirs. We also propose methods to reduce the amount of nutrients directly supplied to lakes from agricultural lands. Our findings suggest that the mowing of macrophytes can reduce nutrient concentrations in the reservoirs. However, its impact is not particularly significant in comparison with the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus supplied from internal sources. Moreover, our study shows that growth limitation of particular species can stimulate growth of a desired species (e.g., charophytes). Controlled removal of macrophytes may also stimulate their intensive growth and possibly give rise to an increase in the amount of nutrients immobilised in the lake.

AB To balance the conservation value versus recreational use of shallow lakes, moderate herbivory may be needed in eutrophic lakes to avoid near surface growth while maintaining high vegetation biomass close to the sediment. However, over-grazing or even complete elimination of macrophytes by grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) commonly used for control purposes has often been observed, leading to a shift from a clear to a turbid phytoplankton-dominated state. We hypothesized that slow-growing and smaller-sized herbivorous fish species might be more suitable than grass carp to obtain the desired moderate control because they consume the top part of the vegetation without severely affecting the lower plant parts. To test the hypothesis, the effects of Wuchang bream (Megalobrama amblycephala), an endemic medium-sized herbivorous cyprinid, and grass carp on the biomass, density and trait of the macrophyte Vallisneria denseserrulata were compared in an enclosure experiment. We found that V. denseserrulata grew less tall but did not lose biomass under moderate herbivory by Wuchang bream due to increased plant density and leaf weight per length, whereas excessive herbivory by grass carp had strong negative effects on the plant biomass. Moreover, the plant had more and thicker leaves in the fish treatments than in the fishless controls. The growth of grass carp was much faster than that of Wuchang bream. Our findings suggest that stocking of Wuchang bream in proper densities may be more useful than grass carp for the management of V. denseserrulata and likely also other macrophyte species. More tests, especially at different fish densities are, however, needed to draw any firm conclusions regarding this hypothesis.

AB Human activities and environmental degradation have resulted in landscape structure changes and can eventually affect the ecosystem service value (ESV) of its region. Nevertheless, research on the spatial correlations between ESVs and landscape pattern changes is lacking. Thus, 13 landscape metrics and nine ESV types in Ebinur Lake Basin were chosen and used to analyse their spatial correlations using multiple linear regression models in this study. The results revealed that eight out of the 13 landscape metrics showed direct spatial correlations with ESV type, and there were landscape metrics that were positively and negatively correlated with the different ESV types. The interspersion and juxtaposition index (IJI), patch richness (PR), and patch richness density (PRD) had no effects on the provision of ESVs. The results also showed that the land-use/land-cover classification types play a linking role, as changes in land-use/land-cover affect the provision of ESVs and the fragmentation of landscape patterns. At the same time, the total ESV of Ebinur Lake Basin was 21.21x10(9) CNY in 2014. Wood and grassland contributed the highest ESV in Ebinur Lake Basin, i.e., 16.29x10(9) CNY, followed by water bodies and farmland, i.e., 1.785x10(9) CNY and 1.239x10(9) CNY, respectively. The regression models that were obtained quantitatively assessed how the changes in landscape patterns have affected the provision of ESVs. These models greatly contribute to the application of the ecosystem service approach in research as well as in practice and provide a better understanding of landscape planning in Ebinur Lake Basin.

AB Two medium bandgap polymers (ffQx-TS1, ffQx-TS2) were designed and synthesized to investigate the influence of different alkylthio side chain on the morphology and photovoltaic performance of non-fullerene polymer solar cells (PSCs). Both polymers exhibit similar molecular weights and comparable the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level. However, the polymer with straight alkylthio chain delivers a root-mean-square (RMS) of 0.86 nm, which is slightly lower than that with branched chain (1.40 nm). The lower RMS benefits the ohmic contact between the active lay and interface layer, thus enhanced short circuit current (J(sc)) (from 13.54 mA cm(-1) to 15.25 mA cm(-1)) could be obtained. Due to the enhancement of J(sc), better power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.69% for ffQx-TS2 could be realized. These results indicated that alkylthio side chain engineering is a promising method to improve photovoltaic performance. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB SmCo5/FeCo core/shell composites were fabricated through a magnetic self-assembly process. The core/shell structure was confirmed by TEM image. The effects of the mass percentage of FeCo nanoparticles on the magnetic exchange coupling between SmCo5 and FeCo were investigated. The results showed that a higher mass percentage of FeCo nanoparticles led to a weaker magnetic exchange coupling between SmCo5 and FeCo. The magnetic exchange coupling was beneficial to increase the (BH)(max) of composites. The maximum (BH) max of SmCo5/FeCo composite was obtained when FeCo was 10 wt%, achieving a 25% increase from single hard phase SmCo5. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB An MP2/6-311++G(3df, 3pd) computational study of a series of hydrogen-bonded complexes X3CH center dot center dot center dot YZ (X = Cl, F, NC; YZ = FLi, BF, CO, N-2) was undertaken to assess the trends in the relative stability and other molecular properties with variation of both the X group and the chemical hardness of the Y atom of YZ. The red-and blue-shifting propensities of the proton donor X3CH were investigated by considering the C-H bond length change and its associated vibrational frequency shift. The proton donor Cl3CH, which has a positive dipole moment derivative with respect to C-H bond extension, tends to form red-shifted complexes, this tendency being modified by the hardness (and dipole moment) associated with the proton acceptor. On the other hand, F3CH has a negative dipole moment derivative and tends to form blue-shifted complexes, suggesting that as X becomes more electron-withdrawing, the proton donor should have a negative dipole moment derivative and form blue-shifted complexes. Surprisingly, the most polar proton donor (NC)(3)CH was found to have a positive dipole moment derivative and produces red-shifted complexes. A perturbative model was found useful in rationalizing the trends for the C-H bond length change and associated frequency shift. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Adsorption and diffusion of an equimolar feed mixture of CO2 and CO in MIL-127 at three different temperatures and pressures up to 12 bar were investigated by molecular simulations. The adsorption was simulated using Gibbs-Ensemble Monte Carlo (GEMC). The structure of the adsorbed phase and the diffusion in the MIL were investigated using Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. The adsorption selectivity of MIL-127 for CO2 over CO at 233 K was about 15. When combining adsorption and diffusion selectivities, a membrane selectivity of about 12 is predicted. For higher temperatures, both adsorption and diffusion selectivity are found to be smaller. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The resultant energy of solvent H-O bond exothermic elongation by O:double left right arrow:O repulsion, featured at <3100 cm(-1), and the solute H-O bond endothermic contraction by bond-order-deficiency, at 3610 cm(-1), heats up the (Li, Na, K) OH solutions. The solution temperature increases linearly with the number fraction of the ordinary O:H-O bonds transiting into their hydration states. The elongated H-O bond emits >150% the O:H cohesive energy of 0.095 eV that caps the energy dissipating by molecular motion, thermal fluctuation, diffusion, and even evaporation. Therefore, the intramolecular H-O bond relaxation dictates the OH- solvation bonding thermodynamics and the performance of basic solutions. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The asymptotic projection technique is used to investigate the polarization effect that arises from the interaction between the relaxed, and frozen monomeric charge densities of a set of neutral and charged hydrogen bonded complexes. The AP technique based on the resolution of the original Kohn-Sham equations can give an acceptable qualitative description of the polarization effect in neutral complexes. The significant overlap of the electron densities, in charged and pi-conjugated complexes, impose further development of a new functional, describing the coupling between constrained and non-constrained electron densities within the AP technique to provide an accurate representation of the polarization effect.

AB Molecular dynamics simulation (MD) of the observed stepwise oxidation of core-shell structured Al/Al2O3 nanoparticles is presented. Different from the metal ion hopping process in the Cabrera-Mott model, which is assumed to occur only at a certain distance from the oxide layer, the MD simulation shows that Al atoms jump over various interfacial gaps directly under the thermal driving force. The energy barrier for Al ionization is found to be increased along with the enlargement of interfacial gap. A mechanism of competition between thermal driving force and ionization potential barrier is proposed in the interpretation of stepwise oxidation behavior. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Photonic properties and refractive indexes of the TBADN films were investigated with various experimental and theoretical methods. The effects of the film thicknesses on the photonic properties of the TBADN films were examined. It was found that while the optical band gap of the TBADN film decreases with increasing film thickness, the refractive indexes exhibit a normal dispersion behavior for both experimental and theoretical techniques. This study shows that the most suitable optoelectronic parameters for optoelectronic devices can be achieved with film thicknesses. The TBADN molecule was found to have a lower refractive index in the chloroform solvent. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Analysis of the luminescence excitation spectra, luminescence spectra themselves and temporal behaviors of the luminescence intensities of the transitions observed has been carried out. The NeI2(E,v(E),n(E)) luminescence has been discovered. This is the first direct observation of a halogen molecule vdW complex luminescence. It has also been found that lifetime of the NeI2(E,v(E),n(E)) complex depends on the v(E) value: it is equal to 8 ns for the NeI2(E,v(E) = 0, n(E)) when vibrational predissociation (VP) is impossible and <= 2 ns when VP channels are open.

AB Using the time dependent density functional theory calculations, we investigate how the optical response in Aluminium nanorod dimers evolve as a function of different tuning parameters such as gap distances (3-14 angstrom), structural configurations (compact, hollow and a combination of both) and relative spatial orientations (parallel and axial linkages). We found that the position and amplitude of the gap plasmons are continuously modified with decreasing gap distances in the case of nanorod dimer composed of compact structures, and below 6 angstrom, the electron tunnelling emerges in agreement with recent experiments. We have also investigated the gap plasmon modifications by placing a conducting molecule in the inter-particle gap region and found the molecule short circuits the junction and decreases the optical enhancement.

AB QTAIM and the stress tensor were used to provide a detailed analysis of the topology of the molecular graph, BCP and bond-path properties, including the new introduced helicity length H, of a Tyr-Gly dipeptide conformer subjected to a torsion with four levels of theory; MP2, M06-2X, B3LYP-D3 and B3LYP and a modest-sized basis set, 6-31+G(d).
   Structural effects and bonding properties are quantified and reflect differences in the BSSE and lack of inclusion of dispersion effects in the B3LYP calculations. The helicity length H demonstrated that MP2 produced a unique response to the torsion suggesting future use as a diagnostic tool. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Solution processability of the precursor molecules is a major issue owing to their limited solubility for the synthesis of conjugated polymers. Therefore, we favour the solvent free solid state chemical oxidative polymerization route for the synthesis of diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) based donor-acceptor (D-A) type conjugated polymers. D-A type polymer Poly(S-OD-EDOT) which contains DPP coupled with EDOT donor units is synthesized via solid state polymerization method. The polymer is employed as an active layer for organic field-effect transistors to measure charge transport properties. The Polymer shows good hole mobility 3.1 x 10(-2) cm(2) V-1 s(-1), with a on/off ratio of 1.1 x 10(3). (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB An extensive replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulation was performed to investigate the progress patterns of the molecular interactions of propafenone and A beta(16-22) system. Distinct conformational equilibrium of A beta(16-22) system with and without propafenone was analyzed in detail. Propafenone can act to prevent the Alzheimer's disease (AD) by significantly inhibiting Ab oligomerization. Our calculated results provide insights into the inhibition mechanism of propafenone on the oligomerization process to form A beta(16-22) peptide aggregation. These findings are valuable for the development of therapeutic drugs in the AD early stage. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We performed benchmark studies on the molecular geometry, electron properties and vibrational analysis of imidazole using semi-empirical, density functional theory and post Hartree-Fock methods. These studies validated the use of AM1 for the treatment of larger systems. Then, we treated the structural, physical and chemical relationships for a series of imidazole derivatives acting as angiotensin II AT1 receptor blockers using AM1. QSAR studies were done for these imidazole derivatives using a combination of various physicochemical descriptors. A multiple linear regression procedure was used to design the relationships between molecular descriptor and the activity of imidazole derivatives. Results validate the derived QSAR model.

ID CONICAL INTERSECTIONS; MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; WAVE-FUNCTIONS
AB The nonadiabatic coupling terms (NACTs, F-ij's) between triplet electronic states can be well approximated with a very simple equation suggested recently [J.Chem.Phys. 146, 064107 (2017)], using only adiabatic potential energies (V-i(a) and V-j(a)). Furthermore, the second-order differentiation can be evaluated accurately from the energy gaps, V-i(a) - V-j(a), at just three consecutive geometries, even at a point exhibiting severe singularity in the behaviour of NACTs. The performance of this approximation method was investigated for the couplings between the 3(3)Pi and 4(3)Pi states of NaK, between the 1(3)B(3u) and 2(3)B(3u) states of N-2, and between the 2(3)A '' and 3(3)A '' states of methylene (CH2).

The response of both towards F- ion has been monitored by UV-Vis and H-1 NMR spectroscopy as well as naked eye color change. Interestingly, change in acceptor unit endows ADAMN to behave as a INHIBIT logic gate with F- and H+ as inputs whereas ANOPD remains totally silent towards F-.

AB Chiral organosilica particles of size similar to 200 nm were synthesized from an enantio-pure multi-armed chiral D-maltose organosilane precursor in the absence of co-condensation with an achiral monomer. Two distinct experiments were performed to demonstrate the particles' ability to induce conformational deracemization of a host liquid crystal. The first involves an electric field-induced tilt of the liquid crystal director in the deracemized smectic-A phase. The other involves domain wall curvature separating left-and right-handed liquid crystal helical pitch domains imposed by the cells' substrates. The results demonstrate unequivocally that enantio-pure organosilica nanoparticles can be synthesized and can induce chirality in a host. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The non-resonant X-ray emission spectroscopy of fullerenes and carbon nanotubes is studied with density functional theory in conjunction with short-range corrected functionals. For C-60 and C-70 the X-ray emission spectra are insensitive to modest structural changes, and absorption onto the fullerene cage has the greatest effect with a broader less structured band observed with the high energy pi band reduced in intensity. For carbon nanotubes the X-ray emission spectra are shown to be weakly dependent on the length and chirality of the nanotube. However, some variation with the diameter of the tube is observed in both resonant and non-resonant spectra. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The kinetics of H abstraction and addition reactions of 2,4,4-trimethyl-2-pentene by OH were determined by traditional and canonical variational transition state theory, with potential energy surfaces calculated at DLPNO-CCSD(T)/cc-pvtz//BHANDHLYP/6-311G(d, p) and CCSD(T)/6-311++ G(d, p)//BHANDHLYP/6-311G(d, p) level. In addition, tunneling effects were corrected by zero-curvature and small-curvature and the microcanonical multidimensional tunneling methods. Results reveal that allylic H abstraction, with low energy barrier, dominants H abstraction reactions, which undergoes both indirect and direct channels. Moreover, OH addition reactions with submerged barriers exhibit negative temperature dependence. H abstraction reactions are significant above 750 K, while addition reactions are more important below 400 K. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB CoFe2O4 nanostructures have successfully via the auto-combustion sol-gel method. The effects of the calcined temperatures (600, 700 and 800 degrees C) on the structural and magnetic properties of CoFe2O4 were studied by XRD and VSM analysis. Well defined and sharp peaks corresponding to the CoFe2O4 were developed by increasing the calcination temperature in the XRD pattern. The functional groups of as prepared and calcined sample were identified by the FTIR spectra analysis. The VSM measurements showed that the saturation magnetization and coercivity increase with increasing calcination temperature. Significant differences in the magnetic properties of the CoFe2O4 nanoparticles have been observed and these differences seem to result from the calcination temperature of the spinel ferrite nanoparticles.

When small ANPs impact RDX crystal planes, the interaction between RDX and Al at the initial stage does not affect the order of shock-induced anisotropic response of RDX crystal and different thickness of alumina shell on ANPs exhibits different capacity to resist structural deformation. When Al slab with 30 wt% is coated with a 3 nm thickness of alumina, Al slab exhibits inert characteristics and provides high compression condition to enhance decomposition of RDX molecules during the initial impact stage.

The PEG@ MOG-100-Fe was prepared by an ingenious introduction of PEG into the traditional sol-gel prepared MOG-100-Fe. The composite exhibited high heat storage density and thermal stability. The PEG loading content reached up to 92% without any leakage above its melting point. The heat storage density reaches to 152.88 kJ kg (1) and is up to 95.8% of their theoretical value. These novel composite PCMs also exhibited excellent recyclability after 50 thermal cycles. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B. V.

Global minima of the ground and first excited doublet states of the trimer are found and Born-Oppenheimer potential energy surfaces of the Li atom interacting with the LiCs molecule were calculated for these states. The lithium atom is placed at various distances and bond angles from the lithium-caesium dimer. Three-body nonadditive forces of the Li2Cs molecule in the global minimum are investigated.

Both X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy exhibited typical features of the rutile phase of SnO2 nanowires for all samples. The analysis of XPS confirmed the Sb doping effectiveness. In addition, Raman spectra revealed inactive modes (242 and 284 cm (1)) attributed to local structural disorder caused by the incorporation of the dopant into the SnO2 lattice and leading to the breakdown of the Raman selection rules.

AB Using the dispersion-corrected DFT calculations, we explore the potential of utilizing the Si-doped boron nitride nanosheet (Si-BNNS) as a highly active catalyst for the reduction of nitrogen monoxide (NO) in the presence of CO molecule. The charge transfer from the surface to NO and CO plays an important role for the activation of these molecules over Si-BNNS. The results indicate that NO can be easily reduced into N2O through a dimer mechanism with the activation barrier of 0.39 eV. The remaining O atom (O-ads) is then eliminated by an incoming CO molecule with a small activation energy (0.34 eV). (C) 2018 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) as one of the most serious air pollution is harmful to people's health, therefore high- performance gas sensors is critically needed. Here, Cu-modified carbon spheres/reduced graphene oxide (Cu@ CS/RGO) composite have been prepared as NO2 gas sensor material. Carbon sphere in the interlayer of RGO can increase the specific surface area of RGO. Copper nanoparticles decorated on the surface of CS can effectively enhance the adsorption activity of RGO as supplier of free electrons. The experimental results showed that its particular structure improved the gas sensitivity of RGO at different NO2 concentrations at room temperature. (C) 2018 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB Using density functional theory method, we investigate the adsorption properties of NH3 and NO2 molecules on stanene and stanane nanosheets. The adsorption of molecules is explored based on the charge transfer, energetics, energy band gap and average energy gap variation. Moreover, the optimal adsorption sites of NH3 and NO2 molecules are identified on stanene and stanane nanosheets. Besides, the state-of-the-art provides the key features for the development of chemi-resistive nanosensor based on stanene and stanane nanosheets upon adsorption of NH3 and NO2 molecules. Furthermore, the study shows that adsorption of NO2 molecules is more prominent rather than NH3 molecules. (C) 2018 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB Structural morphologies of diblock AB and triblock BAB copolymers (A = poly(N-isopropylacrylamide), B = polystyrene) in aqueous environment have been investigated by dissipative particle dynamics (DPD). In triblock copolymers insoluble PS blocks contract while soluble pNIPAM blocks stay at the periphery forming looped chains as corona. As the temperature is increased there is a continuous morphological transition and micelles form ellipsoidal structures with segregated polymer zones. The phase transition of looped pNIPAM chains occurs at lower temperature than for linear chains and within broader temperature range. It is discussed how the chain topology of pNIPAM affects the phase transition. (C) 2018 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

ID THEOREMS
AB Approximate kinetic energy density functionals (KEDFs) are central to orbital-free density functional theory. Limitations on the spatial derivative dependencies of KEDFs have been claimed from differential virial theorems. We identify a central defect in the argument: the relationships are not true for an arbitrary density but hold only for the minimizing density and corresponding chemical potential. Contrary to the claims therefore, the relationships are not constraints and provide no independent information about the spatial derivative dependencies of approximate KEDFs. A simple argument also shows that validity for arbitrary v-representable densities is not restored by appeal to the density-potential bijection. (C) 2018 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB We identify the nucleation pathway for a liquid droplet of a water- like system. In order to calculate the free energy barrier associated with the droplet formation, we use the recently developed mu VT- S simulation method to unravel the nucleation process. We analyze the interdependence between droplet size, entropy and free energy of nucleation. Three key features emerge: the droplet size increases as entropy decreases during the process, the nucleation free energy increases as supersaturation decreases, and the nucleation free energy increases as T decreases. This method can be readily applied to calculate free energy barriers of activated events with entropy as the reaction coordinate. (C) 2018 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB We study the inter-layer coupling in bulk tin selenide ( SnSe) through density functional theory based calculations. Different approximations for the exchange-correlation functionals and the van der Waals interaction are employed. By performing comparison with graphite, MoS2 and black phosphorus, we analyze the inter-layer coupling from different points of view, including the binding energy, the low frequency inter-layer optical phonons, and the inter-layer charge transfer. We find that, there is a strong charge transfer between layers of SnSe, resulting in the strongest inter-layer coupling. Moreover, the charge transfer renders the inter-layer coupling in SnSe not of van der Waals type. Mechanical exfoliation has been used to fabricate mono-or few-layer graphene, MoS2 and black phosphorus. But, our results show that it may be difficult to apply similar technique to SnSe.

The results show that the Pb dopant in the tunnels of OMS-2 could reduce the average valence states of Mn. The lower energy required for bulk oxygen defects formation in Pb-OMS-2 validates the activation of lattice oxygen by inclusion of tunnel dopant. The inclusion of Pb promotes the catalytic oxidation activity of OMS-2 by reducing the energy required for the surface lattice oxygen migration during the Mars - van Krevelen oxidation process.

AB The electronic nature of sites over Fe-ferrierite zeolite stabilizing active alpha-oxygen is analyzed by the periodic DFT + U approach. It is shown that two antiferromagnetically coupled Fe2+ cations with bridging OH-bonds form a stable bi-nuclear site of the [Fe2+< 2OH > Fe2+] doped FER complex. Frontier orbitals of this complex populated by two electrons with minority spins are localized in the bandgap. As a result, [Fe2+< 2OH > Fe2+] unit acquires the properties of a binuclear Lewis acid dipolarophile for 1,3-dipole N2O. First reaction step of N2O decomposition follows the Huisgen's concept of the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition concept followed by the formation of reactive oxygen species Fe-O. (C) 2018 Elsevier B. V.

AB The reduction of nitrobenzene to aniline has broad applications in chemical and pharmaceutical industries. The high reaction temperatures and pressures and unavoidable hazardous chemicals of current metal catalysts call for more environmentally friendly non-metal catalysts. In this study, the plausibility of silicene as a potential catalyst for nitrobenzene reduction is investigated with a focus on the distinct reaction mechanism based on the density functional theory. The direct reaction pathway was shown to be distinctly different from the Haber mechanism following PhNO2* -> PhNO* -> PhNHO* -> PhNH2O* -> PhNH2 *. The hydroxyl groups remain bound to silicene after aniline is formed and acquire a high activation barrier to remove. (C) 2018 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

TI High serum adiponectin is associated with anemia development in chronic

AB Background: Adiponectin is an adipokine secreted by adipocytes. A low adiponectin level is a significant risk factor of diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. Recent studies have shown that adiponectin is negatively associated with hematopoiesis and predicts the development of anemia in the general population. In chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients, circulating adiponectin level is paradoxically elevated and the role of adiponectin is complex. Therefore, we evaluated the relationship between adiponectin and anemia in these patients.
   Methods: This prospective longitudinal study included 2113 patients from the KNOW-CKD study (KoreaN cohort study for Outcome in patients With CKD), after excluding 125 without data on adiponectin levels. Hemoglobin levels were measured yearly during a mean follow-up period of 23.7 months. Anemia was defined as hemoglobin levels of < 13.0 and 12.0 g/dL for men and women, respectively.
   Results: Mean patient age was 53.6 +/- 12.2 years, and 1289 (61%) were men. The mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 50.4 +/- 30.2 mL min(-1)1.73 m(-2). Serum adiponectin level was inversely associated with body mass index, eGFR, log-transformed C-reactive protein, and positively with Charlson comorbidity index, urine protein to creatinine ratio, and high density lipoprotein cholesterol. In addition, serum adiponectin level was also negatively correlated with hemoglobin level and reticulocyte production index in both men and women. In multivariable linear regression analysis after adjustment of multiple confounders, adiponectin was negatively associated with hemoglobin (men, beta = -0.219, P <.001; women, beta = -0.09, P =.025). Among 1227 patients without anemia at baseline, 307 newly developed anemia during the follow-up period. In multivariable Cox regression analysis after adjustment of confounders, high adiponectin level was significantly associated with an increased risk of incident anemia (per 1 mu g/mL increase, hazard ratio, 1.02; 95% confidence interval 1.01-1.04; P =.001).
   Conclusions: A high serum adiponectin level is independently associated with a low hemoglobin level and predicts the development of anemia in patients with CKD. These findings reveal the potential role of adiponectin in CKD-related anemia.

AB Background: FGF23 proved its value in prognostication of cardiovascular events and mortality among renal patients and general population. Limited data exist whether FGF23 may have any use in prediction of negative outcomes among critically ill patients admitted to intensive care unit (ICU).
   Methods: Single center cohort study performed among patients admitted to ICU. The primary exposure was FGF23 plasma concentration measured within 24 h of ICU admission. The primary outcome was incident Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) and in-hospital mortality during the ICU stay.
   Results: The study enrolled 79 patients admitted to ICU. C-terminal FGF23 (cFGF23) but not intact FGF23 (iFGF23) concentration was significantly elevated in patients, who acquired AKI and non-survivors (p <.001). ROC analysis of cFGF23 yielded an AUC of 0.81 and 0.85 for prediction of incident AKI and death during ICU stay, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed higher odds for AKI (OR 1.80; 95% CI 1.10-2.96) and in-hospital mortality (OR 2.85; 95% CI 1.60-5.06) for one unit increase of log transformed cFGF23.
   Conclusions: cFGF23 measurement may serve as a novel biomarker for incident AKI and death among critically ill patients.

ID INTERLEUKIN-6
AB Background: T-helper (Th)-17 lymphocytes and neutrophils are the main sources of the proinflammatory cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of hidradenitis suppurativa (HS).
   Objectives: This study aims to evaluate the improvement of the inflammatory serum markers (ISM) levels in patients with moderate-to-severe HS who receive adalimumab.
   Methods: Nineteen moderate-to-severe HS patients were prospectively recruited. Each of the patients received 40 mg of adalimumab weekly. The ISM levels and modified Hidradenitis Suppurativa Score (mHSS) scores were assessed at baseline and at week 36. Nineteen healthy volunteers (HC) constituted the control group.
   Results: Before adalimumab treatment, the HS patients showed significantly increased levels of interleukin (IL) 6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-17A, soluble TNF receptor II (sTNF-RII), and C-reactive protein (CRP) as well as an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (all P <.01). At week 36, the circulating levels of IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-17A, soluble TNF receptor I (sTNF-RI), sTNF-RII, and CRP, as well as the ESR (all P <.05), decreased significantly in the HS patients who received adalimumab. The decrease in levels of IL-6 (r = 0.65, P =.003), IL-8 (r = 0.52, P =.024), sTNF-RI (r = 0.55, P =.015), and CRP (r = 0.47, P <.040) and the ESR (r = 0.60, P <.006) were significantly well correlated with clinical improvements according to the mHSS.
   Conclusions: Adalimumab improves the ISM-based systemic inflammatory burden in patients with moderate-to severe HS. IL-6, IL-8, sTNF-RI and CRP and the ESR may serve as novel biomarkers for a therapeutic response.

AB Epidemiological evidence suggests cardioprotective effects of anthocyanin consumption. This study examined the predominant strawberry anthocyanin, pelargonidin-3-0-glucoside (Pg-3-glc), and three of its plasma metabolites (protocatechuic acid [PCA], 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, and phloroglucinaldehyde [PGA]) for effects on the production of selected cytokines by lipopolysaccharide-stimulated THP-1 monocytes and macrophages. Concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 were determined using a cytometric bead array kit. PCA at 0.31, 1.25 and 20 pM and PGA at 5 and 20 pM decreased the concentration of IL-6 in the monocyte cultures, but there were no effects on TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-8 and IL-10 and there were no effects of the other compounds. In the macrophage cultures, PGA at 20 mu M decreased the concentrations of IL-6 and IL-10, but there was no effect on TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta and IL-8 and there were no effects of the other compounds. In conclusion, while the effects of PGA were only observed at the higher, supraphysiological concentration and are thus considered of limited physiological relevance overall, the anti-inflammatory properties of PCA were observed at both the lower, physiologically relevant, and the higher concentrations; however, effects were modest and limited to IL-6 and monocytes. These preliminary data suggest potential for physiologically attainable PCA concentrations to modulate IL-6 production by monocytes.

AB The aim of this research was to assess the relationship between plasma adiponectin, leptin, resistin, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) levels and echocardiographic parameters of ventricular remodeling in patients with coronary artery disease, without acute myocardial infarction. The study population consisted of 49 patients with echocardiographic measurements performed. After adjustment for age, gender, body mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and glycaemia, adiponectin was statistically significant associated with inter ventricular septum thickness (beta = -0.304), left ventricular posterior wall thickness (beta = -0.402), left ventricular end diastolic diameter (LVEDD; beta = 0.385) and left ventricular relative wall thickness (beta = -0.448, p <.05 for all). The associations were no longer significant when only patients without diabetes were included in the analysis. Leptin was associated with LVEDD (beta = -0.354) and left ventricular relative wall thickness (beta = 0.385, p <.05 for all). No associations between resistin, TNF-alpha and echocardiographic left ventricular parameters assessed were found in these patients. In conclusion, in patients with coronary artery disease and without acute myocardial infarction leptin may represent a potential mechanism of adverse cardiac remodeling. Resistin and TNF-alpha might not be involved in ventricular remodeling in these patients.

AB The correlation of interleukin 10 (IL-10) with the outbreak and progression of cancer has been well established as it contributes to tumor immune evasion. Convincing number of evidences has been accumulated to reflect the critical correlation between IL-10 polymorphism and tumorogenesis. Several polymorphic sites at promoter regions have been reported to be associated with cancer susceptibility. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of modulated genotypes in the promoter region of IL-10 gene with life-style habits in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) in the Indian population. A total of 300 subjects (100 OSCC, 50 precancer and 150 healthy controls) were recruited in this study. The IL-10 promoter region was amplified in 14 overlapping fragments by PCR and further screened through the high throughput technique of denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (dHPLC) followed by sequencing. We identified three novel variations at positions (-924, -1045 & -1066); we also found some known SNPs (-592C/A, -657G/A, -851G/A, -819C/T, -1082A/G). The identified novel variations were submitted to the NCBI Gene Bank (accession numbers ICH 53594, KT291742 and KT291743). We also noticed a significant association of polymorphisms (-592C/A, -819C/T and -1082A/G) individually as well as in combination (haplotypes) along with lifestyle habits for the risk of oral carcinoma (p < 0.0001). We have reported three novel SNPs in the Indian population for the first time, and these SNPs may be associated with OSCC. Besides, we showed the first evidence of IL-10 haplotypes, i.e., CCG and CTG, may act as a biomarker for early detection of oral pre-cancerous/cancerous lesions or treatment management of oral carcinoma.

   DEFINITIONS
AB Patients admitted to a medical intensive care unit (ICU) are characterized by an activated immune system and exhibit a high mortality rate irrespective of the underlying cause of admission. Interleukin (IL)-33 has been shown to be protective in experimental sepsis models and it has been demonstrated that circulating levels of its "decoy" receptor soluble ST2 (sST2) are associated with outcome in critically ill patients. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether circulating IL-33 is associated with 30-day mortality in patients admitted to a medical ICU. In this prospective, observational study, both IL-33 and sST2 levels were assessed in 223 consecutive patients at ICU admission using specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). During the 30-day follow-up, 58 patients (26%) died. Circulating IL-33 was detectable in 166 patients and in 57 patients, serum IL-33 was below the detection limit. Both detectable IL-33 and sST2 below the median were strong predictors of survival in critically ill patients independent of acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) score. IL-33 and sST2 predicted risk independent from each other. Patients with both, non-detectable levels of IL-33 and sST2 levels above the median, showed a dramatically increased mortality risk (HR 6.9 95% CI 3.0-16.2; p < 0.001). Low levels of IL-33 and increased levels of sST2 predict mortality risk in critically ill patients independent from each other and APACHE II score. Both together showed additive predictive value suggesting a pathogenic role of the IL-33/ST2 system in critically ill patients.

AB Introduction: PPAR beta/delta agonists are known to modulate the systemic inflammatory response after sepsis. In this study, inflammation modulation effects of PPAR beta/delta are investigated using the selective PPAR beta/delta agonist (GW0742) in a model of haemorrhagic shock (HS)-induced sterile systemic inflammation.
   Methods: Blood pressure-controlled (35 +/- 5 mmHg) HS was performed in C57/BL6 mice for 90 min. Low-dose GW0742 (0.03 mg/kg/BW) and high-dose GW0742 (0.3 mg/kg/BW) were then administered at the beginning of resuscitation. Mice were sacrificed 6 h after induction of HS. Plasma levels of IL-6, IL-1 beta, IL-10, TNF alpha, KC, MCP-1, and GM-CSF were determined by ELISA. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in pulmonary and liver tissues was analysed with standardised MPO kits.
   Results: In mice treated with high-dose GW0742, plasma levels of IL-6, IL-1 beta, and MCP-1 were significantly increased compared to the control group mice. When compared to mice treated with low-dose GW0742 plasma levels of IL-6, IL-1 beta, GM-CSF, KC, and MCP-1 were significantly elevated in high-dose-treated mice. Low-dose GW0742 treatment was associated with a non-significant downtrend of inflammatory factors in mice with HS. No significant changes of MPO activity in lung and liver were observed between the control group and the GW0742 treatment groups.
   Conclusion: This study identified dose-dependent effects of GW0742 on systemic inflammation after HS. While high-dose GW0742 substantially enhanced the systemic inflammatory response, low-dose GW0742 led to a downtrend of pro-inflammation cytokine expression. The exact mechanisms are yet unknown and need to be assessed in further studies.

AB Chronic and aggressive periodontitis are infectious diseases characterized by the irreversible destruction of periodontal tissues, which is mediated by the host inflammatory immune response triggered by periodontal infection. The chemokine receptor CCR5 play an important role in disease pathogenesis, contributing to pro inflammatory response and osteoclastogenesis. CCR5 Delta 32 (rs333) is a loss-of-function mutation in the CCR5 gene, which can potentially modulate the host response and, consequently periodontitis outcome. Thus, we investigated the effect of the CCR5 Delta 32 mutation over the risk to suffer periodontitis in a cohort of Brazilian patients (total N = 699), representative of disease susceptibility (chronic periodontitis, N = 197; and aggressive periodontitis, N-= 91) or resistance (chronic gingivitis, N = 193) phenotypes, and healthy subjects (N = 218). Additionally, we assayed the influence of CCR5 Delta 32 in the expression of the biomarkers TNFa, IL-10, IL-6, IFN-y and T-bet, and key periodontal pathogens P. gingivalis, T. forsythia, and T. denticola. In the association analysis of resistant versus susceptible subjects, CCR5 Delta 32 mutant allele-carriers proved significantly protected against chronic (OR 0.49; 95% CI 0.29-0.83; p-value 0.01) and aggressive (OR 0.46; 95% CI 0.22-0.94; p-value 0.03) periodontitis. Further, heterozygous subjects exhibited significantly decreased expression of TNFa in periodontal tissues, pointing to a functional effect of the mutation in periodontal tissues during the progression of the disease. Conversely, no significant changes were observed in the presence or quantity of the periodontal pathogens P. gingivalis, T. forsythia, and T. denticola in the subgingival biofilm that could be attributable to the mutant genotype.

AB Wrack (stranded phyto-detritus) from terrestrial and marine sources is an important source of carbon and nutrients for many intertidal habitats. In urbanised estuaries, seawalls may act as a barrier to the transport of wrack between terrestrial and marine habitats and, where they reduce the width and habitat complexity of the intertidal zone, negatively impact on wrack accumulation and retention on estuarine shorelines. We assessed differences in the accumulation of wrack between natural (sandy beach, rocky reef and rockpools) and armoured stretches of shoreline, and the efficacy of eco-engineering interventions (man-made rockpools and planted saltmarshes) in enhancing the accumulation and retention of wrack. Surveys conducted at 4 sites in Kogarah Bay, New South Wales, Australia, on 3 dates during autumn-winter 2016 revealed that on natural shorelines most wrack accumulated at the high intertidal mark. Placement of seawalls restricted wrack accumulation to the low intertidal zone, in front of the seawall. The cover of wrack was significantly less in the low intertidal zone in front of seawalls than either the high or low tidal elevations of the natural sandy beaches and rockpools. The man-made rockpools in the low tidal zone had higher cover and biomass of marine and terrestrial wrack than the low intertidal zone of the seawalls, and both these and the planted saltmarshes also supported the accumulation of wrack at the mid intertidal elevation. Experimental deployments of marked seagrass wrack revealed that the eco-engineered habitats enhanced wrack retention over a 7 day period compared with the seawalls. However, the artificial rockpools also retaining more wrack than the equivalent natural habitat. Our results suggest that the structural complexity of eco-engineered habitats can be effective at trapping and retaining wrack, with potential flow-on effects to benthic assemblages through increased food and shelter resources. When designing eco-engineering interventions for modified shorelines, scientists and managers should consider not only their impacts on biodiversity but also on key ecosystem functions.

AB Deyeuxia angustifolia wetlands widely distribute in the Sanjiang Plain in the northeastern China. Owing to land reclamation, these D. angustifolia wetland ecosystems are rapidly shrinking on the landscape, threatening ecosystem functioning and regional ecological security. Converting farmlands to wetlands serves as an ecological engineering widely used for natural restoration in Sangjiang Plain. Vegetation restoration process of restored D. angustifolia wetlands needs to be fully assessed. However, limited information is available for uncovering the impact of restoration time on ecological vegetative characteristics under natural succession. In this study, vegetation survey and sampling were carried out in six restored D. angustifolia wetlands with a chronosequence (2-, 4-, 8-, 13-, 16-, 20-year restoration), as well as the undisturbed D. angustifolia wetland. Plant community composition changed greatly during the past two decades. In the 2-year and 4-year restored wetlands, farmland weeds Artemisia argyi and Calamagrostis brachytricha were the dominant species. Plant communities were gradually dominated by D. angustifolia and Carex spp. with the increase of restoration time. Species diversity in restored wetlands was higher than that in undisturbed wetland and decreased with restoration time increasing. Plant height and coverage increased with the increase of the restoration time, whereas the plant density generally decreased. The plant communities in restored wetlands were increasingly close to that in the undisturbed wetland. The forb, sedge and grass plants accumulated more biomass in 2-year, 8-year and 20-year restored wetlands, respectively. Regression between the grass biomass and species diversity is significantly negative (p <= 0.05). Results in this study suggest that the vegetation of cultivated D. angustifolia wetland could be restored effectively through natural succession, although there were some functional differences between restored and undisturbed D. angustifolia wetlands. Community composition variance and functional traits based on vital attributes can be used to reliably predict changes in diversity of species in response to natural restoration.

Species composition, grassland desertification, and aboveground biomass (AGB) are used as indicators of grassland degradation. In this study, we comprehensively analyzed variations in these three indicators of grassland degradation in semiarid grassland in North China, on multiple time scales. Since 1984, species composition has become simpler and species indicative of grassland degradation, such as Potentilla acaulis and Artemisia frigida, have become dominant. These changes indicate that serious grassland degradation has occurred since 1984. Grassland degradation was also analyzed on shorter time scales. Analyses of interannual variations during 2005-2015 showed that desertification decreased and average AGB in the growing season increased over the study area, indicating that grassland was recovering. However, analyses of species composition indicated that grassland was actually degrading during this period. Analyses of spatial variations showed that the position of slightly desertified grassland shifted and formed a band in the west, where the lowest AGB in the growing season was recorded. Grassland AGB decreased in most parts of the south and east (similar to 20 g/m(2) per decade) but increased in other regions from 2005 to 2015. Climatic factors had critical effects on grassland degradation, showing that simpler species composition mainly resulted from an increase in average temperature and a decrease in average precipitation over the past 30 years. And in recent decade, increased precipitation and decreases both in temperature and potential evapotranspiration relieved desertification and increased AGB overall. This study thus revealed that ecosystem structure degenerated seriously in the long-term, but AGB increased in the short-term mainly due to increases in both indicator species for grassland degradation and species with strong resistance to drought tolerance. Thus, this study suggested there had distinct difference in grassland degradation identified by above three indicators at different time-scales, and multiple perspectives should be considered to accurately assess the state and characteristics of grassland degradation.

AB Clarifying the effects of invasive plant species (IPS) on the taxonomic and functional diversity of native communities provides insight into the mechanisms underlying successful plant invasion. This study aims to determine the effects of an IPS (Solidago canadensis L.) at different invasion degree on the taxonomic and functional diversity of plant communities by using a comparative analysis. The degree of S. canadensis invasion was divided into several categories-uninvaded (0%), low (< 35%), moderate (35%-75%), and heavy (> 75%)-on the basis of the relative abundance of the species in the invaded ecosystems. Forty quadrats (2 m x 2 m) were surveyed per invasion to assess the degree of S. canadensis invasion. The taxonomic diversity of plant communities was calculated using the Shannon-Wiener diversity and Margalef's richness indices. The functional diversity of plant communities was estimated using community-weighted mean trait values, Mason's alpha and beta functional diversity, and Rao's quadratic entropy. The taxonomic diversity indices of plant communities significantly decreased under moderate and heavy degree of S. canadensis invasion conditions. Most of the functional diversity indices of plant communities significantly increased under all degree of S. canadensis invasion conditions (especially under moderate and heavy degree of invasion conditions). The increased functional diversity of plant communities under S. canadensis invasion conditions (especially under moderate and heavy degree of invasion conditions) may lead to a more efficient use of resources at the interspecific level via niche complementarity.

AB A single chamber membrane-less air cathode microbial fuel cell coupled constructed wetland (MFC-CW) was constructed to treat nitrobenzene-containing wastewater and generate electricity simultaneously. Three devices of blank control (CK), microbial fuel cell (MFC) and MFC-CW were investigated. The inherent relationship between substrate degradation and electricity generation were evaluated by the electronic characteristics. The maximum voltage of MFC-CW was obtained at the electrode spacing of 13 cm. The maximum power density of MFC and MFC-CW were 0.59 and 1.53 mW/m(2) respectively. The maximum nitrobenzene removal rate of 92.89% was attained in the MFC-CW when the concentration ratio of nitrobenzene to chemical oxygen demand (COD) was 1:16 with hydraulic retention time at 24 h. The COD removal rate was between 67.92% and 78.30%, and the MFC-CW was efficient for COD degradation.

AB In recent years, large parts of arid and semi-arid areas in the world are dealing with water restrictions. In these areas, wetlands provide habitats for migratory birds and have a critical role in socio-ecological systems. Generally, in these areas, changing water-use patterns because of land-use change and water limitation because of climate change have led to the loss of wide areas of wetlands. Wetland restoration is suggested to restore the functions and values of wetlands that have been destroyed or affected by stresses. In this paper, a new application of wetland restoration prioritizing is introduced; restoration prioritizing to reduce the negative effects of drought. In this method, areas with the highest priority for restoration will be determined in a wetland destroyed because of water limitations. Multicriteria-spatial decision support system (MC-SDSS) was used to plan a scheme for Hamun wetlands restoration prioritizing in order to reduce the negative effects of drought and to restore the wetlands. This prioritization-determined areas that are valuable for Long-term water conservation, reduce the negative effects of dust storms and conserve water bird's habitats. This method was used in a wetland that is the only water resource in the middle of a wide arid plain. Because of water limitation, it is not possible to restore the hole wetland; therefore, different parts of this wetland were prioritized for restoration. Based on the results, it is possible to produce a model to determine which priority can be restored in each amount of water volume. In this way, it becomes clear for decision-makers to select areas for restoration in different volumes of water. The result of this study shows that since MC-SDSS decreases conflicts between alternatives in a decision-making process and uses their spatial situation, it is a preferred method to balance among conflicting goals. Furthermore, because spatial data are the most important parts of MC-SDSS, this paper shows the ability of remote sensing to be used in MC-SDSS method. It seems that in the future; remote sensing will have the most important role in MC-SDSS.

TI Evaluating the net value of ecosystem services to support ecological

   afforestation project
SO ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING

ID CONSERVATION; CHINA
AB Ecological services were initially used to quantify the benefits used in valuation of environmental protection, as they helped stakeholders to understand the benefits that ecosystems bring to people. As a result, they increased support for ecological engineering, including ecosystem restoration. However, by failing to account for costs, and particularly for indirect costs such as the tradeoffs among ecosystem services under different land uses, the analyses were incomplete and often provided poor support for policy development and land management to promote environmental conservation. In this paper, we provide a framework for assessing the net value of the benefits provided by ecosystem services (i.e., the benefit that remains after subtracting key costs), taking the Beijing Plains afforestation project as an example. Furthermore, we analyzed the importance of scale effects and marginal changes in ecosystem services assessment, and highlighted the uncertainty of evaluation results caused by basing some of the analysis on market prices, which can change unpredictably. To better support conservation activities and maximize the ecological benefits obtained from an environmental strategy, it's necessary to obtain accurate estimates of the net value of ecosystem services by accounting for an increasing range of direct and indirect costs, calculated at the same scale as the project implementation and accounting for marginal changes, thereby providing better support for policy development and implementation.

AB Objectives: Self-administration of subcutaneous depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA-sc) is feasible, acceptable, and effective. Our objective was to compare one-year continuation of DMPA-sc between women randomized to self-administration versus clinic administration.
   Study design: We randomized 401 females ages 15-44 requesting DMPA at clinics in Texas and New Jersey to self-administration or clinic administration in a 1:1 allocation. Clinic staff taught participants randomized to self-administration to self-inject and observed the first injection; participants received instructions, a sharps container, and three doses for home use. Participants randomized to clinic administration received usual care. All participants received DMPA-sc at no cost and injection reminders via text message or email. We conducted follow-up surveys at six and 12 months.
   Results: Three hundred thirty-six participants (84%) completed the 12-month survey; 316 completed both follow-up surveys (an 80% response rate excluding eight withdrawals). Participants ranged in age from 16-44. One-year DMPA continuous use was 69% in the self administration group and 54% in the clinic group (p=.005). There were three self-reported pregnancies during the study period, all occurred in the clinic group; all three women had discontinued DMPA and one reported her pregnancy as intended.
   Among the self-administration group, 97% reported that self-administration was very or somewhat easy; 87% would recommend self-administration of DMPA-sc to a friend. Among the clinic group, 52% reported interest in self-administration in the future. Satisfaction was similar between groups. No serious adverse events were reported.
   Conclusions: DMPA self-administration improves contraceptive continuation and is a feasible and acceptable option for women and adolescents. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To assess the contraceptive performance of the 52-mg 20 mu g/day levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS, Mirena; Bayer Oy, Turku, Finland) among women who maintain the same device without changes after 60 months.
   Study design: This is a chart review study in which we assessed the charts of 766 women who continue the same LNG-IUS for contraception beyond 60 months. The women were evaluated at the Family Planning clinic, University of Campinas Medical School, Campinas, SP, Brazil, from November 1990 to March 2011. We obtained sociodemographic data, duration of use, continuation and discontinuation rates and reasons, bleeding pattern at the recorded last visit. The statistical analysis was performed using Kaplan Meier analysis.
   Results: A total of 776 charts were identified of women who used the LNG-IUS beyond 60 months. The mean age (+/- S.E.M.) at LNG-IUS placement was 32.0 +/- 0.2 years (ranged 15 to 44 years; median was 32 years). The distribution of number of pregnancies was 0-1 (45%); 2-4 (54.1%) and >= 5 (0.9%). The median length of the LNG-IUS' use was 73 months after placement (ranged 61-184 months). Zero pregnancies were reported and the main reasons for discontinuation were expiration of approved effective lifespan, menopause and planning pregnancy. The cumulative women-years (W-Y) of exposure were 967 and 1403 up to seven and 15 years, respectively. The main bleeding pattern reported by the women was amenorrhea.
   Conclusions: The 52-mg 20 mu g/day LNG-IUD (Mirena) showed continue contraceptive efficacy beyond 5 years of use with no pregnancies detected over 967 and 1403 W-Y up to seven and 15 years after placement.
   Implications statement: The 52-mg 20 mu g/day LNG-IUD presented a very high contraceptive efficacy beyond the first 5 years of lifetime labeled. Increasing data support that efficacy beyond 5 years of use, and new data suggested efficacy as long as 15 years. Healthcare professionals, policy makers and stakeholders could take advantage of the present information to decide to maintain the same device at least up to seven years. Furthermore, amenorrhea could be a good indicator of contraceptive effect. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID RANDOMIZED-CONTROLLED-TRIAL; WOMEN
AB Objective: The objective was to evaluate amenorrhea patterns and predictors of amenorrhea during the first year after levonorgestrel 52 mg intrauterine system (IUS) placement.
   Study design: This cohort analysis includes 1714 nulliparous and parous women who received a Liletta (R) levonorgestrel 52 mg IUS in a multicenter trial to evaluate efficacy and safety for up to 8 years. Participants maintained a daily diary with bleeding information. We assessed bleeding patterns in 90-day intervals; amenorrhea was defined as no bleeding or spotting in the preceding 90 days. We employed multivariable regression to identify predictors of amenorrhea at 12 months. The predictor analysis only included women not using a levonorgestrel IUS in the month prior to study enrollment.
   Results: In the month before enrollment, 148 and 1566 women, respectively, had used and not used a levonorgestrel IUS. Prior users averaged 50 +/- 19 months of use before IUS placement; 38.4% of these women reported amenorrhea at 12 months. Amenorrhea rates for non-prior-users at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months were 0.2%, 9.1%, 17.2% and 16.9%, respectively. During the first 12 months, 29 (1.7%) women discontinued for bleeding irregularities; no women discontinued for amenorrhea. The only significant predictor of amenorrhea at 12 months was self-reported baseline duration of menstrual flow of fewer than 7 days vs. 7 or more days (18.2% vs. 5.2%, adjusted odds ratio 3.70 [1.69, 8.07]). We found no relationships between 12-month amenorrhea rates and age, parity, race, body mass index, baseline flow intensity or hormonal contraception use immediately prior to IUS placement.
   Conclusions: Amenorrhea rates during the first year of levonorgestrel 52 mg IUS use are similar at 9 and 12 months. Amenorrhea at 12 months is most common among women with shorter baseline duration of menstrual flow.
   Implications statement: This information provides more data for clinicians when counseling women about amenorrhea expectations, especially since women seeking a levonorgestrel 52 mg IUS for contraception are different than women desiring treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding. Amenorrhea at 12 months is most common among women with shorter baseline duration of menstrual flow. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID INSERTION; DELIVERY
AB Objectives: We sought to evaluate the 6-week clinical outcomes (intrauterine device [IUD] retention, recognized expulsions, ability to visualize or palpate strings, and need for ultrasound evaluation) in women who received a TCu380A postplacental IUD (PPIUD) after vaginal (VD) or cesarean delivery (CD).
   Study design: We conducted a retrospective cohort study to examine the 6-week retention of TCu380A IUDs placed within 10 min of placental delivery in VD (n=137) and CD (n=73). We used Student's t test and Wilcoxon rank sum tests for continuous data and Pearson chi(2) test and Fisher's Exact Test for categorical data.
   Results: Of the 169 women who had follow-up, 151 (89.3%) retained their IUD at 6 weeks (95% CI 84.7%-93.9%). All women who underwent CD retained their IUD at 6 weeks postpartum (56/56), whereas 95/113 (84% [95% CI 76.0%-90.3%]) who underwent VD retained their original IUD (p<.01). Strings were detected more frequently in women who had a VD (93.1% [95% CI 85.6-97.4]) compared to those who delivered by CD (44.2% [95% CI 30.5-58.7]; p<.01). Women who underwent CD had an ultrasound to evaluate IUD location more frequently (42.9% [95% CI 29.7-56.8]) compared to women who underwent VD (13.7% [95% CI 7.5-22.3]; p<.01).
   Conclusion: Women are more likely to retain a PPIUD after CD compared to a VD (p<.01); however, women who have a PPIUD placed after CD are more likely to have nonvisible strings with a pelvic exam (p<.01) and undergo pelvic ultrasound evaluation (p<.01) compared to a PPIUD placed at the time of a VD.

AB Objective: To describe women's pain and experiences with immediate postpartum intrauterine device (IUD) insertion (IPPI) following vaginal delivery using a ring forceps insertion technique.
   Study design: This observational mixed-methods study included women who underwent successful IPPI using ring forceps, with and without epidural analgesia. To describe women's pain during the procedure, we recruited women during antenatal care and at the time of admission for delivery until we collected at least 30 sets of pain scores at two time points (preprocedure and immediately postprocedure) in both groups using two instruments: 100-mm visual analogue scale (VAS) and a 4-point Likert verbal rating scale (VRS) (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe). After placing the IUD, physicians rated ease of IUD insertion. A subset of participants in both groups underwent semistructured interviews prior to hospital discharge. Our goal was to explore women's (a) decisional influences and prior contraception experience, (b) experience during IPPI and (c) decisional regret. We conducted iterative analysis of interview content until thematic saturation was reached in both groups. Interviewees provided recall pain scores and rated satisfaction with IPPI.
   Results: We collected 30 pain scores in the no-epidural group and 36 in the epidural group. At both time points, the VAS data exhibited very low pain scores in the epidural group and a uniform distribution in the no-epidural group; standard deviations were large. The majority of women in both groups reported "none mild" pain on the VRS. Physicians reported minimal difficulty with IUD insertion in most cases. We conducted interviews with 12 women who had an epidural and 9 who did not. Both groups offered similar comments across all domains. Convenience was the primary motivation to undergo IPPI, and women recognized the barriers to obtaining effective contraception remote from delivery. The majority of interviewees, even those with high pain scores, characterized their procedural pain as less than expected, and IUD insertion pain was less than or similar to labor pain. Interviewees' recall pain scores were similar to those reported at the time of IUD insertion. An unanticipated theme that emerged was an ineffective informed consent process; women could not recall most procedural risks or how IPPI was accomplished. All interviewees endorsed IPPI, expressing a high degree of satisfaction; none regretted undergoing the procedure.
   Conclusion: The distributions of our VAS scores did not reveal useful summary statistics in either group. The VRS scores were a more informative representation of women's pain during IPPI; most women reported little pain. Convenience of obtaining highly effective contraception immediately postpartum was the key motivator for undergoing IPPI. All women voiced favorable experiences, even those who had high pain scores.

AB Objective: The objective was to characterize uptake and correlates of effective contraceptive use postpartum.
   Study design: We analyzed data from a national, cross-sectional evaluation of prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission programs that enrolled women attending 6-week or 9-month infant immunization visits at 120 Kenyan maternal and child health clinics. We classified women who resumed sexual activity postpartum and did not desire a child within 2 years as having a need for family planning (FP).
   Results: We included 955 (94%) of 1012 women 8-10 months postpartum in the analysis. Mean age was 25.8 years and 36% were primigravidas. By 9 months postpartum, 62% of all women used contraception and 59% used effective contraception [injectables, implants, intrauterine devices [IUDs], oral contraceptives [OCs] and tubal ligations]. Most contraceptive users (61%) used injectables, followed by implants (10%), OCs (6%), IUDs (4%) and condoms alone (2%). The majority (n=733, 77%) had a need for FP, and 67% of 733 women with FP need used effective contraception. Among women with a need for FP, effective contraception use was higher among those who discussed FP in postnatal care (PNC) than who did not discuss FP in PNC [prevalence ratio (PR) for PNC alone: 1.35, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.16-1.58; PR for PNC and antenatal care (ANC): 1.42, 95% CI: 1.21-1.67; p=.001 for both].
   Conclusions: Two thirds of postpartum women with a need for FP used effective contraception at 9 months postpartum, and use was associated with discussing FP during PNC. Published by Elsevier Inc.

DT Article
DE Anemia; Demographic and Health Survey; Oral contraceptives; Low- and
   middle-income countries
ID IRON-DEFICIENCY; WOMEN; RISK; ENDOMETRIUM; BENEFITS
AB Context: In low- and middle-income countries, anemia is a major public health issue in women of reproductive age for a series of factors including iron deficiency.
   Objective: To estimate prevalence of anemia and to assess the association of low level of hemoglobin versus duration of use of oral contraceptives (OC).
   Methods: Demographic and Health Surveys of 12 countries, conducted between 2005 and 2012, were analyzed. The status of anemia was separately evaluated for nonpregnant women using OC for at least 6 months, 1 year and 2 years, and for women using no method of contraception and/or using nonhormonal contraception.
   Results: The total study population comprised 201,720 women, with 40% diagnosed with anemia; around 1 out of 25 women was using oral contraception.
   The current and continuous use of oral contraception was of benefit against anemia, with the risk for anemia decreasing from odds ratio (OR) 0.68 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.64-0.73] for use of at least 6 months to OR 0.56 (95% CI 0.52-0.61) for use of at least 1 year and to OR 0.50 (95% CI 0.46-0.54) for use of at least 2 years.
   Conclusions: Findings reinforce evidence of the noncontraceptive benefit of long-term use of OC and provide valuable information for policy makers, family planning staff and clinicians working in low- and middle-income countries in efforts to control anemia.

DE Decision making; Contraception; Young women; Decision support
ID UNITED-STATES; SUPPORT TOOL; PATIENT; PERCEPTIONS; AIDS
AB Objective: Assisting women with choosing contraceptive methods that meet their needs and preferences is essential to providing patient-centered care, but research to inform interventions supporting method choice is lacking. An assessment of patient decisional needs for contraceptive method choice may provide insight into patient-centered ways to support decision making.
   Study design: Using the Ottawa Decision Support Framework as a guide, we conducted a qualitative study with semistructured interviews to identify women's decisional needs for choosing a contraceptive method. The sample consisted of 21 women aged 18-29 from an integrated health care delivery system. We employed thematic analysis to identify common themes in the participants' experience.
   Results: Overall, participants perceived choosing a contraceptive method to be a somewhat difficult decision and described feeling hesitant and unsure. Lack of knowledge of and familiarity with methods and the unpredictability of side effects contributed to participants' hesitancy. Women considered method choice in the context of their lives and their values for various contraceptive attributes, particularly side effects. Participants identified several sources for contraceptive information. Information from friends and family was highly influential. Participants desired both factual and experiential information.
   Conclusions: Contraceptive method choice may be difficult for many young women, suggesting a need for decision support. Interventions supporting method choice may be more relevant if they directly address knowledge gaps and uncertainty as well as provide both factual and experiential information on a comprehensive set of contraceptive attributes.

AB Objectives: To examine adolescent attitudes toward accessing contraception through a new pharmacist prescribing model in the State of California.
   Study design: In-depth telephone interviews were conducted in summer 2015 with 30 females ages 18 to 19 in California. Participants were recruited using a social media advertisement. Semi-structured interviews utilized open-ended questions to understand teens' experiences with pharmacies, experiences obtaining contraception, and views on pharmacist prescribing of contraception. Responses were transcribed and qualitatively analyzed using an independent-coder method to identify salient themes.
   Results: Participants were ethnically diverse and primarily living in suburban areas. All participants had completed high school and many had completed one year of college. Nearly all participants were supportive of California's new law allowing pharmacist prescribing of contraception. Thematic analyses revealed that while participants were satisfied with traditional service providers and valued those relationships, they appreciated the benefit of increased access and convenience of going directly to a pharmacy. Participants expected increased access to contraception in pharmacies would lead to both personal and societal benefits. They expressed concerns regarding parental involvement, as well as confidentiality in the pharmacy environment and with insurance disclosures.
   Conclusion: Older teens in California are very supportive of pharmacies and pharmacists as direct access points for contraception, but confidentiality concerns were noted. Policy makers and pharmacies can incorporate study findings when designing policies, services, and physical pharmacy spaces to better serve teens. Further research is warranted after pharmacies implement this new service to assess teen utilization and satisfaction as well as outcomes.
   Implication statement: Several states recently passed legislation enabling pharmacists to prescribe contraception and other states are considering similar legislation. Older teens are interested in this additional method of contraceptive access and understanding their perspectives can help guide implementation by states and in individual pharmacies.

TI Women's perceptions and treatment, patterns related to contraception:
   results of a survey of US women
SO CONTRACEPTION
LA English
DT Article
DE Oral contraceptives; Intrauterine device; Patient preferences; United
   States
ID UNITED-STATES; CHOICE
AB Objectives: The aim of this survey was to understand US women's contraception journey from her first prescribed method to her current one including reasons for choosing and stopping/switching methods, healthcare provider relationships, and bleeding preferences.
   Study design: We administered a nationally-representative, web-based survey of US women aged 16 to 50 years currently using (N=1656) or had previously used (N=1448) prescription contraception, or who had never used it but would consider using it in the future (N=103). Statistical analyses were based on overlap formulae with sample weights adjusted to 2010 US census demographic benchmarks.
   Results: The survey was sent to 11,906 women, and 5957 responded (50% response rate). Among qualified respondents, 3104 had experience with prescription contraception. Oral contraceptives (OC) remain the most frequently prescribed method as first or subsequent contraception. However, as women switch to their current prescription method, more chose IUD contraception. As reported by respondents, only 48% of current users received counseling on how to use specific methods, and 58% were counseled on bleeding patterns to expect, while 67% were offered counseling on potential side effects. Many of the side effects reported in this study for first and current prescription contraception were nonspecific and may be related to a nocebo effect, lack of understanding about normal bodily fluctuations, or poor compliance. Many women (34%) reported 'making their periods lighter' as a reason for using their current prescription method, and 53% would prefer to skip their monthly period altogether.
   Conclusions: Misperceptions about contraception are common, and prescription contraception choice can be quite complex. Clinicians can enhance patient satisfaction by providing adequate information and matching methods to women's lifestyles, reproductive choices, and pregnancy risk.
   Implications: This study provides insight into modern women's attitudes and views toward prescription contraception that may be important to clinicians and women themselves. (C) 2017 The Authors.

TI Pharmacy access to Ulipristal acetate in major cities throughout the
   United States
SO CONTRACEPTION
LA English
DT Article
DE Emergency contraception; Ulipristal acetate; Pharmacy availability;
   Contraceptive access
ID EMERGENCY CONTRACEPTION; LEVONORGESTREL
AB Objective: Ulipristal acetate (UPA) is a prescription emergency contraceptive pill (ECP). Despite the potential for UPA to reduce the risk of unintended pregnancies, a recent study in Hawaii demonstrated less than 3% of pharmacies stocked UPA and less than 23% reported the ability to order it. The primary outcome of our study was to assess the availability of UPA in a sample of large cities nationwide.
   Study design: We conducted a telephone-based secret shopper study of 533 retail pharmacies sampled proportionally from 10 large cities in five geographic regions across the US. Callers represented themselves as uninsured 18-year-old women attempting to fill prescriptions for UPA between February and May 2016. Using a semi-structured questionnaire, callers inquired regarding availability and use of UPA.
   Results: Less than 10% (33/344; 95% CI: 6.5-12.7%) of pharmacies indicated the ability to immediately fill a UPA prescription, while 72% (224/311; 95% CI: 65.0-77.0%) of pharmacies without immediate availability reported the ability to order UPA, with the median predicted wait time of 24 h (IQR: 21.5 to 26.0 h).
   Conclusion: Despite evidence for increased efficacy of UPA over levonorgestrel (LNG) ECPs, the availability of UPA in a sample of US major cities is extremely limited. Given that ECPs should be taken as soon as possible after unprotected sex, the long wait times when ordering UPA present an access barrier. Efforts to improve the availability of UPA are important to optimize the potential of ECPs to decrease unintended pregnancy following unprotected sex.
   Implications: Interventions are needed to address barriers to obtaining UPA from retail pharmacies nationwide. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Effects of concurrent vaginal miconazole treatment on the absorption and

   delivered from a contraceptive vaginal ring: a randomized, crossover
   drug-drug interaction study
SO CONTRACEPTION
LA English
DT Article
DE Miconazole; Antifungal; Contraceptive vaginal ring; Nestorone (NES);
   Ethinyl estradiol (EE); Systemic exposure
AB Objectives: To evaluate the effects of concurrent administration of three vaginal miconazole nitrate formulations on the absorption and exposure of Nestorone (R) (segesterone acetate) and ethinyl estradiol from a novel contraceptive vaginal ring (NES/EE CVR).
   Study design: This was an open-label, randomized, crossover, drug drug interaction study conducted over three menstrual cycles in healthy women with regular menses. We compared systemic exposure to NES and EE by determining area under the curve (AUC(8-21d)) with CVR only and CVR with each miconazole treatment. Three different miconazole formulations (single-dose suppository, multiple-dose suppository or multiple-dose cream) were administered in a single dose on day 8 or multiple doses on days 8-10 after CVR insertion. We evaluated safety and tolerability of the CVR in the presence of antimycotic comedication.
   Results: Forty-five participants were randomized, and 29 completed participation. Systemic exposure to NES and EE released from the CVR increased with single or multiple doses of miconazole suppositories but not with multiple-dose cream. The maximum EE geometric mean ratio (GMR) for AUC(8-21d) was 1.67 (1.51-1.86) for single-dose and 1.42 (1.21-1.66) for multiple-dose suppositories. By contrast, systemic exposure to NES and EE was comparable with and without miconazole cream (all GMRs and confidence intervals within 0.80 to 1.25). Adverse events (AEs) were similar with CVR only and with all miconazole treatment groups. There were no serious treatment-related AEs.
   Conclusions: Miconazole vaginal suppositories were associated with increased systemic levels of NES and EE, while systemic exposure with miconazole vaginal cream was comparable to no miconazole exposure.
   Implications: Coadministration of miconazole suppositories with the investigational NES/EE CVR led to higher systemic exposure of both hormones, while coadministration with miconazole cream did not affect hormone levels. Women utilizing the NES/EE CVR may be advised to use an oral formulation or miconazole cream rather than suppository to treat vaginal candidiasis. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: High rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and unintended pregnancy suggest a role for multipurpose prevention technologies (MPTs) designed to combine contraception and infection prophylaxis into one unified method. This study aims to determine factors associated with interest in MPTs among US women.
   Study Design: We administered a national cross-sectional survey via MTurk. Eligibility criteria included female gender, age 18-29 years, residence in the USA, and sexual activity with a male partner in the past three months. In total, 835 surveys were suitable for analysis. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regressions were performed to determine factors associated with interest in MPTs.
   Results: Eighty-three percent of women were interested in MPTs. Factors associated with interest included oral sex in the past three months (aOR 1.87, 95% CI 1.07, 3.53), recent use of oral contraceptive pills (OCPs; aOR 1.78, 95% CI 1.08, 2.93), HIV test within one year (aOR 2.10, 95% CI 1.29, 3.40), and increased STI worry score (aOR 1.98, 95% CI 1.36, 2.86). No use of contraception in the past three months was associated with decreased interest in MPTs (aOR 0.31, 95% Cl 0.17, 0.58). HIV risk factors including race were not associated with MPT interest.
   Conclusion: Our data show that young, sexually active, US women are interested in MPTs. Women who used contraception, specifically OCPs, or evidenced concern for infection were most likely to be interested in such a product. Women reporting unsafe sexual habits were less likely to be interested, highlighting the importance of HIV/STI prevention education.
   Implications: Women in the USA are interested in multipurpose prevention technologies, particularly those women who currently use contraception or are concerned about their risk of infection. Our results emphasize the importance of moving forward with MPT development as well as continued HIV/STI prevention education. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Optimized structural parameters of Albendazole and corresponding vibrational assignments have been studied using infrared and Raman spectroscopy combined with quantum- chemical calculations. Results of these spectroscopic studies have been successfully compared against obtained experimental data. Difference between experimental and calculated CH3 group wavenumbers was blue- shifted by 58 cm (1) and 43 cm (1), respectively due to electronic effects. In NBO analysis the increase in energies and the shortening of C-N and C = O bonds gives clear evidence that the resonance of the benzimidazole ring is increased by the groups. Best binding score of Albendazole was obtained with protein 4NQ6 (- 5. 58 kcal/mol). (C) 2018 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB To obtain a more efficient (N, S) co-doping scheme, we systematically analyze the geometrical parameters, density of states, charge densities, relative dielectric functions and UV-Vis absorption spectra for pure, N/S substitution/interstitial doped and (N, S) substitution/interstitial co-doped TiO2 by using density functional calculations. Compared with (N, S) substitution co-doping, (N, S) interstitial co-doping TiO2 exhibits a more obvious red-shift of absorption edge, because of the band gap is further reduced. Furthermore, there are shallow impurity levels coupling with the top of valence band. The calculated UV-Vis absorption spectra illustrate that (N, S) interstitial co-doping TiO2 has much higher photocatalytic activity in the visible light region. (C) 2018 Elsevier B. V.

AB It is shown that the electrical current that may be obtained from a nanoscale electrochemical system is sensitive to the dimensionality of the electrode and the density of states (DOS). Considering the DOS of lower dimensional systems, such as two-dimensional graphene, one-dimensional nanotubes, or zero-dimensional quantum dots, yields a distinct variation of the current-voltage characteristics. Such aspects go beyond conventional Arrhenius theory based kinetics which are often used in experimental interpretation. The obtained insights may be adapted to other devices, such as solid-state batteries. It is also indicated that electron transport in such devices may be considered through electron tunneling.

AB The metal-semiconductor phase transition of vanadium dioxide VO2 is difficult to describe with conventional density-functional theory methods. In the present study we systematically varied the Fock exchange contribution in hybrid functionals in order to obtain a functional that can accurately describe the structural, electronic and energetic properties of both VO2-phases. For this purpose the hybrid functionals PBE0, HSE06 and LC-omega PBE, that are all derived from the GGA functional PBE, have been tested. Best results for the fundamental band gap and the relative phase stability of the re-parameterized functionals were obtained for 10% Fock exchange in PBE0, 20% Fock exchange in LC-omega PBE and 12.5% Fock exchange in HSE06. The re-parameterized functionals were furthermore tested in terms of their accuracy for calculated structural parameters. It was observed that PBE0-10 and HSE06-12.5 give the overall most accurate results. (C) 2018 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB Nano-SiO2 particles and MWCNTs were used to reinforce the EPs. The mechanical properties of the composites and the strengthening mechanisms of nano-SiO2 and MWCNTs on the mechanical properties of epoxy composites were studied. The results show that the mechanical properties of the reinforced epoxy composites are greatly improved. Especially, nano-SiO2/MWCNTs/EP composites exhibit the most excellent mechanical properties. The synergistic strengthening mechanisms of nano-SiO2 and MWCNTs on the EP are the micro plastic deformation effect, micro-cracks and their divarication effect, and the pull-out effect of MWCNTs in EP matrix, which can reduce the extent of stress concentration and absorb more energy.

AB In recent years, the discovery of suitable catalyst to oxidation of the cyanide (CN) has high importance in the industry. In present study, in the first step, the carbon nanotube (CNT) with the Ge atom embedded and the surface of Ge-CNT via the O-2 molecule activated. In second step, the oxidation of CN on surface of the Ge-CNT via the Langmuir Hinshelwood (LH) and the Eley Rideal (ER) mechanisms was investigated. Results show that O-2-Ge-CNT oxidized the CN molecule via the Ge-CNT-O-O* + CN -> Ge-CNT-O-O* CN -> Ge-CNT-O* + OCN and the Ge-CNT-O* + CN -> Ge-CNT + OCN reactions. Results show that oxidation of CN on surface of Ge-CNT via the LH mechanism has lower energy barrier than ER mechanism. Finally, calculated parameters reveal that Ge-CNT is acceptable catalyst with high performance for CN oxidation, form theoretical point of view. (C) 2018 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) and i-Indigo (i-Ind) are two monomers that are widely explored as active materials in organic field effect transistor and solar cells. These two molecules showed impressive charge carrier mobility due to better packing that are facilitated by quadrupoles. We hypothesized that the copolymers of these monomers would also exhibit high charge carrier mobility. However, we envisioned that the dihedral angle at the connecting point between the monomers will play a crucial role in packing as well as charge transport. To understand the impact of dihedral angle on charge transport, we synthesized three copolymers, wherein the DPP was sandwiched between benzenes, thiophenes and furans. The copolymer of i-Indigo and furan comprising DPP showed a band gap of 1.4 eV with a very high dihedral angle of 179 degrees. The polymer was found to pack better and the coherence length was found to be 112 angstrom. The hole carrier mobility of these polymer was found to be highest among the synthesized polymer i. e. 0.01 cm(2)/vs. The copolymer comprising benzene did not transport hole and electrons. The dihedral angle at the connecting point between i and Indigo and benzene DPP was 143 angstrom, which the packing and consequently charge transport properties. (C) 2018 Elsevier B. V.

AB 7-Nicotinoyl-styrylquinoline (MB96) displays an antiviral activity on HIV-1 infected CEM cell lines and is a promising inhibitor of the serine/threonine-protein Pim-1 kinase. By means of UV-vis spectroscopy supported by theoretical calculations this styrylquinoline is shown to exist in different conformations: the s-trans planar conformation along with other twisted ones with respect to the torsion around the single bond between the quinoline and the phenylethenyl appendage. Hydrogen bonding interactions with the solvent shift the skeleton of the MB96 towards the planar form, enhancing conjugation of pi-electrons between the quinoline and the catechol parts, while self-association process seems furthering this planar conformation.

AB Relativistic effective atomic configurations of superheavy elements Cn, Nh and Fl and their lighter homologues (Hg, Tl and Pb) in their simple compounds with fluorine and oxygen are determined using the analysis of local properties of molecular Kohn- Sham density matrices in the vicinity of heavy nuclei. The difference in populations of atomic spinors with the same orbital angular momentum and different total angular momenta is demonstrated to be essential for understanding the peculiarities of chemical bonding in superheavy element compounds. The results are fully compatible with those obtained by the relativistic iterative version of conventional projection analysis of global density matrices. (C) 2018 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

None of the computational methods could distinguish all the ligands based on their calculated binding free energies (as compared to experimental values). The difference between the two comes from both polar and non-polar part of solvation.

AB In this Letter we report on the first characterization of the reactions SiH + S and SiH + S-2 by means of electronic structure calculations of the stationary points along the reactive potential energy surfaces. According to our calculations, both reactions are barrierless and can lead to the formation of SiS (a species observed in interstellar objects) for which there are no convincing formation routes in current astro-chemical models. Furthermore, we have verified that SiS2 cannot be considered an interstellar reservoir of sulphur because it is easily attacked by the abundant H atoms. (C) 2018 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

It is observed experimentally that the intensity of backscattered photons increases initially with increasing the thickness of the target and then it becomes saturated above a certain thickness. By knowing the saturated thickness values for known atomic number of the elemental targets, the Z(eff) of composite materials has been determined. The experimentally measured Z(eff) values have been compared with theoretical values predicted by direct method, power law method and AutoZ(eff) code. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B. V.

AB Wetting and evaporation characteristics of sessile nanofluid nanodroplet (SNFND) were investigated by molecular dynamics simulation. Results show that for lyophilic surface, with the increase of nanoparticle energy coefficient, contact angle of SNFND increases and total evaporation decreases. Effects of nanoparticle volume percentage on the wetting and evaporation behaviors of SNFND are related to surface wettability. For lyophilic surface, the greater the nanoparticle volume percentage, the greater the contact angle, and the slower the evaporation. For neutral and lyophobic surfaces, nanoparticle volume percentage has obviously strengthening effect on evaporation, and the strengthening effect decreases as nanoparticle volume percentage increases.

ID HALF-METALLICITY; FULLERENE; GAS
AB The energy gap and dipole moment of chemically functionalized graphene quantum dots are investigated by density functional theory. The energy gap can be tuned through edge passivation by different elements or groups. Edge passivation by oxygen considerably decreases the energy gap in hexagonal nanodots. Edge states in triangular quantum dots can also be manipulated by passivation with fluorine. The dipole moment depends on: (a) shape and edge termination of the quantum dot, (b) attached group, and (c) position to which the groups are attached. Depending on the position of attached groups, the total dipole can be increased, decreased, or eliminated. (C) 2018 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB Ghosh, Berkowitz and Parr designed a thermodynamical transcription of the ground-state density functional theory and introduced a local temperature that varies from point to point. The theory, however, is not unique because the kinetic energy density is not uniquely defined. Here we derive the expression of the phase-space Fisher information in the GBP theory taking the inverse temperature as the Fisher parameter. It is proved that this Fisher information takes its minimum for the case of constant temperature. This result is consistent with the recently proven theorem that the phase-space Shannon information entropy attains its maximum at constant temperature. (C) 2018 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB Ubiquinone is the key electron and proton transfer agent in biology. Its mechanism involves the formation of its intermediate one-electron reduced form, the ubisemiquinone radical. This is formed in a protein-bound form which permits the semiquinone to vary its electronic and redox properties. This can be achieved by hydrogen bonding acceptance by one or both oxygen atoms or as we now propose by restricted orientations for the methoxy groups of the headgroup. We show how the orientation of the two methoxy groups of the quinone headgroup affects the electronic structure of the semiquinone form and demonstrate a large dependence of the ubisemiquinone spin density distribution on the orientation each methoxy group takes with respect to the headgroup ring plane. This is shown to significantly modify associated hyperfine couplings which in turn needs to be accounted for in interpreting experimental values in vivo. The study uncovers the key potential role the methoxy group orientation can play in controlling the electronic structure and spin density of ubisemiquinone and provides an electronic-level insight into the variation in electron affinity and redox potential of ubiquinone as a function of the methoxy orientation. Taken together with the already known influence of cofactor conformation on heme and chlorophyll electronic structure, it reveals a more widespread role for cofactor conformational control of electronic structure and associated electron transfer in biology.

AB Photoluminescence and phosphorescence emissions of solid-state phenazine films were investigated in steady-state experimental conditions. Important discrepancies were observed for blended films where a host optically inert matrix was introduced to disperse the probe molecules. A vibronic spin-orbit phosphorescent emission clearly appeared, while for the films solely composed by the probe molecules, the phosphorescence broadened and presented a structureless shape, shifted to longer wavelengths. Further Arrhenius behavior analysis on the photoluminescent and phosphorescent emissions on temperature, corroborated the direct and reverse intersystem crossing interplay between singlet and triplet states. Molecular aggregation is responsible for the deterioration of non-blended triazole films phosphorescence. (C) 2018 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

The prepared materials were characterized by Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, inductively coupled plasma, N-2 adsorption-desorption, and vibrating sample magnetometry. This self-assembled nanosystem acted as an efficient magnetically recyclable noble metal-based multifunctional nanocatalyst. It showed excellent catalytic activity and stability for the Heck reaction of iodobenzene and styrene under mild conditions. The methods used to prepare the Pd-Fe3O4 catalysts were simple and low-cost, which will be useful for the large-scale development and application of a magnetically recoverable Pd catalyst.

AB NOx are major air pollutants, having negative impact on environment and consequently, human health. We propose here the single- electron reduction of NOx (x = 1, 2) using superalkalis. We study the interaction of NOx with FLi2, OLi3 and NLi4 superalkalis using density functional and single- point CCSD(T) calculations, which lead to stable superalkali- NOx ionic complexes with negatively charged NOx. This clearly reveals that the NOx can successfully be reduced to NOx anion due to electron transfer from superalkalis. It has been also noticed that the size of superalkalis plays a crucial in the single- electron reduction of NOx. (C) 2018 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB From first-principles calculations based on density functional theory, we find that the recently synthesized beta(12) boron sheet is a perfect candidate for calcium-decoration and hydrogen storage application. In contrast to graphene where defects are required to capture Ca, the naturally formed hexagonal hollow ring in beta(12) boron sheet provides the ideal site for Ca adsorption, and up to 6H(2) molecules for each Ca atom can be captured with a desirable binding energy of similar to 0.2 eV/H-2. The gravimetric hydrogen density for Ca decorated boron sheet can reach up to 8.92 wt%. From the electronic analysis, it is found that both the orbital hybridizations and polarization mechanism play significant roles in H-2 adsorption and storage. (C) 2018 Elsevier B. V.

AB It is demonstrated that in fullerene C-70, there is a withdrawal of an Electrodynamical forbiddance of a strong quadrupole light-molecule interaction, which is realized in the fullerene C-60. This situation occurs because of the reduction of symmetry of C-70 from the icosahedral symmetry group Y-h to the group D-5h. The withdrawal results in appearance of the lines in the SERS spectra of C-70, which are forbidden in usual Raman scattering and are allowed in infrared absorption. The measured SERS spectra of C-70 demonstrates existence of such lines that strongly confirms our ideas about the dipole -quadrupole SERS mechanism. (C) 2018 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB Singlet fission has been analyzed with the Dexter model in which electron exchange occurs between chromophores, conserving the spin for each electron. In the present study, we propose a spin exchange model for singlet fission. In the spin exchange model, spins are exchanged by the exchange interaction between two electrons. Our analysis with simple spin functions demonstrates that singlet fission is possible by spin exchange. A necessary condition for spin exchange is a variation in exchange interactions. We also adapt the spin exchange model to triplet fusion and triplet energy transfer, which often occur after singlet fission in organic solids. (C) 2018 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB The cyclic water-trimer encapsulations into D-2(22)-C-84 fullerene are evaluated. The encapsulation energy is computed at the M06-2X/6-31++ G** level and it is found that the trimer storage in C-84 yields the potential-energy gain of 10.4 kcal/mol. The encapsulated trimer can have two different forms, either the conformation known with the free gas-phase water trimer or the arrangement with the three nonhydrogen bonded H atoms on the same side of the O-O-O plane. The latter endohedral isomer is lower in the potential energy by 0.071 kcal/mol and forms about 57% of their equilibrium mixture at room temperature. (C) 2018 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB Background & Aims: Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a global health problem and the outcome are associated with both viral factors and host genetic factors. High Throughput Sequencing (HTS) technology were used to identify variants associated with liver disease.
   Methods: Fifty-five Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients, fifty-three self-healing HBV (SH) patients and 53 healthy controls (HC) were recruited, 404 cytokine and cytokine receptor related genes were captured and sequenced at high depth (> 900X), both variant (Fischer's exact test, P value < 0.05) and gene (SKAT-O gene level test, adjust P value < 0.05) level association were used to identify variants and genes associated with CHB.
   Results: Total 5083 variants have been detected, fifty-four variants were found associated with CHB, most (29/32) variants were located in HLA region, including HLA-B, HLA-C, HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQB1, HLA-DQB2, HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DRES. Several missense variants were found associated with CHB, including p.E226K in PVR (poliovirus receptor), p.E400A and p.C431R in 1L4R (interleukin 4 receptor). Four variants located in 3'UTR (untranslated region) have also been found associated with CHB.
   Conclusion: Our study revealed that high through target region sequencing, combined with association analysis at variant and gene level, would be a good way to found variants and genes associated with CHB even at small sample size. Our data implied that chronic hepatitis B patients who carry these variants need intensive monitoring.

AB Up to 50% of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD) experience a loss of response (LOR) to infliximab after an initial response to the drug. Granulocyte/monocyte apheresis (GMA) with the Adacolumn depletes the activated myeloid leukocytes that are known to exacerbate and perpetuate inflammatory bowel diseases, but GMA has hitherto not been applied to patients with LOR to infliximab. We report three cases (2 UC and 1CD) with LOR to maintenance infliximab therapy that received one GMA session/week for 3 consecutive weeks or more. The disease severity was assessed from the CD activity index or partial Mayo score, and the trough infliximab (TI) level was measured. Upon GMA therapy, all three patients achieved remission for up to 15 months with maintenance infliximab alone. The average plasma TI increased from 0.91 pg/mL to 1.46 pg/mL, with concomitant decreases of C-reactive protein (from 2.33 mg/dL to 0.78 mg/dL), interleukin-6 (from 8.4 pg/mL to 3.4 pg/mL), and interleukin-17A (from 0.21 pg/mL to 0.03 pg/mL). To our best knowledge, this is the first report of adding a non-drug GMA to restore the efficacy of infliximab. The outcomes, albeit in three cases, are relevant in therapeutic settings and should inspire further studies in a larger number of patients.

AB The impact of early antiretroviral therapy (ART) during Primary HIV Infection (PHI) on the hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) homeostasis is not available. This study aimed to characterize HPCs and their relationship with cytokines regulating progenitors function in ART-treated patients with PHI.
   We enrolled HIV infected patients treated with ART during PHI. Circulating HPCs, Lymphoid-HPCs (L-HPCs) frequency and plasmatic concentrations of IL-7, IL-18 and Stem Cell Factor (SCF) were analysed at baseline and after 6 months of therapy.
   ART introduction during PHI restored the decline of L-HPCs, induced a decrease in the level of pro-inflammatory IL-18 cytokine and a parallel increase of SCF. Moreover, L-HPCs frequency positively correlated with IL-18 at baseline, and with SCF after 6 months of therapy, suggesting that different signals impact L-HPCs expansion and maintenance before and after treatment. Finally, the SCF receptor expression on HPCs decreased after early ART initiation.
   These insights may open new perspectives for the evaluation of cytokine-driven L-HPCs expansion and their impact on the homeostasis of hematopoietic compartment during HIV infection.

ID 1,25-DIHYDROXYVITAMIN D-3; STABILITY; DISEASE
AB Background & Aims: Vitamin D has immune modulating effects on cytokines. Serum vitamin D levels are associated with the risk of relapse in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), through unknown mechanisms. We tested the hypothesis that this beneficial role of vitamin D on UC is mediated through anti-inflammatory serum cytokine profiles.
   Methods: Serum samples from a prospective cohort of seventy UC patients in clinical remission were collected and baseline histological and endoscopic scores were recorded at enrollment. Clinical relapse events were recorded over the 12-month follow-up period. Serum vitamin D and cytokines levels (IL-6, IL-8, IL-17A, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-4, IL-10) were quantified using ELISA. Linear regression was used to determine correlation between vitamin D and cytokine profiles. Logistic regression models were used to determine the association between serum cytokine profiles and baseline histologic mucosal healing and clinical relapse.
   Results: Higher serum vitamin D levels positively correlated with higher ratios of IL-4 + IL-10/IL-17A + TNF-alpha (r = 0.37, P <.01), and IL-4 + IL-10/IL-6 + TNF-alpha (r = 0.32, P <.01). In multivariate analysis, IL-4 + IL-10/IL-17A + TNF-alpha ratios at baseline were associated with the presence of histologic mucosal healing (O.R. 1.29, 95% CI 1.02-1.62, P =.03). A higher ratio of serum IL-4 + IL-10 to IL-6 + TNF-alpha was associated with a reduced risk of clinical relapse (O.R. 0.72, 95% Cl 0.58-0.89, P =.003), and longer time to relapse (p =.03), over the 12-month follow-up period. This ratio during remission had an AUC of 0.7 in predicting later clinical relapse.
   Conclusions: Vitamin D is associated with anti-inflammatory serum cytokine profiles. Anti-inflammatory cytokine patterns may mediate the protective effects of higher serum vitamin D levels in patients with ulcerative colitis.

AB Background: Atrial fibrillation(AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia. Its most feared sequelae are stroke and peripheral thromboembolism due to atrial thrombi formation. Mechanisms underlying the relationship between platelet activation and left atrial thrombi have not been clearly elucidated yet. We aimed to investigate whether immune-mediated platelet activation occurred in AF patients in this cross-sectional study.
   Methods: Persistent and paroxysmal AF patients who underwent cryoballoon-based AF ablation between March 2015 and July 2016 were included as the patient group. Patients without AF in whom transseptal puncture was performed at the same period for purposes other than AF ablation were included as the control group. Peripheral and left atrial blood samples were obtained for determination of platelet Toll-like receptor(TLR)-2, TLR-4 and high mobility group box-1(HMGB-1) expression levels.
   Results: A total of 75 subjects (53 patients with AF and 22 control subjects) [mean: 60.33 (SD: 6.14) years, 57.33% male] were included. Left atrial and peripheral TLR-2, 4 and HMGB-1 expression levels were significantly higher in the patient group when compared to the controls. Left atrial platelet TLR-2 and TLR-4 expression and serum HMGB-1 levels were higher in persistent AF patients compared to paroxysmal AF patients. In the patient group, left atrial expression of TLR-2, 4 and HMGB-1 were significantly higher than the peripheral expression levels.
   Conclusion: Findings of our study suggest evidence for immune-mediated platelet activation in the left atria of AF patients.

AB Objectives: Regulatory cytokines are associated with viral infection. The objective of this study was to evaluate the relation between serum regulatory cytokines concentrations and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) disease.
   Methods: We enrolled 325 children aged < 24 months who were diagnosed with acute respiratory tract infection. Twenty age-matched healthy children were enrolled as controls. Nasopharyngeal swabs were analyzed to identify virus by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and blood samples were taken to quantify the regulatory cytokine concentrations, including interleukin (IL)-35, IL-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 1 using the Bio-Plex immunoassay or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
   Results: RSV disease was associated with a great regulatory cytokine response than healthy children, among 89 RSV-infected patients, serum IL-35 (P =.0001) and IL-10 (P =.006) was significantly elevated in comparison with healthy controls. Young children (0 < age <= 6 months) with RSV infection had significantly lower IL-35 and IL-10 expression but needed more oxygen therapy and more severe disease comparing with older children (12 < age < 24 months). Comparing with mild group, the expression levels of IL-10 were significantly lower in children with moderate and severe disease (P =.012 and P =.005, respectively). And levels of IL-10 was inversely associated with total duration of RSV infection symptoms (r = 0.311, P =.019).
   Conclusion: Children with RSV infected had increased serum regulatory cytokine IL-10 and IL-35 concentrations. Elevated expression of IL-10 and IL-35 were contributed to protect hypoxia and reduce the severity of disease.

AB Purpose: Signaling pathways involved in electrical, structural and contractile remodeling processes behind development and progression of atrial fibrillation (AF) have not been completely elucidated, but it seems to be related to complex interactions among neurohormonal and cellular mediators. We aimed to investigate interleukin-6 (IL-6), transforming growth factor-betal (TGF-beta 1), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), as biomarkers of atrial remodeling, in patients with paroxysmal and persistent AF, and their correlation with N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and left atrial (LA) diameter.
   Methods: Thirty-seven patients (22M/15F) with paroxysmal AF, 32 patients (22M/10F) with persistent AF and 30 healthy control subjects (18M/12F) were enrolled in the study. Serum levels of biomarkers were measured by ELISA. Cardiac function was assessed echocardiographically.
   Results: IL-6 levels and MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratio were significantly higher in AF patients than in non-AF controls (P <.001), and in persistent than in paroxysmal AF (P <.001), in line with NT-proBNP and LA diameter. In contrast, TGF-beta 1 levels declined with increasing AF duration (from 51.2 pg/mL, IQR: 38.9-87.9 pg/mL in paroxysmal to 23.9 pg/mL, IQR: 16.9-43.6 pg/mL in persistent AF). TGF-beta 1 was negatively correlated with NTproBNP (r = 0.53, P =.001 in paroxysmal AF and r = 0.71, P <.001 in persistent AF) and LA diameter (r = 0.44, P =.006 in paroxysmal AF and r = 0.51, P =.003 in persistent AF).
   Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that AF development and progression (from paroxysmal to persistent) is associated with a gradual increase in serum levels of NT-proBNP, IL-6 and MMP-9/T1MP-1 ratio. Moreover, this study suggests that the relationship between TGF-beta 1, NT-proBNP and LA diameter allows for the progression of atrial remodeling during AF, despite compensatory changes in the TGF-beta 1 signaling pathway.

AB The association between excessive training sessions (i.e., overtraining/OT) and periods of inadequate recovery is linked to the nonfunctional overreaching (NFOR) state, which is defined as an unexplained decrement or stagnation of performance. The cytokine hypothesis of OT considers that pro-inflammatory cytokines are responsible by the NFOR state-induced performance decrement. Investigations using rodent models of OT verified increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in hypothalamus, liver, serum and skeletal muscle samples. Recently, our research group observed that a 2-week total recovery period was not able to re-establish the NFOR state-induced performance decrement. As the responses of anti- and pro-inflammatory cytokines were not measured, we aimed to investigate the effects of 2-week total recovery period on the protein contents of IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-10, IL-15, TNF-alpha and SOCS-3 in serum and skeletal muscle samples of overtrained mice. Also, a bioinformatics analysis was performed to investigate the correlations of IL-lbeta, IL-6, IL-10, IL-15, TNF-alpha and SOCS-3 in skeletal muscle with locomotor activity. In summary, the 2-week total recovery period upregulated the anti-inflammatory cytokines and normalized the pro-inflammatory cytokines without a concomitant re-establishment of performance.

AB Guillain Barre Syndrome (GBS) is a severe disorder of the peripheral nervous system with an inadequately known etiopathology. It is a post infectious immune mediated disorder, characterized by autoantibody production, complement activation as well as T reactivity against gangliosides. However, the precise etiopathogenesis remains poorly understood in a majority of the patients. Th17 cells, a recently identified lineage of Th cells have emerged as a predominant inducer of autoimmunity and inflammation in various immunological disorders. Pathobiological role of Th17 pathway is also becoming increasingly apparent in the nervous system disorders. Two cytokines, such as IL-23, known to determine the pathogenic potential of Th17 cells and IL-17, a prototype effector cytokine of Th17 pathway can form IL-23/IL-17 immune axis. Aberrant functioning of this immune axis has been implicated in many autoimmune diseases. Therapeutic strategies that potentially target this immune axis have shown encouraging results in diseases with immunological underpinnings. Preliminary data obtained both from animal and clinical studies indicate a possible role of this immune axis in GBS. Herein, we explore and highlight the relevance and functional implications of IL-23/IL-17 immune axis in GBS. Understanding this immune axis may shed important insights into the etiology and treatment of GBS.

AB Aging is closely associated with osteoarthritis (OA). Although its underlying mechanisms remain unknown, cellular senescence in chondrocytes has become an important therapeutic target for the treatment of OA. Cysteinyl leukotriene receptors (cysLTRs) mediate the pathobiological function of cysteinyl leukotrienes (cysLTs). However, the roles of cysLTRs in the pathogenesis of OA have not been reported before. In the current study, we found that cysLTR1 but not cysLTR2 is expressed in human primary chondrocytes. In addition, stimulation with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) resulted in a significant increase in the expression of cysLTR1. Interestingly, montelukast, a specific cysLTR1 antagonist, attenuated TNF-alpha-induced up-regulation of the activity of senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-Gal). In addition, TNF-alpha led to cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase, which was prevented by treatment with montelukast. Notably, montelukast reduced expression of the senescence markers p53, p21 and PAI-1. In addition, montelukast ameliorated TNF-alpha-induced K382 acetylation of p53 by promoting the expression of SIRT1. Silencing of SIRT1 using SIRT1 siRNA broke the inhibitory effects of montelukast on K382 acetylation of p53. Importantly, silencing of cysLTR1 reversed the reduction of SIRT1 expression as well as the K382 acetylation of p53. Our findings strongly implicate that cysLTR1 has the capacity to regulate cellular senescence in chondrocytes. It is suggested that montelukast may be a potential therapeutic agent for chondro-protective therapy.

AB Emerging evidence shows that chronic low-grade inflammation and changes in markers of innate immunity are implicated in a range of metabolic abnormalities following an episode of acute pancreatitis. Also, deranged iron metabolism has been linked to type 2 diabetes mellitus, gestational diabetes, and new-onset diabetes after pancreatitis the conditions characterized by high haemoglobin glycation index (HGI). This study aimed to investigate the associations between markers of innate immunity and iron metabolism in individuals after acute pancreatitis. Fasting blood samples were collected to analyse lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP), interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, hepcidin, ferritin, soluble transferrin receptor, HbAlc, and glucose. Participants were categorized into two groups: low HGI and high HGI. Linear regression analyses were conducted, and potential confounders (age, sex, ethnicity, body mass index, diabetes mellitus status, smoking status, aetiology of pancreatitis, duration, recurrence, and severity of pancreatitis) were adjusted for in 5 statistical models. A total of 93 patients following an episode of acute pancreatitis were included, of who 40 (43%) had high HGI. In the overall cohort, LBP was significantly associated with hepcidin and ferritin, and IL-6 was significantly associated with hepcidin, consistently in all the models. Further, LBP contributed to 7.7% and 9.5% of variance in hepcidin and ferritin levels, respectively, whereas IL-6 contributed to 5.3% of hepcidin variance. Upon subgroup analysis, the observed LBP associations were maintained in the high HGI subgroup only and the IL-6 association in the low HGI subgroup only. No consistently significant associations were found between any of the other markers.

AB The majority of Parkinson's disease (PD) cases are sporadic with only about 10% of PD patients having a family history of the disease suggesting that this neurodegenerative disorder is the result of both environmental and genetic factors. Both oxidative stress and neuroinflammation are thought to contribute to PD. Previously, we showed that the activation of interleukin 13 receptor alpha 1 (IL-13R alpha 1) increases the sensitivity of dopaminergic neurons to oxidative damage both in cultured cells and in animals. In this study, we investigated the pathways involved in the IL-13-mediated potentiation of oxidative stress-induced dopaminergic cell death using a combination of cell survival assays and Western blotting with appropriate antibodies. In addition, siRNA was used to examine the role of 4E-BP1 in this cell toxicity paradigm. We show that activation of both the Jak-Stat and PI3 kinase-mTOR pathways play key roles in the promotion of cell death by IL-13 in the presence of mild oxidative stress. The Jak 1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib, the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin and the PI3 kinase inhibitor LY294002 all prevented the potentiation of cell death by IL-13. Moreover, 4E-BP1, a target of mTOR, appeared to mediate the protective effects of rapamycin. Together, these results indicate that multiple signaling pathways downstream of IL-13R alpha 1 activation play a role in the toxic effects of IL-13 in dopaminergic neurons in the presence of mild oxidative stress and suggest that any of these pathways might provide potential targets for the treatment of PD.

AB Interleukin-7 (IL-7) exerts crucial functions on lymphoid cells' development and maintenance. In breast cancer (BC), IL-7 promotes growth of tumor cells in culture through the activation of JAK1/3-STAT5 and PI3K/AKT pathways, and expression of IL-7 signaling components was associated with worst prognosis. A C > T polymorphism (rs6897932; Thr24411e) at exon 6 of IL-7 receptor alpha (IL-7R alpha) gene (IL7RA) shifts the balance between the membrane-bound and soluble 1L-7R alpha splicing variants and was previously associated with auto immune diseases, but has not been studied in cancer, including BC, so far. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the possible association of this polymorphism with the susceptibility and clinicopathological parameters of BC subgroups. IL7RA Thr2441Ie was genotyped through PCR-RFLP in 403 women without neoplasia, no personal history of malignancy or family history of BC and in 338 BC patients with clinicopathological data available. BC patients were stratified according to their positivity for estrogen (ER) and/or progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Age-adjusted logistic regression was performed for case-control analyses, and correlations with clinicopathological parameters were assessed through Kendall's Taub coefficient. All analyses were two-tailed and had 95% confidence interval. In ER-PR-HER2- BCs, TT genotype was associated with increased susceptibility both in genotypic (TT vs. CC: OR = 3.07; CI = 1.01-9.38; p = 0.05) and recessive (TT vs. CC + CT: OR = 3.59; CI = 1.19-10.85; p = 0.02) models and negatively correlated with disease stage (Tau-b =-0.27; p = 0.05). Whereas T allele was positively correlated with histopathological grade (Tau-b = 0.29; p = 0.03) and lymph node metastasis (Tau-b = 0.35; p = 0.02) in ER/ PR+ HEAT' BCs and with Ki67 (Tau-b = 0.51; p = 0.008) in ER-PR-HER2'' subgroup. These data indicate that IL-7R alpha is involved in BC, and that IL7RA polymorphism may play distinct roles in breast carcinogenesis according to BC subtype, pointing this genetic variant as an interesting marker for breast carcinogenesis to be validated by further mechanistic and prospective studies with larger samples.

AB Stimulation of Ca2+ permeable TRPM3 (transient receptor potential melastatin-3) channels with the steroid ligand pregnenolone sulfate activates stimulus-responsive transcription factors, including the transcription factor AP-1 (activator protein-1). As part of a search for AP-1-regulated target genes we analyzed the gene encoding interleukin-8 (IL-8) in HEK293 cells expressing TRPM3 channels. Here, we show that stimulation of TRPM3 channels activated transcription of an IL-8 promoter-controlled reporter gene that was embedded into the chromatin of the cells. Mutational analysis of the IL-8 promoter revealed that the AP-1 binding site of the IL-8 promoter was essential to connect TRPM3 stimulation with the transcription of the IL-8 gene. Genetic experiments revealed that the basic region leucine zipper proteins c-Jun and ATF2 and the ternary complex factor Elk-1 are essential to couple TRPM3 channel stimulation with the IL-8 gene. Moreover, we identified extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK1/2) as signal transducer connecting TRPM3 stimulation with enhanced transcription of the IL-8 gene. Furthermore, we show that stimulation of TRPC6 (transient receptor potential canonical-6) channels with its ligand hyperforin also increased 1L-8 promoter activity, involving the AP-1 binding site within the IL-8 gene, suggesting that activation of IL-8 gene transcription may be a common theme following TRP channel stimulation.

AB The novelty of an effective therapeutic targeting for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is based on improved understanding of each component of tumor microenvironment (TME) and its correspondent interactions at biological and molecular levels. In this context, new expansions for the treatment against TME and its communication with HCC are under exploration. Despite of the fact that blockage of growth factor receptors has become a treatment of choice in late phases of HCC in clinical practice, still a precise targeted treatment should address all the components of TME. Targeting one specific element out of cellular (cancer associated fibroblasts, endothelial cells, hepatic stellate cells, Kupffer cells and lymphocytes) or non-cellular (extracellular matrix, growth factors, inflammatory cytokines, proteolytic enzymes) parts of TME may not be a successful remedy for the disease because of well-designed hindrances of each component and their functional alternativeness. Meanwhile there are some elements of TME like epithelial-mesenchymal transition and CAF, which are considerably important and need thorough investigations. Ascertaining the potential role of these elements, and a single or combinational drug therapy targeting these elements of TME simultaneously, may provide the appreciable considerations to eventually improve in clinical practices and may also minimize the chances of reoccurrence of HCC.

AB The key point of this work is to study the impact of sulfur oxidizing bacteria (SOB), namely Acidithiobacillus Thiooxidans NCIMB 8343, on the properties of eco-friendly alkali activated slag (AAS), ceramic waste (AACW) and glass waste (AAGW) industrial solid wastes. Ordinary Portland cement (OPC) was used as reference. After 14-days of curing in tap water, all hardened cement pastes were exposed to pure carbon dioxide, which decreased the pH value of hardened cement surface, allowing the bacterial attack. The detrimental impact of biogenic sulfuric acid, induced by SOB, was evaluated by measuring the cationic leaching, weight, compressive strength and total porosity variations. The change in phase composition and the morphology of cement phases was investigated by Fourier transformer infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The AAS (with low Ca/Si ratio) showed the higher resistivity against SOB attack comparing with OPC-paste (with high Ca/Si ratio) up to 360-days of incubation. On the other hand, the AAGW (containing low alumina content) exhibited biodegradable signs with higher Na-leaching rate, higher compressive strength declination and porosity increment rates as well as larger weight loss as compared to AACW (containing high alumina mass, %).

AB Green roofs are a key component to building sustainable cities because of their multiple environmental benefits, but without the proper level of care, the leachate from green roofs might contain pollutants and become a new nonpoint pollution source in urban areas. Because its leachate quality is affected by the substrates and plants used, the objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of the substrates and plants with the aim of improving green roof applications. This study tested 3 materials - normal cultivated (C) substrate, commercial green roof (L) substrate, and mixed C and recycled glass (R) substrate - with a focus on using recycled glass materials in the green roof system. Recycled glass is a lightweight and porous material that improves pollutant absorption and water quality purification. Three different types of plants were tested: a sedum, a fern, and a shrub. Therefore, this study evaluated 9 combinations, each with 3 replicates. The differences in the substrates exerted significant effects on the chemical oxygen demand (COD) and phosphorous (P) concentrations. The nitrogen (N) concentrations were affected by differences in both the substrates and the plants. The changes in the observed water quality with time implied that compact substrates and mature plants reduced pollutant concentrations, except for N concentrations, in the outflow. The L substrate contained high levels of nutrients, and the plants grew better in this substrate than in the other two substrates; however, the L substrate also produced higher pollution concentrations. The R substrate, with recycled glass, performed well in the neutralization of acid rain but did not significantly reduce the levels of other pollutants. To enhance the purification ability of the recycled glass, the mixing ratio between the recycled glass and organic substances and the placement in the substrate are important factors.

AB Enhanced floating treatment wetlands (EFTWs) were established to treat water with different concentrations of ammonia and nitrate, the ratios of which were set at 0:3, 1:2, 2:1 and 3:0, respectively. The results showed that the average total nitrogen (TN) removals were 80.7%, 79.2%, 47.0% and 10.1% in those four treatments, respectively. EFTWs had much better removal ability of NO3--N (82.8-98.1%) than that of NH4 (+)-N (25.1-59.4%). Canna indica L. in the water containing both NH4+-N and NO3--N experienced higher relative growth rate and absorption capacity of N (7.7 g/m(2)) and P (1.5 g/m(2)) than those with the sole N source. The relative abundance of narG and nirK on the plant roots and biofilm carriers in the six nitrogen functional genes accounted for 71.1-85.6% and 58.5-90.3%, respectively, leading to high denitrification in EFTWs. Therefore, N forms in water could affect biomass accumulation and attached microorganisms, and thus affect the water purification efficiencies of EFTWs.

AB Previous studies have mainly focused on bat mortality through collision by wind turbines, and very few studies have assessed the indirect impacts on bat activity and on foraging habitat availability. Also, there is a global lack of knowledge on the vulnerability of tropical bat fauna due to wind energy production, even though it is well known that windpower can affect bat communities and biodiversity hotspots are widespread in the tropics. We present one of the first studies to quantify the indirect impact of wind farms on insectivorous bats in tropical hotspots of biodiversity. Bat activity was compared between wind farm sites and control sites, via ultrasound recordings at stationary points. The activity of bent winged bats (Miniopterus sp.) and wattled bats (Chalinolobus sp.) were both significantly lower at wind turbine sites. The result of the study demonstrates a large effect on bat habitat use at wind turbines sites compared to control sites. Bat activity was 20 times higher at control sites compared to wind turbine sites, which suggests that habitat loss is an important impact to consider in wind farm planning We strongly recommend that the loss of the foraging habitat loss is considered in mitigation hierarchy (avoiding, reducing, offsetting) when compensating for negative impacts of wind farms.

AB Shallow water seagrass meadows are frequently damaged by recreational and commercial vessels. Severe injury occurs where propeller scarring, hull groundings and mooring anchors uproot entire plants, excavate sediments, and modify the biophysical properties of the substrate. In climax tropical seagrass communities dominated by Thalassia testudinum (turtlegrass), natural recovery in these disturbances can take several years to decades, and in some environmental conditions may not occur at all. During the recovery period, important ecological services provided by seagrasses are absent or substantially diminished and injured meadows can degrade further in response to natural disturbances, e.g. strong currents and severe storms. To determine if we could accelerate rehabilitation and prevent further degradation of injured turtlegrass meadows, we evaluated a restoration method called "modified compressed succession" using the fast-growing, opportunistic species Halodule wrightii to temporarily substitute ecological services for the slower-growing, climax species T. testudinum. In three experiments we showed statistically significant increases in density and coverage rates of H. wrightii transplants fertilized by wild bird feces as compared to unfertilized treatments. In one experiment, we further demonstrated that regrading excavated injuries with sediment-filled biodegradable tubes in combination with wild bird fertilization and H. wrightii transplants also accelerated seagrass recovery. Specific recommendations are presented for the best practical application of this restoration method in the calcium carbonate-based sediments of south Florida and the wider Caribbean region.

AB Soil aggregation processes play a crucial role in re-establishing soil structure and function, and protecting soil organic carbon (SOC) to sustain soil fertility and quality. There is a strong interest in preventing soil erosion in the interface of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem. The relationship between soil aggregates and SOC in riparian zones is not as well studied as in terrestrial ecosystems. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of conversion of abandoned lands to cultivated lands on organic carbon (C) and soil structure. Soil samples and plant residues were collected from abandoned lands and cultivated lands which had been converted from abandoned lands over 10 years ago. Results show that SOC content and storage increases by 1.64 times and 6.75 Mg hm(-2), respectively, after the land use change. For cultivated lands, 11.94% of macro-aggregates (> 2 mm) were broken into micro-aggregates (< 2 mm), resulting in the mean weight diameter (MWD) and geometric mean diameter (GMD) decreases of 1.01 and 1.11 mm, respectively, while the fractal dimension (FD) increased by 0.28. The SOC content of micro-aggregates (10.88-15.02 g kg(-1)) was higher than that of macro-aggregates (10.10-11.63 g kg(-1)) for both abandoned and cultivated lands. The SOC content of micro-aggregates for cultivated lands (14.46-15.02 g kg(-1)) was higher than abandoned lands (10.80-11.14 g kg(-1)). The content of microbial biomass carbon (MBC) increased by 1.52 times due to increases in root biomass and the plant residue returned to soil, which were mainly caused by the changes in cultivation practices and soil water conditions. Our results show that total SOC storage increased by the land use conversion from abandoned to cultivated lands, indicating that planting aquatic plants might be an effective method of preventing C loss from riparian ecosystems. The findings of this study provided insights into the changes in soil aggregates and soil C sequestration following the land use changes in riparian areas.

AB Ecosystem-based coastal protection by means of conserving, restoring or creating intertidal ecosystems that attenuate waves and stabilize shorelines, offers a promising way to climate proof coastlines for the future. The Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) is an ecosystem engineering species, which is known for its wave attenuating and sediment trapping ecosystem services, but it remains unknown to which extent this is conditional. We aim to test the hypothesis that the ecosystem engineering effect concerning sediment trapping and stability by oyster reefs is conditional, and can be predicted based on i) local physical forcing, ii) morphological characteristics of the tidal flat, and iii) biological characteristics of the oyster reef.
   Analyses of long-term sediment accretion patterns on natural intertidal oyster reefs at the Oosterschelde basin (The Netherlands) showed that this ecosystem engineering effect is strongest on tidal flats under erosional conditions, lower aspect ratio (i.e., relative long and narrow reefs), relatively closed reefs (i.e., few open patches) and higher coverage of oysters within reef patches. The ability of C. gigas to shape the environment thus depends both on biotic and abiotic conditions, meaning that oyster reefs only work under specific conditions for erosion control. Overall, our results provide baseline understanding for ecosystem management aimed at affecting sediment dynamics, thereby contributing to a better understanding for designing ecosystem-based solutions under different abiotic and biotic conditions. In addition, present study provides a clear example of how we need to gain a better understanding of the conditionality of ecosystem services in general, to be able to create and restore ecosystems for obtaining their services.

AB Many coastal habitats are being substantially altered by non-indigenous plants (NIP). In the present study, intertidal macrobenthic communities of three habitats - a non-vegetated tidal flat (TF), a marsh with the smooth cordgrass Spartina alterniflora (SA) and a Kandelia candel mangrove forest (KC) - were examined during periods of ebb tide in February, May, August and November 2015 in Ximen Island Special Marine Protected Area, Zhejiang Province, China. S. alterniflora was introduced from North America in 1979 and invaded Ximen Island spontaneously. K. candel was a direct, artificial introduction in 1957 from Fujian, China. A total of 48 species of macrobenthos were collected from Ximen Island. The average density of macrobenthos in TF, SA and KC was 1365, 1398 and 669 ind./m(2), respectively, and the average biomass of macrobenthos in TF, SA and KC was 144.13, 43.00 and 138.70 g/m(2), respectively. There were no significant differences among the three habitats on density and biomass of macrobenthos, with the exception of density in spring and biomass in autumn. Diversity indices of macrobenthos did not exhibit significant differences among the three habitats, except for Margalef's richness index (d) in KC. However, Results of one-way analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) revealed significant differences in macrobenthic community structure among the three habitats and four seasons. It was concluded that, although few significant differences were observed in the density, biomass and diversity indices of macrobenthos among habitats, there were significant changes in the macrobenthic communities' structure after the introduction of S. alterniflora and K. candel. Therefore, when we use plants as ecological engineering materials, we need to take into account all of their potential ecological consequences.

AB Hyporheic zone is an important region of nitrogen removal in river systems. Hyporheic exchange generally leads to heterogeneous redox environments, which are conducive to nitrogen transformation. This study seeks to determine the influence of hyporheic upwelling fluxes on inorganic nitrogen (NH4+, NO3-, and NO2-) concentrations in the sediment pore water of the Weihe River, China. The patterns and magnitudes of hyporheic water exchange on 12 August 2016 were derived by a one-dimensional heat transport model, and inorganic nitrogen concentrations in the pore water, surface water, and groundwater were obtained. The results indicated that hyporheic water exchange was characterized by upwelling at each point during the test period. Moreover, NH4+ dominated the hyporheic zone from 0 to 45 cm, likely due to organic nitrogen mineralization. Additionally, a non-linear relationship was observed between NH4+ concentrations and upwelling fluxes. This relationship was derived by analyzing the effect of upwelling on biogeochemical activity and nitrogen transformation. Notably, increasing upwelling fluxes less than 400 mm/d resulted in high NH4+ concentrations, whereas fluxes exceeding 400 mm/d led to low NH4+ concentrations. Overall, the variations in inorganic nitrogen associated with hyporheic water exchange are of great importance for controlling nitrogen pollution and maintaining sustainable health in river systems.

AB Water quality performance of eight roadside bioretention cells in their third and fourth years of implementation were evaluated in Burlington, Vermont. Bioretention cells received varying treatments: (1) vegetation with high-diversity (7 species) and low-diversity plant mix (2 species); (2) proprietary SorbtiveMedia (TM) (SM) containing iron and aluminum oxide granules to enhance sorption capacity for phosphorus; and (3) enhanced rainfall and runoff (RR) to certain cells (including one with SM treatment) at three levels (15%, 20%, 60% more than their control counterparts), mimicking anticipated precipitation increases associated with climate change. A total of 121 storms across all cells were evaluated in 2015 and 2016 for total suspended solids (TSS), nitrate/nitritenitrogen (NOx), ortho-phosphorus (Ortho-P), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP). Heavy metals were also measured for a few storms, but in 2014 and 2015 only. Simultaneous measurements of flow rates and volumes allowed for evaluation of the cells' hydraulic performances and estimation of pollutant load removal efficiencies and EMC reductions. Significant average reductions in effluent stormwater volumes (75%; range: 48-96%) and peak flows (91%; range: 86-96%) was reported, with 31% of the storms events (all less than 25.4mm (1 in.), and one 39.4mm (1.55 in.)) depth completely captured by bioretention cells. Influent TSS concentrations and event mean concentrations (EMCs) was mostly significantly reduced, and TSS loads were well retained by all bioretention cells (94%; range: 89-99%) irrespective of treatments, storm characteristics or seasonality. In contrast, nutrient removal was treatment-dependent, where the SM treatments consistently removed P concentrations, loads and EMCs, and sometimes N as well. The vegetation and RR treatments mostly exported nutrients to the effluent for those three metrics with varying significance. We attribute observed nutrient exports to the presence of excess compost in the soil media. Rainfall depth and peak inflow rate had consistently negative effects on all nutrient removal efficiencies from the bioretention cells likely by increasing pollutant mobilization. Seasonality followed by soil media presence, and antecedent dry period were other predictors significantly influencing removal efficiencies for some nutrient types. Results from the analysis will be useful to make bioretention designers aware of the hydrologic and other design factors that will be the most critical to the performance of the bioretention systems in response to interactive effects of climate change.

TI Estimation of mortality and survival of individual trees after
   harvesting wood using artificial neural networks in the amazon rain
   forest
SO ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING

AB Modeling individual trees in tropical rain forests in the Amazon allows for the safe use of scarce resources in a sustainable way. Unfortunately, in the Brazilian Amazon, rain forest growth and production models are not yet used to estimate future forest stock. Thus, forest management plans do not present technical-scientific support that guarantees sustainable production of wood throughout the cutting cycle. Therefore, this work aims to estimate the survival and mortality of individual trees in a selectively harvested forest using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to support silvicultural decisions in forest management in the Amazon rain forest. In 1979, a selective harvest was carried out, with 72.5 m3 ha-1 in an area of 64 ha in Floresta Nacional do Tapajos, in the state of Para, Brazil. In 1981, 36 permanent plots were installed at random and inventoried. Nine successive measurements were carried from 1982 to 2012. In the modeling, classification, survival, and mortality, training and ANN testing were performed, using input variables such as: different semi-distance-independent competition indices (DSICI), diameter measured (dbh), forest class (FC), trunk identification class (TIC), competition index (CI), growth groups (GG), liana infestation intensity (liana); and crown lighting (CL); Damage to tree (D) and tree rotting (R). The categorical output variables (Classification) were Dead or Surviving tree. Overall efficiency of the classification was above 89% in training and above 90% in the test for all ANNs. Survival classification hit rate was above 99% in the test and training for all ANNs but the mortality score was low, with hit rates below 6%. The overall Kappa coefficient was below 8% for all ANNs (ranked "poor") but all ANNs were above 55% in the survival classification (ranked "good"). ANN estimates the individual survival of trees more accurately but this does not occur with mortality, which is a rarer event than survival.

AB Woodchip denitrification bioreactors are an important edge-of-field practice for treating agricultural drainage; however, their ability to filter microbial pollutants has primarily been explored in the context of wastewater treatment. Upflow column reactors were constructed and tested for E. coli, Salmonella, NO3-N, and dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) at hydraulic retention times (HRTs) of 12 and 24 h and at controlled temperatures of 10 and 21.5 degrees C. Influent solution was spiked to 30 mg L-1 NO3-N, 2-8x10(5) E. coli and Salmonella, and 0.1 mg L-1 DRP. Microbial removal was consistently observed with removal ranging from 75 to 78% reduction at 10 degrees C and 90-96% at 21.5 degrees C. The concentration reduction ranged from 2.75 to 9.03x10(4) for both organisms. HRT had less impact on microbial removal than temperature and thus further investigation of removal under lower HRTs is warranted. Nitrate concentrations averaged 96% reduction (with load removal of 14.6 g Nm(-3) d(-1)) from 21.5 degrees C columns at 24 HRT and 29% reduction (with load removal of 8.8 g Nm(-3) d(-1)) from 10 degrees C columns at 12 HRT. DRP removal was likely temporary due to microbial uptake. While potential for removal of E. coli and Salmonella by woodchip bioreactors is demonstrated, system design will need to be considered. High concentrations of these microbial contaminants are likely to occur during peak flows, when bypass flow may be occurring. The results of this study show that woodchip bioreactors operated for nitrate removal have a secondary benefit through the removal of enteric bacteria.

AB We theoretically investigate the dynamical stability of one-dimensional fullerene polymers by computing the phonon dispersion relations within the atomistic approach. We find that only seven models among 54 models proposed previously (Noda et al., 2015) are dynamically stable. We show that the low temperature specific heat of them is proportional to the square root of the temperature in a wider range of temperature compared to the case of single-walled carbon nanotubes.

AB Single crystals of the lead-free double perovskite Cs2BiAgBr6 were grown from supersaturated solution. According to characterization by XRD and EBSD methods the perovskite's crystals are of the cubic Fm-3m symmetry with the lattice constant a = 11.20 angstrom. DFT calculations based on the determined crystal structure reveal that the perovskite is an indirect band gap semiconductor. The recorded low temperature (1.4 K) photoluminescence spectra demonstrate three bands. With help of the ab initio quantum-chemical modeling, the two energetically lowest bands of the spectra we assign to indirect transitions. The third band in our opinion corresponds to the direct band-to-band transition. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB OCS is an ideal probe for quantum solvation effects in cold helium clusters. He-2-OCS is the "second step" in going from a single OCS molecule to a large doped superfluid helium cluster. Here assignment of the spectrum of He-2-OCS is significantly extended to higher values of J, K, and v(t) (the low frequency torsional vibration). The observation of a new infrared band, OCS nu(1) + nu(3), taken together with the known nu(1) band, enables assignments to be verified by comparing ground state combination differences. Relatively straightforward scaling of previously calculated theoretical energy levels gives a remarkably good fit to experiment. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Also, the [Re(bpyac)(CO)(3)Cl] rhenium(I) complex for chemical anchorage was analyzed. The characterization of TiO2/Ru(II) and TiO2/Re(I) nanocomposite films was performed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), electron dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and Raman spectroscopy. In addition, for the more stable nanocomposites obtained, the catalytic properties (solar energy conversion and CO2 reduction) were evaluated. The efficiency improvement in redox process derived from the (photo)electrochemical evidence indicates that modified nanoporous TiO2 structures enhance the rate of charge transfer reactions.

The complexation of the aromatic ring substituents (-NH2, -OH, -PH2, -SH) in meta-and para-positions with water and the protonation or deprotonation of such groups have a remarkable influence on the S/T gaps, reaching S/T gap variations from 25.7 to 93.7 kJ mol(-1). This variation is linearly related to the binding energy difference of the S/T configurations. Importantly, the triplet and singlet electronic configurations are systematically favored in the protonated and deprotonated forms, respectively, in all cases. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.
