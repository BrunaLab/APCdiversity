AB Kinetic modeling and optimization of sunflower oil methanolysis catalyzed by spherically-shaped CaO/gamma-Al2O3 particles were conducted in batch stirred and packed-bed tubular reactors at 60 degrees C. The proposed three-parameter kinetic model describing the overall reaction with a variable mechanism was successfully applied to both batch and continuous reactions. The process optimization was done using the response surface methodology combined with a central composite design. The obtained optimal catalyst concentration, methanol-to-oil molar ratio and reaction time for the batch reaction were 0.55% (CaO to the oil), 9:1 and 5.22 h, respectively. In the continuous process, the catalyst was highly active stable and slightly leachable during 30 h. The deactivation of the catalyst was due to massive deposition of the organic molecules from the reaction mixture, which sheltered the catalytically active sites on the catalyst surface.

AB In this study for the first time a new air separation unit with a carbon dioxide power cycle based on cold energy recovery of liquefied natural gas is investigated by conventional and advanced exergoeconomic analyses. With conventional exergy analysis, the source of irreversibility in the process can be determined, while with advanced exergy analysis, the real potential can be determined for improving the process operating performance as well as component interactions. The exergy destruction rate and total operating cost are divided into two catagories which are sub-parts of each other: endogenous/exogenous and unavoidable/avoidable. The exergy and exergoeconomic analyses indicate that the total process cost can be decreased by improving the performance and efficiencies of compressors and heat exchangers. This is because these types of process components have the largest and smallest exergoeconomic factor values, respectively. Results of the advanced exergy and exergoeconomic analyses demonstrate that, when considering the avoidable endogenous investment cost rate, compressors have priorities for modification. Also, based on the avoidable endogenous cost rate, one of the heat exchangers should be modified at first. The exergy destruction and investment cost rates in most of the process components are endogenous. A sensitivity analysis is performed to evaluate the effects of economic and thermodynamic parameters on the advanced exergoeconomic parameters. It is concluded that the configuration of the process components has a significant impact on their costs.

AB This study presents two biomass conversion strategies: electrocatalytic glycerol-to-chemicals (eGTC) and catalytic corn stover-to-fuels (cCTF). The effect of process integration combining eGTC with cCTF on a commercial scale is investigated to improve energy efficiency and economics of the strategies. In the integrated process strategy, most of the heat requirements for eGTC are supplied by cCTF, and most of the hydrogen requirements for cCTF are provided by eGTC. Process integration leads to higher energy efficiency (27.6%) of integrated process strategy compared to the eGTC-only process (11.4%). The minimum selling price for the integrated process strategy is estimated to $2.35/kg(GLA) which can be more economically feasible than the eGTC-only process strategy ($2.55/kg(GLA)).

AB Although piezoelectric power generation for pavements is technically feasible, harvesting energy in a stable and efficient manner still presents several challenges. This paper designs and assesses stacked piezoelectric energy harvesting power generation devices for pavements, in which energy output and road coupling are considered. Following corresponding technical specifications, the dimensions of the proposed power generation device are determined, and the unit is assembled for subsequent testing in terms of its electrical energy outputs. The energy outputs are analyzed in various series and parallel configurations of the units, different loads, and frequency conditions. Results indicate that power generation device with the dimension of 100 mm x 100 mm achieves optimal power generation outputs. The electrical output is positively correlated to the number of parallel piezoelectric energy-harvesting units, the magnitude of load, and the frequency of traffic action. The maximum output at the 0.2 MPa load magnitude and 10 Hz load frequency is 0.88 mW, and the corresponding optimum load is 20 k Omega. The maximum output at the 0.7 MPa and 15 Hz load level can reach up to 11.67 mW, and the corresponding optimum load is 10 k Omega. Subsequently, Mechanical Testing and Simulation (MTS) is performed with 40,000 load cycles, and the overall deformation of the power generation device is minimal and the electrical outputs of the piezoelectric energy-harvesting units remain stable. Finally, future research plan is discussed.

AB The catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) is a novel, alternative process for the selective hydrogenation, and the microwave is an effective heating method for organic reaction. In this study, CTH of Jatropha oil biodiesel was performed through the method of microwave heating using Raney-Ni as catalyst and water as solvent. The effect of operating parameters on the composition of upgraded biodiesel was analyzed in detail, and the optimum conditions for CTH of Jatropha oil biodiesel were obtained. Under the optimum conditions, the mass conversion ratio of methyl linoleate reached 91.98 wt% at reaction time of 50 min. For the upgraded biodiesel obtained at 50 min, the methyl linoleate content, the methyl oleate content, the methyl stearate content, and the iodine value were 2.45 wt%, 76.70 wt%, 8.45 wt%, and 70.21, respectively. The experimental data of CTH of Jatropha oil biodiesel under microwave heating were well described by pseudo-first order kinetic model, and the kinetic rate constants and the selectivity of CTH were gained. In view of high selectivity and high reaction rate, CTH using microwave energy as heating source, Raney-Ni as catalyst and water as solvent was found to be an effective approach for the catalytic upgrading of Jatropha oil biodiesel.

AB In a municipal wastewater treatment plant, the anaerobic digesters are able to support the whole or a portion of the required fuel to offset the energy demand. Also, by implementing some techniques on municipal sewage sludge, leading to biomethane productivity enhancement, it is possible to generate surplus power. In this work, using batch biomethane potential assays, thermal pretreatment at 70 degrees C & 90 degrees C for the durations of 0.5 h, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, and 4 h, and digestion temperature rise from the mesophilic to the thermophilic conditions have been studied to boost the biomethane productivity of the sewage sludge. Also a combined cooling, heat, and power generating plant was suggested to evaluate the techniques thermo-economically. It was shown that, compared to the non-treated mesophilic digestion of the sewage sludge, thermal pretreatment at 70 degrees C and 90 degrees C for 0.5 h, and thermophilic digestion were able to raise the biomethane productivity by 13.63%, 29.82%, and 160.8%, respectively. In this regard, the thermodynamic and the thermo- economic model of the plant was developed. The energy analysis of the system revealed that not only the studied methods, but also the mesophilic digestion of the non-treated sewage sludge result in a positive energy recovery balance in the plant. The exergo-economic analysis indicated that the major origin of cost in the system is the anaerobic digester. Implementing thermal pretreatment at 90 degrees C for 30 min and digestion temperature rise led to decrease in the required volume of the digester, and subsequently, in the total system cost rate. Additionally, all the applied techniques provided more fuel compared to the non-treated mesophilic case, and consequently they could reduce the levelized cost of energy in the plant. Among the studied techniques, the most effective one was digestion temperature rise which decreased the total cost rate and the levelized cost of energy by 30.31% and 41.29%, respectively.

AB In the present study, the effect of amino acids (viz. methionine, alanine, histidine, cysteine, and lysine) on hydrogen production from organic fraction of municipal solid waste was evaluated using co-culture of E. colt and E. aerogenes. The amino acids were applied in the concentration range of 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, and 10.0 g/L. Modified Gompertz model was used to analyze cumulative hydrogen production (P), maximum hydrogen production rate (Rmax) and lag phases (lambda). The results exhibited that the hydrogen production was positively affected by each amino acid at every concentration applied. Application of alanine resulted in the highest cumulative hydrogen production and volumetric yield of 685.4 +/- 10.1 mL and 1.9561 L-H2/L-substrate, respectively. Amino acid supplementation resulted in the increase of hydrogen yield by 87.7%, 126.6%, 75.5%, 108.7% and 101.7%, respectively by addition of methionine, alanine, histidine, cysteine, and lysine as compared to control. COD removal and VFA generation were positively affected by amino acid addition.

AB The operating strategy can affect the optimal solution and performance of a polygeneration energy system. In this study, the effect of operating strategies: following thermal load; following electric load; and modified base load on the optimal solution of a polygeneration system for a residential building complex in the northern part of Italy is investigated.
   For the optimal solutions, a comparative analysis is carried out considering the techno-economic and environmental performance of the system. The result elaborates on how the benefits achieved in a polygeneration system are influenced by the choice of operating strategy.
   In the building complex, implementation of the operating strategies shows considerable energetic, economic and environmental benefits compared to conventional separate heat and power generation. The ranges of annualized total cost reduction of 17-19%, carbon dioxide emission reduction of 35-43% and fuel consumption reduction of 30-38% are achieved for the various operating strategies. However, each of the operating strategies has its own advantages and drawbacks which emphasizes the importance of post-processing of the results in order to make the right choice. For example, the following thermal load shows the advantage of a higher carbon dioxide emission reduction. On the other hand, one drawback is its lower self-sustainability in terms of electric power compared to the other strategies.

AB The possibilities of recovering waste heat from the exhaust gas and other waste heat sources from a 900 kW fast passenger ferry Diesel engine by means of an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) were investigated. The recovered energy is to be used in a parallel hybrid powertrain, which would allow for electric propulsion and thus low emissions near stopovers while electricity generated by the ORC when the engine is running at cruising speed is stored in a battery. The benefit of such a solution is that there would be no extra load on the engine and increased fuel consumption while the local emissions around the stopovers could be reduced, which is especially desirable in urban environments. Simple organic Rankine-cycles with and without internal energy regeneration and an organic Rankine cycle with two different heat sources have been modelled. Different working fluid candidates have been compared by means of a simple optimization routine with respect to the maximum recoverable amount of work from the cycles' expander. The method is applied to a vessel serving a typical short fast passenger ferry route between the harbour of the Western Norwegian city of Bergen and the neighbouring Asko), municipality.

AB In this paper, the potential of a small scale concentrated solar Organic Rankine Cycle unit coupled with an absorption chiller for trigeneration purposes is investigated using a simulation analysis.
   At the moment, only few research works encompass small-scale solar trigeneration systems and most of them do not refer to real plant. On the contrary, in this work electric, heating and cooling maximum generation of a real and experimental small scale prototype system composed of a 50 m(2) CPC solar field, a 3.5 kWe ORC plant and a 17 kWc absorption chiller is investigated by means of TRNSYS. In particular, this work relies on the evaluation of the dynamic performance of the mentioned plant varying some selected system parameters to provide proper modifications of its design configuration and operation.
   More precisely, working temperature ranges, heating and intermediate fluid flow rates as well as volume of the storage tanks and size of the solar field have been varied within the simulation model. Results have shown that operating temperature ranges of the storage tanks considerably affect the overall performance of the system; by appropriately choosing these ranges the primary energy production can be increased by 6.5% compared to the baseline configuration without any additional investment costs. Moreover, setting suitably some design parameters can significantly contribute to extend the operating hours and the feasibility of a such small scale integrated system for residential applications.

AB A systematic multi-step method was developed for selection of the best working fluid(s) for the simple and regenerative Brayton cycles. The first step of the method involves development of the thermodynamic model of a cycle and development of theoretical expressions for its thermodynamic performance (thermal efficiency and net specific work output). In the second step, parametric calculations were performed for nine working fluids over a range of cycle operating conditions corresponding to the concentrated solar power plants (CSPs) to determine the effect of cycle operating conditions and thermo-physical properties of the working fluids on cycle performance.
   The statistical regression analysis is used in the third step to develop correlations for the cycle efficiency and net specific work of the same form as theoretical expressions developed in Step 1. The last step in the process involves construction of performance maps, where performance parameters, such as thermal efficiency and net specific work output are presented as functions of the cycle operating conditions. The performance map for thermal efficiency shows that, depending on the operating conditions, either N-2 or CO2 are the best choices of the working fluids. However, considering the net specific work output, He is the best working fluid over the entire analyzed range of the cycle operating conditions.

AB A Carnot-type engine with a changing phase working fluid is modelled and optimized. The engine is externally heated by a waste heat in order to valorize it. The waste heat is a flue gas at 350 degrees C, corresponding to a usual temperature of industrial furnace effluents. The objective function is the maximization of the net power output. In the numerical application, the working fluid is water. The optimization variables are the working fluid temperature of vaporization, its temperature of condensation and the allocation of a total thermal transfer area between the boiler and the condenser. This article aims to define an upper bound for waste heat to power conversion, depending on the waste heat temperature and its available mass flow rate, on the working fluid used and on the exchangers' size. The methodology used can be applied to optimize other externally heated engines. Different control volumes are selected for the analysis: the adiabatic converter, the non-adiabatic converter, the system (the converter and the exchangers) and the system placed in the environment. The impact of the choice of the control volume on optimization results, global efficiency and entropy production is studied. It appears that the optimal heating and cooling temperatures are the same in all sub-systems, but the optimal allocation of the total thermal transfer area differs slightly. However, in all cases the optimal condenser thermal transfer area is larger than the optimal boiler thermal transfer area. This imbalance corresponds to the need to evacuate the mechanical energy degradation into heat. It also appears that the control volume increase implies a decrease of the first law efficiency. The entropy analysis allows an identification and a quantification of the different contributions to entropy production. Then, a sensitivity analysis to the relevant parameters is carried out. The relevant parameters are the heating fluid temperature and mass flow rate, the total thermal transfer area, the compressor efficiency and the turbine efficiency.

AB Several criteria have been used in the literature to make decision on the relevance/desirability of investing in a given energy production project. Some investors are interested on projects providing, at the end, a sufficient amount of benefits while in countries where the initial investment is crucial, the rapidity to get back the initial investment is an important criterion for the decision to invest into a project or not. Economic criteria can also allow to rank different projects. Finally they could also help to determine the optimal design of a project/system in order to maximize/minimize the economic returns of the project (benefit, time to get back the initial investment....).
   This paper aims to answer to the following question: under which hypothesis different economic criteria will lead to the same conclusion, that is the same decision concerning investment or the same ranking of different projects or the same optimal design of an energy project. Three concepts of equivalence of economic methods equivalence are introduced, namely the decision making equivalence, the optimal design equivalence and the ranking equivalence. the analysis performed is then applied to optimally design a PV/diesel hybrid power system for a rural area.

AB This article describes the design and commissioning of a micro-combustor for energy recovery from human faeces, which can operate both in updraft and downdraft modes. Energy recovery from faecal matter via thermochemical conversion has recently been identified as a feasible solution for sanitation problems in low income countries and locations of high income countries where access to sewage infrastructures is difficult or not possible. This technology can be applied to waterless toilets with the additional outcome of generating heat and power that can be used to pre-treat the faeces before their combustion and to ensure that the entire system is self-sustaining. The work presented here is framed within the Nano Membrane Toilet (NMT) project that is being carried out at Cranfield University, as part of the Reinvent the Toilet Challenge of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
   For this study, preliminary trials using simulant faeces pellets were first carried out to find out the optimum values for the main operating variables at the scale required by the process, i.e. a fuel flowrate between 0.4 and 1.2 g/min of dry faeces. Parameters such as ignition temperature, residence time, and maximum temperature reached, were determined and used for the final design of the bench-scale combustor prototype. The prototype was successfully commissioned and the first experimental results, using real human faeces, are discussed in the paper.

AB This study compares the techno-economic feasibility of five forest-based biofuel conversion pathways for road transportation in the Nordic countries with particular focus paid to feedstock cost effects on total costs in a partial equilibrium model environment. We present (I) a literature review of techno-economic estimates detailing biofuel costs at various capacities, (II) estimate a capacity-wise normalized cost-comparison of the conversion pathways, and MD estimate the feedstock cost changes with increasing biofuel facility deployment in the Nordic forest Sector Model. The results indicate that fast pyrolysis and hydrothermal liquefaction are the most cost-competitive options among the reviewed conversion pathways. We found average costs of FASTPYR and HTL to range from 0.84(sic) L-1 to 0.91 (sic) L-1 (0.93$ L-1-1.01$ L-1) and 0.84 (sic) L-1 to 0.88 (0.93$ L-1-0.98$ L-1) depending on the techno-economic data used and forest biomass marked demand. Technology learning may reduce these costs further. The conversion pathways are not cost-competitive with current fossil alternatives but may be cost-competitive with current biofuel conversion pathways, given nth plant cost levels. At a biofuel production level corresponding to 20% of the Nordic fossil fuel consumption for road transport, feedstock costs for biofuel producers increases 12-35%, depending on the conversion pathway and the restrictions imposed on what constitutes biofuel feedstock. This corresponds to an increase ranging from 10% to 26% on the total costs. Technology learning may outweigh the effect of feedstock cost increases on the total costs depending on the learning rate and the conversion pathway. The results of this study can potentially aid policy creation for conversion pathway evaluation and support schemes.

AB In a semi-arid to arid climate context, dependency on groundwater resources may lead to overexploitation and deterioration of water quality. The Continental Intercalaire (CI) aquifer is one such continentalscale aquifer (more than a million of km(2)), which is mainly confined, poorly recharged but intensely abstracted. To date, the management of this resource relies on hydrogeological modelling and key parameters such as recharge/discharge rate and groundwater dynamics. We use a combination of residence time indicators (C-14, Cl-36, He-4) and stable isotopes of water (H-2 and O-18) to give greater constraint on the groundwater residence time in the CI. In previous studies, C-14 measurements and steady state modelling indicate a residence time of less than 100 ka whereas in others, Cl-36 measurements and transient scenarios modelling suggest a longer residence time (>500 ka).
   In this study, most of the C-14 measurements are below the limit of detection, establishing residence times greater than 40 ka and confirming the necessity of strict sampling protocols to exclude all air and AMS measurements when low C-14 concentrations are expected.
   In the Tunisian recharge area, detectable C-14 indicate sporadic recharge episodes (3-7 ka and 29-43 ka), whereas He-4 and Cl-36 concentrations in central areas suggest very old (<2 Ma) groundwaters. In these central areas, chlorine concentration can reach more than 2 g/l. Since Cl-36 concentrations are up to 4 time less than the initial input, we are confident there is no excessive deep Cl-36 production.
   We characterise five distinct flowpaths reaching the Tunisian discharge area using their isotopic signatures. According to our mixing model, the average contribution from the main recharge area, the Algerian Atlas Mountains, is around 88%. This value is close to hydrogeological models. Conversely, the contribution from the Dahar Mountains is lower than in the hydrogeological modelling (2% against 10%) whereas the Tinhert shows a greater contribution (10% against 1%).
   Increase of abstraction from the CI can potentially activate the circulation of old brackish groundwaters and dramatically decrease the water quality in the whole system. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The nature of epiphreatic flow remains an important research challenge in karst hydrology. This study focuses on the flood propagation along the epiphreatic system of Reka-Timavo system (Kras/Carso Plateau, Slovenia/Italy). It is based on long-term monitoring of basic physical parameters (pressure/level, temperature, specific electric conductivity) of ground water in six active caves belonging to the flow system. The system vigorously responds to flood events, with stage rising >100 m in some of the caves. Besides presenting the response of the system to flood events of different scales, the work focuses on the interpretation of recorded hydrographs in view of the known distribution and size of conduits and basic hydraulic relations. Furthermore, the hydrographs were used to infer the unknown geometry between the observation points. This way, the main flow restrictors, overflow passages and large epiphreatic storages were identified. The assumptions were tested with a hydraulic model, where the inversion procedure was used for an additional parameter optimisation. Time series of temperature and specific electric conductivity were used to assess the apparent velocities of flow between consecutive points. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Mobile-immobile transport models can be effective in reproducing heavily tailed breakthrough curves of concentration. However, such models may not adequately describe transport along multiple flow paths with intermediate velocity contrasts in connected fields. We propose using the mobile-mobile model for simulating subsurface flow and associated mixing-controlled reactive transport in connected fields. This model includes two local concentrations, one in the fast- and the other in the slow-flow domain, which predict both the concentration mean and variance. The normalized total concentration variance within the flux is found to be a non-monotonic function of the discharge ratio with a maximum concentration variance at intermediate values of the discharge ratio. We test the mobile-mobile model for mixing-controlled reactive transport with an instantaneous, irreversible bimolecular reaction in structured and connected random heterogeneous domains, and compare the performance of the mobile-mobile to the mobile-immobile model. The results indicate that the mobile-mobile model generally predicts the concentration breakthrough curves (BTCs) of the reactive compound better. Particularly, for cases of an elliptical inclusion with intermediate hydraulic-conductivity contrasts, where the travel-time distribution shows bimodal behavior, the prediction of both the BTCs and maximum product concentration is significantly improved. Our results exemplify that the conceptual model of two mobile domains with diffusive mass transfer in between is in general good for predicting mixing-controlled reactive transport, and particularly so in cases where the transfer in the low-conductivity zones is by slow advection rather than diffusion.

AB Vietnam is a country with diverse terrain and climatic conditions and a dependency on hydropower for a significant proportion of its power needs and as such, is particularly vulnerable to changes in climate. In this paper we apply SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) derived discharge simulation results coupled with regression analysis to estimate the performance of hydropower plants for Vietnam between 1995 and mid-2014 when both power supply and demand increased rapidly. Our approach is to examine the watershed formed from three large inter-boundary basins: The Red River, the Vietnam Coast and the Lower Mekong River, which have a total area of 977,964 km(2). We then divide this area into 7,887 sub-basins with an average area of 131.6 km(2) (based on level 12 of HydroSHEDS/HydroBASINS datasets) and 53,024 Hydrological Response Units (HRUs). Next we simulate river flow for the 40 largest hydropower plants across Vietnam. Our validation process demonstrates that the simulated flows are significantly correlated with the gauged inflows into these dams and are able to serve as a good proxy for the inflows into hydropower dams in our baseline energy regression, which captures 87.7% of the variation in monthly power generation. In other results we estimate that large dams sacrifice on average around 18.2% of their contemporaneous production for the purpose of flood control. When we assess Vietnam's current alignment of dams we find that the current cascades of large hydropower dams appear to be reasonably efficient: each MWh/day increase in upstream generation adds 0.146 MWh/day to downstream generation. The study provides evidence for the multiple benefits of a national system of large hydropower dams using a cascade design. Such a system may help overcome future adverse impacts from changes in climate conditions. However, our results show that there is still room for improvement in the harmonization of cascades in some basins. Finally, possible adverse hydro-ecological impacts due to the proliferation of large upstream dams, including those located beyond Vietnam's border, need to be carefully considered.

AB Data assimilation techniques such as the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) are often applied to hydrological models with minimal state volume/capacity constraints enforced during ensemble generation. Flux constraints are rarely, if ever, applied. Consequently, model states can be adjusted beyond physically reasonable limits, compromising the integrity of model output. In this paper, we investigate the effect of constraining the EnKF on forecast performance. A "free run" in which no assimilation is applied is compared to a completely unconstrained EnKF implementation, a 'typical' hydrological implementation (in which mass constraints are enforced to ensure non-negativity and capacity thresholds of model states are not exceeded), and then to a more tightly constrained implementation where flux as well as mass constraints are imposed to force the rate of water movement to/from ensemble states to be within physically consistent boundaries. A three year period (2008-2010) was selected from the available data record (1976-2010). This was specifically chosen as it had no significant data gaps and represented well the range of flows observed in the longer dataset. Over this period, the standard implementation of the EnKF (no constraints) contained eight hydrological events where (multiple) physically inconsistent state adjustments were made. All were selected for analysis. Mass constraints alone did little to improve forecast performance; in fact, several were significantly degraded compared to the free run. In contrast, the combined use of mass and flux constraints significantly improved forecast performance in six events relative to all other implementations, while the remaining two events showed no significant difference in performance. Placing flux as well as mass constraints on the data assimilation framework encourages physically consistent state estimation and results in more accurate and reliable forward predictions of streamflow for robust decision-making. We also experiment with the observation error, which has a profound effect on filter performance. We note an interesting tension exists between specifying an error which reflects known uncertainties and errors in the measurement versus an error that allows "optimal" filter updating.

AB Hydrological processes regulating sediment transport from land to sea have been widely studied. However, anthropogenic factors controlling the river flow-sediment regime and subsequent response of the estuary are still poorly understood. Here we conducted a multi-timescale analysis on flow and sediment discharges during the period 1967-2014 for the two tributaries of the Jiulong River in Southeast China. The long-term flow-sediment relationship remained linear in the North River throughout the period, while the linearity showed a remarkable change after 1995 in the West River, largely due to construction of dams and reservoirs in the upland watershed. Over short timescales, rainstorm events caused the changes of suspended sediment concentration (SSC) in the rivers. Regression analysis using synchronous SSC data in a wet season (2009) revealed a delayed response (average 5 days) of the estuary to river input, and a box-model analysis established a quantitative relationship to further describe the response of the estuary to the river sediment input over multiple timescales. The short-term response is determined by both the vertical SSC-salinity changes and the sediment trapping rate in the estuary. However, over the long term, the reduction of riverine sediment yield increased marine sediments trapped into the estuary. The results of this study indicate that human activities (e.g., dams) have substantially altered sediment delivery patterns and river-estuary interactions at multiple timescales.

AB Groundwater and surface-water interactions are regulated by catchment characteristics and complex inter- and intra-annual variations in climatic conditions that are not yet fully understood. Our objective was to investigate the influence of catchment characteristics and freeze-thaw processes on surface and groundwater interactions in a boreal landscape, the Krycklan catchment in Sweden. We used a numerical modelling approach and sub-catchment evaluation method to identify and evaluate fundamental catchment characteristics and processes. The model reproduced observed stream discharge patterns of the 14 sub-catchments and the dynamics of the 15 groundwater wells with an average accumulated discharge error of 1% (15% standard deviation) and an average groundwater-level mean error of 0.1 m (0.23 m standard deviation). We show how peatland characteristics dampen the effect of intense rain, and how soil freeze-thaw processes regulate surface and groundwater partitioning during snowmelt. With these results, we demonstrate the importance of defining, understanding and quantifying the role of landscape heterogeneity and sub-catchment characteristics for accurately representing catchment hydrological functioning.

AB Thawing permafrost on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) has great impacts on the local hydrological process by way of causing ground ice to thaw. Until now there is little knowledge on ground ice hydrology near permafrost table under a warming climate. This study applied stable tracers (isotopes and chloride) and hydrograph separation model to quantify the sources of ground ice near permafrost table in continuous permafrost regions of the central QTP. The results indicated that the ground ice near permafrost table was mainly supplied by active layer water and permafrost water, accounting for 58.9 to 87.0% and 13.0 to 41.1%, respectively, which implying that the active layer was the dominant source. The contribution rates from the active layer to the ground ice in alpine meadow (59 to 69%) was less than that in alpine steppe (70 to 87%). It showed well-developed hydrogeochemical depth gradients, presenting depleted isotopes and positive chemical gradients with depth within the soil layer. The effects of evaporation and freeze-out fractionation on the soil water and ground ice were evident. The results provide additional insights into ground ice sources and cycling near permafrost table in permafrost terrain, and would be helpful for improving process-based detailed hydrologic models under the occurring global warming.

AB Quantifying flow in rivers is fundamental to assessments of water supply, water quality, ecological conditions, hydrological responses to storm events, and geomorphological processes. Image-based surface velocity measurements have shown promise in extending the range of discharge conditions that can be measured in the field. The use of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) in image-based measurements of surface velocities has the potential to expand applications of this method. Thus far, few investigations have assessed this potential by evaluating the accuracy and repeatability of discharge measurements using surface velocities obtained from UAS. This study uses large-scale particle image velocimetry (LSPIV) derived from videos captured by cameras on a UAS and a fixed tripod to obtain discharge measurements at ten different stream locations in Illinois, USA. Discharge values are compared to reference values measured by an acoustic Doppler current profiler, a propeller meter, and established stream gauges. The results demonstrate the effects of UAS flight height, camera steadiness and leveling accuracy, video sampling frequency, and LSPIV interrogation area size on surface velocities, and show that the mean difference between fixed and UAS cameras is less than 10%. Differences between LSPIV-derived and reference discharge values are generally less than 20%, not systematically low or high, and not related to site parameters like channel width or depth, indicating that results are relatively insensitive to camera setup and image processing parameters typically required of LSPIV. The results also show that standard velocity indices (between 0.85 and 0.9) recommended for converting surface velocities to depth-averaged velocities yield reasonable discharge estimates, but are best calibrated at specific sites. The study recommends a basic methodology for LSPIV discharge measurements using UAS that is rapid, cost-efficient, and does not require major preparatory work at a measurement location, pre- and post-processing of imagery, or extensive background in image analysis and PIV.

AB Streamflow and sediment loads undergo remarkable changes in worldwide rivers in response to climatic changes and human interferences. Understanding their variability and the causes is of vital importance regarding river management. With respect to the Changjiang River (CJR), one of the largest river systems on earth, we provide a comprehensive overview of its hydrological regime changes by analyzing long time series of river discharges and sediment loads data at multiple gauge stations in the basin downstream of Three Gorges Dam (TGD). We find profound river discharge reduction during flood peaks and in the wet-to-dry transition period, and slightly increased discharges in the dry season. Sediment loads have reduced progressively since 1980s owing to sediment yield reduction and dams in the upper basin, with notably accelerated reduction since the start of TGD operation in 2003. Channel degradation occurs in downstream river, leading to considerable river stage drop. Lowered river stages have caused a 'draining effect' on lakes by fostering lake outflows following TGD impoundments. The altered river-lake interplay hastens low water occurrence inside the lakes which can worsen the drought given shrinking lake sizes in long-term. Moreover, lake sedimentation has decreased since 2002 with less sediment trapped in and more sediment flushed out of the lakes. These hydrological changes have broad impacts on river flood and drought occurrences, water security, fluvial ecosystem, and delta safety. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A new framework model is presented in this study for sharing of water in a river basin using certain governing variables, in an effort to enhance the objectivity for a reasonable and equitable allocation of water among co-basin states. The governing variables were normalised to reduce the governing variables of different co-basin states of a river basin on same scale. In the absence of objective methods for evaluating the weights to be assigned to co-basin states for water allocation, a framework was conceptualised and formulated to determine the normalised weighting factors of different co-basin states as a function of the governing variables. The water allocation to any co-basin state had been assumed to be proportional to its struggle for equity, which in turn was assumed to be a function of the normalised discontent, satisfaction, and weighting factors of each co-basin state. System dynamics was used effectively to represent and solve the proposed model formulation. The proposed model was successfully applied to the Vamsadhara river basin located in the South-Eastern part of India, and a sensitivity analysis of the proposed model parameters was carried out to prove its robustness in terms of the proposed model convergence and validity over the broad spectrum values of the proposed model parameters. The solution converged quickly to a final allocation of 1444 million cubic metre (MCM) in the case of the Odisha co-basin state, and to 1067 MCM for the Andhra Pradesh co-basin state. The sensitivity analysis showed that the proposed model's allocation varied from 1584 MCM to 1336 MCM for Odisha state and from 927 to 1175 MCM for Andhra, depending upon the importance weights given to the governing variables for the calculation of the weighting factors. Thus, the proposed model was found to be very flexible to explore various policy options to arrive at a decision in a water sharing problem. It can therefore be effectively applied to any trans-boundary problem where there is conflict about water-sharing among co-basin states. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The Nile Delta is essential to Egypt's agro- and socio-economy. Although surface water is the traditional source for Egypt's irrigation, the shallow fresh groundwater resources underlying the delta are increasingly burdened by groundwater pumping, which increases interest in the status of the groundwater resources. Groundwater up to three times more saline than sea water was found at 600 m depth. The occurrence of this hypersaline groundwater raises doubts on the often-made assumption in the literature that seawater is the only source of salt in the Nile Delta aquifer and makes further investigation necessary. Knowledge on the origin of this hypersaline groundwater is key in assessing the possibility of deep fresh groundwater pockets. In this paper we conducted computational analyses to assess possible origins using both analytical solutions and numerical models. It is concluded that the hypersaline groundwater can either originate from Quaternary free convection systems, or from compaction-induced upward salt transport of hypersaline groundwater that formed during the Messinian salinity crisis. Our results also indicate that with groundwater dating it is possible to discriminate between these two hypotheses. Furthermore, it is deduced that the hydrological connection between aquifer and sea is crucial to the hydrogeological functioning of the Nile Delta Aquifer. (C) 2018 The Author(s).

AB Bias correction is usually implemented prior to using climate model outputs for impact studies. However, bias correction methods that are commonly used treat climate variables independently and often ignore inter-variable dependencies. The effects of ignoring such dependencies on impact studies need to be investigated. This study aims to assess the impacts of correcting the inter-variable correlation of climate model outputs on hydrological modeling. To this end, a joint bias correction (JBC) method which corrects the joint distribution of two variables as a whole is compared with an independent bias correction (IBC) method; this is considered in terms of correcting simulations of precipitation and temperature from 26 climate models for hydrological modeling over 12 watersheds located in various climate regimes. The results show that the simulated precipitation and temperature are considerably biased not only in the individual distributions, but also in their correlations, which in turn result in biased hydrological simulations. In addition to reducing the biases of the individual characteristics of precipitation and temperature, the JBC method can also reduce the bias in precipitation-temperature (P-T) correlations. In terms of hydrological modeling, the JBC method performs significantly better than the IBC method for 11 out of the 12 watersheds over the calibration period. For the validation period, the advantages of the JBC method are greatly reduced as the performance becomes dependent on the watershed, GCM and hydrological metric considered. For arid/tropical and snowfall-rainfall-mixed watersheds, JBC performs better than IBC. For snowfall- or rainfall-dominated watersheds, however, the two methods behave similarly, with IBC performing somewhat better than JBC. Overall, the results emphasize the advantages of correcting the P-T correlation when using climate model-simulated precipitation and temperature to assess the impact of climate change on watershed hydrology. However, a thorough validation and a comparison with other methods are recommended before using the JBC method, since it may perform worse than the IBC method for some cases due to bias nonstationarity of climate model outputs.

AB Over the past few decades, urban floods have been gaining more attention due to their increase in frequency. To provide reliable flooding predictions in urban areas, various numerical models have been developed to perform high-resolution flood simulations. However, the use of high-resolution meshes across the whole computational domain causes a high computational burden. In this paper, a 2D control-volume and finite-element flood model using adaptive unstructured mesh technology has been developed. This adaptive unstructured mesh technique enables meshes to be adapted optimally in time and space in response to the evolving flow features, thus providing sufficient mesh resolution where and when it is required. It has the advantage of capturing the details of local flows and wetting and drying front while reducing the computational cost. Complex topographic features are represented accurately during the flooding process. For example, the high-resolution meshes around the buildings and steep regions are placed when the flooding water reaches these regions.
   In this work a flooding event that happened in 2002 in Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom has been simulated to demonstrate the capability of the adaptive unstructured mesh flooding model. The simulations have been performed using both fixed and adaptive unstructured meshes, and then results have been compared with those published 2D and 3D results. The presented method shows that the 2D adaptive mesh model provides accurate results while having a low computational cost. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Variance analysis of forecasted streamflow maxima in a wet temperate

AB Coupling global climate models, hydrologic models and extreme value analysis provides a method to forecast streamflow maxima, however the elusive variance structure of the results hinders confidence in application. Directly correcting the bias of forecasts using the relative change between forecast and control simulations has been shown to marginalize hydrologic uncertainty, reduce model bias, and remove systematic variance when predicting mean monthly and mean annual streamflow, prompting our investigation for maxima streamflow. We assess the variance structure of streamflow maxima using realizations of emission scenario, global climate model type and project phase, downscaling methods, bias correction, extreme value methods, and hydrologic model inputs and parameterization. Results show that the relative change of streamflow maxima was not dependent on systematic variance from the annual maxima versus peak over threshold method applied, albeit we stress that researchers strictly adhere to rules from extreme value theory when applying the peak over threshold method. Regardless of which method is applied, extreme value model fitting does add variance to the projection, and the variance is an increasing function of the return period. Unlike the relative change of mean streamflow, results show that the variance of the maxima's relative change was dependent on all climate model factors tested as well as hydrologic model inputs and calibration. Ensemble projections forecast an increase of streamflow maxima for 2050 with pronounced forecast standard error, including an increase of +30 (+/- 21), +38(+/- 34) and +51(+/- 85)% for 2, 20 and 100 year streamflow events for the wet temperate region studied. The variance of maxima projections was dominated by climate model factors and extreme value analyses. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Stemflow, despite being a small proportion of gross rainfall, is an important and understudied flux of water in forested areas. Recent studies have highlighted its complexity and relative importance for understanding soil and groundwater recharge. Stemflow dynamics offer an insight into how rain water is stored and released from the stems of trees to the soil. Past attempts have been made to understand the variability of stemflow under different types of vegetation, but rather few studies have focused on the combined influence of biotic and abiotic factors on inter and intra-storm stemflow variability, and none in Mediterranean climates. This study presents stemflow data collected at high temporal resolution for two species with contrasting canopies and bark characteristics: Quercus pubescens Willd. (downy oak) and Pinus sylvestris L. (Scots pine) in the Vallcebre research catchments (NE of Spain, 42 degrees 12'N, 1 degrees 49'E). The main objective was to understand how the interaction of biotic and abiotic factors affected stemflow dynamics. Mean stemflow production was low for both species (similar to 1% of incident rainfall) and increased with rainfall amount. However, the magnitude of the response depended on the combination of multiple biotic and abiotic factors. Both species produced similar stemflow volumes and the largest differences were found among trees of the same species. The combined analysis of biotic and abiotic factors showed that funneling ratios and stemflow dynamics were highly influenced by the interaction of rainfall intensity and tree size.

AB The Upper Blue Nile basin is considered as the lifeline for similar to 250 million people and contributes similar to 50 Gm(3)/ year of water to the Nile River. Poor land management practices in the Ethiopian highlands have caused a significant amount of soil erosion, thereby threatening the productivity of the Ethiopian agricultural system, degrading the health of the aquatic ecosystem, and shortening the life of downstream reservoirs. The Upper Blue Nile basin, because of limited research and availability of data, has been considered as the "great unknown." In the recent past, however, more research has been published. Nonetheless, there is no state-of-the-art review that presents research achievements, gaps and future directions. Hence, this paper aims to bridge this gap by reviewing the advances in water resources research in the basin while highlighting research needs and future directions. We report that there have been several research projects that try to understand the biogeochemical processes by collecting information on runoff, groundwater recharge, sediment transport, and tracers. Different types of hydrological models have been applied. Most of the earlier research used simple conceptual and statistical approaches for trend analysis and water balance estimations, mainly using rainfall and evapotranspiration data. More recent research has been using advanced semi-physically/physically based distributed hydrological models using high resolution temporal and spatial data for diverse applications. We identified several research gaps and provided recommendations to address them. While we have witnessed advances in water resources research in the basin, we also foresee opportunities for further advancement. Incorporating the research findings into policy and practice will significantly benefit the development and transformation agenda of the Ethiopian government. (C) 2018 The Authors.

AB Existing closed-form solutions of contaminant transport problems are limited by the mathematically convenient assumption of uniform flow. These solutions cannot be used to investigate contaminant transport in coastal aquifers where seawater intrusion induces a variable velocity field. An adaptation of the Fourier-Galerkin method is introduced to obtain semi-analytical solutions for contaminant transport in a confined coastal aquifer in which the saltwater wedge is in equilibrium with a freshwater discharge flow. Two scenarios dealing with contaminant leakage from the aquifer top surface and contaminant migration from a source at the landward boundary are considered. Robust implementation of the Fourier-Galerkin method is developed to efficiently solve the coupled flow, salt and contaminant transport equations. Various illustrative examples are generated and the semi-analytical solutions are compared against an in-house numerical code. The Fourier series are used to evaluate relevant metrics characterizing contaminant transport such as the discharge flux to the sea, amount of contaminant persisting in the groundwater and solute flux from the source. These metrics represent quantitative data for numerical code validation and are relevant to understand the effect of seawater intrusion on contaminant transport. It is observed that, for the surface contamination scenario, seawater intrusion limits the spread of the contaminant but intensifies the contaminant discharge to the sea. For the landward contamination scenario, moderate seawater intrusion affects only the spatial distribution of the contaminant plume while extreme seawater intrusion can increase the contaminant discharge to the sea. The developed semi-analytical solution presents an efficient tool for the verification of numerical models. It provides a clear interpretation of the contaminant transport processes in coastal aquifers subject to seawater intrusion. For practical usage in further studies, the full open source semi-analytical codes are made available at the website https://lhyges.unistra.fr/FAHS-Marwan. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Atmospheric evaporative demand can be used as a measure of the hydrological cycle and the global energy balance. Its long-term variation and the role of driving climatic factors have received increasingly attention in climate change studies. FAO-Penman-Monteith reference crop evapotranspiration rates were estimated for 644 meteorological stations over China for the period 1960-2011 to analyze spatial and temporal attribution variability. Attribution of climatic variables to reference crop evapotranspiration rates was not stable over the study period. While for all of China the contribution of sunshine duration remained relatively stable, the importance of relative humidity increased considerably during the last two decades, particularly in winter. Spatially distributed attribution analysis shows that the position of the center of maximum contribution of sunshine duration has shifted from Southeast to Northeast China while in West China the contribution of wind speed has decreased dramatically. In contrast relative humidity has become an important factor in most parts of China. Changes in the Asian Monsoon circulation may be responsible for altered patterns of cloudiness and a general decrease of wind speeds over China. The continuously low importance of temperature confirms that global warming does not necessarily lead to rising atmospheric evaporative demand. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID POINT RAINFALL; FREQUENCY; TRANSFORMATION; THRESHOLDS; DERIVATION
AB For the study and modeling of hydrological phenomena, both in urban and rural areas, a proper estimation of the areal reduction factor (ARF) is crucial. In this paper, we estimated the ARF from observed rainfall data as the ratio between the average rainfall occurring in a specific area and the point rainfall. Then, we compared the obtained ARF values with some of the most widespread empirical approaches in literature which are used when rainfall observations are not available. Results highlight that the literature formulations can lead to a substantial over- or underestimation of the ARF estimated from observed data. These findings can have severe consequences, especially in the design of hydraulic structures where empirical formulations are extensively applied. The aim of this paper is to present a new analytical relationship with an explicit dependence on the rainfall duration and area that can better represent the ARF-area trend over the area case of study. The analytical curve presented here can find an important application to estimate the ARF values for design purposes. The test study area is the Lazio Region (central Italy). (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Lake Hayward is one of only about 30 hypersaline lakes worldwide that is meromictic and heliothermal and as such behaves as a natural salt gradient solar pond. Lake Hayward acts as a local groundwater sink, resulting in seasonally variable hypersaline lake water with total dissolved solids (TDS) in the upper layer (mixolimnion) ranging between 56 kg m(-3) and 207 kg m(-3) and the deeper layer (monimolimnion) from 153 kg m(-3) to 211 kg m(-3). This is up to six times the salinity of seawater and thus has the highest salinity of all eleven lakes in the Yalgorup National Park lake system. A program of continuously recorded water temperature profiles has shown that salinity stratification initiated by direct rainfall onto the lake's surface and local runoff into the lake results in the onset of heliothermal conditions within hours of rainfall onset.
   The lake alternates between being fully mixed and becoming thermally and chemically stratified several times during the annual cycle, with the longest extended periods of heliothermal behaviour lasting 23 and 22 weeks in the winters of 1992 and 1993 respectively. The objective was to quantify the heat budgets of the cyclical heliothermal behaviour of Lake Hayward.
   During the period of temperature profile logging, the maximum recorded temperature of the monimolimnion was 42.6 degrees C at which time the temperature of the mixolimnion was 29.4 degrees C.
   The heat budget of two closed heliothermal cycles initiated by two rainfall events of 50 mm and 52 mm in 1993 were analysed. The cycles prevailed for 11 and 20 days respectively and the heat budget showed net heat accumulations of 34.2 MJ m(-3) and 15.4 MJ m(-3), respectively. The corresponding efficiencies of lake heat gain to incident solar energy were 0.17 and 0.18 respectively. Typically, artificial salinity gradient solar ponds (SGSP) have a solar radiation capture efficiencies ranging from 0.10 up to 0.30. Results from Lake Hayward have implications for comparative biogeochemistry and its characteristics should aid in identification of other hitherto unknown heliothermal lakes.

AB Best management practices (BMPs) are popular approaches used to improve hydrology and water quality. Uncertainties in BMP effectiveness over time may result in overestimating long-term efficiency in watershed planning strategies. To represent varying long-term BMP effectiveness in hydrologic/water quality models, a high level and forward-looking modeling framework was developed. The components in the framework consist of establishment period efficiency, starting efficiency, efficiency for each storm event, efficiency between maintenance, and efficiency over the life cycle. Combined, they represent long-term efficiency for a specific type of practice and specific environmental concern (runoff/pollutant). An approach for possible implementation of the framework was discussed. The long-term impacts of grass buffer strips (agricultural BMP) and bioretention systems (urban BMP) in reducing total phosphorus were simulated to demonstrate the framework. Data gaps were captured in estimating the long-term performance of the BMPs. A Bayesian method was used to match the simulated distribution of long-term BMP efficiencies with the observed distribution with the assumption that the observed data represented long-term BMP efficiencies. The simulated distribution matched the observed distribution well with only small total predictive uncertainties. With additional data, the same method can be used to further improve the simulation results. The modeling framework and results of this study, which can be adopted in hydrologic/water quality models to better represent long-term BMP effectiveness, can help improve decision support systems for creating long-term stormwater management strategies for watershed management projects.

AB In a groundwater flow system, the age of groundwater should gradually increase from the recharge zone to the discharge zone within the same streamline. However, it is occasionally observed that the groundwater age becomes younger in the discharge zone in the piedmont alluvial plain, and the oldest age often appears in the middle of the plain. A new set of groundwater chemistry and isotopes was employed to reassess the groundwater C-14 ages from the discharge zone in the North China Plain (NCP). Carbonate precipitation, organic matter oxidation and cross-flow mixing in the groundwater from the recharge zone to the discharge zone are recognized according to the corresponding changes of HCO3- (or DIC) and delta C-13 in the same streamline of the third aquifer of the NCP. The effects of carbonate precipitation and organic matter oxidation are calibrated with a C-13 mixing model and DIC correction, but these corrected C-14 ages seem unreasonable because they grow younger from the middle plain to the discharge zone in the NCP. The relationship of Cl- content and the recharge distance is used to estimate the expected Cl- content in the discharge zone, and In(a(14)C)/Cl is proposed to correct the a(14)C in groundwater for the effect of cross-flow mixing. The C-14 ages were reassessed with the corrected a(14)C due to the cross-flow mixing varying from 1.25 to 30.58 ka, and the groundwater becomes older gradually from the recharge zone to the discharge zone. The results suggest that the reassessed C-14 ages are more reasonable for the groundwater from the discharge zone due to cross-flow mixing.

DE Lake hydrological network; lake classification; Third pole
ID TIBETAN PLATEAU; ELEVATION CHANGES; EXPANSION; DECADES; BASIN
AB The intensity and form of changes in closed lakes, upstream lakes and outflow lakes on the Third Pole (TP) differ based on their drainage mode. Researchers' insufficient understanding of the hydrological networks associated with lakes hampers studies of the relationship between lakes and climate. In this study, we establish a comprehensive hydrological network for each lake ( > 1 km(2)) on the TP using 106 Landsat images, 236 Chinese topographic maps, and SRTM DEM. Three-hundred-ninety-seven closed lakes, 488 upstream lakes and 317 outflow lakes totaling 3,5498.49 km(2), 7,378.82 km(2), and 3,382.29 km(2), respectively, were identified on the TP using 2010 data. Two-hundred-thirty-four closed lakes were found to not be linked to upstream lakes. The remaining 163 closed lakes were connected to and fed by the 488 upstream lakes. The object-oriented analyses within this study indicated that more rapid changes occurred in the surface extent of closed lakes than in upstream lakes or outflow lakes on the TP from 1970s to 2010. Furthermore, the water volume of the examined closed lakes was almost nine times greater than that of the upstream lakes from 2003 to 2009. All the examined closed lakes exhibited an obvious water volume change compared to the corresponding upstream lakes in the same basin. Furthermore, two case studies illustrate that the annual and seasonal dynamics associated with the changes in closed lakes may reflect climate change patterns, while the upstream lake dynamics may be more controlled by the lakeshore terrain and drainage characteristics. The lake inventory and hydrological network catalogued in this study provide a basis for developing a better understanding of lake response to climate change on the TP.

AB Evapotranspiration (ET) partitioning is a growing field of research in hydrology due to the significant fraction of watershed water loss it represents. The use of tracer-aided models has improved understanding of watershed processes, and has significant potential for identifying time-variable partitioning of evaporation (E) from ET. A tracer-aided model was used to establish a time-series of E/ET using differences in riverine delta O-18 and delta H-2 in four northern Canadian watersheds (lower Nelson River, Manitoba, Canada). On average E/ET follows a parabolic trend ranging from 0.7 in the spring and autumn to 0.15 (three watersheds) and 0.5 (fourth watershed) during the summer growing season. In the fourth watershed wetlands and shrubs dominate land cover. During the summer, E/ET ratios are highest in wetlands for three watersheds (10% higher than unsaturated soil storage), while lowest for the fourth watershed (20% lower than unsaturated soil storage). Uncertainty of the ET partition parameters is strongly influenced by storage volumes, with large storage volumes increasing partition uncertainty. In addition, higher simulated soil moisture increases estimated E/ET. Although unsaturated soil storage accounts for larger surface areas in these watersheds than wetlands, riverine isotopic composition is more strongly affected by E from wetlands. Comparisons of E/ET to measurement-intensive studies in similar ecoregions indicate that the methodology proposed here adequately partitions ET. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.

AB Background: In the spectrum of children with symptomatic sleep disordered breathing (SDB), some individuals - such as those with upper airway resistance syndrome (UARS) - do not have abnormalities on polysomnography (PSG). In this study we have assessed whether assessment of respiratory arrhythmia (RA) and heart rate variability (HRV) analysis helps in management of children with syndromic craniosynostosis and none-to-mild obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). & para;& para;Methods: Prospective cohort study in children aged 1-18 years old with syndromic craniosynostosis. Children were selected for HRV analysis from the ECG if their obstructive apnea-hypopnea index (oAHI) was between zero and five per hour (ie, oAHI <= 5/hour). Subjects were divided into groups based on the presence or absence of respiratory arrhythmia (with or without RA respectively) using the electrocardiogram (ECG). The main analysis included studying the relationship between RA and HRV, symptoms, interventions, and sleep architecture.& para;& para;Results: We identified 42 patients with, at worst, mild OSA. We found higher parasympathetic control and higher total power in children with RA during the non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep. Children with RA also have a relatively higher percentage of paradoxical breathing during non-REM sleep (P = 0.042). Intracranial hypertension was distributed equally between groups. Last, RA patients showed increased parasympathetic activity that further increased in non-REM sleep. & para;& para;Conclusion: In syndromic craniosynostosis cases with SDB and PSG showing oAHI <= 5/hour, the presence of RA may indicate subsequent need for treatment interventions, and a trend toward higher occurrence of clinical symptoms. ECG analyses of HRV variables in subjects with RA demonstrate increased parasympathetic activity and total power. Such findings may add to the diagnosis of apparently asymptomatic children.

AB Background: Media use is increasingly becoming common in preschoolers and starting before the age of three years. While several studies have documented the effects of screen time on sleep duration in this age group, investigations including sleep quality are scarce and mainly cross-sectional. Moreover, they are limited by investigating sleep across broader age ranges or in older preschoolers, which may blur early effects and the ideal time for intervention.& para;& para;Methods: The current study analyzed data from the Ulm SPATZ Health Study, a birth cohort study in which 1006 live newborns were recruited from the general population shortly after delivery at the University Medical Center Ulm, Southern Germany, from April 2012 to May 2013. Longitudinal data on child sleep were parent reported on the Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ) at ages two and three years. Child media consumption was assessed at three years of age with different questions on electronic media and books. Statistical analyses included Kruskal-Wallis tests and multivariable linear and logistic regression models.& para;& para;Results: Electronic media consumption had a moderate prevalence and dose, and prevalence of never using books appeared to be high (39%). The preliminary results indicated strong statistically significant inverse cross-sectional associations between electronic media consumption and overall sleep quality and, using longitudinal data, with worsening indicators of bedtime resistance, sleep anxiety, and daytime sleepiness.& para;& para;Conclusions: This was the first larger-scale study to comprehensively investigate the effects of electronic media consumption and book reading on all CSHQ items in three-year-olds. Considering the risk of chronification, preventive efforts (eg, by effective sleep-oriented training programs) already seem necessary in early life. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID ABRUPT CESSATION; RESTLESS; DISEASE; DOPAMINE; TRAMADOL
AB Introduction: Many patients with opioid use disorder report symptoms similar to restless legs syndrome (RLS) during withdrawal. However, whether these symptoms are true RLS, their predictors and effect of treatment with pregabalin are still unknown.& para;& para;Method: A total of 19 consecutive patients with opioid use disorder who were admitted for detoxification were included in this study after obtaining informed consent. Information regarding addiction was noted, and they were screened for RLS every morning and evening. Patients were also asked to provide information regarding their sleep quality during the previous night. To control opioid withdrawal, they were prescribed buprenorphine. Pregabalin was prescribed to patients who developed RLS. For analysis, patients were divided in two groups: those with RLS and those without RLS.& para;& para;Results: The average age of the subjects included in this study was 30.2 (+/- 10.4) years. Mean duration of substance abuse was 56.8 (+/- 38.4) months. Ten patients developed symptoms of RLS. Groups with RLS and without RLS were comparable with reference to demographics, laboratory parameters, and dose of buprenorphine that was required to control withdrawal symptoms. On average, RLS appeared after 1.7 days of abstinence. Patients described their symptoms such as crawling, creeping sensation in the muscles or "just pain". Eight out of 10 subjects reported symptoms limited to legs; however, two described similar problems in their upper limbs as well. A change in sleep pattern was observed with delayed sleep onset at night, delayed wake time in the morning, and spending a major proportion of day asleep. Pregabalin brought significant relief to the symptoms of RLS and sleep quality.& para;& para;Conclusion: RLS during opioid withdrawal was an independent illness seen in half of the patients. It appeared to be mediated through mu-receptors, with contributions from other factors. Pregabalin improved symptoms of RLS and quality of sleep in these patients. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Background: Sleep restriction therapy (SRT) is a largely untested single treatment component of cognitive-behaviour therapy for insomnia. To date, the evidence for contraindications for SRT is limited to very few studies. The present study investigated the objective and subjective daytime consequences during the acute phase of SRT for adults diagnosed with Chronic Insomnia Disorder. & para;& para;Methods: Sixteen adults (age = 36.3 +/- 13.4 yrs, 12 females, 4 males) underwent SRT for their insomnia over a two week period based on recommendations by Miller and colleagues (2014) [6]. Participants completed sleep diaries, self-reported daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale [ESS]), as well as objective measures of reaction time/inhibition (Go/NoGo task) and driving performance (AusEd driving simulator) at pre-, mid- (ie, after one week of SRT) and post-SRT (after two weeks of SRT).& para;& para;Results: Sleep diary outcomes indicated participants complied with the restriction of time in bed, and that a similar amount of total sleep time (TST) was maintained from pre-to-post-treatment. There was no significant change in daytime sleepiness, and similarly no significant changes observed in objective performance on the Go/NoGo task and AusEd driving simulator.& para;& para;Conclusions: These preliminary results suggest SRT during the acute phase does not appear to place insomnia patients at risk of significant impairments in sleepiness and reaction times. We note these findings can only be translated into clinical practice when sleep duration remains relatively unchanged. Future studies using objective measures of sleep and a control group are recommended. Crown Copyright (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: We aimed to determine napping characteristics of community-dwelling patients with insomnia disorder (ID) compared to characteristics of normal controls (NC), and to examine the effect of napping on nocturnal sleep.& para;& para;Methods: Adult volunteers who were more than 18 years old were recruited from three rural public health centers in Korea. Data from actigraphy recording and a sleep diary filled out for seven days were obtained. Finally, 115 ID patients and 80 NC subjects were included in this study. Parameters and timing of nocturnal sleep and nap were compared between the ID and NC groups. Two-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was performed to determine the effect of ID diagnosis and napping on sleep parameters.& para;& para;Results: Sleep efficiency (SE) in the ID group was significantly lower (p = 0.010), and wake time after sleep onset (WASO) was significantly greater (p = 0.023), compared to the NC group. There was no significant difference in nocturnal sleep or nap timing between the two groups. Nap frequency in the ID group was significantly higher than that in the NC group (p = 0.025). Although ID diagnosis and napping had no independent effect on fragmentation index, their interaction had a significant effect on fragmentation index (p = 0.021). Nap frequency was positively correlated with PSQI score (r = 0.166, p = 0.033).& para;& para;Conclusion: Insomnia patients showed no significant difference in nap timing or nap duration compared to NC subjects. However, insomnia patients showed higher nap frequency. Frequent napping was associated with poorer subjective sleep quality. Therefore, although napping might not have a negative impact on nocturnal sleep maintenance in NC subjects, it did have an effect on nocturnal sleep in insomnia patients. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Background: Childhood sleep habits are associated with mental health development; however, little is known about the impact of irregular bedtimes on the mental health of early school-aged children. The aims of this study were to examine the effect of weekday sleep habits (varying bedtimes depending on the night of the week and later than 22:00 h bedtime) on behavior problems, prosocial behavior, and resilience of children aged 6-7 years.& para;& para;Methods: Data were taken from the Adachi Child Health Impact of Living Difficulty (A-CHILD) study, which involved the participation of 4291 caregivers of first-grade children (6-7 years old) living in Adachi City, Tokyo. Resilience (using the Children's Resilient Coping Scale), behavior problems (using the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire), both modified to range 0-100, and sleep habits were measured via a questionnaire filled out by caregivers. Propensity-score matching was used to determine the associations between irregular and late bedtime, behavior problems, prosocial behavior, and resilience.& para;& para;Results: A total of 320 (7.5%) children showed irregular bedtime on school nights and 540 (13.6%) children went to bed later than 22:00 h. Children with irregular bedtimes on weekdays showed lower resilience (beta = -3.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) = -5.90 to -1.10) and higher levels of behavior problems (beta = 3.29, 95% CI = 1.13-5.46), especially hyperactivity/inattention (beta = 5.76, 95% CI = 2.03 to 9.49) and peer relationship problems (beta = 3.79, 95% CI = 1.02-6.55). On the other hand, no association between bedtime after 22:00 h and resilience or behavior problems was found.& para;& para;Conclusion: Among early school-aged children, irregular bedtime on weekdays may be a risk factor for lower resilience and behavior problems.

AB Background: Although night-shift work (NSW) is associated with a higher risk for several physical and mental disorders, the impact of NSW on pain perception is still unclear. This study investigates the impact of NSW on cold pain perception considering the impact of mood and sleepiness.& para;& para;Method: Quantitative sensory testing (QST) was performed in healthy night-shift workers. Cold pain threshold as well as tonic cold pain was assessed after one habitual night (T1), after a 12-hour NSW (T2) and after one recovery night (T3). Sleep quality was measured with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) before T1, sleepiness with the Stanford Sleepiness Scale (SSS) and mood with a German short-version of the Profile of Mood States (ASTS) at Tl, T2 and T3. Depending on the distribution of the data, ANOVAs or Friedman tests as well as t- or Wilcoxon tests were performed.& para;& para;Results: Nineteen healthy shift-workers (13 females; 29.7 +/- 7.5 years old; 8.1 +/- 6.6 years in shift work, PSQI: 4.7 +/- 2.2) were included. Tonic cold pain showed a significant difference between T1 (48.2 +/- 27.5 mm), T2 (61.7 +/- 26.6 mm; effect size: Cohen's d=.49; percent change 28%), and T3 (52.1 +/- 28.7 mm) on a 0-100 mm Visual Analog Scale (p = 0.007). Cold pain threshold changed from 11.0 +/- 7.9 degrees C (T1) to 14.5 +/- 8.8 degrees C (T2) (p = 0.04), however, an ANOVA comparing T1, T2, and T3 was not significant (p = 0.095). Sleepiness (SSS) and mood (ASTS) changed significantly between T1, T2 and T3 (p-values < 0.01). The change of mood but not of sleepiness correlated with the difference in tonic cold pain from T1 to T2 (R: 0.53; R-2 : 0.29; p = 0.022).& para;& para;Discussion: NSW increases cold pain perception. The same tonic cold pain stimulus is rated 28% more painful after NSW and normalizes after a recovery night. Increases in cold pain perception due to NSW appear to be more strongly related to changes in mood as compared to changes in sleepiness. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID CLINICAL-ASPECTS; NARCOLEPSY; FEATURES
AB Objective: Deep-tendon reflexes are abolished during generalized cataplexy, but whether this is the case in partial cataplexy currently remains unknown. Partial cataplexy may mimic other neurologic/psychiatric phenomena, and knowledge of the reflexes status may provide information for differential diagnosis. We assessed whether deep-tendon reflexes are persistent during partial cataplexy.& para;& para;Methods: Five drug-free patients with typical diagnoses of narcolepsy and clear-cut partial cataplexy were diagnosed in Reference Narcolepsy Centers in France and Italy. Biceps and patellar reflexes were elicited by physicians in charge and video-documented during cataplexy. Reflexes were assessed several times for each patient in different conditions and for various localizations of cataplexy.& para;& para;Results: The absence of tendon reflexes and complete loss of muscle tone during generalized cataplexy was confirmed, but the persistence of those reflexes during several partial cataplectic attacks at different ages, gender, localization of cataplexy (upper limbs, face) and reflexes (biceps, patellar) in drug-naive or withdrawal conditions was documented. & para;& para;Conclusion: The persistence of tendon reflexes during several partial cataplexy episodes contrasts with their absence during generalized cataplexy. This discovery has clinical implications: the persistence of tendon reflexes does not rule out cataplexy diagnosis for partial attacks, whereas their transient abolishment or persistence during generalized attacks indicates cataplexy or pseudocataplexy, respectively.

   DIAGNOSIS
AB Objective: Airway oxidative stress and inflammation are likely to be involved in sleep disordered breathing (SDB) in children. We aimed to measure concentrations of 8-isoprostane (8-IsoP) in the exhaled breath condensate (EBC) and exhaled nitric oxide (FENO) in patients with SBD and healthy children, in order to assess the relationship between these two biomarkers, disease severity, and overnight changes.& para;& para;Methods: Patients with SDB (n = 46) and healthy controls (n = 20) aged 4.5-15.1 years (M/F: 36/30) underwent exhaled measurements. Patients with SDB underwent standard polysomnography to define primary snoring (PS: AHI < 1) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Upon awakening the following morning, FENO was measured and EBC was collected for the measurement of EBC 8-IsoP.& para;& para;Results: OSA patients yielded higher awakening levels of 8-IsoP in EBC than PS patients and control subjects. The 8-IsoP levels, though not FENO , correlated with AHI (r = 0.40, p = 0.003) and SaO2 (r = -0.50, p = 0.001). Cut-off levels of 8-IsoP predicted OSA with a high AUC value (0.84, p = 0.000). Sensitivity and specificity for 8-IsoP levels above the percentile 50 (33.3 pg/mL) were 76.5% and 78.1%, respectively. 8-IsoP levels did not change from the evening to morning session, whereas morning FENO levels rose significantly only in patients with mild OSA (p = 0.03).& para;& para;Conclusion: Levels of 8-IsoP, though not FENO, distinguish children with OSA from those with PS or healthy, correlate with disease severity and closely predict OSA in the whole sample.

ID CIRCADIAN-RHYTHM; SENSORY SYMPTOMS; LOCOMOTION; MOVEMENTS; REFLEXES
AB Objective: To assess if there is a circadian variation in electromyographical (EMG) muscle activity during gait in restless legs syndrome (RLS) patients and healthy control participants.& para;& para;Methods: Gait assessment was done in 14 RLS patients and 13 healthy control participants in the evening (PM) and the morning (AM). Muscle activity was recorded bilaterally from the tibialis anterior (TA), lateral gastrocnemius (GL), rectus femoris (RF) and biceps femoris (BF) muscles.& para;& para;Results: A circadian variation during the stance phase in only TA (PM > AM, p < 0.005) and BF (PM < AM, p = 0.008) activity was observed in control participants. Conversely no circadian variation was seen in any muscles in the RLS patients. RLS patients had an increased TA and GL activity (RLS > Controls, p < 0.05) during early stance and decreased GL activity (RLS < Controls, p < 0.01) during terminal stance in comparison to control participants in the evening. No other significant differences were noted between RLS patients and control participants. Activation of GL during the swing phase was noted in 79% of RLS patients and in 23% of control participants in the morning compared to 71% and 38% in the evening, respectively.& para;& para;Conclusion: EMG muscle activity shows no circadian variation in RLS patients. Evening differences in gait muscle activation patterns between RLS patients and control participants are evident. These results extend our knowledge about alterations in spinal processing during gait in RLS. A possible explanation for these findings is central pattern generator sensitization caused by increased sensitivity in cutaneous afferents in RLS patients. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

DT Article
DE Restless legs syndrome; Adenosine; Dipyridamole; PLMS; Hyperarousal

AB Objectives: Recent animal models of restless legs syndrome (RLS) suggest that brain iron deficiency is associated with a hypoadenosinergic state, with downregulation of adenosine A l receptors (AIR) in the striatum and cortex. We hypothesized that an increase in extracellular adenosine induced by inhibitors of adenosine transporters, such as the non-selective ENT1/ENT2 inhibitor dipyridamole, would result in an improvement in RLS symptoms.& para;& para;Methods: In a prospective two-month open-label, non-placebo controlled clinical trial, 15 untreated idiopathic RLS patients began treatment with 100 mg dipyridamole (with uptitration to 400 mg if necessary). Multiple Suggested Immobilization Tests and polysomnography were performed at baseline and at eight weeks. Severity was assessed at four and eight weeks using the IRLS, and the CGI scales. The primary endpoint was therapeutic response (50% improvement in IRLS total score).& para;& para;Results: Thirteen patients completed the study. IRLS score improved from a mean (+/- S.D.) of 23.4 +/- 4.6 at baseline to 10.7 +/- 4.5 at eight weeks. Six out of 13 patients were full responders and four were partial responders. The mean (+/- S.D.) effective dose of dipyridamole at eight weeks was 281.8 +/- 57.5 mg/day. Sleep variables also improved, and the mean (+/- S.D.) periodic leg movement index decreased from 26.7 +/- 7.2 to 4.3 +/- 1.9. Dipyridamole was generally well tolerated. Main side effects were abdominal cramps, diarrhea, dizziness, and flushing.& para;& para;Conclusions: These preliminary results suggest that dipyridamole has significant therapeutic effects on both sensory and motor symptoms, as well as sleep. In addition, it provides evidence that hypoadenosinergic mechanisms play a central role in RLS.& para;& para;Classification of evidence: The study provides class III evidence supporting the therapeutic effects of dipyridamole in RLS.

AB Objective: The aim of this study was to explore the independent and combined dose-response association of napping and night sleep duration with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) among different genders in the rural Chinese population.& para;& para;Methods: For this research, a total of 19,257 participants were enrolled in the Rural Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle (RuralDiab) study. Napping and night sleep duration were assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Restricted cubic splines and logistic regression were used to estimate the relationship between napping and night sleep duration with T2DM.& para;& para;Results: A linear dose-response relationship between napping duration and T2DM as well as a U-shaped relationship between night sleep duration and T2DM were found. Compared with those who reported no napping, participants who had a napping duration of >= 91 min were associated with a 19% increase in prevalence of T2DM. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) (95% confidence intervals (CIs)) for T2DM were 1.48 (1.03, 2.14) and 1.50 (1.22, 1.85) for shorter (<= 5 h) and longer (>9 h) night sleep duration compared with the referential group. Additionally, the combination of longer napping duration (>= 91 min) and night sleep duration (>9 h) increased 104% (95% CI: 45%, 128%) prevalence for T2DM. These associations were not found in males but were evident in females.& para;& para;Conclusions: Longer napping duration and extreme night sleep duration increased the prevalence of T2DM. Meanwhile, longer napping and night sleep duration might be jointly associated with a higher prevalence of T2DM. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A randomised controlled trial evaluated bright light therapy and morning activity for the treatment of Delayed Sleep-Wake Phase Disorder (DSWPD) in young people. 60 adolescents and young adults (range = 13-24 years, mean = 15.9 +/- 2.2 y, 63% f) diagnosed with DSWPD were randomised to receive three weeks of post-awakening Green Bright Light Therapy (similar to 507 nm) and Sedentary Activity (sitting, watching TV), Green Bright Light Therapy and Morning Activity (standing, playing motion-sensing videogame), Red Light Therapy (similar to 643 nm) and Sedentary Activity or Red Light Therapy and Morning Activity. Sleep (ie sleep onset time, wake up time, sleep onset latency, total sleep time) and daytime functioning (ie morning alertness, daytime sleepiness, fatigue, functional impairment) were measured pre-treatment, post-treatment and at one and three month follow-up. Contrary to predictions, there were no significant differences in outcomes between treatment groups; and interaction effects between treatment group and time for all outcome variables were not statistically significant. However, adolescents and young adults in morning activity conditions did not meaningfully increase their objective activity (ie movement frequency). Overall, adolescents reported significantly improved sleep timing (d = 0.30-0.46), sleep onset latency (d = 0.32) and daytime functioning (d = 0.45-0.87) post-treatment. Improvements in sleep timing (d = 0.53-0.61), sleep onset latency (d = 0.57), total sleep time (d = 0.51), and daytime functioning (d = 0.52-1.02) were maintained, or improved upon, at the three month follow-up. However, relapse of symptomology was common and 38% of adolescents and young adults requested further treatment in addition to the three weeks of light therapy. Although there is convincing evidence for the short-term efficacy of chronobiological treatments for DSWPD, long-term treatment outcomes can be improved. To address this gap in our current knowledge, avenues for future research are discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) is characterized by uncomfortable nocturnal sensations in the legs making sedentary activities and sleep difficult, and is thus linked with psychosocial distress. Due to the symptomatology and neurobiology of RLS (disrupting brain iron and dopamine) it is likely that RLS associates with poorer health-related quality of life (HRQL) and depressive disorder. The objective of this study was to investigate the RLS-HRQL and the RLS-depressive disorder links in a generally healthy population that is not biased by medications. & para;& para;Methods: Complete data, including the Cambridge-Hopkins RLS questionnaire, the 12-item short-form standardized health survey (SF-12), the Major Depression Inventory (MDI), body mass index, smoking status, alcohol consumption, and education were available for 24,707 participants enrolled in the Danish Blood Donor Study from May 1, 2015 to February 1, 2017. Information on quality of sleep was available for all RLS cases. T-tests and multivariable logistic regression models were applied to examine the associations of RLS and MDI scores, and the physical and mental component scores (PCS and MCS) of SF-12, respectively. Analyses were conducted separately for men and women.& para;& para;Results: RLS associated with poorer MCS and poorer PCS. Moreover, Participants with RLS were more likely to classify with depressive disorder. Poor quality of sleep was associated with depressive disorder and poorer MCS among RLS cases, and with poorer PCS in female RLS cases.& para;& para;Conclusion: Thus, we demonstrated that RLS is associated with a significantly lower HRQL and a higher prevalence of depressive disorder among otherwise healthy individuals.

AB Background: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is common in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). SDB is associated with comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and obesity, interplaying with metabolic derangements in the form of uremia, acidosis, and hypervolemia. Renal transplant has been observed to correct most of these metabolic derangements and to control progression of comorbidities. While SDB is highly prevalent among patients in the pretransplant stage, it remains to be seen whether the beneficial aspects of transplant are extended to improvement in SDB in patients with ESRD.& para;& para;Methods: Eighteen patients undergoing thrice-weekly hemodialysis (HD) for ESRD at the transplant clinic of All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, underwent detailed clinical, laboratory, and polysomnographic evaluation. The average number of apneas and hypopneas per hour of sleep, ie, Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI), was used to define the severity of sleep apnea. All patients underwent polysomnography (PSG) within 24 h of the last HD and after three months of living-donor transplant.& para;& para;Results: Of 18 patients, there were 14 males and four females. The median age was 28 years (range 19-50 years). They had already spent a median period of six months (range 3-31 months) on HD before inclusion. The prevalence of SDB (AHI >= 5/h) was 44.4% (8/18) before transplant, which decreased to 5.6% (1/18) after transplant (p = 0.016). The oxygen desaturation index had a median value of 5.8 events/h (range 0.1-35.4) in the pretransplant stage, which decreased to 0 events/h (range 0-6.6) in the post-transplant stage (p = 0.035).& para;& para;Conclusion: There was a significant improvement in the prevalence and severity of SDB after transplant. Whether improvement in SDB is sustained on a long-term follow-up remains to be seen. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Innovation occurs when knowledge about unmet customer needs intersects with knowledge about technological solutions. Both knowledge types are often located outside the firm and need to be absorbed in order for innovation to occur. While there has been extensive research into absorptive capacity for solution knowledge, a necessary complement - absorptive capacity for new customer needs - has been neglected. In an individual level study of 864 employees from a home appliance firm, we show that need absorptive capacity is theoretically and empirically distinct from solution absorptive capacity, and that both are positively associated with employee innovativeness. Interestingly, we find asymmetric extra-domain effects: prior solution knowledge is positively related to need absorptive capacity (cross-pollination effect), while prior need knowledge is negatively related to solution absorptive capacity (attenuation effect). We contrast the cognitive underpinnings of the two absorptive capacity types, contributing to emerging scholarly thinking on the domain-specificity and micro foundations of absorptive capacity.

AB While the importance of a supportive context for entrepreneurship is widely acknowledged, its antecedents are rarely investigated. We apply the concept of organizational climate to higher education institutions and examine the drivers of students' perceptions of the entrepreneurial climate in their university. Combining data from two unique datasets and using multilevel techniques, we analyze the relationship between university characteristics and such climate perceptions of 8009 students at public universities in Germany. We find university entrepreneurship measures to have a positive effect on students' climate perceptions, which also depend on students' background and gender. In addition, we find evidence for different peer effects, depending on students' affinity for entrepreneurship. For the general student population, including entrepreneurship content in their normal studies seems to be required to initiate a social process of sensemaking. However, students' perception of the entrepreneurial climate only depend to a certain degree on intentional entrepreneurship measures. In our study, general university characteristics have the strongest influence on climate perceptions. Overall, our study adds to our understanding of which parameters are important for establishing a more favorable and inspiring climate for becoming an entrepreneur at higher education institutions.

AB This study sheds light on polycentric forms of organizing and corresponding performance implications. Organizations with a polycentric architecture supplement their internal hierarchical decision-making structures with egalitarian, local structures in order to encourage collaboration with legally independent stakeholders. We ground our study on the planning stage for four capital-intensive infrastructure development projects (mega projects) in the UK. We first establish that megaproject planning is carried on by polycentric organizations. We show that in this form of organizing the promoter has decision-making authority over the high-order choices, but shares the authority over the local choices with groups of autonomous stakeholders. We also show how this organizational architecture addresses local disputes and pressures to relax performance targets. Our main contribution is a contingency model that proposes four conditions linking performance to polycentric organizing, whether or not i) the institutional environment empowers an 'umpire' to referee disputes; and ii) the system leader can mobilize substantial slack resources to reconcile conflicting interests. We argue that the four conditions reveal very different classes of managerial problems, and draw implications for practice and policy including but not limited to megaprojects.

AB This paper addresses the question why socio-technical transitions follow similar trajectories in various parts of the world, even though the relevant material preconditions and institutional contexts vary greatly between different regions and countries. It takes a critical stance on the implicit methodological nationalism in transition studies' socio-technical regime concept and proposes an alternative 'global' regime perspective that embraces the increasingly multi-scalar actor networks and institutional rationalities, which influence transition dynamics beyond national or regional borders. By drawing on globalization theories from sociology and human geography, we show that socio-technical systems often develop institutional rationalities that are diffused via international networks and thus become influential in various places around the world. In so doing, we shed light on the multi-scalar interrelatedness of institutional structures and actors in socio-technical systems and elaborate on the implications for the conceptualization of transition dynamics. The paper illustrates this with the case study of an unsuccessful transition in the Chinese wastewater sector. Recent studies indicate that key decisions on wastewater infrastructure expansion were not only influenced by path-dependencies stemming from China's national context, but equally (or even more critically) by the dominant rationality of the water sector's global socio-technical regime. We conclude by discussing the contours of a new research agenda around the notion of global socio-technical regimes.

AB The production of knowledge was subjected to quantitative analysis in the second half of the twentieth century, following Arrow (1962). The determinants of knowledge and the externalities present in the innovation process were discussed with immediate policy influence. In particular, the presence and strength of the spillover of the pool of past knowledge has encouraged high subsidization of R&D in the most developed countries. We survey the empirical literature on the spillover effect in the production of knowledge and implement a meta-analytic regression. We discover that the average spillover effect is less than but close to one and is highly significant. We also find that the spillover effect tends to be greater when the estimation of knowledge production accounts for foreign inputs, and It tends to be lower when the estimation includes only rich economies, regional data are used, and the pool of knowledge is not the patent stock.

AB This paper investigates the link between firm-level innovative performance and innovation prone external environments where knowledgeable individuals tend to cluster. Organizational ambidexterity and absorptive capacities (potential and realized) make it possible for firms to leverage the availability of external knowledge and boost their innovation performance. The empirical analysis focuses on England and is based on a novel combination of Community Innovation Survey (CIS) firm-level data and patent data. The results show that only firms complementing potential and realized absorptive capacities are able to take advantage of favorable external environments by actively combining internal and external sources of knowledge.

AB As a consequence of the patent term harmonization introduced by TRIPS, the term of U.S. patents became contingent on how quickly the patents are granted. We fund that patent applicants strategically responded to this change in incentives. In the pharmaceutical industry, narrower patents with less detailed descriptions allowed applicants to reduce the approval time by 10.8% (170 days). Also consistent with a ticking clock, we find a reduction in the use of continuations across all industries. Our results suggest that the patent term change created long-lasting efficiencies in the patent office.

AB In 2007 Finland changed ownership rights to inventions from its employees - "the professor's privilege" - to universities. We investigate how this change affected academic patenting using new data on inventors and patenting in Finland for the period 1995-2010. Matched sample panel data regressions using difference-in-differences show that patenting by individuals dropped by at least 29 percent after 2007. Unlike other countries studied, in Finland the reform was known before implementation. Adding the period after announcement to the reform period increases the drop in academic patenting to 46 percent. Our and others' results call into question whether the European reform of the professor's privilege were good innovation policy.

AB In this study, we developed Li3PO4-B2O3 glasses doped with different concentrations (0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, and 1.0%) of Ce and studied the optical, dosimetric and scintillation properties. The Ce-doped samples showed scintillation and photoluminescence (PL) due to the 5d-4f transitions of Ce3+ with a broad spectral feature peaking around 350 nm. The scintillation and PL decay times were 55-62 +/- 0.03 as and 29-31 +/- 0.03 ns, respectively. The PL quantum yield (QY) was about 15.3 +/- 2% for the 0.1%-doped sample, and it decreased with increasing the concentration of Ce. The thermally-stimulated luminescence (TSL) was observed in all the samples after irradiating with X-rays, and the 0.1% Ce-doped sample showed the highest sensitivity with the dynamic range confirmed from 0.1 mGy to 10 Gy, which was equivalent to commercial detectors. Moreover, optically-stimulated luminescence (OSL) was observed in the 0.1%Ce-doped sample after X-ray irradiation. Overall, doping with Ce enhanced the PL, scintillation, TSL and OSL properties. The optimal concentration of Ce was 0.1% to be used for radiation detector applications.

AB Resilient poly(urethane urea) aerogels are synthesized from aromatic diisocyanates, aromatic diamines, aliphatic polyols, and a triftmcdonal amine crosslinker. Polyurethane prepolymers are synthesized with isocyanate end groups by reacting the polyol with 4,4'-diphenylmethane diisocyanate in anhydrous N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). The isocyanate-capped polyurethane segments are reacted with 4,4'-oxydianiline to obtain isocyanate end-capped poly(urethane urea) copolymers which are then crosslinked using 1,3,5 triaminophenoxylbenzene (TAB) to obtain the gel networks. The gel networks are tailored by the choice of the polyol and by varying the crosslink density. The gels are dried under supercritical condition after exchanging NMP with acetone and acetone with liquid carbon dioxide. The resulting aerogels show density between 0.20 and 0.35 g/cm(3), porosity between 71 and 85%, and surface area between 47 and 163 m(2)/g. The data suggest that the polyol weight fraction can be used as a parameter to control the shrinkage of aerogel specimens. The shrinkage data also correlate well with the extent of hydrogen bonding involving urea and urethane groups. A reduction of the amount of TAB leads to reduction of the extent of urea hydrogen bonding and an increase of urethane hydrogen bonding. These materials exhibit an onset of thermal decomposition at about 300 degrees C and offer compressive moduli between 12 and 52 MPa. The compressive modulus shows strong dependence on aerogel density.

AB Predicting the dissolution rates of silicate glasses in aqueous conditions is a complex task as the underlying mechanism(s) remain poorly understood and the dissolution kinetics can depend on a large number of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Here, we assess the potential of data-driven models based on machine learning to predict the dissolution rates of various aluminosilicate glasses exposed to a wide range of solution pH values, from acidic to caustic conditions. Four classes of machine learning methods are investigated, namely, linear regression, support vector machine regression, random forest, and artificial neural network. We observe that, although linear methods all fail to describe the dissolution kinetics, the artificial neural network approach offers excellent predictions, even for untrained data, thanks to its inherent ability to handle non-linear data. We further note that the predictive ability of simpler methods, such as linear regression, could be improved using additional physics-based constraints. Such methods, called as physics-informed machine learning can be used to extrapolate the behavior of untrained compositions as well. Overall, we suggest that a more extensive use of machine learning approaches could significantly accelerate the design of novel glasses with tailored properties.

AB Eu3+ doped transparent glass and glass-ceramic were prepared by melt quenching method of P2O5-CaF2-Eu2O3 composition. The glass-ceramic samples were obtained by heat treatment of initial glass at 640 degrees C for 4 h. The structure properties of samples were characterized by XRD, DTA, SEM and EDS and their optical and spectroscopic studies were done using optical absorption, reflectance, FTIR, and emission spectra. X-ray diffraction patterns evidenced the formation of major phase of Ca(PO3)(2) nano crystals along with minor phases of Al-2(SiF6)(3), Eu and Eu-5(PO4)(3)F. The Tauc plots shows that the heat treatment increases allowed direct band gap and Urbach energy. Up frequency conversion properties of glassy and glass-ceramic samples have been investigated. Upconversion phenomena were observed in Eu3+ doped glass-ceramics samples.

AB To design new radiation shielding materials instead of conventional materials such as concrete with improved performance in gamma-ray shielding in nuclear reactors, defense applications, and medical sciences, very recently, there exists an increasing interest among researchers. For this purpose, heavy metal oxides based optical glasses attracted much attention, nowadays. In this work, five glass samples with nominal composition of (70-x) B2O3-5SiO(2)-5TeO(2)-10ZnO-10Li(2)O-xBaO (where x = 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 mol%) were fabricated by melt quenching technique. The structural and thermal studies were carried out using XRD, SEM/EDAX, FTIR , Raman, and TGA/DSC measurements. Different shielding parameters such as mass attenuation coefficients, effective atomic number, mean free path and exposure buildup factor have been calculated in order to investigate the effectiveness of using the prepared glasses as radiation shielding materials. The half-value layer of the prepared glasses has been compared to different types of concretes. The results of shielding properties indicate that addition of BaO significantly enhances shielding capability of the prepared glasses against gamma radiation.

Absorption (300 K), excitation (300 K) and fluorescence spectra (at 77 and 300 K) as well as fluorescence decay curves of the Pr3+-doped title glasses are presented and discussed. Basing on the Judd-Ofelt analysis, the phenomenological Judd-Ofelt parameters (Omega(2) = 2.13, Omega(4) = 16.8 and Omega(6) = 3.50 x 10(-20) cm(-2)), radiative transition probabilities (A(T)), branching ratios (beta), radiative lifetimes (tau(R)) and emission cross-sections (sigma(em)) were calculated for the luminescence from P-3(1), P-3(0), D-1(2) and (1)G(4) levels of the Pr3+ ion. The fluorescence from the (1)G(4) level of the Pr3+ ion has been observed after excitation at 445 nm in the P-3(2) state. The experimental lifetimes of the emission levels indicate strong concentration quenching. An analysis of non-radiative decay of the D-1(2) level indicate that energy migration via a diffusion limited relaxation and cross-relaxation processes are involved in the depopulation of this level. The spectroscopic results show that the investigated glasses are potentially candidates as at 1.3 mu m and 1.45 mu m laser host as well as reddish-orange to yellow tunable phosphor. Furthermore, a near-infrared downconversion process gives possibility of using of these materials as luminescent solar concentrators and near infrared lasers.

AB We study preconditioned iterative methods for the linear system arising in the numerical discretization of a two-dimensional space-fractional diffusion equation. Our approach is based on a formulation of the discrete problem that is shown to be the sum of two Kronecker products. By making use of an alternating Kronecker product splitting iteration technique we establish a class of fixed-point iteration methods. Theoretical analysis shows that the new method converges to the unique solution of the linear system. Moreover, the optimal choice of the involved iteration parameters and the corresponding asymptotic convergence rate are computed exactly when the eigenvalues of the system matrix are all real. The basic iteration is accelerated by a Krylov subspace method like GMRES. The corresponding preconditioner is in a form of a Kronecker product structure and requires at each iteration the solution of a set of discrete one-dimensional fractional diffusion equations. We use structure preserving approximations to the discrete one-dimensional fractional diffusion operators in the action of the preconditioning matrix. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of this approach. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We describe a method for the numerical evaluation of normalized versions of the associated Legendre functions P-v(-mu) and Q(v)(-mu) of degrees 0 <= v <= 1,000,000 and orders -v <= mu <= v for arguments in the interval (-1, 1). Our algorithm, which runs in time independent of v and mu, is based on the fact that while the associated Legendre functions themselves are extremely expensive to represent via polynomial expansions, the logarithms of certain solutions of the differential equation defining them are not. We exploit this by numerically precomputing the logarithms of carefully chosen solutions of the associated Legendre differential equation and representing them via piecewise trivariate Chebyshev expansions. These precomputed expansions, which allow for the rapid evaluation of the associated Legendre functions over a large swath of parameter domain mentioned above, are supplemented with asymptotic and series expansions in order to cover it entirely. The results of numerical experiments demonstrating the efficacy of our approach are presented, and our code for evaluating the associated Legendre functions is publicly available.

AB This paper develops a recently proposed GPU based two-dimensional explicit meshless method (Ma et al., 2014) by devising and implementing an efficient parallel LU-SGS implicit algorithm to further improve the computational efficiency. The capability of the original 2D meshless code is extended to deal with 3D complex compressible flow problems. To resolve the inherent data dependency of the standard LU-SGS method, which causes thread-racing conditions destabilizing numerical computation, a generic rainbow coloring method is presented and applied to organize the computational points into different groups by painting neighboring points with different colors. The original LU-SGS method is modified and parallelized accordingly to perform calculations in a color-by-color manner. The CUDA Fortran programming model is employed to develop the key kernel functions to apply boundary conditions, calculate time steps, evaluate residuals as well as advance and update the solution in the temporal space. Aseries of two- and three-dimensional test cases including compressible flows over single-and multi-element airfoils and a M6 wing are carried out to verify the developed code. The obtained solutions agree well with experimental data and other computational results reported in the literature. Detailed analysis on the performance of the developed code reveals that the developed CPU based implicit meshless method is at least four to eight times faster than its explicit counterpart. The computational efficiency of the implicit method could be further improved by ten to fifteen times on the GPU. (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper describes a new code for simulating astrophysical plasmas that solves a hybrid model composed of gyrokinetic ions (GKI) and an isothermal electron fluid (ITEF) Schekochihin et al. (2009) [9]. This model captures ion kinetic effects that are important near the ion gyro-radius scale while electron kinetic effects are ordered out by an electron-ion mass ratio expansion. The code is developed by incorporating the ITEF approximation into AstroGK, an Eulerian delta f gyrokinetics code specialized to a slab geometry Numata et al. (2010) [41]. The new code treats the linear terms in the ITEF equations implicitly while the nonlinear terms are treated explicitly. We show linear and nonlinear benchmark tests to prove the validity and applicability of the simulation code. Since the fast electron timescale is eliminated by the mass ratio expansion, the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition is much less restrictive than in full gyrokinetic codes; the present hybrid code runs similar to 2 root m(i)/m(e) similar to 100 times faster than AstroGK with a single ion species and kinetic electrons where m(i)/m(e) is the ion-electron mass ratio. The improvement of the computational time makes it feasible to execute ion scale gyrokinetic simulations with a high velocity space resolution and to run multiple simulations to determine the dependence of turbulent dynamics on parameters such as electron-ion temperature ratio and plasma beta.

AB This article deals with an efficient strategy for numerically simulating radiative transfer phenomena using distributed computing. The finite element method alongside the discrete ordinate method is used for spatio-angular discretization of the monochromatic steady-state radiative transfer equation in an anisotropically scattering media. Two very different methods of parallelization, angular and spatial decomposition methods, are presented. To do so, the finite element method is used in a vectorial way. A detailed comparison of scalability, performance, and efficiency on thousands of processors is established for two- and three-dimensional heterogeneous test cases. Timings show that both algorithms scale well when using proper preconditioners. It is also observed that our angular decomposition scheme outperforms our domain decomposition method. Overall, we perform numerical simulations at scales that were previously unattainable by standard radiative transfer equation solvers. (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Accurate and efficient wave equation modeling is vital for many applications in such as acoustics, electromagnetics, and seismology. However, solving the wave equation in large-scale and highly heterogeneous models is usually computationally expensive because the computational cost is directly proportional to the number of grids in the model. We develop a novel high-order multiscale finite-element method to reduce the computational cost of time-domain acoustic-wave equation numerical modeling by solving the wave equation on a coarse mesh based on the multiscale finite-element theory. In contrast to existing multiscale finite-element methods that use only first-order multiscale basis functions, our new method constructs high-order multiscale basis functions from local elliptic problems which are closely related to the Gauss-Lobatto-Legendre quadrature points in a coarse element. Essentially, these basis functions are not only determined by the order of Legendre polynomials, but also by local medium properties, and therefore can effectively convey the fine-scale information to the coarse-scale solution with high-order accuracy. Numerical tests show that our method can significantly reduce the computation time while maintain high accuracy for wave equation modeling in highly heterogeneous media by solving the corresponding discrete system only on the coarse mesh with the new high-order multiscale basis functions.

AB We present a positivity preserving variational scheme for the phase-field modeling of incompressible two-phase flows with high density ratio. The variational finite element technique relies on the Allen-Cahn phase-field equation for capturing the phase interface on a fixed Eulerian mesh with mass conservative and energy-stable discretization. The mass conservation is achieved by enforcing a Lagrange multiplier which has both temporal and spatial dependence on the underlying solution of the phase-field equation. To make the scheme energy-stable in a variational sense, we discretize the spatial part of the Lagrange multiplier in the phase-field equation by the mid-point approximation. The proposed variational technique is designed to reduce the spurious and unphysical oscillations in the solution while maintaining the second-order accuracy of both spatial and temporal discretizations. We integrate the Allen-Cahn phase-field equation with the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations for modeling a broad range of two-phase flow and fluid-fluid interface problems. The coupling of the implicit discretizations corresponding to the phase-field and the incompressible flow equations is achieved via nonlinear partitioned iterative procedure. Comparison of results between the standard linear stabilized finite element method and the present variational formulation shows a remarkable reduction of oscillations in the solution while retaining the boundedness of the phase-indicator field. We perform a standalone test to verify the accuracy and stability of the Allen-Cahn two-phase solver. We examine the convergence and accuracy properties of the coupled phase-field solver through the standard benchmarks of the Laplace-Young law and a sloshing tank problem. Two-and three-dimensional dam break problems are simulated to assess the capability of the phase-field solver for complex air-water interfaces involving topological changes on unstructured meshes. Finally, we demonstrate the phase-field solver for a practical offshore engineering application of wave-structure interaction. (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

   ORIENTATION
AB The presence of surfactants alters the dynamics of viscous drops immersed in an ambient viscous fluid. This is specifically true at small scales, such as in applications of droplet based microfluidics, where the interface dynamics become of increased importance. At such small scales, viscous forces dominate and inertial effects are often negligible. Considering Stokes flow, a numerical method based on a boundary integral formulation is presented for simulating 3D drops covered by an insoluble surfactant. The method is able to simulate drops with different viscosities and close interactions, automatically controlling the time step size and maintaining high accuracy also when substantial drop deformation appears. To achieve this, the drop surfaces as well as the surfactant concentration on each surface are represented by spherical harmonics expansions. A novel reparameterization method is introduced to ensure a high-quality representation of the drops also under deformation, specialized quadrature methods for singular and nearly singular integrals that appear in the formulation are evoked and the adaptive time stepping scheme for the coupled drop and surfactant evolution is designed with a preconditioned implicit treatment of the surfactant diffusion.

AB We propose two closely-related Lagrangian numerical methods for the simulation of physical processes involving advection, reaction and diffusion. The methods are intended to be used in settings where the flow is nearly incompressible and the Peclet numbers are so high that resolving all the scales of motion is unfeasible. This is commonplace in ocean flows. Our methods consist in augmenting the method of characteristics, which is suitable for advection-reaction problems, with couplings among nearby particles, producing fluxes that mimic diffusion, or unresolved small-scale transport. The methods conserve mass, obey the maximum principle, and allow to tune the strength of the diffusive terms down to zero, while avoiding unwanted numerical dissipation effects.

AB Endospore formation in the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis initiates in response to nutrient depletion and involves a series of morphological changes that result in the creation of a dormant spore. Early in this developmental process, the cell undergoes an asymmetric cell division that produces the larger mother cell and smaller forespore, the latter destined to become the mature spore. The mother cell septal membrane then engulfs the forespore, at which time an essential channel, the so-called feeding-tube apparatus, is thought to cross both membranes to create a direct conduit between the cells. At least nine proteins are required to form this channel including SpoIIQ under forespore control and SpoIIIAA-AH under the mother cell control. Several of these proteins share similarity to components of Type-II, -III and -IV secretion systems as well as the flagellum from Gram-negative bacteria. Here we report the X-ray crystallographic structure of the cytosolic domain of SpoIIIAB to 2.3 angstrom resolution. This domain adopts a conserved, secretion-system related fold of a six membered antiparallel helical bundle with a positively charged membrane-interaction face at one end and a small groove at the other end that may serve as a binding site for partner proteins in the assembled apparatus. We analyzed and identified potential interaction interfaces by structure-guided mutagenesis in vivo. Furthermore, we were able to identify a remarkable structural homology to the C-subunit of a bacterial V-ATPase. Collectively, our data provides new insight into the possible roles of SpoIIIAB protein within the secretion-like apparatus essential to bacterial sporulation.

AB Clostridium botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) cause the life-threatening condition, botulism. However, while they have the potential to cause serious harm, they are increasingly being utilised for therapeutic applications. BoNTs comprise of seven distinct serotypes termed BoNT/A through BoNT/G, with the most widely characterised being sub-serotype BoNT/A1. Each BoNT consists of three structurally distinct domains, a binding domain (H-C), a translocation domain (H-N), and a proteolytic domain (LC). The H-C domain is responsible for the highly specific targeting of the neurotoxin to neuronal cell membranes. Here, we present two high-resolution structures of the binding domain of subtype BoNT/A3 (H-C/A3) and BoNT/A4 (H-C/A4) at 1.6 angstrom and 1.34 angstrom resolution, respectively. The structures of both proteins share a high degree of similarity to other known BoNT H-C domains whilst containing some subtle differences, and are of benefit to research into therapeutic neurotoxins with novel characteristics.

   MECHANISM
AB Cellular metabolism of amino acids is controlled by a large number of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) dependent enzymes. Diaminopropionate ammonia lyase (DAPAL), a fold type II PLP-dependent enzyme, degrades both the D and L forms of diaminopropionic acid (DAP) to pyruvate and ammonia. Earlier studies on the Escherichia coli DAPAL (EcDAPAL) had suggested that a disulfide bond located close to the active site may be crucial for maintaining the geometry of the substrate entry channel and the active site. In order to obtain further insights into the catalytic properties of DAPAL, structural and functional studies on Salmonella typhimurium DAPAL (StDAPAL) were initiated. The three-dimensional X-ray crystal structure of StDAPAL was determined at 2.5 A resolution. As expected, the polypeptide fold and dimeric organization of StDAPAL is similar to those of EcDAPAL. A phosphate group was located in the active site of StDAPAL and expulsion of this phosphate is probably essential to bring Asp125 to a conformation suitable for proton abstraction from the substrate (D-DAP). The unique disulfide bond of EcDAPAL was absent in StDAPAL, although the enzyme displayed comparable catalytic activity. Site directed mutagenesis of the cysteine residues involved in disulfide bond formation in EcDAPAL followed by functional and biophysical studies further confirmed that the disulfide bond is not necessary either for substrate binding or for catalysis. The activity of StDAPAL but not EcDAPAL was enhanced by monovalent cations suggesting subtle differences in the active site geometries of these two closely related enzymes.

AB The information content of cryo EM data sets exceeds that of the electron scattering potential (cryo EM) density initially derived for structure determination. Previously we demonstrated the power of data variance analysis for characterizing regions of cryo EM density that displayed functionally important variance anomalies associated with maturation cleavage events in Nudaurelia Omega Capensis Virus and the presence or absence of a maturation pro PaCP in bacteriophage HK97 procapsids. Here we extend the analysis in two ways. First, instead of imposing icosahedral symmetry on every particle in the data set during the variance analysis, we only assume that the data set as a whole has icosahedral symmetry. This change removes artifacts of high variance along icosahedral symmetry axes, but retains all of the features previously reported in the HK97 data set. Second we present a covariance analysis that reveals correlations in structural dynamics (variance) between the interior of the HK97 procapsid with the protease and regions of the exterior (not seen in the absence of the protease). The latter analysis corresponds well with hydrogen deuterium exchange studies previously published that reveal the same correlation.

AB Cellular electron cryo-tomography enables the 3D visualization of cellular organization in the near-native state and at submolecular resolution. However, the contents of cellular tomograms are often complex, making it difficult to automatically isolate different in situ cellular components. In this paper, we propose a convolutional autoencoder-based unsupervised approach to provide a coarse grouping of 3D small subvolumes extracted from tomograms. We demonstrate that the autoencoder can be used for efficient and coarse characterization of features of macromolecular complexes and surfaces, such as membranes. In addition, the autoencoder can be used to detect non-cellular features related to sample preparation and data collection, such as carbon edges from the grid and tomogram boundaries. The autoencoder is also able to detect patterns that may indicate spatial interactions between cellular components. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our autoencoder can be used for weakly supervised semantic segmentation of cellular components, requiring a very small amount of manual annotation.

AB Many bacteria require L-rhamnose as a key cell wall component. This sugar is transferred to the cell wall using an activated donor dTDP-L-rhamnose, which is produced by the dTDP-L-rhamnose biosynthetic pathway. We determined the crystal structure of the second enzyme of this pathway dTDP-alpha-D-glucose 4,6-dehydratase (RfbB) from Bacillus anthracis. Interestingly, RfbB only crystallized in the presence of the third enzyme of the pathway RfbC; however, RfbC was not present in the crystal. Our work represents the first complete structural characterization of the four proteins of this pathway in a single Gram-positive bacterium.

AB The 2015 Mw 7.8 Gorkha earthquake has not only imposed effective constraints on the geometrical structures, friction behaviours and seismogenic patterns of the Nepal Himalaya thrust systems but has also provided valuable insights into the uplift mechanism and lithosphere rheology of the Tibetan Plateau. Here, similar to 1.6-year GPS observations are used to reveal the postseismic deformation characteristics following the Gorkha earthquake, investigate the ongoing aseismic afterslip on the Main Himalayan Thrust (MHT) fault and constrain the crustal rheology of the Southern Tibetan Plateau. First, afterslip is considered to be solely responsible for the postseismic deformation (afterslip-only model). The results show that afterslip is anticorrelated with peak coseismic slip areas. One high-afterslip-concentration area, with a peak of similar to 24 cm, is distributed downdip of the coseismic rupture, as well as in two other regions: one partially overlapping the mainshock rupture, and the other next to the Mw 7.3 aftershock area. Second, the GPS postseismic observations are inverted to jointly investigate afterslip and viscoelastic deformation (multiple-mechanism model). The afterslip inversion results of the above two models are highly consistent, indicating the dominant contribution of afterslip to surface deformation during the similar to 1.6-year postseismic period. Considering the interseismic fault coupling and historical seismicity, no appreciable fault slip associated with the Gorkha earthquake is found to occur both updip and west of the mainshock rupture areas. This reveals that the Gorkha earthquake only unzipped the lower edge of the locked portion of the MHT, leaving the shallow portion and western segment of the seismogenic zone still locked and the Nepal region under high seismic risk. The viscoelastic mechanism contributes minorly to surface deformation during the similar to 1.6-year postseismic period. The middle-lower crust is assumed to comprise Maxwell material beneath an elastic similar to 25-km-thick upper crust and the optimal viscosity is conservatively estimated to be 1.6 x 10(19) Pa s beneath the Southern Tibetan Plateau, which should be robustly constrained with more long-term observations, more effective spatial constraints, and more detailed crustal models.

TI A magmatic-hydrothermal lacustrine exhalite from the Permian Lucaogou

AB Shales in the middle Permian Lucaogou Formation in the intracontinental Santanghu rift basin have been considered as "typical" organic-rich profundal shales for decades. Our study of well cores using petrographic microscope and scanning electron microscopy suggests an otherwise complex hydrovolcanic and hydrothermal origin. This paper describes characteristics of a particular type of the shales, composed of fine-grained detrital minerals and lithic grains. Some of them are orthopyroxene, calcite, peralkaline feldspars, and analcime that are interpreted as derived from peralkaline-alkaline carbonatite, pyroxenite, analcime phonolite, and andesite, whereas others are quartz, dolomite, ankerite, serpentine, and calcite that were precipitated from syndepositional or penecontemporary hydrothermal fluids. Grain size ranges from 0.001 to 2 mm, mostly 0.01-0.1 mm. Well-developed laminae are mostly 0.5-3 mm thick and alternate with tuffaceous dolomicrite. The rocks are interpreted as sublacustrine hydrovolcanic deposits, which had been altered by syndepositional hydrothermal fluids. The interpretation is substantiated by abundant cone-shaped stratigraphic buildups on seismic sections in the basin. This study shows an ancient example of volcanic-hydrothermal deposits in a rift basin.

AB A detailed investigation of potential provenance is still lacking in the southwestern Tarim Basin, which restricts our complete understanding of Cenozoic source-to-sink relations between the basin interior and the Pamir salient - western Kunlun Mountain Range. Debate also exists concerning the potential sources of the Paleogene and Cretaceous igneous detritus present in the Cenozoic sedimentary sequences. Here, we present U-Pb (LA-ICP-MS) ages of detrital zircons from the continuous Eocene-Pliocene sediment series in the well-exposed Aertashi section to investigate changes in sediment provenance through time. The U-Pb detrital zircon ages range widely from 45 to 3204 Ma and can be divided into seven main groups: 45-65 Ma (sub-peak at 49 Ma), 67-103 Ma (sub-peak at 95 Ma), 196-251 Ma (sub-peak at 208 Ma), 252-416 Ma (sub-peak at 296 Ma), 417-540 Ma (sub-peak at 446 Ma), 550-1429 Ma (sub-peaks at 614 Ma, 828 Ma and 942 Ma) and 1345-3204 Ma (sub-peaks at 1773 Ma and 2480 Ma). These zircons were mainly derived from the western Kunlun Mountain Range and northern Pamir salient to the west and south. The evolution of the provenance and source-to-sink relationship patterns in the southwestern Tarim Basin can be divided into three stages: (1) The Middle Eocene to Lower Oligocene sediments display a wide variety of detrital zircon ages, suggesting that the source area was extensive. (2) A major change in provenance occurred during the Late Oligocene to Early Miocene and was characterized by an abrupt increase in the proportion of Triassic and Lower Paleozoic igneous components, implying a significant adjustment in topography induced by the initial uplift and exhumation of the western Kunlun Mountain Range and northern Pamir salient. (3) In the Late Miocene, the source-to-sink system transformed again, and contributions of Triassic to Lower Paleozoic material weakened substantially due to the sufficient indentation of the Pamir salient. Our integrated analyses of zircon geochronology indicate that the main source terranes of the Paleogene and Cretaceous igneous detritus are the central and southern Pamir salient, respectively, which are speculated to have been continuously connected to the study area during Eocene-Pliocene times, although such detritus is scarce in certain formations and has not yet been detected.

AB SEDEX sulfide deposits hosted in black shale and carbonate are common in the South China Block. The Dajiangping pyrite deposit is the largest of these deposits and is made up of stratiform orebodies hosted in black shales. Sandstone interlayered with stratiform orebodies contains detrital zircon grains with the youngest ages of 429 Ma. Pyrite from the orebodies has a Re-Os isochron age of 389 +/- 62 Ma, indicative of formation of the hosting strata and syngenetic pyrite ores in the mid-late Devonian. The hosting strata is a transgression sequence in a passive margin and composed of carbonaceous limestone in the lower part and black shales in the upper part. The ore-hosting black shales have high TOC (total organic carbon), Mo, As, Pb, Zn and Cd, indicating an anoxic-euxinic deep basin origin. The high redox proxies, V/(V + Ni) > 0.6 and V/Cr > 1, and the positive correlations of TOC with Mo and V in black shales are also consistent with an anoxic depositional environment. The Dajiangping deposit is located close to the NE-trending Wuchuan-Sihui fault, which was active during the Devonian. The mid-late Devonian mineralization age and the anoxic-euxinic deep basinal condition of this deposit thus imply that the formation of this deposit was causally linked to hydrothermal fluid exhalation in an anoxic fault-bounded basin that developed in a carbonate platform of the South China Block. The regional distribution of many Devonian, stratiform, carbonaceous sediment-hosted sulfide deposits along the NE-trending fault-bounded basins in South China, similar to the Dajiangping deposit, indicates that these deposits formed at a basin developed in the passive margin setting of the South China Block during the Devonian. This environment was caused by the break-up and northward migration of the South China Block from Gandwana.

AB The early Paleozoic Wuyi-Yunkai orogen was associated with extensive felsic magmatic activities and the orogenic core was mainly distributed in the Yunkai and Wugong domains located in the western Cathaysia block and in the Wuyi domain located in the central part of the Cathaysia block. In order to investigate the evolution of the Wuyi-Yunkai orogen, elemental and Sr-Nd isotopic analyses were performed for granites from the Baoxu pluton in the Yunkai domain and from the Enping pluton in the central part of the Cathaysia block. The Baoxu pluton consists of biotite granite with abundant xenoliths of gneissic granite, granodiorite and diorite, and the Enping pluton is mainly composed of massive granodiorite. Biotite granites (441 +/- 5 Ma) and gneissic granite xenolith (443 +/- 4 Ma) of the Baoxu pluton are all weakly peraluminous (A/CNK = 1.05-1.10). They show high Sr/Y and La/Yb ratios and have negative bulk-rock e(Nd)(t) values (-7.0 to -4.4), which are similar to coeval gneissic S-type granites in the Yunkai domain and were probably derived from dehydration melting of a sedimentary source with garnet residue in the source. Granodiorites (429 +/- 3 Ma) from Enping and granodiorite xenolith (442 +/- 4 Ma) from Baoxu are metaluminous and have REE patterns with enriched light REE and flat middle to heavy REE, possibly generated by the dehydration melting of an igneous basement at middle to lower crustal level. Diorite xenolith from Baoxu is ultrapotassic (K2O = 4.9 wt%), has high contents of MgO (7.0 wt%), Cr (379 ppm) and Ni (171 ppm) and shows pronounced negative Nb, Ta and Ti anomalies. This xenolith also has negative eNd(t) value (-3.6) and low Rb/Ba and high Ba/Sr ratios, and is thus interpreted to be derived from an enriched lithospheric mantle with the breakdown of phlogopite. Early Paleozoic I- and S-type granites in the Wuyi-Yunkai orogen mostly have negative e(Nd)(t) values and do not have juvenile components, consistent with genesis by an intracontinental orogenic event. These early Paleozoic granites occur near the ancient suture zone between the Yangtze and Cathaysia blocks and have high La/Yb and Sr/Y ratios, likely due to the existence of residual garnet in the source, suggesting the thickened crust at ca. 440 Ma. The 450-440 Ma gneissic S-type granites near the suture zone are earlier than those in the central part of the Cathaysia block (similar to 430 Ma). The crustal thickening along the ancient suture zone at 440 Ma propagated into the central part of the Cathaysia block as evidenced by the 430 Ma granites. Early Paleozoic I-type granites near the suture zone clearly show involvement of significant mantle-derived materials, in contrast to granites in the central part of the Cathaysia block. The ancient suture zone may have acted as channels for the emplacement of mafic magmas during the collapse of an intracontinental orogen.

AB Natural gases in the Carboniferous Donghe Sandstone reservoir within the Block HD4 of the Hadexun Oilfield, Tarim Basin are characterized by abnormally low total hydrocarbon gas contents (< 65%), low methane contents (< 10%) and low dryness coefficients (< 0.5), and a reversal of the normal trend of carbon isotope ratios, showing delta C-13 methane (C-1) > delta C-13 ethane (C-2) < delta C-13 propane (C-3) < delta C-13 butane (C-4). Specifically, methane is enriched in C-13 with the variations in delta C-13(1) values between gases from Block HD4 and gases from its neighboring blocks reaching 10 parts per thousand. This type of abnormal gas has never been reported previously in the Tarim Basin and such large variations in delta C-13 have rarely been observed in other basins globally. Based on a comprehensive analysis of gas geochemical data and the geological setting of the Carboniferous reservoirs in the Hadexun Oilfield, we reveal that the anomalies of the gas compositions and carbon isotope ratios in the Donghe Sandstone reservoir are caused by gas diffusion through the poorly-sealed caprock rather than by pathways such as gas mixing, microorganism degradation, different kerogen types or thermal maturity degrees of source rocks. The documentation of an in-reservoir gas diffusion during the post entrapment process as a major cause for gas geochemical anomalies may offer important insight into exploring natural gas resources in deeply buried sedimentary basins.

AB Climatic changes in the Asian southwest monsoon (ASWM) during the Holocene have become a topic of recent studies. It is important to understand the patterns and causes of Holocene climatic changes and their relationship with global changes. Based on the climate proxies and wavelet analysis of Lugu Lake in the ASWM region, the climatic fluctuations and periodic changes in the ASWM region during the Holocene have been reconstructed with a high-precision chronology. The results indicate the intensification of ASWM began to increase with Northern Hemisphere low-latitude solar insolation (LSI) and solar activity during the early Holocene, and gradually decreased during the late Holocene, exhibiting an apparent synchrony with numerous records of ASWM region. Meanwhile, an apparent 1000-a quasi-periodic signal is present in the environment proxies, and it demonstrates that the environmental change in the ASWM region has been driven mainly by LSI and solar activity.

AB Palaeoflood slackwater deposits (SWDs) along the river banks have important implications for the reconstruction of the past hydro-climatic events. Two palaeoflood SWD beds were identified in the Holocene loess-soil sequences on the cliff river banks along the Gold Gorge of the upper Hanjiang River by field investigation and laboratory analysis. They have recorded two palaeoflood events which were dated by optically stimulated luminescence to 3.2-2.8 ka and 2.1-1.8 ka, respectively. The reliability of the ages obtained for the two events are further confirmed by the presence of archaeological remains and good regional pedostratigraphic correlation. The peak discharges of two palaeoflood events at the studied sites were estimated to be 16,560-17,930 m(3)/s. A correlation with the palaeoflood events identified in the other reaches shows that great floods occurred frequently during the episodes of 3200-2800 and 2000-1700 a BP along the upper Hanjiang River valley during the last 4000 years. These phases of palaeoflood events in central China are well correlated with the climatic variability identified by 8180 record in the stalagmites from the middle Yangtze River Basin and show apparent global linkages. Palaeoflood studies in a watershed scale also imply that strengthened human activities during the Shang dynasty (BCE 1600-1100) and Han dynasty (BCE206-CE265) may have caused accelerated soil erosion along the upper Hanjiang River valley.

AB The ocean floor in the Bay of Bengal has evolved after the breakup of India from Antarctica since the Early Cretaceous. Recent geophysical investigations including updated satellite derived gravity map postulated two phases for the tectonic evolution of the Bay of Bengal, the first phase of spreading occurred in the NW-SE direction forming its Western Basin, while the second phase occurred in the N-S direction resulting in its Eastern Basin.
   Lack of magnetic data along the spreading direction in the Western Basin prompted us to acquire new magnetic data along four tracks (totaling similar to 3000 km) to validate the previously identified magnetic anomaly picks. Comparison of the synthetic seafloor spreading model with the observed magnetic anomalies confirmed the presence of Mesozoic anomalies M12n to MO in the Western Basin. Further, the model suggests that this spreading between India and Antarctica took place with half-spreading rates of 2.7-4.5 cm/yr.
   The trend of the fracture zones in the Western Basin with respect to that of the Southeastern Continental Margin of India (SCMI) suggests that SCMI is an oblique transform margin with 37 degrees obliquity. Further, the SCMI consists of two oblique transform segments separated by a small rift segment. The strike-slip motion along the SCMI is bounded by the rift segments of the Northeastern Continental Margin of India and the southern margin of Sri Lanka.
   The margin configuration and fracture zones inferred in its conjugate Western Enderby Basin, East Antarctica helped in inferring three spreading corridors off the SCMI in the Western Basin of the Bay of Bengal. Detailed grid reconstruction models traced the oblique strike-slip motion off the SCMI since M12n time. The strike-slip motion along the short northern transform segment ended by M11n time. The longer transform segment, found east of Sri Lanka lost its obliquity and became a pure oceanic transform fault by MO time. The eastward propagation of the Africa-Antarctica spreading center initiated the anticlockwise separation of Sri Lanka from India by M12n time. Seafloor spreading south of Sri Lanka due to the India-Antarctica spreading episode and the simultaneously occurring strike-slip motion east of Sri Lanka restricted this separation resulting in a failed rift. Thus Sri Lanka with strike-slip motion to its east, failed rift towards west, continental extension to its north and rifting to its south behaved as a short lived microplate during the Early Cretaceous period and remained attached to India thereafter.

AB The Maoniushan Formation in the northern part of the North Qaidam Orogen (NQO), NW China, contains key information on a Paleozoic change in tectonic setting of the NQO from compression to extension. Here, new zircon U-Pb, petrological, and sedimentological data for the lower molasse sequence of the Maoniushan Formation are used to constrain the timing of this tectonic transition. Detrital zircons yield U-Pb ages of 3.3-0.4 Ga with major populations at 0.53-0.4, 1.0-0.56, 2.5-1.0, and 3.3-2.5 Ga. The maximum depositional age of the Maoniushan Formation is well constrained by a youngest detrital zircon age of similar to 409 Ma. Comparing these dates with geochronological data for the region indicates that Proterozoic-Paleozoic zircons were derived mainly from the NQO as well as the Oulongbuluk and Qaidam blocks, whereas Archean zircons were probably derived from the Oulongbuluk Block and the Tarim Craton. The similar to 924, similar to 463, and similar to 439 Ma tectonothermal events recorded in this region indicate that the NQO was involved in the early Neoproterozoic assembly of Rodinia and early Paleozoic microcontinental convergence. A regional angular unconformity between Devonian and pre-Devonian strata within the NQO suggests a period of strong mountain building between the Oulongbuluk and Qaidam blocks during the Silurian, whereas an Early Devonian post-orogenic molasse, evidence of extensional collapse, and Middle to Late Devonian bimodal volcanic rocks and Carboniferous marine carbonate rocks clearly reflect long-lived tectonic extension. Based on these results and the regional geology, we suggest that the Devonian volcano-sedimentary rocks within the NQO were formed in a post-orogenic extensional setting similar to that of the East Kunlun Orogen, indicating that a major tectonic transition from compression to extension in these two orogens probably commenced in the Early Devonian.

AB By presenting benthic foraminifera isotope profiles and bulk geochemical composition of core sediments, we offer a mutiproxy reconstruction of the central Okhotsk Sea oceanography between similar to 130 to and similar to 115 kyr, related to the marine isotopic stage Se (MIS Se). Sediments from the site MR0604-PC7A have been compared with paleo- sea surface temperatures and other records. This multiparameter approach allowed to recognize three periods for MIS 5e evolution, characterized by variations in marine productivity and bottom oxygenation. These variations have been ultimately associated with the production of Okhotsk Sea Intermediate Water and the presence or absence of nutrient contribution from the Pacific Deep Water into central Okhotsk Sea. Aeolian input reconstructed by Th/Sc ratio indicates higher values during the MIS 6 and MIS 5d compared with the MIS 5e. Eu* values indicate an input of detrital material from Kurile Islands and East-Kamchatka during the late MIS Se, absent during the early MIS 5e and glacial periods.

AB Significant discrepancies have existed regarding rate and timing of the uplift of Lutao (Green Island), located at the border of the ongoing collision between the Eurasia continental plate and the Philippine Sea Plate. To document its neotectonic history, two cores were drilled into Holocene coral reefs exposed at the southeastern coast of Lutao. Twelve pristine fossil corals, nine taken from cores and three on the surface, were Th-230 dated. The results show that the coral reefs started to develop at 8,736 +/- 56 yr BP (before 1950 CE) with uplift rate varying from 3.6 mm/yr during 8.7-6.0 kyr BP to 1.2 mm/yr in the past six thousand years. Our study strongly suggests that the uplift rate can vary significantly on millennial time scale. Caution should be used when extrapolating uplift rate estimates based on Mid-late Holocene corals to early times for tectonic active locations, such as Lutao.

AB Cenozoic right -lateral shear between the eastern Indian margin and Eurasia is expressed by numerous N-S trending fault systems inboard of the Sunda trench, including the Sagaing Fault. The most easterly of these fault systems is the prominent similar to 500 km long Kyaukkyan Fault, on the Shan Plateau. Myanmar's largest recorded earthquake, M-w 7.7 on 23rd May 1912, focused near Maymyo, has been attributed to the Kyaukkyan Fault, but the area has experienced little significant seismicity since then. Despite its demonstrated seismic potential and remarkable topographic expression, questions remain about the Kyaukkyan Fault's neotectonic history.
   In this study we document robust geologic evidence of fault activity along the Kyaukkyan Fault. Field investigation and interpretation of satellite imagery reveal deformation features developed along a fault system mostly indicative of Quaternary dextral strike-slip faulting. Clearly defined tectonic geomorphology, including fault scarps and linear valleys, are used to trace the northernmost and southernmost part of the fault. The fault's central section is characterised by a complex pull-apart system, whose normal border faults show signals of relatively slow recent activity.
   Dextral transtensional activity along the Kyaukkyan Fault is recorded by geomorphic features such as sag ponds, shutter ridges, offset and beheaded streams, triangular facets and low-sinuosity mountain fronts. The Quaternary age of activity is demonstrated by short-lived geomorphic features such as wind-gaps, offset and deformed alluvial fans, and even offset of man-made structures. In the Inle basin, alluvial fan successions along the easternmost mountain front reveal a vertical transition from faulted and folded alluvial fan sequences adjacent to pre-Cenozoic flanking ranges, to overlying gravels that appear less deformed. Conversely, a locally buried cross-basin fault system has fresh geomorphic expression even within the uppermost parts of the lacustrine/fluvial basin fill. This may indicate Quaternary migration of dominant fault deformation from sidewall faults to a cross-basin fault system, which is indicative of a mature strike-slip fault system and has been observed in other active strike-slip faults around the world and in analogue models.

AB The southern front of the Greater Caucasus is quite rectilinear in plan view, with the exception of part of the Rioni Basin, where marine and continental deposits of Cretaceous-Neogene age were locally folded and uplifted; this resulted in the formation of an arcuate fold-and-thrust system that extends 45 km into the foreland. Although previous studies suggested that this system has developed only since Miocene times, our new detailed and systematic field measurements of brittle and ductile structures show a very complex history, consisting in four main phases of brittle deformation and folding, dated from Eocene to Quaternary times. We collected microtectonic data at 248 faults, and calculated the related paleostress tensors. The first two phases which we document here, predated folding and were characterised by dominant transcurrent faulting and subordinate reverse motions; the greatest principal stress sigma(1) was perpendicular and later parallel to the mountain belt. Afterwards, NW-SE, E-W and NE-SW trending, south-vergent asymmetrical folds started to form. hi the western sector of the study area, folds are sinuous in plan view, whereas to the east they show a left-stepping, en-echelon geometry. Another two, brittle deformation phases took place after the folding, due to the activity of a set of right-lateral, strike-slip faults that strike NW-SE and NE-SW, respectively, as well as by left-lateral strike-slip faults, mostly striking NW-SE, NE-SW and NNE-SSW. These two additional phases were produced by a NE-SW to N-S trending sigma(1). The arcuate belt is marked by along-strike variations in the tectonic regime and deformation geometry, plus belt-parallel stretching. Based on our field data, integrated with published analogue models, we suggest a possible explanation for the Rioni structure, in terms of the oblique, asymmetric indentation of an upper crustal blocks moving to the SSW.

AB Constraints on the timing and style of the Tibetan Plateau growth help spur new understanding of the tectonic evolution of the northern Tibetan Plateau and its relation to the India-Asia continental collision. In this regard, records of tectonic deformation with accurate ages are urgently needed, especially in regions without relevant studies. The Kumkol basin, located between two major intermontane basins (the Hoh Xil and Qaidam basins), may hold clues to how these major basins evolve during the Cenozoic. However, little has been known about the exact ages of the strata and tectonic deformation of the basin. Herein, detailed paleomagnetic and structural studies are conducted on the southern Baiquanhe section in the central Kumkol basin, northern Tibetan Plateau. The magnetostratigraphic study indicates that the southern Baiquanhe section spans a time interval of 8.2-4.2 Ma. Well-preserved growth strata date to 7.5 Ma, providing evidence for a significant thrust fault-related folding. This thrust-related folding has also been identified in the Tian Shan foreland and in the northern Tibetan Plateau, most likely implying a pulsed basinward deformation during the late Miocene.

TI Greigite formed in early Pleistocene lacustrine sediments from the

AB The ferrimagnetic iron sulfide greigite (Fe3S4) occurs widely in sulfidic lacustrine and marine sedimentary environments. Knowledge of its formation and persistence is important for both magnetostratigraphic and paleoenvironmental studies. Although the formation mechanism of greigite has been widely demonstrated, the sedimentary environments associated with greigite formation in lakes, especially on relatively long timescales, are poorly understood. A long and continuous sequence of Pleistocene lacustrine sediments was recovered in the Heqing drill core from southwestern China, which provides an outstanding record of continental climate and environment. Integrated magnetic, geochemical, and paleoclimatic analysis of the lacustrine sequence provides an opportunity to improve our understanding of the environmental controls on greigite formation. Rock magnetic and scanning electron microscope analyses of selected samples from the core reveal that greigite is present in the lower part of the core (part 1, 665.8-372.5 m). Greigite occurs throughout this interval and is the dominant magnetic mineral, irrespective of the climatic state. The magnetic susceptibility (chi) record, which is mainly controlled by the concentration of greigite, matches well with variations in the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) index and total organic carbon (TOC) content, with no significant time lag. This indicates that the greigite formed during early diagenesis. In greigite-bearing intervals, with the chi increase, B-c value increase and tends to be stable at about 50 mT. Therefore, we suggest that chi values could estimate the variation of greigite concentration approximately in the Heqing core. Greigite favored more abundant in terrigenous-rich and organic poor layers associated with weak summer monsoon which are characterized by high chi values, high Fe content, high Rb/Sr ratio and low TOC content. Greigite enhancement can be explained by variations in terrigenous inputs. Our studies demonstrate that, not only the greigite formation, but also its concentration changes could be useful for studying climatic and environmental variability in sulfidic environments.

AB The island of New Guinea is the result of continent-arc collision that began building the island's Central Range during the late Miocene. Recent studies have shown that rapid subduction, uplift and exhumation events took place in response to rapid, oblique convergence between the Pacific and the Australian plates. The tectonic and sedimentary evolution of Cenderawasih Bay, in the northwestern part of the New Guinea Island is still poorly understood: this bay links a major structural block, the Kepala Burung block, to the island's Central Ranges. Previous studies have shown that Cenderawasih Bay contains a thick (> 8 km) sequence of undated sediments. One hypothesis claims that the embayment resulted from a 3 Ma opening created by anticlockwise rotation of the Kepala Burung block with respect to the northern rim of the Australian plate. Alternatively, the current configuration of Cenderawasih Bay could have resulted from the southwest drift of a slice of volcanics and oceanic crust between 8 and 6 Ma. We test these hypotheses using (i) a geomorphologic analysis of the drainage network dynamics, (ii) a reassessment of available thermochronological data, and (iii) seismic lines interpretation. We suggest that sediments started to accumulate in Cenderawasih Bay and onshore in the Waipoga Basin in the late Miocene since the inception of growth of the Central Range, beginning at 12 Ma, resulting in sediment accumulation of up to 12,200 m. This evidence is more consistent with the second hypothesis, and the volume of sediment accumulated means it is unlikely that the embayment was the result of recent (2-3 Ma) rotation of structural blocks. At first order, we predict that infilling is mainly composed of siliciclastics sourced in the graphite-bearing Ruffaer Metamorphic Belt and its equivalent in the Weyland Overthrust. Ophiolites, volcanic arc rocks and diorites contribute minor proportions. From the unroofing paths in the Central Range we deduce two rates of solid phase accumulation (SPAR) since 12 Ma, the first one at a mean SPAR ranging between 0.12 and 0.25 mm/a with a maximum SPAR of 0.23-0.58 mm/a, and the second during the last 3 Ma, at a mean SPAR ranging between 0.93 and 1.62 mm/a and with a maximum SPAR between 2.13 and 3.17 mm/a, i.e., 6700-10,000 m of Plio-Pleistocene sediment accumulation. Local transtensional tectonics may explain these unusually high rates of sedimentation in an overall sinistral oblique convergence setting.

AB Analysis of high resolution satellite derived free air gravity data has been undertaken in the Greater Maldive Ridge (GMR) (Maldive Ridge, Deep Sea Channel, northern limit of Chagos Bank) segment of the Chagos Laccadive Ridge and the adjoining Arabian and Central Indian Basins. A Complete Bouguer Anomaly (CBA) map was generated from the Indian Ocean Geoidal Low removed Free Air Gravity (hereinafter referred to as "FAG-IOGL") data by incorporating Bullard A, B and C corrections. Using the Parker method, Moho topography was initially computed by inverting the CBA data. From the CBA the Mantle Residual Gravity Anomalies (MRGA) were computed by incorporating gravity effects of sediments and lithospheric temperature and pressure induced anomalies. Further, the MRGA was inverted to get Moho undulations from which the crustal thickness was also estimated. It was found that incorporating the lithospheric thermal and pressure anomaly correction has provided substantial improvement in the computed Moho depths especially in the oceanic areas. But along the GMR, there was not much variation in the Moho thickness computed with and without the thermal and pressure gravity correction implying that the crustal thickness of the ridge does not depend on the oceanic isochrones used for the thermal corrections. The estimated Moho depths in the study area ranges from 7 km to 28 km and the crustal thickness from 2 km to 27 km. The Moho depths are shallower in regions closer to Central Indian Ridge in the Arabian Basin i.e., the region to the west of the GMR is thinner compared to the region in the east (Central Indian Basin). The thickest crust and the deepest Moho are found below the N-S trending GMR segment of the Chagos-Laccadive Ridge. Along the GMR the crustal thickness decreases from north to south with thickness of 27 km below the Maldives Ridge reducing to similar to 9 km at 3 degrees S and further increasing towards Chagos Bank. Even though there are similarities in crustal thickness between Maldive Ridge and other regions like Mascarene Plateau which was recently interpreted as underlain by continental crust, much more geoscientific work including drilling has to be undertaken to finally confirm the exact nature of the ridge.

In this work, we report a facile strategy to synthesize the nanocomposite of porous NaTi2(PO4)(3) nanoparticles coated with a thin carbon layer (NTP/C). The unique structural and component merits endow the NTP/C nanocomposite with excellent charge transfer kinetics and enhanced structural stability. Compared with the pristine NTP nanoparticles, the NTP/C nanocomposite exhibits significant enhanced rate capability (108.9 mA h g (1) at 0.2C and 55.0 mA h g (1) at 20C) and long-term cycling performance (capacity retention of 78.8% after 2000 cycles at 10C). The electrochemical results indicate the NTP/C nanocomposite could be a high-performance anode material for SIBs. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we firstly prepared V0.13Mo0.87O2.935/MoS2 nanocomposites via in-situ hydrothermal approach based on the NH4VO3 and MoS2 as precursors. The structures and morphologies of the obtained products indicated that the cluster composites have flower-like structure with an average particle size of about 2 mu m assembled by regular nanosheets and they were comprised of 2H-MoS2 phase and hexagonal V0.13Mo0.87O2.935 phase. Furthermore, the visible-driven photocatalytic experiment results showed that the V0.13Mo0.87O2.935/MoS2 composites display better degradation ability in contrast to pure MoS2 and the optimal V0.13Mo0.87O2.935 (10 wt%)/MoS2 sample with the largest K value of 0.04908 min (1) showed the most significant total removal rate of Rhodmine B (RhB) is up to 96.72%. Finally, the enhanced photocatalytic activities of the products could be attributed to the suppression of charge recombination by confined space effect. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Bi7O9I3 photocatalysts were successfully synthesized by a microwave irradiation method at different temperatures and times. The effects of synthesis conditions on the phase, optical property, surface morphology and elemental composition of as-synthesized catalysts were investigated. Results revealed the presence of Bi7O9I3 with band gap energy ranging from 2.20 eV to 2.24 eV. Moreover, photocatalytic activity of Bi7O9I3 was evaluated by the degradation efficiency of bisphenol A (BPA) under xenon lamp illumination. Among the samples, Bi7O9I3 synthesized at 160 degrees C for 30 min displayed the best photocatalytic performance. The removal efficiency of BPA was affected by pH value of BPA solutions and gradually enhanced with the increase of pH from 3 to 10. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are essential to metal-air batteries and fuel cells. Highly efficient and low-cost electrocatalysts for oxygen reactions are in urgent demand. Herein, we synthesized materials through Fe2O3 and NiO depositing on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) by hydrothermal method, which can perform as efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for the ORR and OER. These catalysts mainly contain macropores which can provide sufficient surface area for active sites. With metal oxides depositing on CNTs, it overcomes some drawbacks such as low conductivity and agglomeration of metal oxides. The catalysts show great electrocatalytic toward ORR and OER even comparing with commercial Pt-C/RuO2 catalysts. Through constructing an air battery and testing the performance of cycling, the stability of the catalyst can also be proved. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A novel strategy based on Metal-organic frameworks nanoparticles (MOFs NPs)-stabilized suspension polymerization has been achieved for the preparation of multifunctional MOFs/polymers composites. By using this technique, functional nanoparticles can be immobilized on the surface of polymer to significantly modify their properties. In this paper, ZIF-8 nanoparticles (NPs) are used as stabilizer for the suspension polymerization of hexadecyl acrylate (AA16) in water and ZIF-8/PAA16 composites are successfully synthesized. The thermodynamics characterizations of ZIF-8/PAA16 were systematically investigated by combining differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), suggesting good phase change behavior and excellent thermal stability of the products. Thanks to the adsorption property of MOFs nanoparticles, the products behave the performance of removing Rhodamine B (RhB) from water. This method using functional MOF NPs as stabilizer will open up a new route to the preparation of a wide range of multifunction polymers. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) is a promising solution to relieve global energy crisis and environmental issues because of its superiority in low cost, easy fabrication procedures and relatively high efficiency. The decrease of fabrication cost without sacrifice of power conversion efficiency of the DSSCs can doubtlessly contribute to its commercial application. Here we report a new Pt-free RuCoSe ternary alloy counter electrode (CE) by electrodepositing. The DSSC device with RuCoSe ternary alloy CE achieves a power conversion efficiency of 9.07%, which is higher than 7.03% from Pt-only CE based DSSC. The easy preparation method and promising results provide a new method for decreasing cost but enhancing photovoltaic performance of DSSCs. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A facile, but effective, method has been developed for enhancing the upconversion (UC) luminescence efficiency of YF3: Yb3+, Er3+ microcrystals through doping of Cu2+ ion, accompanied by phase transformation from YF3 to alpha-NaYF4 to (alpha+beta)-NaYF4. The Cu2+ ion occupies the Y3+ ion crystal lattice site leading to positive vacancy and lower energy barrier in the reaction of forming alpha-NaYF4. In addition, we have also systematically investigated the phase transformation from YF3 to (alpha+beta)-NaYF4. With the extension of the reaction time, surface energy of the [1010] crystal plane decreases dramatically while that of the [0001] crystal plane increases accordingly, which may be the main reason for forming (alpha+beta b)-NaYF4. This synthesis strategy enables UC luminescence enhancement and simultaneous crystal phase transformation, which should inspire more even wider application of other UC host materials.

AB Bridgman method with stationary crucible was used to grow NiMnCuGa single crystal. Microstructure observations, as well as XRD pattern, revealed a presence of martensitic structure at room temperature. Crystal structure was determined as a non-modulated tetragonal martensite. The phase transition occurred at 296 K and 290 K on heating and cooling, respectively. Magnetic entropy change (DSM) reached a peak value of -9.86 J/kgK at the field of 1520 kA/m. Refrigerant capacity (RC), calculated at FWHM of the DSM peak, reached a value of 28.5 J/kg. Directly measured adiabatic temperature change (Delta T-ad) spread over 51 K range and its maximum value reached 0.23 K at 1520 kA/m field. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The surface oxide film has adverse effect on the brazing of aluminum alloy. In this work, the novel method of surface activation was proposed to remove the surface oxide film of aluminum alloy and promote the atomic diffusion, which improved the microstructure and mechanical properties of brazed joints. Through surface activation process, the surface oxide film was eliminated effectively. The content of grain boundary and the surface dislocation density of the aluminum alloy were increased. The atomic diffusion in brazed joints with surface activation was observed evidently and residual oxide film was removed. The microstructure and shear strength of brazed joint were improved by surface activation, which formed the sound brazed joints. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) from gaseous hydrocarbon sources has shown great promises for large-scale graphene growth, but the high growth temperature may destroy the metal skeleton. Here we demonstrate a facile CVD route to grow 3D network of graphene on Ni foam at a low temperature of 550 degrees C, adopting camphor as the feedstock. A freestanding graphene network with no binder and high conductivity can be obtained to act as efficient supercapacitor electrodes, exhibiting a high specific capacitance of 390 F/g without combining with any other electroactive materials. This research provides a feasible method for low-cost, high-performance and renewable materials in energy conversion and storage devices. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Novel MnFe2O4/g-C3N4 composites were successfully synthesized via a facile hydrothermal route in combination with ultrasonication and calcination techniques. XRD patterns of the as-synthesized composite furnished evidence for presence of both MnFe2O4 and g-C3N4 components. SEM and TEM micrographs also confirmed the successful formation of the MnFe2O4/g-C3N4 composite. The catalytic efficiency of the synthesized composite was investigated in crossed aldol condensation of acetone with benzaldehyde. The results demonstrated that the condensation reaction produced dibenzylideneacetone (DBA) in excellent yields under reasonably mild conditions. Owing to the presence of g-C3N4 nanosheets, MnFe2O4/gC(3)N(4) composite exhibited a larger specific surface area and also an inherent basic characteristic. The other key feature of the composite is its easy magnetic recovery. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Considering the effects of work hardening and thermal softening at high strain rates, the flow behavior is characterized by employing the modified Johnson-Cook (J-C) and Zerilli-Armstrong (Z-A) models. The triaxiality data showed the decrease in effective plastic strain at failure as triaxiality increases for all strain rates. Fracture constants have been evaluated. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB ZSM-22 zeolite samples were synthesized with and without the use of trimethoxyphenylsilane in conjunction with nanometric silica beads, producing materials with intracrystalline micro-mesopore structures. Subsequently, the solids were desilicated by varying the NaOH solution concentration. The XRD results indicated that the samples were highly crystalline and the nitrogen adsorption analysis showed that the desilication of the materials with the presence of organosilane caused a greater increase of surface area, external area, mesoporous volume, and higher yields of solid.

AB Intrinsic p-type NiO quantum dots were applied to study the thickness-dependent optical properties and photoelectrochemical performances. The reactive sputtering method was applied to grow quality NiO quantum dots (size of 5-7 nm) at a room-temperature for large-scale production. By controlling the NiO film thickness, the optical and photoelectrochemical features can be modulated, which are for the blue shift of band gap value (from 3.6 eV to 3.9 eV, Burstein-Moss shift), enhanced optical absorption, electrical conductivity, and a shift of flat band potential. A thin NiO film (50 nm) exhibited the same amount of photocurrent that of the 200 nm-thick NiO film. This strongly suggests the intensive light absorption property of the NiO film to illuminate of possibility of thin film uses. The transparent optical property and degenerate nature of NiO quantum dots will be a great interest to integrate them with low bandgap materials for the advantage of high light absorption and heterojunction for the water-splitting and hydrogen production.

A trade-off between efficiency and recombination is recently proposed by introducing a ratchet band just below the IB. In the present work, a single junction quantum dot (QD) IB cell is proposed by introducing a ratchet band (RB). The concept of carrier life time enhancement is also discussed by the help of RB. The validation of carrier life time enhancement is provided through the study of spectral response (SR), external quantum efficiency (EQE) and internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of the cell. The proposed model is simulated and the results are obtained using Silvaco ATLAS TCAD device simulator. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Effect of amorphous layer thickness on the tensile behavior of
   bulk-sized amorphous Ni-P/crystalline Ni laminates
SO MATERIALS LETTERS

DE Amorphous/crystalline laminates; Electrodeposition; Deformation and
   fracture; Thickness-dependent
ID DEFORMATION; SCALE
AB Bulk-sized laminates with controllable thicknesses for amorphous Ni-P and crystalline Ni layers were prepared by electrodeposition. A strong dependence of mechanical properties on the thickness of Ni-P layer was revealed. The laminates with thin Ni-P layers display a desirable combination of strength and ductility, which is even better than that of crystalline Ni. In this case, shear banding in Ni-P layers is suppressed with an effective constraint of Ni layers, resulting in ductile fracture of the laminates. With increase in Ni-P layer thickness, the dominant fracture mode of the laminate transits from codeformation of all layers to shear banding in the amorphous Ni-P layers, resulting in the reduced ductility and brittle fracture.

AB Conjugated derivative (CPVC) from thermal dehydrochlorination of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) was tried to modify SnO2 nanoparticles for developing a high efficiency visible-light-activated photocatalyst for the treatment of Cr(VI) wastewaters. CPVC modified SnO2 nanoparticles (SnO2/CPVC) were synthesized via the following procedures: (i) mixing of SnO2 nanoparticles and PVC in tetrahydrofuran solution, then evaporation of tetrahydrofuran to produce SnO2/PVC nanocomposite, and (ii) thermal treatment of the SnO2/PVC nanocomposite at 150 degrees C for 2 h to transform its PVC into conjugated CPVC. The as-synthesized products were characterized using X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, high resolution transmission electron microscopy, UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra, transient photocurrent measurement, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The photocatalytic tests indicated that SnO2/CPVC nanocomposite had exceptionally higher (about 14 times) photocatalytic activity than SnO2 nanoparticles in the reduction of aqueous Cr(VI) under visible-light (lambda > 420 nm) irradiation. This work is the first report of SnO2/CPVC as photocatalyst for the reduction of Cr(VI), and also useful for developing new efficient visible-light-activated photocatalysts using low cost polyvinyl chloride.

AB In this paper, the titanium (Ti) surfaces with different structure, composition, crystal form and grain size are prepared by micro arc oxidation and thermal treatment, and then their hydrophilicity and surface roughness are investigated. The experimental results show that there is no necessary relationship between hydrophilicity and surface roughness. For hydroxyapatite (HA) coatings with different surface structures, the structure with more HA amount has better hydrophilicity. And, with the same porous structure, HA surface endows better hydrophilicity than TiO2. Anatase surface with small grain size has better hydrophilicity and rutile has better hydrophilicity than anatase. Combined with their biological properties which have been well reported, the dependent relationship of hydrophilicity and biological properties can be concluded, namely the good biological properties can be obtained by improving the hydrophilicity. This research work sheds light on the methods for optimization of biological properties of the implant materials. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Sulfobetaine precursor of poly(BMA-co-DMAEMA) copolymer was first prepared by free radical polymerization of butyl methacrylate (BMA) and N, N-dimethylamino-2-ethyl methacrylate (DMAEMA) monomers. Then, the copolymer was coelectrospun with polyurethane to afford polyurethane/poly(BMA-co-DMAEMA) composite mats. The resultant mats were subsequently sulfobetainized to form zwitterions. The structure and morphology of mats were evaluated by ATR-FTIR, XPS, and SEM. The hemocompatibility and antifouling property of mats were preliminarily investigated by protein adsorption, platelet adhesion, and bacterial adhesion. The results indicated that the zwitterionic biocomposite mats could suppress protein adsorption, platelet adhesion, antibacterial adhesion as well as non-cytotoxicity. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The results indicated Zn-Ca alloys exhibited much stronger hardness and faster corrosion rate than those of pure Zn. And Zn-2Ca alloy presented the superior comprehensive performance with 90.94 +/- 1.71 HV, 0.074 +/- 0.010mm.y(-1) (weight loss) and 0.084 +/- 0.021 mm .y(-1) (polarization curve). And the element analysis indicated the corrosion products preferentially formed in the two-phase boundary and the main composition was calcium orthophosphate, which was the main constituent in human bone and teeth. Those results suggested Zn-Ca alloys, especial for Zn-2Ca alloy, would be promising as biodegradable implant material. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Adsorption technology has been widely employed to deal with wasterwater. In order to enhance adsorption rate and capacity, magnetic hollow mesoporous silica spheres (MHMSS) was synthesized by a facile solvothermal method, which SiO2 sheets assembled as the shell. Monodispersed nanosized Zn-doped Fe3O4 particles (about 2-3 nm) were synthesized on the SiO2 sheets. MHMSS exhibits superior adsorption capacity and high selectivity toward cationic dye of MB adsorption. Significantly, it took about only 1 min to reach the adsorption equilibrium. The experimental results indicate that this kind of structure may be a promising adsorbent for highly effective pollutant removing. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We report on the intercalation of a quaternary ammonium salt into MoS2 at ambient conditions and the rapid expansion of the resulting intercalated material - an analogue to expandable graphite - both via low temperature heating and via electron beam irradiation in a scanning electron microscope. In both cases the expansion proceeds within seconds and does not alter the material's chemical properties. The range of expansion under the electron beam depends on the energy and incident angle of the electrons. The intercalated material is air-stable and remains expandable for at least a year.

AB Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanohoneycombs were grown on the titanium dioxide (TiO2) layers of the photoanodes for dye sensitized solar cells (DSSC) via hydrothermal method at 93 degrees C for 5 h and then at 50 degrees C for 16 h. The photovoltaic performance of TiO2 based DSSCs with ZnO nanohoneycombs decorated photoanodes was investigated. Under the illumination of an air mass 1.5 solar simulator, the short-circuit current density of TiO2 based DSSCs with the decoration of ZnO nanohoneycombs was 21.48 mA/cm(2), which was higher than that of TiO2 based DSSCs without the decoration of nanohoneycombs (7.65 mA/cm(2)). The high specific surface area in ZnO nanohoneycombs enhances the power conversion efficiency (g) of the DSSCs. It is found that the g of the TiO2 based DSSCs is 5.85% in the presence of ZnO nanohoneycomb decoration but only 4.12% in the absence of ZnO nanohoneycomb decoration. The enhanced photovoltaic performance of DSSCs with ZnO nanohoneycombs decorated TiO2 photoanodes can be ascribed to the high specific surface area of ZnO nanohoneycombs and more efficient pathways for electron transportation from the electrolyte to the electrode.

The effect of layer by layer growth method on films morphology, crystal structure and magnetic properties were investigated. Xray diffraction 0-20 reveals the maximum thickness of oriented film was increased by layer-by-layer growth method. In addition, scanning electron microscopy displays excellent morphology with uniform size of grain for the film prepared under 2.4 mu m@800 nm condition. Magnetic hysteresis loops and FMR spectrum represent this layer-by-layer growth method can effective increase film saturation magnetization and decrease FMR linewidth. Specifically, oriented micron-thick (2.4 mu m) YIG film with only 12 Oe of FMR linewidth has been obtained by this layer-by-layer growth method.

DE Microstructure Powder technology; Near-infrared reflectivity; Thermal

AB Hollow tubular potassium magnesium titanate (KMTO) were synthesized using Mg(OH)(2), TiO(OH)(2) and K2CO3 as the raw materials and KCl as the flux. We studied the thermal stability of the KMTO and the reflectivity in the near-infrared wavelength range of KMTO treated at different temperatures. The results indicated that hollow tubular KMTO powders 4-15 mu m in length and 1-2 mu m in diameter could be obtained after being calclined at 850 degrees C for 2 h. The resulting KMTO powders had good thermal stability in structure and near-infrared reflectivity. Only a small amount of KMTO decomposed into MgTi2O5 and TiO2 when the as-calcined powders were post heat-treated at 1500 degrees C. Moreover, the high temperature treatment had only a minor effect on the high near-infrared reflectivities of KMTO. The results indicated that the prepared KMTO exhibited excellent thermal stability.

AB Silicon-based biomimetic surfaces with special wettabilities are difficult to be fabricated without lithographic techniques. In this report, superhydrophobic surfaces of porous silicon (PSi) with adjustable papillary microstructures have been prepared simply by electrochemical etching of n-type silicon, capillary driven surface texturing (CDST) of PSi films and surface modification. According to the results of FE-SEM and Drop Shape Analyzer, surface morphologies (from 2D pore structures to 3D papillary microstructures) and corresponding wettabilities (Contact angles, CAs: 134.8 degrees-158.9 degrees; Sliding angles, SAs: 180 degrees-1 degrees ) of PSi films can be adjusted efficiently by current density (< 20 mA cm (2)). The sizes and distribution of inverted-pyramid structures (IPSs) at the interfaces and symbiotic macropores in their centers are essential for such an adjustment. Considering the excellent biocompatibility of PSi, Such surfaces will be beneficial to the silicon-based biosensors, microarrays and microfluidics.

AB We present first-principle computational modelling of the perovskite CsSnxPb((1-x))I-3 (x = 0, 0.5 and 1), aimed at increasing the efficiency of perovskite photovoltaics. Using density functional theory calculations with a hybrid functional, we predict that both CsPbI3 and CsSnI3 are stable structures with direct bandgaps, suitable for photovoltaic application. On the other hand, the stable structure of CsSn0.5Pb0.5I3 exhibits an indirect bandgap, which could work as a direct bandgap due to the short electron-hole distance. The results of this study demonstrates that through bandgap engineering, we can obtain larger photon absorption ranges and higher efficiencies for perovskite based photovoltaics.

The purpose was to determine the NO oxidation under various working conditions. The features of fresh and used catalysts was analyzed according to XRD and XPS. In addition, the reaction conform to a pseudo-first order kinetics pattern on the basis of results. The rate constants was calculated by different results and the activation energy for the reaction was obtained as 32.07 kJ/mol.

AB In recent years, there is an increasing demand for more sensitive and high magnetoresistive materials in high-speed electronic and magnetic devices. La-1 xCaxMnO3 perovskites are chosen to be beneficial for the potential applications in solid oxide fuel cells, magnetic sensors/reading heads and frequency switching devices. La0.3Ca0.7MnO3 perovskites were prepared and sintered at four different temperatures such as 1173, 1273, 1373 and 1473 K. X-ray powder diffraction pattern confirms the existence of orthorhombic structure with Pnma space group in the perovskites. Scanning electron microscopy images of the perovskites were used to determine the size of the particles. In situ measurement of ultrasonic longitudinal velocity was carried out over a wide range of temperature. The ultrasonic measurements have shown an interesting anomaly at the metal-insulator phase transition. The metal insulator transition temperature is found to increase from 625 to 640 K with the increase of sintering temperature.

AB Orbital fractures are recognized as one of the most common types of facial bone fractures. Although surgical reconstruction techniques exist as a remedy for such fractures, prolonged complications, such as diplopia and gaze restriction, may still occur. This article proposes a simple technique for facial bone reconstruction though use of a thin-membrane patch made of the polycaprolactone-beta-tricalcium phosphate composite material. The application of the proposed technique is described by means of a surgical operation performed on an orbital fracture model of a rabbit taken as a subject. The thin-membrane patch was directly attached onto the fractured bone, and subsequently, microcomputed tomography was employed to assess the progress of fracture healing. Two such assessments were performed, respectively, 8 and 16 weeks after the surgical operation. Results of these assessments reveal a reduction in fracture volume and prevention of undesirable soft-issue filling in the membrane-patched groups. This indicates that the proposed thin membrane patch is able to secure space for the bones, thereby preventing the occurrence of an inflammatory response. The damaged area, however, was diagnosed to have been slightly filled up and blocked by the presence of unsuitable cells, such as immune cells. In a future study, the authors intend to synthesize thin membranes using alternate biological materials, such as stem cells, to improve the therapeutic result of the proposed technique for orbital fracture treatment.

AB In the present work, we prepared tin oxide/reduced graphene oxide (SnO2/RGO) nanocomposites by a Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) technique. Few layers of graphene oxide have been transferred on to a copper foil in which SnO2 nanoparticles were deposited at the air-water interface. The prepared nanocomposites were used as anode materials for lithium-ion batteries and their energy storage capacities were examined in the absence of a binder in a run through. The SnO2/RGO-1 nanocomposite exhibited remarkable discharge capacity of 1091 mAhg (1) at the first cycle and its columbic efficiency retained to 62.5% after 20 cycles. The enhanced storage capacity and cyclic stability with ordered layer architecture ensure the prominence of classical LB method among the electrode contriving techniques used in energy storage devices.

TI Fast synthesis of poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate cryogels via UV
   irradiation
SO MATERIALS LETTERS

DT Article
DE Biomaterials; Porous materials; Cryogel; Stiffness
AB Poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) cryogels, particularly useful for biotechnological applications, are currently fabricated exploiting crosslinking systems that require long freezing/crosslinking times (20 h or longer). The aim of this work was to assess whether fast UV irradiation (up to 60 s) of frozen PEGDA solutions could be an advantageous alternative for cryogel production. By using different polymer concentrations and UV times, cryogels with highly interconnected macropores (about 50-90 mu m) were produced. A gelation yield in the range 60-80% was recorded, with higher values obtained for low PEGDA concentrations (5 and 10% w/v). Interestingly, while decreasing the swelling and increasing the stiffness of the cryogels, a higher polymer concentration was also found to reduce the pore size. Furthermore, increasing the UV time resulted in significantly higher swelling and larger pores for 10% PEGDA samples, while having negligible effect on other cryogel types and/or features. Although deserving further exploration, fast UV irradiation is an effective method to produce PEGDA cryogels with tunable properties.

AB The oxygen nonstoichiometry of Ruddlesden-Popper type Sr3LaFe3O10-delta, a promising parent material for mixed-conducting electrodes and membranes, was studied in the oxygen partial pressure range from 10 (24) to 0.5 atm at 973-1223 K by coulometric titration and thermogravimetry. The p(O-2)-T-delta diagram can be described using a statistical thermodynamic model relating the non-ideal behavior in oxidizing and strongly reducing atmospheres to the coulombic interaction between oxygen vacancies and electronic charge carriers. The results confirm a strong energetic affinity of anion vacancies to the central perovskite-like layers of the Ruddlesden-Popper structure, whilst the difference between crystallographic iron sites has no significant effects on the oxygen intercalation thermodynamics at elevated temperatures. No indications of long-range ordering in the oxygen sublattice were observed.

AB Co-deposition of CuO and Mn1.5Co1.5O4 by single step electrophoretic deposition is used to produce similar to 15 mm coatings on Crofer22APU steel, which finds use as interconnect for high temperature solid oxide cells. Sintering of the green coatings in reducing and then oxidizing conditions led to formation of a mixed (Cu, Mn,Co)(3)O-4 spinel. By the incorporation of Cu, the density of the coatings improved. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy observations, supplemented with energy dispersive spectroscopy, confirmed dissolution of Cu in the spinel phase. For the un-doped Mn1.5Co1.5O4 both the tetragonal and cubic phases are detected at room temperature by X-ray diffractometry, whereas the addition of Cu seems to stabilize the cubic phase. Initial ( similar to 1000 h) high temperature corrosion evaluation at 800 degrees C in air showed promising properties of the mixed spinel coating.

AB The incorporation to construction materials is a potential solution for the recycling of silicon residues derived from the solar panels siliceous glass. Sepiolite is a fibrous clay mineral that, due to its physicochemical characteristics, imparts an exceptional white color to the ceramics. Due to high plasticity, the sepiolite should be mixed with complementary raw materials to allow its ceramic use. The aim of this work is to evaluate the suitability of sepiolite in clay brick production by using two siliceous materials as degreaser: diatomaceous earth and solar thermal glass waste. The siliceous materials reduce the plasticity of the sepiolite, provide strength and render these glass-ceramics an interesting material from the industrial point of view.

AB An imine linked dipodal organic receptor 1 is synthesized using condensation reaction between 2-aminothiophenol and 4-diethylaminosalicylaldehyde which is used as a capping agent over ZnO resulting in surface modified ZnO nanoparticles 1.ZnO. The conjugate 1.ZnO shows emission at 420 nm. The emission spectra obtained from surface modified ZnO nanoparticles is pure and sharp with full width half maximum (FWHM) 60 nm in comparison to emission spectra of pure ZnO which shows emission at 434 nm, 456 nm and 520 nm. It is demonstrated that organic receptor 1 acted as a capping monolayer over ZnO semiconductor as the surface defects that otherwise resulted in electronic transitions has not shown emission at various wavelengths in visible range. Thus the capping agent has successfully passivated the ZnO nanoparticles. The synthesized 1.ZnO nanoparticles can be used in active layer of light emitting diode providing blue emission at 420 nm.

AB Here we report the preparation of novel electrospun poly (beta-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) and poly(3-hydroxy butyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV)/organo-modified montmorillonite (OMMT) nanocomposite fibrous scaffolds. The incorporation of OMMT particles leads to significant amorphization of the deposited fibrous scaffolds and greatly improves the mechanical parameters. The addition of 5 wt% OMMT in the 12 wt% PHBV solution leads to predominant electrospinning and self-supporting 3D network fibrous scaffold formation. In the case of electrospun PHB mats, the addition of OMMT particles leads to significant reduction of average fiber diameter and formation of surface clay filled pore structure.

AB Unsaturated elliptical P-E hysteresis loops in sodium para-nitrophenolate dihydrate single crystal and its Fe3+ doped analogue are due to dielectric loss not to ferroelectric properties. Dielectric anomaly at 28 degrees C does not correspond to a ferroelectric phase transition. Initial polarity for piezoelectric single crystals is not necessary. The doping can not cause over 10-fold increase in the value of the piezoelectric coefficient.

AB This article is in response to the comments raised on our paper "Remarkable enhancement in dielectric, piezoelectric, ferroelectric and SHG properties by iron doping in sodium para-nitrophenolate dihydrate single crystal" published in Materials Letters (Dalal and Kumar, 2016 [1]). In the ferroelectric studies, we performed PUND studies to establish that an unsaturated P-E loop may also contain intrinsic ferroelectric polarization. In dielectric studies, it has been shown that the variation did follow Curie-Wiess law confirming the transition to be related to ferroelectric to paraelectric phase. In respect of the comment on piezoelectric enhancement, it has been shown that the achieved enhancement in d33-value due to Fe-doping is well within the possible change in piezo-response by doping in different types of systems.

AB Noroviruses cause significant global health burdens and waterborne transmission is a known exposure pathway. Chlorination is the most common method of disinfection for water and wastewater worldwide. The purpose of this study was to investigate the underlying causes for discrepancies in human norovirus (hNoV) resistance to free chlorine that have been previously published, and to assess hNoV GI and GII persistence during disinfection of municipal secondary wastewater (WW) effluent. Our results reveal that choice of hNoV purification methodology prior to seeding the viruses in an experimental water matrix influences disinfection outcomes in treatment studies. Common hNoV purification processes such as solvent extraction and 0.45-mu m filtration were ineffective in removing high levels of organics introduced into water or wastewater samples when seeding norovirus positive stool. These methods resulted in experimental water matrices receiving an additional 190 mg/L as Cl-2 of 15-s chlorine demand and approximately 440 mg/L as Cl-2 of 30-min chlorine demand due to seeding norovirus positive stool at 1% w/v. These high Organic loads impact experimental water chemistry and bias estimations of hNoV persistence. Advanced purification of norovirus positive stool using sucrose cushion ultracentrifugation and ultrafiltration reduced 15-s chlorine demands by 99% and TOC by 93% for loose (i.e. unformed diarrhea) stools. Using these methods, hNoV GI and GII persistence was investigated during free chlorination of municipal WW. A suite five of kinetic inactivation models was fit to viral reverse transcription-qPCR reduction data, and model predicted CT values for 1, 2, and 3 log(10) reduction of hNoV GI in municipal WW by free chlorine were 0.3, 2.1, and 7.8 mg-min/L, respectively. Model predicted CT values for reduction of hNoV GII in WW were 0.4, 2.0, and 7.0 mg-min/L, respectively. These results indicate that current WW treatment plant disinfection practices employing free chlorine are likely protective for public health with regards to noroviruses, and will achieve at least 3-log reduction of hNoV GI and GII RNA despite previous reports of high hNoV resistance.

AB The relative ratios of chemical oxygen demand (COD) to nitrogen (N) in wastewater are known to have profound effects on the characteristics of soluble microbial products (SMP) from activated sludge. In this study, the changes in the SMP characteristics upon different COD/N ratios and the subsequent effects on ultrafiltration (UF) membrane fouling potentials were examined in sequencing batch reactors (SBR) using excitation emission matrix-parallel factor analysis (EEM-PARAFAC) and size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Three unique fluorescent components were identified from the SMP samples in the bioreactors operated at the COD/N ratios of 100/10 (N rich), 100/5 (N medium), and 100/2 (N deficient). The tryptophan-like component (C1) was the most depleted at the N medium condition. Fulvic-like (C2) and humic-like (C3) components were more abundant with N rich wastewater. Greater abundances of large size biopolymer (BP) and low molecular weight neutrals (LMWN) were found under the N deficient and N rich conditions, respectively. SMPs from various COD/N exhibited a greater degree on membrane fouling following the order of 100/2 > 100/10 > 100/5. C1 and C2 had close associations with reversible and irreversible fouling, respectively, while the reversible fouling potential of C3 depended on the COD/N ratios. No significant impact of COD/N ratio was observed on the relative contributions of SMP size fractions to either reversible or irreversible fouling potential. However, the COD/N ratios likely altered the BP foulants' composition with greater contribution of proteinaceous substances to reversible fouling under the N deficient condition than at other N richer conditions. The opposite trend was observed for irreversible fouling. Our results provided further insight into changes in different SMP constitutes and their membrane fouling in response to microbial activities under different COD/N ratios. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The corrosion of zero valent iron (ZVI) by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) generates hydroxyl (center dot OH) and other radical oxygen species (ROS) that degrade organic materials. To better understand the factors that govern the ROS formation during the. H2O2-induced corrosion, we investigated the degradation of an organic probe compound (acesulfame (ACE)) in slurries of ZVI powder in unbuffered laboratory water at pH 6.5 +/- 0.5. Chloride ions accelerated the corrosion of ZVI by H2O2 and the formation ROS and, therefore, the degradation of organic materials. Conversely, slowing corrosion by phosphate buffer inhibited ROS formation and the degradation of organic compounds. The rate of H2O2 decomposition was correlated with the liberation of Fe2+(aq) and the ACE degradation rate. The kinetics of H2O2 decomposition was pseudo-first-order and zero-order at low (<0.04 mMimg) and high [H2O2]/[ZVI] initial ratios, respectively, and was consistent with Langmuir kinetics. The H2O2 decomposition rate was proportional to the ZVI reactive surface area (SA) and nearly independent of the extent of ZVI oxidation, the presence of a Fe2+(aq) chelating agent, and center dot OH quenchers (methanol and tert-butanol). Kinetic data suggest a mechanism involving rapid cathodic reduction of H2O2 at the metallic ZVI surface which causes the liberation of Fe2+(aq) that generate center dot OH via the homogeneous Fenton reaction. The stoichiometric efficiency (SE) of organics degradation ranged from 0.0008% to 0.014% and increased with decreasing H2O2 decomposition rate. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, the performance Of graphene oxide (GO) in Ozonation process was kinetically evaluated using the modified R-ct concept since GO may act as initiator, promoter and inhibitor in ozone radical chain reaction. The applicability of the modified R-ct concept was demonstrated using different GO suspensions (GO alone, GO/TiO2, GO/Fe3O4, GO/TiO2/Fe3O4) in ozonation process. Results showed that ozone exposure and center dot OH exposure were found to be higher for GO/Fe3O4 and GO/TiO2/Fe3O4 compared to other GO suspensions, which was almost equivalent to O-3/H2O2 process. The determined initiation and inhibition rate constants of GO alone, were 1 fold higher than GO/Fe3O4 and GO/TiO2/Fe3O4, since the GO alone suspension possesses higher O-3 decomposition but lower organic degradation because that GO does not yield center dot OH. Moreover, GO/Fe3O4 suspension, along with natural organic matter (NOM), was proven to be helpful in degrading ibuprofen in ozonation process, but the effect was minimal when compared to O-3/H2O2 process. These results exhibited that the surface modified GO suspensions could be utilized as future alternative AOPs. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The global proliferation of harmful algal blooms poses an increasing threat to water resources, recreation and ecosystems. Predicting the occurrence of these blooms is therefore needed to assist water managers in making management decisions to mitigate their impact. Evaluation of the potential for forecasting of algal blooms using the phytoplankton community model PROTECH was undertaken in pseudo-real-time. This was achieved within a data assimilation scheme using the Ensemble Kalman Filter to allow uncertainties and model nonlinearities to be propagated to forecast outputs. Tests were made on two mesotrophic lakes in the English Lake District, which differ in depth and nutrient regime. Some forecasting success was shown for chlorophyll a, but not all forecasts were able to perform better than a persistence forecast. There was a general reduction in forecast skill with increasing forecasting period but forecasts for up to four or five days showed noticeably greater promise than those for longer periods. Associated forecasts of phytoplankton community structure were broadly consistent with observations but their translation to cyanobacteria forecasts was challenging owing to the interchangeability of simulated functional species.

AB Xanthan gum is widely used as a model fluid for sludge to mimic the rheological behaviour under various conditions including impact of gas injection in sludge. However, there is no study to show the influence of gas injection on rheological properties of xanthan gum specifically at the concentrations at which it is used as a model fluid for sludge with solids concentration above 2%.
   In this paper, the rheological properties of aqueous xanthan gum solutions at different concentrations were measured over a range of gas injection flow rates: The effect of gas injection on both the flow and viscoelastic behaviour of Xanthan gum (using two different methods - a creep test and a time sweep test) was evaluated. The viscosity curve of different solid concentrations of digested sludge and waste activated sludge were compared with different solid concentrations of Xanthan gum and the results showed that Xanthan gum can mimic the flow behaviour of sludge in flow regime.
   The results in linear viscoelastic regime showed that increasing gas flow rate increases storage modulus (G'), indicating an increase in the intermolecular associations within the material structure leading to an increase in material strength and solid behaviour. Similarly, in creep test an increase in the gas flow rate decreased strain%, signifying that the material has become more resistant to flow. Both observed behaviour is opposite to what occurs in sludge under similar conditions.
   The results of both the creep test and the time sweep test indicated that choosing Xanthan gum aqueous solution as a transparent model fluid for sludge in viscoelastic regime under similar conditions involving gas injection in a concentration range studied is not feasible. However Xanthan gum can be used as a model material for sludge in flow regime; because it shows a similar behaviour to sludge. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Wastewater treatment plants have widely been, described as a significant source of odour nuisance, which has led to an increase of neighbourhood complaints. Therefore, to mitigate the negative impact of odours, the detection and analysis of these emissions are required. This paper presents a measurement system based on an electronic nose for quantitative and qualitative odour analysis of samples collected from six different stages on a wastewater plant. Hence, two features vectors were performed in order to represent quantitative trends of the gaseous mixture sampled on the facility. in addition, odour fingerprints and a PCA were computed to discriminate odours from its sources and to detect relationships among the samples. This approach also comprises a dynamic dilution olfactometer. A PLS regression model was performed to predict the odour concentration by the electronic nose in term of odour units per cubic meter. The results show that the developed electronic nose is a promising and feasible instrument to characterize odours from wastewater plants. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Ozonation can be applied to mitigate the discharge of organic micropollutants from municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) to the aquatic environment. The toxicity of metals also present in WWTP effluents strongly depends on their speciation. Therefore, knowledge on the change of the metal speciation during ozonation of a WWTP effluent is essential to assess possible negative impacts. The kinetics and the stoichiometries of the tseactions of ozone with three metal sulfides (ZnS, CuS and CdS) and metal-ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA)/nitriloriacetic acid (NTA) complexes of Cu(II), Cd(II), Ni(II), Zn(II), Mg(II) and Pb(II) were investigated. With a stoichiometric factor of 2.6-3.9 moles of ozone per mole of sulfide and apparent second order rate constants at pH 8 > 10(4) M-1 s(-1), a complete oxidation of the sulfides and a concomitant release of the respective metals is expected during ozonation of a WWTP effluent for enhanced micropollutant abatement. The apparent second-order rate constants at pH 8 for the reactions of metal-EDTA complexes with ozone ranged from 42 M(-1)s(-1) to 2.0 x 10(4) M(-1)s(-1) and increased in the order Cd(II) < Cu(II) < Mg(II) < Ni(II)< Zn(II). Approximately 40% of Cd(II)-EDTA spiked to a WWTP effluent was oxidized at typical specific ozone doses of 0.5-0.7 go3/gDoc. For the other metal-EDTA complexes a significantly higher fraction was oxidized. The bioavailable fraction determined by the diffusive-gradient thin films (DGT) method in the WWTP effluent increased during ozonation, due to the oxidative release of the metal ions. Algal toxicity (chlamynomodas reinhardtii) tests with CuS/CdS spiked WWTP effluent revealed a high tolerance toward Cu and Cd in the respective media. A toxic response was only observed at Cu concentrations above 10 IN, which is above typical WWTP effluent concentrations. Biological post-treatment after,ozonation generally reduced the bioavailability of the metals, which resulted in a lower toxicity. Therefore, Lhebiological posttreatment serves as an additional barrier to protect the downstream ecology of receiving waters. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The present research is the first comprehensive study regarding the thermophilic anaerobic degradation of cheese wastewater, which combines the evaluation of different reactor configurations (i.e. single and two-stage continuous stirred tank reactors) on the process efficiency and the in-depth characterization of the microbial community structure using genome-centric metagenomics. Both reactor configurations showed acidification problems under the tested organic loading rates (OLRs) of 3.6 and 2.4 g COD/Lreactor day and the hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 15 days. However, the two-stage design reached a methane yield equal to.95% of the theoretical value, in contrast with the single stage configuration, which reached a maximum of 33% of the theoretical methane yield. The metagenomic analysis identified 22 new population genomes and revealed that the microbial compositions between the two configu' rations were remarkably' different, demonstrating a higher methanogenic biodiversity in the two-stage configuration. In fact, the acidogenic reactor of the serial configuration was almost solely composed by the lactose degrader Bifidobacterium crudilactis UC0001. The predictive functional analyses of the main population genomes 'highlighted specific metabolic pathways responsible for the AD process and the mechanisms of main intermediates production. Particularly, the acetate accumulation experienced by the single stage configuration was mainly correlated to the low abundant syntrophic acetate oxidizer Tepidanaerobacter acetatoxydans UC0018 and to the absence of aceticlastic methanogens.

AB The prevalence of antibiotic resistance in the modern world has raised global concerns for public health. Establishing relationships between antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) is essential to understanding the dissemination and accumulation of ARGs in a human-impacted environment. In this study, ARG profiles in the sediments from a bullfrog farm, where penicillin and amoxicillin (beta-lactams) and gentamicin (aminoglycoside) were used for prophylactic purposes, were analyzed using metagenomic approaches. Analysis of both extracellular and intracellular DNA (eDNA and iDNA) demonstrated that use of the above-mentioned antibiotics led to complex pollution of ARGs not only related to beta-lactams and aminoglycoside but also to sulfonamides, tetracyclines, and macrolides. Most of the ARGs in the sediments from the bullfrog farm were likely carried by plasmids. A significant correlation was observed between the total abundance of ARG-related plasmids and that of plasmid-carrying ARGs. Approximately 85% of the plasmids likely present in the sediment from the bullfrog farm possessed at least 3 ARG subtypes, which conferred the resistance of bacterial hosts to different antibiotic categories. Our results suggest that antibiotics could lead to complex pollution of ARGs unrelated to those administered due to the concurrence of ARGs in the plasmids. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Hydrogen has been found to be an important intermediate during anaerobic digestion (AD) and a key variable for process monitoring as it gives valuable information about the stability of the reactor. However, simple dynamic models describing the evolution of hydrogen are not. commonplace. In this work, such a dynamic model is derived using a systematic data driven-approach, which consists of a principal component analysis to deduce the dimension of the minimal reaction subspace explaining the data, followed by an identification of the kinetic parameters in the least-squares sense. The procedure requires the availability of informative data sets. When the available data does not fulfill this condition, the model can still be built from simulated data, obtained using a detailed model such as ADM1. This dynamic model could be exploited in monitoring and control applications after a re-identification of the parameters using actual process data. As an example, the model is used in the framework of a control strategy, and is also fitted to experimental data from raw industrial wine processing wastewater. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Increased attention has been devoted to opportunistic pathogens, especially Legionella pneumophila, due to its growing importance as a portion of the waterborne disease burden in the United States, Infection occurs when a person inhales a mist containing Legionella bacteria. The top three uses for reclaimed water (cooling towers, spray irrigation, and toilet flushing) that generate aerosols were evaluated for Legionella health risks in reclaimed water using quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA). Risks are compared using data from nineteen United States reclaimed water utilities measured with culture-based methods, quantitative PCR (qPCR), and ethidium-monoazide-qPCR. Median toilet flushing annual infection risks exceeded 10(-4) considering multiple toilet types, while median clinical severity infection risks did not exceed this value. Sprinkler and cooling tower risks varied depending on meteorological conditions and operational characteristics such as drift eliminator performance. However, the greatest differences between risk scenarios were due to 1) the dose response model used (infection or clinical severity infection) 2) population at risk considered (residential or occupational) and 3) differences in laboratory analytical method. Theoretical setback distances necessary to achieve a median annual infection risk level of 10(-4) are proposed for spray irrigation and cooling towers. In both cooling tower and sprinkler cases, Legionella infection risks were non-trivial at potentially large setback distances, and indicate other simultaneous management practices could be needed to manage risks. The sensitivity analysis indicated that the most influential factors for variability in risks were the concentration of Legionella and aerosol partitioning and/or efficiency across all models, highlighting the importance of strategies to manage Legionella occurrence in reclaimed water.

AB This study investigates the functional correspondence between porescale hydrodynamics, mass transfer, pore structure and biofilm morphology during progressive biofilm colonization of a porous medium. Hydrodynamics and the structure of both the porous medium and the biofilm are experimentally measured with 3D particle tracking Velocimetry and micro X-ray. Computed Tomography, respectively. The analysis focuses on data obtained in a clean porous medium after 36 h of biofilm growth. Registration of the particle tracking and X-ray data sets allows to delineate the interplay between porous medium geometry, hydrodynamic and mass transfer processes on the morphology of the developing biofilm. A local analysis revealed wide distributions of wall shear stresses and concentration boundary layer thicknesses. The spatial distribution of the biofilm patches uncovered that the wall shear stresses controlled the biofilm development. Neither,external nor internal mass transfer limitations were noticeable in the considered system, consistent with the excess supply of nutrient and electron acceptors. The wall shear stress remained constant in the vicinity of the biofilm but increased substantially elsewhere. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Due to the extensive existence of tetracyclines (TCs), struvite (MgNH4PO4 center dot 6H(2)O) recovery from swine wastewater will pose TCs-pharmacological threats to the agricultural planting and environment. This study investigated the influences of dissolved organic matters (DOM), as an important medium in the wastewater, on TCs transport during struvite recovery from swine wastewater. Compared to TCs concentrations of 1.49-2.16 mu g/g in the solids obtained from synthetic wastewater, the existence of DOM significantly enhanced TCs contents in the products with the values of 360-742 mu g/g. DOM was fractionated into four size fractions with different molecular weight cut-off, i.e. FDOM1 (30 kDa-0.45 mu m), FDOM2 (5-30 kDa), FDOM3 (1-5 kDa) and FDOM4 (<1 kDa). Results revealed that the destabilization and aggregation Of FDOM1 and FDOM2 contributed major roles to TCs transport from the aqueous phase to the solid products. Meanwhile, the hydrolysis of certain parts of FDOM1 and FDOM2 led to the aqueous TCs re-partition among various DOM constituents, which presented a false appearance that FDOM4 with smaller molecular weight posed significant influences on TCs transport. Increasing pH values from 8.5 to 10.5 resulted with a stepwise increase of precipitated DOM, thereby enhancing TCs concentrations from 94.5 to 292.4 mu g/g to 627.2-825.0 mu g/g in the recovered solids. The outcomes provide a better understanding on the capability of DOM on TCs transport and abatement in the phosphate recovery process. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB As part of long-term monitoring of Cryptosporidium in water catchments serving Western Australia, New South Wales (Sydney) and Queensland, Australia, we characterised Cryptosporidium in a total of 5774 faecal samples from 17 known host species and 7 unknown bird samples, in 11 water catchment areas over a period of 30 months (July 2013 to December 2015). All samples were initially screened for Cryptosporidium spp. at the 18S rRNA locus using a quantitative PCR (qPCR). Positives samples were then typed by sequence analysis of an 825 bp fragment of the 18S gene and subtyped at the glycoprotein 60 (gp60) locus (832 bp). The overall prevalence of Cryptosporidium across the various hosts sampled was 18.3% (1054/5774; 95% CI, 17.3-19.3). Of these, 873 samples produced clean Sanger sequencing chromatograms, and the remaining 181 samples, which initially produced chromatograms suggesting the presence of multiple different sequences, were re-analysed by Next- Generation Sequencing (NGS) to resolve the presence of Cryptosporidium and the species composition of potential mixed infections. The overall prevalence of confirmed mixed infection was 1.7% (98/5774), and in the remaining 83 samples, NGS only detected one species of Cryptosporidium. Of the 17 Cryptosporidium species and four genotypes detected (Sanger sequencing combined with NGS), 13 are capable of infecting humans; C parvum, C hominis, C ubiquitum, C cuniculus, C meleagridis, C canis, C. fells, C muris, C suis, C scrofarum, C bovis, C erinacei and C fayeri. Oocyst numbers per gram of faeces (g(-1)) were also determined using qPCR, with medians varying from 6021-61,064 across the three states. The significant findings were the detection of C hominis in cattle and kangaroo faeces and the high prevalence of C parvum in cattle. In addition, two novel C fayeri subtypes (1VaA11G3T1 and 1VgA10G1T1R1) and one novel C meleagridis subtype (IIIeA18G2R1) were identified. This is also the first report of C. erinacei in Australia. Future work to monitor the prevalence of Cryptosporidium species and subtypes in animals in these catchments is warranted. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Two major performance bottlenecks with decision tree based classifiers in a data stream environment are the depth of the tree and the update overhead of maintaining leaf node statistics on an instance-wise basis to ensure that classification is consistent with the current state of the data stream. Previous research has shown that classifiers based on Fourier spectra derived from decision trees produce compact array structures that can be searched and maintained much more efficiently than deep tree based structures. However, the key issue of incrementally adapting the spectrum to changes has not been addressed. In this research we present a strategy for incremental maintenance of the Fourier spectrum to changes in concept that take place in data stream environments. Along with the incremental approach we also propose schemes for feature selection and synopsis generation that enable the coefficient array to be refreshed efficiently on a periodic basis. Our empirical evaluation on a number of widely used stream classifiers reveals that the Fourier classifier outperforms them, both in terms of classification accuracy as well as speed of classification.

DE Adversarial machine learning; Concept drift; Streaming data; Limited
   labeling; Active learning; Classification
ID MULTIPLE CLASSIFIER SYSTEMS; SECURITY
AB Classifiers operating in a dynamic, real world environment, are vulnerable to adversarial activity, which causes the data distribution to change over time. These changes are traditionally referred to as concept drift, and several approaches have been developed in literature to deal with the problem of drift detection and handling. However, most concept drift handling techniques approach it as a domain independent task, to make them applicable to a wide gamut of reactive systems. These techniques are developed from an adversarial agnostic perspective, where they naively assume that adversarial activity is like any other change to the data, which can be fixed by retraining the models. However, this is not the case when a malicious agent is trying to evade the deployed classification system. In such an environment, the properties of concept drift are unique, as the drift is intended to degrade the system and at the same time designed to avoid detection by traditional concept drift detection techniques. This special category of drift is termed as adversarial drift, and this paper analyzes its characteristics and impact in a streaming environment. A novel framework for dealing with adversarial concept drift is proposed, called the Predict-Detect streaming framework. This framework uses adversarial forethought and incorporates the context of classification into the drift detection task, to provide leverage in dynamic-adversarial domains. Experimental evaluation of the framework, on generated adversarial drifting data streams, demonstrates that this framework is able to provide early and reliable unsupervised indication of drift, and is able to recover from drifts swiftly. While traditional drift detectors can be evaded by intelligent adversaries, the proposed framework is especially designed to capture adversaries by misdirecting them into revealing themselves. In addition, the framework is designed to work on imbalanced and sparsely labeled data streams, as a limited-memory, incremental algorithm. The generic design and domain independent nature of the framework makes it applicable as a blueprint for developers wanting to implement reactive security to their classification based systems.

AB Disease spreading models need a population model to organize how individuals are distributed over space and how they are connected. Usually, disease agent (bacteria, virus) passes between individuals through these connections and an epidemic outbreak may occur. Here, complex networks models, like Erclos-Wenyi, Small-World, Scale-Free and Barabasi-Albert will be used for modeling a population, since they are used for social networks; and the disease will be modeled by a SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) model. The objective of this work is, regardless of the network/population model, analyze which topological parameters are more. relevant for a disease success or failure. Therefore, the SIR model is simulated in a wide range of each network model and a first analysis is done. By using data from all simulations, an investigation with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is done in order to find the most relevant topological and disease parameters. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In the recent times, a huge amount of text is being generated for social purposes on twitter social networking site. Summarizing and analysing of twitter content is an important task as it benefits many applications such as information retrieval, automatic indexing, automatic classification, automatic clustering, automatic filtering etc. One of the most important tasks in analyzing tweets is automatic keyword extraction. There are some graph based approaches for keyword extraction which determine keywords only based on centrality measure. However, the importance of a keyword in twitter depends on various parameters such as frequency, centrality, position and strength of neighbors of the keyword. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel unsupervised graph based keyword extraction method called Keyword Extraction using Collective Node Weight (KECNW) which determines the importance of a keyword by collectively taking various influencing parameters. The KECNW is based on Node Edge rank centrality with node weight depending on various parameters. The model is validated with five datasets: Uri Attack, American Election, Harry Potter, IPL and Donald Trump. The result of KECMW is compared with three existing models. It is observed from the experimental results that the proposed method is far better than the others. The performances are shown in terms of precision, recall and F-measure.

AB This paper proposes a novel stock price trend prediction system that can predict both stock price movement and its interval of growth (or decline) rate within the predefined prediction durations. It utilizes an unsupervised heuristic algorithm to cut raw transaction data of each stock into multiple clips with the predefined fixed length and classifies them into four main classes (Up, Down, Flat, and Unknown) according to the shapes of their close prices. The clips in Up and Down can be further classified into different levels reflecting the extents of their growth (or decline) rates with respect to both close price and relative return rate. The features of clips include their prices and technical indices. The prediction models are trained from these clips by a combination of random forests, imbalance learning and feature selection. Evaluations on the seven-year Shenzhen Growth Enterprise Market (China) transaction data show that the proposed system can make effective predictions, is robust to the market volatility, and outperforms some existing methods in terms of accuracy and return per trade.

AB Recommendation System (RS) is a piece of software that gives suggestions according to the interest of users in many domains like products in e-commerce, tours, hotels, entertainment etc. In any of the established e-commerce website hundreds of products are available under the same category. RS helps buyers to find the right product based on buyer's past buying pattern and item information. Currently many established approaches for item recommendations like content based filtering, collaborative filtering, matrix factorization, etc., exist. All these approaches create a big list of item recommendations for the target user. In general most users prefer to see only top-n recommendations, where the value of n is small and just ignores remaining recommendations. It means good RS must have high precision value for smaller values of n but at present almost all recommendation systems to the best of authors' knowledge are having high recall value and low precision value. It clearly means that top-n recommendations generated by these systems have very few items that may be liked by the target user. The proposed approach generates recommendations by combining features of content based filtering, collaborative filtering, matrix factorization and opinion mining. The proposed RS dynamically keeps track of user's inclination towards different types of items with respect to time. It analyzes user's opinions about products and finds the product popularity in the market by its own unique way. In the proposed approach, items are arranged in such a way that almost all preferred items by target user comes under top-n recommendations. The experimental results show that top-n recommendations generated by the proposed approach for smaller value of n have high precision value when compared with other traditional benchmark recommendation methods.

AB The QArt-Learn approach for style painting categorization based on Qualitative Color Descriptors (QCD), color similarity (SimQCD), and quantitative global features (i.e. average of brightness, hue, saturation and lightness and brightness contrast) is presented in this paper. k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) and support vector machine (SVM) techniques have been used for learning the features of paintings from the Baroque, Impressionism and Post-Impressionism styles. Specifically two classifiers are built, and two different parameterizations have been applied for the QCD. For testing QArt-Learn approach, the Painting-91 dataset has been used, from which the paintings corresponding to Velazquez, Vermeer, Monet, Renoir, van Gogh and Gauguin were extracted, resulting in a set of 252 paintings. The results obtained have shown categorization accuracies higher than 65%, which are comparable to accuracies obtained in the literature. However, QArt-Learn uses qualitative color names which can describe style color palettes linguistically, so that they can be better understood by non-experts in art since QCDs are aligned with human perception.

AB This work describes the addition of relational calculus languages in the deductive database system DES. Based on first-order logic, such languages admit a clean logical reading of queries, providing truly declarativeness, in contrast to other languages based on logic such as Prolog (a classical language used to build expert systems). Interesting properties as termination (for finite relations) and recursion are ensured because the DES deductive engine is used for solving relational calculus queries. Recursion in particular opens a brand new ream of applications (social networks, data warehouses,...) for relational calculus languages which were unmanageable up to now. Since the DES system was targeted at teaching, we have also make a special emphasis on providing a practical system for students by providing appropriate syntax error feedback in a system supporting different languages (including relational algebra, SQL and Datalog).

AB In this article, a local change detection technique for underwater video sequences is proposed to detect the positions of the moving objects. The proposed change detection scheme integrates the Mixture of Gaussian (MoG) process in a Wronskian framework. It uses spatiotemporal modes (an integration of spatio-contextual and temporal modes) arising over the underwater video sequences to detect the local changes. The Wronskian framework takes care of the spatio-contextual modes whereas MoG models the temporal modes arising due to inter-dependency of a pixel in a video. The proposed scheme follows two steps: background construction and background subtraction. It takes initial few frames to construct a background model and thereby detection of the moving objects in the subsequent frames. During background construction stage; the linear dependency test between the region of supports/ local image patch in the target image frame and the reference background model are carried out using the Wronskian change detection model. The pixel values those are linearly dependent are assumed to be generated from an MoG process and are modeled using the same. Once the background is constructed, then the background subtraction and update process starts from the next frame. The efficiency of the proposed scheme is validated by testing it on two benchmark underwater video databases: fish4knowledge and underwater-changedetection and one large scale outdoor video database: changedetection.net. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated by comparing it with eighteen state-of-the-art local change detection algorithms. The performance of the proposed scheme is carried out using one subjective and three quantitative evaluation measures. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Expert and intelligent systems understand the underlying information behind the data by relying on a wide range of machine learning techniques. The interpretation of machine learning models is often the key to success in research areas such as business, finance, medical and health science, and bioinformatics; such research areas demand human understanding of the obtained model. The logistic model tree (LMT) algorithm is a popular classification method that combines a decision tree and logistic regression models. The combination of two complementary algorithms produces an accurate and interpretable classifier by combining the advantages of both logistic regression and tree induction. However, LMT has the disadvantage of high computational cost, which makes the algorithm undesirable in practice. In this paper, we propose an efficient method to learn the logistic regression models in the tree. We employ least angle regression to update the regression model in LogitBoost so that the algorithm efficiently learns sparse logistic regression models composed of relevant input variables. We compare the performance of our proposed method with the original LMT algorithm using 14 benchmark datasets and show that the training time dramatically decreases while the accuracy is preserved. Our proposed algorithm is not only accurate and intuitively interpretable but also computationally efficient. It helps users in making the best possible use of the data that are included in expert and intelligent systems. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study proposes a methodology for market basket analysis based on minimum spanning trees, which complements the search for significant association rules among the vast set of rules that usually characterize such an analysis. Thanks to the hierarchical tree structure of the subdominant ultrametric distances of the MST, the association network allows us to find strong interdependencies between products in the same category, and to find products that serve as accesses or bridges to a set of other products with a high correlation among themselves. One relevant aspect of this graph-based methodology is the ease with which pairs and groups of products susceptible to carrying out marketing actions can be identified. The application of our methodology to a real transactional database succeeded in: 1. revealing product interdependencies with the greatest strengths, 2. revealing products of high importance with access to another product set, 3. determining high quality association rules, and 4. detect clusters and taxonomic relations among supermarket subcategories. This is highly beneficial for a retail manager or for a retail analyst who must propose different promotion and offer activities in order to maximize the sales volume and increase the effectiveness of promotion campaigns.

AB This paper proposes an approach KeyRank to extract proper keyphrases from a document in English. It first searches all keyphrase candidates from the document, and then ranks them for selecting top-N ones as final keyphrases. Existing studies show that extracting a complete keyphrase candidate set that includes semantic relations in context, and evaluating the effectiveness of each candidate are crucial to extract high quality keyphrases from documents. Based on that words do not repeatedly appear in an effective keyphrase in English, a novel keyphrase candidate search algorithm using sequential pattern mining with gap constraints (called KCSP) is proposed to extract keyphrase candidates for KeyRank. And then an effectiveness evaluation measure pattern frequency with entropy (called PF-H) is proposed for KeyRank to rank these keyphrase candidates. Our experimental results show that KeyRank has better performance. Its first component KCSP is much more efficient than a closely related approach SPMW, and its second component PF-H is an effective evaluation mechanism for ranking keyphrase candidates.(1) (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper provides an evaluation of the predictive performance of the volatility of three cryptocurrencies and three currencies with recognized stores of value using daily and hourly frequency data. We combined the traditional GARCH model with the machine learning approach to volatility estimation, estimating the mean and volatility equations using Support Vector Regression (SVR) and comparing to GARCH family models. Furthermore, the models' predictive ability was evaluated using Diebold-Mariano test and Hansen's Model Confidence Set. The analysis was reiterated for both low and high frequency data. Results showed that SVR-GARCH models managed to outperform GARCH, EGARCH and GJR-GARCH models with Normal, Student's t and Skewed Student's t distributions. For all variables and both time frequencies, the SVR-GARCH model exhibited statistical significance towards its superiority over GARCH and its extensions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Recommender systems use algorithms to provide users with product or service recommendations. Recently, these systems have been using machine learning algorithms from the field of artificial intelligence. However, choosing a suitable machine learning algorithm for a recommender system is difficult because of the number of algorithms described in the literature. Researchers and practitioners developing recommender systems are left with little information about the current approaches in algorithm usage. Moreover, the development of recommender systems using machine learning algorithms often faces problems and raises questions that must be resolved. This paper presents a systematic review of the literature that analyzes the use of machine learning algorithms in recommender systems and identifies new research opportunities. The goals of this study are to (i) identify trends in the use or research of machine learning algorithms in recommender systems; (ii) identify open questions in the use or research of machine learning algorithms; and (iii) assist new researchers to position new research activity in this domain appropriately. The results of this study identify existing classes of recommender systems, characterize adopted machine learning approaches, discuss the use of big data technologies, identify types of machine learning algorithms and their application domains, and analyzes both main and alternative performance metrics.

AB Random Forest (RF) learning algorithm is considered a classifier of reference due its excellent performance. Its success is based on the diversity of rules generated from decision trees that are built via a procedure that randomizes instances and features. To find additional procedures for increasing the diversity of the trees is an interesting task. It has been considered a new split criterion, based on imprecise probabilities and general uncertainty measures, that has a clear dependence of a parameter and has shown to be more successful than the classic ones. Using that criterion in RF scheme, join with a random procedure to select the value of that parameter, the diversity of the trees in the forest and the performance are increased. This fact gives rise to a new classification algorithm, called Random Credal Random Forest (RCRF). The new method represents several improvements with respect to the classic RF: the use of a more successful split criterion which is more robust to noise than the classic ones; and an increasing of the randomness which facilitates the diversity of the rules obtained. In an experimental study, it is shown that this new algorithm is a clear enhancement of RF, especially when it applied on data sets with class noise, where the standard RF has a notable deterioration. The problem of overfitting that appears when RF classifies data sets with class noise is solved with RCRF. This new algorithm can be considered as a powerful alternative to be used on data with or without class noise. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Studies on emotion perception often require stimuli that convey different emotions. These stimuli can serve as a tool to understand how agents react to different circumstances. Although different stimuli have been commonly used to change the emotions of an agent, it is not clear how to measure the emotional state of an agent.
   This paper suggests a new method for measuring the emotional state among interacting agents in a given environment. We present the modeling of an adaptive emotional framework that takes into account agent emotion, interaction and learning process. For solving the problem, we employ a non-cooperative game theory approach for representing the interaction between agents and a Reinforcement Learning (RL) process for introducing the stimuli to the environment. We restrict our problem to a class of finite and homogeneous Markov games. The emotional problem is ergodic: each emotion can be represented by a state in a Markov chain which has a probability to be reached. Each emotional strategy of the Markov model is represented as a probability distribution. Then, for measuring the emotional state among agents, we employ the Kullback-Leibler distance between the resulting emotional strategies of the interacting agents. It is a distribution-wise asymmetric measure, then the feelings of one player for another are relative (different). We propose an algorithm for the RL process and for solving the game is proposed a two-step approach. We present an application example related to the selection process of a candidate for a specific position using assessment centers to show the effectiveness of the proposed method by a) measuring the emotional distance among the interacting agents and b) measuring the "emotional closeness degree" of the interacting agents to an ideal proposed candidate agent.

ID KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATION
AB Time fuzzy Petri nets (TFPNs) have been widely used to describe the transfer correlations among industrial process variables. However, the assignments of parameters associated with traditional TFPNs mostly rely on human expert knowledge. Additionally, traditional TFPNs have limited abilities to deal with dynamic time delays between correlated variables. In response to these problems, a dynamic timed fuzzy Petri nets (DTFPNs) modeling approach based on the dynamic time delay analysis (e-DTA) is proposed. Firstly, the basic structure of Petri nets is determined by taking advantage of process knowledge. Subsequently, as an improvement, a colored graph describing dynamic time delays between correlated variables is created using data mining techniques. A reachability analysis with temporal constraints is accordingly performed to track the system evolution dynamically. The proposed method is applied to a numerical case and a distillation column simulation, verifying the effectiveness of the contribution. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Location planning of electrical substations is a power planning problem, in which expert knowledge is used to determine ideal substation locations. Using intelligent planning to help electric power experts to reasonably plan the location of a substation can not only ensure the reliability of power supply, but also save on cost to a great extent. In order to improve the economics of electric power planning, this study proposes a combined biogeography-based optimization with population competition algorithm (BBOPC) method. Competition strategy can enhance the search ability of the algorithm due to the dispersed populations involved. A comparative evaluation against the biogeography-based optimization (BBO), competitive strategy based on BBO (CBBO), modified mutation operator based on BBO (MBBO), and BBOPC methods is carried out in selecting the optimal position for a substation. The final results show that, (1) for a simple substation location problem, the minimum total investment cost achieved by BBOPC was less than that of CBBO, currently the most cost-effective method whose total investment cost is relatively better. (2) For a complex substation location problem, the minimum total investment cost achieved by BBOPC was less than that of MBBO. (3) BBOPC demonstrates better convergence characteristics and robustness compared to the other approaches. The proposed BBOPC method can help power experts develop reasonable power planning, which can help the power system effectively achieve operational reliability and economy. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this paper, we present a multibiometric system based on two different biometric modalities, palmprint and fingerprint. The proposed system is based on a score fusion which can effectively combine the discriminative power of multiple biometric traits. We propose a combined fingerprint image enhancement, which achieves satisfactory results. We also apply two different indexing algorithms on fingerprints and three different indexing algorithms on palmprints. Existing multibiometric systems are not sufficiently fast for practical applications. Indexing and retrieval mechanisms can effectively narrow down the search space in large databases. We propose a fingerprint indexing based on ellipse properties, which reduces false correspondences. The proposal uses a k-means clustering algorithm to index and retrieve fingerprints and palmprints. Furthermore, we combine some minutia cylinder-code (MCC)-based algorithms and improve the MCC -based indexing algorithms. Empirical experiments on some of datasets of the national institute of standards and technology (NIST), fingerprint verification competition (FVC), and THU-PALMLAB databases show that the proposed algorithm considerably narrows down the search space in fingerprint and palmprint databases and increase the recognition performance.

AB Emergency event prediction is a crucial topic since the events could involve human injuries or even deaths. Many countries record a considerable number of emergency events (EVs) that are caused by a variety of incidents such as murder and robbery. Emergency response systems based on more accurate EV prediction can help to allocate the required resources and resolve the emergencies through more rapid and effective risk management. Most real-time EV prediction systems are based on traditional time series analysis techniques such as moving average or autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models. To improve the accuracy of EV prediction, we propose a new architecture for EV prediction based on recurrent neural networks (RNN), specifically a long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture. A comparative analysis is presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed architecture compared to traditional time series analysis and machine learning methods through the evaluation of historical EV data provided by the national police of Guatemala.

AB This article has proposed an intelligent knowledge driven method to segment hemorrhage from brain CT images using the information of pixel intensity population and distribution. A mathematical model is designed to identify the unexpected variation in pixel intensity population in a brain CT image having hemorrhage. Complete batch of multi-slice CT scan images is taken as input. Fusion of knowledge of brain anatomy with intensity distribution information of CT brain image results in a unique solution for hemorrhage segmentation. To test the robustness, segmentation of different types of hemorrhage of different patients is done using the proposed method. The results are accepted and validated by radiology experts. A fully automatic and fast Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) is designed, using the proposed method, to segment hemorrhage automatically, in the absence of an expert, for further inspections like checking severity, volume, size, shape and type of hemorrhage. Competence of the CAD is tested against mostly used established clustering methods to demonstrate its potential. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The presence of high spectral correlation in hyperspectral images has demanded dimensionality reduction. Selection of bands based on supervised techniques has been already developed for dimensionality reduction. In this manuscript, the selection of an optimal set of bands is formulated as an unsupervised problem. The images are initially compressed using discrete wavelet transform (DWT). Then, the details of the image are extracted in the transform domain using entropy which accounts for spatial information content and first spectral derivative (FSD) that exploits the temporal redundancy. These details are optimized using meta-heuristic algorithms to obtain the final set of bands. A new Binary Social Spider Optimization algorithm (BSSO) is proposed which maintains the exploration-exploitation balance and avoids premature convergence of solutions. The performance of BSSO is compared with other benchmark algorithms: Clonal algorithm (BCLONAL), Time-varying transfer function Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (TV-BPSO), Binary Genetic Algorithm (BGA), Improved Gravitational Search Algorithm (IBGSA) and New Binary Bat Algorithm (NBBA). A simulation study is carried on four standard hyperspectral images. The proposed BSSO have provided with 83% of overall accuracy for 24% bands in Salinas image set, 75% for 33% in Pavia University, 75% against 26% for Pavia Center and finally 91% in KSC with 32% bands retention. The achievement of higher accuracy at less than 50% bands is appreciable. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID GAUSSIAN MIXTURE; FUZZY; ALGORITHM
AB Semi-supervised clustering generally assumes that prior knowledge is helpful to improve clustering performance. However, the prior knowledge may degenerate the clustering performance if one collects wrong information, such as wrong labels. Hence, it is meaningful to design a safe semi-supervised clustering method which never performs worse than the corresponding unsupervised and semi-supervised clustering methods. In this paper, we develop local homogeneous consistent safe semi-supervised clustering where class labels are given as the prior knowledge. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time safe semi-supervised clustering has been studied. The basic idea is that the predictions of a labeled sample and its nearest homogeneous unlabeled ones should be similar when the labeled one is risky. In our algorithm, we firstly build a local graph to model the relationship between the labeled sample and its nearest homogeneous unlabeled ones through the results obtained by unsupervised clustering. A graph based regularization term is then constructed to allow the predictions of the labeled samples to approach that of the local homogeneous neighbors. It is expected to reduce the risk of the labeled samples. Meanwhile, our algorithm positively exploits the labeled samples by restricting the corresponding outputs to be the given class labels when the labeled ones may be helpful. In this sense, the predictions of the labeled samples in our algorithm are a tradeoff between the given class labels and the predictions of local homogeneous neighbors. To verify the effectiveness of our algorithm, we conduct a series of experiments on several UCI datasets. The results show that our algorithm outperforms the corresponding unsupervised and semi-supervised clustering methods even if the wrongly labeled ratio reaches 30%. In this sense, the proposed algorithm will not only enrich the theoretical knowledge in the machine learning field, but significantly improve the practicability of semi-supervised clustering in the expert and intelligent systems.

TI Interpretable regression trees using conformal prediction
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS

DT Article
DE Conformal prediction; Interpretability; Predictive regression;
   Regression trees
ID ALGORITHMS
AB A key property of conformal predictors is that they are valid, i.e., their error rate on novel data is bounded by a preset level of confidence. For regression, this is achieved by turning the point predictions of the underlying model into prediction intervals. Thus, the most important performance metric for evaluating conformal regressors is not the error rate, but the size of the prediction intervals, where models generating smaller (more informative) intervals are said to be more efficient. State-of-the-art conformal regressors typically utilize two separate predictive models: the underlying model providing the center point of each prediction interval, and a normalization model used to scale each prediction interval according to the estimated level of difficulty for each test instance. When using a regression tree as the underlying model, this approach may cause test instances falling into a specific leaf to receive different prediction intervals. This clearly deteriorates the interpretability of a conformal regression tree compared to a standard regression tree, since the path from the root to a leaf can no longer be translated into a rule explaining all predictions in that leaf. In fact, the model cannot even be interpreted on its own, i.e., without reference to the corresponding normalization model. Current practice effectively presents two options for constructing conformal regression trees: to employ a (global) normalization model, and thereby sacrifice interpretability; or to avoid normalization, and thereby sacrifice both efficiency and individualized predictions. In this paper, two additional approaches are considered, both employing local normalization: the first approach estimates the difficulty by the standard deviation of the target values in each leaf, while the second approach employs Mondrian conformal prediction, which results in regression trees where each rule (path from root node to leaf node) is independently valid. An empirical evaluation shows that the first approach is as efficient as current state-of-the-art approaches, thus eliminating the efficiency vs. interpretability trade-off present in existing methods. Moreover, it is shown that if a validity guarantee is required for each single rule, as provided by the Mondrian approach, a penalty with respect to efficiency has to be paid, but it is only substantial at very high confidence levels.

ID ACCURATE
AB Code obfuscation is a staple tool in malware creation where code fragments are altered substantially to make them appear different from the original, while keeping the semantics unaffected. A majority of the obfuscated code detection methods use program structure as a signature for detection of unknown codes. They usually ignore the most important feature, which is the semantics of the code, to match two code fragments or programs for obfuscation. Obfuscated code detection is a special case of the semantic code clone detection task. We propose a detection framework for detecting both code obfuscation and clone using machine learning. We use features extracted from Java bytecode dependency graphs (BDG), program dependency graphs (PDG) and abstract syntax trees (AST). BDGs and PDGs are two representations of the semantics or meaning of a Java program. ASTs capture the structural aspects of a program. We use several publicly available code clone and obfuscated code datasets to validate the effectiveness of our framework. We use different assessment parameters to evaluate the detection quality of our proposed model. Experimental results are excellent when compared with contemporary obfuscated code and code clone detectors. Interestingly, we achieve 100% success in detecting obfuscated code based on recall, precision, and F1-Score. When we compare our method with other methods for all of obfuscations types, viz, contraction, expansion, loop transformation and renaming, our model appears to be the winner. In case of clone detection our model achieve very high detection accuracy in comparison to other similar detectors. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB An online handwriting recognition (HR) system is usually developed considering point-based features that describe different geometric attributes of handwriting. Often, due to the wide variations in writing styles, the use of point-based features results in high intro-class variability in feature space. To address this problem, we propose a set of features based on character class-conditional probabilities (posterior features) derived from Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for online HR task. The proposed features capture class dependent characteristics with a probabilistic framework, which in turn aid in minimizing the intra-class variability of the feature space. Also, the features well represent the inter-class variability of the feature space for a given classification task. The efficacy of the proposed GMM posterior features is shown for character and word recognition tasks, employing support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The experiments are conducted on three databases: the locally collected Assamese digit database, the UNIPEN English character database, and the UNIPEN ICROW-03 English word database. Recognition results are promising over the reported works employing point-based features. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Orange juice (OJ) and malt extract (ME) samples were treated using an electrokinetic (EK) application to investigate the impact of the pH/Lowest conductivity point (LCP) ratio of experimental materials on the water profile direction and the anolyte to catholyte filtrate ratio. After applying the electric field through samples between two electrodes, filtrate was discharged mainly towards the anode in OJ samples (acidic medium, pH/LCP < 1) and towards the cathode in ME samples (alkaline medium, pH/LCP > 1). Adjusting the orientation of electrodes depending on the results maximised dewatering efficiency under EK by 7.8% in OJ and 11.8% in ME. Changing the pH/LCP ratio by adjusting the starting pH improved dewatering efficiency under EK by 25.7%. The results are used to develop theoretical guidelines to help determine the water profile direction and filtrate outlets for different food materials based on their pH and LCP values. EK is an effective method for dewatering food materials.

AB This study focuses on two fractions from sea buckthorn (Elaeagnus rhamnoides (L.) A. Nelson) fruits: the phenolic fraction (rich in non-acylated and acylated flavonoids and non-polar compounds) and the non-polar fraction. The objective was to investigate both the chemical composition of these fractions, as well as their biological activities in vitro. The tested fractions of sea buckthorn inhibited lipid peroxidation induced by H2O2, however, the non-polar fraction reduced more powerfully the process induced by H2O2/Fe as compared to the phenolic fraction. The tested fractions of sea buckthorn fruits also inhibited carbonylation stimulated by H2O2/Fe. Moreover, the action of the phenolic fraction and non-polar fraction on hemostatic parameters of plasma was also compared to activities of other phenolic fraction, in which flavonoids were the dominant compounds. Our results indicate that sea buckthorn fruits are a rich source of different secondary metabolites, i.e. triterpenes and their derivates, which possess not only antioxidant properties, but may also display anticoagulant attributes.

AB Evaluation of phenolic contents and their in vitro bioactivities of six diverse cultivars of foxtail and little millets revealed that their total phenolic content ranged from 19.42 to 24.12 mu mol ferulic acid equivalents/g. The soluble fraction accounted for more than 80% of the total phenolic and flavonoid contents. Ferulic, caffeic and sinapic acids were the predominant phenolic acids, and luteolin and kaempferol were major flavonoids in the soluble fractions of millets. However, ferulic and p-coumaric acids were abundant in the bound fractions. Millet cultivars exhibited relevant changes in antioxidant activities in different mechanisms. Little millet cultivars showed superior inhibition of alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase than foxtail millet cultivars. The soluble and bound fractions of CO7 cultivar of foxtail millet (IC50, 22.37 and 57.26 mu g/ml) and CO4 cultivar of little millet (IC50, 18.97 and 55.69 mu g/ml) displayed strong inhibition towards alpha-glucosidase. These results suggest the potential application of underutilized millets as functional food ingredients for regulating postprandial hyperglycemia.

AB Razor clam is a major cultivated shellfish of great economic importance and high nutritional value. Due to high corruptible potential, razor clam is generally preserved by controlled freezing-point storage (CFPS). Here, we applied isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) labeling to investigate the biochemical mechanism of cold stress adaption in razor clam during CFPS. In total, 369 proteins were quantified, and 27 of them were identified as differentially expressed proteins during CFPS, mostly involved in energy metabolism process, DNA duplication and protein synthesis, and stress response, specifically, MAPK is the predominant pathway. Further qPCR results revealed H2A and S6K 2 alpha to be the critical post-transcriptionally regulated genes. Our results provided proteomics information with respect to the biochemical mechanism of cold stress adaption in razor clam, shed light on the further elongation of razor clams storage period, and help clarify the novel mechanisms of cold tolerance.

AB It has been reported that an increased function of the P2X(7) purinergic receptor is associated with an increase in both insulin sensitivity and secretion. Accordingly, we explored the possible effect of the 1068 G > A polymorphism of the gene P2RX7 on glucose homeostasis and the levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-1Ra in T2D patients. The presence of the 1068 G > A polymorphism in T2D patients (n = 100) and healthy subjects (n = 100) was determined by DNA sequencing, and serum levels of IL-1Ra were measured by ELISA. Pancreatic beta-cell function, insulin resistance, blood glucose levels and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) were also analyzed. We detected a significant negative association between T2D and the 1068 G > A SNP (Odds ratio 0.3916, p = 0.0045). In addition, we observed that T2D patients bearing the 1068 G > A variant showed higher serum levels of IL-1Ra compared to both, patients with the GG genotype or healthy individuals (GG or G > A). Moreover, T2D patients bearing the 1068 G > A SNP showed increased insulin levels and a better pancreatic beta-cell function (p < 0.05 in both cases) compared to patients with the wild type genotype. However, the HbA1c levels, fasting glucose levels and the degree of insulin resistance were similar in T2D patients carrying or not the G > A SNP. Our results suggest that although the 1068 G > A polymorphism of the P2RX7 gene is associated with an increased beta-cell function and IL-1Ra release in T2D patients, the glycemic control is not significantly affected by the presence of this SNP.

AB The mitochondrial genomes of sea anemones are dynamic in structure. Invasion by genetic elements, such as self-catalytic group I introns or insertion-like sequences, contribute to sea anemone mitochondria] genome expansion and complexity. By using next generation sequencing we investigated the complete mtDNAs and corresponding transcriptomes of the temperate sea anemone Anemonia viridis and its closer tropical relative Anemonia majano. Two versions of fused homing endonuclease gene (HEG) organization were observed among the Actiniidae sea anemones; in-frame gene fusion and pseudo-gene fusion. We provided support for the pseudo gene fusion organization in Anemonia species, resulting in a repressed HEG from the COI-884 group I intron. orfA, a putative protein-coding gene with insertion-like features, was present in both Anemonia species. Interestingly, orfA and COI expression were significantly up-regulated upon long-term environmental stress corresponding to low seawater pH conditions. This study provides new insights to the dynamics of sea anemone mitochondria] genome structure and function.

AB In adult cattle Fasciola hepatica infection usually follows a chronic subclinical course, and reduces both the milk yield and milk quality, resulting in considerable financial losses. Effective control of the disease is based on reliable identification of asymptomatically infected individuals, which now requires special parasitological or serological diagnostic tests. It is also known that F. hepatica infection induces alterations in some serum biochemical parameters. Therefore, the study was conducted to develop a model based on serum biochemical parameters allowing to identify cows at higher risk of chronic fascioliasis. Six hundred sixty eight adult dairy cows from 97 herds located in central and northeastern Poland were clinically examined, and blood and fecal samples from them were collected for a routine monitoring of fascioliasis and metabolic profile. Using the combination of fecal sedimentation test and indirect ELISA based on excretory/secretory products 203 cows, apparently healthy in clinical examination, were definitively classed as affected by (47 cows, 23.2%) or free from (156 cows, 76.8%) chronic fascioliasis. Their serum was screened for the activity of 4 enzymes (gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, glutamate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase, creatine kinase) and concentration of 18 other components (total bilirubin, total protein, albumin, globulin, urea, glucose, non-esterified fatty acids, (beta-hydroxybutyrate, sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, magnesium, copper, zinc, iron, selenium, and haptoglobin). Logistic regression analysis was used to build 4 multivariable models allowing for identification of cows at risk of chronic fascioliasis. Then, the accuracy was compared between the models using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), and an optimal cut-off value was determined for the most accurate model using Youden J index. The most accurate proved to be the model based on glutamate dehydrogenase activity and globulin, urea (all three positively linked with risk of chronic fascioliasis), and selenium concentration (negatively linked) adjusted by the access to pasture and cow's age. At the optimal cut-off of 0.37 this model had sensitivity of 85.1% (CI 95%:72.3%, 92.6%), specificity of 90.4% (CI 95%:84.7%, 94.1%), positive likelihood ratio of 8.8 (CI 95%:5.4, 14.5), and negative likelihood ratio of 0.16 (CI 95%:0.08, 0.33). This model performed significantly better than model including only gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase or model including both y-glutamyl transpeptidase and aspartate aminotransferase (both also adjusted by the access to pasture and cow's age), and was the only model which performed significantly better than the basic model based solely on the access to pasture and cow's age.

AB All Theileria parasites have definitive natural hosts that act as carriers. Incidental infections of uncommon hosts do occur raising questions regarding host specificity and its drivers. Reported hosts for Theileria taurotragi include bushbuck, cattle and eland. More recently T. taurotragi was detected in African buffalo, which may have implications for accurate diagnostics of T. parva. The current study therefore investigated the host specificity of T. taurotragi by developing a specific and sensitive real-time Taqman PCR assay. Animals were screened from areas where Rhipicephalus appendiculatus, the tick vector for both T. parva and T. taurotragi was present. While T. taurotragi was detected in cattle, eland, kudu and nyala, African buffalo (n = 352) was negative. Conversely, these same buffalo showed a prevalence of 72-100% for T. parva. While transmission of T. taurotragi to cattle was successful using the same infected tick batch, transmission to African buffalo did not occur. The results suggest that African buffalo is not a natural host of T. taurotragi and would probably not harbor anti-schizont antibodies against T. taurotragi. This would preclude T. taurotragi as possible source of cross-reactivity in the T. parva immunofluorescent antibody test. Host specificity of T. taurotragi for members of the Tragelaphini, but not buffalo also suggests that host specificity may have been an important driver in the speciation of the T. taurotragi Glade.

AB Sheep production in tropical and temperate regions is hampered by the presence of Haemonchus contortus, the blood-sucking nematode that is the major cause of economic losses in small ruminant enterprises. The most limiting factor in the control of this parasitic disease is the steady progress of anthelmintic resistance worldwide. The search for control strategies that minimise the use of anthelmintics is therefore central to various efforts worldwide. One strategy is the introduction of susceptible parasites in refugia when these refugia are at low levels. This strategy could lead to a renewed possibility anthelmintics being effective. At farm level, this management practice could recover the use of anthelmintics in flocks with high levels of resistance. This review explores the possibility of replacing resistant H. contortus populations with susceptible ones through refugia management and. highlights the experiences of on-farm research attempts carried out in different geographical areas, reaching various degrees of success.

AB Culicoides biting midges (Diptera:Ceratopogonidae) cause a significant biting nuisance to humans, livestock, which are the biological vectors of a range of risky pathogens. Accurate illustration of vector play a key role in arthropod borne diseases surveillance. However, few studies have focused on the Culicoides, which caused bluetongue disease in 29 provinces of China since 1979.
   In this study, we assessed cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) mtDNA molecular marker for identification of ten major vector species and analyzed the Culicoides species community and diversity in different habitats. A total of 20,795 Culicoides samples collected from 11 sample sites were identified as 23 species belonging to 7 subgenera. Sequences of COI gene worked well as barcodes for identifying all the determined specimen in this study and were comparable with the existing sequence data from GenBank. We first reported COI barcode sequences of C. morisitai, C. insignipennis and C. homotomus. Morphological identification of Culicoides spp. samples within southern China appears relatively robust and some unidentified species were required further study. Our study shows that the COI sequence data can be used as a tool to identify species of Culicoides in Jiangxi Province.
   In our sampled area, the most abundant species was C. arakawae (61.89%), followed by C. oxystoma (13.77%), C. punctatus (10.10%), C. nipponensis (8.82%), C. homotomus (3.19%) and C.morisitai (1.17%) in this study. C. punctatus was the dominant species of Park habitat (62.22%), C. arakawae was the predominant species of Chicken habitat (96.66%), Vegetable plot habitat (92.0%), and Peasant household habitat (83.21%), respectively. C. oxystoma was the abundant species of Residential area habitat (40.11%), Hospital habitat (56.65%), and Pig & Cow habitat (48.77%), respectively. Results also show that the potential Bluetongue virus vectors belong to the Obsoletus and Pulicaris groups, are also included and relatively abundant, notably: Culicoides punctatus. These findings expand the current knowledge of Culicoides population composition in the southern part of China.

AB Canine babesiosis is a tick-borne disease caused by several Babesia spp. which have different susceptebility to anti-protozoal drugs. A few drugs and drug combinations are used in the treatment of canine babesiosis often without complete parasite elimination leaving treated dogs as carriers which could relapse with clinical disease and also transmit infection further. Although the large form canine babesial species Babesia canis, Babesia vogeli and Babesia rossi are sensitive to the aromatic diamidines imidocarb dipropionate and diminazene aceturate, small form species such as Babesia gibsoni, Babesia conradae and Babesia vulpes (Theileria annae) are relatively resistant to these drugs and are treated with the combination of the hydroxynaphthoquinone atovaquone and the antibiotic azithromycin. Azithromycin and other antibiotics that have anti-protozoal properties target the apicoplast, a relict plastid found in protozoa, and exert a delayed death effect. The triple combination of dindamycin, diminazene aceturate and imidocarb dipropionate is also effective against B. gibsoni and used to treat atovaquone-resistant strains of this species. Novel drugs and the synergistic effects of drug combinations against Babesia infection should be explored further to find new treatments for canine babesiosis.

AB The raccoon (Procyon lotor) is a North American carnivore introduced to Europe in the 20th Century. Raccoons are believed to be the potential hosts of many parasites, or to be involved in their transmission to other animals. Nematodes of the genus Trichinella can infect many carnivorous and omnivorous animals worldwide. The aim of the present study was to determine the occurrence of Trichinella spp. infection in raccoons in Central Europe. Muscle samples were collected from various regions of Poland, the Czech Republic and Germany during the years 2012-2016. The larvae of Trichinella spp. were detected in 11 raccoons, and these were identified as T. spiralis and T. pseudospiralis by multiplex PCR (89.9% and 9.1%, respectively). No mixed infection was observed. This is the first report describing the occurrence of T. spiralis and T. pseudospiralis in P. lotor in Central Europe. Our findings also show that the raccoon population acts as a reservoir of Trichinella pseudospiralis.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible changes in the concentration of anti-Leishmania antibodies in saliva samples from dogs with clinical leishmaniosis after short-term treatment. Twenty dogs with clinical signs and laboratory abnormalities compatible with canine leishmaniosis (CanL) were diagnosed and treated with a standard antimonial plus allopurinol therapy. The concentration of anti-Leishmania IgG2 and IgA antibodies in saliva was measured at the time of diagnosis (day 0) and after treatment (day 30) by time-resolved immuno-fluorometric assays (TR-IFMAs) and results were compared with those of serum. In addition, correlations between antibody concentrations in saliva and serum, clinical scores and selected laboratory analytes were calculated. TR-IFMA results were expressed as Units of Fluorometry for Leishmania (UFL). Most dogs that adequately responded to treatment (n = 17) showed a reduction of anti-Leishmania antibodies in saliva [median IgG2: from 678.0 (day 0) to 201.1 UFL (day 30), p < 0.0001; median IgA: from 91.3 (day 0) to 60.2 UFL (day 30), p < 0.01] in accordance with clinical improvement (p < 0.0001). However, two of these dogs showed an increase of anti-Leishmania antibodies in saliva. Among dogs that did not improve after one month of treatment (n = 3), two showed a reduction in serum and saliva antibodies. In these two dogs, clinical recovery was achieved after one additional month of treatment with allopurinol. The other dog that did not respond to treatment showed increases in the concentration of anti-Leishmania antibodies, both in saliva and serum, and did not adequately respond to an additional month of treatment with allopurinol. From this pilot study, it could be concluded that, despite the low number of dogs used, the measurement of anti-Leishmania IgG2 and IgA antibodies in saliva could have a potential use for treatment monitoring of CanL, provided that a sufficient amount of specific antibodies is present at diagnosis. This is because, especially in the case of IgG2, there is a high correlation between the saliva and serum concentrations, and the reduction of antibodies is generally in accordance with the clinical improvement. Further long-term studies with a larger population should be undertaken to confirm this potential.

AB A Bayesian model was developed to estimate values for the prevalence and diagnostic test characteristics of bovine cysticercosis (Taenia saginata) by combining results of four imperfect tests. Samples of 612 bovine carcases that were found negative for cysticercosis during routine meat inspection collected at three Belgian slaughterhouses, underwent enhanced meat inspection (additional incisions in the heart), dissection of the predilection sites, B158/B60 Ag-ELISA and ES Ab-ELISA. This Bayesian approach allows for the combination of prior expert opinion with experimental data to estimate the true prevalence of bovine cysticercosis in the absence of a gold standard test. A first model (based on a multinomial distribution and including all possible interactions between the individual tests) required estimation of 31 parameters, while only allowing for 15 parameters to be estimated. Including prior expert information about specificity and sensitivity resulted in an optimal model with a reduction of the number of parameters to be estimated to 8. The estimated bovine cysticercosis prevalence was 33.9% (95% credibility interval: 27.7-44.4%), while apparent prevalence based on meat inspection is only 0.23%. The test performances were estimated as follows (sensitivity (Se) specificity (Sp)): enhanced meat inspection (Se 2.87% - Sp 100%), dissection of predilection sites (Se 69.8% - Sp 100%), Ag-ELISA (Se 26.9% - Sp 99.4%), Ab-ELISA (Se 13.8% - Sp 92.9%).

Eimeria tenella (E. tenella) has the ability to circumvent apoptosis of infected cells through increased expression of the transcriptional factor NF-kappa B and the anti-apoptotic factor Bc1-x(L) during the development of second generation schizonts. Artemisinin (ART) and its original plant, the dried leaves of Artemisia annua (LAA) have been shown to be effective against avian coccidiosis, however, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. We showed that E. tenella infection promoted the expression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and inhibited the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and cleaved caspase-3 at 60 h post infection (PI), with a higher ratio of Bcl-2 to Bax. Nevertheless, the expression trends of Bcl-2, Bax and caspase-3 were reversed at 120 h and 192 h PI. ART treatment significantly abrogated Bcl-2 expression, whereas it promoted the expression levels of Bax and cleaved caspase-3 at the three time points above. Additionally, ART remarkably suppressed the increased mRNA expressions of NF-kappa B and interleukin-17A in ceca during infection by E. tenella. Compared with the ART treatment, LAA treatment exerted more improvements in clinical symptoms, promoting apoptosis and suppressing inflammatory response. These alterations caused by ART and LAA treatments were consistent with the reduced clinical diarrhea and pathological improvements in chicken ceca. Collectively, these results indicate that the inhibitory effects of ART or LAA on E. tenella infection may work through facilitating the apoptosis of infected host cells and inhibiting the inflammatory response.

AB Application of molecular approaches has led to a significant progress on the knowledge of the epidemiology of Cryptosporidium spp. Nevertheless, molecular information on the occurrence of cryptosporidiosis in domestic small ruminants, especially in goats, are limited and restricted to the study of a modest number of isolates, mainly from diarrhoeic neonates. In order to determine the Cryptosporidium species present in healthy post weaned and adult small ruminants from north-western Spain and to analyse a possible age-related distribution of species, faecal specimens were collected in sheep and goat farms without neonatal diarrhoea outbreaks the year before the sampling. Cryptosporidium spp. DNA was detected by SSU-rRNA PCR-RFLP, using restriction enzymes Sspl, Vspl and Mboll. C. parvum and C. ubiquitum isolates were further characterized at the GP60 locus.
   Our results reveal that Cryptosporidium spp. is widely distributed in small ruminant farms (47.4-50.0%), although its prevalence is low in both hosts (5.9-6.0%). No significant differences in individual prevalence were detected between age groups. C. xiaoi and the zoonotic C. parvum and C. ubiquitum were identified. In sheep, C. parvum was the predominant species and its prevalence increased with age, in contrast to C. xiaoi; C. ubiquitum was an occasional finding in adults. In goats, C. xiaoi and C. ubiquitum were the most frequent species and slightly more prevalent in adults than in post-weaned kids, in contrast to C. parvum. Subtyping analysis of C. parvum isolates revealed the presence of IlaA15G2R1 and IlaA14G2R1 in sheep, whereas IlaA13G1R1 and IIdA17G1 were restricted to goats; only the C. ubiquitum XIIa subtype 3 was found.
   Although the prevalences detected are low, these values are probably underestimated due to, amongst others, the cross-sectional design of the study and the intermittent oocyst-excretion of post-weaned and adult small ruminants. Thus, these animals may play an important role in the appearance of cryptosporidiosis outbreaks in humans and domestic ruminant neonates and therefore should be considered as a potential threat to animal production and human health.

AB Haemonchus contortus is the most prevalent nematode in tropical and subtropical regions and is responsible for significant losses in small ruminant production systems. Control of this parasite is based on the use of synthetic anthelmintics; although effective, prolonged and indiscriminate use can select for populations of resistant nematodes. Hydrolyzed yeast can help prevent populations of nematodes and is low in cost. The present study aimed to evaluate the preventive effect of hydrolyzed yeast on H. contortus through in vitro and in vivo assays. In in vitro experiments, the yeast preparation was tested at different stages of the H. contortus life cycle via tests of egg hatchability, larval development, larval exsheathment and larval migration. Both eggs and L3 larvae were obtained from sheep artificially infected with a monospecific strain of H. contortus. In in vivo experiments, animals were treated with hydrolyzed yeast (53.4 mg/kg/BW), and fecal egg counts (FECs), feces culture and Famacha were performed. The yeast preparation inhibited larval exsheathment in a dose -dependent manner (IC95 of 0.46 mg/mL), though no activity at the other stages of the H. contortus life cycle was observed. The hydrolyzed yeast preparation was able to reduce FECs in treated animals from D40 to D54 (p < 0.05), showing an average efficiency of 60%. The yeast exhibited preventive properties, and the IC95 value suggests that H. contortus is highly susceptible. Our results indicate that administration of hydrolyzed yeast, which is already used commercially in ruminant nutrition, is an alternative method for the control of nematodes, mainly H. contortus.

AB Anthelmintic resistance (AR) is a serious threat to animal health and has a major economic impact worldwide due to production and financial losses. The aim of this study was to determine the occurrence of AR on 30 goat farms in Slovakia during the pasturing seasons and to compare three widely used in vitro and in vivo methods for detecting AR in field conditions. A three-year survey was conducted during the pasturing seasons of 2014-2016. Goats on each farm were split into treated and control groups and were treated by recommended (5 mg/kg body weight) and double doses (10 mg/kg b.w.) of albendazole. Comparisons between percent reduction in a faecal egg count reduction test (FECRT) and an egg hatch test (EHT) and the presence of L-3 larvae in a larval development test (LDT) using resistant concentrations of benzimidazole (BZ) were monitored after treatment. The FECRT indicated percent reductions of 69.2-86.2% for the single dose and of 36.3-45.4% for the double dose. The EHT indicated that all farms had BZ-resistant nematodes. Low (< 15% hatching) and high (> 15% hatching) levels of resistance were detected on 13 and 17 farms, respectively. The LDT failed to detect resistant larvae on seven farms but detected low and high levels of resistance on seven and 14 farms, respectively. The data indicate a moderate correlation between in vitro and in vivo tests for detecting BZ resistance among the 30 goat farms. The hatching detected by the EHT and the presence of L3 larvae by the LDT at resistant BZ concentrations provided reasonable identification of low levels of resistance in the parasite populations, but the use of a double dose for a treatment may underestimate the real occurrence of low levels of resistant parasites on goat farms.

AB Monitoring Eimeria shedding has become more important due to the recent restrictions to the use of antibiotics within the poultry industry. Therefore, there is a need for the implementation of more precise and accurate quantitative diagnostic techniques. The objective of this study was to compare the precision and accuracy between the Mini-FLOTAC and the McMaster techniques for quantitative diagnosis of Eimeria maxima oocyst in poultry. Twelve pools of excreta samples of broiler chickens experimentally infected with E. maxima were analyzed for the comparison between Mini-FLOTAC and McMaster technique using, the detection limits (dl) of 23 and 25, respectively. Additionally, six excreta samples were used to compare the precision of different dl (5, 10, 23, and 46) using the Mini-FLOTAC technique. For precision comparisons, five technical replicates of each sample (five replicate slides on one excreta slurry) were read for calculating the mean oocyst per gram of excreta (OPG) count, standard deviation (SD), coefficient of variation (CV), and precision of both aforementioned comparisons. To compare accuracy between the methods (McMaster, and Mini-FLOTAC dl 5 and 23), excreta from uninfected chickens was spiked with 100, 500, 1,000, 5,000, or 10,000 OPG; additional samples remained unspiked (negative control). For each spiking level, three samples were read in triplicate, totaling nine reads per spiking level per technique. Data were transformed using log10 to obtain normality and homogeneity of variances. A significant correlation (R = 0.74; p = 0.006) was observed between the mean OPG of the McMaster dl 25 and the Mini-FLOTAC dl 23. Mean OPG, CV, SD, and precision were not statistically different between the McMaster dl 25 and Mini-FLOTAC dl 23. Despite the absence of statistical difference (p > 0.05), Mini-FLOTAC dl 5 showed a numerically lower SD and CV than Mini-FLOTAC dl 23. The Pearson correlation coefficient revealed significant and positive correlation among the four dl (p <= 0.05). In the accuracy study, it was observed that the Mini-FLOTAC dl 5 and 23 were more accurate than the McMaster for 100 OPG, and the Mini-FLOTAC dl 23 had the highest accuracy for 500 OPG. The McMaster and Mini-FLOTAC dl 23 techniques were more accurate than the Mini-FLOTAC dl 5 for 5,000 OPG, and both dl of the Mini-FLOTAC were less accurate for 10,000 OPG counts than the McMaster technique. However, the overall accuracy of the Mini-FLOTAC dl 23 was higher than the McMaster and Mini-FLOTAC dl 5 techniques.

AB There are multiple vector-borne diseases in cats, the most prominent being those transmitted by mosquitos, sand flies, fleas, and ticks. Many of the agents vectored by fleas or ticks have been grown or amplified from blood or have induced antibodies in the serum of normal cats or those with clinical signs like fever and will be the focus of this manuscript. As high as 80% of fleas collected from cats contain at least one organism that could induce illness in cats or people. Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Bartonella spp., Borrelia spp., Ehrlichia spp., hemoplasmas, and Rickettsia spp. infect cats and can be associated with clinical illness. Anaplasma phagocytophilum and B. burgdorferi are transmitted by Ixodes spp., Ehrlichia spp. and A. platys are transmitted by Rhipicephalus sanguineus. Fleas vector Bartonella spp., hemoplasmas, and R. felis. Recently, R. typhus was detected in cats in Spain. Lethargy and fever are common findings in cats with flea and tick borne diseases. Hemoplasmas are associated with hemolytic anemia. Moderate thrombocytopenia is associated with the tick-vectored agents. Polymerase chain reaction assays performed on blood collected in the acute phase of infection can be used to prove presence of the organisms. Doxycycline at 5 mg/kg, PO, twice daily or 10 mg/kg, PO, daily can be effective for resolving the clinical signs. If doxycycline is ineffective or not tolerated, fluoroquinolones can be effective for treatment of clinical illness associated with Bartonella spp., hemoplasmas, and Rickettsia spp. Use of flea and tick control products is effective for blocking transmission of many of the agents.

AB Enolase (EC 4.2.1.11) acts as a multifunctional enzyme in many organisms, being involved in metabolism, transcription regulation and pathogenesis. In the current study, the recombinant a-enolase from Taenia solium (His-Tseno) was prepared and antiserum against His-Tseno was generated in rabbits. Consequently, we analyzed the enzymatic characteristics, plasminogen binding activity, tissue localization and expression patterns of Tseno. The study demonstrated that the enzymatic activity of His-Tseno was enhanced at pH around 7.0-7.5 and affected by addition of metal ions. Kinetic measurements using 2-phospho-D-glycerate (2-PGA) substrates gave a specific activity of 60.72 +/- 0.84 U/mg and 1.1 mM of Km(2-PGA) value. Plasminogen binding assay showed that His-Tseno could bind to human plasminogen and generate plasmin activated by a tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA). In addition, the lysine analogue 6-aminocaproic acid (epsilon-ACA) could inhibit the binding of plasminogen to His-Tseno. Quantitative real-time PCR confirmed that Tseno was expressed 2.38 folds higher in the adult worms (p < 0.05) than in the cysticerci. Further, an immunolocalization assay indicated that native Tseno was mainly distributed in the tegument and eggs of gravid proglottis from adult T. solium. In conclusion, Tseno executes the innate glycolytic function to supply energy for the growth, egg production, and even invasion of T. solium.

AB UK guidelines for the sustainable control of parasites in sheep (SCOPS) were formulated with the primary aim of delaying development of anthelmintic resistance (AR) on UK sheep farms. Promoting their use requires the engagement and commitment of stakeholders. An important driver for behavioural change in sheep farmers is evidence of economic benefits. A recent evaluation of SCOPS guidance in practice demonstrated a significant reduction in anthelmintic use, suggesting economic benefits through a direct reduction in product and labour costs. However, in order to maintain production, a range of alternative control strategies are advised, resulting in additional costs to farmers and so a full cost benefit analysis of best practice management was undertaken. We allocated financial values to the management recommendations described in the SCOPS technical manual. Benefits were calculated using data for production variables and anthelmintic use measured during studies to evaluate the effect of SCOPS recommendations on 16 UK sheep farms and from other published work. As SCOPS control is not prescriptive and a range of different diagnostics are available, best and worst case scenarios were presented, comparing the cheapest methods (e.g. egg counts without larval culture) and management situations (e.g closed flocks not requiring quarantine treatments) with the most laborious and expensive. Simulations were run for farms with a small, medium or large flock (300; 1000; 1900 ewes) as well as comparing scenarios with and without potential production benefits from using effective wormers. Analysis demonstrated a moderate cost for all farms under both scenarios when production benefits were not included. A cost benefit was demonstrated for medium and large farms when production benefits were included and the benefit could be perceived as significant in the case of the large farms for the best case scenario (> (sic)5000 per annum). Despite a significant potential reduction in anthelmintic use by farmers employing SCOPS guidance, the very low price of the older anthelmintic classes meant that the benefit did not always outweigh the additional management/diagnostic costs unless an increase in production was also achieved. This is an important finding. Focussing research on key innovations that will improve the cost effectiveness of diagnostic assays in a diagnostic driven control strategy, as well as designing treatment options that can improve production outcomes, and presenting them in a clear and transparent way, must be high priority goals. Coupling targeted research with improvements in the delivery of messages to the end user is important in the light of increasing global concerns over drug resistance.

AB In Australia, tick paralysis in dogs (caused by a toxin in the saliva of Ixodes species during feeding) is a serious, distressing condition, and untreated it is often fatal. The aim of this study was to quantify the association between parkland (recreational or natural) in an urban area and the occurrence of canine tick paralysis. Brisbane, as a large urban centre located within the zone of paralysis tick habitat along the east coast of Australia, was selected as the study area. Postcodes selected for inclusion were those defined as being of an urban character (Australian Bureau of Statistics). The number of natural and recreational parkland polygons and total land area per postcode were derived. Tick paralysis case data for the selected postcodes were extracted from a national companion animal disease surveillance database. Between October 2010 and January 2017, 1650 cases of tick paralysis in dogs were reported and included in this study. Significant correlations were found between the number of reported cases per postcode and parklands: natural counts, 0.584 (P < 0.0001); natural area, 0.293 (P = 0.0075); recreational counts, 0.297 (P = 0.0151); and recreational area, 0.241 (P = 0.0286). Four disease clusters were also detected within the study area. All of these were located on the edges of the study area either coastal or on the urban fringe; no clusters were identified within the core urban zone of the study area. Of the disease cases included in this study, strong seasonality was evidence: 68% of all cases were identified in spring. Within urban environments, areas of natural vegetation in particular appear to pose a risk for tick paralysis in dogs. This evidence can be used by veterinarians and dog owners to reduce the impact of tick paralysis by raising awareness of risk areas so as to enhance prevention via chemoprophylaxis and targeted searches of pet dogs for attached ticks.

AB Nasopharyngeal linguatuliasis known as Halzoun or Marrara syndrome occurs following ingestion of raw or undercooked viscera, including lymph nodes, liver and lung of infected animals. The present study was aimed to investigate the behavioral changes induced by ingestion of Linguatula serrata nymphs in rats. For this purpose, 24 rats were divided into four groups and orally ingested with 0 (control), 15, 30 and 60 L. serrata nymphs, respectively. Sneezing, mouth and tongue movements and mouth opening numbers were counted and the duration of mouth and nose grooming was measured at 10 -min blocks for 30 min. Ingestion of 0 (normal saline) number of nymph produced negligible behaviors, whereas 15, 30 and 60 numbers of nymphs increased the above mentioned behaviors when compared to normal saline (0 nymph) group. In this context, 60 number of nymphs produced more behavioral changes than 15 nymphs. We concluded that ingestion of L. serrata nymphs can produce behavioral changes in orofacial area in rats.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the immunogenic and immunoprotective activities and to determine the neuroprotective capacity of the tetravalent vaccine containing selected recombinant T. gondii antigens (ROP2 + ROP4 + SAG1 + MAG1) administered with safe adjuvants (MPL and alum) using male and female inbred mice. The tested antigenic combination provided partial protection against brain cyst formation, especially in males (reduction in cyst burden by 72%). The decrease in cyst burden was observed for the whole brain as well as for specified brain regions associated with natural defensive behaviors, emotion processing and integration of motor and sensory stimuli. The vaccine triggered a strong, specific immune response, regardless of sex, which was characterized by the antigen-specific in vitro synthesis of cytokines (IL-2, IFN-gamma and IL-10) and in vivo production of systemic IgG1 and IgG2a immunoglobulins. Immunization prior to the parasite challenge seemed to influence T. gondii - associated behavioral and neurochemical changes, although the impact of vaccination strongly depended on sex and time post-infection. Interestingly, in the vaccinated and T. gondii infected mice there was a significant delay in the parasite-induced loss of aversion toward cat smell (cats are the definitive hosts of the parasite). The regained attraction toward feline scent in vaccinated males, observed during chronic parasite invasion, correlated with the increase in the dopamine metabolism.

AB Melarsomine dihydrochloride (Immiticide, Merial) is the only approved adulticidal drug for the treatment of canine heartworm disease (HWD). However, in cases where arsenical therapy is not possible or is contraindicated, a monthly heartworm preventive along with doxycycline for a 4-week period, which targets the bacterial endosymbiont Wolbachia, might be considered. There are published reports on the efficacy of ivermectin and doxycycline in both experimentally and naturally infected dogs, but no data on the use of other macrocyclic lactones (MLs) with a similar treatment regime. Preliminary results of studies in dogs show that a topical formulation of moxidectin, the only ML currently registered as a microfilaricide, is also adulticidal when combined with doxycycline. It is not yet known if the efficacy of these combination therapies is due to pharmacokinetic synergism. A recent study showed that serum levels of doxycycline in dogs treated with the combination protocol were not statistically different compared to dogs treated with doxycycline alone. However, lungs from dogs treated with the combination therapy showed a marked reduction in T regulatory cells, indicating that treatment efficacy may be due to a heightened immune response against the parasite. Further studies are necessary to evaluate the long-term clinical outcome of combination protocols and to establish the most efficient treatment for HWD in dogs.

AB A key goal in the control of canine visceral leishmaniosis (CVL) has been the development of vaccines with a highly protective capability to interrupt the parasite transmission cycle. However, in addition to promising vaccine searches, researchers have sought to develop new drugs capable of eliminating parasites in humans and dogs. With that in mind, this study analyzed an immunotherapeutic approach in dogs naturally infected with Leishmania infantum. Fourteen dogs were divided into two groups and received a protocol of immunotherapeutic treatment with five doses of total antigens of Leishmania amazonensis or total antigens of L. amazonensis plus saponin (LaSap). All the animals were evaluated before and 90 and 180 days after treatment, hematology, liver and renal biochemical analyzes, serology, lymphoproliferation, and parasite load by qPCR. The results of immunotherapy with the LaSap vaccine were promising since it was able to preserve hematological and biochemical parameters, as well as improve the clinical status, reduce serum levels of IgG, induce a lymphoproliferative capacity against soluble antigens of L. infantum, and provide a marked reduction in the parasite load after LaSap immunotherapeutic treatment. The immunotherapy data demonstrated that LaSap offered the best formulation to induce clinical cure associated with a parasite load reduction in the skin. However, after 180 days of treatment, the animals again showed a slight increase in parasitism, indicating that immunotherapy does not promote sterilizing cure and a new immunotherapeutic intervention would be necessary to maintain low parasitism in dogs.

AB We have set up an ex vivo ovine abomasal model, which can mimic the multicellular process to explore the early steps in haemonchine nematode infection using RNA-seq technology. Ovine abomasal explants were collected for histological and transcriptional analysis and supernatants collected to quantitate lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) enzymes. Atotal of 233 were substantially induced genes between L4-inoculated and uninoculated-control tissues, respectively. However, a total of 14 were considerably down-regulated genes between the 51 aforementioned tissues. Fifteen pathways were annotated by Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes, and Genomes pathway analysis accounted for the significant percentage in immediate response to larval-stage of H. contortus. Key genes upregulated in response to the addition of L4-inoculum of H. contortus were IL-6, IL-8, Clq, Atypical chemokine receptor-3, chemokine ligand-2, manganese superoxide dismutase, integrin alpha-7,-8,-9, integrin subunit beta 1, integrin subunit beta 6, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and actin alpha-1. This study shows for the first time that galectin-1 is up-regulated in an ex vivo abomasal segment model exposed to L4-inoculum of H. contortus following 6 h of incubation. The abomasal segment model has been shown to be a suitable tool to study the haemonchine larval-stage effects on the ovine abomasal tissues prior to in vivo assessment.

AB Metastrongyloid parasites represent sparsely studied parasites of dogs and cats in Germany. Recent European surveys indicate that these parasites are spreading in Europe. Actual data on prevalence of Angiostrongylus vasorwn in dogs and foxes reveal several endemic foci in Germany. However, actual data on the prevalence of A. vasorum and other metastrongyloid lungworm larvae in a wide range of slug and snail intermediate hosts, such as Anion lusitanicus, are missing for Germany. To fill this gap, we conducted an epidemiological survey on native German slugs in selected regions of Hesse and Rhineland-Palatinate. The focus was on slugs, because in study areas slugs appear to be more abundant than snails. Slugs were collected throughout different seasons of the year in areas that were previously proven to be hyperendemic for A. vasorum fox infections. Overall, a total of 2701 slugs were collected and examined for lungworm larvae via artificial digestion. The number of A. vasorum larvae per slug varied considerably (1-546 larvae per specimen). Some hotspot areas with high A. vasorum prevalence in slugs (up to 19.4%) were identified. The overall A. vasorum prevalence varied with season with largest number of slugs infected in summer (9.1%) and lowest number in winter (0.8%). The current study revealed a total A. vasorum prevalence of 4.7% in slugs based on microscopic analyses. Confirmation of lungworm species was made by specific duplex-real-time PCRs. Hence, these data demonstrate that final hosts are at a permanent risk for A. vasorum infections during all seasons when living in investigated areas. Besides A. vasorum, other lungworm larvae were also detected, such as Crenosoma vulpis (the fox lungworm, 2.3%) and Aelurostrongylus abstrusus (feline lungworm, 0.2%).

ID ANGIOSTRONGYLUS-VASORUM; GREAT-BRITAIN; PREVALENCE; ENGLAND
AB Over the past four decades, there has been an exponential increase in veterinary parasitology knowledge, coinciding with the advent of molecular biology in research. Therefore, it is unrealistic for teachers to expect students to graduate with an encyclopaedic knowledge of the subject. As a result, a new curriculum was introduced at The Royal Veterinary College (University of London) in 2007, designed to meet the needs of our new graduates, i.e. RCVS Day-One Competences. The aims of this curriculum are, inter alia, to ensure that new graduates have an up-to-date body of core knowledge and are able to apply such knowledge and newly-acquired information to scientific and clinical problem-solving. Veterinary parasitology is taught primarily in Year 2, following a brief introduction in Year 1; clinical aspects are covered in Year 3, with original research projects undertaken in Years 4 and 5. Parasitology is taught in parallel with other subjects, enabling both horizontal and vertical integration. Core material is provided in lectures supplemented by directed learning (DL) in small groups and interactive, clinical scenario-based practical classes. Student learning is supported by Moodle 3.2 (Virtual Learning Environment [VLE], RVC Learn) which provides access to an on-line study guide (annotated using Adobe Reader), PowerPoint presentations with synchronized lecturer commentary (Echo Active Learning Platform [ALP]), detailed feedback for DL and practical classes, parasite 'potcasts' and CAL packages, and a Clinical Skills Centre. A parasitology textbook has also been published recently to support courses taught at the College. Assessment of student learning is achieved using a variety of written formats (essay, problem-solving questions [PSQ], multiple choice questions [MCQ] and extended matching questions [EMQ]), integrated oral examinations and objective structured clinical examinations (OSCEs).

AB This study evaluated the acaricidal activity of the methanol extract of Acmella oleracea with 0.187% of spilanthol against immature stages of Amblyomma sculptum. The packet test was used to evaluate the extract's activity on unengorged larvae and nymphs, testing concentrations of 0.4 to 50 mg/mL for larvae and 12.5 to 200.0 mg/mL for nymphs. For the engorged stages, the immersion test was used, at concentrations of 0.4 to 50 mg/mL for larvae and 12.5 to 200.0 mg/mL for nymphs. The methanol extract caused 100% mortality of the unengorged larvae and nymphs starting at concentrations of 12.5 and 200.0 mg/mL, respectively. For engorged larvae and nymphs, the mortality was 100% starting from concentrations of 12.5 and 150.0 mg/mL, respectively. The LC50 for unengorged larvae was 3.2 mg/mL, while for engorged larvae it was 6.6 mg/mL. For unengorged nymphs, the LC50 was 38.5 mg/mL, but it was not possible to calculate the corresponding value for engorged nymphs because the data did not fit the probit model. These results demonstrate that the methanol extract of A. oleracea has acaricidal activity against different immature stages of A. sculptum.

AB The initiative One World, "One Health" tries to rapidly detect emerging or reemerging human and animal infectious diseases and prevent epidemiological situations such as deforestation, some agricultural practices or the appearance of new foci of leishmaniosis due to Leishmania infantum with alternative reservoirs.
   With this objective in mind, we here consider leishmaniosis in the Mediterranean basin and compare its current clinical management from two perspectives: that of a veterinarian specialized in infectious and parasitic diseases, and that of a physician specialized in infectious tropical diseases. We thus prepared a list of 10 key questions from epidemiology to control of the disease in both species: dogs and humans. This issue requires a concise and clear response to help animal and human health clinicians to improve their clinical management and understanding of this important zoonosis. Our ultimate aim is to update and bring together the information available backed by sound scientific evidence.

AB Ticks are haematophagous arthropods which rank closely with mosquitoes in their capacity to transmit disease pathogens of importance to animals and humans. Current control of ticks is based on the routine use of synthetic chemicals administered to animals or their environment. However, years of use and overuse of these chemicals have resulted in the development of resistance in these parasites and negative environmental impacts, hence the need for cheaper, safer and more environmentally friendly alternatives with alternate modes of action. There has been a large interest in using plants for these purposes. Peer-reviewed articles on plants evaluated for their tick repellent and/or acaricidal activities against immature and adult stages of ticks were collected from nine scientific databases with the aim of reviewing the bioassays employed. Search words included "acaricidal", "tick repellent", "antitick assays" and "phytomedicine". Many different methods were used to determine repellency and acaricidal activity. These include, among a few others, petri dish, tick climbing, olfactometer, larval packet and immersion bioassays. Tick climbing repellency and adult immersion bioassays were most commonly used. Ethanol was the most widely used solvent and Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus was the most commonly studied tick across all the reviewed papers. It is unclear whether the outcome of these experiments on a one-host tick can be applied to other species of ticks that infest animals and humans. Also, most of the assays on repellency did not discriminate between olfaction and tactile chemoreception-based repellency and though some of the observed methods were similar, results differ significantly. These aspects will need further evaluation. Standardized laboratory methods are required to enable the valid comparisons between results from different laboratories.

AB Patient-side test kits for detecting antigenemia in dogs associated with sexually mature female heartworms (Dirofilaria immitis) have been available for three decades, and these tests are continually updated and improved. To define the sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) of contemporary antigen detection tests against cardiopulmonary D. immitis burden, we evaluated five patient-side kits-Anigen Rapid One Step (R) (Bio note), SNAP (R) 4Dx Plus Test Kit (IDEXX), WITNESS (R) Heartworm Canine Heartworm Antigen Test Kit (Zoetis), VetScan (R) Canine Heartworm Rapid Test (Abaxis), and Solo Step (R) CH Canine Heartworm Antigen Test (Heska), and one microplate ELISA (DiroCHEK (R); Zoetis), using archived canine sera divided into five subclasses of female worms (0, 1-5, 6-20, 21-40, and > 40). The patient-side tests were performed once, side-by-side according to each manufacturer's protocol by personnel blinded to the D. immitis status of each dog. The overall Se and Sp of the patient side kits was >= 97.5 and = 94.0%, respectively. For samples from dogs with 1-5, 6-20, and 21-40 D. immitis, the Se was between 96 and 100%, with a slight increase in Se in dogs with >= 41 worms. The agreement between tests for all subclasses of D. immitis burden was between 99 and 100%. The Se and Sp for the ELISA compared with the necropsy results of dogs was 99 and 96%, respectively. Agreement between each patient-side test and the ELISA was between 97 and 100%. All commercially available tests can give practitioners excellent patient-side information, allowing them to make informed decisions on the need for additional diagnostic work-up before instituting new or continuing D. immitis prophylaxis.

So it is necessary to keep in mind why and how bladder cancer cells survive in our body. In this study, we explored the function and the molecular mechanism of GGN gene in bladder cancer. GGN was shown to be expressed at a high level in bladder cancer tissues compared to the control and was associated with the unsatisfactory survival rate of patients. GGN was also expressed abundantly in bladder cancer cell lines such as T24, 5637 and BIU87. Then GGN was knocked down in 5637 cells and T24 cells at both RNA and protein level. In accordance, aberrant growth and proliferation were demonstrated in bladder cancer cells. The ability of migration and invasion of bladder cancer cells was also inhibited. The in vivo data further proved that the xenograft tumor growth was dramatically suppressed by GGN knockdown. Then we demonstrated that the level of I kappa B, bax and truncated caspase3 was upregulated after GGN was knocked down in 5637 cells. In contrast, expression level of NF kappa B, IKK, c-Myc, cyclin D1 and Bcl-2 was reduced. Further, the phosphorylation level of I kappa B was also downregulated. These data suggest that NF kappa B/caspase3-mediated apoptosis signaling was regulated by GGN. Conclusively, GGN played a tumor-promoting role in bladder cancer through regulation of NF kappa B/caspase3-mediated apoptosis signaling. This study provides a new clue for the treatment of patients with bladder cancer.

AB Objective: Autophagy plays a prominent role in the pathogenesis of plaques formation and progression of atherosclerosis (AS). The cysteine protease legumain is known to participate in atherogenesis, but its function and underlying mechanism in AS macrophages remain unclear.
   Methods: The expressions of legumain in plaques isolated from AS patients and in macrophages stimulated with oxLDL were examined. Moreover, we effectively altered legumain expression in macrophages to characterize the effect of legumain on oxLDL-induced macrophage apoptosis. The expression of apoptotic and autophagic factors was analysed.
   Results: Legumain was present in plaques, and its expression was upregulated in macrophages treated with oxLDL. Suppressing legumain significantly increased oxLDL-induced macrophage apoptosis and the expression of caspase 3, caspase 9 and Bax. However, legumain overexpression decreased macrophage apoptosis upon oxLDL exposure and the levels of caspase 3, caspase 9 and Bax. In addition, recombinant legumain protein suppressed macrophage apoptosis. Biochemical experiments revealed that legumain deficiency decreased the levels of Beclin1 and LC3, whereas increased legumain expression increased the levels of Beclin1 and LC3 significantly.
   Conclusion: Legumain regulates oxLDL-induced macrophage apoptosis by enhancing the autophagy pathway, which may also influence the vulnerability of atherosclerotic plaques.

AB Prohibitin (PHB) is a ubiquitous, evolutionarily conserved protein that is mainly localized in the inner mitochondria] membrane and exerts various mitochondrial functions. Here, we first cloned the phb gene from P. esculenta. The Pe-PHB protein has high homology and a similar protein structure to that of other animals, and it can be divided into the N-terminal hydrophobic/transmembrane domain, SPFH domain, and C-terminal coiled-coil domain. The Pe-phb gene is widely expressed, and the gene expression of phb is highest in coelomic fluid where spermiogenesis occurs, indicating a specific function in the coelom. We further observed continuous expression of the pith gene and localization of PHB proteins in mitochondria during spermiogenesis, indicating that PHB, as a mitochondrial component, may play a role during this process via its mitochondrial function. In addition, ubiquitination of mitochondria was detected, and the PHB signal was co-localized with the polyubiquitin signal during spermiogenesis. Mature sperm also showed ubiquitination of mitochondria and PHB. Therefore, PHB may be a substrate of poly-ubiquitin to regulate the ubiquitination of mitochondria and even subsequent elimination during P. esculenta spermiogenesis, and it has a potential role in guaranteeing the maternal inheritance of mitochondria. Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that PHB participates in the spermiogenesis of P. esculenta by maintaining the normal function of mitochondria and regulating the degradation of mitochondria.

AB Osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) is a common orthopedic disease associated with high disability, and femoral neck fracture (FNF) is one of the most common reasons for traumatic ONFH. This study was designed to reveal the mechanisms underlying ONFH. Using fastx_toolkit and prinseq-lite tools, quality control was conducted for the sequencing data. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs, including both mRNAs and lncRNAs) between ONFH and FNF samples were identified using the edgeR package in R, and were then subjected to enrichment analysis using the BioCloud platform. Subsequently, protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed using Cytoscape software. After the target genes of DE-lncRNAs were predicted based on Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, IncRNA-gene coexpression network was visualized using the Cytoscape software. Furthermore, functional enrichment analysis was carried out for the target genes using the clusterprofiler package in R. Additionally, the key genes were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). A total of 2965 DEGs were identified from the ONFH samples, including 602 DE-lncRNAs (such as downregulated FAM201A). In the PPI networks, eight upregulated genes (including FGF2, IGF1, SOX9, and COL2A1) and 11 downregulated genes were among the top 20 genes according to all of the scores, such as degree centrality, closeness centrality, and betweenness centrality scores. Functional enrichment analysis showed that IGF1, SOX9, and COL2A1 were significantly enriched during skeletal system development. Moreover, qRT-PCR experiments detected the upregulation of FGF2 and downregulation of FAM201A in ONFH samples. FGF2 and FAM201A were correlated with the development of ONFH. Besides, IGF1, SOX9, and COL2A1 might also affect the pathogenesis of ONFH.

AB Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a head and neck cancer associated with poor prognosis. Many studies have shown that the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is important in cancer progression, metastasis, and chemotherapy resistance and that microRNAs (miRNAs) play a key role in chemotherapy resistance associated with EMT. The miRNA miR-139-5p is downregulated in many human cancers and is closely related to tumor progression. The aim of this study was to investigate the ability of miR-139-5p to influence the cisplatin resistance, apoptosis, invasion and migration in NPC cells through the regulation of the EMT. We investigated these processes in parental HNE1 and cisplatin-resistant HNE1/DDP cells transfected with miR-139-5p inhibitors and mimics, respectively. Our results suggest that the upregulation of miR-139-5p expression inhibits proliferation, invasion, migration and EMT in human NPC cells. In addition, we found that miR-139-5p expression levels and DDP-induced apoptosis positively correlate in NPC cells. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that miR-139-5p can regulate the migration, invasion and DDP resistance in human NPC by modulating the EMT. The regulation of miR-139-5p levels might be a new approach to reverse EMT and DDP resistance and counteract metastasis and chemotherapy resistance in human NPC.

AB Mitochondrial DNA mutations play an important role in hereditary hearing loss. The present study aimed at identifying more novel genetic variants of mitochondrial DNA. Complete Mitochondrial genomes were detected in 97 Northwestern Chinese probands with non-syndromic hearing loss and 376 control subjects. The variants were evaluated for the pathogenicity using the following criteria: (1) present in < 1% of the controls, (2) evolutional conservation, (3) potential structural and functional alterations. Mutational analysis in probands identified 706 variants, including 180 variants in the D loop region, 27 variants in the 12S rRNA gene, 29 variants in the 16S rRNA gene, 122 missense variants and 312 silent variants in the protein coding gene, 29 variants in the tRNA genes and 7 variants in the non-coding region. After further analysis assessed for the potential structural and functional significance, we identified 5 new candidate variants for hearing loss: 12S rRNA1473C > T, tRNA(Phe) 614A > C, tRNA(LYs) 8339A > G, ND1 3866T > C and non-coding 5656A > G. Our findings may provide the role of these genes in hearing loss development in China and valuable information for the further understanding of pathogenic mechanism of hearing loss.

AB Favism is an acute hemolytic syndrome caused by the ingestion of fava bean (FB) in glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficient individuals. However, little is known about the global transcripts alteration in liver tissue after FB ingestion in G6PD-normal and-deficient states. In this study, deep sequencing was used to analyze liver genes expression alterations underlying the effects of FB in C3H (Wild Type, WT) and G6PD-deficient (G6PDx) mice and to evaluate and visualize the collective annotation of a list of genes to Gene Ontology (GO) terms associated with favism. Our results showed that FB resulted in a decrease of glutathione (GSH)-to-oxidized glutathione (GSSG) ratio and an increase of malondialdehyde (MDA) both in the G6PDx and WT-control check (CK) mice plasma. Significantly, liver transcript differences were observed between the control and FB-treated groups of both WT and G6PDx mice. A total of 320 differentially expressed transcripts were identified by comparison of G6PDx-CK with WT-CK and were associated with immune response and oxidation-reduction function. A total of 149 differentially expressed genes were identified by comparison of WT-FB with WT-CK. These genes were associated with immune response, steroid metabolic process, creatine kinase activity, and fatty acid metabolic process. A total of 438 differential genes were identified by comparing G6PDx-FB with G6PD-CK, associated with the negative regulation of fatty acid metabolic process, endoplasmic reticulum, iron binding, and glutathione transferase activity. These findings indicate that G6PD mutations may affect the functional categories such as immune response and oxidation-reduction.

AB A simple method for producing donut-shaped starch microparticles by adding ethanol to a heated aqueous slurry of corn starch is presented. The obtained microparticles were analysed by SEM, XRD and DSC. The average size of microparticles was 14.1 +/- 0.3 mu m with holes of an average size of 4.6 +/- 0.2 mu m. The crystalline arrangement of the microparticles was of a V-type single helix. The change in crystallinity from A-type of the starch granules to a more open structure, where water molecules could penetrate easier within the microparticles, substantially increased their solubility and swelling power. The microparticles exhibited a higher gelatinization temperature and a lower gelatinization enthalpy than did the starch granules. The donut-shaped microparticles were stable for more than 18 months and can be used as a carrier of an active compound or as a filler in bioplastics.

AB Egg white powder is widely used as a food ingredient instead of fresh eggs. Dry heat treatment plays an essential role in the processing of egg white powder to obtain its excellent functionalities. In this study, the effect of dry heat treatment on egg white protein (EWP) was evaluated by determining its physicochemical properties and in vitro pepsin digestion. The results indicated that dry heat treatment reduced EWP thermal stability and tryptophan fluorescence and increased its surface hydrophobicity. SDS-PAGE revealed that abundant soluble aggregates formed during dry heating, and these aggregates could be digested by pepsin. The digestibility of dry-heated EWP was better than for untreated EWP, and the essential amino acid and low-molecular-weight peptide (Mw < 1 kDa) contents increased with increasing dry heating time. In vitro digests of EWP that were dry heat treated for 9-15 days exhibited excellent antioxidant properties.

AB Crataegus dahurica Koehne is an edible wild fruit mainly distributed in Northeast China. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the chemical constituents and investigate the bioactivities of dried fruit of C. dahurica methanol extract (CdME). Through various chromatographic methods, thirty-five compounds were isolated from CdME for the first time and their structures were identified on the basis of physicochemical properties and spectroscopic data. The main structural types of these compounds were triterpenoids and polyphenolics. Pharmacological experiments results showed that CdME had potently antioxidant capacity and ethyl acetate fraction was the active part with the greatest antioxidant activities. Moreover, CdME especially n-butanol fraction significantly accelerated the gastrointestinal transit in mice (acceleration rate: 78.5 +/- 1.5% vs. 69.9 +/- 3.2% at a dose of 250 mg/kg, compared to the control group, P < .01). On the basis of these results, C. dahurica may be considered as a good resource of antioxidants and digestion-improving agents.

AB The data obtained with a polar or non-polar gas chromatography (GC) column coupled to ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) has been explored to classify Iberian ham, to detect possible frauds in their labelling. GC-IMS was used to detect the volatile compound profile of dry-cured Iberian ham from pigs fattened on acorn and pasture or on feed.
   Due to the two-dimensional nature of GC-IMS measurements, great quantities of data are obtained and an exhaustive chemometric processing is required. A first approach was based on the processing of the complete spectral fingerprint, while the second consisted of the selection of individual markers that appeared throughout the spectra. A classification rate of 90% was obtained with the first strategy, and the second approach correctly classified all Iberian ham samples according to the pigs' diet (classification rate of 100%). No significant differences were found between the GC columns tested in terms of classification rate.

AB Quantitative analysis and untargeted liquid chromatography mass spectrum (LC-MS) based metabolomics of different grades of Keemun black tea (KBT) were conducted. Quantitative analysis did not show tight correlation between tea grades and contents of polyphenols, but untargeted metabolomics analysis revealed that high-grades KBT were distinguished from the low-grades. S-plot and Variable Importance (VIP) analysis gave 28 marker compounds responsible for the discrimination of different grades of KBT. The inhibitory effects of KBT on alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase were positively correlated to tea grades, and the correlation coefficient between each marker compound and inhibitory rate were calculated. Thirteen compounds were positively related to the anti-glycemic activity, and theasinensin A, afzelechin gallate and kaempferol-glucoside were confirmed as grade-related bioactive marker compounds by chemical and bioassay in effective fractions. This study suggested that combinatory metabolomics and bioactivities assay provided a new strategy for the classification of tea grades.

AB Nanoencapsulation of lipophilic bioactive compounds in food biopolymers is important to functional beverages, but protein-based nanocapsules are unstable around the isoelectric point of protein. The objectives of this work were to study physicochemical properties of self-assembled curcumin-soluble soybean polysaccharide (SSPS) nanoparticles and evaluate the activities against proliferation of human colon HCT116 and mammary adenocarcinoma MCF-7 cancer cells before and after simulated digestions. Capsules with a hydrodynamic diameter of 200-300 nm and an encapsulation efficiency of similar to 90% were self-assembled after increasing curcumin-SSPS mixture to pH 12.0 and lowering pH to 7.0. The capsule dispersions were stable at pH 2.0-7.0 and after heating at 95 degrees C for 1 min. No significant difference was observed for the viability of HCT 116 and MCF-7 cells challenged with 0.4, 4.0, and 40 mu g/ml nanoencapsulated curcumin before and after simulated gastric and intestinal digestions. These findings may be significant to help develop functional beverages for disease prevention.

AB This work reports a novel approach to generate a new group of tyrosol-based amphiphilic lipid alkylsuccinylated tyrosol by lipase-catalyzed succinylation of tyrosol with alkylsuccinic anhydrides of varying alkyl chain lengths, in high yields (80-95%). The structures of the compounds were confirmed by MS, FTIR & H-1 NMR; and their properties were characterized by Temperature-Ramp FTIR, DSC & CMC measurements. The synthesized compounds integrate water-soluble phenylethanoid and hydrophobic alkyl into one molecule thus are endowed with dual functions: retaining the antioxidant property of tyrosol and entailing tyrosol with new surface-active property. The DPPH activity of tyrosol (13.77%) was significantly enhanced by 2-dodecen-1-ylsuccinylated tyrosol (16.01%). Compared to tyrosol-based emulsions (76.63%), the lipid oxidation is reduced to 21.57% and 42.32% in 2-octen-1-ylsuccinylated/ 2-dodecen-1-ylsuccinylated tyrosol emulsions, respectively. This work brings new members to the library of functional lipid excipients and open a novel and effective synthetic pathway for derivation of phenyl alcohols.

AB This study aimed to evaluate the effects of different stunning methods (percussion, T1; immersion in ice/water slurry, T2; gill cut, T3) on antioxidant status, in vivo myofibrillar protein (MP) oxidation, and the susceptibility to postmortem oxidation (induced by hydroxyl radical oxidizing system) of silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) fillets. Stress conditions, antioxidant enzyme activities, and protein oxidation parameters were analyzed during 72 h postmortem. The results indicated that the strongest stress conditions in the T3 group led to impaired glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) activity, and significantly (P < .05) higher carbonyl concentrations, thereby promoted in vivo MP oxidation of fillets. The T3 group also showed severe losses in myosin heavy chain (MHC) intensities and sulfhydryl groups at higher H2O2 concentrations. Overall, fillets from the T3 group were more susceptible to oxidative damage, and the T1 and T2 groups maintained better quality in terms of lower MP oxidation rates.

AB Emulsion-templated approach was adopted to obtain edible oleogels using hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) as the main emulsifier in combination with the usage of thickening agents such as carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), xanthan gum, sodium alginate, arabic gum, guar gum, flaxseed gum or locust bean gum. Polarized light microscopy (PLM) and rheological measurements were carried out to investigate the microstructure and mechanical strength of emulsions and their corresponding oleogels, respectively. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) analyses were employed to study the interaction between polysaccharides. Gel strength and oil binding capacity of oleogels were related to the mechanical strength of emulsions as well as to the network of soft solids. Oleogels with semi-crystalline structure were formed by the binding of liquid oil to polysaccharides, which were stabilized by the intramolecular or intermolecular molecular hydrogen bonds between polysaccharides.

AB Ice-binding proteins (IBPs), also known as antifreeze proteins, were added to ice cream to investigate their effect on structure and texture. Ice recrystallization inhibition was assessed in the ice cream mixes using a novel accelerated microscope assay and the ice cream microstructure was studied using an ice crystal dispersion method. It was found that adding recombinantly produced fish type III IBPs at a concentration 3 mg.L-1 made ice cream hard and crystalline with improved shape preservation during melting. Ice creams made with IBPs (both from winter rye, and type III IBP) had aggregates of ice crystals that entrapped pockets of the ice cream mixture in a rigid network. Larger individual ice crystals and no entrapment in control ice creams was observed. Based on these results a model of ice crystals aggregates formation in the presence of IBPs was proposed.

AB This work aims to explore the potential of near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy to quantify volatile compounds in Vinho Verde wines, commonly determined by gas chromatography. For this purpose, 105 Vinho Verde wine samples were analyzed using Fourier transform near infrared (FT-NIR) transmission spectroscopy in the range of 5435 cm(-1) to 6357 cm(-1). Boxplot and principal components analysis (PCA) were performed for clusters identification and outliers removal. A partial least square (PLS) regression was then applied to develop the calibration models, by a new iterative approach. The predictive ability of the models was confirmed by an external validation procedure with an independent sample set. The obtained results could be considered as quite good with coefficients of determination (R-2) varying from 0.94 to 0.97. The current methodology, using NIR spectroscopy and chemometrics, can be seen as a promising rapid tool to determine volatile compounds in Vinho Verde wines.

AB Oil-in-water emulsions were prepared with carrot-or tomato-enriched olive oil (5% w/v) and stabilized with Tween80 or sucrose esters (0.5% w/v) with different hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (8; 11 or 16). All emulsions had similar initial oil droplet sizes and were submitted to simulated gastrointestinal conditions using a kinetic digestion procedure. Sucrose esters induced an unstable system after gastric conditions leading to coalesced oil droplets, while Tween80 emulsions remained stable. Emulsion particle sizes at the end of the gastric phase were directly associated with the lipolysis kinetics during the intestinal phase. Moreover, a direct relationship was observed between lipolysis and carotenoid micellarisation for all emulsions, and depended mainly on the surfactant structure used. Tween80 emulsions led to a higher lipolysis extent (53-57%) and carotenoid bioaccessibility (17-42%) compared to sucrose ester emulsions (33-52% and 9-27%, respectively). These findings show the importance of the emulsifier structure and emulsion stability during gastrointestinal conditions in modulating lipolysis kinetics.

AB The growing demand for wholesome and nutritious food leads to intensification of production, which in turn can have a detrimental effect on quality and well-being of consumers. For that reason, it is important to develop novel methods of food control which would be characterized by a short time of analysis, adequate sensitivity and relatively low cost. One such technique involves the use of multi-sensory devices called electronic noses. In recent years there has been a rapid development of this method, especially in the area of food control. Electronic olfaction can be successfully used in the analysis of edible oils, in particular in the determination of the product's geographical origin, and in detection of adulteration as well as deterioration caused by external factors.

AB In this study, a novel ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF-MS/MS)-guidance strategy was proposed for preparation of sulfur-containing derivatives in sulfur-fumigated edible herbs. Being versatile in both chromatographic separation and mass spectrometric detection, UPLC-QTOF-MS/MS was inducted into each experimental step for multifaceted purposes including finding, tracking, purity determination and structural elucidation of targeted compounds as well as UPLC-HPLC chromatographic conditions transplantation, whereby the isolation and purification procedures were greatly facilitated. Using this strategy, a new sulfur-containing ginsenoside Rg(1) derivative (named compound I) was obtained from sulfur-fumigated ginseng. The chemical structure of compound I was elucidated to be (3 beta, 6 alpha, 12 beta)-3, 12-dihydroxydammar-25-ene-6, 20-diylbis-beta-D-glucopyranoside,24-sulfonic acid by QTOFMS/ MS, H-1-NMR and C-13-NMR analysis, and its generation mechanisms by sulfur-fumigation were accordingly discussed. The research deliverable suggests that the UPLC-QTOF-MS/MS-guidance strategy is promising for targeted preparation of sulfur-containing derivatives from sulfur-fumigated edible herbs.

AB Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy has been applied to many fields, however, it still encounters drawbacks in multicomponent mixtures analysis due to serious spectral overlapping. Here, an effective approach to quantitative analysis was proposed, and applied on the determination of the ternary amino acids in foxtail millet substrate. Utilizing three parameters derived from the THz-TDS, the images were constructed and the Tchebichef image moments were used to extract the information of target components. Then the quantitative models were obtained by stepwise regression. The correlation coefficients of leave-one-out cross-validation (R-loo-cv(2)) were more than 0.9595. As for external test set, the predictive correlation coefficients ( R-p(2)) were more than 0.8026 and the root mean square error of prediction (RMSEp) were less than 1.2601. Compared with the traditional methods (PLS and N-PLS methods), our approach is more accurate, robust and reliable, and can be a potential excellent approach to quantify multicomponent with THz-TDS spectroscopy.

AB Anthocyanin composition in forty-five Lycium ruthenicum Murray (LRM) samples grown in China was identified by high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionisation-mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS) and quantified by HPLC with a diode array detector (HPLC-DAD). The results showed that the overall pattern of anthocyanin composition of LRM from different provinces was the same, while the individual and total anthocyanin concentrations, were significantly different, indicating an important impact of geographical origin on anthocyanin composition, which can be considered as credible indices for LRM classification. Principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) were applied to develop discrimination models for the anthocyanin concentrations. PCA clearly separated the LRM based on its geographical origins. LDA satisfactorily categorized the samples by providing a 100% success rate based on geographical origins. The results obtained could be used to trace the geographical origin of LRM.

AB Water from La Pampa, Argentina, was used for washing and cooking rice to examine the in-situ impact of using naturally-contaminated water for food preparation on the elemental dietary intake. Whilst washing with the control tap water (28 mu g/L As) reduced the concentration of As in rice by 23%, the use of different well waters (281-1144 mu g/L) increased As levels significantly (8-227%) in comparison with the original concentration in the rice (0.056 mu g/g). Cooking the rice at a low water-to-rice ratio (2:1) using modern methods increased the levels of As in the cooked samples by 2-3 orders of magnitude for both pre-washed and un-washed rice. Similar trends were observed for vanadium. Although the levels of manganese, iron, copper, zinc and molybdenum in rice were reduced during washing and cooking for most water samples, the molybdenum concentration in the cooked rice doubled (2.2-2.9 mu g/g) when using water containing > 1 mg/L Mo.

AB Tomato peels by-product from a Tunisian industry was used for the extraction of lycopene-rich oleoresin using hexane solvent maceration. Tomato peels oleoresin, TPO, exhibited competitive free radicals scavenging activity with synthetic antioxidants. The efficacy of TPO in stabilizing refined olive (ROO) and sunflower (RSO) oils was investigated for five months, under accelerated shelf-life, compared to the synthetic antioxidant, butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). TPO was added to ROO and RSO at four different concentrations, namely 250, 500, 1000 and 2000 mu g/g and BHT standard at 200 mu g/g. Lipid oxidation was tracked by measuring the peroxide value, acidity, conjugated dienes and trienes. Results suggested the highest efficiency of 250 mu g/g and 2000 mu g/g of TPO, referring to 5 mu g/g and 40 mu g/g of lycopene, for the oxidative stabilization of ROO and RSO, respectively. The protective effect of TPO against the primary oxidation of these refined oils was significantly correlated to their lycopene contents.

AB The all-polysaccharide based polyelectrolyte microcapsules combining copigmentation for anthocyanin encapsulation and stabilization were fabricated. Copigmented complexes of chondroitin sulfate and anthocyanin were preloaded in CaCO3 scaffold, and then microcapsules were created by coating the sacrificial CaCO3 using layer-by-layer technique. It was observed that the preloading of copigmented complex affected the precipitation reaction of CaCO3 and the subsequent entrapment of anthocyanin. With addition of anthocyanin from 0.125 to 0.75 mg, copigmentation can significantly increase the encapsulation efficiency of anthocyanin in CaCO3, whereas such effect was not obvious at higher loadings. The leakage of anthocyanin during CaCO3 core dissolution and storage was also inhibited by two polysaccharide layers coupled with copigmentation, which may be related to the formation of interconnecting networks. Additionally, a higher anthocyanin antioxidant activity was provided by carbohydrate matrix. These findings may allow for the encapsulation of large amounts of water-soluble components; particularly natural colorant by copigmented complex-polyelectrolyte structures.

AB A fast, sensitive and reliable method for the determination of fipronil and its metabolites in tea and chrysanthemum was developed using a modified QuEChERS technique and an ultra performance liquid chromatography Q-Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometry. The mixture of adsorbents containing primary secondary amine (PSA), octadecylsilane (C-18) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs), was used as QuEChERS adsorbents. The use of mass resolution at 70000 full width at half maximum (FWHM) and narrow mass windows at 5 ppm achieved high selectivity and repeatability. Satisfactory linearity with correlative coefficient (R-2) higher than 0.996 was achieved for all compounds. Recoveries at three levels (2, 10 and 50 mu g kg(-1)) ranged from 86% to 112%, while the intra- and inter-day accuracies were less than 15%. Limits of quantification for fipronil and its metabolites were 2 mu g kg(-1), which fulfils the requirement of maximum residue limits formulated by European Union and Japan.

AB beta-D-Galactosidase is an important enzyme in the dairy industry, and the enzyme from the yeast Kluyveromyces lactis is most widely used. Here, we report immobilization of the enzyme on a silica/chitosan composite support, devised to have 10% and 20% chitosan (SiQT10 and SiQT20, respectively). Morphological and textural characterizations showed that chitosan is dispersed in micrometric regions in silica. For comparison, a silica organofunctionalized with 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (SiO(2)aptms) was prepared. Performance of the biocatalysts was tested for lactose hydrolysis, and the enzyme immobilized in SiQT10 and SiQT20 composites showed higher efficiency (62% and 47%, respectively) compared with the enzyme in SiO(2)aptms. Operational stability in this system was evaluated for the first time. After 200 h of continuous use in a fixed-bed reactor, SiQT10 remained with approximately 90% activity. Thus, in addition to demonstrating compatibility for food processing, these results align the enzyme stabilization properties of chitosan with the mechanical resistance of silica.

AB Broccoli by-products from frozen-food industry account for 45% of the initial broccoli heads. They consist on stalks, inflorescences, and leaves, blanched and non-blanched, sharing the nutritional value and bioactive compounds of commercial broccoli heads. However, their high perishability prevents further valorisation. Therefore, in this study microwave hydrodiffusion and gravity (MHG) technology was used to dehydrate broccoli by-products and simultaneously recover the water-soluble diffused compounds for food ingredients use. The hydrodiffusion allowed to obtain a dried material with 12% moisture in 43 min when 550 g of broccoli byproducts were used, preserving polysaccharides and proteins. Diffused water contained up to 317 mu g/mL gallic acid equivalents of phenolic compounds, 11 mg/mL free sugars, 9 mg/ mL amino acids, and 356 mu g/mL glucosinolates, depending on the type of by-product used. These results show the potential of MHG technology for valorisation of broccoli by-products by its simultaneous stabilization by dehydration and extraction of bioactive compounds.

AB Organic products are generally recognized to be healthier and safer than conventional products. However, the actual scientific data regarding the importance of organic production on particular contaminant/additive content of wines is scarce. This study aimed to evaluate contents of pesticides, metals, sulphites and ochratoxin A in organically (org) and conventionally (conv) produced wines from eleven locations in different winegrowing regions of Croatia. All wines contained significantly lower levels of residues as compared to the maximum limits (MLs) with the exception of excessive amounts of Cu and Zn in one sample. Pb and Mg were mainly significantly less represented in org wines. There were no significant differences in the content of sulphite or ochratoxin A between org and conv wines. Significantly lower total pesticide concentrations and average number of pesticides per sample were obtained in org wines. The majority of ochratoxin A positive wines were from conv wine producers.

AB In this study a simple and fast multi-class method for the determination of veterinary drugs in bovine liver, kidney and muscle was developed. The method employed acetonitrile for extraction followed by clean-up with EMR-Lipid (R) sorbent and trichloracetic acid. Tests indicated that the use of TCA was most effective when added in the final step of the clean-up procedure instead of during extraction. Different sorbents were tested and optimized using central composite design and the analytes determined by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatographic-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). The method was validated according the European Commission Decision 2002/657 presenting satisfactory results for 69 veterinary drugs in bovine liver and 68 compounds in bovine muscle and kidney. The method was applied in real samples and in proficiency tests and proved to be adequate for routine analysis. Residues of abamectin, doramectin, eprinomectin and ivermectin were found in samples of bovine muscle and only ivermectin in bovine liver.

AB Rheological, microstructural and emulsifying properties of fish gelatin phosphorylated using sodium trimetaphosphate (STMP) were studied. Phosphorylation was carried out at 50 degrees C for 0, 0.5, 1 or 2 h. Rheological behaviors indicated that phosphorylation decreased gelation rate constant (k(gel)) and apparent viscosity of gelatin solutions. Phosphorylation time was inversely proportional to tan delta; gelling and melting points of fish gelatin gels; however gel properties could be improved by short time of phosphorylation. Scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy revealed that longer time of phosphorylation resulted in looser gel network with more aggregation. Longer phosphorylation time could stabilize fish gelatin emulsions, and endowed emulsions with smaller particle size and lower coefficient viscosity, but higher zeta-potential values. These results suggested that phosphorylation could be applied to obtain fish gelatin with varying functional properties suitable for numerous industrial applications.

AB In this study, a paper-based microfluidic enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed as a screening system for rapid detection of clenbuterol, which is illegally used as a growth promoter for food-producing animals. The microfluidic paper-based analytical device (mu PAD) was combined with ELISA and the intrinsic properties of paper allowed the entrapment of antibody through cellulosic fibres, validating to be an alternative to 96-well ELISA microplate for food safety monitoring. Detection of clenbuterol in milk was achieved by measuring the intensity of colour change that was proportional to the analyte concentration with a detection limit of 0.2 ppb. The mu PAD effectively reduces the cost, volume of reagents, and time required to run ELISA for food sample testing.

AB The yield of the Maillard reaction intermediate (MRI), prepared in aqueous medium, is usually unsatisfactory. However, the addition of sodium sulfite could improve the conversion of xylose-phenylalanine (Xyl-Phe) to the MRI (N-(1-deoxy-D-xylulos-1-yl)-phenylalanine) in aqueous medium. Sodium sulfite (Na2SO3) showed a significant pH-buffering effect during the Maillard reaction, which accounted for its facilitation of the N-(1-deoxy-D-xylulos-1-yl)-phenylalanine yield. The results revealed that the pH could be maintained at a relatively high level (above 7.0) for an optimized pH-buffering effect when Na2SO3 (4.0%) was added before the reaction of Xyl-Phe. Thus, the conversion of Xyl-Phe to N-(1-deoxy-D-xylulos-1-yl)-phenylalanine increased from 47.23% to 74.86%. Furthermore, the addition moment of Na2SO3 and corresponding solution pH were crucial factors in regulating the pH-buffering effect of Na2SO3 on N-(1-deoxy-D-xylulos-1-yl)-phenylalanine yield. Based on the pH-buffering effect of Na2SO3 and maintaining the optimal pH 7.4 relatively stable, the conversion of Xyl-Phe to N-(1-deoxy-D-xylulos-1-yl)-phenylalanine was successfully improved.

AB In this study, we formulated and stabilized oil-in-water nanoemulsions using a crude extract from argan press-cake as sole emulsifier. Various extracts from argan press-cake were prepared in order to select the most surfaceactive one(s) foreseeing emulsions preparation. Fifty percent (v/v) ethanolic extract reduced the interfacial tension to a minimum value at both MCT oil and soybean oil interfaces (12.7 and 10.5 mNm(-1) respectively). This extract was also effective at producing fine emulsions with small droplet sizes (d(3,2) < 115 nm) and good physical stability using different oils such as soybean oil, MCT oil and fish oil and at conventional homogenization conditions (100 MPa for 4 passes). On the other hand, the emulsions were very sensitive to NaCl addition (>= 25 mM) and to acidic pH (< 3) indicating that the main stabilization mechanism is electrostatic, likely due to the presence of surface-active compounds with ionizable groups such as saponins.

AB The effect of the Lactobacillus casei 01 and inulin addition on sheep milk ice cream during storage (-18 degrees C, 150 days) was investigated. Control, probiotic and synbiotic ice cream (10% w/w sheep milk cream; 10% w/w sheep milk cream, L. casei 01, 6 log CFU/mL; 10% w/w inulin, L. casei 01, 6 log CFU/mL, respectively) were manufactured. Microbiological counts (probiotic count, survival after in vitro gastrointestinal resistance, Caco-2 cell adhesion), bioactivity and microstructure were analysed. Physical and textural characteristics, colour parameters, thermal analysis and organic acids/volatile compounds were also evaluated. All formulations supported L. casei 01 viability and maintained above the minimum therapeutic level (> 6 log CFU/mL) during storage. Inulin did not affect L. casei 01 survival after the passage through simulated gastrointestinal tract and adhesion to Caco-2 cells while improved the ACE-inhibitory and antioxidant activity. L. casei 01 addition produced several volatile compounds, such as carboxylic acids, alcohols, aldehydes and ketones. Also, scanning electron microscopy showed an interaction between probiotic bacteria and inulin fibre on synbiotic ice cream and the adhesion of L. casei to Caco-2 cells was observed.

AB Hot-melt extrusion (HME) has gained increasing attention in the pharmaceutical industry; however, its potential in the preparation of solid self-emulsifying drug delivery systems (S-SMEDDS) is still unexplored. This study sought to prepare enteric S-SMEDDS by HME and evaluate the effects of the process and formulation variables on S-SMEDDS properties via Box-Behnken design. Liquid SMEDDS were developed, and carvedilol was used as a class II model drug. Mean size, polydispersity index (PdI) and zeta potential of the resulting microemulsions were determined. The extrudates were then obtained by blending the lipid mixture and HPMCAS using a twin-screw hot-melt extruder. SEM, optical microscopy and PXRD were used to characterize the extrudates. In vitro microemulsion reconstitution and drug release were also studied. L-SMEDDS gave rise to microemulsions with low mean size, PdI and zeta potential (140.04 +/- 7.22 nm, 0.219 +/- 0.011 and -9.77 +/- 0.86 mV). S-SMEDDS were successfully prepared by HME, and an HMPCAS matrix was able to avoid microemulsion reconstitution and retain drug release in pH 1.2 (12.97%-25.54%). Conversely, microemulsion reconstitution and drug release were gradual in pH 6.8 and complete for some formulations. Extrudates prepared at the lowest drug concentration and highest temperature and recirculation time promoted a complete and rapid drug release in pH 6.8 giving rise to small and uniform microemulsion droplets.

AB Purpose: Several active compounds are sensitive to light, especially to the ultraviolet radiation (UV-R) leading to their degradation or modification, with lost or decrease of their biological activity. The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review regarding photostabilization strategies used on health products and perform a critical appraisal of their effectiveness.
   Results: The bibliographic search identified 2261 results and merely 40 studies met the selection criteria. Of these, 85% referred to encapsulation strategies, 10% to antioxidants and 5% to the use of solar filters. Cyclodextrins (CD's) were the most used encapsulation systems (32.5%) followed by liposomes and lipid nanoparticles (each 17.5%), microparticles (15%) and polymeric nanoparticles (10%). The most effective were found to be liposomes and lipid nanoparticles. However, the different methodological conditions used limit the true relevance of this finding.
   Conclusions: A gold standard strategy suitable for all compounds cannot be proposed. Instead, case-by-case evaluation, supported on the photodegradation mechanism is recommended. Systematic studies that compare different photostabilization strategies undertaken with the same irradiation conditions are also needed.

AB In this study, Compritol ATO-based Resveratrol colloidal carriers (CCCs) were prepared and subjected to characterization and evaluation. In most formulae, the use of a binary-mixture of surfactants improved the physicochemical properties. CCC6 (containing P407/P188 as bi-surfactants) attained the highest drug loading, release efficiency during 24 h and occlusive effect for 48 h; in addition, it showed a uniform particle size distribution within the desired range. In-vivo studies were done based on the analysis of anti-oxidant markers [catalase (CAT), reduced glutathione (GSH) and superoxide dismutase (SOD)], anti-inflammatory markers [interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 8 (IL-8) and rat Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B)] and anti-wrinkling markers [matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-1) and Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)], after UVB-irradiation. Results were significantly different when comparing the positive control and the negative control groups (p < 0.05). Rats pre-treated with CCC6 showed a great amelioration, and the level of the biochemical markers was significantly different compared to those of the positive control group and those pretreated with the drug suspension (p < 0.05). Also, the high skin protective effect of CCC6 was proved by visual and histopathological examination of the rats' skin. Therefore, the current study proves the beneficial effects of the designed dermal Resveratrol-loaded colloidal system.

AB Vitamin K deficiency within neonates can result in vitamin K deficiency bleeding. Ensuring that newborns receive vitamin K is particularly critical in places where access to health care and blood products and transfusions is limited. The World Health Organization recommends that newborns receive a 1 mg intramuscular injection of vitamin K at birth. Evidence from multiple surveillance studies shows that the introduction of vitamin K prophylaxis reduces the incidence of vitamin K deficiency bleeding. Despite these recommendations, coverage of vitamin K prophylactic treatment in low-resource settings is limited.
   An intramuscular injection is the most common method of vitamin K administration in neonates. In low-and middle-income countries, needle sharing may occur, which may result in the spread of bloodborne diseases. The objective of our study was to investigate the manufacture of microneedles for the delivery of vitamin K. Following microneedle fabrication, we performed insertion studies to assess the microneedle's mechanical properties. Results indicate that vitamin K in a microneedle array was successfully delivered in vitro across neonatal porcine skin with 1.80 +/- 0.08 mg delivered over 24 h. Therefore, this initial study shows that microneedles do have the potential to prevent vitamin K deficiency bleeding. Future work will assess delivery of vitamin K in microneedle array in vivo.

AB Selective laser sintering (SLS) is a three-dimensional printing (3DP) technology employed to manufacture plastic, metallic or ceramic objects. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of using SLS to fabricate novel solid dosage forms with accelerated drug release properties, and with a view to create orally disintegrating formulations. Two polymers (hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC E5) and vinylpyrrolidonevinyl acetate copolymer (Kollidon (R) VA 64)) were separately mixed with 5% paracetamol (used as a model drug) and 3% Candurin (R) Gold Sheen colorant; the powder mixes were subjected to SLS printing, resulting in the manufacture of printlets (3DP tablets). Modulating the SLS printing parameters altered the release characteristics of the printlets, with faster laser scanning speeds accelerating drug release from the HPMC formulations. The same trend was observed for the Kollidon (R) based printlets. At a laser scanning speed of 300 mm/s, the Kollidon (R) printlets exhibited orally disintegrating characteristics by completely dispersing in < 4 s in a small volume of water. X-ray micro-CT analysis of these printlets indicated a reduction in their density and an increase in open porosity, therefore, confirming the unique disintegration behaviour of these formulations. The work reported here is the first to demonstrate the feasibility of SLS 3DP to fabricate printlets with accelerated drug release and orally disintegrating properties. This investigation has confirmed that SLS is amenable to the pharmaceutical research of modern medicine manufacture.

AB It was the aim of this study to elucidate the impact of the injection mold temperature upon the polymer crystallinity, its microstructure and the resulting drug release from immediate and sustained release tablets containing semi-crystalline polymers. The immediate release formulation contained 20% (w/w) ketoprofen (KETO) in poly (ethylene oxide) (PEO) and the sustained release formulation contained 20-40% (w/w) metoprolol tartrate (MPT) in polycaprolactone (PCL). Physical mixtures of drug-polymer were characterized via isothermal crystallization experiments using DSC and rheological measurements to elucidate the impact of the drug solid-state upon the crystallization kinetics. Tablets were prepared using various thermal histories (extrusion barrel temperature and injection mold temperatures). Polymer crystallinity and microstructure in the tablets was characterized via DSC and polarized optical microscopy. The polymer microstructure was altered by the various applied thermal histories. The differences in PEO crystallinity induced by the various mold temperatures did not affect the KETO dissolution from the tablets. On the other hand, MPT (20-40% w/w) dissolution from the PCL matrix when extruded at 80 degrees C and injection molded at 25 and 35 degrees C was significantly different due to the changes in the polymer microstructure. More perfect polymer crystals are obtained with higher mold temperatures, decreasing the drug diffusion rate through the PCL matrix. The results presented in this study imply that the injection mold temperature should be carefully controlled for sustained release formulations containing hydrophobic semi-crystalline polymers.

AB Peptides are therapeutic molecules that can treat selectively and efficiently a wide range of pathologies. However, their intrinsic properties cause their rapid degradation in the human gastrointestinal (GI) tract resulting in poor bioavailability after oral administration. Yet, their encapsulation in nanocarriers offers them protection from this harsh environment and increases their permeability across the epithelium border. In particular, Solid Lipid Nanoparticles (SLN) and Nanostructured Lipid Carriers (NLC) have proven to improve peptide oral bioavailability.
   This article details different techniques used to produce SLN and NLC with potential or effective peptide encapsulation. Basic principles of covalent and non-covalent lipidization are described and discussed as a prerequisite to improve hydrophilic peptide encapsulation in lipid-based nanosuspensions. The last part of this review provides the key evaluation techniques to assay SLN and NLC for peptide oral bioavailability enhancement. Methods to assess the protective effects of the carriers are described as well as the techniques to evaluate peptide release upon lipid digestion by lipases. Furthermore, this review suggests different techniques to measure permeability improvements and describes the main in vitro cell models associated.

AB The topical bioavailabilities of metronidazole from a commercially available 'reference' product (Rozex (R)) and two extemporaneous test formulations were compared. With the reference drug product, a full skin pharmacokinetic profile, in vivo in human volunteers (following a 6-h uptake and clearance over the subsequent 22 h), was obtained using an improved stratum corneum (SC) sampling procedure. Then, a two-time point SC sampling method enabled the bio(in)equivalence of the test formulations to Rozex (R) to be evaluated. One test formulation was shown to be bioequivalent to Rozex (R), both for uptake and clearance, whereas the other (more viscous and less spreadable) formulation was not. The delivery of metronidazole into the underlying viable epidermal tissue from Rozex (R) and from the equivalent test formulation was 2.5 to 3.5-fold higher than that from the inequivalent extemporaneous vehicle. The results highlight that the quantitative composition of a formulation, as well as its physical properties that influence events that take place at the vehicle-skin interface, can have a dramatic impact on the delivery of drug into the SC and subsequently to the viable skin layers below. The reproducible, sensitive and facile in vivo methodology employed may prove of particular value where regulatory approval of generic formulations lacks objective rigour.

AB The purpose of present investigation was to nano-encapsulate atypical antipsychotic such as Olanzapine in polymeric nanoparticles in order to explore the possibility of minimizing drug associated extrapyramidal adverse effects. The polymeric nanoparticulate systems were prepared using FDA approved polymer, polycaprolactone, by simple technique of nanoprecipitation using factorial design by DoE approach. The significant factors selected for the optimization during formulation development process were polymer content and surfactant concentration at three different levels (3(2) factorial design). The effect of selected significant factors were studied in depth on significant responses such as particle size and encapsulation efficiency. The optimized formulation was further surface modified with surfactant (polysorbate 80) so as to enhance the brain targeting efficiency of developed nanoparticles via endocytosis pathway. Furthermore, catalepsy was induced in rodent model and the designed formulations were investigated in comparison with pure drug solution for efficiency in decreasing extrapyramidal adverse effects. The results of in vitro characterization studies demonstrated a narrow size distributed nanoparticles (73.28 +/- 2.14 nm) with high stability indicating zetapotential (-32.46 +/- 1.15 mV) and high encapsulation efficiency (78.77 +/- 2.83%). In vitro release studies resulted in an extended release of atypical antipsychotic for 60 h from drug-loaded optimized nanoparticulate formulations. The catalepsy studies in rodent model demonstrated a significant decrease in extra pyramidal adverse effects as compared to the pure atypical antipsychotic. Thus, the designed antipsychotic loaded polymeric nanoparticulate system may be highly promising for the tremendous improvement of antipsychotic therapy with reduced adverse effects.

AB Background: In Luxembourg, a national Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination programme was introduced in 2008, targeting 12-17 year old girls offering a choice of bivalent or quadrivalent vaccine free of charge. In 2015, the programme was changed offering the bivalent vaccine only to 11-13 year old girls. The aim of this study was to evaluate the HPV vaccination coverage, to assess the impact of age target changes and compare vaccination coverage to other European countries.
   Methods: Anonymous HPV vaccination records consisting of individual vaccine doses obtained free of charge in pharmacies between 2008 and 2016 were extracted from the Luxembourgish Social Security database. Additional aggregate tables by nationality and municipality were analysed.
   Results: Of the target cohort of 39,610 girls born between 1991 and 2003 residing in Luxembourg, 24,550 (62.0%) subjects obtained at least one dose, 22,082 (55.7%) obtained at least two doses, and 17,197 (43.4%) obtained three doses of HPV vaccine. The mean age at first dose was 13.7 years during 200814 and 12.7 years in 2016 after the age target change. Coverage varied significantly by nationality (p < 0.0001): Portuguese (80%), former Yugoslays (74%), Luxembourgish (54%), Belgian (52%), German (47%), French (39%) and other, nationalities (51%). Coverage varied also by geographical region, with lower rates (<50%) noted in some Northern and Central areas of Luxembourg (range: 38% to 78%).
   Conclusion: Overall HPV vaccination coverage in Luxembourg is moderate and varied by nationality and region. The policy changes in 2015 did not have a substantial impact except lowering age at initiating vaccination. Options to improve coverage deserve further investigation. (C) 2018 The Author(s).

AB Pertussis remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality, particularly in infants and young children, and despite the availability of vaccines and pertinent national and international guidelines. The disease burden is more severe in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs), especially in the African continent. Pertussis is more prevalent among young infants in Africa. Poor or no pertussis surveillance, lack of disease awareness, diagnostic limitations, and competing health priorities are considered key contributory factors for this high pertussis burden in Africa. Most African countries use whole-cell pertussis (wP) vaccines, but coverage with three primary doses of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccines falls short of the World Health Organization's recommended goal of >90%. The Global Pertussis Initiative (GPI) works toward developing recommendations through systematic evaluation and prioritization of strategies to prevent pertussis-related infant and child deaths, as well as reducing global disease burden to acceptable national, regional, and local levels. For countries using wP vaccines, the GPI recommends continuing to use wP to improve primary and toddler booster vaccination coverage. Vaccination during pregnancy is the next priority when acellular pertussis (aP) vaccines and other resources are available that directly protect newborns too young to be vaccinated, followed by, in order of priority, booster doses in older children, adolescents, healthcare workers and finally, all adults. Improved surveillance should be a high priority for African LMICs assessing true disease burden and vaccine effectiveness to inform policy. More research is warranted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of wP and aP vaccines and strategies, and to determine their optimal use. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Herpes simplex virus is a prevalent pathogen of humans of various age groups. The fact that no prophylactic or therapeutic vaccine is currently available suggests a significant need to further investigate the immune mechanisms induced by the virus and various vaccine candidates. We previously generated an HSV-1 mutant strain, M3, with partial deletions in ul7, ul41 and LAT that produced an attenuated phenotype in mice. In the present study, we performed a comparative analysis to characterize the immune responses induced by M3 versus wild-type HSV-1 in a mouse model. Infection with wild-type HSV-1 triggered an inflammatory-dominated response and adaptive immunity suppression and was accompanied by severe pathological damage. In contrast, infection with M3 induced a systematic immune response involving full activation of both innate and adaptive immunity and was accompanied by no obvious pathological changes. Furthermore, the immune response induced by M3 protected mice from lethal challenge with wild -type strains of HSV-1 and restrained virus proliferation and impaired latency. These data are useful for further HSV-1 vaccine development using a mutant strain construction strategy. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The dengue virus (DENV) vaccines that are licensed or in clinical development consist of DENV serotype 1-4 tetravalent formulations given simultaneously and are not acquired sequentially like natural infections. It is unclear what effect this has on development of protective levels of immunity to all four serotypes. Serotype-specific neutralizing antibody (NAb) is considered the most relevant correlate of protection from dengue disease. Here we assessed levels of serotype-specific and cross-reactive NAb in immune sera from 10 subjects vaccinated with a live attenuated tetravalent DENV vaccine developed at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. The majority of subjects NAb responses to DENV-2 and DENV-4 were type-specific, while their NAb responses to DENV-1 and DENV-3 were primarily cross reactive. Vaccine virus RNAemia has been most frequently detected for DENV-2 and DENV-4 in vaccinated subjects, strongly suggesting that replication is important for eliciting serotype-specific immunity.

AB Objectives: The aims of this study were to (a) assess knowledge of official vaccination recommendations and attitudes towards vaccinations among adults and (b) examine their association with vaccination uptake among adults.
   Methods: This study was part of the HaBIDS study (Hygiene and Behaviour Infectious Diseases Survey), which is an online panel established in March 2014 in Lower Saxony, Germany with males and females aged between 15 and 69 years (n = 2379). Every few months, participants completed questionnaires on different aspects of infectious diseases. In September 2014, knowledge of vaccination recommendations, attitudes towards vaccinations and information on uptake of vaccinations in the last 10 years (practice) were collected using a knowledge-attitude-practice (KAP) questionnaire. Multiple correspondence analysis was applied to identify underlying structures in each KAP domain and fractional polynomial regression analysis to examine the associations of knowledge and attitudes with vaccination uptake.
   Results: Of the 2379 panel members, 1698 (71%) completed the KAP questionnaire on vaccinations. The majority of participants (80%) knew that the vaccine against diphtheria and tetanus should be administered every 10 years. Regarding other recommendations, the proportion of correct answers varied between 35% and 60%. 82% of participants agreed that adult vaccinations should be mandatory for selected groups such as health care workers and 40% stated that vaccinations should be mandatory for all adults. For the different vaccines, the odds of being unvaccinated were 1.5- to 5-times higher among participants with poor knowledge of vaccination recommendations compared to participants with good knowledge. Participants with negative attitudes towards vaccinations were also more likely to be unvaccinated.
   Conclusions: Efforts should be undertaken to improve knowledge of official vaccination recommendations in the general population and reduce common misconceptions about vaccinations. This information can be provided during general practitioner visits or through media campaigns. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Newborns are considered difficult to protect against infections shortly after birth, due to their ineffective immune system that shows quantitative and qualitative differences compared to adults. However, here we show that a single vaccination of mice at birth with a replication-deficient live vaccine Modified Vaccinia Ankara [MVA] efficiently induces antigen-specific B- and T-cells that fully protect against a lethal Ectromelia virus challenge. Protection was induced within 2 weeks and using genetically modified mice we show that this protection was mainly T-cell dependent. Persisting immunological T-cell memory and neutralizing antibodies were obtained with the single vaccination. Thus, MVA administered as early as at birth induced immediate and long-term protection against an otherwise fatal disease and appears attractive as a new generation smallpox vaccine that is effective also in children. Moreover, it may have the potential to serve as platform for childhood vaccines as indicated by measles specific T- and B-cell responses induced in newborn mice vaccinated with recombinant MVA expressing measles antigens.

AB In recent years, directed evolution has emerged as an efficient tool to develop and identify novel protein variants. Eimeria tenella microneme-2 (EtMIC2) is a promising vaccine candidate for use against E. tenella infection; however, it only yields partial protection. The present study aimed to improve the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of EtMIC2 through random mutagenesis. Mutagenesis gene libraries of EtMIC2 were generated using error -prone polymerase chain reaction (epPCR), and the corresponding variant proteins were displayed on the yeast cell surface. Variant EtMIC2 proteins with high immunogenicity were screened through fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) based on the affinity between polyclonal antibodies and antigens. Seven effective variant proteins were screened out and heterogeneously expressed in Escherichia colt as subunit vaccines. The protective efficacy of the variant proteins against E. tenella infections was then evaluated in chicken. Two variant proteins (1130 and 2119) displayed higher immunogenicity and protective efficacy than the wild-type EtMIC2 protein against E. tenella infections, increasing body weight gains and significantly decreasing lesion scores and fecal oocyst shedding, and increasing sIgA antibody production and lymphocyte proliferation. These variants displayed potential for use in the development of subunit vaccines for coccidiosis in chickens. The present results also indicate that directed evolution technology is useful for improving the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of parasite antigens. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Vaccination against hepatitis B virus (HBV) is recommended worldwide. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of infant hepatitis B vaccination and revaccination in 0- to 8-year -old children in the context of protective anti-HBs levels and cellular immune responses. Using a random questionnaire survey, 1695 pre-school children were recruited as research subjects during January 2015 to June 2017. Blood samples were obtained to measure HBV serological markers as well as peripheral immunocytes. The children were divided into non-, low- and hyper- responsive groups (NR, LR, and HR) based on the vaccination efficacy. Additionally, the effect of revaccination on the NR group was evaluated at 1 month after completion of the vaccination course. Among a total of 1695 children, 1591 (93.86%) were infants who were followed while undergoing their primary course of hepatitis B vaccination at the 0-1-6 month schedule, and 1249 (79.30%) of them developed antibodies against HBsAg (anti-HBs) titers greater than 10 IU/L. The results of immunocyte studies indicated that the CD8(+) T cells, CD44(+)CD45RO(+) T cells, CD8(+)CD45RA(+) T cells, and T follicular helper (Tfh) cells increased significantly in NR compared with HR. However, lymphocytes, CD4(+) T cells, and CD4(+)CD45RA(+) T cells in NR were lower than that in HR. 96 of the non-response cases showed seroprotection after revaccination among 103 cases. Therefore, most of the preschool children who received hepatitis B vaccine in infancy achieved significant seroprotection. Seroconversion rates of individuals revaccinated after initial vaccination failure were significantly higher than those after primary vaccination. Different vaccination efficacy groups showed significant changes in circulating immunocytes, which might be a factor affecting the recombinant HBV vaccine's immune effectiveness.

AB Yellow fever (YF) is an acute viral haemorrhagic disease caused by the yellow fever virus (YFV), which remains a potential threat to public health. The live-attenuated YF vaccine (17D strain) is a safe and highly effective measure against YF. However, increasing adverse events have been associated with YF vaccinations in recent years; thus, safer, alternative vaccines are needed. In this study, using the Japanese encephalitis live vaccine strain SA14-14-2 as a backbone, a novel chimeric virus was constructed by replacing the pre-membrane (prM) and envelope (E) genes with their YFV 17D counterparts. The chimeric virus exhibited a reduced growth rate and a much smaller plaque morphology than did either parental virus. Furthermore, the chimera was much less neurovirulent than was YF17D and protected mice that were challenged with a lethal dose of the YF virus. These results suggest that this chimera has potential as a novel attenuated YF vaccine. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: The effectiveness of influenza vaccine among nursery school children has not been systematically studied. We conducted a cohort study of children from 13 nursery schools in Suzhou, China, to estimate the effectiveness of influenza vaccine against laboratory-confirmed influenza during 2016-17.
   Methods: Children aged 36-72 months were chosen from 13 nursery schools from 3 District in Suzhou. The surveillance started 2 weeks after vaccination during October 2016-February 2017. Class teachers reported the names of students with IU (influenza-like illness) to study clinicians on each school day. Further, local physicians collected the student's nasopharyngeal swab or throat swab, either at a study clinic or at the child's home. The swabs were sent to the National Influenza Network Laboratory in Suzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention for influenza testing by RT-PCR.
   Result: A total of 4614 children were enrolled, of which 15 children (vaccinated: 2; unvaccinated: 13) were lost to follow-up. Of the remaining 4599 children, 558 swabs were collected. Among these swabs, 70 samples tested positive for influenza virus; 17 in the vaccinated group (B Victoria: 2; H3N2: 15) and 53 in the unvaccinated group (B Victoria: 14; A(H1N1)pdm09: 1; H3N2: 38). The overall influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) during the influenza season of 2016-2017 was 20.6%. The incidence of developing ILI symptoms and healthcare seeking behavior through clinical visits was significantly lower in vaccinated children than in the unvaccinated group.
   Conclusion: Influenza vaccine protection in vaccinated and unvaccinated children showed no statistical difference and the VE percentage varied for different virus subtypes. However, the incidence rate of developing ILI and healthcare seeking behavior was significant lower in the vaccinated group than in the unvaccinated children. larger studies are required to estimate the VE according to the influenza type, subtype, and lineage during influenza seasons in China in the future.

AB Tuberculosis (TB) infection affects a quarter of the global population resulting in a large burden of TB disease and mortality. The long-term control of TB requires vaccines with greater efficacy and durability than the current Mycobacterium bovis Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG). Pulmonary immunization may increase and prolong immunity at the site of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. We have investigated recombinant influenza A viruses (rIAVs) expressing the p25 CD4(+) T cell epitope of M. tuberculosis Ag85B(240-254) for single and sequential immunization against M. tuberculosis infection. Intranasal immunization with single dose of rIAV X31 (H3N2 strain) expressing the p25 epitope (X31-p25), induced p25-specific CD4(+) T cells and conferred protection against aerosol delivery of M. tuberculosis infection in the lungs. To enhance this effect, prime-boost immunization with hetero-subtypic rlAVs was examined. Sequential immunization with X31-p25 and a second rIAV, PR8 (H1N1 strain) expressing the same epitope (PR8-p25), increased the frequency of p25-specific IFN-gamma T cell responses and polyfunctional CD4(+) T cells producing IFN-gamma, IL-2, and TNF, compared to immunization with each rIAV alone. This combination resulted in protection against M. tuberculosis in both the lungs and spleen. Therefore, our study revealed that rIAV is not only an efficient vector to induce protective immunity in the lungs, but also has a potential use for sequential immunization with heterologous rIAV to boost the immunogenicity and improve the protection against M. tuberculosis.

AB Background: Persons from the United States who travel to developing countries are at substantial risk for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Hepatitis B vaccine has been recommended for adults at increased risk for infection, including travelers to high or intermediate hepatitis B endemic countries.
   Purpose: To assess hepatitis B vaccination coverage among adults >= 18 years traveling to a country of high or intermediate endemicity from the United States.
   Methods: Data from the 2015 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) were analyzed to determine hepatitis B vaccination coverage (>= 1 dose) and series completion (>= 3 doses) among persons aged >= 18 years who reported traveling to a country of high or intermediate hepatitis B endemicity. Multivariable logistic regression and predictive marginal analyses were conducted to identify factors independently associated with hepatitis B vaccination.
   Results: In 2015, hepatitis B vaccination coverage (>= 1 dose) among adults aged >= 18 years who reported traveling to high or intermediate hepatitis B endemic countries was 38.6%, significantly higher compared with 25.9% among non-travelers. Series completion (>= 3 doses) was 31.7% and 21.2%, respectively (P < 0.05). On multivariable analysis among all respondents, travel status was significantly associated with hepatitis B vaccination coverage and series completion. Other characteristics independently associated with vaccination (>= 1 dose, and >= 3 doses) among travelers included age, race/ethnicity, educational level, duration of U.S. residence, number of physician contacts in the past year, status of ever being tested for HIV, and healthcare personnel status.
   Conclusions: Although travel to a country of high or intermediate hepatitis B endemicity was associated with higher likelihood of hepatitis B vaccination, hepatitis B vaccination coverage was low among adult travelers to these areas. Healthcare providers should ask their patients about travel plans and recommend and offer travel related vaccinations to their patients or refer them to alternate sites for vaccination.

AB Mucosal but not parenteral vaccination with whole Leishmania amazonensis promastigotes antigens (LaAg) is known to increase host resistance to infection by an as yet unknown immune mechanism. Since early immune responses are critical for infection establishment, in the present study the differential responses elicited by subcutaneous (s.c.) and intranasal (i.n.) vaccination with LaAg were investigated during the initial stages of infection. For that, BALB/c mice were given two LaAg doses by in. or s.c. route prior to L. amazonensis infection in the footpad. It was found that mucosal vaccination prevented both T helper (Th) 2-associated cutaneous hypersensitivity and local interleukin (IL)-4 production in the first days after parasite challenge in the footpad. That was accompanied by increased Th1 (T-bet and IL-12) and T-reg (Foxp3 and IL-10) transcription factor and cytokine expression in the lesion draining lymph nodes. In contrast, s.c. LaAg predominantly led to higher Th2 (GATA3) and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta expression. Prior i.n. vaccination was able to prevent the disease-exacerbating effect of s.c. vaccination. Although both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells were transiently increased in the cervical lymph nodes (cLN), the numbers of CD4(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T (T-reg) cells decreased within 48 h of i.n. vaccination as compared to non-vaccinated mice. Adoptive transfer of such cLN cells conferred increased resistance to infected mice, mimicking the effect of i.n. vaccination. Altogether, these data indicate that i.n. vaccination with LaAg may prevent early peripheral expansion of detrimental cells normally elicited by active infection or s.c. vaccination, thus allowing full expansion of protective responses.

AB Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG) is an important pathogen of poultry worldwide that causes chronic respiratory disease (CRD) in chickens and infectious sinusitis in turkeys. Vaxsafe MG (strain ts-11) is a live attenuated temperature sensitive vaccine that has been proven to be effective in controlling CRD in chickens, but it is not efficacious in turkeys. The gapA gene, which encodes a mature cytadhesin protein with a molecular weight of approximately 105 kDa, is not expressed in strain ts-11 because a 20 base pair reiterated sequence introduces a frame shift and causes premature truncation of the translated peptide. A GapA positive clone, MG ts-304, isolated from strain ts-11 has been shown to have enhanced efficacy in chickens. Here we describe studies we conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of the MG ts-304 vaccine candidate in turkeys. We found that MG ts-304 was able to colonise the trachea of 3-week-old turkeys and was safe, even at a tenfold overdose, inducing no adverse clinical signs of respiratory disease or significant gross lesions in the respiratory tract (air sacs or trachea), and was poorly transmissible to in-contact birds. We also showed that it was efficacious when administered to 3-week-old turkeys, inducing protective immunity against challenge with the M. gallisepticum wild-type strain Ap3AS. MG ts-304 is therefore a promising live attenuated vaccine candidate for use in turkeys. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background and objectives: Vaccination with Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine is recommended for 11-12 years-old, but uptake is suboptimal. Current messaging focuses on HPV infection transmission and prevention. Parents and providers are often uncomfortable discussing sexual practices of adolescents, contributing to the delay/refusal of vaccine. We created a cervical cancer-salient message encouraging HPV vaccination, emphasizing disease salience and disease threat, while promoting self-efficacy. We hypothesized this message would have greater effects on vaccine confidence and intent to vaccinate compared to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and non-vaccine control messages.
   Methods: A 3-arm randomized trial was conducted. Parents of girls aged 9-17 were eligible for the study. We measured participants' vaccine confidence and intent to vaccinate at baseline and post intervention message. Recruitment and surveys were administered online through Amazon Mechanical Turk.
   Results: 762 participants completed both surveys. We saw modest increases in vaccine confidence when comparing cervical cancer arm and control arm, and CDC arm and control arm; estimates were not statistically significant. The odds of reporting intent to vaccinate among the cervical cancer message arm were 1.13 times the odds of reporting intent to vaccinate in the control arm (95% CI: 0.30. 4.29). Intent to vaccinate was also not statistically significantly different between CDC message arm and control arm (OR = 1.25, 95%CI: 0.66, 2.37).
   Conclusion: Neither message had effect on intent to vaccinate, highlighting need for research to identify successful messaging strategies for HPV. Exploratory analyses suggest among parents with 'Low' vaccine confidence at baseline, the cervical cancer framed message may be more effective in changing intention than the CDC message or non-vaccine control. Future work should target groups with 'Low' or 'Medium' vaccine confidence at baseline - they may be more amenable to change, and more receptive to disease-salient messaging. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Amorphous powders are thermodynamically unstable, significantly impacting the processing, storage and performance of a product. Therefore, stabilization of the amorphous contents is in demand. In this study, disodium cromoglycate (DSCG) powder was chosen as a model drug because it is amorphous and highly hygroscopic after spray drying. Sodium stearate (NaSt) was co-spray dried with DSCG at various concentrations (10, 50 and 90% w/w) to investigate its effect against moisture-induced deterioration on the in vitro aerosolization performance of DSCG. Particle size distribution and morphology were measured by laser diffraction and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Physicochemical properties of the powders were analysed by X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) and dynamic vapour sorption (DVS). Particle surface chemistry was analysed by the time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS). In vitro dissolution behaviours of the spray-dried (SD) powders were tested by the Franz cell apparatus. In vitro aerosolization performance of SD formulations stored at different relative humidity (RH) was evaluated by a multi-stage liquid impinger (MSLI), using an Osmohaler (R) at 100 L/min. Results showed that adding NaSt in the formulation not only increased the aerosolization performance of DSCG significantly, but also effectively reduced the deleterious impact of moisture. No significant difference was found in the fine particle fraction (FPF) of formulations containing NaSt before and after storage at both 60% and 75% RH for one week. However, after one month storage at 75% RH, SD formulation containing 10% NaSt showed a reduction in FPF, while formulations containing 50% or 90% NaSt showed no change. The underlying mechanism was that NaSt increased the crystallinity of the powders and its presence on the particle surface reduced particle aggregations and cohesiveness. However, NaSt at high concentration could reduce dissolution rate, which needs to be taken into consideration.

TI Co-spray drying of hygroscopic kanamycin with the hydrophobic drug

AB High dose delivery of drugs to the lung using a dry powder inhaler (DPI) is an emerging approach to combat drug-resistant local infections. To achieve this, highly aerosolizable powders are required. We hypothesized that co-spray-drying kanamycin, a hydrophilic hygroscopic antibiotic, with rifampicin, a hydrophobic antibiotic, would produce inhalable particles with surfaces enriched in rifampicin. Such particles would have higher aerosolization than kanamycin alone, and minimise the mass of powder for inhalation avoiding use of non-active excipients.
   Kanamycin was co-spray-dried with rifampicin using a Buchi Mini Spray-dryer. All powders were inhalable in size (1.1-5.9 mu m) and noncrystalline. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) showed the surface of the combination powder was enriched with rifampicin. In vitro aerosolization (fine particle fraction) determined by next generation impactor (NGI), dramatically improved from 29.5 +/- 0.2% (kanamycin-only) to 78.2 +/- 1.3% (kanamycin-rifampicin combination). The combination powder was flake-shaped in morphology, stable at 15% and 53% RH and 25 +/- 2 degrees C during one-month storage in an open Petri dish, and non-toxic (up to 50 mu g/mL) to human alveolar and bronchial cell-lines.
   Surface enrichment of kanamycin by hydrophobic rifampicin improves aerosolization, which may help to combat drug-resistant local infections by facilitating high dose delivery to deep lung.

AB Camptothecin (CPT) has a potent and broad-spectrum anti-tumor activity but its clinical use is limited due to its poor water solubility, stability at physiological conditions and toxicity. The aim of our study was to evaluate bicephalous heterolipid E1E for enhancing the solubility and stability of CPT through the development of a self-microemulsifying drug delivery system (SMEDDS). The solubility of CPT in heterolipid E1E was found to be 82 and 5.86 folds higher than oleic acid and ethyl oleate respectively. Molecular dynamic simulation (MDS) studies revealed that stability of hydrogen bonding between CPT with E1E contributed to solubility enhancement of CPT. SMEDDS of CPT with heterolipid E1E as an oil phase was prepared and evaluated for drug loading, droplet size, morphology, thermodynamic and long-term stability studies as per ICH guidelines. The product, CPTSMEDDS Fc showed 1.75 mg CPT loading per 1 g of SMEDDS having a droplet size of 20.93 +/- 0.41 nm. CPTSMEDDS Fc was found to be stable, equipotent as compared to doxorubicin and had low toxicity in HeLa, MCF-7, and HL-60 cell lines. These results signify that the delivery system, CPT-SMEDDS Fc could be a very good candidate to be considered for preclinical and clinical investigations.

TI Intestinal absorption and activation of decitabine amino acid ester

AB Decitabine (DAC), a potent DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor, has a limited oral bioavailability. Its 5'-amino acid ester prodrugs could improve its oral delivery but the specific absorption mechanism is not yet fully understood. The aim of this present study was to investigate the in vivo absorption and activation mechanism of these prodrugs using in situ intestinal perfusion and pharmacokinetics studies in rats. Although PEPT1 transporter is pH dependent, there appeared to be no proton cotransport in the perfusion experiment with a preferable transport at pH 7.4 rather than pH 6.5. This suggested that the transport was mostly dependent on the dissociated state of the prodrugs and the proton gradient might play only a limited role. In pH 7.4 HEPES buffer, an increase in P-eff was observed for L-val-DAC, D-val-DAC, L-phe-DAC and L-trp-DAC (2.89-fold, 1.2-fold, 2.73-fold, and 1.90-fold, respectively), compared with the parent drug. When co-perfusing the prodrug with Glysar, a known substrate of PEPT1, the permeabilities of the prodrugs were significantly inhibited compared with the control. To further investigate the absorption of the prodrugs, L-val-DAC was selected and found to be concentration-dependent and saturable, suggesting a carrier-mediated process (intrinsic K-m: 7.80 +/- 2.61 mM) along with passive transport. Determination of drug in intestinal homogenate after perfusion further confirmed that the metabolic activation mainly involved an intestinal first-pass effect. In a pharmacokinetic evaluation, the oral bioavailability of L-val-DAC, L-phe-DAC and L-trp-DAC were nearly 1.74-fold, 1.69-fold and 1.49-fold greater than that of DAC. The differences in membrane permeability and oral bioavailability might be due to the different stability in the intestinal lumen and the distinct PEPT1 affinity which is mainly caused by the stereochemistry, hydrophobicity and steric hindrance of the side chains. In summary, the detailed investigation of the absorption mechanism by in vivo intestinal perfusion and pharmacokinetic studies showed that the prodrugs of DAC exhibited excellent permeability and oral bioavailability, which might be attributed to a hybrid (partly PEPT1-mediated and partly passive) transport mode and a rapid activation process in enterocytes.

AB Aim: Development of mucoadhesive self-emulsifying drug delivery systems (SEDDS) providing a prolonged ocular residence time for poorly soluble active pharmaceutical ingredient.
   Methods: L-Cysteine was covalently linked to 6-mercaptonicotinamide. The obtained ligand, Cysteine-6-mercaptonicotinamide (Cys-6-MNA) was attached to Eudragit (R) L100-55 via a carbodiimide mediated amide bond formation. The resulting entirely S-protected thiolated Eudragit (R) L100-55 was characterized regarding the degree of modification as well as stability toward oxidation in the presence of strong oxidizing agent (H2O2). The Sprotected thiolated Eudragit (R) L100-55 was incorporated into SEDDS via hydrophobic ion pairing with benzalkonium chloride (BAK) in a concentration of 2% (m/m). S-protected thiolated Eudragit (R) L100-55-BAK ion pair SEDDS (S-protected thiolated EU-BAK SEDDS) were characterized regarding their physicochemical and mucoadhesive properties. Econazole nitrate (EN) was incorporated into SEDDS in concentration of 1% (m/m) and in vitro drug release was assessed. Furthermore, toxicity study was performed on procine corneas via resazurin assay.
   Results: The entirely S-protected thiolated Eudragit (R) L100-55 exhibited 282 +/- 78.25 mu mol of MNA per gram of polymer. Ellman's test confirmed no free thiol groups and stability study showed no significant increase in dynamic viscosity overtime. The droplet size of developed SEDDS in simulated lacrimal fluid was below 100 nm with polydispersity index below 0.3. S-protected thiolated EU-BAK SEDDS exhibited 2.5-fold higher mucoadhesive properties than blank SEDDS on ocular mucosa. S-protected thiolated EU-BAK SEDDS showed sustained EN release over period of 8 h and no pronounced corneal toxicity in 0.5% (m/v) concentration.
   Conclusion: Accordingly, these mucoadhesive SEDDS can be considered as promising ocular delivery system for EN.

AB In this explorative study of the novel cationic lipid OO4 in two different formulations the complex formation with DNA, the biopharmaceutical stability of the lipid/DNA complexes in physiological media, and the transfection efficiency were analysed. We investigated liposomes composed of two binary mixtures of OO4 with either DOPE or DPPE as co-lipids in the molar ratio of 1:3. These formulations were compared with regard to their ability to bind the DNA using gel retardation electrophoresis, ethidium bromide exclusion and zeta potential measurements. Colloidal stability of the lipoplexes in foetal bovine serum (FBS) and the protective effect against degradation by endonucleases were studied. Furthermore, the influence of different salt concentrations on the complex formation with DNA was examined. The DOPE mixture was markedly superior compared to the DPPE mixture. Finally, haemocompatibility studies and gene silencing experiments were performed on OO4:DOPE 1:3 (n:n). The experiments demonstrate that the lipoplex formulation OO4: DOPE 1:3 (n:n) at N/P 4 is a promising candidate for systemic application because of the high colloidal stability in serum without PEGylated lipids, high transfection efficiency, superior resistance against nucleases, reproducible complexation independent of ionic effects, and haemocompatibility.

AB A limitation in the systemic uptake of many inhalable drugs is the restricted permeation through the pulmonary epithelial layer barrier. One strategy to bypass the epithelial layer when delivering non-permeable drugs is to alter the paracellular transport, allowing the uptake of drugs into the systemic circulation. In this study, the potential of sodium decanoate (Na dec), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) as absorption enhancers has been investigated to increase pulmonary paracellular permeability by modulating epithelial cells' tight junctions. By incorporating Na dec, DHA and EPA, separately, into a nebulising formulation, the aim was to enhance the absorption of a fluorescent marker (flu-Na, used as model drug) across pulmonary epithelial cells (Calu-3).
   Results indicate that the aerosol performance of all the nebulizing formulations containing absorption enhancers was significantly better than control. Furthermore, the in vitro cell assays demonstrated a significant increase in paracellular transport of the fluorescent marker with Na dec and DHA formulations. This finding supports the potential use of DHA and Na dec to enhance epithelial transport of poorly permeable drugs delivered via inhalation.

AB Enalapril is an off-patent angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor for which no paediatric age-appropriate formulation is commercially available in Europe, and enalapril maleate (EM) orodispersible minitablets (ODMTs) have previously been formulated within the LENA (labelling enalapril from neonates to adolescents) project. In this study, a dilution method has been developed by dispersing the lowest dose strength ODMTs to enable flexible and precise EM dosing during the dose titration phase of the therapy. Furthermore, the physicochemical stability of the ODMTs has been investigated in child-friendly beverages and the administration of ODMTs via nasogastric tubes (NGT) of different sizes and materials has been evaluated. The results for the ODMT dilution procedure reveal that dispersion within an oral syringe is preferred over dispersion in a separate container, leading to flexible and precise dosing down to 0.025 mg EM. Although ODMTs were stable in the beverages over the investigated time period, dispersion in tap water only is recommended due to prolonged disintegration times within the other beverages. Dispersed ODMTs can be administered through NGTs of CH5. Almost no adsoprtion of EM on silicone, polyurethane or polyvinyl chloride could be observed. The ODMT concept together with the investigated dispersion method enables the safe administration of EM for all paediatric subpopulations from new-borns to adolescents.

AB The aim of this paper was to study relationships between the content of fine particles and the powder mechanics of binary adhesive mixtures and link these relationships to the blend state. Mixtures with increasing amounts of fine particles (increasing surface coverage ratios (SCR)) were prepared using Lactopress SD as carrier and micro particles of lactose as fines (2.7 mu m). Indicators of unsettled bulk density, compressibility and flowability were derived and the blend state was visually examined by imaging. The powder properties studied showed relationships to the SCR characterised by stages. At low SCR, the fine particles predominantly gathered in cavities of the carriers, giving increased bulk density and unchanged or improved flow. Thereafter, increased SCR gave a deposition of particles at the enveloped carrier surface with a gradually more irregular adhesion layer leading to a reduced bulk density and a step-wise reduced flowability. The mechanics of the mixtures at a certain stage were dependent on the structure and the dynamics of the adhesion layer and transitions between the stages were controlled by the evolution of the adhesion layer. It is advisable to use techniques based on different types of flow in order to comprehensively study the mechanics of adhesive mixtures.

AB Radiotherapy is a life-saving treatment for head and neck cancers, but almost 100% of patients develop dry mouth (xerostomia) because of radiation-induced damage to their salivary glands. Patients with xerostomia suffer symptoms that severely affect their health as well as physical, social and emotional aspects of their life. The current management of xerostomia is the application of saliva substitutes or systemic delivery of saliva-stimulating cholinergic agents, including pilocarpine, cevimeline or bethanechol tablets. It is almost impossible for substitutes to replicate all the functional and sensory facets of natural saliva. Salivary stimulants are a better treatment option than saliva substitutes as the former induce the secretion of natural saliva from undamaged glands; typically, these are the minor salivary glands. However, patients taking cholinergic agents systemically experience pharmacology-related side effects including sweating, excessive lacrimation and gastrointestinal tract distresses. Local delivery direct to the buccal mucosa has the potential to provide rapid onset of drug action, i.e. activation of minor salivary glands within the buccal mucosa, while sparing systemic drug exposure and off-target effects. This critical review of the technologies for the local delivery of saliva-stimulating agents includes oral disintegrating tablets (ODTs), oral disintegrating films, medicated chewing gums and implantable drug delivery devices. Our analysis makes a strong case for the development of ODTs for the buccal delivery of cholinergic agents: these must be patient-friendly delivery platforms with variable loading capacities that release the drug rapidly in fluid volumes typical of residual saliva in xerostomia (0.05-0.1 mL).

AB Sparfloxacin (SPFX) is a broad spectrum antibiotic which inhibits bacterial DNA gyrase enzyme activity. However, photodegradation in the presence of UVA limits its antibacterial activity and induces phototoxicity. Thus, to encounter this problem, we have developed poly d,l-lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) loaded SPFX nanoparticles. Here, we have performed a comparative antibacterial activity of SPFX and its nanoparticles (NPs) through molecular docking and plate sensitivity assay. Under environmental UVA exposure, photoexcited SPFX significantly generates ROS, DNA damage and mitochondrial mediated cell death in comparison to PLGA-SPFXNPs (nano SPFX) in human skin cell line (HaCaT). In presence of UVA, bulk SPFX induced cell cycle arrest with appearance of sub-G1 peak showing apoptosis while nano SPFX did not show any change. SPFX triggered apoptosis via alteration in membrane integrity of mitochondria and lysosome in comparison to PLGA-SPFX-NPs. Involvement of mitochondrial mediated cell death was confirmed by down-regulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and procaspase-3 and upregulation of pro-apoptotic Bax, cytochrome-c and caspase-3 proteins expression. Specific caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-FMK showed involvement of caspase cascade pathway in apoptosis. Our finding suggests that controlled release of SPFX from PLGA-SPFX-NPs can reduce its side effects and enhance its antibacterial activity. Thus, nanotization of fluoroquinolones will be a significant step to reduce the problem of resistance and phototoxicity of this group.

AB Solid dispersions (SDs) hold a proven potential in formulating poorly water-soluble drugs. The present paper investigates the interfacial phenomena associated with the bulk powder flow, water sorption, wetting and dissolution of the SDs prepared by a modified melt and quench-cooling (QC) method. Poorly water-soluble indomethacin (IND) was QC molten with solubilizing graft copolymer (Soluplus (R)) or polyol sugar alcohol (xylitol, XYL). The interfacial interactions of SDs with air/water were found to be reliant on the type (amorphous/crystalline) and amount of the carrier material used. The final SDs were composed of fused agglomerates (SOL) or large jagged particles (XYL) with good wetting and powder flow properties. The initial dissolution of IND was accelerated by both carrier materials studied. The QC molten SDs with amorphous Soluplus (R) significantly improved the dissolution rate of IND at pH 6.8 (79.9 +/- 0.2% at 30 min) compared to that of pure crystalline drug. The substantial improvement in the dissolution rate of IND was in connection with the amorphous state of the drug being stabilized by Soluplus (R) in the QC molten SDs. However, it is evident that a strong H-bond formation between the components in some regions of the QC molten SDs can limit the dissolution of IND. The QC molten two-phase SDs with a polyol carrier (XYL) showed rapid and continuous drug release without reaching a plateau.

AB This study sought to evaluate the antitumor effects of and elucidate the mechanisms underlying (-)-epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate (EGCG) and polyethyleneglycol (PEG)-modified liposomes. EGCG functions as a target ligand of the 67-kDa laminin receptor (67LR), which is expressed on high-grade tumor cells. An EGCG derivative was synthesized for binding to the end of PEG. Doxorubicin (DOX)-loaded EGCG-PEG-modified liposome (EPL) significantly decreased tumor size in mice bearing high 67LR-high-expressing tumors. Caspase-3 activity, which indicates induction of apoptosis, was also elevated only in the EPL group. The importance of PEG for the antitumor effects of EGCG was noted, as soluble EGCG did not accumulate at a sufficient concentration to exert an apoptotic effect. Moreover, EPL significantly increased caspase-8 activity, suggesting that EPL-induced apoptosis occurred due to caspase-8 activity induced following the binding of EGCG to 67LR as a cell-death ligand. In conclusion, EPL appear to have superior antitumor activity against high 67LR-expressing tumor cells, as the liposomes had dual effects, namely antitumor effects due to the loaded DOX and apoptosis induced by the bound EGCG.

AB Bevacizumab-loaded nanoparticles (B-NP) were prepared by a desolvation process followed by freeze-drying, without any chemical, physical or enzymatic cross-linkage. Compared with typical HSA nanoparticles crosslinked with glutaraldehyde (B-NP-GLU), B-NP displayed a significantly higher mean size (310 nm vs. 180 nm) and a lower negative zeta potential (-15 mV vs. -36 mV). On the contrary, B-NP displayed a high payload of approximately 13% when measured by a specific ELISA, whereas B-NP-GLU presented a very low bevacizumab loading (0.1 mu g/mg). These results could be related to the inactivation of bevacizumab after reacting with glutaraldehyde. From B-NP, bevacizumab was released following an initial burst effect, proceeded by a continuous release of bevacizumab at a rate of 6 mu g/h. Cytotoxicity studies in ARPE cells were carried out at a single dose up to 72 h and with repeated doses over a 5-day period. Neither bevacizumab nor B-NP altered cell viability even when repeated doses were used. Finally, B-NP were labeled with Tc-99m and administered as eye drops in rats. Tc-99m-B-NP remained in the eye for at least 4 h while Tc-99m-HSA was rapidly drained from the administration point. In summary, HSA nanoparticles may be an appropriate candidate for ocular delivery of bevacizumab.

AB Potential positive effects of flavonol quercetin on humans were suggested by many studies. However, it is not clear if these effects are mediated by quercetin or its metabolites. The in vivo confirmation of quercetin effects is largely hindered by its low water solubility and thus impossibility to test directly its impact. Therefore, a solid dispersion of quercetin with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) was developed to prepare an injectable formulation of water-soluble quercetin. The optimized formulation provided a 20,000-fold increase in quercetin solubility. This formulation was tested on conventional and spontaneously hypertensive rats; it lowered their blood pressure in both short-and long-term basis. Pharmacokinetic data are also provided. This study reports for the first time an injectable water-soluble formulation of quercetin suitable for confirmation of its vascular effect in vivo.

AB Both, formulation parameters and the presence of liquid-air interfaces are known to affect the aggregation of protein drugs. In this study, the impact of pH on the liquid-air interfacial behavior of three proteins, a polyclonal and two monoclonal antibodies (IgG, mAB(1) and mAB(2)) was investigated using different surface sensitive methods. Equilibrium surface pressure values revealed only a minor impact of pH. Infrared Reflectance Absorbance Spectroscopy (IRRAS) proved not only the presence of the proteins at the interface but also showed that the secondary structure was not considerably affected by the adsorption to the interface independent of pH between pH 3 and 9. Additionally, the physical resistance of the film as determined by the interfacial compressibility in a Langmuir trough was not affected by pH. Compression of the interfacial film caused the formation of telescoped areas which were no longer present after decompression at all pH values as investigated by underwater Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). Brewster Angle Microscopy (BAM) showed some slight changes in the film reflectivity depending on pH, indicating changes in the interfacial film thickness. IRRAS experiments at different angles of incidence as well as section analysis of AFM images proved not only that the film thickness increased upon compression, but also that the interfacial film is thinner at pH 4 than at pH 9. Continuous compression and decompression of the protein film resulted in particle formation with increasing numbers of particles at higher pH value as detected by Light Obscuration (LO) and Micro-Flow Imaging (MFI). The use of different surface sensitive methods provides expedient information on how liquid-air interfacial events are affected by formulation pH. These findings enable a better understanding of not only the events and processes happening at the interface but can also be directly linked to the interface-related formation of particles.

ID TABLETS
AB ater-soluble polymers with high viscosity are frequently used in the design of sustained-release formulations of poorly water-soluble drugs to enable complete release of the drug in the gastrointestinal tract. Tablets containing matrix granules with a water-soluble polymer are preferred because tablets are easier to handle and the multiple drug-release units of the matrix granules decreases the influences of the physiological environment on the drug. However, matrix granules with a particle size of over 800 mu m sometimes cause a content uniformity problem in the tableting process because of the large particle size. An effective method of manufacturing controlled-release matrix granules with a smaller particle size is desired. The aim of this study was to develop tablets containing matrix granules with a smaller size and good controlled-release properties, using phenytoin as a model poorly water-soluble drug. We adapted the recently developed hollow spherical granule granulation technology, using water-soluble polymers with different viscosities. The prepared granules had an average particle size of 300 mu m and sharp particle size distribution (relative width: 0.52-0.64). The values for the particle strength of the granules were 1.86-1.97 N/mm(2), and the dissolution profiles of the granules were not affected by the tableting process. The dissolution profiles and the blood concentration levels of drug released from the granules depended on the viscosity of the polymer contained in the granules. We succeeded in developing the desired controlled-release granules, and this study should be valuable in the development of sustained-release formulations of poorly water-soluble drugs.

AB Form changes during drug product processing can be a risk to the final product quality in terms of chemical stability and bioavailability. In this study, online Raman spectroscopy was used to monitor the form changes in real time during high shear wet granulation of Compound A, a highly soluble drug present at a high drug load in an extended release formulation. The effect of water content, temperature, wet massing time and drying technique on the degree of drug transformation were examined. A designed set of calibration standards were employed to develop quantitative partial least square regression models to predict the concentration of each drug form during both wet granulation and the drying process. Throughout all our experiments we observed complex changes of the drug form during granulation, manifest as conversions between the initial non-solvated form of Compound A, the hemi-hydrate form and the "apparent" amorphous form (dissolved drug). The online Raman data demonstrate that the non-solvated form converts to an "apparent" amorphous form (dissolved drug) due to drug dissolution with no appearance of the hemi-hydrate form during water addition stage. The extent of conversion of the non-solvated form was governed by the amount of water added and the rate of conversion was accelerated at higher temperatures. Interestingly, in the wet massing zone, the formation of the hemi-hydrate form was observed at a rate equivalent to the rate of depletion of the non-solvated form with no change in the level of the "apparent amorphous" form generated. The level of hemi-hydrate increased with an increase in wet massing time. The drying process had a significant effect on the proportion of each form. During tray drying, changes in drug form continued for hours. In contrast fluid bed drying appeared to lock the final proportions of drug form product attained during granulation, with comparatively small changes observed during drying. In conclusion, it was possible to simultaneously monitor the three forms in real time during wet granulation and drying using online Raman spectroscopy. The results regarding the effect of process parameters on the degree of transformation are critical for designing a robust process that ensures a consistent form in the final drug product.

AB Since adulteration can have serious consequences on human health, it affects market growth by destroying consumer confidence. Therefore, authentication of food is important for food processors, retailers and consumers, but also for regulatory authorities. However, a complex nature of food and an increase in types of adulterants make their detection difficult, so that food authentication often poses a challenge. This review focuses on analytical approaches to authentication of food of animal origin, with an emphasis put on determination of specific ingredients, geographical origin and adulteration by virtue of substitution. This review highlights a current overview of the application of target approaches in cases when the compound of interest is known and non-target approaches for screening issues. Papers cited herein mainly concern milk, cheese, meat and honey. Moreover, advantages, disadvantages as well as challenges regarding the use of both approaches in official food control but also in food industry are investigated.

AB A multiple loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method was developed to detect cow and goat milk in the field using a portable fluorescence device. For rapid on-site detection, this duplex LAMP assay was used in combination with direct amplification, without DNA extraction. The cow-and goat-specific LAMP primer sets were designed based on the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene, and showed specificity against 13 other animal species in the reactions. The sensitivity of the duplex LAMP assay for cow and goat was 0.1 and 1 pg, respectively. The detection limit for both target species in milk mixtures was 2%. This assay successfully amplified and identified the two target species in 24 samples of commercial milk and yogurt products, with 30 min sampling-to-result analysis time. Therefore, this direct duplex real-time LAMP assay is useful for on-site simultaneous detection of cow and goat milk in commercial products, a capability needed to confirm accurate labeling.

AB The determination of the botanical/geographical origin of honey provides assurance of the product's quality. In the present work, honeys from different ecoregions of Argentina were analysed, and the possible link between the complete pollen profile of honey samples and their volatile composition was evaluated by multivariate statistical tools. A total of 110 volatile compounds were found and semiquantified in honey samples. Redundancy analysis showed significant correlations between the volatile profile of honeys and their production region (P = .0002). According to the present results, 3,8-p-menthatriene; cyclopropylidenemethylbenzene; 1,1,6-trimethyl-1,2-dihydronaphthalene; 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene; alpha-pinene; isopropyl 2-methylbutanoate; cymene; 2,6-dimethyl-1,6-octadiene; 3-methyloctane; 1-(1,4-dimethyl-3-cyclohexen-1-yl)ethanone; terpinolene; ethyl 2-phenylacetate; naphthalene and 7 unknown compounds could be used to classify Argentinean honeys according to their geographical origin with a prediction success of 96%. Moreover, it could be concluded that honeys with Eucalyptus sp., Aristotelia chilensis and T. Baccharis pollen types presented some characteristic volatile compounds which could be used as floral markers.

AB Oil extraction from green coffee seeds generates residual mass that is discarded by agribusiness and has not been previously studied. Bioactive secondary metabolites in coffee include antioxidant phenolic compounds, such as chlorogenic acids. Coffee seeds also contain caffeine, a pharmaceutically important methylxanthine. Here, we report the chemical profile, antioxidant activity, and cytotoxicity of hydroethanolic extracts of green Coffea arabica L. seed residue. The extracts of the green seeds and the residue have similar chemical profiles, containing the phenolic compounds chlorogenic acid and caffeine. Five monoacyl and three diacyl esters of trans-cinnamic acids and quinic acid were identified by ultra-performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization-quadruple time of flight mass spectrometry. The residue extract showed antioxidant potential in DPPH, ABTS, and pyranine assays and low cytotoxicity.

AB The aim of this work was to study the effect of heat and moisture treatment (HMT) on carotenoids, phenolic content and antioxidant capacity of ground, orange maize. Total carotenoid content (TCC) of untreated sample (53.39 mg/kg) was 2.2 times higher than measured in treated orange maize f (24.61 mg/kg). The rates of degradation with HMT were in the following order: beta-carotene > beta-cryptoxanthin > zeaxanthin > lutein. There was a significant interaction between longer heating time and higher moisture content on carotenoid degradation (p < .05). Total phenolic content (TPC) in raw sample (1664.74 mg/kg) was two-fold higher than in treated orange maize (827.89 mg/kg). Ferulic acid was the most abundant and stable phenolic acid in raw and treated orange maize. The antioxidant capacity of orange maize was higher in methanol than in butanol extracts. The highest correlation (0.924) was observed between TPC and ABTS. + scavenging capacity of methanol extracts.

AB In this study, we applied a next generation sequencing (NGS) technology (Ion Torrent) for species identification based on three mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) regions amplified on DNA extracted from dairy products. Sequencing reads derived from three libraries, obtained from artificial DNA pools or from pooled amplicons, were used to test the method. Then, sequencing results from five libraries obtained from two mixed goat and cow milk samples, one buffalo mozzarella cheese, one goat crescenza cheese and one artisanal cured ricotta cheese, were able to detect all expected species in addition to undeclared species in a few of them. Mining generated reads it was possible to identify different dairy species mitotypes and the presence of human DNA that could constitute a potential marker to monitor the hygienic level of dairy products. Overall results demonstrated the usefulness of NGS for species identification in food products and its possible application for food authentication.

DE Sugarcane; Raw sugar; Colourants; Total starch method; Method comparison
ID INDUSTRY; COLOR
AB Industrial starch methods in the sugar industry are affected by sugarcane-and processing-derived colourants, and it was presumed that these methods are mathematically equatable. Using the USDA Starch Research method as a reference and factory raw sugars, the impact of colourants on the accuracy, precision, limits of detection/quantification, and mathematical equatability of the starch methods were investigated. Approximately 26-55% of raw sugar colour contributed to starch-I-3(-) absorbance. The exclusion of a colour blank negatively affected method accuracy and the addition of a colour blank confirmed that these methods measured mostly colour instead of starch. Inefficient starch solubilization and the inability to standardize sugar colourants explained why starch results from these methods could not be mathematically equated to the USDA Starch Research method, or among different methods. An industrial starch method that efficiently solubilizes starch and includes a colour blank is urgently needed.

AB Research involving human responses to the consumption of starch and its hydrolysis products would benefit from convenient sources of well defined, low cost, food-grade maltooligosaccharides (MOS). This report addresses such need by presenting an approach to obtain aforementioned MOS. A chromatography-ready MOS sample containing proportionately high amounts of low degree of polymerization (DP) MOS is initially prepared from commercially-available maltodextrins (MD) by taking advantage of the DP-dependent differential solubility of MOS in aqueous-ethanol solutions. The low DP-enriched MOS preparation is subsequently fractionated via preparative column chromatography using cellulose-based stationary phases and step-gradient aqueous-ethanol mobile phases. The resulting fractions yielded isolated food-grade MOS ranging in DP from 3 to 7. NMR spectra of isolated MOS indicated minimal amounts of branched saccharides. Typical yields from a single fractionation protocol (2 g MD starting material), including solvent partitioning through preparative chromatography, ranged from similar to 40 mg for DP 4, 5, and 7 to similar to 100 mg for DP 3 and 6.

AB Wastes deriving from production of wines by yeast fermentation of Punica granatum (fermented pomegranate wastes, FPW) showed a marked antioxidant activity in a series of conventional chemical tests. HPLC/MS analysis of the methanol extract showed the presence of ellagic acid (EA) as the main phenolic component at levels up to 40% on a w/w basis. Experiments using murine macrophages showed that FPW extract is able to reduce the LPS-induced expression of pro-inflammatory genes IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha and iNOS. A remarkable increase in the antioxidant properties and extractable EA content was observed following acid hydrolytic treatment of FPW. Under simulated gastrointestinal conditions, EA was slowly released from FPW up to 80% of the overall content over 2 h incubation at the slightly alkaline pHs simulating the small intestine environment, suggesting a potential of the material in nutraceuticals and other applications.

AB Three different wheat cultivars (Bezostaya, Eser and Cesit-1252) at four maturity stages were processed into firik which is a whole wheat-based ethnic food by using traditional cooking method. Some nutritional and anti-nutritional (moisture, ash, protein, fructans, dietary fibers, phenolic contents and antioxidant activity) properties of firiks were investigated. A significant increase was observed for the hectoliter and 1000 kernel weights whereas a decrease for ash and protein contents by increased maturation level. It was found that immature wheats especially at early stages of kernel development are rich sources of functional nutrients such as total dietary fiber (17.3-20.4%), fructans (4.1-7.2%), total phenolics (4602.5-4838.3 mgGAE/kg) and antioxidants (729.2-782.8 mu molTE/100 g) besides having lower phytic acid contents (498.6-604.9 mg/100 g).

AB The treatment of gluten-related disorders is based on a lifelong, and strict, gluten-free diet. Thus, reliable and sensitive methods are required to detect the presence of gluten contamination. Traditional techniques rely on the detection of these proteins based on specific antibodies, but recent approaches go for an indirect route detecting the DNA that indicates the presence of cereals with gluten content. In the current study two different DNA amplification techniques, real-time PCR (qPCR) and real-time Loop-mediated isothermal AMPlification (qLAMP), were evaluated for their capability to detect and quantify gluten. Different detection strategies, based on these DNA amplification techniques, were tested. Even though good specificity results were obtained with the different approaches, overall qPCR proved more sensitive than qLAMP. This is the first study reporting a qLAMP based-method for the detection of gluten-containing cereals, along with its evaluation in comparison with qPCR.

AB Thymol nanoemulsions were produced by spontaneous emulsification, ultrasound, and a combination of both methods. The best result in terms of size and polydispersion was spontaneous emulsification where thymol was efficiently encapsulated, the nanoemulsions inhibited Botrytis cinerea at 110 ppm of thymol. A 10% dilution of this nanoemulsion in water was used to prepare quinoa-chitosan films. The film microstructure was porous and heterogeneous. The tensile strength of the film was significantly lower but its mean elongation at break was similar to that of the control film. The water vapour permeability was similar to that of the control film. The effect of nanoemulsion-thymol-quinoa protein/chitosan coating on mould growth in inoculated cherry tomatoes was evaluated. Compared with control samples (tomatoes without coating and those coated with quinoa protein/chitosan), tomatoes with this coating and inoculated with B. cinerea showed a significant decrease in fungal growth after 7 days at 5 degrees C.

AB Ascorbyl palmitate (AP) and ascorbyl stearate (AS) are examples of food additives, which have extensive use in food industry. In this study, we evaluated the interaction of bovine serum albumin (BSA) with AP and AS using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). In order to immobilize BSA, carboxymethyl dextran hydrogel (CMD) Au chip was used. After activation of carboxylic groups, BSA was immobilized onto the CMD chip through covalent amide binding formation. AP and AS binding to immobilized BSA at different concentrations was assessed. The dose-response sensorgrams of BSA upon increasing concentration of AP and AS have been shown. The low value of equilibrium dissociation constant or affinity unit (K-D ) showed high affinity of both AP and AS to BSA. The KD value for binding of AP and AS to BSA were 4.09x10(-5) and 1.89x10(-5), at 25 degrees C. Overall, the attained results showed that AP and AS molecules can bind to BSA.

AB This work studies the effects of length and unsaturation of alkyl chain on the hydrophobic binding of curcumin with Tween 20, 60 and 80 micelles. While Tween 20 and 60 possess 12 and 18 saturated carbons, respectively, in their alkyl chains, the alkyl chain of Tween 80, with one double bond, has the same length as Tween 60. Tween 60 micelles are superior to Tween 20 and 80 micelles for improving curcumin stability. The fluorescence measurement suggests that Tween 60 micelles provide curcumin with the most hydrophobic microenvironment, owing to the long and saturated alkyl chain of Tween 60. The pK(a1) and binding constants of curcumin have the same order of Tween 60 > Tween 20 > Tween 80. These results show that the length increase, and unsaturation, of the alkyl chain of Tween surfactants have opposite effects on the hydrophobic binding of curcumin with Tween micelles.

AB AS-48 is a bacteriocin with potential application as food biopreservative. In order to optimize its use for oral consumption, we assess the impact of gastrointestinal digestion, both in bulk and adsorbed at the air-water interface. Analysis of AS-48 digestion fragments in bulk by SDS-PAGE, RP-HPLC, and MALDI-TOF proves that the previous pepsin exposition promotes digestion by trypsin/chymotrypsin by exposing new cleavage sites. Regarding adsorbed AS-48, the in vitro digestion profile shows that the conformational change undergone by AS-48 upon adsorption affects its digestibility. Gastrointestinal enzymes cleave only susceptible residues, which are oriented into the aqueous phase, while hydrophobic susceptible residues remain undigested. Evaluation of the elasticity of the adsorbed layer confirms also the presence of undigested AS-48. These results are important towards the use of AS-48 in food formulations; assuring that some intact AS-48 resists digestion guarantees its antibacterial activity throughout the gastrointestinal tract.

AB Enzyme-assisted extraction in liquid-liquid two-phase aqueous system was applied for the first time in order to extract genipin from genipap. The effect of different commercial enzymes, their concentrations, and extraction parameters were investigated. Moreover, chitosan gels were prepared, crosslinked with glutaraldehyde or genipin and characterized by their textural and rheological properties. The crosslinked chitosan was used as support for the immobilization of model beta-galactosidases. Among the different commercial enzymes tested for extraction, Celluclast 10% (36 degrees C and pH 3.7) provided an extraction of 196 mg. g(-1) of genipin. Chitosan gels crosslinked with genipin 0.5% showed better textural and similar rheological properties when compared to the chitosan crosslinked with glutaraldehyde 3%. The percentage of lactose hydrolysis by the immobilized K. lactis beta-galactosidase using genipin as a crosslinker was 87%. Thus, the genipin obtained in this work proved to be an excellent alternative to the use of glutaraldehyde in chitosan crosslinking applications.

AB The matrix polysaccharides of plant cell walls are diverse and variable sets of polymers influencing cell wall, tissue and organ properties. Focusing on the relatively simple parenchyma tissues of four fruits - tomato, aubergine, strawberry and apple - we have dissected cell wall matrix polysaccharide contents using sequential solubilisation and antibody-based approaches with a focus on pectic homogalacturonan (HG) and rhamnoga-lacturonan-I (RG-I). Epitope detection in association with anion-exchange chromatography analysis indicates that in all cases solubilized polymers include spectra of HG molecules with unesterified regions that are separable from methylesterified HG domains. In highly soluble fractions, RG-I domains exist in both HG-associated and non-HG-associated forms. Soluble xyloglucan and pectin-associated xyloglucan components were detected in all fruits. Aubergine glycans contain abundant heteroxylan epitopes, some of which are associated with both pectin and xyloglucan. These profiles of polysaccharide heterogeneity provide a basis for future studies of more complex cell and tissue systems.

AB The potential of ethylene absorbent (EA) to delay softening of 'Lanfeng' blueberry (Vaccinium spp.) fruit in conjunction with cold storage was evaluated. The fruit quality was evaluated after 60 days of storage at 0 degrees C again kept at 20 degrees C, with or without EA. Changes in quality attributes and ethylene biosynthesis and fruit softening indicators were assessed. The results indicated that EA treatment inhibited fruit softening, reduced weight loss and decay, and prevented the loss of total phenolic content. It also decreased the fruit ethylene production by inhibiting 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid oxidase and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase activities, whilst maintaining firmness by hampering cell wall-degrading enzyme activities, especially after more than 30 days of cold storage. In conclusion, EA treatment can inhibit the softening of harvested blueberry fruit during storage at 0 degrees C and shelf life after cold storage. After being refrigerated for more than 30 days at 0 degrees C, the EA has a good effect on blueberries storage.

The variation of the multielemental composition with principal component analysis allowed to discriminate the origin of Bayonne hams. Determined ratio Sr-87/Sr-86 was recognized as a strong additional distinctive parameter. The ratio Sr-87/Sr-86 allowed to better separate all the different categories of hams in addition to the multi-elemental detection. The major contribution of the value Sr-87/Sr-86 for the Bayonne ham is directly related to its curing due to the salt used in process coming from the nearby salt mine Salies-de-Bearn. Since the salt represents around 4% of the final product, it will therefore strongly influence the elemental and isotopic composition of hams. The overall discrimination potential of strontium isotope ratio is evidenced in the final statistical discrimination of the origin of hams.

AB This study investigated a method for validating and determining the measurement uncertainty for the composition of brominated vegetable oil (BVO) in soft drinks and carbonated waters commonly consumed in South Korea. First, we studied a simple and precise qualitative colorimetric method at the maximum residues level 15 ppm. And an analytical method using ion chromatography (IC) was validated and identified with brominated fatty acids by gas chromatography electron ionization mass spectrometry (GC/EI-MS). The measurement uncertainty was evaluated based on the precisional study and confirmed by the preliminary inter-laboratory study. For IC analysis, the recovery range of BVO was from 97.8% to 107.2% with relative standard deviations between 0.18% and 0.69%. In addition, the expanded uncertainty of the BVO was 1.59. These results indicate that the validated method is appropriate for identifying of BVO and can be used to verify the safety of soft drinks or carbonated waters containing BVO residues.

AB The quality properties of fresh noodles with NaCl and alkali were characterized by rheological, cooking, and texture properties. Microstructure, starch viscosity, protein conformation, gelatinization and protein polymerization during cooking, and water status were determined to investigate the mechanisms underlying their quality differences. The results showed that alkali induced more significantly increased (P < .05) gluten strength and noodle hardness, while NaCl resulted in superior dough extensibility. Pasting viscosity of alkaliflour increased and protein conformation changes were detected in alkaline noodles with increased beta-sheet and decreased alpha-helix structures. Both NaCl and alkali increased cooking loss. NaCl induced a fibrous gluten structure while alkali caused a membrane-like structure. Furthermore, remarkable protein aggregates were observed in alkaline noodles immediately after 2 min of cooking in non-reduced HPLC patterns, while 4 min in reduced patterns. Water-solids interaction in alkaline noodles was enhanced with decreased water mobility. NaCl induced no significant changes in protein aggregation and water status.

AB The sensory-chemical profiles of Finnish honeys (labeled as buckwheat, cloudberry-bog, lingonberry, sweet clover, willowherb and multifloral honeys) were investigated using a multi-analytical approach. The sensory test (untrained panel, n = 62) was based on scaling and check-all-that-apply (CATA) methods accompanied with questions on preference and usage of honey. The results were correlated with corresponding profiles of odoractive compounds, determined using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry/olfactometry (GC-MS/O). Botanical origins and chemical compositions including sugars were evaluated using NMR spectroscopy. A total of 73 odor-active compounds were listed based on GC-O. Sweet and mild honeys with familiar sensory properties were preferred by the panelists (PCA, (RX)-X-2(1)= 0.7) while buckwheat and cloudberry-bog honeys with strong odor, flavor and color were regarded as unfamiliar and unpleasant. The data will give the honey industry novel information on honey properties in relation to the botanical origin, and consumer preference.

AB Phenolic compounds in foods have been widely studied due to their health benefits. In cereals, phenolic compounds are extensively linked to cell wall polysaccharides, mainly arabinoxylans, which cross-link with each other and with other cell wall components. In maize, ferulic acid is the phenolic acid present in the highest concentration, forming ferulic acid dehydrodimers, trimers and tetramers. The cross-linking of polysaccharides is important for the cell wall structure and growth, and may protect against pathogen invasion. In addition to the importance for maize physiology, ferulic acid has been recognized as an important chemical structure with a wide range of health benefits when consumed in a diet rich in fibre. This review paper presents the different ways ferulic acid can be present in maize, the importance of ferulic acid derivatives and the methodologies that can be used for their analysis.

AB A novel method was developed by SAE-DLLME for chromium speciation in water and rice samples using 2-thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTA) as a chelating reagent by ETAAS. The speciation of Cr(III) and Cr(VI) was achieved by complexation of Cr(III)-TTA and the total Cr was measured after reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr. The calibration graph was linear in the range of 0.02-2.50 mu g L-1, with a detection limit of 0.0052 mu g L-1. The % RSD was in range of 2.90-3.30% at 0.5, 1.5 and 2.5 mu g L-1 of Cr(III), n = 5 and the EF was 54.47. The method was applied to chromium speciation and total chromium determination in real samples and gave recoveries in the range of 96.2-103.5% and 97.1-102.7% for Cr(III) and Cr(VI) in water samples and 93.7-103.5% of total Cr in rice samples. The accuracy of the method was evaluated by analysis of SRM 1573a with good agreement compared to the certified value.

AB A polyethylene based packaging material containing nano-Ag, nano-TiO2, nano-SiO2, and attapulgite has been prepared. The effect of nanocomposite packaging material (Nano-PM) on the senescence of Flammulina velutipes during 15 days of postharvest storage at 4 degrees C and a relative humidity of 90% were analyzed. The results showed that compared with normal packaging material (Normal-PM) and no packaging (No-PM), Nano-PM improved the appearance quality, reduced weight loss and cap opening. The degree of maturity and increase in molecular weight of F. velutipes polysaccharides (FVP) were delayed. The content loss of proteoglycan protein was less and degree of oxidation was lower. The storage with Nano-PM reduced the fibrosis of texture, cellulase activity, the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and superoxide radical (O-2(center dot) (-)) by 18.9%, 48.3%, 26.6% and 27.8%, respectively (P < .05). The Nano-PM effectively delayed the postharvest senescence of F. velutipes, hence prolonged its shelf life and increased its preservation quality.

AB An eco-friendly method for indirect determining phosphorus and sulfur in animal feed by ion chromatography was proposed. Using this method, it was possible to digest 500 mg of animal feed in a microwave system under oxygen pressure (20 bar) using only a diluted acid solution (2 mol L-1 HNO3). The accuracy of the proposed method was evaluated by recovery tests, by analysis of reference material (RM) and by comparison of the results with those obtained using conventional microwave-assisted digestion. Moreover, P results were compared with those obtained from the method recommended by AOAC International for animal feed (Method nr. 965.17) and no significant differences were found between the results. Recoveries for P and S were between 94 and 97%, and agreements with the reference values of RM were better than 94%. Phosphorus and S concentrations in animal feeds ranged from 10,026 to 28,357 mg kg(-1) and 2259 to 4601 mg kg(-1), respectively.

AB Implementing omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-3 PUFA), naturally found in echium oil (EO), can highly improve the nutritional value of fortified foods. However, PUFA is prone to oxidation. In this study, the role of nanostructured lipid carriers incorporated into whey protein isolate (WPI)-stabilized EO droplets in oil-in-water emulsions was analyzed. Lipid carriers such as lauric (LA), palmitic (PA), and stearic (SA) acids were used. The results reveal that lipid carriers, especially LA, improve the physical stability of these droplets by decreasing their particle size by decreasing the number of surface pores; shown by SEM images and XRD data. Rheological data further show that the emulsions incorporated with LA had higher viscosity and there was also a crossover shift to lower strains in the G'-G" curve of the emulsions incorporating LA. TBARS assay indicated that LA was more effective in protecting EO against oxidation than both palmitic and stearic acids.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of moisture content and storage temperature on the percentage of moldy and fermented beans, mycotoxins levels, phenolic acids content, pasting properties of whole flour, as well as functional and thermal properties of protein isolates from black beans stored for 12 months. Beans stored under 14%/32 degrees C exhibited 16% of fermented grains, while at 17%/25 degrees C (42.3%) and 17%/32 degrees C (93.5%) of moldy plus fermented grains, named drastic conditions (DC). Mycotoxins were not present in grains from all storage conditions. Reduction of gallic, caffeic, and p-hydroxybenzoic acid contents, and increase of sinapic acid were observed in DC. Reduction of peak, final, and setback viscosities of bean flours in DC indicate the application in refrigerated and frozen products. The increase in foaming and reduction in foam degradation of the proteins highlights their use in beverages where the foam is an important factor.

AB The role of antiradical moieties (catechol, guaiacyl and carboxyl group) and molecular conformation in anti-oxidative potency of dihydrocaffeic acid (DHCA) and dihydroferulic acid (DHFA) was investigated by density functional theory (DFT) method. The thermodynamic preference of different reaction paths of double (2H(+)/2e(-)) free radical scavenging mechanisms was estimated. Antiradical potency of DHCA and DHFA was compared with that exerted by their unsaturated analogs - caffeic acid (CA) and ferulic acid (FA). Cis/trans and anti-isomers of studied cinnamic acid derivatives may scavenge free radicals via double processes by involvement of catechol or guaiacyl moiety. Carboxyl group of syn-isomers may also participate in the inactivation of free radicals. Gibbs free energies of reactions with various free radicals indicate that syn-DHCA and syn-DHFA, colon catabolites that could be present in systemic circulation in low mu M concentrations, have a potential to contribute to health benefits by direct free radical scavenging.

AB Impaired glucose homoeostasis due to insulin resistance and decrease sensitivity of pancreatic 13-cells is a feature of liver disease and results into hepatogenous diabetes. Decrease expression of CD39 was linked to inflammation and occurrence of diabetes. Therefore, we performed this study to explore the protective effect of pentoxifylline (PTX) and silymarin administration on the beta-cells of the pancreas in a rat model of thioacetamide induced liver cirrhosis. Biochemical, histological and immunohistochemistry studies of the liver and pancreas were performed and provided an evidence on the protective effect of PTX to pancreatic beta-cells compared to silymarin. Also, silymarin induced a significant improvement of liver cirrhosis compared to PTX. In conclusion, the potential protective effect of PTX against beta-cells deterioration could be attributed to increasing pancreatic CD39 expression and the subsequent increase of adenosine.

AB Color polymorphism is an ecologically important trait, which is related to local adaptation and ecological speciation. The pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum shows color polymorphism: the red and green color morphs where differences in ecological adaptation have been observed. Here, we measured genome-wide gene expression profiles of two color morphs in natural populations of A. pisum to explore the genetic basis of differentiated ecological adaptation. The results showed that only 32 genes were significantly differentially expressed between the two morphs, of which 18 had functional annotations. Among them, 13 genes were up-regulated [e.g. genes encoding protoheme IX farnesyltransferase (LOC100570971), carotene dehydrogenase (tor) and V-type proton ATPase subunit B (LOC100169462)1 and 5 genes were down-regulated in the red morph (e.g. genes encoding transcription factors and heat shock proteins). To assess the functional importance of these differentially expressed genes (DEGs), we selected three highly expressed DEGs (LOC100169462, LOC100570971 and tor) with functional annotations and analyzed their expression levels in the red morph under three low temperatures (1 degrees C, 4 degrees C, and 8 degrees C) for 24 h. These three DEGs showed an interesting expression response to the cold acclimating conditions which resulted in an obvious phenotypic change of the red individuals to be greenish variants. This study suggests a link between gene expressions and body color polymorphisms in the pea aphid and provides important clues for further studying molecular mechanisms of ecological adaptation in aphids.

AB Dopamine (DA) D2-like (and D1-like) receptors are suggested to mediate the dopamine actions in the anterior pituitary and/or CNS of birds. However, the information regarding the structure, functionality, and expression of avian D2-like receptors have not been fully characterized. In this study, we cloned two D2-like receptors (cDRD2, cDRD4) from chicken brain using RACE PCR. The cloned cDRD4 is a 378-amino acid receptor, which shows 57% amino acid (a.a.) identity with mouse DRD4. As in mammals, two cDRD2 isoforms, cDRD2L (long isoform, 437 a.a.) and cDRD2S (short isoform, 408 a.a.), which differ in their third intracellular loop, were identified in chickens. Using cell-based luciferase reporter assays or Western blot, we demonstrated that cDRD4, cDRD2L and cDRD2S could be activated by dopamine and quinpirole (a D2-like receptor agonist) dose-dependently, and their activation inhibits cAMP signaling pathway and stimulates MAPK/ERK signaling cascade, indicating that they are functional receptors capable of mediating dopamine actions. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that cDRD2 and cDRD4 are widely expressed in chicken tissues with abundant expression noted in anterior pituitary, and their expressions are likely controlled by their promoters near exon 1, as demonstrated by dual-luciferase reporter assays in DF-1 cells. In accordance with cDRD2/cDRD4 expression in the pituitary, DA or quinpirole could partially inhibit vasoactive intestinal peptide-induced prolactin expression in cultured chick pituitary cells. Together, our data proves the functionality of DRD2 and DRD4 in birds and aids to uncover the conserved roles of DA/D2-like receptor system in vertebrates, such as its action on the pituitary.

AB Metacaspases (MCAs) are cysteine proteases that share sequence homology with caspases, and may play roles in programmed cell death (PCD). In the present study, we identified a novel MCA gene (CpMCA) from the red tide dinoflagellate Cochlodinium polykrikoides, and examined its molecular characteristics and gene expression in response to algicide-induced cell death. CpMCA cDNA is 1164 bp in length, containing a dinoflagellate spliced leader sequence (dinoSL), an 879-bp open reading frame (ORF), which codes for a 293-aa protein, and a poly (A) tail. Multi-sequence comparison indicated that CpMCA belongs to type I MCA, but it has a different structure at the N-terminal. Phylogenetic analysis showed that C. poly. krikoides may have acquired the MCA gene from bacteria by means of horizontal gene transfer (HGT). In addition, expressions of CpMCA significantly increased following exposure to the common algicides copper sulfate and oxidizing chlorine, which trigger cell death in dinoflagellates, suggesting that CpMCA may be involved in cell death.

AB Cytokinins (CKs) play a crucial role in promoting axillary bud outgrowth and targeting the control of CK metabolism can be used to enhance branching in plants. CK levels are maintained mainly by CK biosynthesis (isopentenyl transferase, IPT) and degradation (dehydrogenase, CKX) genes in plants. A systematic study of the IPT and CKX gene families in apple, however, has not been conducted. In the present study, 12 MdIPTs and 12 MdCKXs were identified in the apple genome. Systematic phylogenetic, structural, and synteny analyses were performed. Expression analysis of these genes in different tissues was also assessed. MdIPT and MdCKX genes exhibit distinct expression patterns in different tissues. The response of MdIPT, MdCKX, and MdPIN1 genes to various treatments (6-BA, decapitation and Lovastatin, an inhibitor of CKs synthesis) that impact branching were also investigated. Results indicated that most of the MdIPT and MdCKX, and MdPIN1 genes were upregulated by 6-BA and decapitation treatment, but inhibited by Lovastatin, a compound that effectively suppresses axillary bud outgrowth induced by decapitation. These findings suggest that cytokinin biosynthesis is required for the activation of bud break and the export of auxin from buds in apple tree with intact primary shoot apex or decapitated apple tree. MdCKX8 and MdCKX10, however, exhibited little response to decapitation, but were significantly up-regulated by 6-BA and Lovastatin, a finding that warrants further investigation in order to understand their function in bud-outgrowth.

AB Mung bean and adzuki bean are warm-season legumes widely cultivated in China. However, bean production in major producing regions is limited by biotic and abiotic stress, such as drought and salt stress. Basic leucine zipper (bZIP) genes play key roles in responses to various biotic and abiotic stresses. However, only several bZIP genes involved in drought and salt stress in legumes, especially Vigna radiata and Vigna angularis, have been identified. In this study, we identified 54 and 50 bZIP proteins from whole-genome sequences of V. radiata and V. angularis, respectively. First, we comprehensively surveyed the characteristics of all bZIP genes, including their gene structure, chromosome distribution and motif composition. Phylogenetic trees showed that VrbZIP and VabZIP proteins were divided into ten clades comprising nine known and one unknown subgroup. The results of the nucleotide substitution rate of the orthologous gene pairs showed that bZIP proteins have undergone strong purifying selection: V. radiata and V. angularis diverged 1.25 million years ago (mya) to 9.20 mya (average of 4.95 mya). We also found that many cis-acting regulatory elements (CAREs) involved in abiotic stress and plant hormone responses were detected in the putative promoter regions of the bZIP genes. Finally, using the quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) method, we performed expression profiling of the bZIP genes in response to drought, salt and abscisic acid (ABA). We identified several bZIP genes that may be involved in drought and salt responses. Generally, our results provided useful and rich resources of VrbZIP and VabZIP genes for the functional characterization and understanding of bZIP transcription factors (TFs) in warm-season legumes. In addition, our results revealed important and interesting data a subset of VrbZIP and VabZIP gene expression profiles in response to drought, salt and ABA stress. These results provide gene expression evidence for the selection of candidate genes under drought and salt stress for future study.

AB Adsorption of cationic surfactants (QACs) Br-tetradecyltrimethylammonium (TTAB), Cl-tetra-decylbenzyldimethylammonium (C(14)BDMA) and Cl-hexadecylbenzyldimethylammonium (C(16)BDMA) to activated sludge from a wastewater treatment plant was tested. Adsorption equilibrium was reached after 2 h, and for initial 200 mg L-1 81%, 90% and 98% of TTAB, C(14)BDMA and C(16)BDMA were respectively adsorbed. After six successive desorption cycles, 21% of TTAB and 12.7% of C(14)BDMA were desorbed from the sludge. In agreement with the percentage of QACs pre-adsorbed, the more hydrophobic the compound, the lesser the extent of desorption. Wastewater samples with activated sludge were supplemented with TTAB 200 mg L-1 and Ca-alginate beads containing the QACs-degrading microorganisms Pseudomonas putida A (ATCC 12633) and Aeromonas hydrophila MFB03. After 24 h, 10 mg L-1 of TTAB were detected in the liquid phase and 6-8 mg L-1 adsorbed to the sludge. Since without Ca-alginate beads or with empty beads total TTAB amount (phase solid and liquid) did not change, the 90% reduction of the initial 200 mg L-1 after treatment with immobilized cells was attributed to the bacterial consortium's capacity to biodegrade QACs. The results show the advantages of using immobilized bacteria to achieve complete QACs elimination from wastewater systems, thus preventing them from reaching the environment.

AB Lipid production by oleaginous Yarrowia lipolytica depends highly on culture environments, such as carbon sources, carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratios, types of media, and cellular growth phases. In this study, the effects of media and carbon sources on lipid and metabolite production were investigated by profiling fatty acids and intracellular metabolites of Y. lipolytica grown in various media. The highest total fatty acid yield 114.04 +/- 6.23 mg/g dry cell weight was achieved by Y. lipolytica grown in minimal medium with glycerol (SCG) in the exponential phase. The high lipid production by Y. lipolytica in SCG was presumed to be due to the higher C/N ratio in SCG than in the complex media. Moreover, glycerol promoted lipid production better than glucose in both complex and minimal media because glycerol can easily incorporate into the core of triglycerides. Metabolite profiling revealed that levels of long- chain fatty acids, such as stearic acid, palmitic acid, and arachidic acid, increased in SCG medium. Meanwhile, in complex media supplemented with either glucose or glycerol, levels of amino acids, such as cysteine, methionine, and glycine, highly increased. This metabolomic approach could be applied to modulate the global metabolic network of Y. lipolytica for producing lipids and other valuable products.

AB Clostridium tyrobutyricum is an excellent microorganism for bio-based butyric acid production. However, the main obstacles for its industrialization are low butyric acid concentration and productivity. This study indicated that overexpression of rate-limiting enzymes in the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway, including 6-phosphofructokinase (pfkA) and pyruvate kinase (pykA), in C. tyrobutyricum ATCC 25755 could enhance its intracellular NADH and ATP levels and resistance to butyric acid and glucose. The results of fed-batch fermentation by ATCC 25755/pfkA+ pykA showed that the butyrate concentration and productivity reached 48.2 g/L and 0.50 g/L h, which increased 38.1% and 38.9% as compared with the wild-type, respectively. The increased butyric acid tolerance and production could be due to the higher intracellular NADH and ATP levels by overexpression of pfkA and pykA in C. tyrobutyricum ATCC 25755. Furthermore, ATCC 25755/pfkA+ pykA exhibited higher glucose tolerance. Consequently, the productivity of butyrate was further increased by 64.0% in batch fermentation using high concentration of glucose (120 g/L).

AB Riboswitches are RNA elements found in non-coding regions of messenger RNAs that regulate gene expression through a ligand-triggered conformational change. Riboswitches typically bind tightly and specifically to their ligands, so they have the potential to serve as highly effective sensors in vitro. In B. subtilis and other gram-positive bacteria, purine nucleotide synthesis is regulated by riboswitches that bind to guanine. We modified the xpt-pbuX guanine riboswitch for use in a fluorescence quenching assay that allowed us to specifically detect and quantify guanine in vitro. Using this assay, we reproducibly detected as little as 5 nM guanine. We then produced sensors for 2'-deoxyguanosine and cyclic diguanylate (c-diGMP) by appending the P1 stem of the guanine riboswitch to the ligand-binding domains of a 2'-deoxyguanosine riboswitch and a c-diGMP riboswitch. These hybrid sensors could detect 15 nM 2'-deoxyguanosine and 3 nM c-diGMP, respectively. Each sensor retained the ligand specificity of its corresponding natural riboswitch. In order to extend the utility of our approach, we developed a strategy for the in vitro selection of sensors with novel ligand specificity. Here we report a proof-of-principle experiment that demonstrated the feasibility of our selection strategy.

AB Targeted gene modification is a novel intervention strategy to increase disease resistance more quickly than traditional animal breeding. Human lysozyme, a natural, non-specific immune factor, participates in innate immunity, exerts a wide range of antimicrobial activities against pathogens, and has immuneregulatory effects. Therefore, it is a candidate gene for improved disease resistance in animals. In this study, we successfully generated a transgenic mouse model by microinjecting a modified bacterial artificial chromosome containing a recombinant human lysozyme (rhLZ) gene into the pronuclei of fertilized mouse embryos. rhLZ was expressed in serum, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, stomach, small intestine, and large intestine but not in milk. rhLZ protein concentrations in the serum of transgenic mice ranged from 2.09 to 2.60 mg/l. To examine the effect of rhLZ on intestinal microbiota, total aerobes, total anaerobes, Clostridium, Enterococcus, Streptococcus, Salmonella, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus, Bifidobacterium, and Lactobacillus were measured in the intestines of transgenic and wild type mice. Results showed that Bifidobacteria were significantly increased (p < 0.001), whereas Salmonella were significantly decreased (p < 0.001) in transgenic mice compared to wild type mice. Our study suggests that rhLZ expression is a potential strategy to increase animal disease resistance.

AB Delta(9)-Tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA) is a secondary natural product from the plant Cannabis sativa L. with therapeutic indications like analgesics for cancer pain or reducing spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis. Here, we investigated the influence of the co-expression of 12 helper protein genes from Komagataella phaffii (formerly Pichia pastoris) on the functional expression of the Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid synthase (THCAS) heterologously expressed in K. phaffii by screening 21 clones of each transformation. Our findings substantiate the necessity of a suitable screening system when interfering with the secretory network of K. phaffii. We found that co-production of the chaperones CNE1p and Kar2p, the foldase PDI1p, the UPR-activator Hac1p as well as the FAD synthetase FAD1p enhanced THCAS activity levels within the K. phaffii cells. The strongest influence showed co-expression of Hac1s - increasing the volumetric THCAS activities 4.1-fold on average. We also combined co-production of Hac1p with the other beneficial helper proteins to further enhance THCAS activity levels. An optimized strain overexpressing Hac1s, FAD1 and CNE1 was isolated that showed 20-fold increased volumetric, intracellular THCAS activity compared to the starting strain. We used this strain for a whole cell bioconversion of cannabigerolic acid (CBGA) to THCA. After 8 h of incubation at 37 degrees C, the cells produced 3.05 g L-1 THCA corresponding to 12.5% g(THCA) g(CDW)(-1).

AB Halohydrin dehalogenase from Agrobacterium radiobacter AD1 (HheC) shows great potential to produce valuable optically pure epoxides and beta-substituted alcohols. However, this enzyme has been reported to be very sensitive and less stable under oxidative conditions. Enzyme immobilization represents a powerful means to overcome this limitation and provides the enzyme characteristics of a biocatalyst. In this study, the crude extract of HheC was directly subjected to enzyme immobilization using a carrier-free cross-linked enzyme aggregates (CLEAs) method. The results showed that under the optimized conditions, the obtained HheC-CLEAs retained more than 90% activity of the free enzyme; preserved more than 50% of their original activity after storage at 4 degrees C for 2 months, even in the absence of a reducing agent; displayed a strong tolerance to organic solvents with fully active after incubation in the presence of 50% cyclohexane and n-hexane for 5 h; the presence of organic solvents could minimize the negative effect of enzyme immobilization on the enzntioselectivity of HheC. Most importantly, HheCeCLEAs maintained more than 70% activity after 10 reusability cycles. The utility of HheCeCLEAs as a valuable biocatalyst was exhibited by the kinetic resolution of azide-mediated ring-opening reaction of rac-1,2-epoxy-2-methylbutane. These results indicated that HheCeCLEAs overcame some disadvantages of free enzymes to become biocatalysts. Together with further engineering of the enzyme, HheCeCLEAs could become a promising biocatalyst for the synthesis of valuable chiral compounds.

AB Xylanases Tx-xyn10 and Tx-xyn11 were compared for their transxylosylation abilities in the presence of various acceptors. Tx-xyn10 exhibited a broad specificity for various acceptors, whereas xylanase Tx-xyn11 catalysed transxylosylation reactions only in presence of polyphenolic acceptors. A modelling approach was developed to study the molecular bottlenecks into the active site of the enzyme that could be responsible for this restricted specificity. The glycosyl-enzyme intermediate of Tx-xyn11 was modelled, and a rotamer of the Y78 residue was integrated. In silico mutations of some residues from the (+1) and (+2) subsites were tested for the deglycosylation step in the presence of non-polyphenolic acceptors. The results indicated that the mutant W126A was able to use aliphatic alcohols and benzyl alcohol as acceptors for transxylosylation. Experimental validation was tested by mutating the xylanase Tx-xyn11 at position W126 into alanine. The specific activity and catalytic efficiency of the W126A mutant during the hydrolysis of xylans decreased by 2-fold and 4-fold, respectively, compared to wild-type xylanase. Among tested acceptors, transxylosylation catalysed by mutant W126A was improved with benzyl alcohol leading to a 2-fold higher concentration of benzyl xylobioside, as predicted by in silico mutation. This improved transxylosylation in the presence of benzyl alcohol leading to higher synthesis of benzyl xylobioside could likely be explained by lowest steric hindrance in the aglycone subsite of the mutated xylanase. No secondary hydrolysis of benzyl xylobioside occurred for both wild-type and mutant xylanases. Finally, our results demonstrated that the modelling approach was limited and that accounting for protein dynamics can lead to improved models.

AB CpG-SNPs in gene promoter regions are proposed to be associated with multiple diseases. To date, few studies have focused on the associations between CpG-SNPs in miRNA promoters and the risk of breast cancer. In this study, 138 miRNAs differentially expressed between breast cancer and non-cancer tissues (fold change > 2, P < 0.05) were identified using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research database. In total, 13 SNPs were selected in the promoters of the miRNAs and were evaluated in a case-control study of Chinese women including 1486 cases and 1519 controls. After multivariate logistic regression analysis, we found that three CpG-SNPs: rs1190983, rs155247, and rs62382272, were significantly associated with breast-cancer susceptibility in the population (Additive model: rs1190983: adjusted OR = 0.88, 95% CI: 0.79-0.99, P = 0.034; rs155247: adjusted OR = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.74-0.93, P = 0.002; rs62382272: adjusted OR = 1.24, 95% CI: 1.04-1.47, P = 0.016). eQTL analysis showed that these three SNPs were correlated with the expression of the related miRNAs in TCGA breast cancer tissues (P = 0.006,0.009,0.001 for rs1190983, rs155247, and rs62382272). Furthermore, rs1190983 was found to be associated with CpG site (cg20488673) methylation (meQTL) (P = 0.004), which was in turn correlated with miR-342 expression (P = 0.016). These findings indicated that the three CpG-SNPs in the promoters of miRNAs were likely to possess important biological functions to breast cancer in the Han Chinese population.

AB Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY) is a monogenic form of diabetes characterized by autosomal dominant inheritance, an early clinical onset and a primary defect in beta-cell function. Mutations in the GCK and HNFIA genes are the most common cause of MODY among Caucasians. The etiology of MODY in Tunisia stills a challenge for researchers. The aim of this study was to screen for mutations in GCK, HNF1A, HNF4A and INS genes in North African Tunisians subjects, in whom the clinical profile was very suggestive of MODY. A total of 23 unrelated patients, with clinical presentation of MODY were tested for mutations in GCK, HNF1A, HNF4A and INS genes, using Denaturing High Performance Liquid Chromatography (DHPLC), Multiplex Ligation-depend Probe Amplification (MLPA) and sequencing analysis. We identified the previously reported mutation c 169C > T in one patient as well as a new mutation c-457C > T in two unrelated patients. No mutations were detected in the HNFIA and INS genes. Despite restrictive clinical criteria used for selecting patients in this study, the most common genes known for MODY do not explain the majority of cases in Tunisians. This suggests that there are others candidate or unidentified genes contributing to the etiology of MODY in Tunisians families.

   IDENTIFICATION
AB Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CPKs), being Ser/Thr protein kinases found only in plants and some protozoans are calcium sensors that regulate diverse biological processes. However, the function and mode of CPKs in oilseed rape (Brassica napus) remain elusive. In this study, we identified CPK2 from oilseed rape as a novel regulator of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cell death. BnaCPK2 was identified to be located at the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Expression of BnaCPK2 was induced during Bax-induced cell death. Overexpression of the constitutively active form of BnaCPK2 led to significantly more accumulation of ROS and cell death than the full-length CPK2, which is supported by various measurements of physiological data. In addition, a quantitative RT-PCR survey revealed that the expression levels of a few marker genes are significantly changed as a result of CPK2 expression. Mating-based split ubiquitin system (mbSUS) and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) were used to screen and confirm the BnaCPK2 interacting proteins. We identified and confirmed that CPK2 interacted with NADPH oxidase-like respiratory burst oxidase homolog D (RbohD), but not with RbohF. Based on its function and interacting partners, we propose that BnaCPK2 plays an important role in ROS and cell death control through interacting with RbohD.

AB Complete genome characterization of non-porcine origin Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) was first described in 2014 in China. In the present study, we first identified PCV2 nucleotides in goat samples and the prevalence of PCV2 in goat was 6.15%. However, only two new strains, Goat2014-4 and Goat2014-5, could be completely sequenced. The genome of the strain Goat2014-4, which collected from the goat infected with PPRV, contains 1766 nt; strain Goat2014-5, which originated from a healthy goat, is comprised of 1767 nt. The results showed that they shared the highest nucleotide identity with BDH and the lowest similarity with DK198OPMWSfree strain and they belonged only to genotype PCV2d. Meanwhile, they shared higher homology with porcine-origin PCV2 strains than others. Moreover, a detailed analysis of the capsid amino acid sequences revealed that there were distinct differences for goat2014-4 (708 bp) and goat2014-5 (705 bp); strain Goat2014-4 showed an elongation of two amino acids, and strains Goat 2014-5 showed an elongation of one amino acid compared with other reference strains. This is the first report of the genetic analysis of goat-origin PCV2 isolates. It also provides an additional supported evidence for cross-species transmission of PCV2.

AB Serum uric acid (SUA) levels are highly heritable and an increased SUA level is one of important risk factors for gout, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular diseases. The genetic variants underlying SUA remains largely unexplored. The aim was to explore new genetic variants underlying SUA in Chinese Han. We performed a genome-wide association study of SUA levels in Han Chinese. The discovery set contained 1634 samples and subsequent replication was comprised of 1649 females and 1169 males. 2620 subjects were recruited in the detailed analysis of rs671, alcohol drinking and SUA. We found a genome-wide significant association between SUA level and the SNP rs671 at ALDH2 (P = 1.2 x 10(-10)) in the merged data. In addition, we also replicated the signal from rs3733590 at SLC2A9 (P = 1.0 x 10(-10)). In males, about 0.21% to 1.95% of the total variance for SUA can be explained by rs671 using linear regression models in four independent cohorts. Of those, 56.75% to 93.51% might be explained by altering alcohol consumption due to rs671. No statistical association of rs671 and SUA was observed in females (P = 0.409). Furthermore, we observed a causal relationship between alcohol consumption and SUA in males using rs671 as an instrumental variable (P = 5.1 x 10(-4)). We replicated the previous findings in SLC2A9. Our evidence supported that rs671 was associated with SUA by affecting alcohol consumption in males. This finding strongly suggests a role for alcohol consumption in the development of hyperuricaemia and uric acid related traits.

AB Corins are membrane-bound protease that regulates blood pressure by activating the natriuretic peptides. These pro-atrial natriuretic peptide convertases are essential for sodium homeostasis and normal blood pressure. CORIN variants have been identified in humans and other animals, but no studies of CORIN polymorphisms have been conducted in northeastern China. This study aims to investigate the association of 2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CORIN (rs2271037 and rs3749585) with hypertension, as well as their potential interactions with some risk factors of hypertension in a Han population of northeastern China. A case-control study, including 402 patients with hypertension and 406 participants with normal blood pressure, was conducted in Liaoning province. SNP genotyping was carried out by high resolution melting (HRM) after polymerase chain reaction amplifications. Since rs3749585 is located in 3' untranslated region (UTR) of CORIN, in silico analysis was used to predict target micro RNAs on TargetScan, miRanda, and DIANA-microT. As a result, mutant T allele in rs2271037 (odds ratio [OR], 1.693; 95% confidence [CI], 1.528-1.877; p < 0.001) and C allele in rs3749585 (OR, 1.114; 95% CI 1.011-1.227; p = 0.029) increased the risk of hypertension, comparing with wild G allele and T allele, respectively. Patients with genotype TT (OR, 10.209; 95% CI, 6.414-16.250; p < 0.001) and GT (OR, 1.730; 95% CI, 1.226-2.443; p = 0.002) have higher risk of hypertension than those with genotype GG. SNP rs2271037 was significantly associated with susceptibility to hypertension in all genetic models (dominant model: OR, 2.879; 95% CI, 2.080-3.986; p < 0.001; recessive model: OR, 7.159; 95% CI, 4.779-10.724; p < 0.001; additive model: OR, 1.535; 95% CI, 1.163-2.027; p = 0.002). SNP rs3749585 was significantly correlated with hypertension susceptibility only in dominant model (OR, 1.533; 95% CI, 1.073-2.189; p = 0.019), but not in recessive model (OR, 1.220; 95% CI, 0.906-1.644; p = 0.191) or additive model (OR, 0.915; 95% CI, 0.694-1.205; p = 0.527). After adjusting for age, gender, body mass index (BMI), smoking, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and serum sodium level in logistic models, the same statistical results were obtained. Interaction study showed the association between CORIN polymorphisms and hypertension could be changed by overweight (BMI 25 kg/m(2)). In silico analyses implicated hsa-miR-495 as a target miRNA that potentially interacts with the 3' UTR of CORIN. In conclusion, polymorphisms of rs2271037 and rs3749585 in CORIN were significantly associated with hypertension in a Han population of northeastern China. The mutant-type T allele of rs2271037 and C allele of rs3749585 might increase the susceptibility to hypertension in this population.

AB Although the correlation of the RAGE rs2070600 polymorphism and cancer risk has been confirmed, detailed studies with functional and experimental evaluations are lacking. In this study, we first aimed to examine whether this polymorphism is associated with cancer risk based on the latest published data, and consistent with previous meta-analyses, a significant association between the rs2070600 polymorphism and cancer risk was observed (A versus G: OR = 1.25; 95% CI = 1.12-1.40). In additional stratified analyses based on cancer type, rs2070600 was significantly associated with an increased risk of lung cancer (A versus G: OR = 1.20; 95% CI = 1.09-1.33). Moreover, TCGA database showed that the expression level of RAGE was significantly lower in lung cancer tumour tissues than in adjacent non-tumour tissues, which was validated in the GEO database. Additionally, eQTL analysis indicated that the rs2070600 polymorphism may modify the expression level of RAGE in lung squamous cell carcinoma tissues (P = 0.09). Finally, we performed functional experiments in lung cancer cells and preliminarily demonstrated that RAGE may act as a tumour suppressor in lung cancer development. These findings provide evidence that the variant A allele of rs2070600 may decrease the expression of the tumour suppressor gene RAGE, thereby increasing lung cancer risk.

AB Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder. Genetic and functional studies have strongly implicated the disrupted in schizophrenia 1 gene (DISCI) as a candidate susceptibility gene for schizophrenia. Moreover, recent association studies have indicated that several DISCI single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are associated with schizophrenia. However, the association is hardly replicate in different ethnic group. Here, we performed a meta-analysis of the association between DISCI SNPs and schizophrenia in which the samples were divided into subgroups according to ethnicity. Both rs3738401 and rs821616 showed not significantly association with schizophrenia in the Caucasian, Asian, Japanese or Han Chinese populations.

AB Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), as one of neurodevelopmental disorders, affects about 1/160 of people worldwide. The etiology and pathogenesis of ASD remain elusive. Synapses are essential components of neurons and basic information transmission unit in the nervous system, adjusting behavior to environmental stimuli and controlling body functions, memories, and emotions. SHANK3 is one of the synapse genes which play important roles in maintaining synaptic structure and function. SHANK3 has been researched as a probably susceptibility gene for ASD. We investigated the association between polymorphisms in SHANK3 and ASD in the Northeast Han Chinese population. A total of 470 subjects (229 cases and 241 controls) were enrolled in our case-control study. Five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs756638, rs4824116, rs76268556, rs9616915, and rs75767639) in SHANK3 were selected and genotyped. Our study did not identify a significant association of SHANK3 SNPs with ASD in the Northeast Han Chinese population. Future studies need to test more SHANK3 SNPs in large sample to demonstrate the association between SNPs in SHANK3 and ASD.

AB Genetic and environmental factors such as high-fat diet are involved in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Cynomolgus monkey shares similar genetic makeup, tissue structures, physiology and metabolic function to human. This study aimed to establish T2DM model in cynomolgus monkey and compare expression profiles of hepatic genes and their associated pathways in normal cynomolgus monkeys and those with T2DM. We employed RNA-seq technique and identified 1451 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with a false discovery rate (FOR) of 0.1% between normal and T2DM animals. KEGG pathway analysis revealed that DEGs were associated with 12 KEGG pathways (P < 0.05). Two of these pathways were associated with metabolism and five were related to immunity. Unexpected, we found ECM-receptor interaction pathway. In conclusion, our data suggest that three major pathways may be implicated in the development of T2DM, including steroid biosynthesis, immune response and ECM. Further characterization of these pathways may provide new targets for the prevention and therapy of T2DM.

AB The study profiled the differential miRNA expression from femoral head bone microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) between model group and control group to explore the pathogenesis of steroid-induced osteonecrosis of femoral head (ONFH). Twenty 8-week-old Female Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into control and model groups. Rats in model group received an intraperitoneal injection of 20-mu g/kg lipopolysaccharide (LPS) at an interval of 24 h. Then, 24 h later, rats received three doses of 40-mg/kg methylprednisolone by intramuscular injection at intervals of 24 h. In control group, rats received the same volume of normal saline. After 4 weeks, the femoral heads were sectioned to confirm the establishment of the model. To replicate the animal model ex vivo, BMECs were isolated. Different miRNAs were screened using Agilent Gene Spring GX software, and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was used to confirm the results of miRNA microarray analysis. The differentially expressed miRNA were assessed by bioinformatics analysis. Four differentially expressed miRNAs were identified (two upregulated: miR-132-3p, miR-335 and two down regulated: miR-466b-2-3p, let-7c-1-3p). qPCR results were consistent with the gene-chip results. Steroid-induced ONFH may cause miRNA changes in BMECs. miR-132-3p and miR-335 may be important in steroid-induced ONFH.

AB Bioinformatics and comparative genomics analysis methods were used to predict unknown pathogen genes based on homology with identified or functionally clustered genes. In this study, the genes of common pathogens were analyzed to screen and identify genes associated with intracellular survival through sequence similarity, phylogenetic tree analysis and the lambda-Red recombination system test method. The total 38,952 protein-coding genes of common pathogens were divided into 19,775 clusters. As demonstrated through a COG analysis, information storage and processing genes might play an important role intracellular survival. Only 19 clusters were present in facultative intracellular pathogens, and not all were present in extracellular pathogens. Construction of a phylogenetic tree selected 18 of these 19 clusters. Comparisons with the DEG database and previous research revealed that seven other clusters are considered essential gene clusters and that seven other clusters are associated with intracellular survival. Moreover, this study confirmed that clusters screened by orthologs with similar function could be replaced with an approved uvrY gene and its orthologs, and the results revealed that the usg gene is associated with intracellular survival. The study improves the current understanding of intracellular pathogens characteristics and allows further exploration of the intracellular survival-related gene modules in these pathogens.

AB Sex-determining region of the Y chromosome (SRY) gene plays a crucial role in male sexual differentiation and development. Several mutations in the SRY gene have been reported in the high mobility group (HMG) box domain and can cause gonadal dysgenesis symptoms. In this study, we report that a novel missense mutation in the SRY gene, a G to A transition within the HMG box, causes the Ala66Thr amino acid substitution in a female patient presenting 46,XY karyotype with pure gonadal dysgenesis. The G to A base transition was not found in the SRY sequence after the screening of 100 normal males. Furthermore, Ala66Thr mutation drastically reduced the binding capacity of SRY to DNA sequences, whereas wild-type SRY protein showed the normal binding capacity to DNA sequences in vitro. We also found that the mutant SRY protein was partly localized in cytoplasm, whereas wild-type SRY protein was strictly localized in cell nucleus. In addition, we analyzed the three-dimensional structure of SRY protein by homology modeling methods. In conclusion, we identified a novel SRY mutation in a 46,XY female patient with pure gonadal dysgenesis, demonstrating the importance of the Ala66Thr mutation in DNA binding activity and nuclear transport.

AB Background: Genome-wide association study (GWAS) studies have showed that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in OCA2 gene were associated with the survival of breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy. To further explain the association between OCA2 SNPs and breast cancer survival, we investigated the predictive value of rs4778137 located in OCA2 in local advanced breast cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
   Patients and methods: A case-cohort with 150 breast cancer patients was performed to evaluate the effects of the OCA2 rs4778137 on breast cancer survival. The association between rs4778137 genotypes and pathological complete response (pCR, defined that the postoperative pathology indicating no residual invasive breast cancer in the breast or the axillary lymph node) were analyzed. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the independent predictors of pCR. Survival was assessed by Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression analysis according to the rs4778137 genotypes.
   Results: The differences between pCR and the rs4778137 genotypes were statistically significant (p < 0.05). The patients with genotype GG harbored a better disease-free survival (HR: 2.358, p = 0.000) and overall survival (HR: 1.578, p = 0.008) than the patients with genotype CC in rs4778137. The further Univariate and Multivariate survival analysis revealed that SNP rs4778137 was an independent predictive factor of disease-free survival (p = 0.000/p = 0.001) and overall survival (p = 0.006/p = 0.045).
   Conclusion: The OCA2 rs4778137 may be a predictor for the clinical response and survival in local advanced breast cancer patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

AB The epigenetics methylation of cytosine is the most common epigenetic form in DNA sequences. It is highly concentrated in the promoter regions of the genes, leading to an inactivation of tumor suppressors regardless of their initial function. In this work, we aim to identify the highly methylated regions; the cytosine-phosphate guanine (CpG) island located on the promoters and/or the first exon gene known for their key roles in the cell cycle, hence the need to study gene-gene interactions. The Frommer and hidden Markov model algorithms are used as computational methods to identify CpG islands with specificity and sensitivity up to 76% and 80%, respectively. The results obtained show, on the one hand, that the genes studied are suspected of developing hypermethylation in the promoter region of the gene involved in the case of a cancer. We then showed that the relative richness in CG results from a high level of methylation. On the other hand, we observe that the gene gene interaction exhibits co-expression between the chosen genes. This let us to conclude that the hidden Markov model algorithm predicts more specific and valuable information about the hypermethylation in gene as a preventive and diagnostics tools for the personalized medicine; as that the tumor-suppresser-genes have relative co-expression and complementary relations which the hypermethylation affect in the samples studied in our work.

AB Eukaryotic cells evolved highly complex and accurate protein synthesis machinery that is finely tuned by various signaling pathways. Dysregulation of translation is a hallmark of many diseases, including cancer, and thus pharmacological approaches to modulate translation become very promising. While there has been much progress in our understanding of mammalian mRNA-specific translation control, surprisingly, relatively little is known about whether and how the protein components of the translation machinery shape translation of their own mRNAs. Here we analyze mammalian mRNAs encoding components of the translation initiation machinery for potential regulatory features such as 5'TOP motifs, TISU motifs, poor start codon nucleotide context and upstream open reading frames.

AB This study aimed to explore crucial genes, transcription factors (TFs), and microRNAs (miRNAs) associated with the effects of curcumin against hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We downloaded data (GSE59713) from Gene Expression Omnibus to analyze differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between curcumin-treated and untreated HCC cell lines. Then, we identified the disease ontology (DO) and functional enrichment analysis of these DEGs and analyzed their protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Additionally, we constructed TF-target gene and miRNA-target gene regulatory networks and explored the potential functions of these DEGs. Finally, we detected the expression of CDKN1A, CTGF, LEF1 TF and MIR-19A regulated by curcumin in PLC/PRF/5 cells using RT-PCR. In total, 345 upregulated and 212 downregulated genes were identified. The main enriched pathway of upregulated genes was the TNF signaling pathway. The downregulated genes were significantly enriched in TGF-beta signaling pathway. In addition, most DEGs were significantly enriched in DO terms such as liver cirrhosis, hepatitis, hepatitis C and cholestasis (eg., CTGF). In the constructed PPI network, CDKN1A and CTGF were the key proteins. Moreover, LEF1, CDKN1A, and miR-19A that regulated CTGF were highlighted in the regulatory networks. Furthermore, the expression of CDKN1A, CTGF, LEF1 TF and miR-19A regulated by curcumin in PLC/PRF/5 cells was consistent with the aforementioned bioinformatics analysis results. To conclude, curcumin might exert its protective effects against HCC tumorigenesis by downregulating LEF1 and downregulating CTGF regulated by MIR-19A and upregulating CDKN1A expression.

AB Background: Estrogen is key to breast cancer pathogenesis, and acts by binding its receptor (ER), which exists as ER alpha and ER beta, encoded by ESR1 and ESR2 genes, respectively. Studies that investigated the association of ESR1 and ESR2 variants with breast cancer yielded mixed outcome, and ethnic contribution was proposed. We evaluated the association between ESR1 and ESR2 variants and breast cancer and associated features in Tunisian women.
   Methods: Retrospective case-control study involving 207 female breast cancer patients, and 284 control women. Genotyping was done by real-time PCR.
   Results: Minor allele frequencies (MAF) of tagging SNPs rs2234693 and rs3798577 (ESR1) were significantly higher, while MAF of rs1256049 (ESR2) was significantly lower in breast cancer patients vs. controls. Patients carrying rs3798577 genotypes had higher risk, while rs1256049 genotype carriers had reduced risk of breast cancer. The association of ESR1 and ESR2 gene variants with breast cancer depended on ER and Her-2 status. ESR1 rs3798577 and ESR2 rs1256049 were associated with breast cancer in ER-positive cases, and ESR1 rs2234693, and rs3798577 were associated with breast cancer in Her-2-negative cases, while the association of ESR2 rs1256049 with breast cancer was seen in Her-2 positive cases. Haploview analysis identified 4-locus ESR1 haplotypes that were positively (CGTT, TACC, and TACT), and negatively (CGTC) associated with breast cancer. No ESR2 haplotypes associated with breast cancer were identified.
   Conclusion: ESR1 alleles and genotypes, and specific 3-locus ESR1 haplotypes are related with increased breast cancer susceptibility in Tunisian women. However, ESR2 variant and specific 1-locus ESR1 haplotype have a protective effect.

AB Objective: High altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) is a life threatening condition occurring in otherwise healthy individuals who rapidly ascend to high altitude. However, the molecular mechanisms of its pathophysiology are not well understood. The objective of this study is to evaluate differential gene expression in patients with HAPE during acute illness and subsequent recovery.
   Methods: Twenty-one individuals who ascended to an altitude of 3780 m were studied, including 12 patients who developed HAPE and 9 matched controls without HAPE. Whole-blood samples were collected during acute illness and subsequent recovery for analysis of the expression of hypoxia-related genes, and physiologic and laboratory parameters, including mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP), heart rate, blood pressure, and arterial oxygen saturation (SpO(2)), were also measured.
   Results: Compared with control subjects, numerous hypoxia-related genes were up-regulated in patients with acute HAPE. Gene network analyses suggested that HIF-1 alpha played a central role in acute HAPE by affecting a variety of hypoxia-related genes, including BNIP3L, VEGFA, ANGPTL4 and EGLN1. Transcriptomic profiling revealed the expression of most HAPE-induced genes was restored to a normal level during the recovery phase except some key hypoxia response factors, such asBNIP3L, EGRJ, MMP9 and VEGF, which remained persistently elevated.
   Conclusions: Differential expression analysis of hypoxia-related genes revealed distinct molecular signatures of HAPE during acute and recovery phases. This study may help us to better understand HAPE pathogenesis and putative targets for further investigation and therapeutic intervention.

AB Background: More than 10 years after the authorisation of two rotavirus vaccines of demonstrated efficacy and with a strongly positive benefit-risk profile, uptake in Europe remains low. Only 13 countries in Europe provide a fully-funded rotavirus universal mass vaccination (UMV) programme, three provide a partially-funded programme, and one provides full funding for a reduced programme targeting at-risk infants. Around 40% of countries in Europe currently have no existing recommendations for rotavirus vaccine use in children from the national government.
   Methods: We provide an overview of the status of rotavirus vaccine recommendations across Europe and the factors impeding uptake. We consider the evidence for the benefits and risks of vaccination, and argue that cost-effectiveness and cost-saving benefits justify greater access to rotavirus vaccines for infants living in Europe.
   Results: Lack of awareness of the direct and indirect burden caused by rotavirus disease, potential cost saving from rotavirus vaccination including considerable benefits to children, families and society, and government/insurer cost constraints all contribute to complacency at different levels of health policy in individual countries.
   Conclusions: More than 10 years after their introduction, available data confirm the benefits and acceptable safety profile of infant rotavirus UMV programmes. Europe serves to gain considerably from rota virus UMV in terms of reductions in healthcare resource utilization and related costs in both vaccinated subjects and their unvaccinated siblings through herd protection.

AB Potent adjuvant systems are required for subunit and single antigen based vaccines to provide sufficient immunogenicity. Furthermore, adjuvants can reduce the required number of immunisations and the antigen amount. Squalene nanoemulsions, like MF59 (R) and AddaVax (TM), are potent, safe and well characterised adjuvant systems and approved for use in humans. Here, we developed squalene containing solid lipid nanoparticles, which can be sterilised by steam sterilisation and stored as freeze-dried power together with a yeast-based vaccine. Detailed size measurements using dynamic and static light scattering were applied, as the immune stimulating effect of squalene emulsions is mainly dependent on the particle size. The size range of AddaVax (TM) (120-170 nm) was favoured for the developed squalene containing solid lipid nanoparticles. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and H NMR studies were performed to characterise the interactions of the incorporated liquid squalene with the solid hard fat matrix. A homogeneous distribution as liquid domains in the solid glyceride structure was suggested for the liquid squalene. The developed adjuvant was compared with Freund's adjuvant and a commercially available squalene nanoemulsion in a vaccine trial in the mouse model with a yeast-based vaccine directed against the infectious bursal disease virus. All squalene-based adjuvants showed excellent biocompatibility and provided immune stimulating properties comparable to Freund's adjuvant. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes acute respiratory tract infections in infants, the elderly and immunocompromised individuals. No licensed vaccine is available against RSV. We previously reported that intranasal immunization of rodents and lambs with a RSV vaccine candidate (Delta F/TriAdj) induces protective immunity with a good safety profile. Delta F/TriAdj promoted innate immune responses in respiratory mucosal tissues in vivo, by local chemokine and cytokine production, as well as infiltration and activation of immune cells including macrophages. The macrophage is an important cell type in context of both innate and adaptive immune responses against RSV. Therefore, we characterized the effects of Delta F/TriAdj on a murine macrophage cell line, RAW264.7, and bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs). A gene expression study of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) revealed induction of endosomal and cytosolic receptors in RAW264.7 cells and BMMs by Delta F/TriAdj, but no up-regulation by Delta F in PBS. As a secondary response to the PRR gene expression, induction of several chemokines and pro inflammatory cytokines, as well as up-regulation of MHC-II and co-stimulatory immune markers, was observed. To further investigate the mechanisms involved in Delta F/TriAdj-mediated secondary responses, we used relevant signal transduction pathway inhibitors. Based on inhibition studies at both transcript and protein levels, JNK, ERK1/2, CaMKII, P13K and JAK pathways were clearly responsible for Delta F/ TriAdj-mediated chemokine and pro-inflammatory cytokine responses, while the p38 and NF-kappa B pathways appeared to be not or minimally involved. Delta F/TriAdj induced IFN-beta, which may participate in the JAK-STAT pathway to further amplify CXCL-10 production, which was strongly up-regulated. Blocking this pathway by a JAK inhibitor almost completely abrogated CXCL-10 production and caused a significant reduction in the cell surface expression of MHC-II and co-stimulatory immune markers. These data demonstrate that Delta F/TriAdj induces multiple signaling pathways in macrophages. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO VACCINE

ID GLOBAL IMPACT; DIARRHEA; MORTALITY; INFANTS; SAFETY
AB Live oral rotavirus (RV) vaccines used worldwide are most effective in reducing diarrheal hospitalizations from RV in high income countries and least effective in low income countries where RV remains a prime cause of death in children. Research has failed to fully explain the reason for this difference of efficacy for RV vaccines, an observation made with other live oral vaccines for polio, cholera and typhoid fever. Use of parenteral vaccines have been successful in overcoming this problem for both polio and typhoid and par enteral RV vaccines are now in development. This approach should be pursued for rotavirus vaccine as well because in low income countries where oral RV vaccines have been introduced and are only partially effective, RV remains the most common cause of diarrhea in children under 5 years. The ultimate control of RV diarrheal will likely require both oral and parenteral vaccines. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The on-going agenda for global malaria elimination will require the development of additional disease control and prevention measures since currently available tools are showing signs of inadequacy. Malaria vaccines are seen as one such important addition to the control arsenal since vaccines have proven to be highly effective public health tools against important human diseases. Both cell-mediated and antibody responses are generally believed to be important for malaria parasite control, although the exact targets of T and B cell responses against malaria have not been clearly defined. However, our current understanding of the immune response to malaria suggests that T cell responses against multiple antigenic targets may potentially be key for the development of a highly efficacious malaria vaccine. This review takes a comprehensive look at the available literature on T cell-mediated immunity against all human stages of the malaria parasite and the effect of antigen diversity on these responses. The implications of these interrelationships for the development of an effective vaccine for malaria are also highlighted. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction: SYSVAC is an online bibliographic database of systematic reviews and systematic review protocols on vaccines and immunisation compiled by the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and hosted by the World Health Organization (WHO) through their National Immunization Technical Advisory Groups (NITAG) resource centre (www.nitag-resource.org). Here the development of the database and a bibliometric review of its content is presented, describing trends in the publication of policy-relevant systematic reviews on vaccines and immunisation from 2008 to 2016.
   Materials and methods: Searches were conducted in seven scientific databases according to a standardized search protocol, initially in 2014 with the most recent update in January 2017. Abstracts and titles were screened according to specific inclusion criteria. All included publications were coded into relevant categories based on a standardized protocol and subsequently analysed to look at trends in time, topic, area of focus, population and geographic location.
   Results: After screening for inclusion criteria, 1285 systematic reviews were included in the database. While in 2008 there were only 34 systematic reviews on a vaccine-related topic, this increased to 322 in 2016. The most frequent pathogens/diseases studied were influenza, human papillomavirus and pneumococcus. There were several areas of duplication and overlap.
   Discussion: As more systematic reviews are published it becomes increasingly time-consuming for decision-makers to identify relevant information among the ever-increasing volume available. The risk of duplication also increases, particularly given the current lack of coordination of systematic reviews on vaccine-related questions, both in terms of their commissioning and their execution. The SYSVAC database offers an accessible catalogue of vaccine-relevant systematic reviews with, where possible access or a link to the full-text.
   Conclusions: SYSVAC provides a freely searchable platform to identify existing vaccine-policy-relevant systematic reviews. Systematic reviews will need to be assessed adequately for each specific question and quality. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

   IDENTIFICATION
AB The end goal of HIV vaccine designing requires novel strategies to elicit a strong humoral and cell mediated immune response. The emergence of drug resistance and the requirement of next line treatment necessitate the finding of the potential and immunogenic vaccine candidate. This study employed a novel immunoinformatics approach to design multi-epitope subunit vaccine against HIV infection. Here, we designed the subunit vaccine by the combination of CTL, HTL and BCL epitopes along with suitable adjuvant and linkers. Physiochemical characterization of subunit vaccine was assessed to ensure its thermostability, theoretical PI, and amphipathic behavior. In further assessment, subunit vaccine was found to be immunogenic with the capability to generate humoral and cell-mediated immune response. Further, homology modeling and refinement was performed and the refined modeled structure was used for molecular docking with the immune receptor (TLR-3) present on lymphocyte cells. Consequently, molecular dynamics simulation ensured the molecular interaction between TLR-3 and subunit vaccine candidate. Disulfide engineering was performed by placing the cysteine residues in the region of high mobility to enhance the vaccine stability. At last, in silico cloning was performed to warrant the translational efficiency and microbial expression of the designed vaccine. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major public health problem despite effectual direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) therapy. Development of a prophylactic vaccine is essential to block spread of HCV infection. The HBV small surface antigen (HBsAg-S) can self-assemble into virus-like particles (VLPs), has higher immunogenicity and is used as a vaccine against HBV infections. Chimeric HBsAg-S proteins with foreign epitopes allow VLP formation and induce the specific humoral and cellular immune responses against the foreign proteins. In this study, we investigated the immune responses induced by chimeric VLPs with HCV neutralizing epitopes and HBV S antigen in mice. The chimeric HCV-HBV VLPs expressing neutralizing epitopes were prepared and purified. BALB/c mice were immunized with purified chimeric VLPs and the serum neutralizing antibodies were analyzed. We found that these chimeric VLPs induced neutralizing antibodies against HCV in mice. Additionally, the murine serum neutralized infections with HCV pseudoparticles and cell-cultured viruses derived from different heterologous 1a, 1b and 2a genotypes. We also found that immunization with chimeric VLPs induced anti-HBsAg antibodies. This study provides a novel strategy for development of a HCV prophylactic neutralizing epitope vaccine and a HCV-HBV bivalent prophylactic vaccine. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO VACCINE
LA English
DT Article
DE Diphtheria; Tetanus; Pertussis; Antibody persistence
AB Background: In a prospective, randomized pivotal phase III clinical trial, the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of a tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap) and a tetanus-diphtheria vaccine (Td) vaccine were studied in participants aged 11-64 years. Here we report antibody persistence through 10 years after vaccination.
   Methods: Participants who received Tdap or Td in the original phase Ill trial and provided pre- and post vaccination serum samples were recruited to donate sera at 1, 3, 5 and 10 years post-vaccination. Antibody concentrations were measured using standard assay techniques.
   Results: Initially, 1457 Tdap and 1152 Td recipients were included; of these, 175 persons from Tdap group were available at the final study bleed point. Nearly all adolescents in both groups had diphtheria antibody levels >= 0.1 IU/mL 1 month after vaccination, which were maintained in >= 95% of vaccinees at 5 and 10 years. Among adults, >= 94% had diphtheria antibody levels >= 0.1 IU/mL 1 month after vaccination, which were maintained in >= 80% at 5 and 10 years. Nearly all participants had tetanus antibodies >= 0.1 IU/mL throughout the study. PT antibodies declined to pre-vaccination levels approximately 5 years post vaccination; FHA, PRN and FIM antibodies waned at 5 and 10 years but remained several-fold higher than pre-vaccination levels.
   Conclusions: Tdap and Td provide long-lasting protective immune responses against diphtheria and tetanus. Pertussis antibodies following Tdap generally exceeded pre-vaccination levels throughout the study, but showed substantial waning.

AB Background: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination has decreased the prevalence of chronic HBV infections and their sequelae. However, whether vaccination at birth provides lifelong protection is unclear.
   Objective: To assess long-term immunity following neonatal HBV immunization in a large population based cohort.
   Methods: Using the database of a 2 million member sick fund in Israel, we identified all subjects born after introduction of universal HBV vaccination in Israel (January 1992 through December 2014), that were tested for hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs Ab's). Years since vaccination were categorized into 5-year groups and linear trends in the seroprevalence of HBV immunity were calculated. Anamnestic response and presence of Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBs Ag) were assessed.
   Results: Included were 20,634 tested individuals. Mean (+/- SD) age at testing was 14.8 (+/- 5.4) years. Mean anti-HBs Ab levels declined with time to 1639 mIU/ml in the 15-20 year group (P < 0.001). The proportion of negative results increased gradually (P < 0.001) to 66.7% after 15 years. Anamnestic response assessment showed that 604 of 644 seronegative subjects (93.8%, 95% CI: 91.6-95.5%) became seropositive after a booster dose. HBs Ag was identified in 91 of the 20,634 (4.4 per 1000 study participants).
   Conclusions: Following vaccination, anti-HB's Ab's progressively decline, with only a third of the population retaining protective levels after 15 years. In adolescence, anamnestic response shows that nearly all revaccinated adolescents exhibit immunity. A low rate of Hepatitis B infection was demonstrated despite vaccination of nearly all newborns.

AB An effective therapeutic vaccination strategy is required for controlling visceral leishmaniasis (VL), a fatal systemic disease, through boosting the immunosuppressed state in Leishmania-infected individuals, as the majority of them living in the endemic regions exhibit either subclinical or asymptomatic infection which further often develops into a full-blown disease. Previously in our laboratory, several Th1 stimulatory recombinant proteins were successfully cloned, purified and assessed for their prophylactic efficacy against Leishmania challenge. Due to their immunostimulatory property, these proteins are needed to be evaluated for their immunotherapeutic potential in Leishmania-infected hamsters. Four proteins namely, aldolase, enolase, p45 and triose phosphate isomerase were taken up to immunize animals at different doses (50, 25 and 12.5 mu g/animal). Immunization with lower doses of aldolase and enolase, i.e., 25 and 12.5 mu g showed a significant decline (similar to 60%) in parasitic load along with an enhanced cellular immune response. These findings indicate that vaccination with above-stated Th1 stimulatory proteins is an effective immunotherapeutic approach against experimental VL. However, their efficacies may further be improved in combination with known therapeutic regimens or immunomodulators. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Aim: To evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of a reduced antigen diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis-inactivated poliovirus (dTap-IPVB) vaccine (Boostrix-IPV, GSK) as a pre-school booster in 3-4 year old children as compared to dTap-IPVR (Repevax, Sanofi Pasteur), when co-administered with mumps-measles-rubella vaccine (MMRV).
   Methods: This phase III, open label, randomised study was conducted in the UK between April 2011 and April 2012. Children due their pre-school dTap-IPV booster vaccination were randomised 2:1 to receive one of two different dTap-IPV vaccines (dTap-IPVB or dTap-IPVR) with blood sample for immunogenicity assessment just prior and one month after vaccination. Immune responses to diphtheria, tetanus and polio antigens were compared between the study vaccines (inferential comparison). In the absence of an accepted pertussis correlate of protection, the immunogenicity of dTap-IPVB vaccine against pertussis was compared with historical pertussis efficacy data (inferential comparison). Safety and reactogenicity of both study vaccines were evaluated.
   Results: 387 children were randomised and 385 vaccinated: 255 in the dTap-IPVB group and 130 in the dTap-IPVB group. Prior to vaccination, >= 76.8% of children had anti-diphtheria and >= 65.5% had anti tetanus titres above the protection threshold; for pertussis, the pre-vaccination seropositivity rate ranged between 18.1 and 70.6%. Both vaccines were immunogenic with 99.2-100% of children achieving titres above the pre-specified seroprotection/seropositivity thresholds. One serious adverse event not considered as causally related to the study vaccination by the study investigator was reported in the dTap-IPVB group.
   Conclusion: Non-inferiority of dTap-IPVB to dTap-IPVB was demonstrated. Both vaccines had a clinically acceptable safety and reactogenicity profile when co-administered with MMRV to children 3-4 years old. (C) 2018 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) can cause chronic HBV infection, which may lead to advanced cirrhosis and liver cancer. Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at risk HBV infection as an occupational hazard. Hepatitis B vaccination of HCWs is recommended by WHO, but the status of hepatitis B vaccination among HCWs in China is seldom reported.
   Methodology: We conducted a cross-sectional study in 22 hospitals of 3 developed cities in China. We interviewed managers in infectious diseases and occupational health departments, and at least 40 HCWs per hospital.
   Results: We interviewed 929 HCWs; 80.8% were vaccinated against hepatitis B and 96.7% were willing to be vaccinated; 38.2% of HCWs reported having at least one needle stick or sharps injury. Three hospitals provide free hepatitis B vaccination for HCWs; hospitals with a hepatitis B vaccination policy, more HCWs reported being vaccinated (91.7% vs 79.0%, P < 0.001). HCWs in high risk departments (P = 0.011), with more knowledge of hepatitis B vaccine (P < 0.001), and with fewer working years (P = 0.002) were more likely to be vaccinated against HBV. Infectious diseases and occupational health managers had positive attitudes towards hepatitis B vaccination.
   Conclusions: Hepatitis B vaccination was well accepted among HCWs. Hospital provision of free vaccine, greater HCW knowledge of HBV, and working in higher-risk settings were associated with being vaccinated. A national policy of offering hepatitis B vaccine to HCWs should be considered in China. Provision of free hepatitis B vaccine for HBsAb negative HCWs may be acceptable. Education about HBV and hepatitis B vaccine may help promote policy implementation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Haiti has historically vaccinated between 100,000 and 300,000 dogs annually against rabies, however national authorities have not been able to reach and maintain the 70% coverage required to eliminate the canine rabies virus variant. Haiti conducts massive dog vaccination campaigns on an annual basis and utilizes both central point and door-to-door methods. These methods require that dog owners are aware of the dates and locations of the campaign. To improve this awareness among dog owners, 600,000 text messages were sent to phones in two Haitian communes (Gonaives and Saint-Marc) to remind dog owners to attend the campaign. Text messages were delivered on the second day and at the mid-point of the campaign. A post-campaign household survey was conducted to assess dog owner's perception of the text messages and the impact on their participation in the vaccination campaign. Overall, 147 of 160 (91.9%) text-receiving dog owners indicated the text was helpful, and 162 of 187 (86.6%) responding dog owners said they would like to receive text reminders during future rabies vaccination campaigns. In areas hosting one-day central point campaigns, dog owners who received the text were 2.0 (95% CI 1.1, 3,6) times more likely to have participated in the campaign (73.1% attendance among those who received the text vs 36.4% among those who did not). In areas incorporating door-to-door vaccination over multiple days there was no significant difference in participation between dog owners who did and did not receive a text. Text message reminders were well-received and significantly improved campaign attendance, indicating that short message service (SMS) alerts may be a successful strategy in low resource areas with large free roaming dog populations.

AB Edwardsiella tarda has become one of the most severe fish pathogens throughout the world. Thus, studies on the design and production of highly protective vaccines against this pathogen, as well as the mechanisms of vaccine-induced disease resistance are urgently needed. In this study, the NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) of E. tarda was recombinantly expressed and flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) anti-rIDH serum was prepared. Also, the outer membrane proteins (OMPs) of E. tarda were extracted and analyzed by western blotting. The results showed that flounder anti-rIDH serum could specifically recognize a 44 kDa protein of E. tarda OMPs, which was identified to be the native IDH of E. tarda by mass spectrometric. Consistently, immunogold electron microscopy showed that IDH could be detected on the membrane of E. tarda. Then, the vaccine potential of rIDH was tested in a flounder model, and the results showed that rIDH produced a relative percent survival (RPS) of 73.3%, which was significantly higher than that produced by formalin killed E. tarda cells. Immunological analysis showed that rIDH could induce the proliferation of rIDH-specific slg+ lymphocytes, which resulted in the production of anti-E. tarda antibodies. Accordingly, serum bactericidal activity assay showed that the serum of rIDH vaccinated fish exhibited the highest bactericidal activity compared with other groups. qRT-PCR analysis showed that rIDH could enhance the expressions of IFN-gamma, NKEF, IL-6, MHCI alpha, CD4-1 and CD8 alpha. Moreover, the bacterial burden was also detected in vaccinated fish after challenge, which showed that the number of E. tarda cells in spleen of rIDH group was significantly lower than other groups. All these results suggested that rIDH is a promising vaccine candidate against E. tarda infection. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: The dengue vaccination era began when Dengvaxia (CYD-TDV) became available in 2016. In addition, several second-generation vaccine candidates are currently in phase 3 trials, suggesting that a broader availability of dengue vaccines may be possible in the near future. Advancing on the recent WHO-SAGE recommendations for the safe and effective use of CYD-TDV at the regional level on average, this study investigates the vaccination impacts and cost-effectiveness of CYD-TDV and of a hypothetical new vaccine candidate (NVC) in a country-specific manner for three endemic countries: Vietnam, Thailand, and Colombia.
   Methods: The vaccination impacts of CYD-TDV and NVC were derived by fitting the empirical seroprevalence rates of 9 year olds into an individual-based meta-population transmission model, previously used for the WHO-SAGE working group. The disability-adjusted life years were estimated by applying country specific parametric values. The cost-effectiveness analyses of four intervention strategies in combination with routine and catch-up campaigns were compared for both vaccines to inform decision makers regarding the most suitable immunization program in each of the three countries.
   Results and conclusion: Both CYD-TDV and NVC could be cost-effective at the DALY threshold cost of $2000 depending upon vaccination costs. With CYD-TDV, targeting 9 year olds in routine vaccination programs and 10-29 year olds as a one-off catch-up campaign was the most cost-effective strategy in all three countries. With NVC, while the most cost-effective strategy was to vaccinate 9-29 and 9-18 year olds in Vietnam and Thailand respectively, vaccinating younger age cohorts between 1 and 5 years old in Colombia was more cost-effective than other strategies. Given that three countries will soon face decisions regarding whether and how to incorporate CYD-TDV or future dengue vaccines into their budget constrained national immunization programs, the current study outcomes can be used to help decision makers understand the expected impacts and cost-effectiveness of such vaccines.

AB Background: Individuals with functional or anatomic asplenia are at high risk for meningococcal disease. We evaluated the immunogenicity and safety of 1 and 2 doses of the quadrivalent meningococcal serogroups A, C, W, Y tetanus toxoid-conjugate vaccine (MenACWY-TT) in this high-risk population.
   Methods: This phase III, open-label, controlled, non-randomized study (NCT01641042) enrolled 1-17 year -olds with impaired splenic activity (high-risk group) and age-matched healthy controls (control group). We measured immune responses to MenACWY-TT by serum bactericidal activity assays using rabbit (rSBA) and human (hSBA) complement and in terms of antibodies against polysaccharides of the 4 vaccine serogroups. We evaluated vaccine response rates (VRRs) as 4-fold increases from pre vaccination levels or titers >= 1:32 (rSBA)/>= 1:8 (hSBA). We recorded solicited and unsolicited adverse events (AEs) during 4 and 31 days post-vaccination, and serious AEs (SAES) and new onset of chronic illnesses (NOCIs) throughout the study.
   Results: The according-to-protocol cohort for immunogenicity included 40 participants per group. In both groups, the first MenACWY-TT dose induced rSBA VRRs of 92.5-100% and hSBA VRRs of 55.6-77.1% across vaccine serogroups. Following the second MenACWY-TT dose, all participants had high responses, with rSBA and hSBA VRRs of 73.0-100% across vaccine serogroups. rSBA and hSBA geometric mean titers for each serogroup increased in both groups (with different magnitudes, but >= 13.1-fold) compared with baseline levels. Polysaccharide antibody concentrations >2.0 mu g/ml were detected in >= 84.4% of participants and were similar between groups. Incidences of solicited and unsolicited AEs were comparable between groups. We recorded SAES in 4/43 participants in the high-risk group and 1/43 participants in the control group (none vaccine-related). No NOCIs were reported.
   Conclusion: In this descriptive study, MenACWY-TT induced similar functional and humoral immune responses and had a clinically acceptable safety profile in children and adolescents with impaired splenic activity and in healthy controls.

TI Official batch control of influenza vaccines: Is it still useful?
SO VACCINE
LA English
DT Article
DE Influenza vaccination; EDQM; OCABR network; Official control authority
   batch release; Paul-Ehrlich-lnstitut
AB Introduction: The governmental quality control of human vaccines is a long established tradition in many European countries. In Germany, vaccines have been controlled by a governmental agency since 1935. In the beginning, vaccine production and control was a purely national activity. However, that changed fundamentally in 1994 when the so-called Official Control Authority Batch Release Network (OCABR) was implemented shortly after the establishment of the European Union. Today, Official Medicinal Control Laboratories (OMCLs) are part of the European OCABR Network. In many European countries, OMCLs experimentally test every batch of human vaccines before they enter the market. We wanted to gain insights into the benefits of batch release by the Network and address the question whether batch release is still useful. This question was investigated in the context of influenza vaccines.
   Methods: Notifications on influenza vaccines circulated from 2006 to 2016 within the OCABR network were compiled and organized into 32 cases. The impact of these findings was evaluated, and the communication pathways between companies and respective European control laboratories were examined.
   Results: Approximately 5850 batches were tested by the OMCL network between 2006 and 2016. Among these, notifications belonging to 32 cases were observed. The predominant proportion of the circulated notifications related to manufacturing issues. In most cases, the manufacturer itself had withdrawn the batches before they entered the market. However, in three cases, batches of insufficient quality were detected by the respective European Control Laboratory leading to withdrawal of 13 batches.
   Conclusion: 13 batches which did not meet the specifications of influenza vaccine were detected by the OMCL network between 2006 and 2016 which would not have been identified by the manufacturer. This demonstrates the impact of governmental batch release. Together with the intrinsic values of the OCABR system and keeping in mind that vaccines are given to healthy often young individuals, governmental batch release of influenza vaccines is still justified.

AB Background: Vaccination against herpes zoster was introduced in the United Kingdom in 2013 for individuals aged 70 years, with a phased catch-up campaign for 71-79 year olds. Vaccine introduction has resulted in a marked fall in incident herpes zoster and in post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), but formal evaluation of vaccine effectiveness is needed.
   Methods: In a population-based cohort study of older individuals born between 1933 and 1946, we used linked UK anonymised primary care health records for the first three years of the vaccination programme (01/09/2013-31/08/2016) and multivariable Poisson regression to obtain incidence rates and vaccine effectiveness (VE) against zoster and PHN.
   Results: Among 516,547 individuals, 21% were vaccinated. Incidence of zoster was 3.15/1000 person years in vaccinees and 8.80/1000 person-years in unvaccinated individuals. After adjustment, VE was 64% (95%CI = 60-68%) against incident zoster and 81% (95%Cl = 61-91%) against PHN, with very similar VE estimates in the routine and catch-up cohorts. VE against zoster was lower in those with a previous history of zoster: 47% (95%Cl = 31-58%) versus 64% (95%Cl = 60-68%) in those without previous zoster. There was evidence of waning VE over time, from 69% (95%CI = 65-74%) in the first year after vaccination to 45% (95%CI = 29-57%) by the third year.
   Conclusion: This first formal assessment of VE in the UK zoster vaccination programme demonstrates good effectiveness of zoster vaccine, and very good protection against PHN. The findings provide evidence that VE is similar across the age groups targeted for vaccination in the UK, and on duration of protection of the vaccine in public health use. The study provides key information for decision-makers about the future direction of UK zoster vaccination programme, indicating that the live zoster vaccine may be more cost-effective than estimated previously. It also supports efforts to communicate the benefits of zoster vaccination to address the declining coverage observed across the UK. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Immunogenicity and safety of a newly developed liquid DTwP-Hib/HepB-IPV hexavalent vaccine (EasySix(TM)) was evaluated and compared with administration of commercially licensed Pentavac SD (R) (DTwP-HepB/Hib) and Imovax Polio((R)) vaccine in an open-label, randomized multi-centric trial. 284 participants, aged 6-10 weeks, randomized in a 1:1 allocation, received three doses of test or comparator vaccines, administered 4 weeks apart. Immunogenicity of the vaccines was determined by measuring the baseline and post-vaccination antibody responses and comparing the proportions of subjects achieving seroprotection against the vaccine antigens; safety was evaluated in terms of solicited (local and systemic) and unsolicited incidences in the follow up phase. Post-vaccination, seroprotection was achieved against all six vaccine antigens in both vaccine groups. The seroresponse rate as well as geometric mean titers of antibody for all vaccine components were comparable between EasySix (TM) and Pentavac SD (R)-Imovax Polio((R)) group. Both vaccines had similar reactogenicity profiles and were well tolerated; all adverse events resolved completely without any sequelae. Only one serious adverse event was reported that completely resolved; it was regarded unconnected to the vaccine administered. This study demonstrated that immunogenicity and safety profiles of EasySix (TM) vaccine, manufactured by Panacea Biotec Ltd, are non-inferior to the commercially available vaccines.

AB The design and optimization of gas heater in supercritical carbon dioxide Rankine cycles faces some challenges, among which an urgent one is the effect of thermal boundary condition on the performance of gas heater. This work focused on performance comparison and effects of major operating parameters under two most common thermal boundary conditions regarding to low-grade heat sources, by employing a modified Shear-Stress Transport model where a variable turbulent Prandtl formulation was incorporated. Results show that in the pseudo-critical region thermal boundary condition obviously affected the performance of supercritical carbon dioxide gas heater. Compared with the uniform heat flux condition, at convective boundary condition impair. ment occurred in both the local enhancement at high mass flux and local deterioration at low mass flux, due to the self-regulation in local heat input. A nearly uniform thermal field under convective boundary condition was achieved by increasing the mass flux of heat source fluid, while increasing the inlet temperature of source fluid was ineffective to that end. Opposite to constant-property fluid heater, flow arrangement dramatically affected axial profiles of local heat transfer coefficient while had a much weaker effect on local heat flux in supercritical gas heater. Temperature distribution of supercritical carbon dioxide along the heater was insensitive to the flow arrangement. Further studies reveal that thermal boundary effect was closely related to the buoyancy effect. Thennal boundary condition has a minimal effect on heat transfer of supercritical carbon dioxide when buoyancy effect is negligible. Under heavy influence of buoyancy, thermal boundary effect was obvious in the form of much weaker local deterioration under convective boundary. Finally, the Jackson Nusselt correlation was found applicable to the prediction of overall heat transfer rate under convective boundary condition, with relative deviations within 15%.

AB Experimental investigations have been carried out to identify an appropriate concentration of paraffin wax in paraffin wax-water nanoemulsions, for use as thermal energy storage media. For this purpose, paraffin wax water nanoemulsions containing different concentrations of paraffin wax (10 wt%, 20 wt%, 33 wt% and 50 wt%) were prepared, with the size of dispersed phase ranging between 200 and 600 nm. Specific heat of nanoemulsions increased with paraffin wax concentration, with 50% paraffin wax-water nanoemulsion possessing 47% higher specific heat than that of water. The variation of viscosity of paraffin wax-emulsions was similar to that of pure liquid, with a reduction in viscosity at elevated temperatures. The performances of paraffin wax-water emulsions and those of water and pure paraffin wax were evaluated during charging cycle of thermal energy storage in an experimental setup. The experiments revealed that the energy stored per unit time per unit heat exchanger volume was the highest for paraffin wax-water emulsion containing 10% paraffin wax, exceeding those of water and pure paraffin wax by 11% and 23% respectively.

AB The structure chamber of rotary engine is irregular compared with traditional reciprocating engines. Pure n-butanol rotary engine normally encounters partial burning and even misfire at idling and lean conditions. Comparatively, hydrogen supplement can ameliorate performance of original engine. In this paper, experimentation of a rotary engine fueled with pure n-butanol and hydrogen/n-butanol blends at idling and different excess air ratios was conducted. Experimental results manifested that hydrogen addition effectively decreased the engine instability and fuel energy flow rate. To be specific, fuel energy flow rate at the excess air ratio of 1.05 was reduced from 23.63 MJ/h to 21.26 MJ/h when 3% hydrogen was added. Combustion duration was lowered after introducing hydrogen. Maximum chamber temperature was heightened after hydrogen addition. HC and CO emissions were reduced when 3% hydrogen was added. NOx emissions were reduced when the mixture was leaned out.

AB In this paper, we report economic feasibility studies focusing on profitability analysis of high pressure polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) water electrolysis for distributed H-2 refueling stations in Korea. From capital and operating costs, a unit H-2 production cost of 6.24 $ kgH(2)(-1) was obtained for a H-2 capacity of 700 m(3) h(-1), which is equivalent to handling about 300 fuel cell electric vehicles. Based on cost estimations, profitability analysis using cash flow diagrams was performed to assess the economic feasibility of high pressure PEM water electrolysis and various key economic indicators like net present value (NPV), discounted payback period (DPBP), and present value ratio were obtained for both different discount rates and capacity factors. In conclusion, employment of high pressure PEM water electrolysis was found to be economically profitable showing reasonably high NPVs (16-52 MM$) and short DPBPs (4-7 years).

ID DESIGN
AB Piezoelectric energy harvesters (PEHs) from fluid energy sources, particularly vortex shedding-induced vibrations, have received considerable attention in recent years. However, there still exists a common problem with these harvesters: the current optimum position of a vortex shedding-induced PEH located in the wake of a bluff body is commonly obtained through a series of experiments. This study proposes a theoretical model to determine the best position and demonstrate this mechanism. This theoretical model, which consists of fluid-structure and electromechanical couplings, is derived from the proposed PEH with a flapping sheet structure. The equivalent harmonic force in the fluid-structure coupling part caused by the vortexes on the flapping sheet is expressed by Bernoulli's law and Lamb-Oseen vortex model. The system equations in the electro-mechanical coupling part are then obtained utilizing Euler-Bernoulli beam theory and an equivalent circuit model. This model was validated initially through the published data in the reference and then through the experimental results from a proposed PEH prototype. The optimum position of the PEH in the flow field is revealed by the analytical solution in numerical results and examined in experimental results. Moreover, the balanced match of fluid velocity and bluff body diameter can also contribute to the high-level system performance under the optimal load resistance.

AB The aim of this study is to investigate the payback period and the payback-period reduction of the organic Rankine cycle (ORC) with mixtures for waste heat recovery from the exhaust gas of a large marine diesel engine. Working fluids with zero-ozone-depletion potential, such as R236fa, R245fa, 8600, R1234ze, and their mixtures, are selected to analyze the economic and thermodynamic performances in the conversion cycle. The optimal mass fractions of the mixed working fluids R236fa/R245fa, R236fa/R1234ze, and R600/R1234ze for the lowest payback period with the corresponding optimal expander inlet temperature and condenser outlet temperature of the ORC have been obtained. R600/R1234ze possesses the best performance in terms of payback period. Under optimal conditions, the payback period of the ORC with R600/R1234ze is the lowest and is shorter than that with R236fa, R245fa, MOO, R1234ze, R236fa/R245fa, and R236fa/R1234ze by 7.55%, 6.47%, 9%, 9.17%, 0.9%, and 2.88%, respectively. To evaluate the economic potential of mixed working fluids using different types of expander such as turbine, scroll, and screw expanders properly, the relationships between the isentropic efficiencies of the expander and their corresponding optimal expander inlet temperature and optimal mass fraction are obtained. Optimal correlations are proposed to conveniently predict the optimal mass fractions of the mixtures R236fa/R245fa, R236fa/R1234ze, and R600/R1234ze in the ORC and to assess the reduction of their payback periods for the waste heat recovery of a large marine diesel engine. The results highlight the significant potential of the mixtures used in the ORC for performance improvement and demonstrate the importance of mixture assessment for reducing the payback period in further work.

AB Power-to-Gas is a chemical energy storage technology based on converting electrical energy into chemical energy in the form of a certain gas, typically hydrogen or methane. The main advantage of methane, namely synthetic natural gas (SNG), is that in this way the already existing gas infrastructure can be used as transport and storage medium. This article evaluates the economic viability of SNG production from CO2 capture and utilization. As representative examples, California, Ontario, Spain, Sweden, Paraguay, Germany and India electricity markets were considered. At present, the estimated cost of SNG is 70-125 EUR/MWh, from 2 to 7 times higher than fossil natural gas. In a feasible future scenario, the costs can be reduced to 40 EUR/MWh, competing directly with the fossil fuel, especially in countries where it is mainly imported as Germany or Spain. To achieve this goal, further R&D is needed, especially on two key parameters: electrolysis efficiency and methanation capex costs. In any case, the economic viability of SNG is subject to high annual operating hours in order to return the initial investment. Therefore, the SNG process, rather than an intermittent grid storage technology, seems a promising in continuously or seasonal production, having a unique niche market among energy storage technologies.

AB This paper presents a 2-D real-time modeling approach for a proton-exchange-membrane fuel cell (PEMFC). The proposed model covers multi-physical domains for both fluidic and electrochemical features, which considers in particular the flow field geometric form of fuel cell. The characteristics of reactant gas convection in the serpentine gas pipeline and diffusion phenomenon through the gas diffusion layer (GDL) are thoroughly considered in fluidic domain model. In addition, a three levels iterative solver is developed in order to accurately calculate the implicit spatial physical quantities distribution in electrochemical domain. Moreover, the proposed 2-D real-time modeling approach uses a numerical method to achieve a fast execution time, and can thus be further easily applied to any real-time control implementation or online diagnostic system. After experimental validation under different fuel cell operating conditions, an iterative Least Angle Regression (LAR) method is used to efficiently and accurately perform the global parameters sensitivity analysis based on Sobol definition. The online analysis results give an insight into the influences of modeling parameters on fuel cell performance. The effect of interactions between parameters' sensitivities is especially investigated, which can provide useful information for degradation understanding, parameters tuning, re-calibration of the parameters and online prognostic.

AB Using evolutionary computation, we empirically investigate convergence properties of Gaussian process based Bayesian optimization (BO). We use evolutionary computation for the learning of the prediction model and optimization of the acquisition function (auxiliary search) of BO. For practical use for materials informatics, we address three issues in BO: (1) the stopping conditions, (2) the initial data size, and (3) the unknown smoothness of the target function. Then, we introduce a goal-directed acquisition function in which a target value as a desired property of a compound is incorporated. In addition, we present an ensemble method of BO, in which each BO in the ensemble has a random property and a kernel function with a different smoothness. Experimental results for the materials data sets on melting points of binary compounds and hydrogen weight percentages of hydrogen storage materials with two to four constituent elements show the effectiveness of the ensemble method of BO. Additionally, using an ensemble of BOs presents that the obtained results (increase of the number of samples acquired) are not simply a result of additional BOs. The goal-directed acquisition function and the ensemble of BOs which we propose should be techniques that can be used in the realization of a new materials recommendation system with a self-learning algorithm. Due to the self-learning algorithm realized by BO, the property prediction performance of the algorithm would be increasingly improved. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   regularization; Similarity preservation
AB Recent research indicates the critical importance of preserving local geometric structure of data in unsupervised feature selection (UFS), and the well studied graph Laplacian is usually deployed to capture this property. By using a squared l(2)-norm, we observe that conventional graph Laplacian is sensitive to noisy data, leading to unsatisfying data processing performance. To address this issue, we propose a unified UFS framework via feature self-representation and robust graph regularization, with the aim at reducing the sensitivity to outliers from the following two aspects: i) an l(2), (1)-norm is used to characterize the feature representation residual matrix; and ii) an l(1)-norm based graph Laplacian regularization term is adopted to preserve the local geometric structure of data. By this way, the proposed framework is able to reduce the effect of noisy data on feature selection. Furthermore, the proposed l(1)-norm based graph Laplacian is readily extendible, which can be easily integrated into other UFS methods and machine learning tasks with local geometrical structure of data being preserved. As demonstrated on ten challenging benchmark data sets, our algorithm significantly and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art UFS methods in the literature, suggesting the effectiveness of the proposed UFS framework.

AB Optimization in dynamic environments is a fast developing research area. Several outstanding meta heuristic algorithms were proposed to solve dynamic optimization problems (DOPs) in the past decade. However, most of the effort is devoted to real-valued DOPs. Although, great majority of real-life problems has discrete and binary spaces, research in binary DOPs is still lacking. Accordingly, the present study introduces the first binary DOP application of Weighted Superposition Attraction Algorithm (WSA), which is a new generation swarm intelligence-based metaheuristic algorithm. As a distinctive feature from the existing literature, the introduced binary version of WSA (bWSA) does not require transfer functions for converting floating numbers to binary, whereas they are commonly employed in binary modifications of various metaheuristic algorithms. Additionally, some new extensions of bWSA are also developed in the present study. For comparative analysis, first, some state-of-the-art algorithms including Particle Swarm Optimization and Genetic Algorithm are adopted. As secondarily, another new-generation hot optimizer, namely, Firefly Algorithm (FA), which has already been shown to be quite promising in DOPs, is employed in the present work. Moreover, all algorithms implemented here are enhanced by using dualism based search, triggered random immigrants and adaptive hill climbing strategies. Dynamic modifications of the well-known binary benchmarking problems such as One-Max, Plateau, Royal Road and Deceptive Functions are used in the computational study. Performances of the proposed algorithms are compared in detail. Finally, non-parametric statistical tests are employed to validate the results. Findings point out superiority of bWSA in binary DOPs.

AB In this paper, we propose a Generalised-Fuzzy-TOPSIS method as a versatile evaluation model. The model is suitable for different types of fuzzy or interval-valued numbers, with or without subjective weights of criteria being defined by evaluators. Additionally, we extend the final ranking step of the TOPSIS method, which is the calculation of closeness coefficient based on the separation from Negative Ideal Solution (NIS) and proximity to Positive Ideal Solution (PIS). Experiments show that with the same focus on PIS and NIS distances, our proposed ranking is identical to TOPSIS, and also performs very well when varying the distance weights. The applicability of the proposed method is demonstrated with relevant examples of technology and material selection in the context of additive manufacturing. Sensitivity analyses, based on subjective weights of criteria, degree of optimism, evaluators' weights in group decision making, and distance weights, are presented to assist managers in making more informed decisions.

AB In many real managerial applications, an issue of considerable importance is allocating a total fixed cost across a set of competing decision making units (DMUs). The fixed cost allocation problem has also become one of the most important applications of the data envelopment analysis (DEA) methodology. In this paper, we will approach the fixed cost allocation problem by explicitly considering both competition and cooperation relationships among DMUs. To this end, we integrate cooperative game theory and the cross efficiency method to develop a DEA-game cross efficiency approach to generate a unique and fair allocation plan. With the proposed approach, each DMU is considered as a player and a super-additive characteristic function is defined for coalitions of DMUs. Then, the Shapley value is calculated for each DIM and accordingly associated common weights are optimized to determine the final allocation plan. Since the cross efficiency method considers peer appraisal and the cooperative game theory allows for equitable negotiations, all DMUs are supposed to reach a consensus on the equitable allocation scheme through our novel approach. From this perspective, our proposed approach is promising and attractive for allocating a fixed cost in large organizations. Finally, the DEA-game cross efficiency approach is demonstrated with a numerical example derived from previous literature and the results are compared to some existing methods. Additionally, we apply the proposed approach to an empirical application concerning city commercial bank activities in China. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Traditional electromyogram (EMG) pattern recognition does not take into account the effect of confounding factors, preventing its effective clinical application. In this paper, we investigated EMG pattern recognition of compound confounding factors including electrode shift, force variation, limb posture and temporary drift. We started with feature extraction, to identify suitable representations to resolve classification degradation caused by electrode doffing. Then, we proceeded to examine a variety of classifiers, to achieve a favorable classification accuracy (CA) when switching the control arms (dominant and nondominant) without additional calibration. Lastly, we investigated adaptive learning strategies, to mitigate the decline in CA over a relatively long duration (one day) of use. Two data-collection protocols (electrode doffing and donning, and one-day-long collection) were applied, and EMG datasets collected in these two protocols were arranged into three scenarios for progressive validation of the features, classifiers, and adaptive learning methods. Our results showed that the features extracted from the frequency domain improved the CA by 30% in comparison with their original time-domain representations (14 motions, 67.5 +/- 9.8%, p < .001). When alternating the control arms, the performance achieved by the classifiers all declined and no method appeared to be more reliable than the others (14 motions, the best 45.5 +/- 8.4%, probabilistic neural network; 7 motions, the best 70.4 +/- 10.6%, linear discriminant analysis). At last, the new adaptive learning method utilizing representative samples could effectively mitigate classification degradation by updating the classifier's training samples in real-time.

AB One of the most important issues for the development of a motor-imagery based brain-computer interface (BCI) is how to design a powerful classifier with strong generalization capability. Extreme learning machine (ELM) has recently proven to be comparable or more efficient than support vector machine for many pattern recognition problems. In this study, we propose a multi-kernel ELM (MKELM)-based method for motor imagery electroencephalogram (EEG) classification. The kernel extension of ELM provides an elegant way to circumvent calculation of the hidden layer outputs and inherently encode it in a kernel matrix. We investigate effects of two different kernel functions (i.e., Gaussian kernel and polynomial kernel) on the performance of kernel ELM. The MKELM method is subsequently developed by integrating these two types of kernels with a multi-kernel learning strategy, which can effectively explore the supplementary information from multiple nonlinear feature spaces for more robust classification of EEG. An extensive experimental comparison with two public EEG datasets indicates that the MKELM method gives higher classification accuracy than those of the other competing algorithms. The experimental results confirm that superiority of the proposed MKELM-based method for accurate classification of EEG associated with motor imagery in BCI applications. Our method also provides a promising and generalized solution to investigate the complex and nonlinear information for various applications in the fields of expert and intelligent systems.

AB In this paper, a smart home energy management system (SHEMS) is developed using a limited memory algorithm for bound constrained problems known as L-BFGS-B, along with time-of-use (ToU) pricing to optimize appliance scheduling in a 24-h period. The allocation of energy resources for each appliance is coordinated by a smart controllable load (SCL) device embedded in the household's smart meter. SCL guarantees automation of the proposed SHEMS and prevents manual participation of customers in demand response (DR) programs. The model is simulated on a population of 247 residential prosumers with solar PV systems based on 15-min interval electric load data from a residential community in Austin, TX. After clustering households based on their electricity profiles, the proposed optimization model is performed. Simulation results show that the proposed autonomous scheduling system reduces cumulative energy consumption for customers across the different clusters. In addition, when households are grouped based on their respective category according to the ToU pricing scheme, the simulation reports a notable decrease in total energy consumption, from 65.771 kWh to 44.295 kWh, as well as a reduction in the cumulative cost of energy, from $6.550 to $4.393 per day. Simulation results confirm that the proposed algorithm effectively improves the operational efficiency of the distribution system, reduces power congestion at key times, and decreases electricity costs for prosumers.

AB In this paper, we propose a hybrid forecasting model that combines Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) with fast reduced kernel Extreme Learning Machine (KELM) for day ahead foreign currency exchange rate forecasting. EMD is an efficient method for nonlinear data decomposition in such a noisy environment and the purpose is to find important components in terms of Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) by which the nonlinear time series is converted into stationary time series by making the data smoother and simpler for analysis. The average IMPs decomposed from EMD (AEMD) are hybridized with fast KELM named as AEMD-KELM for producing a more accurate forecast. The experimental results using AEMD-KELM method for seven currency exchange rates like CAD/HKD, CAD/USD, CAD/BRL, CAD/JPY, EUR/USD, and GBP/USD provide superior prediction and trend analysis in comparison with EMD based ELM (EMD-ELM) approaches. Further currency exchange rate movement trends are used for generating trading signals like buy, sell or hold. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Personalization of wellness recommendations using contextual

AB A huge array of personalized healthcare and wellness systems are introduced into the portfolio of digital health and quantified-self movement in recent years. These systems share common capabilities including self-tracking/monitoring and self-quantifications, based on the raw sensory data. These capabilities provide solid ground for the users to be more aware of their health; however, such measures are inefficient for changing the unhealthy habits of the users. In order to induce healthy habits in the users, a system must be capable of generating context-aware personalized recommendations. The main obstacle in this regard is the contextual interpretation of recommendations based on user's current context and contextual preferences. To resolve these issues, we propose a methodology of cross-context interpretation of recommendations (CCIR) for personalized health and wellness services. The CCIR method adds additional capabilities to the traditional reasoning methods and builds advanced form of the reasoning with the incorporation of contextual factors in the process of interpretations of the recommendations. With CCIR, the self-quantification systems can be enhanced to generate personalized recommendations in addition to tracking, quantifying, and monitoring user activities. In order to validate the proposed CUR methodology, a set of 40 contextual scenarios and corresponding recommendations are presented for the evaluation collected from 40 different end users and 10 domain experts. Using chi-square test evaluation, the results demonstrated acceptable "goodness of fit" indices for the system developed on proposed CCIR methodology with respect to the end users' opinion. Also from the statistical observation, it is found that there exists a higher level agreement towards the system between the participants of both end users and experts. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This work investigated the underlying formation of acrylamide from amino acids in frying oils during high temperatures and at different times via modeling systems. Eighteen amino acids were used in order to determine which one was more effective on acrylamide production. Significantly the highest amount of acrylamide was produced from asparagine (5987.5 mu g/kg) and the lowest from phenylalanine (9.25 mu g/kg). A constant amount of asparagine and glutamine in palm olein and soy bean oils was heated up in modelling system at different temperatures (160, 180 and 200 degrees C) and times (1.5, 3, 4.5, 6, 7.5 min). The highest amount of acrylamide was found at 200 degrees C for 7.5 min (9317 and 8511 mu g/kg) and lowest at 160 degrees C for 1.5 min (156 and 254 mu g/kg) in both frying oils and both amino acids. Direct correlations have been found between time (R-2 = 0.884), temperature (R-2 = 0.951) and amount of acrylamide formation, both at p < 0.05.

AB The mucilage polysaccharides from Dioscorea opposita (DOMP) were extracted and treated with a single/dual enzymatic hydrolysis. The characterisation and viscosity were subsequently investigated in this study. DOMP obtained 62.52% mannose and 23.45% glucose. After single protease and trichloroacetic acid (TCA) treatments, the mannose content was significantly reduced to 3.96%, and glucose increased from 23.45% to 45.10%. Dual enzymatic hydrolysis also decreased the mannose and glucose contents to approximately 18%-35% and 7%-19%, respectively. The results suggest that enzymatic degradation could effectively remove the protein from DOMP accompanied by certain polysaccharides, especially mannose. The molecular weight, surface morphology, viscosity and particle sizes were measured. Enzymatic hydrolysis reduced molecular weight, decreased the viscosity, and increased the particle sizes, which indicates that the characterisations of DOMP samples were altered as structures changed. This study was a basic investigation into characterisation of DOMP to contribute to the processing of food by-products.

AB Whey acerola-flavoured drink was treated using ohmic heating (OH) at 65 degrees C for 30 min to evaluate different frequencies (10, 100 and 1000 Hz with 25 V) and voltages (45, 60 and 80 V at 60 Hz) and by conventional heating (CH) with the same temperature profile (65 degrees C/30 min). Rheology parameters, color changes (h degrees, C*,triangle E) microstructure (optical microscopy), and ascorbic acid (AA) degradation kinetics were performed. AA degradation rates ranged from 1.7 to 29.3% and from 2.8 to 24.8% for OH and CH, respectively. The beverages treated with both processes exhibited a pseudo-plastic behavior (n < 1), higher saturation (C*), lesser reddish color (h degrees), and higher color variations (triangle E*). In microstructure analysis, OH (1000 Hz-25 V and 80 V-60 Hz) was able to rupture the cell structure. The best results were observed at low frequencies and voltage OH processes on whey acerola-flavoured drinks should be performed at low frequencies and voltages (<= 100 Hz and 45 V), an alternating current (A/C). However, despite the use of inert electrodes, the existence of corrosion was not evaluated, being an important information to be investigated.

AB In this work, a sensitive method based on nanoflow liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry has been developed for the multiresidue determination of veterinary drugs residues in honey, veal muscle, egg and milk. Salting-out supported liquid extraction was employed as sample treatment for milk, veal muscle and egg, while a modified QuEChERS procedure was used in honey. The enhancement of sensitivity provided by the nanoflow LC system also allowed the implementation of high dilution factors as high as 100:1. For all matrices tested, matrix effects were negligible starting from a dilution factor of 100, enabling, thus, the use of external standard calibration instead of matrix-matched calibration of each sample, and the subsequent increase of laboratory throughput. At spiked levels as low as 0.1 or 1 mu g kg(-1) before the 1:100 dilution, the obtained signals were still significantly higher than the instrumental limit of quantitation (S/N 10).

AB Whelk has been exploited commercially as a delicacy for a long time. Although previous studies have suggested that whelk might serve as a potential rich source of long chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LC-PUFA) enriched phospholipid (PL), the molecular species profile of the PL have not been reported yet. In this study, more than 220 molecular species of glycerophospholipid (GP) belonging to eight classes including glycerophosphocholine, glycerophosphoethanolamine, glycerophosphoserine, glycerophosphoinositol, lysoglycerophosphocholine, lysoglycerophosphoethanolamine, lysoglycerophosphoserine and lysoglycerophosphoinositol in three species of edible whelks (Buccinium yokomaruae, Neptunea arthritica cumingi Cosse and Volutharpa ampullaceal) were identified for the first time by using direct infusion tandem mass spectrometric method. Most of the predominant GP molecular species contained n-3 LC-PUFA, especially eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Meanwhile, the whelk lipids contained a high proportion of PL (32.92-55.55% of total lipids) and PUFA (30.45-41.42% of total FA). Among PL, phosphatidylcholine (44.18-65.49 mol%) was dominant.

AB Aqueous extracts of orange peel and pulp with high total phenolic contents (TPC) (25.94 and 11.38 mg GAE/g extracts, respectively) were employed in the formulation of functional carrot juice and functional juices were treated using thermosonication process. In accordance with Box-Behnken design, 17 runs with 3 variables and 3 levels was applied for the optimization of the carrot juice with peel (CJPL) and pulp (CJPP) extracts. Overlaid contour plots prediction showed that the optimal conditions for CJPL were 125 mL juice volume, 6.50 min ultrasound process time and 52.78 degrees C ultrasound process temperature for maximum TPC (30.25 mg GAE/100 mL) and DPPH scavenging activity (61.22%). Sample CJPP has maximum TPC (28.94 mg GAE/100 mL) and DPPH activity (55.87%) under optimal ultrasound process conditions of 125 mL juice volume, 5.04 min and 59.99 degrees C ultrasound process time and temperature, respectively. Optimization of thermosonication showed significant improvements in the quality of functional carrot juice.

AB Enzymatic hydrolysis of soy protein isolate by Corolase PP under high hydrostatic pressure conditions was studied and the effects of hydrolysis on antioxidant and antihypertensive activities were investigated. As observed, high hydrostatic pressure (80-300 MPa) enhanced the hydrolytic efficiency of Corolase PP and decreased the surface hydrophobicity of the hydrolysates. Hydrolysates obtained at 200 MPa for 4 h had higher bioactivities (reducing power, ABTS radical-scavenging and ACE inhibitory activities). The molecular weight (MW) determination indicated that hydrolysis at high hydrostatic pressure could increase the production of small peptides (< 3 kDa) and the amino acid sequences of these peptides with different inhibitory abilities, less than 3 kDa, in hydrolysates were identified using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI TOF MS). These results indicated that high hydrostatic pressure combined with Corolase PP treatments could be used as a potential technology to produce bioactive peptides from soy protein isolate.

AB The objective of this research was to study the impact of ripening inhibitor level and type on the formation, stability, and activity of antimicrobial thyme oil nanoemulsions formed by spontaneous emulsification. Oil-inwater antimicrobial nanoemulsions (10 wt%) were formed by titrating a mixture of essential oil, ripening inhibitor, and surfactant (Tween 80) into 5mM sodium citrate buffer (pH 3.5). Stable nanoemulsions containing small droplets (d < 70 nm) were formed. The antimicrobial activity of the nanoemulsions decreased with increasing ripening inhibitor concentration which was attributed to a reduction in the amount of hydrophobic antimicrobial constituents transferred to the separated hydrophobic domain, mimicking bacterial cell membranes, by using dialysis and chromatography. The antimicrobial activity of the nanoemulsions also depended on the nature of the ripening inhibitor used: palm approximate to corn > canola > coconut which also depended on their ability to transfer hydrophobic antimicrobial constituents to the separated hydrophobic domain.

AB Beverage fraud involving counterfeiting of brand spirits is an increasing problem not only due to deception of the consumer but also because it poses health risks e. g. from possible methanol admixture. Suspicious spirit samples from Russia and Kenya were analysed using H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy in comparison to authentic products. Using linear regression analysis of spectral integral values, 4 counterfeited samples from Russia and 2 from Kenya were easily identifiable with R-2 < 0.7. Sensory analysis using triangle test methodology confirmed significant taste differences between counterfeited and authentic samples but the assessors were unable to correctly identify the counterfeited product in the majority of cases. An important conclusion is that consumers cannot assumed to be self-responsible when consuming counterfeit alcohol because there is no general ability to organoleptically detect counterfeit alcohol.

AB The presence of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in dairy products can lead to human exposure. This study investigated the behavior of OCP residues in milk during yogurt and cheese production. Gas chromatography with electron-capture detection (GC-ECD) was used to detect a-hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), gamma-HCH, G-chlordane, and alpha-chlordane in fresh milk, yogurt, and cheese. The results showed that fermentation reduced the residual concentration of OCPs in yogurt, with processing factors (PFs) ranging from 0.42 to 0.64. The reductions in residue levels during fermentation were due to the activity of the starter. The cheese making process increased the residual concentration of OCPs in cheese compared to raw milk, with PFs ranging from 2.37 to 4.93. Additionally, milk, yogurt, and cheese samples were purchased from local markets and OCP levels were analyzed. The target OCPs ranged from ND to 16.50 mu g/kg in these samples.

AB Food adulteration and fraud is driven by economic interests; it is thus necessary to establish a high-through method that allows quantitative identification of familiar animal and plant proteins for global use. In this study, a sensitive mass spectrometric approach for the detection of eight species, including pork, beef, lamb, chicken, duck, soy, peanut, and pea, is presented and the heat stability and specificity of screened peptides are verified. To improve screening efficiency of specific peptides, several key data searching parameters, including peptides, sequence lengths, sequence coverage, and unique peptides, are investigated. Using this approach, it is possible to detect a 0.5% contamination of any of the eight species. The method is proven to have high sensitivity, specificity, repeatability, and a low quantitative detection limit with respect to adulteration of diverse types of meat products.

AB This work presents a fast, sensitive and reliable multi-residue methodology based on fat and protein precipitation and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for the determination of common legal and illegal psychoactive drugs, and major metabolites, in breast milk. One-fourth of the 40 target analytes is investigated for the first time in this biological matrix. The method was validated in breast milk and also in various types of bovine milk, as tranquilizers are occasionally administered to food-producing animals. Absolute recoveries were satisfactory for 75% of the target analytes. The use of isotopically labeled compounds assisted in correcting analyte losses due to ionization suppression matrix effects (higher in whole milk than in the other investigated milk matrices) and ensured the reliability of the results. Average method limits of quantification ranged between 0.4 and 6.8 ng/mL. Application of the developed method showed the presence of caffeine in breast milk samples (12-179 ng/mL).

AB Zeins of differing sub-class composition much more readily formed visco-elastic masses in water or acetic acid solutions than equivalent kafirin preparations. Visco-elastic masses could be formed from both zein and kafirin preparations by coacervation from glacial acetic acid. Dissolving the prolamins in glacial acetic acid apparently enabled protonation and complete solvation. Stress-relaxation analysis of coacervated zein and kafirin viscoelastic masses showed they were initially soft. With storage, they became much firmer. Zein masses exhibited predominantly viscous flow properties, whereas kafirin masses were more elastic. The.-sub-class is apparently necessary for the retention of visco-elastic mass softness with kafirin and zein, and for elastic recovery of kafirin. Generally, regardless of water or acetic acid treatment, all the zein preparations had similar FTIR spectra, with greater a-helical conformation, than the kafirin preparations which were also similar to each other. Kafirin visco-elastic masses have a much higher elastic character than zein masses.

AB Pre-frying of chloride-containing raw materials (e. g., breaded frozen fish products) can lead to the formation of fatty acid esters of 2-monochloropropane-1,3-diol, 3-monochloropropane-1,2-diol (MCPD-E), and glycidol (G-E). The aim of the present study was to identify relevant parameters for the formation of these process contaminants during the pre-frying. Secondly, several mitigation approaches have been investigated.
   The major proportion of the MCPD-E and G-E in the fish products resulted from the pre-frying oil absorbed, while the temperature and the heating period of the pre-frying oil showed the strongest impact. A significant reduction of the MCPD-E content in the pre-frying oil was achieved by filtering-off solid breading particles. Additionally, the G-E content decreased resulting from the use of adsorbent materials. Moreover, the analyses of total polar material and the color intensity of the pre-frying oil are suggested as screening methods for estimating the MCPD-E and G-E contents in the fish products.

AB Bioactive peptides are oligopeptides that consist of 2-20 amino acids that can exert beneficial effects on human health in addition to basic nutritional effects. Food derived protein hydrolysates or peptides with immunomodulatory and anticancer activities have been reported from a variety of food protein sources such as milk, egg, fish, rice, soybean, pea, chlorella, spirulina, oyster and mussel. In vitro hydrolysis of food proteins using commercial proteolytic enzymes is the most commonly employed process for the production of immunomodulatory and anticancer food protein hydrolysates. The immunomodulatory and anticancer activities of food derived protein hydrolysates or peptides are related to the amino acid composition, sequence and length. Most immunomodulatory and anticancer food protein hydrolysates or peptides were tested using cell culture and animal models, while a few involved clinical trials. This review provides a comprehensive overview of immunomodulatory and anticancer food derived protein hydrolysates or peptides, their production and mechanisms of action.

AB A targeted approach using HS-SPME-GC-MS was performed to investigate volatile compounds of ordinary Valencia (VAL) and its more deeply colored mutant Rohde Red Valencia orange (RRV) at different developmental stages. Fifty-six volatile components classified into six chemical groups were quantified. The individual volatile compounds in each group were significantly influenced by the genotype and harvest date. Cluster analysis suggested two principal clusters. Cluster I included fruits of VAL and RRV harvested in July, September, and November and was characterized by the 2-ethyl-1-hexanol acetate and linalool chemotype; cluster II included fruits harvested in January and March, with the valencene/beta-myrcene chemotype. Principal component analysis confirmed that fruits of both cultivars harvested at different dates possessed a unique aroma active profile, especially, the odor-active volatile-norisoprenoids degraded from C-40 carotenoid were significantly higher in RRV than in VAL at full maturity. These results could provide information for further study of the flavor metabolism pathways in the two closely related cultivars.

AB We investigated the feasibility of qualitative food analysis using complex refractive index mapping of food materials in the terahertz (THz) frequency range. We studied optical properties such as the refractive index and absorption coefficient of food materials, including insects as foreign substances, from 0.2 to 1.3 THz. Although some food materials had a complex composition, their refractive indices were approximated with effective medium values, and therefore, they could be discriminated on the complex refractive index map. To demonstrate food quality inspection with THz imaging, we obtained THz reflective images and time-of-flight imaging of hidden defects in a sugar and milk powder matrix by using time domain THz pulses. Our results indicate that foreign substances can be clearly classified and detected according to the optical parameters of the foods and insects by using THz pulses.

AB The effect of adding alpha-tocopherol in proportions ranging from 0.002 to 5% in weight on the oxidative stability of soybean oil was studied. For the first time, the oxidation process under accelerated storage conditions including evolution of the molar percentages of the several types of oil acyl groups, and formation and evolution of various kinds of oxidation products comprising hydroperoxides, hydroxy-dienes and other alcohols, epoxides, aldehydes and keto-dienes, was followed by H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance. It is proved that, except in the lowest proportion, alpha-tocopherol not only exerts a prooxidant effect on soybean oil but also modifies its oxidation pathway, affecting the oxidation products generation rate, their nature, relative proportions and concentrations. It is noticeable that the highest alpha-tocopherol concentrations induce the generation of some toxic compounds at earlier stages of the thermoxidation process and sometimes in higher concentration, such as certain oxygenated a, beta-unsaturated aldehydes and monoepoxides derived from linoleic groups.

AB Isoflavones have an affinity for estrogen receptors (ERs) including beneficial affinity for ER beta. Widely used soy is a source of poorly absorbed isoflavones glycosides. Red clover contains mostly easily absorbed free aglycones. Red clover sprouts were cultivated under different conditions (white light, UVA or UVB for 12 or 24 h a day at 18 or 25 degrees C) to maximise the content of isoflavones, especially of high affinity for ER beta. The affinity of isoflavones to ERs was evaluated by molecular modelling and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). The richest source of isoflavones, especially formononetin were sprouts cultivated for 10 days under continuous white light and at 25 degrees C (562 mg/100 g of fresh mass). Formononetin and the above sprouts has been shown to have a high affinity for ER beta. Red clover sprouts can be considered as a source of phytoestrogens with high biological activity and as a dietary supplement reducing menopausal symptoms.

AB Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is widely used in the polymer-salt systems. However, the low polarity of the PEG-rich phase limits the application of aqueous biphasic systems (ABS). To overcome this disadvantage, a small quantity of ionic liquid (IL) was used as an adjuvant in ABS to enlarge the polarity range. Therefore, an innovative study involving addition of 4 wt% imidazolium-based ILs to the PEG 600/NaH2PO4 ABS, aiming at controlling the phase behavior and extraction ability, was carried out. The phase diagrams, the tie-lines and the partitioning behavior of L-phenylalanine and ILs were studied in these systems. The results reveal that L-phenylalanine preferentially partitions for the PEG-rich phase. The addition of 4 wt% IL to ABS controls the partitioning behavior of L-phenylalanine, which depends on the type of IL employed. Moreover, it is verified that increasing temperature lead to a decrease in the partition coefficient of L-phenylalanine.

AB This work outlines HPLC coupled with DAD detection for accurate quantification of patulin (mycotoxin) in strawberries. The optimized extraction of fruit samples through the modified QuEChERS technique in acetonitrile acidified with acetic acid (1%, v/v) and citrate-buffered salts followed by dispersive solid phase extraction using a primary secondary amine and graphitized carbon is described. The method presents LOD and LOQ of 1.5 and 5 mu g/kg, respectively and has been validated in strawberry matrix at three concentration levels (5, 10 and 50 mu g/kg), according to SANTE/11945/2015 and the 2002/657/EC Decision requirements. All validated patulin levels show high percentage of patulin recovery. The validation procedure also includes the intermediate precision performed within three successive days in samples spiked with patulin. The developed method was applied for analysis of fresh and frozen strawberries purchased at local markets. Patulin level in analyzed samples was below the level of detection.

AB This paper proposes a simple, rapid and green ultrasound assisted and ionic liquid dispersive microextraction procedure using pyrocatechol violet (PV) as complexing reagent and 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)- imide [C6MIM][Tf2N] as ionic liquid for the detection of tin employing electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry (ETAAS). The optimization step was performed using a two-level full factorial design involving the following factors: pH of the working media, amount reagents, ionic liquid volume and extraction time and the chemometric response was tin recovery. The procedure allowed the determination of tin with limits of detection and quantification of 3.4 and 11.3 ng L-1, respectively. The relative standard deviation was 4.5% for a tin solution of 0.50 mu g L-1. The validation method was confirmed by analysis of rice flour certified reference material. The method was applied for the quantification of tin in several food samples. The concentration range found varied from 0.10 to 1.50 mu g g(-1).

AB The purpose of this study was to investigate bacterial communities and health-benefit-related parameters in doenjang prepared with various brine concentrations (8, 12, 16, and 20%). Phenolic, flavonoid, melanoidin and isoflavone contents, antioxidation, and antiproliferation of doenjang (AD8, AD12, AD16, and AD20) aged for 3 months were compared with those of initial doenjang (ID8, ID12, ID16, and ID20). The ID8 and AD8 doenjang, made with 8% brine, contained higher phenolics, melanoidins, and isoflavones than those with high salinity. As results of bacterial communities, Enterococcus was a dominant bacterium in most doenjang, while Lactobacillus was predominant in AD8. Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (32.5 mu mol TE/g dwb) and DPPH radical-scavenging capacity (57 mu mol TE/g dwb) values of AD8 were the highest among samples. The EC50 of HT-29 cell proliferation treated with AD8 was 0.47 mg/mL, while EC50 of AD20 was 1.07 mg/mL, indicating stronger antiproliferative activity in low-salinity doenjang.

AB Anthocyanins as antioxidants are potential to protect liver from alcoholic damage, but might be pro-oxidants under certain conditions. In this study, twelve purple sweet potatoes anthocyanins (PSPA) were isolated and their effects on alcohol-induced liver injury were studied. These PSPA were rich in cyanidin derivatives and fed to male C57BL/6 mice as colorants in alcoholic drink with low, median, or high dosages PSPA i.e. 50, 100, or 300 mg/kg.BW.d. Compared to the alcohol group, the median-dose PSPA showed a clear improvement in the liver indexes/histology, serum ALT level, oxidative stress status, and even a recovery to the normal level, however the high dose PSPA promoted the liver injury via a pro-oxidant effect, as reflected by increased malondialdehyde (MDA) content and decreased GSH level. The results suggested that cyanidin derivatives with an ortho-hydroxyl structure on B-ring might promote the oxidative stress of alcohol-induced liver injury at high doses as a prooxidant.

AB The mechanism of action of food-derived angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptides has not been completely elucidated. In the present study, ion-exchange chromatography, gel filtration chromatography, reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography, and liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass (LC-ESI-MS/MS) were employed for purifying and identifying the ACE inhibitory peptides from hazelnut. To understand the mode of action of these peptides, ACE inhibition kinetics, in vitro and in vivo bioavailability assays, active site analysis, and interaction between the inhibitory peptides and ACE were investigated. The results identified novel ACE inhibitory peptides Ala-Val-Lys-Val-Leu (AVKVL), Tyr-Leu-Val-Arg (YLVR), and Thr-Leu-Val-Gly-Arg (TLVGR) with IC50 values of 73.06, 15.42, and 249.3 mu M, respectively. All peptides inhibited the ACE activity via a non-competitive mode. The binding free energies of AVKVL, YLVR, and TLVGR for ACE were -3.46, -6.48, and -7.37 kcal/mol, respectively. The strong inhibition of ACE by YLVR may be attributed to the formation of cation-pi interactions.

AB The aim of this work was to evaluate the effects of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) on amylolytic enzyme activity and starch digestibility. For the first time, we investigated the interaction between alpha-amylase or glucoamylase and CNCs using ultraviolet visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectroscopy, fluorescence quenching method, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and circular dichroism (CD). The results of UV and fluorescence spectra suggested that CNCs interacted with a-amylase and glucoamylase. Increasing the concentration of CNCs caused a reduction of alpha-amylase and glucoamylase activities. The FTIR and CD results indicated that CNCs induced structural changes in the secondary structure of alpha-amylase and glucoamylase. By incorporating CNCs into maize, potato and pea starches, the contents of rapid digestible starch and slowly digestible starch of the cooked starches decreased while resistant starch content increased.

AB Carotenoid profiles of goldenberry (Physalis peruviana L.) fruits differing in ripening states and in different fruit fractions (peel, pulp, and calyx of ripe fruits) were investigated by HPLC-DAD-APCI-MSn. Out of the 53 carotenoids detected, 42 were tentatively identified. The carotenoid profile of unripe fruits is dominated by (all-E)lutein (51%), whereas in ripe fruits, (all-E)-beta-carotene (55%) and several carotenoid fatty acid esters, especially lutein esters esterified with myristic and palmitic acid as monoesters or diesters, were found. In overripe fruits, carotenoid conversion products and a higher proportion of carotenoid monoesters to diesters compared to ripe fruits were observed. Overripe fruits showed a significant decrease in total carotenoids of about 31% due to degradation. The observed conversion and degradation processes included epoxidation, isomerization, and deesterification. The peel of ripe goldenberries showed a 2.8 times higher total carotenoid content of 332.00 mu g/g dw compared to the pulp.

AB The effects of milk ingredients, whey protein concentrate (WPC), whey lactalbumin (WLAC) and skim milk powder (SMP) on oat starch characteristics in terms of pasting, rheological, freeze-thaw and swelling behaviour, were investigated. Oat starch was extracted from oat flour and different proportions of dairy ingredients were mixed with oat starch. Substitution of oat starch with milk components increased hot paste stability and reduced peak viscosity using the RVA method of assessment. Furthermore, thermal processing affected the granules size, swelling power and flow behaviour of the mixtures containing oat starch in combination with different dairy ingredients. Oat starch illustrated reduced swelling and breakdown properties when pasted in the presence of WPC and SMP. This study also showed that addition of SMP resulted in an increase in freeze-thaw syneresis and reduction in starch granule size. SMP was found to affect the oat starch properties more significantly in comparison with WPC and WLAC.

AB Three antioxidant extracts (collagen hydrolysate, pomegranate peel extract, shrimp lipid extract) were encapsulated in soy phosphatidylcholine liposomes with the addition of glycerol. The particle size of the fresh liposomes ranged from 75.7 to 81.0 nm and zeta potential from -64.6 to -88.2 mV. Freeze-drying increased particle size (199-283 nm), and slightly decreased zeta potential. The lyophilized liposomes were incorporated in squid surimi gels at 10.5% concentration. An alternative functional formulation was also prepared by adding 2% of non-encapsulated bioactive extract. The gels were characterized in terms of colour, texture and oxidative stability (TBARS) after processing and also after frozen storage. The incorporation of the freeze-dried liposomes caused a slight decrease in gel strength and contributed to maintaining the stability of the gels during long-term frozen storage. The antioxidant properties of the bioactive extracts, liposomes and in vitro digested surimi gels were determined.

AB Ferulic, caffeic, sinapic, and coumaric acids, belonging to the class of hydroxycinnamic acids (HAs), are bioactive polyphenols widespread in the plant kingdom and present in the human diet. Due to their biological properties and effects in the prevention of various diseases associated with oxidative stress, HAs can be exploited for attractive nutraceutical applications. Starting from this and in order to increase bioaccessibility, we encapsulated HAs in lipid-core nanocapsules (NCs) based on a biodegradable and biocompatible poly(epsilon-caprolactone) polymer. The results showed that nanoparticles loaded with hydroxycinnamic acids (HA-NCs) have diameter of 224-253 nm, encapsulation efficiency of 53-78%, and are stable over time (30 days). In vitro tests evidenced that NCs are able to preserve HAs in the gastric simulated fluid and release them in the intestinal simulated fluid. The delivery system developed could be employed to create novel functional foods.

AB Physicochemical and gelation properties of myofibrillar proteins from silver carp surimi as affected by chopping under different vacuum degrees (0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06 and 0.08 MPa) were investigated. With the increase of vacuum degree, size and quantity of air bubbles in surimi paste decreased, disulfide bond content of myofibrillar proteins decreased significantly (p < .05) and then slight increased (p > .05), while surface hydrophobicity of myofibrillar proteins increased gradually (p < .05). Gel mechanical properties, chemical interactions (nonspecific associations, hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interactions) and FAXL (cross-linking degree of free amino group) of heat-induced surimi gel increased significantly (p < .05) with vacuum degree. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation showed that three-dimensional network of surimi gel under higher vacuum degree was more compact and orderly. Results indicated that vacuum chopping imparted physicochemical and structural changes of fish myofibrillar protein, which might contribute to the improvement in gelling properties of myofibrillar proteins.

AB The epithionitriles, 1-cyano-2,3-epithiopropane, in particular, and 1-cyano-3,4-epithiobutane, are important, but yet underestimated glucosinolate hydrolysis products that are released instead of the cancer preventative isothiocyanates in Brassica vegetables, such as cabbage, broccoli, or pak choi. Here, we characterized the reactivity of 1-cyano-2,3-epithiopropane under aqueous heat treatment conditions and compared our findings to those of the related epithionitriles 1-cyano-3,4-epithiobutane and 1-cyano-4,5-epithiopentane. In contrast to the other epithionitriles, 1-cyano-2,3-epithiopropane is highly reactive. As a result, 2-aminothiophene and dimeric 1,4-dithiane-2,5-diacetonitrile were identified as main products and a reaction mechanism is proposed. Formation of 2-aminothiophene was also observed in cooked white cabbage samples. Moreover, three novel compounds were identified as derivatives of the related epithionitriles. The results imply that apart from isothiocyanates, process-derived compounds should be considered in regards to cancer preventative Brassica vegetable related bioactivity.

AB A novel aspartic protease gene (RmproA) was cloned from the thermophilic fungus Rhizomucor miehei CAU432 and expressed in Pichia pastoris. The RmproA was successfully expressed in P. pastoris as an active extracellular protease. High protease activity of 3480.4 U/mL was obtained by high cell-density fermentation. The protease was purified by the two step protocols to homogeneity. The molecular mass of the RmproA was estimated to be 52.4 kDa by SDS-PAGE and 50.6 kDa by gel filtration. The purified enzyme was optimally active at pH 5.5 and 55 degrees C, respectively. The enzyme exhibited a broad range of substrate specificity. RmproA-treated pork muscle showed lower shear force than papain-treated sample at a relative low concentration, suggesting its effectiveness on meat tenderization. Moreover, turtle hydrolysis by RmproA resulted in a large amount of small peptides, which exhibited high ACE-inhibitory activity. Thus, RmproA may be a potential candidate for several industrial applications.

All parameters in the extraction step, including selection and loading of both extracting and dispersing solvents, amount of both extractant and disperser solvent were investigated and optimized. PhAA/TMG DES achieved higher recovery and enrichment factor compared to other DESs. The validated method showed good linearity with correlation coefficients, r(2) > 0.9990 for all the analytes. Furthermore, this is the first time that eco-friendly solvents are used for the extraction of oxyprenylated phenylpropanoids and the corresponding extract analyzed with ultra high performance liquid chromatography with photodiode array detection.

AB Thermal processing can modify the structure and function of food proteins and may alter their allergenicity. This work aimed to elucidate the influence of moist thermal treatments on the IgE-reactivity of cashew and pistachio. IgE-western blot and IgE-ELISA were complemented by Skin Prick Testing (SPT) and mediator release assay to determine the IgE cross-linking capability of treated and untreated samples. Moist thermal processing diminished the IgE-binding properties of both nuts, especially after heat/pressure treatment. The wheal size in SPT was importantly reduced after application of thermally-treated samples. For cashew, heat/pressure treated-samples still retain some capacity to cross-link IgE and degranulate basophils, however, this capacity was diminished when compared with untreated cashew. For pistachio, the degranulation of basophils after challenge with the harshest heat/pressure treatment was highly decreased. Boiling produced more variable results, however this treatment applied to both nuts for 60 min, led to an important decrease of basophil degranulation.

AB Key modifying roles of microbial transglutaminase (MTGase) in the development of innovative probiotic and non-probiotic yogurts with improved functional and quality characteristics have been comprehensively reviewed. MTGase crosslinking reactions with milk proteins stabilize the three-dimensional structure of yogurt. Yogurts treated with MTGase showed decreased syneresis, increased water-holding capacity and viscosity, homogeneous structure, desired texture, and physicochemical high stability during storage time. The utilization of MTGase does not affect negatively the sensory attributes of yogurt. Inclusion of MTGase into acidified yogurt drinks reduces the serum separation with an improved viscoelasticity. This multi-functional enzyme also protects the viable starter and probiotic cells in yogurts. Further studies are required to assess the viability of probiotics in yogurts protected using MTGase-mediated microcapsules.

AB A bioaccessibility study of polyphenols after in vitro simulated large intestine fermentation was carried out on edible nuts. Raw nuts were also analysed for total phenolic content and antioxidant potential, considering both bound and free phenolics. The highest phenolic content was found in walnuts, followed by pistachios extracts (596.9 and 410.1 mg gallic acid equivalents 100 g(-1), respectively). Consistently, the total antioxidant capacity was highest in walnuts (3689.7 mu M trolox equivalents 100 g(-1)) followed by peanuts and pistachios (3169.6 and 2990.1 mu M trolox equivalents 100 g(-1), respectively). Data showed high correlations between total phenolics and both antioxidant activities. The metabolomics-based phenolic profile depicted during in vitro fermentation showed a degradation of higher-molecular-weight phenolics over 48 hours of faecal fermentation, with a concurrent increase in low-molecular-weight compounds (hydroxybenzoic and hydroxycinnamic acids, alkylphenols, and tyrosols). Our findings indicate that nuts deliver polyphenols into the colon, with bioaccessibility values not negligible for alkylphenols, tyrosols and phenolic acids.

AB Enzymatic hydrolysis of fish proteins has been employed as a principle method for converting under-utilised fish into valuable products for the pharmaceutical and health food industries. In this study, six commercial enzymes were tested for their ability to make fish protein hydrolysate powders from whole blue whiting. The chemical and functional properties of these powders were compared. The powders all had high solubility (> 80%) across a wide pH range in water and their solubility improved further within a vitamin-tea beverage matrix (> 85%). Varying degrees of anti-oxidant activities were recorded for the powders using three model systems (DPPH, ferrous chelating and reducing power). This study demonstrates that commercial enzymes are useful for the extraction and alteration of fish protein from a low value source to produce highly digestible, low molecular weight peptide powders that could be used as a fortifying health ingredient, especially in beverages.

AB Phenolics present in the free, esterified, glycosylated and insoluble-bound forms of araticum pulp, peel and seed were for the first time characterized and quantified using HPLC-ESI-MS/MS. Levels of total phenolics, flavonoids, condensed tannins and antioxidant activities from araticum fruit followed the order peel > pulp > seed. Overall, insoluble-bound and esterified phenolics were the dominant forms of phenolics from araticum fruit parts and the highest contributors to their antioxidant activities. Extracts were found to contain contrasting levels of phenolics that were specific to each fruit part. From 10 phenolics quantified in araticum fruit, catechin and epicatechin were the major ones from pulp and peel, whereas seed displayed caffeic acid, catechin and epicatechin as its main phenolics. Araticum fruit was found to provide a good source of phenolics, and the full exploitation of this fruit may find applications in the food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries.

AB Nisin is applied broadly in the food industry as an antimicrobial peptide. The objective of this study is to prepare nisin nanoparticles using free nisin by a facile nanoprecipitation technique and to investigate their antimicrobial activity after high-temperature processing. Transmission electron microscopic images showed that the size of extra-small nisin nanoparticles with different initial concentrations of nisin (0.1%, 0.3% and 0.5%) was 5, 10 and 15 nm, respectively. The nisin nanoparticles were stable at pH 5.0 with the smallest size. Moreover, nisin nanoparticles exhibited a higher antimicrobial activity than free nisin at a concentration below 2.0 mg/ml after autoclave treatment. These results suggested that nisin nanoparticles could serve as a potential food preservative.

AB The aim of this study was to identify specific chemical bonds and characteristic structures in melanoidins formed from D-glucose and L-alanine between 130 and 200 degrees C. The results might be used to control the type and amount of melanoidin produced during food processing. For this purpose, complementary techniques, such as FTIR, NMR, EPR, and MALDI-ToF, were employed. At 160 degrees C color, solubility and UV/Vis absorption change characteristically and consequently, structural transformations could be observed in FTIR and NMR spectra. For example, sharp signals of N-H, C-N, and C-H oscillations in the L-alanine spectrum are prone to inhomogeneous broadening in melanoidins prepared above 150 degrees C. These changes are caused due to formation of heterogeneous macromolecular structures and occur during condensation reactions that lead to an increasing loss of water from the melanoidins with increasing temperatures. Additionally, MALDI-ToF-MS indicates the polymerization of glyoxal/glyoxylic acid and EPR shows the formation of radical structures.

Alba, Y3) were investigated by gas chromatography-olfactometry (GC-O), odor activity value (OAV), gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and flame photometric detection (FPD). The results showed that 41, 37 and 41 compounds were detected in Y1, Y2 and Y3 samples, respectively. In addition, 12, 11, and 12 sulfur compounds were identified in three samples by FPD, respectively. Quantitative analysis showed 2-(methylthio) ethanol, methionol, dimethyl sulfide, methional and 3-ethylthiophene were present in relatively high amounts in each of the three samples. Furthermore, benzaldehyde, ethyl butanoate, (E)-2-nonenal, 1-hexanol, hexanal, methional, 3-mercaptohexyl acetate and 3-mercaptohexanol were present with much higher OAVs than other compounds. Finally, four compounds (pentanal, ethyl acetate, acetic acid, methionol) were selected to investigate possible effects on six descriptors, which indicated that the volatile compounds at sub-threshold concentrations are likely to contribute to overall aroma.

AB This study aimed at evaluating the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) contamination of commercial vegetable oils and examined the identity through the fatty acids profiles. Coconut, safflower, evening primrose, and linseed oils marketed in Sao Paulo (Brazil) were investigated totaling 69 samples. Four PAHs, benzo[a] anthracene (BaA), chrysene (Chr), benzo[b] fluoranthene (BbF), and benzo[a] pyrene (BaP), were detected in 96% of the samples at individual levels ranging from not detected to 14.99 mu g kg(-1). Chrysene was the abundant hydrocarbon found among all types of oils, with the highest median values. The results of the fatty acid profiles revealed that 43% showed different profiles according to the ones on their labels, with a higher incidence of adulteration of evening primrose oils. The maximum tolerable limits by European Regulation No. 835/2011 were exceeded for BaP in 12%, and for total 4 PAHs in 28%, with a greater contribution of adulterated samples.

AB Complete characterizations of free and bonded phenolic compounds, presented in four cultivars of barley from two regions of Czech Republic, were achieved, using optimized solvent extraction and liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. The optimization of extraction of free polyphenols was performed using Box-Behnken design and response surface methodology. The intra-day and extra-day precision of developed method were below 6% and 12%, respectively. The isolation of polyphenols bonded to the cell wall structure was carried out by a hydrolysis process. In all cultivars, p-hydroxybenzoic, p-coumaric and ferulic acids were the most abundant compounds. Their average amounts in barley samples were 17.6, 15.2 and 54.4% (m/m), respectively. The highest amount of these compounds was found in the bonded form, proving the importance of this procedure for the correct characterization of total polyphenols in food matrices.

AB The industry discards generous organic wastewater in sweet potato starch factory and scrap tea in tea production. A simplified procedure to recover all biochemicals from the wastewater of sweet potato starch factory and use them to make health black tea and theaflavins from scrap green tea was developed. The sweet potato wastewater was sequentially treated by isoelectric precipitation, ultrafiltration and nanofiltration to recover polyphenol oxidase (PPO), beta-amylase, and small molecular fractions, respectively. The PPO fraction can effectively transform green tea extracts into black tea with high content of theaflavins through the optimized fed-batch feeding fermentation. The PPO transformed black tea with sporamins can be used to make health black tea, or make theaflavins by fractionation with ethyl acetate. This work provides a resource- and environment-friendly approach for economically utilizing the sweet potato wastewater and the scrap tea, and making biochemical, nutrient and health products.

AB Germination along with ultrasonic assisted extraction induced a significant beneficial effect on the characteristics of polyphenolic components profile, GABA contents and in vitro antioxidant capacity of the foxtail millet flour extracts. The total antioxidant activity (29.0-45.23 mgAAE/g) and reducing power (0.53-0.76 mu g/ml) increase during germination were due to quantitative increase in phthalicacid; hex-3yl-ester; hexadecanoicacid methylester etc. whereas, increase in DPPH (48.32-59.62%) and hydrogen peroxide scavenging activities (35.44-63.07 mM-Trolox/g) were attributed to increase in hexadecanoic acid methylester; 9,12-Octadecadienoicacid ethylester and synthesis of new compounds like pentadecanoicacid; 14-methyl-methylester etc. The metal chelating abilities (34.92-57.38 mgEDTA/g) and in vitro antioxidant activity increase due to overall increase in phenolics, flavonoids along with GABA contents. Synthesis of additional polyphenolic components viz. astaxanthin, propanoicacid, 1-monolinoleoylglycerol trimethylsilylether, 9,12,15-octadecatrienoicacid etc. as a result of germinated explored the possible potential utilization of germinated foxtail millet grains in various functional and convenience food formulations.

AB The present study was aimed to evaluate the interaction between anthocyanins from black rice and soybean protein isolate (SPI) via non-covalent and covalent bindings and the impact of these interactions on the functional and conformational changes of soybean protein. The conformational changes of the protein structure with different concentrations of anthocyanins (0.05, 0.1%, and 0.2%) were analyzed using three-dimensional fluorescence and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The anthocyanins were more likely to form covalent interactions with SPI instead of non-covalent interactions. The addition of anthocyanins changed the secondary structure of SPI with a decrease in beta-sheets and an increase in beta-turns and random coils. The emulsifying and foaming properties of SPI were improved after complexation with anthocyanins. This study might be useful for elucidating the mechanisms behind the binding of anthocyanins with SPI and the possible uses of SPI-anthocyanin complexes in food formulations.

This study was carried out to evaluate: 1) the variability of fruit characteristics of different accessions; 2) the effects of centrifugation and microwave treatment on extracting oil from the fruit and on its qualitative characteristics; 3) the nutraceutical characteristics of the fruit and seeds of different accessions. The results showed a large variability in fruit size and oil/dry matter contents among the different accessions. There was a significant relationship between the dry matter and oil contents in the pulp. The combined use of centrifugation and microwave treatments gave high oil extraction yields (67-68%). The oils had good fatty acid composition and antioxidant capacity. The results gave an initial picture about the total phenol contents and antioxidant capacities in the seeds and in the different parts of the fruit.

AB The content of glucose, fructose, sucrose, maltose and water were determined for multiflorous honey of Great Poland. The measurements were carried out for different fractions of honey and also for the liquefied honey at 40 degrees C. Water activity and pH were both determined for all samples. A new method of recognizing liquefied honey is proposed based on the water influence on pH and the monosaccharides and disaccharides contents. The simple function of quadratic polynomial enabled to reveal the different character of the liquefied honey. The electrical conductivity behavior of different dry matter samples of honey are presented in the wide range of temperature. The proton spin-lattice relaxation measurements were recorded for the crystalline fraction in the magnetic field range covering the proton Larmor frequencies from 0.01 to 25 MHz and in the wide range of temperature. Heating the honey at 30 degrees C results in the irreversible molecular structure changes.

AB Morus alba L. (family Moreaceae), also known as white mulberry, is distinguished as a source of highly promising traditional medicines (including Mori Folium, Mori Fructus, Mori Ramulus and Mori Cortex) and also functional foods. Over the past two decades, the vast majority of the studies with regard to the isolation and bioactivities of M. alba polysaccharides have mainly focused on its leaves and fruits, which are both medicinal and edible. The tender M. alba leaf is edible and can be used to make tea, the mature M. alba fruit is sweet and juicy. M. alba fruits and leaves contain rich bioactive polysaccharides, which are shown to possess various promising bioactivities, mainly including antidiabetic, immunomodulation, anti-inflammation, antioxidation, anti-obesity, hepatoprotection and renoprotection. The main purpose of this review is to provide systematically reorganized information on structural characteristics and bioactivities of M. alba polysaccharides to support their further therapeutic potentials and sanitarian functions.

   ANTIVIRAL ACTIVITY
AB Due to antitumor and antioxidant activities, there has been increasing interest in fucoidans, sulfated polysaccharides, from brown algae. Currently, the classic hot water extraction and acid extraction are time-consuming, and can cause the partial cleavage of sulfate esters, leading to bioactivity loss. The present study developed a novel process for extracting fucoidans from Laminaria japonica with 0.5% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid at 70 degrees C. Crude fucoidans (CFs) obtained with a yield (similar to 16%) was purified to different fractions of F1, F2 and F3. The fractions displayed similar anticancer activity against Hela cells. Due to the differences in sulfate content, molar ratio of sulfate to fucose and monosaccharide composition, F1 and F2 exhibited stronger antioxidant ability than CFs and F3. This novel extraction provides an efficient procedure for extracting fucoidans from brown seaweeds with high extraction yield and removing pigments with one single step.

AB The aims of this study were to synthesize chlorophyll derivatives, pheophytins and Zn-pheophytins, from chlorophylls extracted from spinach, characterize them, and evaluate their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. The chlorophylls isolated from spinach were identified by means of FT-IR and NMR spectroscopies. The synthesis of pheophytins and Zn-pheophytins was confirmed by UV-Vis spectral analyses. The antioxidant activity of chlorophylls, pheophytins, and Zn-pheophytins was studied. The results revealed that the Zn-pheophytins showed the highest 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging and beta-carotene bleaching activities, followed by chlorophylls and pheophytins. Additionally, Zn-pheophytins showed substantial inhibitory activity against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced NO production in RAW 264.7 cells. Furthermore, Zn-pheophytins remarkably suppressed LPS-induced expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in RAW 264.7 cells and showed no cytotoxicity. Our findings indicated that Zn-pheophytins have strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and can therefore be a potential source of bioactive compounds for nutraceutical, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical applications.

AB The stability of two Alternaria mycotoxins, alternariol (AOH) and alternariol monomethyl ether (AME), has been investigated during the food processing of tomato products simulating commercial processing conditions. The production stages assessed were the storage of raw fruits, fruit washing, and thermal processing. It was observed that time of storage significantly reduced the initial concentration of AOH, but only if tomatoes were stored at 35 degrees C. For AME, 12 h were sufficient to reduce the initial concentration, regardless of the temperature at which samples were stored (25, 30 and 35 degrees C). The washing step achieved the highest reduction of AOH and AME. This reduction was even more efficient when using sodium hypochlorite solutions. Finally, during the heat treatment (80-110 degrees C), results showed that heating tomato samples at 100 and 110 degrees C, significantly affected AOH stability, though AME seemed to not be affected by these thermal processes.

AB This study was conducted to evaluate color and anthocyanin stability of clarified acerola juice (CAJ) as affected by montmorillonite (Mnt) at different concentrations (0-6 wt%, dry basis). While non-complexed CAJ suffered noticeable color degradation with time and pH variations, the presence of Mnt (especially at 4-6 wt%) not only changed the initial color of CAJ but also made it more stable with time and pH changes. CAJ/Mnt mixtures were ultracentrifuged in order to separate them into supernatants and anthocyanin-complexed Mnt precipitates. The supernatants presented decreasing anthocyanin contents with increasing Mnt concentrations, indicating pigment retention by the precipitates. X-ray diffraction of precipitates showed that Mnt interlayer spacing was increased by increasing anthocyanin/Mnt ratios, corroborating anthocyanin intercalation. FTIR revealed a band at 1530 cm(-1) ascribed to formation of anthocyanin-Mnt complexes. Moreover, chromatograms indicated the selective adsorption of two compounds by Mnt, which were identified by LC-MS as cyanidin-3-O-rhamnoside and pelargonidin-3-O-rhamnoside.

AB The effects of high intensity ultrasound (HIU) modification (power: 100-800 W, 15 min) on the conformation stability, in vitro digestibility and allergenicity of tropomyosin (TM) from Exopalaemon modestus were investigated. HIU treatment oxidized the Cys, Met and Lys in TM and degraded TM to generate protein fragments by HIU-induced free radicals. The alpha-helix content decreased, while ss-sheet, ss-turn and random coil increased. The immunoblotting and ELISA data suggested HIU treatment reduced the allergenicity and contributed to higher digestibility of TM. TM had resistance to gastric digestion, while intestinal digestion totally hydrolyzed TM, and the sequential HIU-gastric-intestinal digestion most efficiently hydrolyzed TM and reduced the allergenicity of digestion products. Stronger HIU could loosen TM structure, strengthen the gastrointestinal digestibility of TM and reduce the allergenicity of TM and digestion products to low level.

AB Non-enzymatic browning during storage of fruit juice causes the development of brown color and off-flavors that ultimately lead to a decrease in consumer acceptability. This study investigates the role of Reactive Carbonyl Species (RCS) from the Maillard reaction on browning formation in apple juice during storage. Over a 10-week period under accelerated conditions (35 degrees C), a significant increase in brown color development was observed and positively correlated to the RCS concentrations. Supplementation experiments established causality between specific RCS and browning and allowed for the identification of glyoxal and methylglyoxal as key browning intermediates in apple juice. Finally, phloretin, a ubiquitous apple dihydrochalcone, was reported as an efficient browning suppressor by significantly reducing the RCS levels and inhibiting the color formation during storage.

New primers were designed to target the 16S rRNA gene, as a universal maker for fish detection, with fully demonstrated specificity for a wide range of fish species. Both systems showed similar absolute sensitivities, down to 0.01 pg of fish DNA, and adequate real-time PCR performance parameters. The probe system showed higher relative sensitivity and dynamic range (0.0001-50%) than the EvaGreen (0.05-50%). They were both precise, but trueness was compromised at the highest tested level with the EvaGreen assay. Therefore, both systems were successful, although the probe one exhibited the best performance. Its application to verify labelling compliance of foodstuffs suggested a high level of mislabelling and/or fraudulent practices.

AB The glycoside hydrolase, alpha-L-rhamnosidase, could remove the bitter taste of naringin from citrus juices. However, most alpha-L-rhamnosidases are easily deactivated at high temperatures, limiting the practice in debittering citrus juices. The V529A mutant of the alpha-L-rhamnosidase r-Rha1 from Aspergillus niger JMU-TS528 was developed with improved thermostability using directed evolution technology and site-directed mutagenesis. The enzyme mutant had a half-live of thermal inactivation T-(1/2) of 1.92 h, 25.00 min, and 2 min at 60, 65, and 70 degrees C, respectively. In addition, it had improved substrate affinity and better resistance to the inhibition of glucose. The improved substrate affinity was related to its lowered binding energy. Most significantly, the naringin content was reduced to below the bitter taste threshold by treatment with 75 U/mL of the mutant during the preheating process of orange juice production. The comprehensive results indicate that thermostability improvement could promote the practical value of alpha-L-rhamnosidase in citrus juice processing.

AB Developing new distillation strategies can help the spirits industry to improve quality, safety and process efficiency. Batch stills equipped with a packed column and an internal partial condenser are an innovative experimental system, allowing a fast and flexible management of the rectification. In this study, the impact of four factors (heart-cut volume, head-cut volume, pH and cooling flow rate of the internal partial condenser during the head-cut fraction) on 18 major volatile compounds of Muscat spirits was optimized using response surface methodology and desirability function approaches. Results have shown that high rectification at the beginning of the heart-cut enhances the overall positive aroma compounds of the product, reducing off-flavor compounds. In contrast, optimum levels of heart-cut volume, head-cut volume and pH factors varied depending on the process goal. Finally, three optimal operational conditions (head off-flavors reduction, flowery terpenic enhancement and fruity ester enhancement) were evaluated by chemical and sensory analysis.

AB This study analyzed the effect of low sulfur dioxide concentrations on the chromatic properties, phytochemical composition and antioxidant activity of Aglianico red wines with respect to wines produced from conventional winemaking. We determined the phytochemical composition by spectrophotometric methods and HPLC-DAD analysis and the in vitro antioxidant activity of different wine samples by the ORAC assay. The main important classes of fluorophore molecules in red wine were identified by Front-Face fluorescence spectroscopy, and the emission intensity trend was investigated at various sulfur dioxide concentrations. Lastly, we tested the effects of both conventional and low sulfite wines on ex vivo human erythrocytes under oxidative stimulus by the cellular antioxidant activity (CAA) assay and the hemolysis test. The addition of sulfur dioxide, which has well-known side effects, increased the content of certain bioactive components but did not raise the erythrocyte antioxidant capacity.

AB In this study, an efficient accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) technology was applied for rapid extraction of polysaccharides from the processing by-products of Chimonobambusa quadrangularis (CPS). The extraction yields, physicochemical characterization, and antioxidant activities of CPS obtained by ASE and hot water extraction (HWE) were further compared. A maximal ASE-CPS yield was obtained by optimized extraction conditions (temperature 126 degrees C, 2 cycles, and 22 min) using response surface methodology. The yield of polysaccharides from ASE (9.96% +/- 0.39%) was significantly higher than that from HWE (7.16% +/- 0.32%). Differences were found between ASE and HWE with the chemical composition, molecular weight distribution, rheological property, and antioxidant activities of the obtained polysaccharides, while the primary structure remained the same. ASE-CPS exhibited better chemical antioxidant activities in oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), reducing power, and DPPH and hydroxyl radical scavenging ability, whereas HWE-CPS displayed higher activity in metal chelating activity assay.

AB A neutral polysaccharide (PZMP1) with a molecular weight of 16.97 kDa was isolated from Ziziphus Jujuba cv. Muzao with water extraction, ethanol precipitation, and purification with DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow and Sephacryl S-300 column chromatography. PZMP1 was structurally characterized with high-performance gel-permeation chromatography, gas chromatography, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, methylation analysis, NMR spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy. The results show that PZMP1 is a homogeneous heteropolysaccharide composed of arabinose, galactose, glucose, mannose, and xylose in a molar percentage of 17.36: 3.29: 2.68: 1.05: 1.00. The majorly backbone of PZMP1 is composed of 1,3,5-linked Araf, 1,3-linked Araf, 1,5-linked Araf, 1,4-linked Glcp, and 1-linked Araf, 1-linked Glcp. According to an NMR analysis, the repeating unit of PZMP1 is a linear backbone with branches at positions O-3, and O-5. PZMP1 also displays effective dose-dependent hypolipidemic activity, suggesting that it is a natural hypolipidemic agent, which could contribute to the functional food qualities of jujube fruit.

AB This review summarizes research on the discovery, biosynthesis, accumulation, transport, and metabolism of 3-alkyl-2-methoxypyrazines (MPs) in grape. The MPs are a family of potent volatile compounds distributed throughout biological kingdoms. These compounds impart herbaceous/green/vegetal sensory attributes to certain varieties of wine. Generally, high levels of MPs in wine are derived mainly from the corresponding grapes. Although two pathways for MPs biosynthesis have been proposed, only the final step and the enzymes that catalyze it has been confirmed in grape, and the metabolic intermediates and key enzymes involved in other steps are still unknown. The limited understanding of MPs metabolism has restricted research on these compounds, and some empirical results cannot be explained by the current knowledge of MPs metabolism. This review provides insights into research on MPs biosynthesis and metabolism, and proposes directions for further research on this important class of flavour/odour compounds.

AB Lycopene is a bioactive component mainly found in tomato. It is characterized by a high antioxidant potential, the highest among carotenoids. Mainly due to this property, lycopene has been suggested to display many beneficial effects, including its potential cardioprotective role. Despite some contradictory observations, which appear to be mainly caused by discrepancies in the different experimental protocols applied in the different studies, growing evidence points to clear benefits of lycopene in the maintenance of cardiovascular function and health. The knowledge about lycopene's preventive effects in atherosclerosis, and other cardiovascular diseases, must be translated into changes in food patterns, aiming to increase the consumption of tomato, tomato-containing products, or other foods with high lycopene content, which can have an important impact on cardiovascular disease, particularly in countries where this represents a major public health concern.

AB Proanthocyanidins (PA) crosslink wheat gluten, increasing its polymer size and strength. However, mechanisms behind these interactions are unknown. This study used PA of different MW profiles (mean degree of polymerization 8.3 and 19.5) to investigate how PA polymerize gluten. The higher MW PA had greater binding affinity for both glutenins and gliadins than lower MW PA, whereas both PA precipitated glutenins more efficiently than gliadins. The PA preferentially bound the largest of the protein fractions available: high MW glutenin subunits (HMW-GS) over low MW-GS, and omega-gliadins over alpha- and gamma-gliadins. Furthermore, within the HMW-GS, PA bound more of the larger x-type than the smaller y-type. Proanthocyanidins reduced gluten solubility in urea and decreased surface hydrophobicity of glutenins, but not gliadins. The PA appear to preferentially crosslink HMW-GS via hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding, whereas their interaction with gliadins is dominated by hydrogen bonding and is relatively weaker.

AB The Commission Regulation (EC) Regulation N. 488/2014, established the concentration limits for cadmium in specific products based on cocoa and chocolate products as from January 2019. Based on this information there is a need to determine ultratrace levels of elements that might be presents in cocoa and chocolate products. In this work, the concentrations of Arsenic, Antimony, Cadmium, Chromium, Lead, Selenium and Vanadium were evaluated in cocoa powder and chocolate by the validation of an ICP-MS method. Good selectivity/specificity, recovery, repeatability and within-laboratory reproducibility, LOD, LOQ, range of linearity, standard measurement uncertainty parameters for method validation were achieved, in accordance with Commission Regulation. The cocoa powder revealed the maximum metal concentrations of 0.303 +/- 0.035 mg/kg for cadmium, 1.228 +/- 0.146 mg/kg for lead and 0.094 +/- 0.013 mg/kg for arsenic. A significant difference was found between cocoa powder and chocolate samples (p < .05).

AB This work describes purification of a protease from the visceral mass of the mussel Mytella charruana as well as evaluation of its ability to hydrolyze milk casein to generate antimicrobial peptides. The enzyme showed pI of 4.1 and a single polypeptide band of 83.1 kDa after SDS-PAGE. Sequence similarities with tropomyosin and myosin from mollusks were detected. The protease showed a trypsin-like activity with optimal temperature of 40 degrees C and stability in a wide pH range (3.0-9.0). K-m was 4.28 +/- 0.34 mM of the synthetic substrate N-benzoyl-DL-arginyl-rho-nitroanilide, whereas V-max was 0.056 +/- 0.001 nmol min(-1). The enzyme hydrolyzed casein, and the hydrolysate inhibited the growth of Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae at a minimal inhibitory concentration of 5.0 mu g mL(-1). In conclusion, the visceral mass of M. charruana contains a trypsin-like protease that can generate peptides from casein that have a bacteriostatic effect.

AB It is important to detect pesticides residues due to the concern over food safety. In this work, the burning ash of waste paper was used as carbon source to synthesize carbon dots (C-dots). The fluorescence of obtained C-dots could been turn off by Fe3+ which was from Fe2+ oxidized by H2O2, organophosphorus pesticides could effectively inhibit the production of H2O2 by destroying the acetylcholinesterase activity, so the fluorescence of C-dots hold turning on in the presence of organophosphorus pesticides. Based on above principle that the fluorescence intensity of C-dots was proportional to the pesticides concentration, take chlorpyrifos for example, a universal method for pesticides detection was established. The linear range was 0.01-1.0 mu g/mL with detection limit of 3 ng/mL. The method was reliable and sensitive to actual samples. The imaging of chlorpyrifos on cabbages leaves indicated this method could be used for visualization detection of organophosphorus pesticides in vegetables.

AB The digestibility of starch in foods, which is influenced by the ingredients, formulation and preparation conditions, is a major determinant of glycaemic response. The terms rapidly digestible starch (RDS) and slowly digestible starch (SDS) along with the associated analytical methodology were developed by Englyst to characterise this nutritionally relevant food attribute. The measurement uncertainty of this starch digestibility method is evaluated here with an inter-laboratory trial. Six laboratories took part in the study testing ten cereal products with mean (range) contents of RDS: 48.4 g/100 g, (23.4-76.9) and, SDS: 10.9 g/100 g, (0.8-24.2). Based on the repeatability and reproducibility measurements, the calculated uncertainty was 3.6 g/100 g for RDS and 1.9 g/100 g for SDS. This trial has demonstrated acceptable measurement uncertainty and confirmed the transferability of the method between laboratories. The SDS content can identify foods rich in slow release carbohydrates with their associated health benefits.

AB The determination of antimicrobials in aquaculture fish is important to ensure food safety. Therefore, simple and fast multiresidue methods are needed. A liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method was developed and validated for the quantification of 14 antimicrobials (quinolones and tetracyclines) in fish. Antimicrobials were extracted with trichloroacetic acid and chromatographic separation was achieved with a C18 column and gradient elution (water and acetonitrile). The method was validated (Decision 2002/657/EC) and it was fit for the purpose. Linearities were established in the matrix and the coefficients of determination were >= 0.98. The method was applied to Nile tilapia and rainbow trout (n = 29) and 14% of them contained enrofloxacin at levels above the limit of quantification (12.53-19.01 mu g.kg(-1)) but below the maximum residue limit (100 mu g.kg(-1)). Even though prohibited in Brazil and other countries, this antimicrobial reached fish. Measures are needed to ascertain the source of this compound to warrant human safety.

AB Cabernet Gernischt (CG) is a famous Chinese wine grape cultivar, the red wine of which is known for its green trait, especially when produced from grapes cultivated in regions with monsoon climate. To modify CG wine aroma, three enzyme preparations (H. uvarum extracellular enzyme, AR2000, and pectinase) were introduced in different winemaking stages with Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Free and bound aroma compounds in young wines were detected using headspace solid-phase micro-extraction and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and aroma characteristics were quantified by trained panelists. Results showed that simultaneous inoculation of enzymes and yeasts improved wine aroma. Partial least-squares regression revealed that the green trait was due mainly to varietal compounds, especially C-6 compounds, and could be partly weakened by fermentative compounds. Moreover, H. uvarum enzyme treatments enriched the acid fruit note of CG wine by enhancing the synergistic effect of varietal volatiles and certain fermentative compounds, such as esters and phenylethyls.

AB A tetrapodal receptor was synthesized and was processed into fluorescent organic nanoparticles (FONs) for determination of important analytes in aqueous medium. The receptor was fully characterized using characterization techniques. Recognition behavior of FONs towards different metal ions was investigated with fluorescence spectroscopy, amongst them Fe3+ ions showed quenching behavior in the emission spectra. The Fe3+ ion complex of FONs based sensor was further tested with different biogenic amines and ratiometric response was obtained for tyramine. Fluorescence emission profile of FONs. Fe3+ ion complex showed no change in the pH in wide range; thereby increasing their utility in biological and environmental samples. Tyramine detection was linearly proportional in response with the detection limit of 377 nM.

AB Osteosarcoma (OS) is a common primary malignancy in children and adolescents with relative high survival rate after chemotherapy. While, the toxicity of chemotherapy and personalized different response to chemotherapy makes it difficult for the selection of therapeutics and improvement of diagnosis. In this study, we conducted a combined analysis of two types of microarray datasets (gene expression and DNA methylation) from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Differential methylation sites (DMS) were identified by the IMA package and differential expression genes (DEGs) were screened out via the limma package. A total of 11,242 DMS (corresponding to 3080 genes (DMGs)) and 337 DEGs, with 40 overlaps (OS genes) between DEGs and DMGs, were identified. Enriched functions of OS genes were obtained through the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID). The OS genes were mainly enriched in the biological processes related to inflammatory/immune response and Pertussis pathways and Hematopoietic cell lineage pathways. Besides, OS specific disease network was obtained, and found that UBS and NRF1 were regulated by multiple OS genes. Kaplan Meier analysis of OS genes identified BHMT2, DOCK2, DNALI1 and RIPK3 as significant OS survival related genes. SEMA3A and PRAME are included in the 40 OS genes and within the top 10 most up-regulated DEGs. Their expression changes were further validated in U2OS osteosarcoma cell lines and hOB normal cell lines through quantitative PCR (qPCR) and consistent result with microarray analysis was obtained. Based on this study, some novel targets were identified for OS, which would be helpful in its early diagnosis and treatment.

AB Lysine specific demethylase 513 gene (KDM5B, also known as JARIDIB or PLU-1), encoding an enzyme of the lysine-specific histone demethylase family, has been reported to regulate androgen receptor transcriptional activity and male reproduction. To fully study the expression characteristics and genetic effects of pig KDM5B gene, the objective of this study was to investigate the mRNA expression profiles of KDM5B among different tissues and testicular cells (spermatogonia stem cells, SSCs; sertoli cells, SCs; leydig cells, LCs), as well as to explore the insertion/deletion (indel) variations of this gene. Expression analysis results revealed that the KDM5B gene was highly expressed in testis than other tissues in 7-day-old piglet (P < 0.01). In particular, this gene was highest expressed in testis of adult boar (P < 0.01). Furthermore, the KDM5B mRNA expression level in SSCs was significantly higher than those in LCs and SCs (P < 0.01). Besides, a 35-bp indel was first verified in the intron 11 of pig KDM5B gene, and the animals with insertion/insertion genotype exhibited superior testicular weight and testicular short perimeter than those with other genotypes (P < 0.05) in 40-day-old Landrace pigs. Together, these findings suggest that KDM5B plays a crucial role in male fertility and the 35-bp indel can be used for marker-assisted selection of boar.

AB Growing evidence shows that long non-coding RNAs (IncRNAs) have been wildly verified to modulate multiple tumorigenesis, especially lung adenocarcinoma. In present study, we aim to investigate the role of IncRNA LINC00319 in the lung adenocarcinoma carcinogenesis. We observed that increased expression of LINC00319 in lung adenocarcinoma tissues and cells in comparison to their corresponding controls. Moreover, the aberrant overexpression of LINC00319 indicated the poor prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma patients. Silence of LINC00319 was able to repress lung adenocarcinoma cell growth in vitro. Rescue assay was performed to further confirm that LINC00319 contributed to lung adenocarcinoma progression by regulating miR-450b-5p/EZH2 signal pathway. Taken together, our study discovered the oncogenic role of LINC00319 in clinical specimens and cellular experiments, showing the potential LINC00319/miR-450b-5p/EZH2 pathway. This results and findings provide a novel insight for lung adenocarcinoma tumorigenesis.

AB The provenance of Chinese loess is fundamental for understanding its origin, transportation and climatic significance. In this paper, eight samples were collected for detrital zircon age analysis, five from different deserts, and three from the Jingbian Section in the northern Chinese Loess Plateau, covering an age range of 2.6-0.03 Ma. The new results, integrated with knowledge of relevant topography and wind patterns, demonstrate that the age spectra of the detrital zircons in the loess are different from those of the sands from the Tarim, Junggar and Qaidam basins, implying that these basins were not the sources of the silts of the Loess Plateau. Further analysis suggests that the three sources for the loess are: (1) elastic materials eroded from the mountains of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (especially the Gobi Altai and Hangay), (2) elastic loess-sized materials generated by erosion of the Qilian Mountains in the NE Tibetan Plateau, and (3) minor elastic debris derived from the mountains of the North China Craton. Thus, silts of the Loess Plateau have a complex origin, although inland basins, long believed to be important sources, have only a minor role at most.

AB The loess record of Central Asia provides an important archive of regional climate and environmental changes. In contrast to the widely investigated loess deposits in the Chinese Loess Plateau, Central Asian loess-paleosol sequences remain poorly understood. Here, we present an aeolian loess section in the southern Ili Basin. Based on granularity and mineralogical analyses, we reconstruct climatic changes during the last glaciation. The results indicated that most of the abrupt climatic events (such as Dansgaard-Oeschger events and Heinrich events) were imprinted in this loess section, although their amplitudes and ages showed some differences. Compared with the millennial oscillations recoded in loess and stalagmites in East Asia, the arid Central Asia responded more sensitively to the warming events than to the cooling events. The shifting trajectory of westerlies across Central Asia played an important role in dust deposition during the stadials. The North Atlantic climatic signals may have been transmitted from Central Asia to the East Asian monsoon regions via the westerlies.

AB In Europe, the most complete loess-paleosol sequences over the past million years are preserved in the Serbian part of the Danube River drainage basin. The similarity in stratigraphy and climatic cycles between the Serbian and the Chinese loess sequences suggests that the loess deposits in these two regions could play an important role in the study of intercontinental climatic correlations and linkage. However, previous magnetostratigraphic studies of the Serbian loess, mainly conducted using the alternating field (AF) demagnetization approach, show significant differences with the Chinese loess, especially the stratigraphic positioning of the Matuyama-Brunhes boundary (MBB). Here, we conduct a detailed magnetostratigraphic investigation of a composite Titel-Stari Slankamen loess section in the Vojvodina (northern Serbia), using thermal and hybrid demagnetization methods, aiming to establish new chronological constraints for the Danube Basin loess. Based on the analyses of the mineral magnetic properties, anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility, progressive thermal and hybrid demagnetization, the MBB was determined within S8, broadly consistent with the MBB position seen in the Chinese loess. Present evidence supports the hypothesis that the overall normal polarity in the upper part of L9, with a thickness of 2.1 m, was possibly caused by a combination of the remagnetization of remanence-carrying coarse grained magnetite during the Brunhes normal chron and bioturbation during the forming of the overlying paleosol S8. Thus, our magnetostratigraphic results provide solid chronological evidence for the coherence of pedostratigraphy and climatostratigraphy for the loess deposits in the Danube Basin and China. The synchronous occurrence of the strongest developed paleosol S5 (corresponding to MISs 15-13) and the least weathered thick loess unit L9 (corresponding to MISs 24-22) in the two regions confirms that extreme climatic events during these two intervals are possibly common features of the climate in the Northern Hemisphere at those times.

AB Loess is widely distributed over Asia and North America and constitutes one of the most important surficial deposits that serve as terrestrial records of the Quaternary. The oldest Pleistocene loess in China is likely similar to 2.6 Ma, thus spanning much or all of the Pleistocene. In North America, most loess is no older than the penultimate glacial period, with the exception of Alaska, where the record may go back to similar to 3.0 Ma. On both continents, loess deposits date primarily to glacial periods, and interglacial or interstadial periods are represented by paleosols. Both glacial and non-glacial sources of silts that comprise the bulk of loess deposits are found on both continents. Although loess has been considered to be representative of the average upper continental crust, there are regionally distinctive compositions of loess in both Asia and North America. Loess deposits in Asia from Yakutia, Tajikistan, and China have compositionally distinct major element compositions, due to varying abundances of silicate minerals, carbonate minerals, and clay minerals. In North America, loess in the Mississippi River valley, the Great Plains, and Alaska are also distinguishable with regard to major element composition that reflects highly diverse source sediments. Trace element geochemistry (Sc-Th-Zr and the rare earth elements) also shows regional diversity of loess bodies, in both Asia and North America. On both continents, most loess bodies show significant contributions from later-cycle, altered sedimentary rocks, as opposed to direct derivation from igneous rocks. Further, some loess bodies have detectable contributions from mafic igneous rocks as well as major contributions from average, upper-crustal, felsic rocks. Intercalated paleosols in loess sections show geochemical compositions that differ significantly from the underlying loess parent materials. Ratios of soluble-to-insoluble elements show depletions in paleosols due to chemical weathering losses of calcite, dolomite, plagioclase, mica, apatite, and smectite. In Asia and North America, the last interglacial paleosol is more weathered than equivalent modern soils, which could be due either to a climate that was warmer and more humid, a longer period of pedogenesis, or both. In Asia, early Pleistocene loess and paleosols are both more weathered than those from the middle and late Pleistocene, forming prior to a mid-Pleistocene aridification of Asia from uplift of the Tibetan Plateau. Understanding the geochemistry of loess and paleosols can tell us much about past atmospheric circulation, past temperature and moisture regimes, and even tectonic processes.

   loess and his book Loess in China have been an inspiration for my own
   work on loess in North America. The other person to whom I would like to
   dedicate the paper is the late Robert L. Muhs, my father, who has two
   geographic connections to the study. Bob Muhs spent the first 20 years
   and last 30 years of his life in Camanche, Iowa, in the loess country
   along the upper Mississippi River that he loved so much. During World
   War II, he spent 1944 and 1945 in the U.S. Army Air Forces in China,
   stationed at various times in Guilin, Zhijiang, Chengdu, and Xi'an.
   Special thanks go to Jimin Sun, who kindly provided trace element data
   for loess he studied from various parts of China, and for his
   invitation, encouragement (and patience) in bringing this paper to

AB The desert and semi-desert region of arid central Asia is one of the most important areas of middle-latitude dust emission and deposition in the Northern Hemisphere. Marine isotope stage 2 (MIS 2) was the latest and one of the most representative intervals of dust emission from the region, and it is especially important for research into processes of dust transportation and deposition. Here, we report the results of an optically stimulated luminescence study of the Hoalin section in southern Tajikistan, which was deposited during MIS 2. The fine-grained quartz single aliquot regeneration (SAR) approach was used and its reliability was verified by internal checks. In addition, grain-size analyses, calculated dust accumulation rates (DARs) and mass accumulation rates (MARs) were used to reconstruct the pattern of climate change during MIS 2. The mean DAR for southern Tajikistan during MIS 2 was 0.43 m/ka, and the corresponding average MAR was 673 g/cm(2)/a for a non-river-terrace site, which is higher than the average MARs estimated for the central and southern Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP). In contrast to previous suggestions, the high dust DARs and MARs during the LGM indicate a 'cold-dry' climatic pattern, rather than a 'cold-humid' pattern. Our results also confirm that the patterns of high dust emission and deposition during the LGM in the mid-latitude arid zone of Asia were synchronous.

AB Spatiotemporal variations in East Asian Monsoon (EAM) precipitation during the Quaternary have been intensively studied. However, spatial variations in pre-Quaternary EAM precipitation remain largely uninvestigated, preventing a clear understanding of monsoon dynamics during a warmer climatic period. Here we compare the spatial differences in heavy mineral assemblages between Quaternary loess and pre-Quaternary Red Clay on the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) to analyze spatial patterns in weathering. Prior studies have revealed that unstable hornblende is the dominant (similar to 50%) heavy mineral in Chinese loess deposited over the past 500 ka, whereas hornblende content decreases to < 10% in strata older than similar to 1 Ma in the central CLP because of diagenesis. In the present study we found that hornblende is the dominant heavy mineral in 2-2.7 Ma loess on the northeastern CLP (at Jiaxian), which today receives little precipitation. Conversely, hornblende content in the upper Miocene-Pliocene Red Clay at Jiaxian is < 10%, as in the central CLP. The early Quaternary abundance of hornblende at Jiaxian indicates that the current northwestward-decreasing precipitation pattern and consequent dry climate at Jiaxian must have been initiated since 2.7 Ma, preventing hornblende dissolution to amounts < 10% as observed in the central CLP. By contrast, the 7 Ma and 3 Ma Jiaxian Red Clay hornblende content is significantly less than that of the Xifeng samples, despite the fact that today Xifeng receives more precipitation than Jiaxian, with expected enhanced hornblende weathering. This suggests that the northeastern CLP received more precipitation during the Late Miocene-Pliocene than at Xifeng, indicating that the precipitation gradient on the CLP was more east west during the Late Miocene-Pliocene rather than northwest southeast as it was in the Quaternary. A comparison of magnetic susceptibility records for these sections confirms this inference. We attribute this major change in climatic patterns at 2.7 Ma to decreased northward moisture transportation associated with Northern Hemisphere glaciation and cooling in the Quaternary. This study therefore demonstrates the potential usefulness of employing heavy mineral analysis in both paleoclimatic and paleooceanographic reconstructions.
