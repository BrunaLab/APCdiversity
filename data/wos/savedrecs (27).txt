AB OBJECTIVE: Primary intracranial Ewing sarcoma (ES)/peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumors (pPNETs) are extremely rare, and only a few studies have reported >4 cases of this disease. The purpose of this study was to explore the clinical features, treatment, and outcome of primary intracranial ES/pPNETs.
   METHODS: The clinical data of 14 patients who had been surgically treated from February 2003 to November 2017 and in whom immunohistochemical staining results had confirmed the diagnosis of primary intracranial ES/pPNETs were retrospectively analyzed. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to estimate the survival rate and the median survival time (MST).
   RESULTS: Gross total resection (GTR) was achieved in 7 cases, and subtotal resection was performed in 7 cases. During follow-up, 10 (71.4%) patients had local recurrence and 3 (21.4%) patients had distant metastasis. The overall 1-, 2-, and 5-year survival rates were 78.6%, 47.6%, and 19.0%, respectively. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that postoperative radiotherapy was a significant prognostic factor for longer MST (P = 0.034). GTR and radiotherapy with or without adjuvant chemotherapy yielded the highest 2-year survival rate (100%). Three patients who underwent GTR, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy had the highest 2-year survival rates (100%) and the longest MST (48 months).
   CONCLUSIONS: Primary intracranial ES/pPNETs have an aggressive clinical course, with a high tendency for local recurrence and distant metastasis. Radiotherapy plays a significant role in improving the survival of patients. GTR combined with radiotherapy and chemotherapy may be the most beneficial treatment modality.

AB BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The prognosis of progressive ischemic stroke (PIS) caused by large proximal artery occlusion with hemodynamic was poor. Our study aimed to investigate the safety of endovascular therapy (ET) for patients with PIS who were selected based on ischemic penumbra detected on brain imaging.
   METHODS: A cohort of consecutive patients with PIS, who were treated with ET, were identified. Patients were selected for ET based on the presence of ischemic penumbra using magnetic resonance imaging. Clinical outcome includes 90-day modified Rankin scale, mortality, and symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) rate. Multivariate analysis was performed to compare treatment time of <= 6 hours (early) with >6 hours (late) after stroke.
   RESULTS: One hundred forty-eight patients were treated (100 early and 48 late). Compared with the early group, more successful recanalization rate in the late group (100% vs. 89%, P = 0.017), lower mortality (2.1% vs. 12%, P = 0.046), better clinical outcome (modified Rankin scale score <= 2, 81.3% vs. 65%, P = 0.046), and sICH rate was similar between the 2 groups (7.0% vs. 9.5%, P = 1.00). Only pretreatment National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score (odds ratio [OR] = 0.836, P = 0.025), successful recanalization (OR = 7.077, P = 0.038), collateral status (OR = 3.121, P = 0.016), and sICH (OR = 0.053, P = 0.013) were predictors of a good prognosis.
   CONCLUSIONS: In appropriately selected patients with PIS, ET can be performed safely. Furthermore, randomized clinical trials are needed to assess its effectiveness.

AB BACKGROUND: We retrospectively analyzed and report the clinical results of percutaneous endoscopic lumbar discectomy (PELD) in treating patients with calcified lumbar intervertebral disc herniation (CLDH).
   METHODS: The data from 40 patients with CLDH treated with PELD in our hospital from June 2013 to June 2017 were reviewed. Of the 40 patients, 27 (19 men; 8 women; average age, 45.5 +/- 7.5 years) had undergone percutaneous endoscopic transforaminal discectomy and 13 (8 men, 5 women; average age, 46.9 +/- 6.9 years) had undergone percutaneous endoscopic interlaminar discectomy. The Peak method was used for both groups. The preoperative demographic data of both groups were analyzed. The pre- and postoperative leg visual analog scale scores and Oswestry disability index were compared and complications were evaluated.
   RESULTS: All procedures were performed successfully, and follow-up data were obtained for all patients for 24 months. The leg visual analog scale and Oswestry disability index scores at the last follow-up visit had decreased in both groups and were significantly different statistically from the preoperative data. No nerve root injury, intestinal injury, intervertebral disc infection, or recurrence was detected in any patient. Dural tear and cerebrospinal fluid leakage were observed in 3 patients (2, percutaneous endoscopic transforaminal discectomy; 1, percutaneous endoscopic interlaminar discectomy), because of adhesions between the calcification and nerve root. However, their symptoms resolved, and they were discharged after 1 week of bed rest.
   CONCLUSIONS: With the application of Peak philosophy, PELD is safe and effective in treating patients with CLDH. The use of PELD results in good neurological recovery, pain relief, and a low incidence of complications.

AB BACKGROUND: Artery stenting is an effective therapy for carotid artery stenosis to prevent ischemic stroke. We aimed to identify and analyze the 100 top-cited reports on carotid artery stenting (CAS) to review the achievements and developments in this field.
   METHODS: The Web of Knowledge database was searched from its inception up to May 3, 2018, using the terms "carotid artery stenting" and "CAS." The 100 most-cited reports were extracted to analyze their characteristics.
   RESULTS: The number of citations for the 100 most-cited reports ranged from 120 to 1813, with an accumulated citation number of 26,265. These reports were from 13 countries, with the most publications from the United States (n = 62), followed by the United Kingdom (n = 11), Germany (n = 6), and Italy (n = 6). Stroke (n = 21) was the lead-producing journal, followed by the Journal of Vascular Surgery (n = 11) and Journal of the American College of Cardiology (n = 10). Those reports with a greater impact factor were likely to be cited more often (P < 0.0001). These reports were categorized as clinical trial (n = 74), review (n = 13), basic study (n = 5), guideline (n = 5), commentary (n = 1), expert consensus (n = 1), and protocol (n = 1).
   CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study provide scientific data for CAS. The United States contributed the most reports. Stroke was the lead productive journal. Those reports with a greater impact factor were likely to be cited more often.

ID HEALTH-ORGANIZATION CLASSIFICATION; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM
AB BACKGROUND: Pineal parenchymal tumors of intermediate differentiation (PPTIDs) are rare lesions with particular features compared with other pineal parenchymal tumors.
   METHODS: We present a retrospective review of patients with histologically confirmed PPTIDs who were operated on in our department between 1997 and 2015. A demographic analysis and an evaluation of preoperative status, surgical treatment, as well as immediate and long-term clinical and radiologic outcomes were conducted.
   RESULTS: Fifteen patients with PPTIDs were operated on between 1997 and 2015. Gross total removal was achieved in 11 cases; 2 patients underwent near-total resection, 1 partial resection, and 1 received brachytherapy after an endoscopic biopsy. Nine patients required external radiation therapy (4 due to a pleomorphic histology of their lesion including pineoblastoma features in 3 of them; 3 after a subtotal resection; and 2 for tumor recurrence). No patient received chemotherapy. The survival rate of our patients was 57.1% at a mean follow-up of 137.2 +/- 77.6 months (39-248 months).
   CONCLUSIONS: A proper multidisciplinary management of PPTIDs based on a gross total removal of the lesion, and an adjuvant radiotherapy in selected cases, may improve the overall survival of these aggressive tumors.

   MYELOGRAPHY; PSEUDOMENINGOCELE; DIAGNOSIS
AB BACKGROUND: Cervical and upper thoracic nerve root avulsions are preganglionic lesions that occur after extreme traction of the brachial plexus. The tearing of the roots from the spinal cord pia leads, not only to immediate and permanent deficits, but also to delayed neurologic complications. Symptomatic myelopathy can present in a late fashion owing to chronic sequelae from the inciting traumatic event. No unifying theory has yet been provided that can explain the causes of delayed spinal cord dysfunction after preganglionic brachial plexus injury. We have proposed a collective mechanism for the development of delayed spinal cord injury.
   METHODS: An institutional database search and a literature review were performed to find patients who had presented with delayed myelopathy after brachial plexus injury.
   RESULTS: We found 454 adult patients with traumatic brachial plexus injury and spinal cord injury from 1997 to 2018 in the institutional search. Of these patients, 74 had a delayed presentation of new myelopathic findings on physical examination that had developed >= 6 months after the initial presentation. In these 74 patients with delayed myelopathic symptoms, radiologic findings of spinal cord herniation, syringomyelia, superficial siderosis, or pathologic intradural or extradural cerebrospinal fluid collections from traumatic dural tears were present. Each of these pathologic entities was present in isolation or combination in our patient population.
   CONCLUSIONS: Four overlapping etiologies appeared to compose the primary foundation for delayed spinal cord dysfunction after brachial plexus injury. We have highlighted this continuum by providing institutional case examples and a review of the reported data.

ID GUIDED SURGERY; RESECTION; MICROSCOPE
AB BACKGROUND: Minimally invasive surgery of small skull base meningiomas is technically challenging. We report the role of endoscopic 5-aminolevulinic acid fluorescence guidance (e-5-ALA-FGS) for small and deep-seated anterior skull base meningiomas.
   METHODS: We report the cases of 2 patients. The first case was a small olfactory groove meningioma resected via a trans-eyebrow, subfrontal approach. The second case was a clinoid meningioma with invasion of the optic canal resected via a small frontolateral approach. Intraoperative documentation demonstrated the usefulness of 5-ALA endoscopy. In either case, residual fluorescing tumor tissue was detected. No complication was encountered. The clinical and radiological outcomes were good. No regrowth had occurred after 54 and 17 months of follow-up, respectively.
   RESULTS: Residual meningioma tissue on the far side of a keyhole approach (e.g., in the olfactory groove or at the optic canal) can be difficult to visualize. Visualization can be improved by use of an endoscope. To date, fluorescence guidance with a microscope was limited by insufficient fluorescence signals in deep corridors. With a specially equipped 5-ALA fluorescence endoscope, one can combine the advantages of both endoscopic vision and fluorescence guidance. The results of present report have demonstrated the usefulness of 5-ALA endoscopy for difficult to visualize areas.
   CONCLUSION: Endoscopic 5-ALA fluorescence guidance was shown to be feasible when resecting small and deep-seated skull base meningiomas via minimally invasive approaches. Based on this proof of principle, we encourage its evaluation for the middle or posterior fossa (e.g., internal auditory canal) and other difficult areas (e.g., behind neurovascular structures or the brainstem). The sensitivity and specificity of this method should be prospectively and systematically investigated.

DT Article
DE Nerve grafting; Nerve regeneration; Peripheral nerve
ID NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR; EXPRESSION; NEURONS; LESIONS; INDEX
AB BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that reneurorrhaphy of a distal coaptation at an appropriate time after nerve grafting can upregulate neurotrophins in rat spinal cord neurons. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect this procedure has on peripheral nerve regeneration.
   METHODS: Fifteen Wistar rats were randomly assigned to sham-surgery, control, or experimental (transection and rerepair of the distal coaptation of the grafting nerve) groups. The sciatic nerve was evaluated via electromyogram and histology at 20 weeks.
   RESULTS: When crossing the proximal coaptation of the grafting nerve, the electromyogram and histologic evaluations did not significantly differ between experimental and control groups (P > 0.05). In contrast, crossing the distal coaptation yielded significantly better values (P < 0.05) in the experimental group.
   CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that reneurorrhaphy of the distal coaptation at an appropriate time after nerve grafting can improve nerve function and facilitate the regeneration of axons.

AB BACKGROUND: The woven endobridge intrasaccular flow disruptor (WEB) device for ruptured broad-based intracranial aneurysm (rBBA) remains underrepresented in existing studies. In this case series, the safety and efficacy results of the use of WEB in rBBA were evaluated from a multi-center experience.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between November 2014 and October 2017, data of all patients with rBBA (>= 4 mm and/or dome/neck ratio >= 1 and >= 1.6) treated with WEB were prospectively collected and retrospectively analyzed from 3 Italian neurointerventional centers. The interventional procedures and the clinical and angiographic outcomes are reported for the periprocedural phase with midterm follow-up.
   RESULTS: 33 patients were included in this series (10 patients with Hunt-Hess scores 4-5; 23 patients with Hunt-Hess scores 1-3). Technical success was obtained for all 33 patients (100%). The mean fluoroscopy time was 24 minutes (range, 8-40 minutes). Adjunctive devices were used in 6% of patients (2 stents). At the 1-month follow-up visit, the overall mortality was 33%. The overall rate of WEB-related complications was 27% (5 device protrusion, 2 sac perforation, 2 thromboembolism), with a WEB-related mortality of 12% and permanent neurologic deficit of 3%. Of the surviving patients, 1 was lost to follow-up. At 14 months, the mean follow-up (range, 2-35 months), no early or delayed reruptured aneurysms were observed; complete occlusion was obtained in 7/21 patients (33%), neck remnant in 8/21 (38%), and residual aneurysm filling in 6/21 (29%) patients, with a modified Rankin Scale of 0sto 2 observed in 17/21 patients (80%).
   CONCLUSIONS: The WEB device for rBBA is a fast and effective treatment, with a low rate of aneurysm rebleeding; however, procedure-related complications seem not negligible. Further evaluation comparing this device with other treatment options should be performed.

   THERAPY; FLOW DIVERSION; ACUTE STROKE; ANEURYSMS; THROMBECTOMY;
   MULTICENTER
AB BACKGROUND: Randomized trials of commonly performed surgical interventions are notoriously difficult to conduct. The trial methodology may nevertheless be the best way to offer outcome-based neurovascular care in the presence of uncertainty. One obstacle to promoting such trials is the conventional prohibition of publication and dissemination of interim results as the trial progresses.
   METHODS: We review the scientific and statistical reasons against the publication of interim analyses as well as exceptions that can occur when 1 treatment is unexpectedly shown to be harmful or when the results of other trials have convincingly shown the comparative benefits of a new intervention. We also discuss the promotion of difficult surgical trials.
   RESULTS: Reasons to support the conventional ban on publication of interim results include control of statistical errors, prevention of invalid conclusions, and dissemination of false claims of equivalence of rival interventions. In the early phases of a trial, usually 1 treatment cannot be shown superior to the other. We believe, contrary to the received view, that a transparent report of the early progress of certain trials can be justified, even when interim results are inconclusive, to promote the recruitment of participating centers and the practice of a novel way to offer neurovascular care in the presence of uncertainty in the best medical interest of patients.
   CONCLUSIONS: In our opinion, the early publication of inconclusive interim results may increase awareness of the feasibility of surgical care trials.

AB OBJECTIVE: Fluorescence-guided glioblastoma surgery is an intraoperative technique developed in recent years. Two main compounds have been used so far: 5-amilovelulinic acid (5-ALA) and fluorescein sodium (Fl-Na). Despite a large amount of literature on both techniques, few data are available on the use of both compounds in the same patient.
   METHODS: Three consecutive patients affected by a newly diagnosed glioblastoma underwent surgical resection using both 5-ALA and Fl-Na. 5-ALA was orally administered 3 hours before induction of anesthesia at a dosage of 20 mg/kg, whereas fluorescein was intravenously administered at induction of anesthesia at a dosage of 4 mg/kg. Tumor resection was carried out combining these fluorophores. At tumor borders, multiple samples were collected, and fluorescent pattern of each sample was registered. Samples were then analyzed by a neuropathologist blinded for intraoperative fluorescence findings.
   RESULTS: Eighteen samples were analyzed. At tumor margin, bright pink fluorescence was highly indicative of residual tumor (positive predictive value [PPV], 94%), and it was superior to faint pink and fluorescein (PPVs, 89% and 87%, respectively). The gradual reduction of pink fluorescence warned of the risk of gradually entering healthy tissue (specificity of 67% compared with 33% with fluorescein). Using 5-ALA, detecting no fluorescence was highly suggestive of healthy tissue (negative predictive value of 100% compared with 50% with fluorescence).
   CONCLUSIONS: In our experience with 3 patients, the 2 techniques presented different advantages and limitations in specific steps of tumor resection, showing complementary properties. Larger studies are mandatory to investigate the synergistic use of both techniques.

TI Sex- and Sport-Specific Epidemiology of Cervical Spine Injuries
   Sustained During Sporting Activities
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Cervical spine; Epidemiology; Sports medicine; Trauma
ID UNITED-STATES; ICE HOCKEY; FRACTURES
AB BACKGROUND: Although several investigations have examined the epidemiology of cervical spine injuries in sports, few studies have analyzed the nationwide incidence and sex-specific epidemiology of cervical spine injuries.
   METHOD: The National Electronic Injury Surveillance System database, which collects information on patients presenting to the emergency department at 100 hospitals across the United States, was queried for neck sprains and cervical fractures associated with sporting activities from 2000-2015.
   RESULT: A total of 26,380 neck sprains and 1166 fractures were identified. Compared with females, the incidence for injuries in males was 1.7 times greater for neck sprains and 3.6 times greater for fractures (P < 0.0001). Football was the most common cause of cervical sprains in males, followed by cycling and weightlifting/aerobics. Females sustained most neck sprains in weightlifting/aerobics, trampoline, and cheerleading. From 2000 to 2015, the incidence of neck sprains from aerobics increased from 15.5 to 25.3 per million person-years (P < 0.0001). Similarly, the incidence of cervical fractures from cycling increased from 0.67 to 2.7 per million (P < 0.0001). For males, cycling was the most common cause of fracture, followed by diving/swimming and football. For females, horseback riding was most common, followed by cycling and diving/swimming.
   CONCLUSIONS: Football is the leading cause of cervical sprains in the United States. The most common cause of cervical fracture in men is cycling, while in women it is horseback riding. The incidence of sport-related cervical fractures has increased by 35% from 2000 to 2015, which has been driven by an increase in cycling-related injuries.

AB OBJECTIVE: To present a case of spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) otorrhea from a fallopian canal meningocele involving the geniculate fossa and review all cases of fallopian canal CSF leak reported in the literature with discussion of management and outcomes.
   METHODS: A 53-year-old woman with history of morbid obesity and hypertension presented to a tertiary care referral center with unilateral high-volume CSF otorrhea. High-resolution temporal bone computed tomography demonstrated significant dilatation of the geniculate fossa. Rates of postoperative facial paralysis and refractory CSF leak were reported for the present case and prior cases reported in the literature.
   RESULTS: Locations of fallopian canal dehiscence, surgical approaches, techniques for packing dehiscence, rates of postoperative facial paralysis and CSF leak, and revision procedures were reported for the present case and 14 cases in the literature. The present case involved dehiscence of the geniculate fossa that was approached via combined transmastoide-middle cranial fossa exploration with facial nerve monitoring. The area of dehiscence was carefully packed with temporalis fascia, muscle, and artificial dural substitute overlay to repair the CSF leak without injuring the facial nerve. Postoperatively, no facial weakness was noted; however, right-sided high-volume CSF otorrhea persisted. After discussing treatment options, the patient underwent subtotal petrosectomy and blind-sac closure of the external auditory canal the following day. This successfully resolved the CSF leak without causing facial nerve weakness.
   CONCLUSIONS: Fallopian canal meningocele is an exceedingly rare cause of CSF otorrhea. Successful repair requires precise packing of the dilated facial canal to occlude the leak without injuring the facial nerve. For refractory CSF leak, subtotal petrosectomy and closure of the external auditory canal warrants consideration.

AB BACKGROUND: First carpometacarpal (CMC) joint osteoarthritis (OA) is commonly encountered in clinical practice. The preferred surgical option when conservative therapy fails varies with the stage and nature of the disease. Denervation of the first CMC joint is a relatively new procedure for managing stable thumb CMC joint OA. Our objective was to review our experience and surgical technique with first CMC joint denervation surgery.
   METHODS: All patients who underwent first CMC joint denervation surgery from January 2015 through September 2017 were retrospectively identified. Before undergoing surgical CMC denervation, patients received a joint block at the first CMC joint with 0.25% bupivacaine. Only patients with a good response to injection were selected for surgical denervation. Patient demographics, preoperative and postoperative pain scores using a numeric rating scale, and grip strength using the Jamar Hydraulic Hand Dynamometer were analyzed.
   RESULTS: Of 10 patients (13 hands) with CMC joint OA, 8 patients (11 hands) met the inclusion criteria. Patients' average grip strength improved significantly after the procedure (from 38.4 +/- 26.7 foot/lb to 50.2 +/- 27.6 foot/lb; P = 0.007). The numeric rating scale pain score improved significantly from 7.8 +/- 2.4 to 2.4 +/- 1.8 (P < 0.001). Seven of 8 patients reported satisfaction with surgery. There were 2 complications.
   CONCLUSIONS: First CMC joint denervation provided good pain relief and improvement in grip strength in patients with thumb CMC joint OA. This minimally invasive technique proved to be a good option for providing optimal pain control and improvement in strength with minimal and mild complications.

ID FORAMINOTOMY; ANTERIOR; FUSION; DISKECTOMY; EXPERIENCE; HERNIATION;
   DISEASE
AB BACKGROUND: The main concern with the posterior approach is the risk of postoperative segmental instability. The most commonly cited rule is that removal of the medial half of the articular facet provides adequate surgical exposure and has no effect on stability. The aim of this study was to define the areas of the articular processes in the cervical spine that can be safely removed.
   METHODS: Computed tomography scans of 50 cervical spines were analyzed. Measurements were analyzed for bone removal assuming the standard technique of posterior laminoforaminotomy. The width of the facet was measured at the level of the widest dimension. The height of the articular process was taken from the bottom (in the case of inferior process) or top (in the case of superior process) of the process.
   RESULTS: The mean width of the articular process ranged from 11.8 +/- 1.5 mm (range, 8.3-15.7 mm) at the C2-C3 level to 14.6 +/- 1.7 mm at the C6-C7 level. At the cervicothoracic junction (C7-T1 level), the mean width decreased to 14.0 +/- 1.7 mm. The mean value for both sides when the inferior articular process was measured at all levels was 5.0 +/- 1.4 mm (range, 4.5-5.8 mm). The mean height of the superior articular process was 7.7 +/- 1.5 mm (range, 6.8-8.3 mm).
   CONCLUSIONS: Based on our findings, our "5-5-7 mm rule" corresponds to the amount of bone removal for each step of the laminoforaminotomy.

ID PEDIATRIC AGE GROUP; DIAGNOSIS; CLASSIFICATION; DIVERTICULA
AB BACKGROUND: Spinal arachnoid cysts (SACs) are uncommon lesions in the spinal canal. They are usually asymptomatic, but can occasionally cause mass effect leading to neurologic symptoms. They can be congenital or secondary to a variety of causes. They can produce a variety of neurologic symptoms including pain, weakness, sensory changes, incontinence, and more. Surgical intervention may be necessary when SACs cause symptomatic mass effect.
   METHODS: Thirteen consecutive patients who underwent surgical intervention for an SAC were retrospectively reviewed. The data included presenting symptoms, imaging findings, neurologic status, and follow-up.
   RESULTS: Of the 13 patients, the majority of cases were located in the thoracic spine (54%) and all but one case were located dorsally or dorsolaterally. Furthermore, 38% were located extradurally and 54% were located intradurally. Pain (80%) was the most common presenting symptom. Most patients had improvement or complete resolution of their symptoms after intervention. Extradural SACs and their capsules were completely resected, whereas intradural SACs underwent fenestration. No complications occurred in this series.
   CONCLUSIONS: SACs are usually asymptomatic, but rarely cause mass effect and neurologic deficits requiring surgical intervention. Surgical intervention is tailored to the position of the cysts' dorsal or ventral locations. Pain and weakness are the most likely symptoms to improve, whereas sensory symptoms are least likely to improve.

TI Selection Strategy for Optimal Keyhole Approaches for Middle Cerebral

ID EXPERIENCE; SURGERY; MCA
AB BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: The lateral supraorbital (LS) and minipterional (MP) approaches have been reported for treating intracranial aneurysms as alternative to the pterional approach. We describe our decision making for selecting the minicraniotomy, LS versus MP, for managing noncomplex aneurysms of the middle cerebral artery (MCA), based on the depth of the aneurysm within the Sylvian fissure.
   METHODS: We report on a consecutive case series of 50 patients who underwent clipping of 54 ruptured/unruptured MCA aneurysms by means of LS or MP craniotomies. The distance between the MCA (M1) origin and the aneurysmal neck is key to selection of the approach: LS was used for MCA aneurysms < 15 mm from the M1 origin and MP for MCA aneurysms >= 15 mm from the M1 origin.
   RESULTS: 11 of 50 patients presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage (10 ruptured MCA aneurysms). Overall, 59 aneurysms were successfully clipped (54 of the MCA). The mean distance between the M1 origin and the aneurysmal neck was 10.1 mm (range, 4-17 mm) for patients treated by LS and 20 mm (range, 15-30 mm) for those treated by MP. All but 1 MCA aneurysms were successfully treated. At last follow-up (mean, 14 months), no reperfusion of the clipped aneurysms was observed.
   CONCLUSION: Our strategy for selecting the keyhole approach based on the depth of the aneurysm within the Sylvian fissure is efficient and safe. We suggest the use of the LS approach when the aneurysm is < 15 mm from the M1 origin and the MP approach when the aneurysm is >= 15 mm from the M1 origin.

AB BACKGROUND: Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion with a porous tantalum cage is an accepted method to treat degenerated cervical discs, with good results, similar to those with autologous bone graft and plating at short- and mid-term follow-up. However, to date, long-term follow-up studies have been performed.
   METHODS: We performed a retrospective, single-center study to evaluate the outcomes of 2 cohorts from a previous prospective randomized controlled trial comparing stand-alone tantalum cage (group 1, 27 patients) with autologous bone graft and plating (group 2, 30 patients) for single-level anterior cervical discectomy and fusion at 11 years of follow-up. The usual clinical and radiological outcomes and "overall success," proposed by the Food and Drug Administration, were evaluated.
   RESULTS: The improvement in clinical outcomes achieved postoperatively was maintained similarly in the 2 cohorts at 11 years of follow-up. In group 1, the cage had subsided 2e3 mm in 12 patients (44%), segmental lordosis was maintained in 16 patients (59%), adjacent segment degeneration had developed or progressed in 27 of the adjacent segments (50%) in 15 patients (56%), and postoperative nonprogressive deformation of the anterior aspect of the cage was observed in 7 (26%) and minor fragmentation in 3 (11%) patients. In group 2, segmental lordosis was maintained in 90% of the patients and adjacent segment degeneration had developed or progressed in 15 patients (50%).
   CONCLUSIONS: These results show that the clinical and radiological outcomes achieved at mid-term follow-up using a tantalum cage for single-level anterior cervical discectomy and fusion will be maintained for 11 years postoperatively, similar to the results with autologous bone graft and plating.

AB OBJECTIVE: Given the lack of significant responses to many queries regarding behavior, treatment options, and possible prevention of iatrogenic intraspinal inclusion tumors (IITs), we think that further clinical, radiologic, and follow-up data are mandatory to better characterize this entity. We retrospectively reviewed a series of 14 consecutive patients with IIT occurring after myelomeningocele repair. The long follow-up is a mainstay of this series and may help a better understanding of the history of this slow-growing disease. To date, this is the largest series of IITs after myelomeningocele repair reported in the literature.
   METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed to identify all cases of surgically repaired myelomeningocele at the Department of Neurosurgery of G. Gaslini Children's Hospital in Genoa, from January 1993 to January 2018. Among them, data regarding patients in whom an IIT developed were recovered. The medical records of these patients and their clinical history, neurologic examination, and diagnostic workup were reviewed.
   RESULTS: From January 1993 to January 2018, 160 cases of myelomeningocele were surgically treated. Among them, 14 cases of IIT developed. The mean time between myelomeningocele repair and IIT diagnosis was 94.7 months. The mean follow-up time was 60.1 months.
   CONCLUSIONS: It is well established that IITs may be discovered in patients who have previously undergone myelomeningocele repair. In our series, with a long follow-up time, we describe the possible range of behavior of such lesions and the utility of surgical treatment of primary therapy. Our series confirms that residual IITs showed marked stability during our long follow-up.

ID LOCALIZATION; MANAGEMENT; SERIES
AB OBJECTIVE: Dorsal intradural arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) consist of a direct connection between a radicular feeding artery and the coronal venous plexus; this direct connection leads to arterialization of the venous plexus, venous congestion, and myelopathy. Controversy still exists regarding the best treatment modality of spinal dural AVFs. Surgical disconnection of spinal dural AVFs is a straight-forward procedure with a high success rate and virtually no risk of recurrence or incomplete treatment.
   To identify factors associated with the clinical progression of dorsal intradural AVFs and quantify the range of surgical outcomes in terms of neurologic improvement as well as patients' perception of quality of life (QOL).
   METHODS: A retrospective observational study of 19 consecutive patients treated with surgery over a 10-year period was carried out. We analyzed surgical results and clinical outcomes. We also evaluated the impact of this disease and its sequelae on the patients' postoperative health-related QOL.
   RESULTS: The surgical procedure showed good results in terms of neurologic improvement as well as patients' perception of QOL.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our series confirmed that surgical obliteration of dorsal intradural AVFs is an effective and safe procedure. The results of this retrospective analysis make us believe that surgery, given its low morbidity and high success rate, represents a safe and effective first therapeutic option for these spinal vascular malformations. It could be considered to avoid unsuccessful endovascular attempts that could delay the definitive treatment of this disease. The surgical procedure showed good results in terms of neurologic improvement as well as patients' perception of QOL.

AB BACKGROUND: The evolution of minimally invasive endovascular approaches and training paradigms has reduced open neurovascular case exposure for neurosurgical residents. There are no published estimates of open neurovascular case volumes during residency or Committee on Advanced Subspecialty Training (CAST) accredited fellowships.
   METHODS: Case volumes from residency programs submitting data for CAST accredited fellowship applications were collected and analyzed. The study period covered the academic years of 2013-2016. Case index volumes were calculated to provide an estimate of total volume of cases each trainee participated in a given year. The case index volume was defined as the total volume of cases per year divided by the total training complement.
   RESULTS: Over the study period, institutional data from 46 programs were available. Of those programs, 9 programs had CAST accredited open cerebrovascular fellowships. Across all 46 programs, the median number of vascular cases was 246 (interquartile range [IQR]: 148-340), whereas the median number of open vascular cases was 105 (IQR: 67-152). The median number of open aneurysm cases among programs with CAST cerebrovascular fellowships was 80 (IQR: 54-103) and among programs without CAST cerebrovascular fellowships was 34 (IQR: 24-63). The median open aneurysm case index volume for trainees at programs with and without CAST cerebrovascular fellowships was 23 (IQR: 14-29) and 19 (IQR: 11-24).
   CONCLUSIONS: Strong neurovascular training can be obtained through dedication and planning. Completion of a CAST accredited cerebrovascular fellowship will often more than double aneurysm case exposure of trainees.

DT Article
DE Brain tumor; Complications; CT scan; Elective craniotomy
ID HEAD CT; RESECTION; RECOVERY; GLIOMA; RECONSTRUCTION; QUALITY
AB BACKGROUND: Next-day postoperative computed tomography (CT) has been routinely used to obtain radiographic "clearance" for transferring patients after elective craniotomy out of the intensive care unit. The value of this traditional policy, however, has repeatedly been questioned. However, the limited patient numbers might have underestimated the very rare, but catastrophic, events. Therefore, we analyzed the value of routine postoperative CT in a larger cohort of elective tumor, epilepsy, and vascular cases.
   METHODS: All the patients who had undergone elective craniotomy were included in our study. The routine postoperative CT scans were analyzed by a neuroradiologist who was unaware of the clinical data. The medical records were retrospectively reviewed for events of arterial hypertension and clinical deterioration.
   RESULTS: The data from 660 patients with tumors (n = 393; 59.5%), aneurysms (n = 107; 16.2%), and skull base lesions were evaluated. In nearly one half of the patients (n = 264; 45.8%), CT depicted the presence of blood that was not associated with symptoms. Of the 660 patients, 21 (3.6%) showed a mass effect radiographically, 11 of whom underwent revision surgery. Arterial hypertension was documented in only 8 patients (1.3%) and was related to the revision surgery (P = 0.018). The overall revision rate was 2.7% (n = 18). All patients who had undergone revision for postoperative hematoma had presented with a new neurological deficit immediately before CT.
   CONCLUSION: Routine postoperative CT did not reveal 1 patient with a serious hematoma that would not have been identified by clinical examination. Patients could be transferred safely from the intensive care unit, if the weaning process and clinical observation findings were uneventful, without deterioration of neurological symptoms or consciousness.

AB OBJECTIVE: To date, no standard surgical procedure has been proven effective for intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), particularly deep hematomas. This retrospective study evaluated the effectiveness and safety of endoscopic surgery, minimally invasive puncture and drainage, and craniotomy for treating moderate basal ganglia ICH.
   METHODS: Patients with basal ganglia ICH (N = 177) were divided into 3 groups based on therapeutic intervention as follows: endoscopic surgery group (n = 61), minimally invasive puncture and drainage group (n = 60), and craniotomy group (n = 56). Patient characteristics at admission were recorded. Operative time; blood loss during operation; evacuation rate; postoperative complications secondary to perihematomal edema, including rebleeding, infectious meningitis, pulmonary infection, gastrointestinal bleeding, and epilepsy; mortality; and Glasgow Outcome Scale scores were compared among the 3 groups.
   RESULTS: Minimally invasive puncture and drainage was the least traumatic procedure and had the shortest operative time, but it could not remove the hematoma quickly; moreover, it had the highest rebleeding rate. Craniotomy was effective in removing the hematoma but resulted in marked trauma and had the highest incidence of pulmonary infection. Endoscopic surgery was safer and more effective than the other 2 surgical methods, with greater improvement in neurologic outcomes and no change in mortality.
   CONCLUSIONS: Minimally invasive neuroendoscopic management has the advantages of direct vision, efficient hematoma evacuation, and relatively good results. Endoscopic surgery may be a more promising approach for the treatment of moderate basal ganglia ICH.

Six (20%) patients had intracompartimental lesions (Tomita 1-3), whereas 24 (80%) patients had extracompartimental lesions (Tomita 4-7), with extensive anterior column involvement. All patients were surgically treated with laminectomy and posterior stabilization. Pain and neurologic function were evaluated before and after surgery.
   RESULTS:Thirty patients were included (15 female, 15 male), with a mean age of 60.6 +/- 11.56 years (range 35-82 years). Lesions were located in 7 patients (23.3%) in the upper cervical spine and in 14 patients (46.6%) and in 9 patients (30,1%) in the mid-cervical and in the cervicothoracic junction, respectively. At a mean follow up of 13.7 +/- 14.8 months, 15 (50%) patients died from their disease. Pain decreased in all patients after surgery, (preoperative NRS 5.57 +/- 1.81 postoperative Numeric Rating Scale of 2.1 +/- 1.0, P < 0.00001). Two patients (6.7%) had significant neurologic worsening after surgery. Two (6.9%) patients had surgical-site infection that required reintervention. No mechanical failures were observed.
   CONCLUSIONS:In our series, posterior-only fixation provided postoperative pain relief and achieve spinal stability, ultimately improving the quality of life. In conclusion, posterior-approach decompression and stabilization is a safe and feasible procedure in patients with neurologic or mechanical instability for cervical spine metastasis.

AB OBJECTIVE: To present a long-term clinical and radiographic comparison between the Prestige LP cervical disc replacement and the Zero-P spacer cervical disc fusion in the treatment of patients with symptomatic 2-level cervical degenerative disease.
   METHODS: In total, 36 patients in the anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) group and 24 patients in the cervical disc arthroplasty (CDA) group were analyzed before surgery and at 1 week and 3, 6, 12, 24, and 60 months after surgery. Clinical assessments included the Japanese Orthopaedic Association score, visual analog scale, and Neck Disability Index scores. Radiographic assessments included cervical lordosis, range of motion (ROM) of the total cervical spine, functional spinal unit (FSU), and superior and inferior adjacent segments. Complications including heterotopic ossification and adjacent-segment degeneration (ASD) at 5-year follow-up were collected as well.
   RESULTS: Mean follow-up period was 65.6 months. Both the ACDF and CDA groups showed significant clinical improvements in terms of Japanese Orthopaedic Association score, visual analog scale, and Neck Disability Index (P < 0.05), but there was no significant difference between groups at the last follow-up period. A significant increase of cervical lordosis was observed in the CDA group after surgery whereas a significant difference was not observed between groups. ROM of the total cervical spine and FSU were maintained during the follow-up, and a significant decrease was observed in the ACDF group after surgery (P < 0.05). The ROM of the superior adjacent segment did not show any difference whereas the ROM of the inferior adjacent segment in the ACDF group presented a significant increase at 6 months and 1 year after surgery and a significant decrease at the last follow-up period. A total of 8 (33.3%) patients in the CDA group had an occurrence of heterotopic ossification. ASD was observed in 2 (8.3%) patients who underwent CDA surgery and 8 (22.2%) patients who underwent ACDF surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: The use of the Prestige-LP and ZERO-P Spacer implantations is safe and effective. At 5 years after surgery, CDA with Prestige-LP is superior in terms of ROM of the total cervical spine, FSU, and inferior adjacent segment. It also has a relatively low occurrence rate of ASD. This procedure may be a suitable choice for the treatment of contiguous 2-level CDDD.

AB BACKGROUND: With the aging population in the United States, it can be anticipated that the prevalence of spinal cord injuries (SCIs) and cancer will increase. Primary or metastatic spine tumors sit at a unique intersection of these 2 realms. Our objective was to evaluate the prevalence, outcomes, and complications after the management of SCI arising from spinal tumors.
   METHODS: In the present retrospective evaluation, all patients with SCI and a diagnosis of primary or metastatic spinal cancer who had been admitted to the inpatient rehabilitation unit at a level 1 trauma center from January 2003 to January 2014 were evaluated. The demographic data (age, sex, race/ethnicity), tumor characteristics, American Spinal Injury Association score, and complications were evaluated.
   RESULTS: A total of 757 SCI entries were identified, and 685 unique patients met our inclusion criteria. Of those, 81 had SCIs due to spinal tumors (11.8% of all SCIs and 19.2% of nontraumatic SCIs). Most tumors were located in the thoracic region (65.4%) and were primary central nervous system in origin (21.0%), including meningioma (7.4%), schwannoma (3.7%), and ependymoma (2.5%). The next most common origins of the spinal tumors were metastases from the lung (17.3%), prostate (9.9%), kidney (8.6%), lymphoma (7.4%), and multiple myeloma (7.4%). Of these patients, 76.5% underwent surgical management, with a complications rate of 61.3%. The overall mortality rate at the latest follow-up examination was 63.0%.
   CONCLUSIONS: SCI associated with spinal tumor is often managed surgically and associated with high rates of complications. The present study has demonstrated longer survival rates compared with the existing data.

   Training and Innovation of Future Surgical Strategies for Giant
   Aneurysms
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Anastomosis; Bypass; Cerebral aneurysm; Experimental model
ID MODEL; SIMULATION
AB BACKGROUND: With the development of endovascular neurosurgery, fewer patients have been requiring surgery, and those who do require surgery have more complex cases. Thus, neurosurgeons better trained in micro-neurosurgery and clipping skills are needed.
   METHODS: From 2014 to 2017, we built 296 aneurysms models from vessels harvested from chicken wings. The aneurysm models were created by anastomosing segments of arteries and veins with the same aneurysmal geometry and vascular relationships as in actual cases, using 3-dimensional computed tomography angiography. The models were injected with saline using a continuous infusion system, and different clipping techniques were attempted by different neurosurgeons. We have also described new technical solution for treatment of giant aneurysms, a surgical method that excludes them from flux using microsurgical endovascular bypass.
   RESULTS: We have described, in detail, the design for building middle cerebral artery, posterior communicating artery, anterior communicating artery, and basilar tip aneurysm models. All aneurysm models were patent, with no leakage points and with a good resemblance to the 3-dimensional computed tomography angiographic images that had served as the basis for the models. The aneurysm models were successfully clipped using different techniques. The neurosurgeons that trained on the aneurysm model before surgery found this experience useful.
   CONCLUSIONS: Aneurysm models respecting the real-case aneurysmal geometry provide a good training method for learning and preparing for surgery.

ID LUMBAR INTERBODY FUSION; EXPOSURE; FLUOROSCOPY; NAVIGATION
AB BACKGROUND: Visualization of the anatomy in minimally invasive surgery (MIS) of the spine is limited and dependent on radiographic imaging, leading to increased radiation exposure to patients and surgical staff. Ultra-low-radiation imaging (ULRI) with image enhancement is a novel technology that may reduce radiation in the operating room. The aim of this study was to compare radiation emission between standard-dose and ULRI fluoroscopy with image enhancement in patients undergoing MIS of the spine.
   METHODS: This study prospectively enrolled 60 consecutive patients who underwent lateral lumbar interbody fusion, lateral lumbar interbody fusion with percutaneous pedicle screws, or MIS transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion. Standard-dose fluoroscopy was used in 31 cases, and ULRI with image enhancement was used in 29 cases. All imaging emission and radiation doses were recorded.
   RESULTS: Radiation emission per level was significantly less with ULRI than with standard-dose fluoroscopy for lateral lumbar interbody fusion (36.4 mGy vs. 119.8 mGy, P < 0.001), per screw placed in lateral lumbar interbody fusion (15.4 mGy per screw vs. 47.1 mGy per screw, P < 0.001), and MIS transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (24.4 mGy vs. 121.6 mGy, P = 0.003). These differences represented reductions in radiation emission of 69.6%, 67.3%, and 79.9%. Total radiation doses per case were also significantly decreased for the transpsoas approach by 68.8%, lateral lumbar interbody fusion with percutaneous pedicle screws by 65.8%, and MIS transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion by 81.0% (P ? 0.004).
   CONCLUSIONS :ULRI with image enhancement has the capacity to significantly decrease radiation emission in minimally invasive procedures without compromising visualization of anatomy or procedure safety.

AB OBJECTIVE: The main objective was to compare estimated walking perimeter (WP) and actual WP during a free walking test (6-minute walk test [6MWT]) in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS). The second objective was to describe the correlation between measured gait parameters and functional parameters.
   METHODS: This was a single-center prospective study including 38 patients with symptomatic LSS (23 men, 15 women; mean age, 69.3 +/- 7.9 years). The intervention was the 6MWT. For the main outcome measure, patients were first asked to verbally estimate their WP. Then, WP was evaluated using a 6MWT at a self-selected speed. In the absence of need to stop, and if a distance of 500 m was not reached, the test was extended to this distance. Specific functional scores (Oswestry Disability Index and Quebec Back Pain Disability Scale) were recorded, and a quality of life questionnaire was completed.
   RESULTS: WP was estimated to be less than 500 m in 21 of 38 patients, but only 7 patients actually stopped walking before reaching 500 m. The median estimate error in these patients was 200 m (interquartile range, 65-250). The shorter the estimated distance was, the greater the estimation error (r = -0.63, P = 0.002). The average walking speed was slow. Functional parameters (Oswestry Disability Index and Quebec Back Pain Disability Scale) were weakly and inversely correlated with real WP (r = -0.44 and r = -0.31, respectively) and moderately inversely correlated with measured walking speed (r = -0.51, P <= 0.001 for both).
   CONCLUSIONS: Direct measurement of free walking speed should be considered as a valid functional assessment in current practice for patients with LSS instead of estimated WP. To assist therapeutic decision-making, the most relevant type of walking test (duration, distance, velocity) needs to be determined.

AB INTRODUCTION: Magnetic resonance-guided laser interstitial thermal therapy (MRgLITT) and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) are 2 emerging minimally invasive procedures being increasingly used for surgical intervention in cases of medically intractable temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). To date, no comparative analyses of these 2 procedures have been made. In the current study, we synthesized pooled data from existing studies in an attempt to present a systematic review and meta-analysis of seizure and clinical outcomes of the 2 procedures in patients with TLE.
   METHODS: The Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome (PICO) approach and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines were followed to perform an indirect meta-analysis of seizure and clinical outcomes between MRgLITT and SRS. Only studies reporting outcomes for patients with TLE were included in the current review.
   RESULTS: A total of 19 studies were included in the final analysis, giving a total of 415 TLE patients. Of those studies, 9 were on MRgLITT, with a total of 250 patients (60%), and 10 were on SRS, with a total of 165 patients (40%). We found that the overall seizure freedom rate was comparable between the 2 procedures (MRgLITT 50%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 44% to 56%, vs. SRS 42%, 95% CI 27% to 59%, P = 0.39). Similarly, among patients with lesional pathologic conditions only, the seizure freedom rate was comparable between the 2 procedures (MRgLITT 62%, 95% CI 48% to 74%, vs. SRS 50%, 95% CI 37% to 64%, P = 0.23). Compared with SRS, MRgLITT was associated with lower complication rates (MRgLITT 20%, 95% CI 14% to 26% vs. SRS 32%, 95% CI 20% to 46%, P = 0.06) but similar reoperation rates (15%, 95% CI 9% to 22% vs. 27%, 95% CI 12% to 46%, P = 0.31).
   CONCLUSIONS: As minimally invasive procedures continue to gain popularity for use in surgery for epilepsy, it is imperative to evaluate their efficacy and safety outcomes. In this study we pooled the data from existing studies to compare the seizure and clinical outcomes in patients with TLE undergoing MRgLITT and SRS. We found similar outcomes and complications between the 2 procedures.

ID ENDOVASCULAR EMBOLIZATION; FLOW DIVERTORS
AB BACKGROUND: Thromboembolic complications are serious adverse events associated with stenting of intracranial aneurysms. For the development of novel devices, currently no practical model exists to evaluate distal embolic events. The purpose of the current study was 2-fold: 1) assess the feasibility of a porcine carotid bifurcation model for in vivo testing of stent thrombogenicity and 2) compare the thrombogenicity of the Enterprise vascular reconstruction device versus the Pipeline embolization device (PED).
   METHODS: Six Yorkshire pigs underwent implantation of size-matched devices across the carotid bifurcation. Each animal received 1 Enterprise and 1 PED contralaterally. Baseline and 2-week follow-up angiography were performed. Images were analyzed including detailed measurements of the rete mirabile, a small-vessel conglomerate supplied by branches of the common carotid artery.
   RESULTS: In the absence of thromboembolic events at 2 weeks (n = 8), the perfused rete area measured 134.4 +/- 6.9 mm(2). In the presence of thromboembolic events (n = 4), the perfused rete was reduced to an area covering 37.1 +/- 8.6 mm(2) (P < 0.01). There was no difference in thrombogenicity between Enterprise and PED with a thromboembolic event rate of 33.3% for both devices (P > 0.99).
   CONCLUSION: The swine carotid stent model allows in vivo analysis of device-related thrombogenicity and distal embolic event rates. Size reduction of the perfused rete mirabile indicates the presence of thromboembolic events. Both Enterprise and PED were associated with similar thrombogenicity in this experiment.

TI Surgical Management of Brainstem Cavernous Malformation: Report of 67
   Patients
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Brainstem; Cavernous malformation; Surgical approach; Surgical technique
ID RESECTION; SERIES
AB BACKGROUND: Brainstem cavernous malformations (CMs) are benign lesions, often show an acute onset, and result in a high rate of morbidity. Surgical resection could inhibit the progressive deterioration of neurologic function caused by repetitive hemorrhage. This study aimed to summarize timing, approaches, and techniques of surgery and to evaluate outcomes of treatment.
   METHODS: Between March 2011 and May 2013, 67 patients (32 male, 35 female; average age 40 years; range, 14-68 years) with brainstem CMs received surgical treatment. Clinical presentation, surgical approaches, and results of follow-up were retrospectively analyzed.
   RESULTS: Seven surgical approaches were used: orbitozygomatic approach (1 case), suboccipital transtentorial approach (Poppen approach; 3 cases), subtemporal transtentorial approach (32 cases), subtemporal transtentorial/anterior petrosectomy approach (9 cases), suboccipital retrosigmoid approach (3 cases), midline suboccipital approach (16 cases), and far lateral approach (3 cases). Total resection of the brainstem CM was achieved in all cases (100%). No operative mortality was encountered. Nine patients had new symptoms after surgery: 3 had diplopia, 3 had facial numbness, 1 had numbness of contralateral limbs, 1 had transient aphasia, and 1 had reduced muscle strength of contralateral limbs. Symptoms significantly improved in 23 patients (34.3%), symptoms were unchanged in 36 patients (53.7%), and new postoperative symptoms occurred in 9 patients (13.4%).
   CONCLUSIONS: Choosing a proper surgical approach and using appropriate techniques are fundamental for favorable outcomes of patients with brainstem CMs.

AB OBJECTIVE: To describe neurosurgical patient and caregiver perceptions of provider communication, the impact of patient education, and their understanding of information given to them throughout the neurosurgical care trajectory.
   METHODS: We organized focus groups composed of patients who had been hospitalized on the neurosurgical service at 5 urban academic tertiary referral hospitals within a large university health system, along with the patients' caregivers. During focus groups, we used semistructured questions to answer the study questions. Content analysis was used to analyze the data.
   RESULTS: Forty-three patients and caregivers took part in 5 focus groups. In total we identified 12 coding categories (or topics) that were associated with patient and family information needs. Despite the fact all patients were receiving care within the same health system, often with the same care team and clinical environments, their experiences often could not have been more different. We found stark variations in how patients and caregivers described the quality of communication and patient education they received that affected their satisfaction. Satisfied patients and caregivers generally felt well informed and reported good understanding of the clinical care plan throughout the perioperative course, whereas dissatisfied patients struggled with unanswered questions, unmet information needs, and a sense of confusion throughout their care experience.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our study describes several unmet needs, finds inconsistencies in how information is delivered and a lack of patient-centered and caregiver-centered approaches to communication. Neurosurgery groups should identify unmet needs at their institution and implement strategies and interventions to improve the patient and caregiver experience.

AB BACKGROUND: A comparative evaluation of operative costs between single-level transforaminal interbody fusion (TLIF) and stand-alone lateral transpsoas interbody fusion (LIF) has not yet been done. We analyzed the costs, operative parameters, and early outcomes of single-level stand-alone LIF versus single-level TLIF.
   METHODS: Ten patients who underwent single-level TLIF and 10 patients who underwent single-level stand-alone LIF were included in the analysis. Total, variable, and fixed costs from perioperative data were available from a single institution. In addition, patient demographics, length of hospital stay, and 30-day outcomes and readmission rates were reviewed.
   RESULTS: Total cost, variable cost, and fixed costs were significantly lower in the LIF group, and there was no difference in outcomes.
   CONCLUSIONS: Single-level stand-alone LIF may prove to be more cost-effective and provide cost savings with analogous 30-day outcomes compared with single-level TLIF procedures.

AB OBJECTIVE: Pituitary macroadenomas extend into the extrasellar space, such as the sphenoid sinus, cavernous sinuses, and suprasellar region. However, factors that regulate the direction of their extensions into the surrounding anatomical structures remain unknown.
   METHODS: This retrospective study included 162 patients who were treated for pituitary adenomas that had maximum diameters greater than 20 mm. According to the direction of adenoma extension, patients were divided into 4 groups: group A, inferior into the sphenoid sinus; group B, lateral into the cavernous sinus; group C, suprasellar region with enlarged sella turcica; and group D, supraellar region without enlarged sella turcica. Several anatomical structures surrounding the sella turcica were evaluated statistically, and multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed if the structures met the determining factors of adenomas extensions.
   RESULTS: The maximum diameter of adenomas was significantly larger in groups A and D. The maximumdiameter of the diaphragmatic foramenwas largest in group C (19.3mm) and was significantly narrower in groups B (12.7 mm) and D (12.5 mm). Intrasphenoid septation, attached on the midline of the sella turcica, was observed most frequently in group D (78.6%) andwas not detectable in group A (0%). Extension into the cavernous sinus, classified as dural discontinuity, was highly prevalent in group B (80.0%) and was uncommon in group C (12.3%). Erosion of the posterior clinoid process was most apparent in group B (92.0%).
   CONCLUSIONS: The integrity of the sella dura and the intrasphenoid septation can regulate adenoma extension by encouraging their growth towards paths of least resistance.

AB OBJECTIVES: To assess the ability of multislice detector computed tomography (MDCT) to differentiate old versus acute/subacute vertebral fractures (VF) and to identify characteristic MDCT imaging signs.
   METHODS: 74 consecutive patients demonstrated 192 VF that were classified as either acute/subacute or old based on magnetic resonance imaging, MDCT, and clinical information as reference standard. Classification as acute/subacute versus old fractures based on MDCT alone was evaluated on a Likert scale by 2 independent radiologists. Morphologic MDCT features of fractures, such as trabecular compaction or fracture line, were recorded. Receiver operating characteristic analyses and Cohen's kappa were used to assess the discriminatory power of the MDCT and interrater agreement, respectively.
   RESULTS: Out of all 192 VF, 148 fractures were acute/subacute and 44 were old according to the reference standard. Receiver operating characteristic analyses of sole MDCT assessment showed very good identification of acute/subacute VF, with areas under the curve of 0.854 and 0.861 for readers 1 and 2, respectively. When indeterminate findings were treated as acute/subacute fractures, sensitivity and specificity were 97.2% and 58.1% for reader 1 and 94.5% and 65.1% for reader 2. Interrater agreement regarding fracture age was good (weighted Cohen's kappa = 0.607). Trabecular compression/callus distinct from the cortex (double compaction sign) was present in approximately half of acute/subacute VF and highly specific for acute/subacute VF (specificity = 93.2% and 88.6% for readers 1 and 2, respectively).
   CONCLUSION: The acuity of VF can be assessed by MDCT alone with high sensitivity and in case of a double compaction sign with high specificity.

AB BACKGROUND: Subaxial cervical spine injuries may be treated with either nonoperative stabilization or surgical fixation. The subaxial injury classification (SLIC) provides 1 method for suggesting the degree of necessity for surgery. In the current study, we examined if the SLIC score, or other preoperative metrics, can predict failure of nonoperative management.
   METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review to identify patients who presented with acute, nonpenetrating, subaxial cervical spine injury within our health system between 2007 and 2016. Patient demographics, medical comorbidities, injuries, and treatments were collected. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine potential predictors of failure of nonoperative management.
   RESULTS: During the study period, 40 patients met the inclusion criteria. A small subset of patients failed nonoperative management (n = 5, 12.5%). The mean SLIC score was 3.9 +/- 1.9; however, 14 (35%) patients had scores >4. Neither total SLIC score (P = 0.68) nor SLIC subscores (morphology [P = 0.96], discoligamentous complex [P = 0.83], neurologic status [P = 0.60]) predicted failure of nonoperative treatment. Time to evaluation/treatment did predict failure of nonoperative management. Evaluation within 8 hours of injury was a negative predictor of failure (odds ratio = 0.03, P = 0.001) and evaluation 24 hours or more after injury was a positive predictor of failure (odds ratio = 66.00, P < 0.001). We created a modified SLIC score on the basis of these findings, which significantly predicted failure of nonoperative management (P = 0.044).
   CONCLUSIONS: Management of subaxial spine injuries is complex. In our cohort, SLIC scoring did not adequately predict odds of failure of nonoperative management. Time to evaluation, however, did. We created a modified SLIC score that significantly predicted failure of nonoperative management.

AB OBJECTIVE: Although reports regarding the relationship between surgical complications and quality of life MOO exist, a general consensus regarding this issue is lacking. The aim of this study was to evaluate DOI after endoscopic transsphenoidal approach.
   METHODS: We assessed patients with sellar or parasellar lesions that were removed with endoscopic transsphenoidal approach or extended endoscopic transsphenoidal approach betvveen January 2010 and December 2016, 36-Item Short Form Health Survey and 30-Item General Health Questionnaire DOI scores were obtained preoperatively and 1 month and 6 months postoperatively.
   RESULTS: We analyzed 89 patients with malfunctioning pituitary adenoma (NFPA) and 39 patients with acromegaly. Physical DOI decreased 1 month after surgery but recovered after 6 months in both groups. Mental GU improved postoperatively compared with preoperatively, Patients with acrornegaly had a worse Physical Component Summary (PCS) on 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (48.7, 28.9, and 41.0) at 6 months than patients with NEPA. The low preoperative PCS group did not improve until 6 months postoperatively. Multiple regression analysis revealed the following factors were key to postoperative DOI: age (NEPA PCS 6 months postoperatively; correlation coefficient = 0,489), preoperative Mental Component Summary (MCS) (NEPA MCS 6 months postoperatively, correlation coefficient = 0.573), body mass index (acromegaly PCS 6 months postoperatively; correlation coefficient = 0.376), preoperative PCS (acrornegaly PCS 6 months postoperatively; correlation coefficient = 0.905), and preoperative MCS (acromegaly MCS 6 months postoperatively, correlation coefficient = 0.726).

AB BACKGROUND: Parasellar plasmacytomas are rare tumors arising from the sellar region that should be considered in the differential diagnosis of lesions involving the sella and clivus. Before surgical pathologic examination, parasellar plasmacytomas have often been misdiagnosed as invasive pituitary adenomas or chordomas owing to the similarity of the clinical presentation and imaging findings.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the data from 5 patients with parasellar plasmacytoma who underwent endonasal endoscopic tumor resection in Beijing Tiantan Hospital from January 2008 to January 2018. Their clinical symptoms, radiological features, and treatment modalities and outcomes were summarized.
   RESULTS: We enrolled a total of 5 patients (3 men and 2 women; median age at diagnosis, 54 years; range, 47-61) with parasellar plasmacytoma in the present clinical series. The presenting symptoms mainly included diplopia, headache, and blurred vision. All the patients had undergone endonasal endoscopic surgery combined with adjuvant therapy. After postoperative radiotherapy, complete remission was achieved within a median follow-up period of 41 months (range, 15-120).
   CONCLUSIONS: The differential diagnosis of parasellar plasmacytoma with pituitary adenoma and chordoma should include a thorough endocrine workup, neurological examination, and radiological assessment. Our findings support radiotherapy as the main treatment of choice for parasellar plasmacytoma, given its typical feature of relatively high radiosensitivity. Tumor resection through the endonasal endoscopic approach combined with adjuvant radiotherapy could be the optimal initial treatment strategy in long-term control of the lesion and alleviation of neurological symptoms.

AB BACKGROUND: Anterior lumbar approach, routinely used in spinal surgery, provides many advantages, specifically avoidance of manipulation and potential injury to nervous system structures; it also provides indirect central and foramina! decompression, with a complication rate of 1%-3%. Chyloretroperitoneum is a rare complication of spinal procedures using anterior lumbar approach. The aim of this study was to discuss diagnosis, treatment, and management of chyloretroperitoneum based on review of the international literature through 2017.
   METHODS: The literature review was conducted using the terms "chyloretroperitoneum," "spinal surgery," and "Iymphocele." Additionally, an illustrative case of chyloretroperitoneum following anterior retroperitoneal lumbar approach was presented,
   RESULTS: In 33 cases, including the present case, clinical symptoms appeared after discharge in 75.8% = 25) and reflected direct mass effect. Abdominopelvic computed tomography permitted assessment of the fluid collection observed as a hypodense collection around the psoas muscle. In 24 cases, drainage of the chyloretroperitoneum was maintained for a mean duration of 2.9 days. Surgery vitas performed in 14 patients (42.4%) owing to lymphatic collection. In 5 cases, surgery was performed for direct lymphatic vessel treatment. Laparoscopic marsupialization of the collection and peritoneal fenestration were performed, especially after percutaneous drainage failure,
   CONCLUSIONS: Computed tomography was the most useful imaging modality for diagnosis and assessment of associated complications. If puncture alone is not sufficient and should be avoided, percutaneous computed tomography guided drainage with sclerosing agent administration appears to be a safe and efficient first-line treatment. Laparoscopic fenestration should be used in cases of complicated or recurrent lymphoceles.

AB BACKGROUND: Surgery for lesions in eloquent brain areas remains challenging owing to the risk of permanent neurological deficits. To date, direct electrical stimulation (DES) and intraoperative neuromonitoring represent the reference standard. Recently, navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) has emerged as a mapping tool to optimize surgical planning. Our aim was to correlate nTMS with the intraoperative findings and assess its effects on surgical decision-making.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed our series of patients who had undergone craniotomy for removal of a brain tumor at our institution with preoperative nTMS, intraoperative neuromonitoring, and DES from February 2017 to February 2018. Demographic data, tumor entity and location, extent of resection, change in surgical approach, and neurological outcome were collected.
   RESULTS: Of 35 patients, 24 (68.6%) had undergone preoperative motor mapping and 11 (31.4%) had undergone mapping for language. Histopathological examination demonstrated glioma in 88.6% (high grade, n = 24; low grade, n = 6), metastasis (n = 2), epidermoid cyst (n = 1), and cavernoma (n = 1). nTMS resulted in change in the surgical strategy in 31.5% (craniotomy size, n = 7; access pathway, n = 3; surgical indication, n = 1). The specificity of nTMS for language was 66.7%, with a negative predictive value of 74.1%. nTMS motor mapping correlated with DES in all cases, with a mean abductor pollicis brevis hotspot distance of 3.50 +/- 0.66 mm (n = 9).
   CONCLUSIONS: nTMS is a safe, noninvasive adjunctive tool for preoperative mapping of brain tumors in eloquent areas. Furthermore, nTMS can influence the surgical decisions in up to one third of patients in our experience.

AB BACKGROUND: We compared the outcomes of endovascular embolization and surgery and investigated the factors affecting the clinical outcomes of spinal intradural dorsal arteriovenous fistulas (SIDAVFs).
   METHODS: The medical records of 26 patients who had undergone endovascular embolization or surgery for SIDAVFs from 2004 to 2014 were retrospectively reviewed. The recurrence rate and clinical outcomes for each treatment modality were compared. Multivariate analysis was used to identify significant factors influencing the clinical outcomes using the Aminoff and Logue (AL) score.
   RESULTS: Of the 26 patients, 14 (56%) had undergone endovascular embolization and 11 (44%) had undergone surgery as the initial treatment. Embolization was applied as the primary treatment for most patients. Surgery was chosen for patients with difficult superselection (n = 5), multiple feeders (n = 2), or easy surgical accessibility (n = 4). Of the 14 patients who had undergone embolization as initial treatment, 5 (36%) had developed a recurrence within an average of 29.6 months (range, 2-87). One patient with recurrent SIDAVF was treated with repeat embolization and four with surgery. None of patients in the surgical group developed recurrence. Embolization as the initial treatment resulted in significantly greater recurrence compared with surgery (odds ratio, 2.222; 95% confidence interval, 1.369-3.608; P = 0.046). Surgery resulted in better clinical outcomes than embolization (P = 0.021). The final AL score was also strongly affected by the preoperative AL score, micturition score, and recurrence (P = 0.000, P = 0.000, and P = 0.011, respectively).
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results have shown that surgery results in a low recurrence rate and superior clinical outcomes. A multidisciplinary and ordered decision is crucial for the treatment choice to ensure better outcomes, especially for patients with a definite neurologic deficit at diagnosis.

AB BACKGROUND: Spinal metastases (SMs) from kidney and thyroid cancers have several common features suggesting that excisional surgery for isolated and removable SMs can improve survival. We propose a simple treatment algorithm for SMs from these cancers. Our study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of the algorithm.
   METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of the data of 69 consecutive patients (48 with kidney and 21 with thyroid cancers) who underwent excisional surgery for SMs between 1995 and 2014. The patients were retrospectively classified into an indicated group for excisional SM surgery and a nonindicated group according to our algorithm, and the Tokuhashi and Tomita scoring systems. Patients in the indicated group were expected to survive >= 2 years postoperatively, whereas those in the nonindicated group were not. The positive predictive value and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated using the predicted versus actual survival times of the patients. Survival was defined as the time from the first excisional surgery for the spinal lesion to death or the last follow-up of >= 2 years.
   RESULTS: For patients with kidney cancer, the 2- and 5-year survival rates were 85.4% and 60.4%, respectively. For patients with thyroid cancer, the 2- and 5-year survival rates were 100% and 83.8%, respectively. Our algorithm had a compatible high positive predictive value (95.5%) and NPV (100%), whereas the Tokuhashi and Tomita scoring systems had low NPVs of 15.8% and 13.3%, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our treatment algorithm of SMs from kidney and thyroid cancers is useful for determining an adequate treatment including excisional surgery.

AB OBJECTIVE: Spontaneous cerebellar intracerebral hemorrhage (scICH) constitutes similar to 10% of all cases of spontaneous ICH, with a mortality of 20%-50%. Suboccipital craniectomy (SOC) is commonly performed for scICH causing brainstem compression or hydrocephalus. However, SOC requires long anesthesia times and results in a high complication rate. We present a series of patients who minimally invasive scICH evacuation as an alternative to traditional SOC.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the operative records for patients presenting to a single center from January 1, 2009 to March 1, 2017. All patients who had undergone evacuation of scICH were included in the present study. Clinical and radiographic variables were collected, including admission and postoperative Glasgow coma scale (GCS) scores, preoperative and postoperative hematoma volumes, and modified Rankin scale (mRS) scores at long-term follow-up.
   RESULTS: We identified 10 patients who had presented with scICH requiring surgery. All scICH evacuations were performed through a minicraniectomy positioned in the suboccipital area as close to the hematoma as possible. The mean patient age was 64.1 years. The mean presenting GCS score was 8.6, the mean initial hematoma volume was 25.4 mL, the mean procedure time was 57 minutes, and the mean postoperative hematoma volume was 2.8 mL. The mortality rate was 10% and mean long-term follow-up mRS score was 2.
   CONCLUSIONS: Minimally invasive scICH hematoma evacuation is a feasible alternative to SOC with numerous advantages that could lead to improved radiographic and clinical results.

AB OBJECTIVE: This study sought to determine whether a relationship exists between caudal instrumented level and revision rates, neck disability index scores, and cervical alignment in patients undergoing multilevel posterior cervical fusion.
   METHODS: This study examined a dataset of all patients undergoing posterior cervical decompression and fusion at >= 3 levels, terminating between C4 and T4, between January 2010 and December 2015, with at least 12 months of clinical follow-up. Patients were separated into cohorts based on caudal level of the fusion: C6 (or more cranial), C7, T1, or T2 (or more caudal). Revision rate, neck disability index score, sagittal vertical axis, T1 slope, and cervical lordosis were recorded. Linear regression and multivariate analysis were performed to identify independent predictors of patient outcomes and disparities between ending constructs in the cervical and the thoracic spine.
   RESULTS: The overall revision rate was 10.8% (n = 24). No statistically significant difference in the revision rate was identified between fusions terminating at C6 or cranial, C7, T1, or T2 and caudal (P = 0.74). Revision correlated strongly with increased sagittal vertical axis (P = 0.002) and T1 slope (P = 0.04). Increased neck disability index score correlated with revision rate (P = 0.01), cervical kyphosis (P < 0.001), and increased sagittal vertical axis (P = 0.04).
   CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that constructs terminating in the proximal thoracic spine have similar revision rates, postoperative neck disability index scores, and radiographic measurements as those terminating in the cervical spine. Poor cervical alignment, as evidenced by increased sagittal vertical axis, cervical kyphosis and T1 slope, predicts need for revision and of poorer clinical outcomes.

TI Malpractice Litigation in Brain Tumor Surgery: A 31-Year Analysis of
   Causative Factors in the United States from the Westlaw Database
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY

ID MEDICAL MALPRACTICE; RISK
AB BACKGROUND: Medical malpractice litigation is an issue of major concern in neurosurgery, with 19.1% of neurosurgeons facing a claim annually. Neurosurgery possesses the greatest risk of malpractice of any specialty, likely owing to the complex clinical environment and disease severity. In the present study, we have characterized such litigation to determine the common factors that compel plaintiffs to file these claims.
   METHODS: WestLawNext, a prominent legal database, was used to identify all cases from 1985 to 2016 related to brain tumors. A total of 225 cases were identified, and each was analyzed for the cause of litigation (multiple causes were permitted). Because many had >1 ground for litigation, the reported percentages were based on the total counts of litigation rather than the number of cases. Additional information was collected from each case, including location, tumor type, and physician specialty.
   RESULTS: The cases were distributed across 36 states and U.S. territories: California (n = 42; 20%) and New York (n = 28; 13%) had the greatest number of cases. The top reasons for litigation were failure to diagnose (n = 109; 28%), failure to treat (n = 72; 18%), procedural error (n = 63; 16%), and failure to refer for diagnostic tests (n = 55; 14%). The most common diagnoses included pituitary adenoma (n = 26; 12%), acoustic neuroma (n = 27; 12%), and meningioma (n = 23; 10%).
   CONCLUSIONS: Malpractice litigation contributes to high overhead and physician burnout and escalates the cost of patient care. We found that benign brain tumors were the most common in litigation and that surgical issues accounted for only a small percentage.

AB BACKGROUND: The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether quantitative radiomic profiles extracted from multiparametric magnetic resonance (MR) profiles can predict the clinical outcomes for patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM) before therapy.
   METHODS: MR images from 93 treatment-naive patients with newly diagnosed GBM were analyzed. Through tumor segmentation, we selected 36 radiomic features. Using the unsupervised clustering method, we classified our patients into 2 groups and investigated their overall survival (OS) using Kaplan-Meier analyses.
   RESULTS: Among the 36 radiomic features, the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) histogram parameters demonstrated a significant association with OS (P < 0.05). To validate this finding, unsupervised clustering analysis revealed 3 clusters with similar radiomic expression patterns. Clusters 1 and 2 showed a significant correlation with the radiomic features representing the tumor volume, and cluster 2 also showed a significant correlation with relative cerebral blood volume values. In contrast, cluster 3 showed an inverse relationship with cluster 2, mainly representing the radiomic features indicating the ADC and mean transit time. Although no statistically significant difference was found in OS between cluster 1 plus 2 and cluster 3, cluster 3 showed a trend toward longer OS compared with cluster 1 plus 2 (P = 0.067). After stratification by methylation status and radiomic feature clustering, patients with methylated O-6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase and those included in cluster 3 had significantly longer OS (P = 0.029).
   CONCLUSIONS: ADC histogram parameters are feasible prognostic biomarkers to predict the survival of patients with treatment-naive GBM. Quantitative MR profiles can predict the clinical outcomes of patients with GBM before therapy.

TI Intraoperative Ventriculostomy Using K Point in Surgical Management of
   Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Aneurysm; Subarachnoid hemorrhage; Ventriculostomy
AB BACKGROUND: Intraoperative ventriculostomy in the surgical management of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is frequently performed to reduce increased intracranial pressure. The previously suggested ventriculostomy points have some limitations because the dura mater must be opened to be accessed and it is difficult to measure the exact entry point in patients with brain edema. We propose a new intraoperative ventriculostomy point (K point) for use in the surgical management of aneurysmal SAH patient with severe brain edema.
   METHODS: We performed intraoperative ventriculostomy using the K point on 155 patients with aneurysmal SAH between January 2012 and August 2016. Before opening the dura mater following standard pterional craniotomy, we inserted the ventricular catheter through a small dural incision perpendicular to the middle frontal gyrus toward the ipsilateral medial epicanthus. We simulated the catheter trajectory using a commercial navigation system on 2 patients with brain tumor.
   RESULTS: Ventriculostomy related hemorrhage occurred in 12 patients (7.7%), but there were no large hemorrhages causing neurologic deterioration or requiring evacuation. No language impairment was observed in these patients. Analysis using the navigation system revealed that the trajectory of K point ventriculostomy avoided critical periventricular brain structures and passed through the space between the genu of the corpus callosum and head of the caudate nucleus.
   CONCLUSIONS: K point ventriculostomy allows for easy access to a target point and protects the brain during opening of the dura mater and drilling of the sphenoid bone.

   Nucleus

LA English
DT Article
DE Anatomy; Cognition; Deep nucleus; Diffusion image; fMRI
ID COGNITIVE FUNCTION
AB BACKGROUND: The human cerebellum plays an important role in motor and nonmotor coordination. Any functional loss of the dentate nucleus can result in interruption of the cerebellar efferent pathway based on its somatotopy. However, understanding of the vascular supply to the dentate nucleus remains inadequate.
   METHODS: The origin of the perforators to the dentate nucleus was investigated by microscopic anatomic dissection of 14 human cerebellar hemispheres. The dentate nuclei were divided dorsoventrally, rostrocaudally, and mediolaterally to identify which cerebellar artery dominated which part of the dentate nucleus.
   RESULTS: The average number of perforators from the superior cerebellar artery (SCA) to the dentate nucleus was 2.2 +/- 0.9. The average number of perforators from the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) was 1.8 +/- 0.7. The anterior inferior cerebellar artery did not provide perforators to the dentate nucleus. The dorsal, rostral, and lateral halves of the dentate nucleus were more frequently dominated by the SCA than by the PICA. The ventral and medial halves of the dentate nucleus were more frequently dominated by the PICA than by the SCA. The dorsal rostrolateral and the ventral caudomedial sections were mainly supplied by the SCA and PICA, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: These findings in combination with findings of previous imaging studies suggest that the SCA is mainly associated with the motor activity and the PICA is mainly associated with the nonmotor activity of the dentate nucleus.

AB OBJECTIVE: In presurgical planning for intracranial meningiomas, the relationship between tumors and adjacent vasculature must be identified. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of 3-dimensional digital subtraction angiography (3D-DSA) with dual-volume visualization (DVV).
   METHODS: Between February 2013 and April 2016, 26 patients with intracranial meningiomas enrolled in this study. Two or 3 days before surgery, 3D-DSA with DVV was performed for presurgical planning. If necessary, the tumor was simultaneously embolized.
   RESULTS: Vascular supply and disfiguration observed by preoperative 3D-DSA with DVV closely resembled those actually observed during surgery. All but 2 patients had total tumor resection (Simpson grade 1 or 2). Three of 26 patients had new neurologic deficits.
   CONCLUSIONS: 3D-DSA with DVV may be useful for preoperative planning by allowing the surgeon to identify the relationship between a tumor and peritumoral vasculature before meningioma surgery. Young neurosurgeons with little experience may benefit most from this technique.

AB OBJECTIVE: Cerebral aneurysm growth often precedes rupture. Definite contributors to aneurysm growth have not been determined even by means of recently developed commercially available computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software. We developed an original CFD tool that can analyze data from time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography (TOF-MRA) before growth in the growing aneurysms and investigate possible factors for aneurysm growth in the near future.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed unruptured aneurysms that were treated at our institute because of aneurysm growth (growing group) between April 2013 and March 2017. Stable aneurysms that had demonstrated no growth for more than 5 years were selected (stable group). TOF-MRA data of these aneurysms were retrospectively converted to 3-dimensional vessel geometric data; 3 hemodynamic indices including streamline, wall shear stress (WSS), and oscillatory shear index were calculated by our original CFD tool using the lattice Boltzmann method to quantitatively compare the 2 groups.
   RESULTS: Six growing aneurysms and 6 stable aneurysms were analyzed. Of the 6 growing aneurysms, WSS on the focal aneurysmal sac increased temporally in the vicinity of the constant low WSS area at the peak systolic phase. By contrast, WSS did not increase during any part of the cardiac cycle in 3 of the 6 stable aneurysms. The peak values of WSS were significantly different between the 2 groups.
   CONCLUSIONS: A focal increase in WSS in the peak systolic phase may be a risk factor for aneurysm enlargement in the near future.

AB OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of basal membranotomy performed to ensure cerebral expansion in patients operated for chronic subdural hematoma.
   METHODS: Patients who were operated for unilateral chronic subdural hematoma and underwent basal membranotomy in addition to hematoma drainage were included in the first phase of the study. After the superficial membranous structures were excised, the maximum perpendicular distance between the internal tabula and the cerebral surface was measured after subdural hematoma evacuation. Subsequently, basal membranotomy was performed, the maximum perpendicular distance between the internal tabula and the cerebral surface was measured again, and the improvement in cerebral expansion was statistically calculated. The improvement of cerebral expansion in the patients who had undergone double burr hole drainage was statistically calculated in the second stage of the study.
   RESULTS: The cerebral expansion after the basal membrane excision was 41.1% in those with a 1.5- to 2-cm hematoma, 43.1% in those with a 2.1- to 3-cm hematoma, 43.5% in those with a 3.1- to 4-cm hematoma, and 45.4% in those with a hematoma thicker than 4 cm on average. No recurrence was seen during the 6-month follow-up in any patient. Double burr hole drainage revealed similar values for cerebral expansion increase with a mean value of 10%. The burr hole drainage was repeated because of recurrence in 5 patients during the 2-month follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: The mini craniotomy-basal membranotomy technique provided statistically significantly better cerebral expansion in patients with chronic subdural hematoma when compared with the double burr hole drainage technique.

ID DEGENERATIVE LUMBAR SPONDYLOLISTHESIS; SAGITTAL ALIGNMENT; PELVIC
   INCIDENCE; SPINAL STENOSIS; FUSION; DECOMPRESSION
AB OBJECTIVE:Lumbar spondylolisthesis can be related to facet arthropathy and disc degeneration or to a fracture of the pars interarticularis, but the mechanistic underpinnings of spondylolisthesis remain unclear. We posit that high sacral slope and body weight increase sacral inclination vector forces, which leads to pars fractures and exacerbates risk for spondylolisthesis.
   METHODS:To investigate this hypothesis, we measured the sacral slope, body weight, and S1 endplate vector forces for patients who underwent L5-S1 fusion for grade I spondylolisthesis. Patients were stratified based on presence of pars fractures versus facet arthropathy, and statistical analyses were performed to determine whether high sacral endplate inclination vector force is associated with pars fracture-mediated spondylolisthesis.
   RESULTS:We identified 131 patients who had L5-S1 fusion for spondylolisthesis. The mean age was 56 years, and 57% were female. The body weight of patients ranged from 45.4 to 141.9 kg with an average of 83.8 kg; 32 patients had single-level L5-S1 spondylolisthesis secondary to bilateral L5 pars interarticularis fractures, whereas 99 patients had L5-S1 spondylolisthesis due to facet arthropathy. Patients with pars fractures had steeper sacral slopes (43.2 +/- 10.1 degrees) compared with those without pars fractures (36.8 +/- 8.1 degrees) (P = 0.0007, odds ratio 2.71). Despite having no significant differences in weight (82.7 +/- 17.2 vs. 87.3 +/- 17.2 kg, P = 0.189), patients with pars fractures had 49% greater sacral inclination vector forces compared with those without pars fractures (586 +/- 158 N vs. 394 +/- 90 N, P < 0.0001).
   CONCLUSIONS:These data suggest that high sacral endplate inclination vector force is a risk factor for developing pars fracture-mediated spondylolisthesis.

AB OBJECTIVE: Little is known about the long-term efficacy, prognostic factors, and tolerability of gamma knife radiosurgery (GKS) for acromegaly. The aim of this study was to investigate long-term hormonal effects, prognostic factors, and tolerability of GKS in patients with growth hormone-secreting adenoma.
   METHODS: A retrospective multicenter study over 25 years with a median follow-up of 85.2 months was performed. A total of 138 patients from 3 tertiary referral centers in South Korea were included in this study between 1991 and 2017. Main outcome measures were endocrine remission, endocrine control under somatostatin analogues, and hypopituitarism.
   RESULTS: With a mean follow-up period of 85.2 months (range, 12-304 months), overall median time to the endocrine remission and control under long-acting somatostatin analogues was 138 months and 96 months, respectively. Female sex, normal age-adjusted insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1) <= 2, and GKS as an adjuvant treatment were significantly favorable factors for remission (P = 0.004, P = 0.001, P = 0.010, respectively). The early response group had a significantly lower proportion of normal age-adjusted IGF-1 levels >2 than did the late response group (22.2% vs. 51.7%, P = 0.035); also, the early response group had lower radiation dose than the late response group (24.3 Gy vs. 27.0 Gy, P = 0.003). The incidence of GKS-induced hypopituitarism (1 or more) was 12 of 138 patients (8.6%) at the last follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: In acromegalic patients, women with normal age-adjusted IGF-1 <= 2 and GKS as an adjuvant treatment have a better response to GKS. We should take into account the variability of radiosensitivity of the tumor according to the gender and IGF-1 level.

ID WALL SHEAR-STRESS; RISK-FACTORS; FLOW
AB BACKGROUND: Many researchers have found a correlation between tortuous arteries and development of aneurysms in cerebral arteries. However, there are no studies analyzing the impact of tortuosity on risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) occurrence. Therefore, we decided to determine whether tortuosity of the anterior cerebral artery can be related to the rupture of anterior communicating artery aneurysm and to severity and treatment outcome of SAH.
   METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed anterior cerebral artery anatomy of 121 patients with anterior communicating artery aneurysms. From patients' medical records, we obtained their history including previous and current diseases and medications. For each patient we calculated relative length, sum of angle metrics, triangular index, product of angle distance, and inflection count metrics.
   RESULTS: Patients with SAH had significantly higher relative length (0.70 +/- 0.19 vs. 0.63 +/- 0.22; P = 0.03) and significantly lower inflection count metrics (0.10 +/- 0.08 vs. 0.16 +/- 0.19; P < 0.01), respectively. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, after adjustment of all possible confounders, diabetes mellitus (odds ratio [OR], 0.154; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.032-0.553; P < 0.01) and higher inflection count metrics (OR, 0.604; 95% CI, 0.357-0.909; P = 0.042) remained independently associated with lower risk of SAH. We also found an independent correlation between aneurysm dome size (R = -0.289; P = 0.02) and triangular index (R = 0.273; P = 0.03) and Glasgow Coma Scale score on admission.
   CONCLUSIONS: Higher anterior cerebral artery tortuosity might be a protective factor against anterior communicating artery aneurysm rupture.

AB OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between noninfectious fever onset and radiographic vasospasm, delayed ischemic neurologic deficit (DIND), delayed cerebral infarction (DCI), and clinical outcome in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
   METHODS: We evaluated 44 patients for the association between noninfectious fever (greater than 101.5 degrees F) and the development of radiographic vasospasm by digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and transcranial Doppler (TCD), DIND, DCI, and modified Rankin scale outcome score at 6 months to 2 years. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to account for patient age, sex, admission Hunt and Hess grade, and Fisher grade. TCD was additionally used for temporal analysis.
   RESULTS: Noninfectious fever was significantly associated with radiographic vasospasm using both DSA (odds ratio [OR], 2.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-4.5; P = 0.02) and TCD (OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.2-5.6; P = 0.02), but it was not associated with DIND, DCI, or outcome. The maximum cross correlation between TCD velocity and temperature occurred for temperatures taken 1 day prior to TCD velocity measurement. A quadratic mixed-effects model demonstrated that TCD velocity was significantly associated with temperature from 1 day prior to TCD velocity measurement (beta = 13.5; 95% CI, 0.83-8.79, P = 0.01), posthemorrhage day (beta = 20.1; 95% CI, 2.14-7.52; P < 0.001), and (posthemorrhage day)(2) (beta = -0.72; 95% CI, -0.26 to -0.11; P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: Noninfectious fever was associated with the development of radiographic vasospasm but not with DIND, DCI, or clinical outcome. Furthermore, there is a temporal association between the onset of noninfectious fever and radiographic vasospasm by 1 day. Fever independent of patient's infectious profile may be an early marker for the development of radiographic vasospasm.

DT Article
DE Cerebrospinal fluid; Cyst; Hydrocephalus; Neuroenteric; Spinal cord
ID ARACHNOID CYSTS; DIAGNOSIS
AB OBJECTIVE: Surgical treatment of ventrally located intradural cysts is difficult and controversial. Laminectomy with division of the denticulate ligaments and gentle cord mobilization remains the standard approach but risks further neurologic deterioration secondary to cord manipulation. Our purpose is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a midline cord-splitting approach as an alternative for treating ventral thoracic intradural cysts.
   METHODS: We describe 2 patients who were treated for ventral intradural cysts causing progressive and severe myelopathy. Under general anesthesia and continuous neurophysiologic monitoring, laminectomy, durotomy, and cord splitting through a midline approach gave direct access to both lesions. Cyst drainage was supplemented by a cystopleural shunt in 1 case.
   RESULTS: Cyst collapse and cord reexpansion were documented in both patients with a magnetic resonance imaging scan 1 week after surgery. In both cases there was a significant neurologic improvement, which was maintained 2 years postoperatively. Intraoperative monitoring recorded no loss of somatosensory or motor potentials during surgery. Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging scans 2 years postoperatively showed no evidence of cyst recurrence, and both patients remained neurologically improved and stable.
   CONCLUSIONS: We have been able to drain 2 ventral intradural cysts using a cord-splitting technique. This has allowed safe access to purely ventrally located lesions, which were inaccessible dorsally or dorsolaterally. By using this method we have been able to avoid a more invasive ventral transthoracic approach necessitating vertebrectomy and reconstruction and risking serious complications.

AB BACKGROUND: Brain metastases commonly manifest in patients with cancer, with similar to 20%-50% presenting with 1 intracranial lesion. Among patients with 1, small brain metastasis and controlled or absent extracranial disease, it remains unclear whether aggressive intracranial management using neurosurgical resection plus cavity stereotactic radiosurgery/stereotactic radiotherapy (SRS/SRT) rather than SRS/SRT alone is beneficial. In patients with controlled or absent extracranial disease and 1 brain metastasis <= 2 cm in size, we evaluated the effect of surgery plus SRS/SRT compared with SRS/SRT on oncologic outcomes, including overall survival.
   METHODS: We retrospectively identified 86 patients with controlled or absent extracranial disease and 1 brain metastasis <= 2 cm in size who had been treated from 2000 to 2015 at our institution. We examined differences in the rates of local and distant failure, use of salvage treatment, and other oncologic outcomes, including all-cause mortality.
   RESULTS: The baseline characteristics were similar between the 2 cohorts. The median follow-up period for the surviving patients was 38 months. On multivariable analysis, surgical resection plus cavity SRS/SRT was associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 0.44; 95% confidence interval, 0.19-1.00; P = 0.05) compared with SRS/SRT alone. The 1- and 2-year rates of overall survival were 100% and 88% versus 74% and 52% for surgery plus cavity SRS/SRT versus SRS/SRT alone, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: Aggressive, local therapy, including neurosurgical resection, might benefit patients with 1 brain metastasis in the context of controlled or absent systemic disease, even if the lesion in question is small. Further studies are needed to evaluate these associations.

TI Relationship Between TI Slope Minus C2-7 Lordosis and Cervical Alignment
   Parameters After Adjacent 2-Level Anterior Cervical Diskectomy and

SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
ID SAGITTAL BALANCE; T1 SLOPE; SURGERY
AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationships between sagittal alignment parameters and Neck Disability Index (NDI) scores after adjacent 2-level anterior cervical diskectomy and fusion (ACDF) and to study the impact of the T1 slope (T1s) minus C2-7 lordosis (T1s-CL).
   METHODS: In total, 76 patients after adjacent 2-level ACDF were retrospectively analyzed. Radiographic measurements included Tis, C2-7 lordosis, Tls-CL, segment angle (SA), and C2-7 sagittal vertical axis (SVA). NDI scores were used to evaluate clinical prognosis. Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated between radio-graphic measures. Linear regression analysis was used to analyze the relationships between follow-up cervical sagittal parameters and NM.
   RESULTS: Delta T1s was positively correlated with Delta C2-7 lordosis (r = 0.466, P< 0.001), Delta T1s-CL (r = 0.337, P = 0.003), Delta C2-7 SVA (r = 0238, P< 0.05), and Delta SA (r = 0.654, P< 0.001). Delta C2-7 lordosis was positively correlated with Delta SA (r P< 0.001) and negatively correlated with 1T1s-CL (r= -0.676, P< 0.001) and Delta C2-7 SVA (r = -0.418, P< 0.001). Delta T1s-CL was positively correlated with Delta C2-7 SVA (r = 0.644, P < 0.001). The pre- and postoperative SAs were significantly different (P< 0.05), increasing from 3.71 degrees +/- 8.92 degrees to 9.63 +/- 420 degrees Preoperative NM was positively correlated with preoperative C2-7 SVA (r = 0.325, P = 0.004) and Tls-CL (r = 0.498, P< 0.001). Follow-up NDI was positively correlated with follow-up T1s)r = 0.359, P = 0.001), C2-7 SVA (r = 0.613, P < 0.001), and Tls-CL (r = 0.696, P < 0.001) and negatively correlated with C2-7 lordosis (r = 0.491, P < 0.001). The linear regression model showed that when preoperative IlsCL was greater than 21.43 the NDI score was greater than 25/4 = 0248, P < 0.001), and when follow-up Tls-CL was greater than 28.07 the NW score was greater than 25 (R-2 = 0.484, P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: Changes in cervical sagittal parameters after 2-level ACDF were associated with quality of life. A greater T1S-CL mismatch was related to a greater degree of cervical malalignment. Tls-CL may be a more important predictor of cervical malalignment than C2-7 SVA. Specifically, a mismatch greater than 28.07 corresponded to positive cervical sagittal malalignment, defined as an NDI score greater than 25.

AB BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to evaluate the physiologic change of cervical spine (CS) alignment between 2 radiographs (whole spine [WS] and CS).
   METHODS: Multilevel cervical segmental angles (horizontal gaze, C2 slope, C7 slope, and T1 slope) were measured, and C0-2 angle, C0-7 angle, and C2-7 angle were also calculated.The relative translation statuses of C2-7 sagittal vertical axis and C0-7 sagittal vertical axis were measured,
   RESULTS: Generally, statistically significant differences were found for occipitalslope (Delta 7.1 degrees) and C7 slope (Delta 2,1 degrees), and these results induced a significant C0-2 angle (Delta 4.6 degrees) and nonsignificant C2-7 angle (Delta 1.2 degrees) change between the 2 types of radiographs. In the fixed horizontal gaze group analysis, C7 slope and C2-7 angle were significantly different between WS and CS radiographs. In the nonfixed horizontal gaze group analysis, C7 slope exhibited significant upward movement (Delta 3.7), and C7 slope did not showed significant change (Delta 0.1 degrees), which caused the constant value of cervical lordosis (C2-7 angle) between the 2 radiographs (P = 0.084),
   CONCLUSIONS: Horizontal gaze fixation may induce untruthful results of cervical lordosis (C2-7 angle) and a nonphysiologic distribution ratio of cervical lordosis (C0-2 angle, 92% vs. C2-7 angle, 8%), However, if the horizontal gaze is not controlled, WS radiographs exhibit a constant value of the C7 slope compared with CS radiographs, which may induce the unchanged state of cervical lordosis and physiologic distribution ratio of cervical lordosis (C0-2 angle, 74% vs. C2-7 angle, 26%).

AB BACKGROUND: Based on our experience with the endoscopic endonasal approach (EEA) and transorbital approach (TOA) for middle cranial fossa tumors, we evaluated the efficacy and limitations of visualization and the clinical outcomes associated with the approaches depending on the surgical corridors. In addition, we determined the optimal strategy for each approach.
   METHODS: Between September 2015 and May 2018, we retrospectively reviewed clinical outcomes in 21 patients who underwent minimally invasive endoscopic surgery for middle cranial fossa tumors involving the cavernous sinus. We classified the endoscopic approaches into 4 groups: endonasal quadrangular transcavernous (type I), endonasal infratemporal (type II), transclival medial-to-lateral (type III), and transorbital (type IV) routes. Displacement of the internal carotid artery, extent of tumor involvement, and the surgical corridor to the tumor direction were the primary determinants of the approach.
   RESULTS: The study enrolled 21 patients. Based on the classification of approaches, 6 patients underwent surgery via type I, 5 via type II, 1 via type III, 7 via type IV, and 2 via a combined approach. Among the 21 patients, gross total resection was performed in 12 (57.1%), subtotal resection in 6, and partial resection in 3. Comparison of the type I (EEA) with the type 4 (TOA) route showed that the gross total resection rate with the EEA was 33.3% compared with 71.4% with the TOA (P = 0.286).
   CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic surgery can be considered an alternative with acceptable sequelae and reduced morbidity for the management of middle cranial fossa tumors. Surgeons should be aware of the strengths and weaknesses of each surgical corridor and select the optimal approach for each patient based on the tumor.

AB BACKGROUND: A few reported studies have documented psychotic syndromes secondary to a middle fossa arachnoid cyst (AC). However, the association between middle fossa ACs and psychopathological symptoms remains to be determined. The present study investigated the psychopathological effects of middle fossa ACs in young men.
   METHODS: We reviewed military personal inventory test profiles and baseline demographic data of 19-year-old conscription examinees from February 2013 to December 2016. In total, 132 examinees with middle fossa ACs and 350 examinees with normal findings were enrolled in the present study. Two separate comparisons were performed. First, we compared the middle fossa AC group with the control group. Second, the middle fossa AC group was divided into 2 groups according to cyst size and compared with the control group.
   RESULTS: Faking bad response behavior, infrequency, inconsistency, depression, schizophrenia, paranoia, and personality disorder cluster A scales were significantly associated with the presence of a middle fossa AC. Abnormal responses to the military personal inventory were significantly and positively correlated with cyst size. The prediction rate to show abnormal psychological results with the presence of an AC was estimated to be 60.7%-68.8%.
   CONCLUSIONS: The presence of ACs and cyst size were associated with psychopathology in this select group of young men. The size-dependent psychopathological effects of ACs appear to result from a local mass effect on the brain.

AB OBJECTIVE: Because of the paucity of relevant data, treatment and outcomes in intracranial atypical meningioma (AM) remain unclear. The aim of this study was to find useful factors predicting survival and to evaluate the role of postoperative radiation after surgery.
   METHODS: Data were obtained from 302 patients with AM who underwent surgery between January 2008 and December 2015.
   RESULTS: A series of 302 patients, including 166 female and 136 male, underwent surgery at our institution. Gross total resection (GTR) was achieved in 201 (66.6%) patients. Seventy-five patients (24.8%) underwent postoperative radiation after surgery. For the entire cohort, there were 131 (43.4%) recurrences, 1 (0.33%) metastasis, and 56 (18.5%) mortalities during a median follow-up duration of 41.6 months. The median recurrence-free survival (RFS) was 55.2 months after the date of the first AM surgery, with 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year RFS rates of 87.6%, 63.3% and 47.7%, respectively. The median overall survival (OS) for patients was 99.8 months, and the actuarial OS rates from the time of the first AM surgery at 1, 3, and 5 years were 97.0%, 90.6%, and 78.8%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, preoperative Karnofsky Performance Scale score (>= 80), primary tumor, tumor invasiveness, and GTR were associated with increased RFS, whereas preoperative Karnofsky Performance Scale score (>= 80), primary tumor, supratentorial location, lack of peritumoral edema, radiotherapy, and GTR were associated with increased OS.
   CONCLUSIONS: GTR is the first choice for patients with AM. We recommend that patients with secondary tumors receive radiotherapy after surgery.

AB BACKGROUND: The effects of oblique lateral interbody fusion (OLIF) and minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (MI-TLIF) have not been compared by a meta-analysis. The present study aimed to summarize the radiographic and clinical outcomes of OLIF and MI-TLIF for degenerative lumbar disease.
   METHODS: We performed a systematic review of related studies and report the outcomes of OLIF and MI-TLIF for degenerative lumbar disease. The radiographic outcomes measures included disc height, segmental lordotic angle, lumbar lordotic angle, and fusion. The clinical and functional outcomes included operative blood loss, operative time, length of hospital stay, complications, visual analog scale, and Oswestry disability index. Data pooling and meta-analysis with the random effects model were performed to evaluate the results.
   RESULTS: A total of 47 studies met the inclusion criteria. Similar changes in terms of disc height, segmental lordotic angle, lumbar lordotic angle, length of hospital stay, visual analog scale, Oswestry disability index, and radiological evidence of fusion of >90% were observed between the 2 groups. The OLIF group showed less operative blood loss and operative time. The incidence of intraoperative and postoperative complications was 9.5% and 19.9% for the OLIF group and 3.5% and 8.5% for the MI-TLIF group, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: The radiographic and functional outcomes and length of hospital stay were similar between the 2 groups. The OLIF group showed advantages in operative blood loss and operative time; however, the incidence of complications in this technique was greater than that in the MI-TLIF group.

AB BACKGROUND: We compared the clinical and radiographic outcomes of corrective surgery in patients with poliomyelitis-related spinal deformity (PSD) using 3 types of pelvic fixation and investigated the incidence and risk factors for complications.
   METHODS: We reviewed the data from 42 patients with PSD who had undergone spinopelvic reconstruction at a single institution from 2000 to 2016. Of the 42 patients, 15 had been treated with the Galveston technique, 13 with iliac screw fixation, and 14 with S2-alar-iliac (S2AI) screw fixation. Demographic data, radiographic parameters, and complications were analyzed. Health-related quality of life was determined using Scoliosis Research Society (SRS) 22-item questionnaires and the Oswestry Disability Index scores.
   RESULTS: After surgery, the correction rate of the main curve was 51.7%, 57.8%, and 52.1% in the 3 groups, with significant improvement in regional kyphosis, coronal balance, and pelvic obliquity (PO) (P < 0.05). The correction of PO was similar among the 3 types of pelvic fixation; however, the patients treated with S2AI fixation required significantly less operative time (P < 0.05) and blood loss (P < 0.006). The overall complication rate was 40.5%, with a major complication rate of 23.8%. Age at surgery (P = 0.006) and grade > 2 SRS-Schwab osteotomy (P = 0.036) were significant risk factors for complications. Significant improvement was found in the SRS-22 and Oswestry Disability Index scores at the final follow-up examination in the 3 groups.
   CONCLUSIONS: The present study showed satisfactory correction of spinopelvic deformity for 42 patients with PSD. Compared with the Galveston technique and iliac screw fixation, the use of S2AI significantly decrease the operative time and estimated blood loss and obtained similar correction of PO. Patient age at surgery and grade > 2 SRS-Schwab osteotomy were significant risk factors for complications.

ID MR-IMAGING FINDINGS; PROGNOSTIC-FACTORS; FEATURES; VARIANT;
   CLASSIFICATION; RESECTION; TUMORS; CT
AB BACKGROUND: Clear cell meningioma (CCM) is a rare histologic subtype of meningioma. The features of CCMs have commonly been based on intracranial cases. However, CCMs in the spinal cord are even rarer, and their natural history, management, and prognosis remain ill-defined.
   METHODS: From January 2006 to January 2018, 12 patients with spinal CCM were treated in our hospital. The clinical features, radiologic findings, diagnosis, treatment, and outcome of these patients were analyzed retrospectively. Additionally, we performed a review of the reported data on spinal CCMs.
   RESULTS: CCMs accounted for 2.8% of all the spinal meningiomas treated in our hospital. The most common localization of this disease was the lumbar region (7 of 12). The mean age at diagnosis was significantly younger than that of patients with spinal meningiomas (28.8 +/- 13.4 years vs. 54.0 +/- 14.4 years). During the follow-up period, 5 patients (41.7%) experienced tumor recurrence. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that younger patients had a significantly shorter progression-free survival time than older patients. The review of the reported data showed that 55 cases of spinal CCMs had been reported. Nineteen patients (38.0%) had developed local recurrence, with a 5-year progression-free survival rate of 33.3%.
   CONCLUSIONS: Spinal CCMs are extremely rare tumors with a predilection to affect younger patients and have a high recurrence rate. Although gross total resection is considered to be the optimal treatment, radiotherapy could be considered for patients who had undergone subtotal resection or for younger patients, regardless of the extent of removal. Close follow-up of the entire neuraxis for years is crucial.

AB BACKGROUND: Internal carotid artery occlusion (ICAO) causes transient ischemic attack and cerebral infarction. ICAO management remains clinically challenging. We discuss a hybrid treatment combining carotid endarterectomy and endovascular intervention (E-I) for patients with nontaper or nonstump lesions of symptomatic ICAO.
   METHODS: We treated 32 patients with consecutive nontaper or nonstump ICAO with neurological symptoms with hybrid treatment or E-I. We analyzed the epidemiology, symptoms, angiographic morphology, technical success rate, and perioperative complications.
   RESULTS: Of the 32 patients, 17 were treated with hybrid surgery and 15, E-I. The demographic data and lesion characteristics were similar between the 2 groups. The overall recanalization success rate was 71.9%. The rate for hybrid surgery was better than that for E-I (88.2% vs. 53.3%). The postoperative cerebral hyperperfusion rate showed no difference between the 2 groups (11.8% vs. 6.7%). Ipsilateral cerebral perfusion improved after treatment. The mean transition time and time to peak were greater than normal (normal values, <6 seconds and <8 seconds, respectively). Both increased significantly after treatment (mean transition time, 11.30 seconds vs. 7.25 seconds; time to peak, 19.30 seconds vs. 15.50 seconds). The incidence of perioperative complications from hybrid surgery was less than that with E-I (5.9% vs. 40.0%). Recurrent cerebrovascular events (5.9% vs. 13.3%) and the 3-month modified Rankin scale score (2.76 +/- 0.66 vs. 2.93 +/- 0.70) did not differ between the 2 groups.
   CONCLUSIONS: Recanalization of nontaper or nonstump ICAO with hybrid treatment was more successful than that with E-I, with fewer perioperative complications. The carotid endarterectomy procedure enables easier wire crossing across the occlusion and reduces potential technology-related complications by requiring a shorter lesion and fewer dissections and minimizing the effect of calcification.

AB OBJECTIVE: Spinal arteriovenous malformations (SAVMs) and intramedullary spinal cord cavernous malformations (ISCCMs) have a very low incidence of disease. The purpose of this study was to compare the differences in electrophysiologic monitoring in these 2 surgeries.
   METHODS: The study included 109 patients (SAVMs, n = 55; ISCCMs, n = 54) recruited from November 2012 to January 2016. All patients underwent electrophysiologic monitoring during the entire operation, including somato-sensory-evoked potentials, motor-evoked potentials, and electromyography. We used an amplitude reduction of >80% as warning criterion for motor-evoked potentials and an amplitude reduction of more than 50% and latency prolongation of more than 10% as warning criteria for somatosensory-evoked potentials.
   RESULTS: In our study, the sensitivity and specificity of intraoperative monitoring during SAVM surgery were 77.3% and 87.1%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of intraoperative monitoring during ISCCM surgery were 68.8% and 83.3%, respectively. We found that 21 patients with SAVM showed permanent changes, 17 had immediate postoperative impairment, 8 recovered before discharge, and 5 showed neurologic deficits at long-term follow-up. Of the 17 patients with ISCCMs showing permanent changes, 11 had immediate postoperative impairment, 5 recovered before discharge, and 2 had long-term residual neurologic deficits.
   CONCLUSIONS: Electrophysiological monitoring provides effective guidance during operation on spinal vascular malformations. Electrophysiologic monitoring revealed that surgical resection of SAVMs resulted in more permanent changes and postoperative dysfunction when compared with ISCCMs. The incidence of both false-positive and -negative results suggests that electrophysiologic monitoring cannot fully predict the complete function of the patients.

AB OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to analyze the outcomes of cavernous sinus hemangiomas (CSHs) treated surgically, and to investigate factors that affect the gross total resection (GTR), newly developed or deteriorated cranial nerve injury (NDDCNI), and follow-up neurologic performance, and to further discuss the optimal treatment for CSHs.
   METHODS: Clinical data of 47 patients with CSHs treated surgically at our institution between 2012-2018 were retrospectively reviewed.
   RESULTS: GTR was achieved in 26 (55.3%) patients. Significant relations were identified between the invasion of the sella turcica (odds ratio [OR] = 0.012; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.001-0.213; P = 0.002), skull base ward (OR [27.838; 95% CI, 2.995-258.748; P = 0.003), and GTR. The preoperative Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) score (OR = 2.966, per 10 score increase; 95% CI, 1.136-7.743; P = 0.026) and the invasion of the sella turcica (OR = 7.137; 95% CI, 1.282-39.726; P = 0.025) were factors that significantly affected the incidence of NDDCNI. The average follow-up KPS score, which increased significantly compared with the pre (P < 0.001) and postoperative KPS scores (P < 0.001), was 89.1. Increased tumor size (OR = 0.044, per 1cm increase; 95% CI, 0.004-0.477; P = 0.010) was a risk factor for unfavorable follow-up KPS score.
   CONCLUSIONS: Being treated by an experienced skull base surgeon favors the total removal of CSHs, whereas the invasion of the sella turcica does just the opposite. Increased tumor size is a risk factor for unfavorable followup KPS score. The invasion of the sella turcica was related to NDDCNI and unfavorable follow-up KPS score.

AB BACKGROUND: The reconstruction of complex cranial defects is challenging and is associated with a high complication rate. The development of a patient-specific, titanium-reinforced, calcium phosphate-based (CaP-Ti) implant with bone regenerative properties has previously been described in 2 case studies with the hypothesis that the implant may improve clinical outcome.
   OBJECTIVE: To identify whether the introduction of CaP-Ti implant has the potential to improve clinical outcome.
   METHODS: A retrospective review of all patients having undergone CaP-Ti cranioplasty was conducted. Comprehensive clinical data were collected from the hospital computer database and patient records. Bone formation and osseointegration were analyzed in a single retrieval specimen.
   RESULTS: Fifty patients, with 52 cranial defects, met the inclusion criteria. The patient cohort displayed a previous failure rate of 64% (32/50) with autologous bone, alloplastic materials, or both. At a median follow-up time of 25 months, the explantation rate due to either early postoperative infection or persistent wound dehiscence was 1.9% (1/53) or 3.8% (2/53), respectively. Surgical intervention with local wound revision was required in 2 patients without the need of implant removal. One patient had a brain tumor recurrence, and the implant was explanted 31 months after implantation. Histologic examination showed that the entire implant was partly yet evenly transformed into vascularized compact bone.
   CONCLUSION: In the present study the CaP-Ti implant appears to have improved the clinical outcomes in a cohort of patients with a high rate of previous cranioplasty failures. The bone regenerative effect may in particular have an impact on the long-term success rate of the implant.

AB OBJECTIVE: Data reporting percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) or percutaneous balloon kyphoplasty (PKP) application to the midthoracic vertebrae remain limited. This study aimed to summarize our experiences and explore the efficacy and safety of PVP or PKP in dealing with osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture (OVCF) in the midthoracic vertebrae.
   METHODS: Patients receiving PVP or PKP for midthoracic OVCF in our institution from January 2015 to January 2018 were retrospectively enrolled. All patients were grouped according to cement augmentation procedure types, surgical approaches, and puncture routes. All patients underwent a postoperative follow-up of 2-36 months. Visual analog scale (VAS) and ECOG Scale of Performance Status scores were evaluated pre- and post-operatively. Cement distribution and rate of cement leakage were assessed by radiographs. Associations of these variables and clinical scores and radiographic indices were analyzed.
   RESULTS: A total of 101 consecutive patients with 111 fractured centrums were enrolled. Both VAS and ECOG Scale of Performance Status scores of all patients decreased significantly after the operation, and progressively decreased at the final follow-up. The cement distribution of the bipedicular group was significantly better than the unipedicular group, but the total leakage rate of the former (71.7%) was significantly higher than the latter (43.1%). The rate of epidural cement leakage in the PKP group (5.4%) was significantly lower than that of the PVP group (20.3%), whereas the left puncture group (28.6%) was significantly higher than that of the right puncture group (2.7%).
   CONCLUSIONS: PKP and a bipedicular approach can help improve cement distribution and reduce the epidural cement leakage rate and therefore should be preferred over PVP or a unipedicular approach in OVCF of the midthoracic vertebrae.

AB OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to introduce our initial experience with the evaluation of the feasibility of using Willis covered stents (WCSs) in the treatment of complicated ophthalmic artery (OA) segment aneurysms.
   METHODS: Of the 162 patients with OA segment aneurysms treated by endovascular techniques in West China Hospital from January 2015 to August 2017, a total of 26 patients treated with WCSs were included in the study.
   RESULTS: Twenty-six patients with 26 aneurysms were included (mean age, 57.0 years; range, 22-76 years). The cohort had 20 patients with large or giant aneurysms, 3 patients with blood blister aneurysms, and 3 patients with pseudoaneurysms. Ten aneurysms were OA type, and 16 were internal carotid artery (ICA) type. Twenty-four patients were treated with 1 stent, and 2 patients were treated with 2 stents. Among the 26 patients, 2 patients had minimal endoleak, and 24 patients had complete occlusion after immediate postoperative angiography. One patient who had complete occlusion experienced contrast agent extravasation, and this phenomenon disappeared by balloon compression during the procedure. The 3- to 15-month angiographic follow-up showed that all patients experienced complete occlusion, including 2 patients with minimal endoleak during immediate postprocedural angiography. Two patient showed signs of in-stent stenosis. Clinical follow-up demonstrated that no delayed thromboembolic or ischemic events were recorded in the stent-grafted vascular region and no bleeding occurred in any of the patients (except 1 patient who experienced subarachnoid hemorrhage, left frontal lobe hemorrhage, and hydrocephalus 10 days after the procedure).
   CONCLUSIONS: WCSs may provide an alternative solution for treating complex OA segment aneurysms by reconstruction and preservation of the ICA. Our study also confirms the safety, efficacy, and midterm durability of WCSs for complex OA segment aneurysms.

AB BACKGROUND: The purpose of the present study was to describe our single-institutional experience of treating direct carotid-cavernous fistulas (DCCFs) with Willis covered stents (WCSs).
   METHODS: Of a total of 31 DCCFs, 10 were treated with WCSs (Microport, Shanghai, China) at West China Hospital from January 2015 to December 2016. The indications for treatment, perioperative findings, and postoperative and follow-up results were collected and analyzed.
   RESULTS: All 10 patients had successful deployment of WCSs. Complete exclusion of the fistula was achieved in 6 patients immediately after deployment of 1 stent. Endoleak was observed in 4 patients (patients 2, 4, 5, and 9). Thus, repeat dilation of the stent with greater pressure was performed, which resolved the endoleak in 2 patients (patients 2 and 9). The endoleak of the other 2 patients persisted after repeat dilation of the balloon. Hence, a second stent was deployed in these 2 patients (patients 4 and 5), which eliminated the endoleak in patient 4. However, patient 5 continued to have a minimal endoleak. Nine patients had fistulas successfully occluded by WCSs during the follow-up period. One patient experienced recurrence of a DCCF at the 10-day follow-up point. We chose coil embolization to address this DCCF. No stenosis of the internal carotid artery or DCCF recurrence, except that in the abovementioned patient, was observed.
   CONCLUSIONS: WCS was proved to be an alternative treatment method for complex DCCFs through reconstruction and preservation of the internal carotid artery. Our study also confirmed the safety, efficacy, and midterm durability of WCSs for complex DCCFs without any serious delayed complications.

   RESULTS: Seventy-four patients with intracranial chondrosarcoma (61 cases with MCS and 13 cases with CCS) were included. Compared with patients with CCS, patients with MCS presented at a younger mean age (21.1 years vs. 34.5 years, P < 0.001) and had a poor mean preoperative Karnofsky performance scale score (64.6 vs. 77.8, P = 0.014). Compared with CCS, MCS was less often located in the skull base (38.5% vs. 96.7%, P < 0.001) and had a larger tumor volume (87.8 cm(3) vs. 26.7 cm(3), P < 0.001). Rates of gross total resection in MCS and CCS subgroups were 41.1% (n = 25) and 46.2% (n = 6), respectively; rates of adjuvant radiotherapy postoperatively were 44.2% (n = 27) and 46.2% (n = 6), respectively. After mean follow-up of 41.7 months, 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year overall survival and progression-free survival of MCS were significantly shorter than overall survival and progression-free survival of CCS. Multivariate analysis revealed that tumor pathology and extent of surgery were independent predictors for tumor recurrence.
   CONCLUSIONS: Clinical features of MCS are quite different from CCS. Treatment strategies used for CCS do not yield satisfactory outcomes for MCS. Treatment of MCS should be aggressive and individualized.

AB OBJECTIVE: Hemorrhagic complications reported from external ventricular drain (EVD) placement range from 10% to 44%. There remains limited literature investigating the incidence, risk factors, and mechanisms to prevent its occurrence, especially in the setting of antiplatelet agent use. We investigated EVD-related hemorrhagic complications after the implementation of VerifyNow platelet inhibition assays at our institution.
   METHODS: Medical records from 445 patients requiring EVD placement during a 2-year period during which our institution used the assays were reviewed. In total 345 patients were included, and 208 of them underwent assay testing. Indications for EVD included complications of cerebrovascular disease (n = 215), traumatic brain injury (n = 74), primary hydrocephalus (n = 23), and tumor (n = 33). Hemorrhage was defined as any new area of hyperdensity adjacent to or immediately along the catheter trajectory on computed tomography.
   RESULTS: There was no significant decrease in catheter-induced hemorrhage (CIH) between patients who underwent the VerifyNow assay and those who did not. Platelet transfusion did not significantly decrease the risk of CIH. CIH occurred in 17.7% of patients, significantly decreased when compared with our previously published incidence of 33% before platelet inhibition assay use (P < 0.05). Patients with cerebrovascular disease complications exhibited a significant decrease in CIH, 20% versus 39%, before assay use (P < 0.01).
   CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of hemorrhage is lower in our new cohort when compared with that of our previously published cohort. Despite the overall decreased rate of hemorrhage, there was no significant difference in hemorrhage rates between patients who did or did not undergo the assay. Platelet transfusion did not decrease the incidence of hemorrhage in patients with inhibited platelet function.

AB BACKGROUND: Despite a significant number of patients being discharged to inpatient care facilities after anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF), the current literature remains limited regarding the predictors associated with a nonhome discharge and the impact of continued inpatient care in a facility on postdischarge outcomes.
   METHODS: The 2013-2016 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program was queried using Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes for ALIF (CPT-22558) and additional level fusions (CPT-22585). Discharge to inpatient care facilities included discharge to skilled care facilities and/or inpatient rehabilitation units.
   RESULTS: Independent predictors of an inpatient care facility discharge were age older than 45 years (P < 0.001), female sex (P < 0.001), more than 10% body weight loss in the last 6 months prior to surgery (P = 0.012), American Society of Anesthesiologists grade greater than II (P = 0.005), undergoing a 2-level (P < 0.001) or more than 2-level fusion (P = 0.017), a length of stay greater than 3 days (P < 0.001), and the occurrence of any predischarge complication (P < 0.001). After adjustment for differences in clinical and baseline characteristics between the 2 groups, discharge to an inpatient care facility after ALIF was independently associated with higher odds of any postdischarge complication (P = 0.010), postdischarge wound complication (P = 0.005), and postdischarge septic complications (P = 0.011). No significant impact was seen on 30-day readmissions (P = 0.943), 30-day reoperations (P = 0.228), and 30-day mortality (P = 0.913).
   CONCLUSIONS: With an increasing focus toward minimizing costs associated with postacute care, providers should understand the need of appropriate preoperative risk stratification and construction of care pathways aimed at a home discharge to reduce the occurrence and/or risk of experiencing postdischarge complications.

TI Surgical Outcomes and Comorbidities in Cushing Disease: 30 Years of
   Experience in a Referral Center
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY

DE Cushing disease; Pituitary; Radiotherapy; Transsphenoidal surgery
ID TRANSSPHENOIDAL SURGERY; SINGLE-CENTER; DIAGNOSIS
AB OBJECTIVE: Cushing disease (CD) is a rare, poorly understood entity. Our aim was to add our clinical experience of >30 years in a multidisciplinary specialized unit to the global knowledge of CD.
   METHODS: This descriptive retrospective study included all patients admitted to the Endocrinology and Nutrition Department of the Virgen del Rocio University Hospital, Seville, Spain, from January 1980 to May 2016. All patients had a definitive diagnosis of CD.
   RESULTS: Total sample included 119 patients; 100 (84%) were female. Median age at diagnosis was 37.97 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 25.89-45.07 years). Median follow-up was 88 months (IQR: 45.50-157.00 months). Most tumors were microadenomas (62/95) (5.1 mm [IQR: 4.0-7.0 mm]) without sinus invasion. Surgical procedures were conventional transsphenoidal surgery (CTSS) (101/108; cured 70 after first attempt) and expanded endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery (EETSS) (7/108; cured 5 after first attempt); 11 patients did not receive surgical treatment. Fourteen patients received radiotherapy after a first surgery and 5 patients after a second surgical removal attempt. In 13 patients (12.04%), CD relapse was demonstrated after initial CTSS (median disease-free period 65 months [IQR: 45-120 months]). Ten patients developed panhypopituitarism owing to the surgical procedure (CTSS); 8 patients developed panhypopituitarism after adjuvant radiotherapy.
   CONCLUSIONS: We observed slightly inferior cure rate after first surgery compared with moderately better relapse rates and time to relapse. Radiotherapy after surgery failure seemed to be more effective than CTSS; however, EETSS may be a valid alternative. Postoperative panhypopituitarism rate after first surgery was lower than expected; after radiotherapy, our results were comparable to other series.

ID STEREOTACTIC RADIOSURGERY
AB OBJECTIVE: We retrospectively analyzed treatment efficacy and identified prognostic factors impacting tumor control and survival in patients with brain metastases from cancer of unknown primary (CUP) treated with gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS).
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 87 patients with 520 tumors who underwent GKRS for brain metastases from CUP.
   RESULTS: The median overall survival time after initial GKRS was 6 months. The 6- and 12-month overall survival rates were 79.3% and 14.9%, respectively. Older age (P = 0.002), lower Karnofsky Performance Status Index score (P = 0.026), extracranial metastases (P = 0.013), and multiple brain metastases (P = 0.007) were significantly correlated with shorter survival periods. The 6- and 12-month neurologic death rates were 25.3% and 32.2%, respectively. The 6- and 12-month neurologic deterioration rates were 24.1% and 27.6%, respectively. The 6- and 12-month distant brain control failure rates were 21.8% and 24.1%, respectively. The median tumor volume was 1.7 cm(3). The median marginal prescription dose was 18 Gy. The 6- and 12-month tumor recurrence rates were 5.1% and 15.7%, respectively. Larger tumor volume (P < 0.0001) and lower prescription dose (P = 0.001) were significantly correlated with local tumor control failure. Seven patients had symptomatic radiation injury. The 6- and 12-month GKRS-related complication rates were both 6.9%.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that GKRS is a relatively effective and safe treatment for control of tumor progression in patients with brain metastases from CUP. Overall and neurologic survivals were short, but we recommend GKRS treatment to prevent early neurologic dysfunction and death in patients with CUP.

   TUMORS; RADIOTHERAPY; HEAD; OUTCOMES
AB OBJECTIVE: Large intradural growth of tympanojugular paragangliomas (TJ-PGs) into the cerebellopontine angle is an infrequent condition that can determine an extensive involvement of vessels and brainstem, representing a surgical challenge. The current classifications lack accuracy for defining large intradural TJ-PGs and assessing their operability. This study aims to retrospectively reappraise the management of a large intradural TJ-PGs surgical series, discussing operability criteria, treatment strategies, and resection techniques.
   METHODS: Over a series of 63 class D TJ-PGs operated on between 1973 and 2008, patients with large intradural tumors were retrospectively reviewed. Surgical techniques and outcomes with long-term follow-up were analyzed.
   RESULTS: Seven patients presented with large intradural tumors, ranging from 4 cm to 5.5 cm in diameter. These cases were treated either via a petro-occipital transsigmoid approach in a single-stage resection (4 patients) or via a petro-occipital approach as a second-stage surgery after a previous infratemporal fossa approach on the extradural tumor (3 patients). Complete tumor resection was obtained in 5 cases through wide removal of the petro-occipital skull base and exposure of the dural root of the tumor, which carries its main blood supply and allows preemptive hemostasis. No new postoperative cranial nerve losses were observed. The surgical procedure was aborted in 2 cases because of cerebellar edema and carotid artery tear, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: Large intradural TJ-PGs can be effectively surgically managed with an appropriate technique combined with relevant nonsurgical strategies. Thus, operability criteria for these lesions can be extended. To share objective experience on large intradural TJ-PGs, a redefinition of Di3 tumors is recalled.

ID NEURONAVIGATION; NEUROENDOSCOPY; NAVIGATION
AB BACKGROUND: Navigation (image guidance) is an essential tool in modern neurosurgery, and most surgeons use an optical tracking system. Although the technology is accurate and reliable, one often is confronted by line of sight issues that interrupt the flow of an operation. There has been feedback on the matter, but the actual problem has not been accurately quantified, therefore making this the primary aim of this study. It is particularly important given that robotic technology is gradually making its way into neurosurgery and most of these devices depend on optical navigation when procedures are being conducted.
   METHODS: In this study, the frequency and causes of line of sight issues is assessed using recordings of Navigation probe locations and its synchronised video recordings.
   RESULTS: The mentioned experiment conducted for a series of 15 neurosurgical operations. This issue occured in all these surgeries except one. Maximum duration of issue presisting reached up to 56% of the navigation usage time.
   CONCLUSIONS: The arrangment of staff and equipment is a key factor in avoiding this issue.

   body radiation therapy (SBRT)
ID CORD; RADIOTHERAPY; MANAGEMENT; RADIOSURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: In the setting of spinal metastases with epidural cord compression, radiosurgery is often only considered when there is sufficient separation between the epidural disease and the spinal cord. However, in patients who are nonsurgical candidates or those who prefer nonoperative management, there may be a benefit from stereotactic body radiation therapy, even when the epidural target is closer than the traditionally referenced 3 mm distance from the spinal cord. The purpose of this retrospective study is to evaluate our institution's experience in treating 20 such patients.
   METHODS: We reviewed records of all patients treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy for spinal metastases at our institution from January 2010 to January 2016, with follow-up through December 2016. The primary end point was local progression of disease. Local progression was defined as clear radiographic disease growth on follow- up imaging or worsening clinical symptoms in the absence of evidence for radiation myelopathy.
   RESULTS: Local control was obtained in 55% of patients meeting these criteria without a single case of radiation myelitis. Most patients with disease progression were able to undergo additional local treatment.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although local control was less than expected when compared with spine radiosurgery with adequate separation between the target and spinal cord, this treatment appears to be a viable option in the nonsurgical candidate.

AB BACKGROUND: Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating event often leading to poor neurologic outcomes. One of the most widely practiced treatments has been the administration of methylprednisolone. However, today its use has been called into question over concerns of efficacy and safety. The present study evaluated the changes in the practice of steroid administration in acute SCI among members of the National Spinal Society in Poland in comparison with the results of the survey conducted in 2013.
   METHODS: The questionnaire, comprising 5 questions, was distributed among 240 spinal surgeons, members of the Polish Society of Spinal Surgery; of these, 97 (40%) responded. The results were compared with data from the previous survey conducted in 2013.
   RESULTS: Over a period of 5 years, the prevalence of steroid administration in acute SCI has completely reversed; the proportion of steroid users declined from 73% to 27%. The main rationale for using it was belief in efficacy, rather than fear of litigation. The differences between specialization and age groups were not statistically significant in both administrations.
   CONCLUSIONS: A significant decrease was observed in the number of surgeons using steroids in the acute SCI, similar to that reported in the literature. The critical appraisal of the existing clinical evidence, as well as the formulation of guidelines by professional organizations, exerted a profound impact on the practice pattern.

AB BACKGROUND: The use of Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) for recurrent or residual vestibular schwarmorna (VS) after microsurgery (MS) has been investigated in several retrospective studies. The purpose of this study vvas to identify potential risk factors for both neurologic deterioration and tumor progression after GKRS for previously operated VSs in a prospective setting.
   METHODS: Patients who underwent GKRS for previously operated and his topathologically confirmed VS between 1998 and 2015 vvere prospectively followed-up. Risk factors for therapy side effects and predictors for tumor control were investigated in uni- and multivariate analyses.
   RESULTS: A total of 160 individuals with a median age of 55 years were included. Median tumor, volume prior to GKRS was 1.40 cm(3) (range, 0.06-35.80 cm(3)). After a median follow-up of 36 months, hearing and facial nerve function were serviceable (modified Gardner-Robertson and HouseBrackmann grades I and II) in 7 (5%) and 82 (55%) patients, respectively. Deterioration to a nonserviceable facial nerve function after GKRS was found in 3% (3/89) and tended to increase with rising tumor volume (odds ratio, 1.65 per cm(3); 95% confidence interval, 1.00-2.71; P = 0.051). Median tumor volume prior to GKRS was higher in patients with radiologic (P = 0.020) or clinical tumor progression (P < 0.001). Critical tumor volume prior to GKRS to predict clinical and radiologic tumor progression was 1.30 cm(3) (P< 0.001) and 3.30 cm(3) (P = 0.019), respectively. However, in multivariate analyses, none of the analyzed variables were found to independently predict tumor progression.
   CONCLUSIONS: Intended submaximal resection followed by GKRS is as viable treatment for VS. Because tumor remnant size after MS is an important predictor for recurrence after adjuvant GKRS, both brainstem and cerebellar decompression and maximal safely achievable resection should remain major goals of microsurgery.

DE Anatomy; Neurosurgery; Temporal bone; Three-dimensional; Virtual reality
AB OBJECTIVE: Learning complex neuroanatomy is an arduous yet important task for every neurosurgical trainee. As technology has advanced, various modalities have been created to aid our understanding of anatomy. This study sought to assess the educational value of a virtual, 3-dimensional (3D) temporal bone model.
   METHODS: The 3D temporal bone model was created with assistance of computer graphic designers and published online. Its educational value as a teaching was tool was assessed by querying 73 neurosurgery residents at 4 institutions and was compared with that of a standard, 2-dimensional (2D) temporal bone resource. Data were collected via a survey, and significance among responses was analyzed via a univariate chi-square test.
   RESULTS: The survey response rate was 37%. Greater than 90% of residents preferred to study with the 3D model compared with the 2D resource and felt that the 3D model allowed them understand the anatomy more realistically (P = 0.001). Moreover, >90% of residents believed that reviewing the 3D model before an actual surgery could lead to improved operative efficiency and safety (P = 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the utility of a novel, 3D temporal bone model as a teaching tool for neurosurgery residents. The model contains accurate anatomic structures and allows user interaction via a virtual, immersive environment.

AB BACKGROUND: It is not unusual to find neurosurgeons in the news and entertainment. The present study examined the portrayal of neurosurgeons by major print and online media sources.
   METHODS: Two search strategies identified articles from October 1, 2012 to October 1, 2017 containing the keyword "neurosurgeon." The top 25 newspapers in the United States, determined by their circulation, were searched using the LexisNexis Academic or NewsBank databases; a layman's Google News search was used to collect online stories. Each identified article was evaluated to confirm the relevance and then examined for content. Relevant characteristics for each article and neurosurgeon were determined and analyzed.
   RESULTS: Our searches returned 1005 articles comprising 561 unique stories about 203 different neurosurgeons. One particular neurosurgeon had 459 reports (45.7%). More articles were reported in 2015 (405; 40.3%) than any other single year. Most articles featured male neurosurgeons (879; 87.1%) and neurosurgeons who had been practicing for >20 years (636; 63.0%), with just 10 institutions accounting for the training of most of them (733; 72.6%). The articles were classified as positive (270; 26.9%), negative (356; 35.4%), or neutral (379; 37.7%) in terms of their reflection on the field of neurosurgery. The odds of a negative story were greater for male neurosurgeons, within 10 years of residency completion, and in a nonacademic position.
   CONCLUSIONS: Neurosurgeons are naturally subject to media coverage, and we must be cognizant that this predilection can serve as both an occupational advantage and an occupational hazard.

AB OBJECTIVE: Tranexamic acid (TXA) significantly reduces the visible and hidden blood loss associated with joint replacement. At present, many studies have examined the safety and effectiveness of the intravenous or topical administration of TXA after posterior lumbar surgery. However, randomized and controlled trials examining the presence of differences in the effect of TXA on the visible and hidden blood loss between these 2 modes of administration are lacking. The current study investigated the effects of intravenous and topical administrations of TXA on the visible and hidden blood loss of patients undergoing posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF).
   METHODS: In a single-center, placebo-controlled, randomized design, a total of 150 patients with lumbar degenerative disease who underwent PLIF between September 2015 and August 2017 volunteered for this study. Of these patients, 126 fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups: the intravenous administration group (n = 45, group A), the topical administration group (n = 39, group B), or the placebo group (n = 42, group C). SPSS, version 17.0, was used to analyze the patient data, their blood biochemical indices, blood loss, and the number of blood transfusions across the 3 groups during the perioperative period.
   RESULTS: The postoperative drainage volume, number of blood transfusions, length of hospital stay, and extubation time significantly differed between group C and both groups A and B (P < 0.05); however, no significant differences were noted between groups A and B (P > 0.05). Intraoperative blood loss and visible or hidden blood loss as well as the levels of postoperative hemoglobin and hematocrit significantly differed among the 3 groups (P < 0.01). The results of the visual analogue scale, prothrombin time, and fibrinogen content did not significantly differ among the 3 groups (P > 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: For patients undergoing double-segment PLIF, both administrations of TXA can reduce blood loss, extubation time, and the length of hospital stay. Moreover, intravenous administration can reduce both visible and hidden blood loss more efficiently.

ID CEREBRAL HYPERPERFUSION; INTRACRANIAL ANEURYSMS; HEMORRHAGE; DIVERSION
AB BACKGROUND: Hemorrhage and ischemia after flow diverter stent (FDS) procedures for intracranial aneurysms are the most common complications and have been extensively described. Temporary brain edema (TBE) is an unknown complication that could be associated with particular FDS procedures.
   OBJECTIVE: To estimate the frequency, clinical presentation, imaging findings, and possible mechanisms associating TBE with FDS.
   METHODS: Unruptured aneurysms treated with FDS implantation performed in our service from June 2015 to March 2018 were reviewed. Medical antecedents, endovascular procedure, clinical assessments before and after treatment, aneurysm characteristics, and image records were collected. Artery diameters of patients in whom TEB developed were also calculated to investigate any correlation between TBE and anatomic descriptors.
   RESULTS: A total of 179 FDS procedures in 176 patients were reviewed. Six patients (3.4%) presented with symptomatic TBE, and all TBE patients had undergone FDS implantation from the middle cerebral artery (MCA) to the internal carotid artery (ICA). A Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient (PPCC) found smaller MCA diameters and MCA/ICA ratios in these 6 patients (respectively PPCC = -0.619, P < 0.04; PPCC = -0.647, P < 0.03). Hemorrhagic and ischemic complications were less frequent than TBE (2.3% and 1.1% vs. 3.4%).
   CONCLUSIONS: TBE was more frequent than ischemic or hemorrhagic complications after FDS in this study. TBE seemed to be associated with a particular FDS positioning in small arteries, inducing flow changes and disruption of the blood-brain barrier.

AB BACKGROUND: Angiogenesis has been shown to be strictly related to tumor malignancy. Glioblastoma (GBM) is highly vascularized and von Willebrand Factor (VWF) plays a potent proangiogenic role. Dynamic contrast-enhanced and dynamic susceptibility contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) represent a widely accepted method to assess GBM microvasculature. Our aim was to investigate the correlation between plasma VWF: Ag, permeability, and perfusion MRI parameters and examine their potential in predicting GBM patient prognosis.
   METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed preoperative dynamic contrast-enhanced, dynamic susceptibility contrast MRI, and VWF: Ag level of 26 patients with GBM. We assessed the maximum values of relative cerebral blood flow and volume, volume transfer constant K-trans, plasma volume (V-p) and reflux rate constant between fractional volume of the extravascular space and blood plasma (K-ep). Nonparametric Mann-Whitney test and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were conducted and a P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
   RESULTS: The median VWF: Ag value was 248 IU/dL and the median follow-up duration was about 13 months. We divided patients according to low-VWF: Ag and high-VWF: Ag and we found significant differences in the median follow-up duration (19 months vs. 10 months; P = 0.04) and in K-trans (0.31/minute vs. 0.53/minute; P = 0.02), and K-ep (1.79/minute vs. 3.89/minute; P = 0.005) values. The cumulative 1-year survival was significantly shorter in patients with high-VWF: Ag and high-K-ep compared with patients with low-VWF: Ag and low-K-ep (37.5% vs. 68%; P = 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: These findings, in a small group of patients, suggest a role for VWF: Ag, similar to K-trans, and Kep as a prognostic indicator of postoperative survival of patients with GBM.

AB OBJECTIVE: It is unknown whether spinal instrumentation is required to prevent deformity after partial vertebrectomy in the treatment of primary bronchogenic carcinomas invading the spine (PBCIS). In this study, we focus on the postoperative spine deformity in patients who underwent operation for partial vertebrectomies without instrumentation during en bloc PBCIS resection. Our objective was to determine whether deformity depends on the type of vertebral resection and if any vertebral resection threshold can be observed to justify additional spinal instrumentation.
   METHODS: This is a retrospective study, including all patients with PBCIS operated without spinal instrumentation from 2009 to 2018. Partial vertebrectomies were classified into categories A, B, and C depending on vertebral resection. Patients had long-term radiologic follow-up to assess the spine deformity evolution.
   RESULTS: Eighteen patients were included. The median follow-up was 27 months. Four patients underwent a secondary posterior instrumentation surgical procedure due to progressive spinal deformity. A low-risk group of deformation was characterized as type A resection and type B resection on less than 3 vertebrae.
   CONCLUSIONS: There are no validated criteria to justify a systematic spinal instrumentation when performing a partial vertebrectomy during en bloc resection of PBCIS. Performed alone without spine instrumentation, both type A and type B resections on less than 3 resected vertebrae were not subject to sagittal and coronal deformity even after a long follow-up, emphasizing that a systematic stabilization is not needed in this low-risk group. These results could help to reduce the perioperative morbidity of these procedures that are usually long and complex.

AB BACKGROUND: Management of proximal (M1) middle cerebral artery (MCA) aneurysms can be challenging. Because of the diversity of aneurysm morphology and location of M1 aneurysms, the surgical strategy should be tailored to each individual case, especially for complex cases. We assessed the safety and efficacy of an algorithmic strategy for the management of M1 aneurysms.
   METHODS: A prospective single-center study of M1 aneurysms treated with microsurgery was performed. Our algorithmic strategy was determined by the location and complexity (e.g., size, shape) of the aneurysms. The surgical modalities included neck clipping, aneurysm resection and/or trapping, and proximal occlusion with revascularization. The clinical and radiographic data were analyzed.
   RESULTS: From January 2007 to March 2017, 92 proximal MCA aneurysms in 92 patients were treated microsurgically. Aneurysm treatment techniques included clipping in 55, proximal occlusion in 21, aneurysm resection in 11, and trapping in 4. Bypass techniques included 2 anterior temporal artery reconstructions, 5 middle cerebral bifurcation reconstructions, 4 parent artery reanastomoses, 2 interpositional bypasses, 25 high-flow bypasses, and 7 medium-flow bypasses. Overall, good outcomes (modified Rankin scale score, 0-2) were seen in 49 of 92 patients (53.3%) at discharge and in 79 of 91 (86.8%) at the last follow-up visit. On the latest angiogram, 78 of 90 aneurysms (86.7%) had been completely occluded without a remnant. Bypass patency was confirmed in 38 of 43 bypass procedures.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our present treating strategy might provide a benefit for patients with proximal MCA aneurysms.

ID DIGITAL-IMAGE-ANALYSIS; KI-67 LABELING INDEX; PROLIFERATION; SERIES
AB BACKGROUND: Immunohistochemistry is a basic diagnostic technique. Immunohistochemical examination results reflect mainly qualitative and less quantitative characteristics of proteomic status of cells. A combined approach with complex quantitative evaluation of marker expression using colorimetric analysis and computer technologies can expand the diagnostic capabilities of immunohistochemistry. We studied such an approach developed by using expression of the proliferative marker Ki-67 in pituitary adenomas.
   METHODS: A retrospective, blind, randomized, comparative study was performed of Ki-67 expression activity in pituitary adenomas using the traditional Ki-67 labeling index and a simple immunohistochemical cytocolorimetric analysis developed by us with immunohistochemical cytocolorimetric index (ICI) estimation as predictors of relapse, assessing the relationships of these indicators with the time before relapse.
   RESULTS: Mean Ki-67 labeling index was 3.87% +/- 0.29% in the relapse-free group and 4.01% +/- 0.29% in the relapse group; the difference was not statistically significant. The average Ki-67 ICI was 24.16% +/- 0.51% in the relapse-free group and 30.68% +/- 0.64% in the relapse group; the difference was statistically significant. The correlation coefficient of ICI values and time before relapse was -0.302, indicating the presence of a weak negative correlation.
   CONCLUSIONS: We successfully tested an ICI estimation method developed by us to assess Ki-67 expression in pituitary adenomas. The ICI technique can be used both as a prognostic factor for relapse and, in combination with other modern proteomic and genetic methods, as the basis for creation of new multimodal analyzing systems for functional state assessment of cells and tissues.

TI Mitochondrial Division Inhibitor 1 Prevents Early-Stage Induction of

AB BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence has implicated dysfunctional mitochondria in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disorders. Selective degradation of dysfunctional mitochondria has been termed mitophagy and constitutes a pivotal component of mitochondrial quality control to maintain cellular homeostasis. Mitochondrial fission plays a prominent role in controlling mitochondrial shape and function. However, it is unclear whether mitochondrial fission in the context of eliminating damaged mitochondria is involved in traumatic brain injury (TBI). We examined the role of mitochondrial division inhibitor 1 (Mdivi1), a small-molecule inhibitor of dynamin-related protein (Drp1), in general autophagy and mitophagy after controlled cortical impact (CCI).
   METHODS: Mitophagy and the role of Drp1 in this process after CCI were examined using Western blotting, electron microscopy, double immunofluorescence staining, neurological severity scores, and hematoxylin and eosin staining. Statistical analysis was performed using 1-way analysis of variance, followed by the least significant difference test or the Games-Howell test.
   RESULTS: The rats exposed to CCI exhibited induction of mitophagy and fragmentation of mitochondria. When fission was blocked with Mdivi1, the mitochondria became excessively long and interconnected. Inhibition of Drp1 blocked the induction of mitophagy specifically, which aggravated neurological manifestations and neuronal apoptosis. Mdivi1 activated caspase-3 and caspase-9, implying that selective degradation of damaged mitochondria by autophagy markedly decreased cell apoptosis induced by TBI and, thus, promoted cell survival.
   CONCLUSIONS: The findings from the present study support the hypothesis that Drp1-dependent mitochondrial fission contributes to mitophagy in TBI, and further understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of Drp1 will provide opportunities to develop novel strategies against TBI.

AB OBJECTIVE: To study the safety and performance of real-world thrombectomy using the SOFIA Catheter in our comprehensive stroke center.
   METHODS: We conducted a cohort study from a prospective clinical registry of consecutive stroke patients treated by mechanical thrombectomy between March 2016 and September 2017. Baseline clinical and imaging characteristics, recanalization rates, complications, and clinical outcomes were analyzed.
   RESULTS: Among the 140 patients included, 54 were treated using aspiration first, 64 were treated using aspiration and stent-retriever straightaway, and 22 were treated with SOFIA as a rescue device. Successful recanalization (Modified Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction score 2b/3) was achieved in 82.1% patients and good outcomes in 34.3%. Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage occurred in 7.1% and mortality in 25%.
   CONCLUSIONS: In our single-center experience, thrombectomy using the SOFIA as an intermediate or aspiration catheter provided high recanalization rates under everyday conditions.

AB OBJECTIVE: Patients undergoing surgical resection of meningioma are at increased risk for developing venous thromboembolism (VTE). The aim of this study was to assess occurrence of VTE in patients who underwent surgical resection of meningioma to determine risk factors and associated complications of VTE.
   METHODS: The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Project database from 2012 to 2015 was reviewed for patients who had undergone meningioma resection according to primary Current Procedural Terminology codes and International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision.
   RESULTS: The study included 5036 patients with meningioma. Rate of VTE was 3.38%, with pulmonary embolism rate of 1.47% and deep venous thrombosis rate of 2.42%. During the first 30 days after surgery, patients with VTE had a mortality rate of 5.88% compared with 1.15% for patients without VTE. Multivariate binary logistic regression analysis determined 5 risk factors for VTE,: age >= 60 years, American Society of Anesthesiologists classification III, operative time >= 310 minutes, ventilator dependence, and preoperative transfusions. Univariate analysis revealed a number of complications significantly associated with VTE occurrence, including unplanned intubation, ventilator use for >48 hours, stroke, sepsis, septic shock, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and transfusions.
   CONCLUSIONS: Risk factors of VTE and associated complications were identified. Understanding these risk factors provides physicians with further insight in managing this subgroup of patients in a personalized fashion in the perioperative period to minimize the incidence and morbidity of VTE.

AB BACKGROUND: Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are at an increased risk of surgical mortality. We aimed to investigate the factors associated with in-hospital mortality in patients with ESRD who underwent spinal surgery, which remains to be determined.
   MATERIAL AND METHODS: An age-and sex-matched cohort study was conducted using the Taiwan Longitudinal Health Insurance Database between January 2000 and December 2012. Kaplane-Meier curves were plotted with log-rank test to compare the differences between these 2 groups. The Cox proportional hazard model was used to estimate the hazard ratio of in-hospital mortality adjusted with potential confounding.
   RESULTS: In total, 4109 participants with pre-existing ESRD and 8218 patients without ESRD were included. The in-hospital mortality in ESRD (10.17%) was greater than without ESRD (1.39%). Spinal surgery patients with preexisting ESRD had a 6.78-fold increase in-hospital mortality risk compared with those without ESRD. Spinal surgery patients with ESRD of any age, male or female, and comorbidities experienced a greater incidence of hospital mortality. In patients with ESRD, operations on spinal cords and spinal canal structures had the greatest hospital mortality (14.87%) compared with spinal fusion (3.46%) or excision or destruction of intervertebral disc (3.01%). Kaplane-Meier survival curves showed that patients with ESRD experienced greater hospital mortality than patients without ESRD in all 3 spinal surgery methods (log rank P < 0.0001).
   CONCLUSIONS: Spinal surgery patients with ESRD have greater in-hospital mortality than patients without ESRD. Age, sex, history of comorbidities, and types of surgical methods were associated with greater in-hospital mortality among patients with ESRD.

AB BACKGROUND: Previous studies have indicated traumatic brain injury (TBI) as a risk factor for stroke and myocardial injury. Whether TBI increases new onset of major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) is not well established.
   METHODS: Patients with a diagnosis of TBI from 2000 to 2012 were 1: 2 age-, sex-, and age-adjusted comorbidities matched with normal population cohorts. The MACCE, which included coronary artery disease, heart failure and arrhythmia, ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, and death, was defined as one inpatient admission with MACCE diagnosis. The maximum follow-up duration to MACCE after the initial TBI diagnosis was 5 years. The baseline comorbidities before TBI, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, renal disease, and liver disease, also were considered to estimate the risk of MACCE.
   RESULTS: In total, 16,211 patients with TBI and 32,422 people from the control group were enrolled in the current study. Our results showed that patients with TBI had a 2.77-fold risk of MACCE, 1.72-fold risk of cardiovascular disease, 2.10-fold risk of ischemic stroke, 6.02-fold risk of hemorrhagic stroke, and 3.13-fold risk of mortality compared with the control group (all P < 0.0001) after adjusting the confounding factors. In addition, the trend of cumulated incidence risk among MACCE, cardiovascular disease, ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, and mortality presented the greatest incidence within the first year after diagnosis and persisted during the 5 years of follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that patients with TBI have a significantly greater risk of MACCE than the control group. We hope this information will remind critical-care physicians and neurosurgeons to keep in mind the long-term effects of TBI on MACCE.

AB BACKGROUND: High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein plays a key role in triggering inflammatory responses in many diseases. Our previous study showed that HMGB1 is found upstream of secondary damage in traumatic brain injury (TBI). We found that anti-HMGB1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) effectively decreased acute brain damage, including the disruption of the blood-brain barrier, brain edema, and neurologic dysfunction. This effect of anti-HMGB1 mAb lasts for at least 1 week. In this study, we explored subacute effects of anti-HMGB1 mAb after TBI.
   METHODS: TBI was induced in rats by fluid percussion. Anti-HMGB1 mAb or control mAb was given intravenously after TBI. Histochemical staining, plasma levels of HMGB1, motor activity and memory, and video electroencephalography monitoring were evaluated 2 weeks after fluid percussion injury.
   RESULTS: Anti-HMGB1 mAb remarkably attenuated accumulation of activated microglia in the rat cortex in the ipsilateral hemisphere after TBI. Anti-HMGB1 mAb also prevented neuronal death in the hippocampus in the ipsilateral hemisphere after TBI. Treatment of rats with anti-HMGB1 mAb inhibited HMGB1 translocation and suppressed impairment of motor function. The beneficial effects of anti-HMGB1 mAb on motor and cognitive function persisted for 14 days after injury. Treatment with anti-HMGB1 mAb also had positive effects on electroencephalography activity.
   CONCLUSIONS: The beneficial effects of anti-HMGB1 mAb continued during the subacute postinjury phase, suggesting that anti-HMGB1 mAb may prevent cognitive dysfunction after TBI.

AB BACKGROUND: Low back pain is a common public health problem associated with lumbar intervertebral disc degeneration. It is still unclear, however, whether intervertebral disc degeneration is an isolated process or accompanied by other degenerative events. We analyzed whether disc degeneration was associated with vertebral end-plate changes and fatty infiltration in the paraspinal muscles. We also aimed to identify whether the severity of disc degeneration influenced this association.
   METHODS: Intervertebral disc degeneration, vertebral end-plate changes, and fatty infiltration in the multifidus, erector spinae, and psoas muscles at all lumbar intervertebral disc levels were evaluated on lumbar spine magnetic resonance images of 50 symptomatic women and 50 age-matched symptomatic men.
   RESULTS: The women had greater lumbar intervertebral disc degeneration scores at L4-L5 and L5-S1 and in total. The women had more fatty infiltration in the multifidus and erector spinae muscles at L4-L5 and L5-S1. The men had more fatty infiltration in the psoas muscle at L5-S1. Patients with severe intervertebral disc degeneration were more likely to have increased fatty infiltration in the multifidus and erector spinae muscles. The rate of vertebral end-plate changes was also greater in the patients with severe intervertebral disc degeneration.
   CONCLUSIONS: Severe disc degeneration in the lumbar spine is closely associated with Modic changes and fatty infiltration in the multifidus and erector spinae muscles. We suggest that disc degeneration is not an isolated event but, rather, a continuum of events that could more clearly be shown in future prospective, large sample-size studies.

ID CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; DECOMPRESSIVE CRANIECTOMY; HEMODYNAMICS
AB BACKGROUND: This study was done to evaluate the effects of cranioplasty on cerebrohemodynamics (cerebral blood flow [CBF] and mean transient time [MTT]) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hydrodynamics (flow velocities) by using computed tomography perfusion and cardiacgated cine phase magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (phase contrast [PC] MRI), respectively. It also aims to determine the co-relation between changes in CBF, MTT, and CSF flow dynamics with neurocognitive outcome.
   RESULTS: The mean values of ipsilateral CBF were 27.58 and 41.66 mL/min/100 g in pre- and postcranioplasty patients, respectively (P=0.04). Contralateral CBF also showed improvement from 38.76 to 60.44 mL/min/100 g (P=0.03). Mean values of MTT were found to be decreased in the bilateral hemisphere after cranioplasty. On evaluation of CSF flow velocities by PC MRI, the means of the maximum velocity and peak velocity at the aqueduct of Sylvius were increased from pre-to postcranioplasty as 2.36 to 3.84 cm/s (P=0.048) and 1.21 to 3.50 cm/s (P < 0.001), respectively. Cognitive evaluation showed a significant improvement at 1 (P=0.035) and 6 months (P= 0.002) postcranioplasty.
   METHODS: All cases were subjected to precranioplasty cine phase cardiac gated contrast MRI for CSF dynamics and computed tomography perfusion for cerebrovascular hemodynamic parameters. CBF and related indices were calculated at different regions of interest with the help of the manufacturer's software package of computed tomography perfusion in the ipsilateral hemisphere and simultaneously on the contralateral side. Cine cardiac gated phase contrast MRI was also done for CSF flow velocity at the aqueduct of Sylvius and median aperture (foramen of Magendie). Both studies were again performed on postcranioplasty day 5-7.
   CONCLUSIONS: Cranioplasty can remarkably improve cortical perfusion for both the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres. Postoperative increased CSF velocities suggest improved rapid turnover of CSF in a circuit and possibly play a role in good neurologic outcome. Our study shows there is improvement in CSF flow at the aqueduct of Sylvius after cranioplasty. We propose that improvement in CSF circulation along with changes in CBF co-relate well with cognitive outcome (Montreal Cognitive Assessment score).

AB OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present study was to determine the learning curve for biportal endoscopic spinal surgery (BESS) for decompressive laminectomy in lumbar spinal stenosis using a learning curve cumulative summation test (LC-CUSUM).
   METHODS: The surgeon was proficient in open and microscopic decompressive laminectomy in lumbar spinal stenosis but did not have any experience with BESS or other endoscopic surgery techniques. The learning curve of BESS was investigated using LC-CUSUM analysis. Procedure success was defined as an operative time <75 minutes, the mean operative time with microscopic decompression laminectomy.
   RESULTS: The present study included the first 60 patients who had undergone single-level decompressive laminectomy using BESS by a single orthopedic surgeon. The mean operative time for decompressive laminectomy by BESS was 83.8 +/- 37.9 minutes. The mean operative time in the early learning period (<= 30 cases) and late learning period (second 30 cases) was 105.3 +/- 39.7 minutes and 62.4 +/- 19.9 minutes, respectively. The overall complication rate was similar to 10%. The LC-CUSUM signaled competency for surgery at the 58th operation, indicating that sufficient evidence had accumulated to prove that the surgeon was competent. Thus, a trainee with no experience with BESS had reached adequate performance at 58 cases.
   CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study have demonstrated that a substantial learning period could be needed before adequate performance can be achieved with lumbar decompressive laminectomy using BESS.

AB OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to analyze radiologic and clinical results with a minimum 5 years follow-up (FUP) of lateral lumbar total disc replacement for the treatment of symptomatic lumbar degenerative disc disease.
   METHODS: We performed a prospective, single-center, clinical, and radiologic study. Patients were treated with lumbar total disc replacement (extreme lateral total disc replacement) by a lateral transpsoas approach. From 2005 to 2012, 60 patients were enrolled (31 male, 29 female; total, 66 levels; average age, 42.8 years [standard deviation (SD), 9.7 years, range, 22-64 years]; mean body mass index, 26.0 [SD, 3.4]). Clinical end points included visual analog scale and Oswestry Disability Index questionnaires, complications, and reoperation. Radiographic end points included heterotopic ossification (McAfee classification), adjacent level disease, and prosthesis migration or subluxation.
   RESULTS: The mean surgical duration was 122 minutes (SD, 45 minutes) with mean 58 mL (SD, 21 mL) of estimated blood loss. No intraoperative complication occurred. The exceptions were 1 patient with postanesthesia apnea and 2 patients with quadriceps motor deficit (resolved within 4 months with physiotherapy). Of 60 patients, 9 were missed to FUP and 51 (85%) were enrolled in the study, with mean FUP of 92 months (range, 60-122 months). In total, 5 levels (9%; 5 of 55) required to be fused. Both removal of the prostheses and interbody fusion were performed by the lateral transpsoas approach. One patient experienced CrCo allergy (at 2 months); 4 experienced persistent pain from different causes (at 7, 9, 24, and 88 months). Five patients (10%) presented with progression at adjacent levels and 2 (4%) required surgery. One patient required sacroiliac fusion at 63 months. There were no complications during the retrieval surgeries. One partial disc migration occurred but the patient refused retrieval. There was no bone bridging in 9% of the discs (grade 0 heterotopic ossification): grade I, 22%; grade II, 31%; grade III, 20%; grade IV (fusion), 18%. Most heterotopic ossification cases (93%) occurred in the lateral aspect of the disc space, and mostly at the contralateral side of the surgical approach. Patient-reported outcomes significantly improved (P < 0.01) at the last FUP. Visual analog scale back pain score was preoperatively 8.5, early postoperatively 2.5, and at last FUP 3.1. Oswestry Disability Index was preoperatively 55%, early postoperatively 31%, and at last FUP 21%.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study presents mid-term to long-term results of extreme lateral total disc replacement artificial disc for the treatment of lumbar degenerative disease, with fast mobilization, sustained pain relief, and improved physical function. Despite the low rate of ALDis, some discs evolved to ankyloses and others were retrieved. Lumbar artificial disc replacement by the lateral approach seems to be a safe and effective treatment.

AB OBJECTIVE: To assess usefulness and limitations of flexible fiber carbon dioxide (CO2) laser in the microsurgical treatment of intraventricular tumors.
   METHODS: We reviewed a series of 9 patients treated with microsurgical resection of intraventricular tumors using a flexible fiber CO2 laser. The lesions involved the third ventricle (8) and the frontal horn of the right lateral ventricle (1). Histology revealed 6 craniopharyngiomas, 1 pituitary macroadenoma, 1 subependymoma, and 1 neurocytoma. In all cases, an interhemispheric transcallosal approach was performed. The laser was used during callosotomy, fornix column sectioning, tumor debulking, and to facilitate tumor dissection. We used a 5-tiered score system to assess laser's efficacy in each surgical step (approach, dissection, debulking): grade 1: laser was not at all helpful, grade 5: laser was extremely helpful. Limits of the instrument also are discussed.
   RESULTS: Gross total resection was achieved in 6 cases and subtotal resection in the remaining 3. Three patients had pulmonary complications treated without clinical sequelae. No laser-related complication was described. Mean utility score observed was 4.2 (range 3-5) during approach, 2.8 (range 2-4) during tumor dissection; and 3.3 (range 2-5) during tumor debulking. Main limits were low hemostatic effect and inefficiency versus calcified and highly vascularized tumors.
   CONCLUSIONS: The CO2 laser proved to be a useful and safe tool that could be used for intraventricular pathology; its design is suitable for narrow surgical corridors like interhemispheric fissure and foramen of Monro; its mainutility is the ability to create precise and relatively bloodless cut (callosotomy, tumor debulking); low hemostatic effect is its main limit.

AB OBJECTIVE: Spinal surgery is taught and practiced within 2 different surgical disciplines: neurological surgery and orthopedic surgery. We have provided a unified analysis of spine-focused faculty at U.S. residency programs.
   METHODS: A total of 278 Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education training programs were assessed to identify 923 full-time faculty members with a spinal surgery designation, defined by spine fellowship training or surgeon case volume >75% spine surgeries. Faculty were assessed with respect to parent discipline, years of fellowship training, academic rank, gender, and academic productivity (h-index).
   RESULTS: The spine-teaching workforce contains 55% orthopedic surgeons and 45% neurosurgeons with wide gender asymmetry overall and at all faculty ranks. Of the female spine surgeons, those with neurosurgical training (64.44%) nearly doubled the number with orthopedic training (35.56%). Academic productivity increased with academic rank similarly for both genders and subspecialties. Orthopedic spine surgeons had a greater mean fellowship number compared with the neurological spine surgeons. Fellowship time of completion (intraresidency/infolded vs. postresidency) did not significantly affect the h-indexes. Addition of fellowship conferred academic productivity benefit for orthopedic surgeons only.
   CONCLUSIONS: Neurological and orthopedic spine surgery showed similar patterns for the spread of faculty across academic ranks and trends in academic productivity. Marked gender disparity was seen in both neurosurgical and orthopedic surgery, with fewer female spine surgeons seen at every academic rank. Orthopedic spine surgeons had a greater mean fellowship number than did their neurosurgical counterparts, and a lack of fellowship correlated with lower academic productivity in orthopedic, but not neurological, spine surgery.

AB BACKGROUND: Although percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) is performed to restore the vertebral body height and kyphosis in osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs), the regained height may be lost on balloon deflation. This study compares PKP with modified percutaneous kyphoplasty (MPKP) in terms of the clinical outcomes in treating OVCFs.
   METHODS: Between May 2014 and March 2016, 76 patients with OVCFs were randomly assigned to 2 groups according to the procedure chosen: the PKP group (n = 36) and MPKP group (n = 40). Perioperative parameters, radiologic data, and other clinical parameters were compared between the groups.
   RESULTS: Of the 76 patients, 68 were followed-up for an average of 16 months. Both groups showed similar degrees of postoperative improvement on the visual analog scale, without any significant intergroup difference. However, the MPKP group showed greater improvement in vertebral body height and recovery of the Cobb angle compared with the PKP group. Additionally, the volume of bone cement and operative time were significantly higher in the MPKP group than in the PKP group, whereas the Oswestry Disability Index at the last follow-up was significantly lower in the MPKP group than in the PKP group. The cement leakage ratio and incidence of recurrent vertebral fractures did not differ significantly between the groups.
   CONCLUSIONS: MPKP prevents the loss of vertebral height observed with PKP during balloon deflation in addition to providing greater height, Cobb angle recovery, and quality of life compared with PKP in cases of OVCF.

   fusion
ID LOW-BACK-PAIN; OUTCOMES; LUMBAR
AB BACKGROUND: Significant progress in hardware and surgical techniques for sacroiliac joint (SIJ) fusion surgeries has facilitated safer and more efficacious procedures for patients. Triangular-shaped implants for SIJ fusions are the most-studied devices and have demonstrated good short-term and long-term clinical outcomes. Reports on cylindrical threaded implants are very limited. Owing to biomechanical differences in the implants and the surgical techniques required for their placement, previously reported results may not be applicable to cylindrical threaded implants. The aim of this study was to report preliminary clinical experience with minimally invasive SIJ fusion using intraoperative stereotactic navigation and the Rialto SI Fusion System.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 24 patients who underwent SIJ fusions between May 2015 and October 2017 performed by a single surgeon.
   RESULTS: Mean total satisfaction score was 89.0% +/- 27.6%. A statistically significant reduction (P = 0.0028) in low back pain scores was noted from an average baseline score of 6.6 +/- 2.4 to 3.7 +/- 3.3 postoperatively. Leg pain scores decreased from 4.8 +/- 3.8 to 1.5 +/- 2.9 (P = 0.0034). Mean surgical time was 53.0 +/- 13.9 minutes. It took significantly longer (P = 0.0089) to perform the initial 13 cases (59.9 +/- 15.2 minutes) compared with subsequent cases (45.4 +/- 7.3 minutes). Estimated blood loss was minimal (10.4 +/- 5.2 mL).
   CONCLUSIONS: Minimally invasive SI joint fusion using cylindrical threaded implants can be safely performed with minimal morbidity and good clinical outcomes.

   JUXTAFACET CYST; FACET CYSTS; SPINE; DIAGNOSIS; MANAGEMENT; RESECTION;
   RUPTURE
AB BACKGROUND: The pathogenesis of synovial cysts is largely unknown; however, they have been increasingly thought of as markers of spinal facet instability and typically associated with degenerative spondylosis. We specifically investigated the incidence of concomitant synovial cysts with underlying degenerative spondylolisthesis.
   METHODS: A literature search was performed using 4 online databases to assess the association between lumbar synovial cysts and degenerative spinal pathological features. Meta-analyses were performed on the prevalence rates of coexisting degenerative spinal pathological entities and treatment modalities. A random effects model was used to calculate the mean and 95% confidence intervals.
   RESULTS: A total of 17 studies encompassing 824 cases met the inclusion criteria. The pooled prevalence rates of concurrent spondylolisthesis, facet arthropathy, and degenerative disc disease at the same level of the synovial cysts were 42.5% (range, 39.0%-46.1%), 89.3% (range, 79.0%-94.8%), and 48.8% (range, 43.8%-53.9%), respectively. Among these, patients with coexisting spondylolisthesis were more likely to undergo spinal fusion surgery (vs. laminectomy alone) and reoperation than were patients without spondylolisthesis with a pooled odds ratio of 11.5 (95% confidence interval, 4.5-29.1; P < 0.0001) and 2.0 (95% confidence interval, 0.9-4.2; P = 0.088), respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a combination of synovial cysts and degenerative spondylolisthesis are more likely to undergo spinal fusion surgery than laminectomy alone compared with patients with synovial cysts and no preoperative spondylolisthesis. Furthermore, patients with synovial cysts and spondylolisthesis are more likely to require additional fusion surgery. The results from the present review lend credence to the argument that synovial cyst herniation might be a manifestation of an unstable spinal level.

LA English
DT Article
DE Complications; Outcomes; Spinal cord injury; Spinal fracture; Weekend
ID MORTALITY; OUTCOMES; IMPACT
AB OBJECTIVE: We sought to compare timing of intervention for patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) requiring surgical procedures during weekend versus weekday admissions.
   METHODS: The National Inpatient Sample database from 2012 to 2014 was queried to identify patients with SCI who underwent surgical treatment (decompression with or without stabilization) as an emergent/urgent procedure. Timing of intervention, inpatient morbidity, and inpatient mortality were compared between patients admitted during the weekend versus a weekday. Multiple logistic regression analyses were also performed.
   RESULTS: A total of 9390 patients were identified (mean age 55 years, 73.2% male) from the database, with 34.1% admitted during the weekend and 65.9% during a weekday. The average day of intervention for the entire cohort was 2.8 (SD 3.9, interquartile range 1-4); day 2.7 (standard deviation [SD] 4.0) versus day 2.8 ([SD] 3.9) for patients admitted in a weekend versus weekday (P = 0.418). After controlling for patient age, sex, and injury severity score on multiple logistic regression analysis, weekend admission was not significantly associated with early intervention (odds ratio [OR] 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.82-1.21; P = 0.993), complication occurrence (OR 1.09; 95% CI, 0.86-1.38; P = 0.476), or inpatient mortality (OR 0.83; 95% CI, 0.44-1.56; P = 0.563). Patients with complete/American Spinal Injury Association A injuries were more likely to undergo early intervention (OR 2.09; 95% CI, 1.31-3.31; P = 0.002).
   CONCLUSION: In this national study, patients with SCI who were admitted during the weekend received surgical intervention as early as patients admitted during a weekday. Furthermore, no differences in complication or mortality rates between groups were found.

   degeneration
ID PALLIDAL STIMULATION; SPASMODIC TORTICOLLIS; RATING-SCALES; BENEFIT
AB BACKGROUND: Cervical dystonia is a disabling medical condition that drastically decreases quality of life. Surgical treatment consists of peripheral nerve denervation procedures with or without myectomies or deep brain stimulation (DBS). The current objective was to compare the efficacy of peripheral denervation versus DBS in improving the severity of cervical dystonia through a systematic review and meta-analysis.
   METHODS: A search of PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science electronic databases was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Preoperative and postoperative Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS) total scores were used to generate standardized mean differences and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), which were combined in a random-effects model. Both mean percentage and absolute reduction in TWSTRS scores were calculated. Absolute reduction was used for forest plots.
   RESULTS: Eighteen studies met the inclusion criteria, comprising 870 patients with 180 (21%) undergoing DBS and 690 (79%) undergoing peripheral denervation procedures. The mean follow-up time was 31.5 months (range, 12-38 months). In assessing the efficacy of each intervention, forest plots revealed significant absolute reduction in total postoperative TWSTRS scores for both peripheral denervation (standardized mean difference 1.54; 95% CI 1.42-1.66) and DBS (standardized mean difference 2.07; 95% CI 1.43-2.71). On subgroup analysis, DBS therapy was significantly associated with improvement in postoperative TWSTRS severity (standardized mean difference 2.08; 95% CI 1.66-2.50) and disability (standardized mean difference 2.12; 95% CI 1.57-2.68) but not pain (standardized mean difference 1.18; 95% CI 0.80-1.55).
   CONCLUSIONS: Both peripheral denervation and DBS are associated with a significant reduction in absolute TWSTRS total score, with no significant difference in the magnitude of reduction observed between the 2 treatments. Further comparative data are needed to better evaluate the long-term results of both interventions.

DT Article
DE Neurosurgical outcomes; Neurotrauma; Subdural hematoma; Thromboembolism
ID BRAIN-INJURY; PROPHYLAXIS; THROMBOSIS; MORTALITY
AB BACKGROUND: Traumatic subdural hematomas (tSDHs) have high morbidity and mortality and often require neurosurgical intervention. The risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) after tSDH ranges from 1%-20%, yet a consensus chemoprophylaxis protocol does not exist. An increased understanding of VTE risk factors following tSDH may inform development of prophylaxis guidelines.
   METHODS: Retrospective analysis of a prospective, single-institution Level I trauma center database identified the incidence and risk factors for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) in consecutive tSDH patients from 1990-2015. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used.
   RESULTS: Of 3024 tSDH patients, 682 (22.6%) required neurosurgical intervention in the form of an intracranial pressure monitor, external ventricular drain (EVD), or craniotomy/craniectomy. Overall, 129 (4.3%) and 20 (0.7%) patients were diagnosed with a DVT or PE. Risk factors for DVT included age >= 60 (odds ratio [OR] = 1.5, P = 0.039), preexisting endocrine disorder (OR = 4.1, P = 0.001), hospital length of stay >= 7 days (OR = 4.7, P < 0.001), intensive care unit length of stay >= 7 days (OR = 3.6, P < 0.001), and lower extremity fracture (OR = 2.1, P = 0.004); GCS >3 was associated with a reduced DVT risk (OR = 0.6, P = 0.020). Risk factors for PE included intensive care unit length of stay >= 7 days (OR = 9.7, P < 0.001) and lower extremity fracture (OR = 4.7, P = 0.002). Neurosurgical intervention did not independently increase VTE risk but was associated with increased hospital length of stay (P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: While overall VTE risk is low following tSDH, elderly patients and those with severe injuries requiring prolonged hospitalizations have increased thrombotic risk. Development of tiered VTE prophylaxis regimens based on early postinjury thrombotic risk profiles warrants future study.

AB BACKGROUND: Despite recent treatment developments, back pain and related disabilities still represent a challenge for practitioners. Among the available surgical techniques, many different features and outcomes have been investigated; however, aesthetic result was missing among them. The present investigation was designed to prospectively compare patient-oriented aesthetic results after minimally invasive surgery (MIS) and standard open surgery (SOS) for the lumbar spine.
   METHODS: This was a prospective observational study with 1-year follow-up. Patients who underwent SOS were assigned to group 1 and MIS to group 2. Patient-oriented aesthetic result evaluation was collected using a dedicated visual aesthetic analogue scale. The Vancouver Scar Scale was used to exclude objective underlying influencing factors. The Oswestry Disability Index and a 10-point itemized visual analogue scale for back pain were administered to assess the clinical and functional status. Follow-up data were collected before discharge at 1, 6, and 12 months. Statistical analysis was conducted, and P < 0.05 was considered as significant.
   RESULTS: We enrolled 74 patients, 44 in group 1 and 30 in group 2. The 2 groups were homogeneous for demographic and clinical data. No clinical or functional differences were measured at the end of follow-up. Visual aesthetic analogue scale reported greater mean values in group 1 at every follow-up time.
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients seem to prefer the aesthetic result from a single midline incision after SOS compared with MIS. The use of specific techniques could be considered if there is scientific evidence reporting greater aesthetic outcome, having similar clinical and functional ones.

AB BACKGROUND: A plethora of reactive cellular responses emerge immediately after a traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) and may influence the patient's outcomes. We investigated whether serum concentrations of neuronspecific enolase, interleukin-6, glial-derived neurotrophic factor, and neurotrophic growth factor reflect the acute-phase responses to different etiologies of SCI and may serve as predictive biomarkers of neurologic and functional outcomes.
   METHODS: Fifty-two patients were admitted to the intensive care unit after SCI due to traffic accidents, falls, and firearm wounds and had blood samples collected within 48 hours and 7 days after SCI. Thirty-six healthy subjects with no history of SCI were included as controls. Neurologic and functional status was evaluated on the basis of American Spinal Injury Association and Functional Independence Measure scores over a period of 48 hours and 6 months after SCI.
   RESULTS: Serum NSE increased significantly 48 hours and 7 days after SCI compared with controls, while interleukin-6 increased only at 48 hours. In contrast, the neurotrophic growth factor level significantly decreased 48 hours and 7 days after SCI. Serum glial-derived neurotrophic factor level did not differ from control at any time point. Also, there was no significant difference in biomarker concentrations between the etiologies of SCI or the level of spinal injury. There were no correlations between biomarker levels at 48 hours with neurologic or functional outcomes 7 days and 6 months after SCI.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest expansive axonal damage coupled with an acute proinflammatory response after SCI. However, in our study biomarker concentration did not correlate with short- or long-term prognosis, such as survival rate or sensory and motor function.

   ABLATION; BLOCK
AB BACKGROUND: In the literature, there are only short series of radiofrequency of the sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG) to treat chronic refractory cluster headache (CCHr) with variable results. Furthermore, there is no consensus on which methodology to use: radiofrequency ablation (RFA) or pulsed radiofrequency (PRF).
   METHODS: We conducted a prospective analysis of 37 patients with CCHr who underwent RFA or PRF of the SPG in our center between 2004 and 2015.
   RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 40 years (range, 26-59 years). PRF was performed in 24 patients, and RFA was performed in 13 patients. A total of 5 patients (13.5%) experienced complete clinical relief of both pain and parasympathetic symptoms, 21 patients (56.8%) had partial and transient relief, and 11 patients (29.7%) did not improve. There was no evidence of significant superiority of one radiofrequency modality over the other (P = 0.48). There were no complications associated with the technique. The passage of time tended to decrease the efficacy of both techniques (P < 0.001). The mean follow-up was 68.1 months (range, 15-148 months). To our knowledge, this is the series with the largest number of patients and the longest follow-up period published in the literature.
   CONCLUSIONS: Radiofrequency of the SPG is a safe, fast, and partially effective method for the treatment of CCHr. Given its low rate of complications and its low economic cost, we think it should be one of the first invasive treatment options, prior to techniques with greater morbidity and mortality, such as neuromodulation.

ID ENDOSCOPIC ENDONASAL APPROACH; NASOSEPTAL FLAP; MORBIDITY; ADENOMAS
AB BACKGROUND: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak is a common complication after surgeries involving sellar reconstruction. Various techniques, including the nasoseptal flap, have been developed to limit postoperative CSF leak. However, the nasoseptal flap causes complications owing to donor site morbidity. A free mucosal graft may be just as effective in reducing CSF leaks as well as reducing postoperative nasal discomfort. This study aimed to assess operative outcomes of free mucosal graft after pituitary resection.
   METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed for patients who underwent endoscopic endonasal resection of pituitary adenomas. The following data were collected: demographic data, intraoperative CSF leak, postoperative CSF leak, other complications, and mucosal graft healing at 1 month. Also, the Sinonasal Outcome Test-22 was administered preoperatively and 1 month and 3 months postoperatively.
   RESULTS: Charts of 158 patients were reviewed, including patients who underwent no mucosal reconstruction, free mucosal graft reconstruction, and nasoseptal flap reconstruction. There was a 7.4% postoperative CSF leak rate in patients who underwent no reconstruction (n = 27), whereas postoperative CSF leak rate was 0.82% in patients undergoing free mucosal graft reconstruction (n = 122) (P < 0.05). Sinonasal Outcome Test-22 scores for patients with free mucosal graft reconstruction showed no significant worsening postoperatively.
   CONCLUSIONS: The free mucosal graft is a simple and effective means of sellar reconstruction in patients undergoing endonasal endoscopic pituitary resection, and its efficacy is similar to nasoseptal flaps. The free mucosal graft technique does not worsen sinonasal morbidity postoperatively.

AB OBJECTIVE: To present the clinical experience of 2 neurosurgical centers with the use of a 2-micron continuous-wave laser (2 mu-cwL) system as standard tool in neuroendoscopic procedures and to discuss the safety and efficacy of this system.
   METHODS: In total, 469 patients underwent neuroendoscopic procedures using 2 mu-cwL between September 2009 and January 2015. All patient data were retrospectively reviewed. In total, 241 (51%) patients were children and 228 (49%) adults. Mean age was 27.5 years (range: 3 days to 83 years). Intraoperative ultrasonography or neuronavigation were used to guide ventricular or cyst puncture and for intraventricular or intracystic orientation if necessary.
   RESULTS: A total of 524 neuroendoscopic procedures using 2 mu-cwL were performed. Laser-assisted endoscopic third ventriculostomy was the most common procedure in 302 (64%) patients. Cyst fenestration was performed in 124 (26%), septostomy in 45, tumor biopsy in 41, tumor resection in 8, and choroid plexus coagulation in 3 patients. There was no intraoperative complication directly attributable to the use of laser and an overall procedural complication rate of 4.8%.
   CONCLUSIONS: This large series of 2 mu-cwL as a routine tool in neuroendoscopic procedures demonstrates that 2 mu-cwL is safe for endoscopic third ventriculostomy, septostomy, cyst fenestration, and intraventricular tumor biopsy or resection. As a cutting and coagulation tool, it combines the action of mechanical tools like forceps, balloons, and scissors plus those of electric tools. It therefore renders neuroendoscopic procedures more straightforward with a minimum need to change tools.

DT Article
DE Disk adjacent to fusion; Disk arthroplasty; TDR; Total disk replacement
ID INTERBODY FUSION; FOLLOW-UP; ARTHROPLASTY; SURGERY; 2-LEVEL
AB OBJECTIVE: Cervical total disk replacement (TDR) has emerged as a motion-preserving alternative to anterior cervical diskectomy fusion (ACDF). Biomechanical studies have demonstrated that the TDR preserves motion at the diseased segment and minimizes motion and stress at adjacent segments compared with fusion. There has been growing interest in performing a TDR adjacent to a cervical fusion. The purpose of this study was to investigate the kinematics of a TDR after sequentially fusing adjacent segments.
   METHODS: Seven fresh-frozen human cadaveric cervical spine specimens from C1-T1 were used (average age, 56.2 +/- 7.3 years). The effect on cervical flexion-extension motion, by instrumenting a TDR above or below a 1-, 2-, or 3-level fusion, was measured. The protocol consisted of taking fluoroscopic images of each cervical specimen obtained at maximal angular displacement in flexion and extension during force application. Cobb angles were measured on digital radiographs to determine flexion-extension range of motion (ROM).
   RESULTS: Segmental ROM of the C6-7 TDR in the unfused spine was 11.3 degrees +/- 1.9 degrees. After performing a 3-level fusion at C3-6, the motion of the C6-7 TDR increased to 12.9 degrees +/- 1.3 degrees (P = 0.33). ROM of the C2-3 TDR in the unfused spine was 5.0 degrees +/- 1.1 degrees. After performing a 3-level fusion of C3-6, the C2-3 TDR segmental motion was 6.1 degrees +/- 1.3 degrees (P = 0.09).
   CONCLUSIONS: Biomechanically performing a cervical TDR adjacent to a long-segment fusion did not subject the implant to significantly greater motion than when the TDR was instrumented alone.

   LIMITATIONS; IDENTIFICATION; PERFUSION; EFFICACY; LOCATION
AB BACKGROUND: Indocyanine green (ICG) video-angiography can assess cerebral blood flow, but results are primarily qualitative. FLOW 800 software measures fluorescence dynamics and creates a semiquantitative color delay map for assessment of relative sequence of blood flow within the vasculature.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 23 consecutive patients for whom FLOW 800 ICG videoangiography was used. They harbored aneurysms, arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), dural arteriovenous fistula (dAVF), or hemangioblastoma. Patients' characteristics, FLOW 800 data, and clinical findings were recorded. Color map data were readily available intraoperatively and guided surgery.
   RESULTS: The cohort included 10 patients with AVMs, 11 with aneurysms, 1 with dAVF, and 1 with hemangioblastoma. Approximately two thirds of patients underwent intraoperative angiography. FLOW 800 data provided semiquantitative data regarding localization, flow status in major feeding arteries, and dominance of the arterialized draining veins for AVMs, more than data from ICG videoangiography alone. For complex aneurysms, color maps confirmed relative adequate flow in parent and branching vessels. For the foramen magnum dAVF, the location of the dominant transdural connection was appreciated only via flow analysis. Flow analysis created the blood flow map of a large complex solid brainstem hemangioblastoma and guided devascularization. All FLOW 800 findings agreed with intraoperative and postoperative angiography.
   CONCLUSIONS: ICG videoangiography with FLOW 800 analysis can provide semiquantitative and relative flow magnitude data that are efficient and noninvasive. This process helps identify early arterialized veins and their flow status during AVM and dAVF surgery and can confirm adequate relative flow within branching vessels during aneurysm surgery when clip-induced stenosis is suspected.

AB BACKGROUND: Cervical sagittal imbalance compromises health-related quality of life and can lead to myriad incapacitating symptoms through compression of the spinal cord. Questions regarding which parameters play primary roles in the progression of cervical sagittal imbalance and which might be compensatory factors remain unanswered.
   METHODS: This study enrolled 246 asymptomatic volunteers from July 2016 to June 2018. After demographic and radiologic parameters were measured, the data were analyzed using correlation coefficient test and multiple regression analysis. A predictive equation was assessed with variance analysis, residual analysis, collinearity analysis, and a paired t test.
   RESULTS: Average values are as follows: orbital tilt, 64 +/- 6 degrees; orbital slope (OS), 15 +/- 6 degrees; C0-C2 lordosis (C0C2), 28 +/- 8 degrees; cervical lordosis (CL), 5 +/- 11 degrees; C2-C7 sagittal vertical axis (C2C7SVA), 15 +/- 8 mm; T1 slope (TS), 17 +/- 6 degrees; thoracic inlet angle, 69 +/- 8 degrees; thoracic kyphosis, 34 +/- 9 degrees; lumbar lordosis, 50 +/- 10 degrees; sacral slope, 38 +/- 7 degrees; pelvic index, 48 +/- 9 degrees; sagittal vertical axis, 10 +/- 19 mm. Correlations of C2C7SVA were observed with body mass index (BMI), OS, C0C2, CL, and TS. The validated predictive equation was: C2C7SVA = 0.38 x BMI - 0.73 x OS + 0.73 x C0C2 + 0.15 x CL + 0.18 x TS - 6.53.
   CONCLUSIONS: BMI, OS, C0C2, CL, and TS were primary influencers in the progression of cervical sagittal imbalance and established a predictive equation of asymptomatic population, which can provide clinical advice and remind surgeons of the primary influencers of reconstructive surgery for better prognoses.

ID 4TH VENTRICULAR NEUROCYSTICERCOSIS; TRANSAQUEDUCTAL REMOVAL
AB BACKGROUND: Around 7%-33% of cases of neurocysticercosis (NCC) have intraventricular involvement, and the fourth ventricle is the most frequent site. Medical management and various surgical approaches have been described for treating this disease. The objective of this study was to describe technical modification for endoscopic fourth ventricular NCC removal in a series of 5 cases.
   METHODS: In this study (January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2017), all cases of fourth ventricular NCC which were treated with a special technique (endoscopic transcortical transforaminal transaqueductal approach) using a rigid endoscope system and 6-French infant feeding tube (IFT) were included in the study. The IFT was passed through the main channel, the cyst was engaged at the tip by applying gentle suction with a 20 cm(3) syringe, and the cyst was removed along with the whole endoscopic assembly. Patient's clinical, radiologic, and follow-up data were retrieved from the department database records.
   RESULTS: Five patients (3 men, 2 women; mean age, 20 years; range, 11-27 years) were enrolled. All patients had features of raised intracranial pressure. Two patients also had drop attacks, and one presented with altered sensorium and one had upgaze palsy. Duration of symptoms ranged from 3 months to 3 years. All patients had isolated fourth ventricular NCC with obstructive hydrocephalus. Complete removal of the neurocysticercal cyst could be performed in all patients without any injury to the periaqueductal region or fornix. There was no intraoperative rupture of the neurocysticercal cyst. On follow-up (range, 12-28 months; mean, 19.4 months), all patients had relief of symptoms and imaging showed no cyst and hydrocephalus.
   CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that our endoscopic approach is safe, simple, cost-effective, and allows minimally invasive removal of the fourth ventricle cyst and treatment of hydrocephalus without any morbidity.

AB BACKGROUND: The objective of our study was to describe the local control (LC) outcomes with 3- or 5-fraction stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) to the spine in patients with oligometastatic (<= 5 systemic metastases) versus polymetastatic disease (>5 metastases).
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the outcomes of patients who had undergone SBRT for spinal metastases. No patients had undergone previous surgical intervention or had spinal cord compression. All patients were treated with 3- fraction (median dose, 27 Gy; range, 24-30 Gy) or 5-fraction (median dose, 35 Gy; range, 25-40 Gy) SBRT. The Kaplan-Meier method and Spine Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology criteria were used to determine LC.
   RESULTS: We included 61 patients with a total of 72 distinct SBRT targets who had been treated from August 2007 to June 2017. The median follow-up period was 13.58 months. We treated 20 targets and 52 targets with 3 and 5 fractions, respectively. Thirteen patients (18.1%) had undergone previous RT to the SBRT area. Twenty patients (35% of the distinct SBRT targets) had an oligometastatic disease state. The 1-year LC rate was 83% for the entire cohort. On univariable analysis, polymetastases (1-year LC, 73.8% vs. 100%; P = 0.07) showed a trend toward worse LC. On multivariable analysis, patients with an oligometastatic state (hazard ratio, 0.21; P = 0.04) had improved LC.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our study was hypothesis-generating in that patients with an oligometastatic disease state appear to have improved LC after SBRT, suggesting a biological advantage exists with local therapy for this group of patients not seen for patients with polymetastatic disease.

ID INTRACRANIAL ANEURYSMS; EMBOLIZATION DEVICE; STENT APPOSITION;
   HEMODYNAMICS
AB BACKGROUND: Flow diverter stents have become a useful tool for treatment of complex intracranial aneurysms. A serious complication is incomplete wall apposition after flow diverter placement. The aim of this study was to present a comprehensive investigation of hemodynamic changes induced by incomplete expansion of a flow diverter.
   METHODS: A case of a patient treated for an internal carotid artery aneurysm by flow diversion with incomplete wall apposition was virtually investigated. The effect of incomplete flow diverter expansion was studied using image-based blood flow simulations under physiologically relevant flow conditions based on patient-specific clinical data.
   RESULTS: The numerical results revealed that incomplete expansion at the proximal end of the stent had minimal impact on the intra-aneurysmal blood flow alteration. A region of nonphysiologically high wall shear stress was observed near the contact area between the incompletely expanded proximal end of the flow diverter and the parent artery, which caused an intimal hyperplasia in this region. These simulation results were consistent with the real-life clinical course and outcome.
   CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study can be considered during treatment planning of complex cases where the risk of incomplete flow diverter expansion exists. Further studies are required before results can also be used to support the decision process about antiplatelet therapy and additional interventions to improve wall apposition.

AB BACKGROUND: Patients with far lateral disc herniation (FLDH) experience more severe pain and sensory symptoms compared with those with paracentral disc herniation. In addition, surgical intervention has both been more challenging and resulted in poorer outcomes,
   METHODS: We report our experience with a operative computed tomography (CT) navigation-assisted minimally invasive tubular microdiscectomy via a paramedian approach with electrophysiological monitoring for precise 3-dimensional anatomical localization and early electrophysiological identification of the exiting nerve.
   RESULTS: Five patients presenting with weakness and pain refractory to conservative management underwent iCT navigation surgery for lumbar FLDH with electrophysiological monitoring. The mean decrease in the visual analog scale pain score was 7.1 and the modified MacNab criteria outcomes were good in 1 patient and excellent in 4 patients.
   CONCLUSIONS: These results from a small group of patients suggest this is a safe approach with the potential for improved outcomes in the surgical treatment of FLDH.

AB BACKGROUND: Microscopic anterior cervical foraminotomy (MACF) is a surgical technique for unilateral cervical radiculopathy that preserves segmental motion and avoids adjacent segmental degeneration, but little is known of its long-term outcomes.
   METHODS: A retrospective minimum 10-year follow-up study was conducted on patients treated by 1 surgeon. Clinical outcomes were assessed using a visual analog scale of neck and arm pain, Neck Disability Index, and Odom criteria. Surgical outcomes were assessed using additional procedure rates. Radiologic outcomes were estimated by measuring disc heights, segmental angles, and range of motion at the surgical level and adjacent segments, and so on.
   RESULTS: Of the 94 patients who underwent MACF between January 2000 and December 2004 by 1 surgeon, 69 were enrolled in this study. Median follow-up period was 11.9 years (range, 10.0-14.5 years).
   Visual analog scales for neck or arm pain and Neck Disability Index improved significantly during follow-up period (P < 0.001). Also, according to the Odom criteria, an excellent or good outcome was achieved in 62 patients (89.9%) at final follow-up.
   An additional procedure was performed in 10 patients (14.5%) for symptom recurrence during the follow-up period. The only risk factor found to be related to the need for an additional procedure was a small preoperative range of motion at the surgical level (P = 0.018).
   Although mean disc height at the surgical level decreased significantly (from 6.23 +/- 1.10 to 5.17 +/- 1.12 mm; P = 0.004), adjacent discs were not significantly affected.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although some radiologic results have shortcomings, the results of this study suggest that MACF has favorable long-term outcomes.

AB BACKGROUND: The ideal surgery for a blood blister-like aneurysm (BBA) in the internal carotid artery (ICA) involves complete termination of blood flow into the BBA by trapping of the ICA at sites both proximal and distal to the BBA. In the present report, we describe a clipping method with ICA trapping for prevention of anterior choroidal artery ischemia, a major problem in ICA trapping with reconstruction surgery using external carotid artery-middle cerebral artery high-flow bypass (HFB).
   METHODS: The data from patients with a ruptured BBA treated by the combination of ICA trapping and blood flow reconstruction from 2008 to 2018 were retrospectively evaluated.
   RESULTS: Fifteen patients had been treated with the combination surgery. Clip placement for ICA trapping depended on the relationship between the distal neck of the BBA and the posterior communicating artery. In the case of the BBA distal neck located at the same level or distal to the posterior communicating artery, oblique placement of a distal clip to the ICA was mandatory to maintain blood flow of the anterior choroidal artery. No patients developed recurrence of the BBA after trapping. The outcomes were assessed using the modified Rankin scale score, with a score of 0 or 1 in 12 of the 15 patients (80%).
   CONCLUSIONS: A complete shutdown of blood flow to the BBA by ICA trapping is essential for the permanent prevention of BBA recurrence. In cases of a BBA distal neck located distal to the posterior communicating artery, the oblique clipping technique applied to the ICA is useful to prevent ischemic complications of the anterior choroidal artery.

AB BACKGROUND: Spine pathology is a common reason for admission to neurosurgical units in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and can have high morbidity rates from lack of specialized institutes. However, good surgical outcomes and quality-of-life scores have been reported in LMICs.
   This study details the complication rates and predictive factors from spine surgery at a large hospital in Cambodia, aiming to identify high-risk patients to improve surgeon understanding of these complications for improved preoperative planning and patient counseling.
   METHODS: This is a retrospective review of patients admitted for spine conditions to Preah Kossamak Hospital in Phnom Penh, Cambodia (2013-2017). Univariate analysis was conducted on potential predictive factors; variables with P < 0.1 were entered into multivariate logistic regression models.
   RESULTS: Seven hundred seventy-three patients were included. Forty-six patients had complications including wrong level surgery, hardware failure, and infection. On multivariate analysis, patients from the provinces of Kratie (P = 0.009) or Sihanoukville (P = 0.036), and those that delayed seeking care for more than 1 year after injury (P = 0.027), were significant predictive factors of postoperative complications, and American Spinal Injury Association grade A injury (P = 0.020) was a predictive factor of poor outcome.
   CONCLUSIONS: Many factors play a role in spine surgery complications in LMICs, including limited access to intra-operative technology, low follow-up rates, and minimal physiotherapy and rehabilitation capabilities. Patients with long delays in presentation, American Spinal Injury Association grade A injuries, and lumbar-level surgery may be especially susceptible to complications and postoperative morbidity. Despite this, institutions have reported encouraging spine trauma outcomes, and spine surgeries are becoming more accepted and safe operations in many LMICs.

   spread; Positron emission tomography; Prostate cancer; Sciatic nerve
ID LUMBOSACRAL PLEXOPATHY
AB BACKGROUND: The perineural spread of prostate cancer into pelvic peripheral nerves is a rare, but increasingly recognized, entity. This form of metastasis invades the lumbosacral plexus via the splanchnic nerves innervating the prostate. The prevalence of perineural spread is likely underappreciated, and further imaging-based studies are needed to elucidate its true frequency.
   METHODS: A retrospective review was performed using an institutional radiology database. Medical reports from patients with prostate cancer who had undergone positron emission tomography (PET) imaging were queried for terms suggestive of perineural spread. PET and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) from the identified patients were blindly reviewed for peripheral nerve involvement by 2 nuclear medicine and 2 musculoskeletal radiologists.
   RESULTS: A total of 22 patients were identified. After review by the radiologists, 16 patients had positive findings of perineural spread found on PET and 15 had abnormalities found on MRI involving lumbosacral plexus neural elements. All patients with biopsy-proven neoplastic perineural spread (including 1 patient with malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor) had positive findings on both PET and MRI. All patients with biopsy-proven inflammatory lesions had negative PET and variable MRI findings.
   CONCLUSIONS: The perineural spread of prostate cancer might be more common than previously thought. The use of multimodal imaging for patients suspected of having perineural spread should be a part of the treatment algorithm. Targeted fascicular biopsy might be indicated for patients with progressive neurological deficit and an unclear diagnosis.

AB OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) space on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) correlates with the outcomes of anterior controllable antedisplacement and fusion (ACAF) for ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL).
   METHODS: A total of 53 patients with OPLL who had undergone ACAF were enrolled. The Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) scale, visual analog scale, and neck disability index were used to evaluate the clinical outcomes. The area of CSF space and spinal cord on T2-weighted MRI, the occupying rate of the CSF space and spinal cord, and the postoperative MRI score of the CSF space were measured. The patients were divided into 2 groups according to the JOA score improvement rate (IR). The relationship between the postoperative MRI score and the JOA score IR was analyzed.
   RESULTS: The patients in group A experienced better recovery compared with those in group B regarding the JOA, visual analog scale, and neck disability index score at the final follow-up visit. On both axial and sagittal T2-weighed MRI, patients in group A experienced lower improvement of the area of the spinal cord than in group B (P > 0.05). However, the mean improvement in the CSF space in group A was better than that in group B (62.86 +/- 30.05 mm(2) vs. -6.36 +/- 24.58 mm(2); P < 0.05), with a greater occupying rate of CSF space in group A at the final visit. A strong correlation was noted between the JOA score IR and postoperative CSF space score (P < 0.01).
   CONCLUSION: These results suggest that ACAF could provide good decompression of the spinal cord and neurological improvement. Also, recovery of the CSF space correlated closely with the surgical ACAF outcomes for cervical myelopathy due to OPLL.

AB BACKGROUND: Postoperative ileus is not uncommon after spinal surgery. Although previous research has focused on the frequency of ileus formation, little has been done to investigate the clinical sequelae after development. We investigated the effect of postoperative ileus on patients' length of stay and rates of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) formation, myocardial infarction (MI), aspiration pneumonia, sepsis, and death.
   METHODS: The Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project National Inpatient Sample was queried to identify adult patients who underwent any spinal fusion procedure. Patient characteristics and outcomes for discharges involving spinal fusion surgery were compared between patients with and without postoperative ileus. The Rao-Scott chi(2) test of association was used for categorical variables, and a t test for equality of means was used for continuous variables. Among discharges with postoperative ileus, a multivariate linear regression model was used to assess how fusion approach and fusion length were associated with length of hospital stay, controlling for sex, age, and race.
   RESULTS: A total of 250,221 patients were included. The mean length of stay was 3.75 days for patients without postoperative ileus and 9.40 days for patients with postoperative ileus. Patients with postoperative ileus are more likely to have DVT (4.1% vs. 20.8%, P < 0.001), MI (2.5% vs. 7.1%, P < 0.001), aspiration pneumonia (6.6% vs. 34.3%, P < 0.001), sepsis (5.7% vs. 35.7%, P < 0.001), and death (2.6% vs. 11.4%, P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that patients with postoperative ileus are significantly more likely to have DVT, experience MI, acquire aspiration pneumonia, develop sepsis, and die.

AB OBJECTIVE:Spinal arteriovenous fistulas at the filum terminale (filum AVFs) are rare. Treatment strategies have not yet been established, particularly for cases of filum AVF with lipoma.
   METHODS:We report 7 cases of filum AVF with (n = 3) or without (n = 4) a tethered spinal cord by sacral terminal lipoma, with a focus on angiographic and operative findings.
   RESULTS:All 7 patients (median age, 73 years; range, 40-84 years; men: n = 5) presented with slowly progressive paraparesis, lower extremity sensory disturbances, and bladder/bowel disturbances. Filum AVFs were fed by the filum artery, the distal segment of the anterior spinal artery supplied from the artery of Adamkiewicz. The arteriovenous shunt was located at the filum terminale and drained via the ascending filum vein. In 3 patients with filum AVFs without lipoma, the artery of Adamkiewicz originated from the thoracic segmental artery. In contrast, in 3 patients with filum AVFs with lipoma, the artery of Adamkiewicz originated from the lower lumber or sacral artery because of low-lying conus medullaris. In all patients, filum AVFs were completely obliterated by microsurgical resection of the filum terminale including the arteriovenous fistula. Recurrence was not reported in the follow-up period (median, 64 months), except for 1 patient who required additional surgery because of complex neurovascular structures.
   CONCLUSIONS:Caution is needed when identifying the spinal level of occlusion of the fistula, particularly in cases of a tethered spinal cord by lipoma, because the feeding artery is associated with the artery of Adamkiewicz, which supplies the low-lying spinal cord in the sacral region.

   Stereotactic technique
ID GEOMETRIC DISTORTION; MRI SYSTEMS; FIELD; RADIOTHERAPY; IMAGES
AB BACKGROUND: With application of 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to functional neurosurgery procedures and given the inherent requirement of millimetric precision, the need to develop a method for correction of geometric image distortion emerged. The aim of this study was to demonstrate clinical safety and practical viability of a correction protocol in patients scheduled to undergo stereotactic procedures using 3T MRI.
   METHODS: This prospective study comprised 20 patients scheduled to undergo computed tomography (CT) stereotactic functional procedures or encephalic brain lesion biopsies. The CT images were references for MRI geometric accuracy calculations. For each scan, 2 images were obtained: normal and reversed images. Eight distinct points on CT and MRI were selected summing 152 points that were based on a power analysis calculation value >0.999. One patient was excluded because of the inability to find reliable common landmark points on CT and MRI.
   RESULTS: The distortion range was 0-5.6 mm and increased proportionally with stereotactic isocenter distance, meaning the distortion was greater in the periphery. After correction, the minimum and maximum distortion found was 0 mm and 3.5 mm, respectively. There was no significant difference between CT and MRI corrected x-coordinates (P > 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method can satisfactorily correct geometric distortions in clinical 3T MRI studies. Clinical use of the technique can be practical and efficient after software automation of the process. The method can be applied to all spin-echo MRI sequences.

AB BACKGROUND: The management of brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) remains a controversial topic. Given the relatively low incidence, high heterogeneity, and high morbidity and mortality of these lesions, consensus on treatment strategies is an issue of concern to organized neurosurgery. The present retrospective analysis examined and quantified the outcomes of patients with an initial presentation of intracranial hemorrhage from a Spetzler-Martin grade III or IV AVM, later ruled out as surgical candidates.
   METHODS: A total of 16 patients (5 females; 11 males) had presented with symptomatic hemorrhage confirmed by non-contrast-enhanced computed tomography and were deemed to not be surgical candidates owing to AVM location and/or architecture. The patients underwent combined endovascular embolization and gamma knife stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). The modified Rankin scale was used to measure the clinical outcomes, comparing the scores at presentation, gamma knife treatment, and the last known follow-up examination. A radiographic evaluation was used to determine the level of AVM nidus involution after the procedure.
   RESULTS: The present study identified 16 patients with ruptured high-grade AVMs of high surgical risk. All the patients had undergone immediate embolization with delayed SRS for treatment of the hemorrhage and nidus of the AVM. A statistically significant proportion of patients showed marked improvement in the modified Rankin scale scores. No subsequent repeat hemorrhage or any associated complications after embolization occurred in any patient.
   CONCLUSION: These findings warrant consideration of endovascular embolization with adjuvant SRS as a powerful treatment option for cases with high surgical morbidity due to AVM characteristics.

AB BACKGROUND: Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are minimally invasive techniques used to treat vertebral compression fractures. The etiology of vertebral compression fractures varies among patients. Although osteoporosis and trauma are major etiologic factors in patients with a vertebral compression fracture, unexpected results were found in 11 patients in the present study. The aim of the present retrospective study was to determine the incidentally detected pathology results of patients with vertebral fracture treated by vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty.
   METHODS: From February 2010 to November 2015, 616 patients with a vertebral compression fracture were treated by kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty at our institution. Vertebral biopsies were obtained from 533 patients during a vertebral augmentation technique. The average patient age was 62.4 years. Of the 616 patients, 388 were female and 228 were male. Histological evaluation of the biopsy specimens from the vertebral compression fractures was performed.
   RESULTS: The biopsy results of 505 patients showed various stages of bone healing. Among these patients, malignancy was identified in 23 patients, and 43 patients had a history of malignancy. In 6 patients, an unsuspected malignancy was found, and 1 patient had Paget's disease. Infection was detected in 4 patients. In our study, the rate of unsuspected malignancy was 1.1%.
   CONCLUSIONS: Tissue examination is useful and could reveal pathologic fractures. An incidentally detected biopsy result could change the treatment of patients; however, bone biopsy should be reserved for those patients whose preoperative radiological diagnosis raises suspicion of a nonosteoporotic etiology.

AB OBJECTIVE: Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) has been reported to actuate blood coagulation. Rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) is a dynamic hemostatic test that can differentiate various coagulation abnormalities. For example, increased coagulation activity can be detected as a wider amplitude of tracing (maximal clot firmness [MCF]). ROTEM had not been used to evaluate coagulation changes after aSAH. We evaluated the ongoing coagulation process in patients with aSAH in a prospective, observational study to compare their ROTEM assay results with the control values obtained from patients undergoing clipping of nonruptured aneurysms.
   METHODS: ROTEM analyses were performed at 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours after the onset of aSAH and compared with the preoperative analyses from the control group. A total of 17 patients with aSAH treated in the intensive care unit and 16 control patients were enrolled.
   RESULTS: At 72 hours, EXTEM-MCF was significantly greater in patients with aSAH compared with the baseline values of the control group (68.0 mm [interquartile range (IQR), 66.0-71.0] versus 64.5 mm [IQR, 59.5-66.8]; P = 0.024). This was mainly due to increased fibrin formation and fibrin polymerization. The same comparison in the FIBTEM-MCF analysis yielded similar results (aSAH group, 23.0 mm [IQR, 19.0-25.0] vs. control group, 15.4 mm [IQR, 12.5-17.8], respectively; P = 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: Blood coagulation is activated at 72 hours after aSAH onset, which can be detected by ROTEM EXTEM-MCF analysis. Also, the FIBTEM-MCF was elevated, implying that the relative contribution of fibrin formation and fibrin polymerization is essential.

AB OBJECTIVE: Piezoelectric surgery represents an innovative technique to perform safe and effective osteotomies and is an alternative to traditional bony tissue management using rotating or perforating instruments. We evaluated the safety and feasibility of craniotomies using an ultrasonic device that allows the selective cut of mineralized structures, avoiding damages to the vascular, dural, and parenchymal structures.
   METHODS: We analyzed a series of 300 patients (age range, 1-81 years; SD +/- 15.2) who underwent elective cranial surgery for brain tumors, in which the craniotomy was performed using a piezoelectric device. Pre- and postoperative imaging, clinical notes, and intraoperative details were collected.
   RESULTS: There were 197 patients (66%) who underwent surgery for supratentorial tumors; the remaining 103 patients (34%) underwent surgery for infratentorial ones. Tumors involved the skull base in 125 cases. Meningiomas, gliomas, and schwannomas represented the most common histotypes. Duraplasty for dural damages was not necessary in all cases; no venous sinuses or parenchymal injuries were reported during bone work. We noted in 13 cases (4.3%) a minor dural tear, requiring only direct sutures. Bone flaps were always intact after craniotomy. No subgaleal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collection or CSF leak was recorded. Because of the minimal bone gap, we always achieved correct bone flap ossification. No reabsorption or mobilization of bone flap was noted.
   CONCLUSIONS: We illustrate the feasibility and safety of a piezosurgical cutter to perform craniotomies. This alternative technique appears to be safe, with excellent cosmetic effects, adding another tool to the neurosurgical armamentarium.

AB OBJECTIVE: A broad armamentarium of microsurgical techniques affords flexibility to surgeons when choosing a procedure that is best tailored to fit the anatomy of an individual. Herein, we report on the feasibility of using the deep cervical artery (DCA) to revascularize the vertebral artery (VA) via a DCA-V3 bypass graft.
   METHODS: Fourteen DCAs from 7 injected cadaveric heads were located and traced. The diameter of the main trunk of the DCA was measured bilaterally at the C3 level. The proximal vertebral branches of each DCA were then severed and the main trunk of the DCA was transposed superiorly onto the V3 segment of the VA, which was also exposed bilaterally.
   RESULTS: The DCA was identified and traced bilaterally on all specimens. The diameter of the main trunk of the DCA at the C3 level ranged from 1.03 to 2.79 mm. The mean diameter of the main trunk of the DCA at this level was found to be 1.52 +/- 0.60 mm for the right side and 1.46 +/- 0.54 mm for the left side. After releasing the proximal vertebral branches of the DCA, all arteries were able to be transposed to the ipsilateral VA.
   CONCLUSIONS: Based on the mean diameter of the DCA reported in extant literature and this study, the blood flow volume of the DCA makes it a viable candidate to bypass the proximal VA.

AB BACKGROUND: Inflammatory processes play a key role in the pathophysiology of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). This study evaluated whether different temporal patterns of intrathecal and systemic inflammation could be identified in the acute phase after SAH. The intensity of the inflammation was also assessed in clinical subgroups.
   METHODS: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood samples were collected at days 1, 4, and 10 after ictus in 44 patients with severe SAH. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) was analyzed by a routine monoclonal antibody-based method. Median IL-6 values for each day were calculated. Day 4 IL-6 values were compared in dichotomized groups (age, sex, World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies [WFNS] grade, Fisher scale grade, outcome, vasospasm, central nervous system infection and systemic infections).
   RESULTS: CSF IL-6 levels were significantly elevated from day 1 to days 4 and 10, whereas plasma IL-6 showed a different trend at lower levels. Median CSF IL-6 concentrations for days 1, 4, and 10 were 876.5, 3361, and 1567 ng/L, whereas plasma was 26, 27.5, and 15.9 ng/L, respectively. No significant differences in CSF concentrations were observed between the subgroups, with the most prominent one being in day 4 IL-6 in the WFNS subgroups (grades 1-3 vs. 4-5, 1158.5 vs. 5538 ng/L; P = 0.056). Patients with systemic infection had significantly higher plasma IL-6 concentrations than patients without infection (31 vs. 16.05 ng/L, respectively; P = 0.028).
   CONCLUSIONS: Distinctly different inflammatory patterns could be seen intrathecally compared with the systemic circulation. In plasma, a significant difference in the intensity of the inflammation was seen in cases with systemic infection. No other subgroup showed statistically significant differences.

AB BACKGROUND: Endoscopic resection of colloid cysts is a widely accepted treatment option instead of microsurgery. However, there is still a debate about a potentially higher rate of incomplete resections and recurrence.
   OBJECTIVE: The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate long-term results after endoscopic removal of colloid cysts.
   METHODS: Twenty patients underwent endoscopic treatment in our department. Eighteen patients agreed to follow-up examinations. In 17 patients, magnetic resonance images were obtained.
   RESULTS: Total cyst resection was achieved in 16 procedures. In 1 patient, only plexus coagulation and widening of the ipsilateral foramen of Monro were performed. In 3 patients, small remnants of the cyst membrane were left behind. Conversion to microsurgery became necessary in 1 patient. Mild temporary complications occurred in 6 patients. Preoperative symptoms were completely relieved in 16 patients and improved in 2 patients. The average follow-up period was 188 months. In the patient with plexus coagulation, the cyst did not change. Recurrence occurred in 2 of 3 patients with cyst remnants. To date, no cyst remnant or recurrence has caused any symptoms or required surgical treatment.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that endoscopic treatment of colloid cysts is a safe and effective treatment option that provides excellent long-term results. However, we determined that a significant risk for recurrence exists when even small parts of the cyst capsule were left behind. Therefore, we advocate an attempt at total endoscopic cyst resection.

ID LONG-TERM; RECURRENCE; RISK
AB BACKGROUND: De novo aneurysm formation after completely occluded aneurysms via clipping or coiling has not been well studied. Although known to occur several years after initial aneurysm management, the natural history of de novo aneurysms is obscure. We investigated the formation of new aneurysms in patients who had previously undergone treatment of intracranial aneurysms.
   METHODS: In a retrospective, single-institutional series, eligible patients who had undergone treatment of ruptured cerebral aneurysms from 2000 to 2011 were included. The primary outcome measure was the development of de novo aneurysms during long-term follow-up.
   RESULTS: Overall, 130 patients (63% women) who had undergone microsurgical clipping (n = 63; 48.5%) or endovascular coiling (n = 67%; 51.5%) for ruptured aneurysms were included. The average follow-up time for our cohort was 10 +/- 2.7 years. De novo aneurysms occurred in 10 of 130 patients (7.7%), with a mean time of 7.9 years for aneurysm detection. No association between the formation of de novo aneurysms and the location of the treated aneurysms, smoking status, hypertension, age, or gender was found. Follow-up imaging studies were performed every 2 years. De novo aneurysms had formed in 2 patients within 2-5 years, 7 patients after 5-10 years, and 1 patient after 10 years of follow-up. In 2 of 10 patients, the de novo aneurysm had ruptured and led to subarachnoid haemorrhage.
   CONCLUSION: The rate of de novo aneurysm occurrence was 7.6%, with a mean time to development of 7.9 years. This underscores the significance of long-term monitoring of patients with intracranial aneurysms. In our series, most new aneurysms had occurred after 5 years of follow-up.

   CHEMOTHERAPY; NAVIGATION; ACCURACY
AB BACKGROUND: Placement of intraventricular catheters in oncology patients is associated with high complication rates. Placing Ommaya reservoirs with the zero-error precision protocol (ZEPP), a combination of neuronavigation (AxiEM stereotactic navigation) and direct verification of catheter tip placement with a flexible neuroendoscope, is associated with decreased complication rates as a result of increased catheter placement accuracy. However, the ZEPP costs more than traditional methods of catheter placement, and the question of whether this increased accuracy with the ZEPP is cost-effective is unknown.
   METHODS: We performed a single-center retrospective chart review of 50 consecutive ommaya reservoir patient placements between 2010 and 2017. Twenty-five ventricular catheters were placed using the ZEPP protocol, and 25 ventricular catheters were placed using only AxiEM stealth navigation. Postoperative catheter accuracy and complication rates were assessed. A cost-benefit analysis was then conducted to determine if the overall cost for placing Ommaya reservoirs with the ZEPP was effective compared with the alternative method of using neuro-navigation alone.
   RESULTS: In the non-ZEPP cohort, 10 of 25 catheters were placed within the optimal location compared with 25 of 25 catheters placed in the ZEPP cohort. Three complications occurred in the non-ZEPP cohort: 2 catheters required surgical revision and 1 catheter-related hemorrhage resulted in a prolonged stay in the intensive care unit. No complications occurred in the ZEPP cohort. A cost-benefit analysis showed $4784 savings per patient with ZEPP utilization because of the high complication-associated costs.
   CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of the ZEPP for verifying ventricular catheter placement in Ommaya reservoirs improved catheter tip accuracy, resulted in lower complication rates, and was more cost-effective when compared with the non-ZEPP cohort, which used only neuronavigation. The ZEPP can be used for ventricular shunt catheter placement to decrease complications and verify catheter tip accuracy in Ommaya or standard ventriculoperitoneal shunts.

AB BACKGROUND: We evaluated the surgical outcomes of metastatic spine hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and determined the factors that might influence the outcomes of metastatic HCC of the spine.
   METHODS: From 2010 to 2017, 72 patients with HCC-derived metastatic spine tumors were treated in our department. For each patient, we recorded the pre- and postoperative visual analog scale score, Frankel grade, perioperative complications, and mortality. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to explore a range of factors that might influence postoperative survival.
   RESULTS: The mean postoperative survival was 10.8 +/- 5.4 months. The concordance rate between a Tokuhashi score of 0-8 and a life expectancy of <6 months was only 19.2%. The mean postoperative survival for patients undergoing excisional surgery was 14.7 +/- 6.5 months, and the mean survival of those receiving palliative surgery was 8.5 +/- 2.6 months. Pain had significantly improved in both patient groups (P < 0.001). Paralysis did not change significantly in the excisional surgery group (P = 0.641) or palliative surgery group (P = 0.912). Univariate analysis showed that the preoperative Frankel score, Tomita score, Tokuhashi score, blood loss, multilevel metastases, and operative type were independent prognostic factors for postoperative survival time. Multivariate analysis showed that operation type was an independent factor for prognosis, just as were the Tomita score and Tokuhashi score.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results have challenged previously reported estimates of the life expectancy correlating with the Tokuhashi score. Our results showed that excisional surgery resulted in better clinical outcomes compared with palliative surgery.

AB OBJECTIVE: Previous studies have shown that the clivus angle gradient is significantly decreased in patients with Chiari malformation type I (CMI) with an associated syrinx compared with patients with CMI only and a healthy population. To date, the relationship between the clivus gradient and clinical outcomes has remained unclear. The objective of the present study was to investigate whether different clivus gradients (angle alpha) in CMI after posterior fossa decompression will lead to different clinical outcomes.
   METHODS: A total of 86 patients who had undergone surgical decompression at our institution from 2010 to 2016 were retrospectively divided into 2 groups: group A, with a gradient angle >44 degrees, and group B, with an angle <= 44 degrees. The patients' outcomes were determined using the Chicago Chiari Outcome Scale (CCOS).
   RESULTS: Direct comparisons were made between the 2 groups. No statistically significant differences were found between the 2 groups in demographic data, preoperative symptoms, postoperative complications, or radiographic characteristics (P > 0.05), except for the length of the postoperative hospital stay (P = 0.006). The mean overall CCOS score was 12.80 +/- 2.08. The total CCOS score was significantly different statistically between the 2 groups (P < 0.05). Moreover, group A demonstrated significantly better postoperative improvements compared with group B in the clinical outcome measures using the CCOS (P = 0.021).
   CONCLUSIONS: A direct comparison between the 2 groups revealed that a decreased clivus gradient was related to unsatisfactory clinical outcomes. Thus, clivus gradients might emerge as a predictor of clinical outcomes after surgical decompression in patients with CMI.

AB OBJECTIVE: Atlantoaxial stabilization procedures in high-riding vertebral artery (HRVA) cases are challenging. C2 translaminar screws are rigid and pose no risk to the vertebral artery. The aim of this study was to present clinical outcomes of atlantoaxial dislocation combined with HRVA using C2 translaminar screws.
   METHODS: Cases of atlantoaxial dislocation combined with HRVA surgically treated in our institution from 2007 to 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. Atlantodental interval and clivus-axial angle were measured. The Japanese Orthopaedic Association scale was used to evaluate neurologic status.
   RESULTS: There were 58 patients enrolled: 15 with instability and 43 with dislocation, 13 of which were irreducible. Incidence of bilateral HRVA was 5.2%. C1-C2 fixation was performed in 26 cases; atlantodental interval decreased from 9.9 +/- 3.7 mm to 1.0 +/- 1.7 mm (P < 0.05). C0-C2 fixation was performed in 32 cases; clivus-axial angle increased from 125 degrees +/- 13 degrees to 150 degrees +/- 15 degrees (P < 0.05). Preoperative and postoperative Japanese Orthopaedic Association scores of 56 patients with myelopathy were 11.9 +/- 2.8 and 14.6 +/- 2.4, respectively (P < 0.05). Fusion rate was 93.1% (54/58) and at 4-month follow-up was 81% (47/58). In 14 cases of redislocation, final fusion was achieved; 3 of 14 required odontoidectomy. Four cases lacking bony fusion also required revision surgery. Redislocation rate was 31% (18/58), and reoperation rate was 12.1% (7/58).
   CONCLUSIONS: Surgical results of C2 translaminar screws are unsatisfactory, with high redislocation and reoperation rates in atlantoaxial dislocation cases. New treatment methods should be investigated to facilitate clinical outcomes. Extending fixed segments should be considered.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical characteristics of delayed remission (DR) of growth hormone (GH)-secreting pituitary adenoma after transsphenoidal adenectomy and inform follow-up treatments.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 87 patients who had undergone transsphenoidal surgery for acromegaly. Demographic, radiological, and endocrinological data were reviewed before, immediately after, 3 months after, and in the long term (2.4 +/- 1.1 years) after surgery. The definition of DR was that patients did not achieve GH remission immediately, 3 months, or later after surgery, but did so in the long term without any additional postoperative treatment.
   RESULTS: Fifty-one patients (58.6%) achieved long-term GH remission. There were 24 (27.6%) DR patients immediately postoperatively and 9 (10.3%) DR patients 3 months postoperatively. On average, the 24 DR patients achieved remission at 10.2 (range, 3-32) months. Immediate postoperative random and nadir GH after an oral glucose load were significantly lower in the DR group than in the non-remission group (2.73 +/- 3.17 and 2.03 +/- 2.59 vs. 8.05 +/- 10.35 and 5.55 +/- 5.91 mu g/L, respectively). Three-month postoperative nadir GH was significantly lower in the DR group than in the nonremission group (1.63 +/- 2.82 vs. 3.48 +/- 4.25 mu g/L, P = 0.007). Immediate postoperative random GH effectively predicted long-term remission (Spearman's rho = 0.513, area under the curve = 0.905 > 0.90). However, the best predictor of long-term remission was 3-month postoperative nadir GH (Spearman's rho = 0.728, area under the curve = 0.944 > 0.90), with 76.5% sensitivity and 97.2% specificity.
   CONCLUSIONS: For certain groups of patients likely to achieve DR, additional treatments should not be performed early after surgery. Prolonged follow-up and close observation could help determine the therapeutic effect of surgery and guide postoperative treatments.

TI Comparison of Radiation Therapy Alone and Chemotherapy Alone for

ID TERM-FOLLOW-UP; BRAIN-TUMORS; RADIOTHERAPY; RISK; PROCARBAZINE;

AB BACKGROUND: The combined use of chemotherapy (CT) and radiotherapy (RT) is becoming increasingly common in the treatment of surgically resected low-grade gliomas. However, whether RT or CT is associated with improved overall survival (OS) for low-grade gliomas without surgical resection is less clear.
   METHODS: The U.S. National Cancer Data Base was used to identify patients with histologically confirmed World Health Organization (WHO) grade 2 gliomas who received either RT alone or CT alone but did not undergo surgical resection from 2004 to 2013. OS was evaluated with Kaplan-Meier analysis, multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression, and propensity score-matched analysis.
   RESULTS: In total, 1126 patients with WHO grade 2 gliomas were included, among whom 715 (63.5%) received RT alone and 411 (36.5%) CT alone. CT alone was associated with significantly longer OS when compared to RT alone on multivariable analysis and propensity-score matched analysis. Age less than 60 years and time from diagnosis to start of adjuvant therapy (RT or CT) greater than 30 days were also associated with longer OS. In subgroup analysis based on age, the survival advantage of CT alone over RT alone persisted in both age subgroups (< 60 years and >60 years). In subgroup analyses based on histology of glioma, CT alone was associated with longer OS in the astrocytoma and oligodendroglioma group, but not in the oligoastrocytoma group.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that CT alone was independently associated with longer OS when compared with RT alone in patients with low-grade glioma but without surgical resection. This survival advantage persisted in both age subgroups, but it varied by histology of glioma.

AB BACKGROUND: Tetranectin is a secreted homotrimeric protein belonging to the C-type lectin family. Our previous studies found that tetranectin was not only related to, but also played a protective role in, Parkinson disease. In this study, we aim to illustrate the molecular mechanism of the secreted tetranectin.
   METHODS: We used exogenous tetranectin to investigate the function and molecular mechanism of secreted tetranectin in a 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridine (MPP+)-induced SH-SY5Y cell model. Cell viability and reactive oxygen species were measured to assess the protective effects of tetranectin against MPPD. Apoptosis was measured in several aspects, including Bcl-2/Bax expression, caspase-3/7 activity, annexin V staining, and nuclear morphology. Autophagy was measured as LC3 expression and autophagy flux. Moreover, we used cell immunofluorescence to detect the transport of tetranectin. Western blotting was performed to measure the phosphorylation level of ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (p70S6K1), and co-immunoprecipitation was applied to confirm the interaction between tetranectin and p70S6K1.
   RESULTS: The data showed exogenous tetranectin alleviated MPPD-induced toxicity, high reactive oxygen species levels, apoptosis, and autophagy and changed the phosphorylation level of p70S6K1. Immunofluorescence images suggested exogenous tetranectin could be taken into SH-SY5Y cells, and the co-immunoprecipitation experiment indicated tetranectin interacted with p70S6K1.
   CONCLUSIONS: Exogenous tetranectin protects against MPP+-induced neurotoxicity by promoting p70S6K1 phosphorylation once taken into SH-SY5Y cells.

AB BACKGROUND: Giant cell tumor (GCT) of the spine is a benign tumor with local aggressiveness and potential for recurrence. No published study has discussed the prognostic role of preoperative D-dimer (D-D) level in spinal GCT. The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the prognostic value of preoperative plasma D-D level and clinical factors.
   METHODS: Routine clinical parameters and plasma D-D level were analyzed preoperatively. The disease-free survival (DFS) rate was estimated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Variables with P value <0.1 were subjected to multivariate analysis by Cox regression analysis. P values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.
   RESULTS: The recurrence rate of spinal GCT was 21.6% in our series. A total of 153 patients were stratified into 2 groups by preoperative D-D level of <= 0.5 mu g/mL or >0.5 mu g/mL. We found that several clinicopathologic features were associated with the D-D level, including tumor location, the segment involved, Jaffe grade, and recurrence (P < 0.05). Multivariate analysis indicated that the treatment history, resection mode, bisphosphonate treatment, and preoperative D-D level were prognostic factors of DFS (all P < 0.05). In addition, the Jaffe grading system stratified by preoperative plasma D-D level was correlated with DFS of patients with spinal GCT (P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that preoperative plasma D-D level, total spondylectomy, bisphosphonate treatment, and treatment history were powerful independent prognostic factors for DFS of patients with spinal GCT, suggesting that preoperative plasma D-D level may be a useful biomarker for predicting recurrence and prognosis of spinal GCT.

AB OBJECTIVE: Recent three-dimensional constructive interference in steady state (3D-CISS) studies have shown that the involved arteries decrease not only their own luminal caliber but also outer diameter in moyamoya disease (MMD). This study was aimed to clarify how the outer diameter of the involved arteries serially change during disease progression in MMD using qunatitaive 3D-CISS imaging.
   METHODS: This study included 8 hemispheres of 7 patients with MMD whose Suzuki angiographic stage spontaneously progressed during follow-up. Using 3D-CISS, the outer diameter was quantified serially in supraclinoid portion of internal carotid artery (C1), the horizontal portion of middle and anterior cerebral arteries (M1 and A1, respectively) before and after the spontaneous disease progression, and also 3-12 months later.
   RESULTS: In 7 hemispheres with early disease stage (stage 1-3) at initial presentation, the involved arteries decreased in their outer dimater in parallel with luminal stenosis during spontaneous disease progression in the C1 (P = 0.005), M1 (P < 0.0001), and A1 portions (P = 0.0048). In the remaining 1 hemisphere with stage 4 at initial presentation, 3D-CISS imaging showed no significant change in the outer diameter of C1, M1, and A1 segments during disease progression.
   CONCLUSIONS: Using quantitative 3D-CISS imaging, this study clearly shows that the involved arteries serially decrease in their own outer diameter in parallel with luminal stenosis during spontaneous disease progression in early stages of MMD (stage 1-3). This phenomenon has not been reported previously and may result from the pathognomic mechanisms underlying the development of MMD.

AB OBJECTIVE: To examine effects of percutaneous endoscopic debridement and allograft via the transforaminal approach combined with percutaneous pedicle screw fixation as treatment for single-level thoracic tuberculosis.
   METHODS: This multicenter retrospective analysis included 75 patients with single-level thoracic tuberculosis who underwent percutaneous endoscopic debridement and allograft via the transforaminal approach combined with percutaneous pedicle screw fixation and were followed for >36 months between January 2012 and December 2014.
   RESULTS: Follow-up was 36-48 months (average 41.1 +/- 2.2 months). Intraoperative blood loss was low (average 30.5 +/- 7.9 mL), and bed rest time was short (average 1.5 +/- 0.3 days). No recurrence was observed in all 75 patients. Except for 3 patients, almost all patients (96%) achieved grade I or II fusion in interbody bone grafting. Segmental Cobb angle was 13.5 degrees +/- 4.1 degrees before surgery, 10.5 degrees +/- 3.7 degrees immediately after surgery, and 11.7 degrees +/- 3.9 degrees at 36 months of follow-up. All patients achieved complete recovery of neurologic function (American Spinal Injury Association grade E), including 15 patients with spinal cord injury (American Spinal Injury Association grade D) before surgery. The visual analog scale and 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey scores significantly improved at 1, 3, 12, and 36 months of follow-up. No complications related to internal fixation occurred within the follow-up period; complication rate was 9.0%.
   CONCLUSIONS: Median follow-up clinical experience with percutaneous endoscopic debridement and allograft via the transforaminal approach combined with percutaneous pedicle screw fixation indicates that the technique is safe, effective, feasible, and minimally invasive.

AB BACKGROUND: The risk of hemorrhage remains after radiosurgery for patients with arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), especially during the latency period. The effect of venous outflow stenosis on postradiosurgery AVM hemorrhage has been understudied. The present study sought to clarify the effect of venous stenosis on postradiation hemorrhage.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of patients with AVM seen at our institution from 1990 to 2015. Patients who had undergone radiosurgery were included, and those without sufficient data were excluded. We performed multivariable Cox regression to evaluate the predictors of postradiosurgery hemorrhage, with specific emphasis on venous stenosis. Patients were censored from the first radiosurgery to hemorrhage or the last follow-up visit. The baseline and angiographic characteristics were compared between those with venous stenosis and those without to address potential confounders.
   RESULTS: The present study included 240 patients, of whom 29 (12.1%) had venous stenosis. The venous stenosis cohort included more patients with venous varices (P = 0.009) and fewer with deep venous drainage (P = 0.048) compared with those without venous stenosis. Most patients had grade III or higher AVMs (63.2%), with an obliteration rate of 32.9%. In an all-inclusive multivariable Cox regression, hemorrhage risk was associated with venous stenosis (hazard ratio [HR], 3.70; P = 0.034), age (HR, 1.05; P = 0.002), AVM volume (HR, 1.04; P = 0.004), and hemorrhage before treatment (HR, 4.11; P = 0.014). Male gender was protective (HR, 0.31; P = 0.036) against hemorrhage.
   CONCLUSIONS: We identified statistically significant risk factors for postradiosurgery AVM hemorrhage, which included advanced age, female gender, the presence of venous stenosis, a larger AVM volume, and previous hemorrhage. We recommend cautious selection of patients for radiosurgery with close follow-up after treatment, especially for patients with these risk factors.

AB BACKGROUND: Current standard of care for children with infratentorial ependymoma includes maximal safe resection and local radiation of 54-59 Gray. High-dose local radiation has been associated with declines in multiple cognitive domains. The anatomic and physiologic correlates of this cognitive decline remain undefined, and there have been no radiographic studies on the long-term effects of this treatment paradigm.
   METHODS: A comprehensive database of pediatric brain tumor patients treated at Stanford Children's from 2004-2016 was queried. Seven patients with posterior fossa ependymoma who were treated with surgery and local radiation alone, who had no evidence of recurrent disease, and had imaging suitable for analysis were identified. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging datasets were used to calculate apparent diffusion coefficient maps for each subject, while arterial spin labeling datasets were used to calculate maps of cerebral blood flow. Diffusion-weighted imaging and arterial spin labeling datasets of 52 age-matched healthy children were analyzed in the same fashion to enable group comparisons.
   RESULTS: Several statistically significant differences were detected between the 2 groups. Cerebral blood flow was lower in the caudate and pallidum and higher in the nucleus accumbens in the ependymoma cohort compared with controls. Apparent diffusion coefficient was increased in the thalamus and trended toward decreased in the amygdala.
   CONCLUSIONS: Surgery and local radiation for posterior fossa ependymoma are associated with supratentorial apparent diffusion coefficient and cerebral blood flow alterations, which may represent an anatomic and physiologic correlate to the previously published decline in neurocognitive outcomes in this population.

AB OBJECTIVE: Delayed hyponatremia can occur after transsphenoidal pituitary tumor surgery, resulting in unexpected readmission. Predictive factors for delayed hyponatremia after this type of surgery are not well established. In this retrospective study, predictive factors for delayed hyponatremia were investigated in patients undergoing transsphenoidal pituitary tumor surgery.
   METHODS: Preoperative data (demographics, comorbidities, and hormonal assessment), preoperative, intraoperative, and immediate postoperative sodium concentrations, the nadir sodium concentration on postoperative day (POD) 1-2, characteristics of pituitary tumor (size, cell type, optic chiasm compression, and cavernous sinus invasion), and intraoperative data (operation time and fluid balance) were retrospectively collected from 234 patients undergoing endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery for removal of nonfunctioning pituitary tumors. Delayed hyponatremia was defined as serum sodium concentration <135 mEq/L on POD 3 or later, and after discharge, postoperative sodium concentration was measured on POD 7-10.
   RESULTS: Delayed hyponatremia was observed in 53 patients (22.6%). Of these patients, 5 (9.4%) were readmitted because of delayed hyponatremia. In binary logistic regression analysis, age >60 years (odds ratio [OR], 2.22; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.16-4.26; P = 0.017), the nadir sodium concentration on POD 1-2 (OR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.77-0.99; P = 0.034), and operation time (OR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.00-1.02; P = 0.018) were independent risk factors for delayed hyponatremia after endoscopic transsphenoidal pituitary surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of delayed hyponatremia in patients with nonfunctioning pituitary tumor who underwent endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery was 22.6%. Old age, low sodium concentration on POD 1-2, and long operation time were associated with the development of delayed hyponatremia in such patients.

AB BACKGROUND: Among the proposed hypotheses for C5 palsy, the most acceptable etiologies have been the tethering effect of the spinal nerve or reperfusion injury of the spinal cord. We performed a meta-analysis to determine a potential etiology of C5 palsy.
   METHODS: The PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases were searched up to 2017 for relevant studies of the incidence of C5 palsy after cervical decompression surgery. Relevant incident estimates of C5 palsy stratified by the surgical approach and underlying diagnosis were calculated using an appropriate meta-analysis.
   RESULTS: A total of 107 studies were included for our meta-analysis. The pooled incidence of C5 palsy was 0.00 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.00-0.01) for anterior decompression in patients with radiculopathy, 0.04 (95% CI, 0.03-0.05) for anterior decompression and 0.07 (95% CI, 0.06-0.08) for posterior decompression in patients with myelopathy. A two-tailed t test with unequal variance accepted the null hypothesis of no differences in the incidence between anterior and posterior decompression in patients with myelopathy (P = 0.999) and rejected the hypothesis of no differences in the incidence between the patients with radiculopathy and myelopathy in anterior decompression (P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: With no significant difference found in the incidence of C5 palsy between anterior and posterior cervical decompression in patients with myelopathy, the tethering effect of the spinal nerve might not be a plausible etiology for C5 palsy. In contrast, we found a significantly greater incidence of C5 palsy in patients with myelopathy compared with those with radiculopathy undergoing anterior decompression, which might support the reperfusion injury of the spinal cord as the etiology of C5 palsy.

ID CEREBRAL ANEURYSM SURGERY; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; ASYMMETRY; NETWORK;
   SYSTEM
AB BACKGROUND: Monitoring of corticocortical evoked potentials (CCEPs) during brain tumor surgery of patients under anesthesia was recently reported to be effective in assisting in preservation of speech function. The aim of this study was to investigate whether CCEPs can be reproducibly measured between the frontal and temporal lobes during standard intracranial vascular surgery under general anesthesia; whether dynamic changes in CCEPs caused by reduced focal cerebral blood flow can be measured; and whether CCEPs can be used to monitor speech function, particularly associated with the left side of the brain.
   METHODS: We monitored CCEPs during 58 vascular surgeries (42 clipping procedures; 15 bypasses, 1 of which overlapped with clipping; and 2 hematoma removals from the left frontal and temporal lobe) at Kashiwaba Neurosurgical Hospital from October 2016 to January 2018.
   RESULTS: CCEPs could be reproducibly and routinely monitored in bilateral vascular surgeries. None of the patients experienced any postoperative symptoms or showed any ischemic lesions on postoperative magnetic resonance imaging; however, 5 patients temporarily demonstrated reduced CCEPs intraoperatively that were caused by transient obstructions of blood flow. Motor evoked potentials and somatosensory evoked potentials were simultaneously monitored intraoperatively and did not show any changes.
   CONCLUSIONS: The results of our pilot study show that CCEPs can be routinely monitored during bilateral intracranial vascular surgery and that they are sensitive to ischemia. CCEPs on the left side could serve as unique intraoperative monitoring of speech function under anesthesia.

AB BACKGROUND: Minimally invasive surgery using a mini-open lateral retropleural or retroperitoneal approach for corpectomy is a well-described procedure for treating unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures. Most surgeons have incorporated fluoroscopy for localization and determination of hardware placement accuracy; however, the utility of computer-assisted image-guided spinal navigation has not been well described. We report a series of mini-open lateral approach thoracolumbar corpectomy cases using either fluoroscopy or intraoperative computed tomography (iCT) with computer-assisted navigation and discuss the technical nuances and advantages of using iCT with navigation versus fluoroscopy.
   METHODS: A retrospective review and analysis was performed of the cases of 20 patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures surgically managed via mini-open lateral corpectomy with fluoroscopy (2013-2015) or iCT navigation (2015-2017). The surgical outcomes were evaluated by the estimated blood loss, operative time, hospital stay, and need for revision. The clinical outcomes were evaluated using the numerical rating scale pain score. Radiographic outcomes were assessed with follow-up CT scans. The results were statistically analyzed using the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test.
   RESULTS: The mean follow-up period was 13.4 months for the fluoroscopy group and 14.7 months for the iCT group. No surgical complications developed and no revisions were required. No statistically significant differences were found between the groups in surgical or clinical outcomes. However, the radiation exposure to the surgeons was significantly less with the iCT group (P < 0.003).
   CONCLUSIONS: The use of iCT with spinal navigation for mini-open lateral corpectomy for thoracolumbar burst fractures yields perioperative and clinical outcomes comparable to those using traditional fluoroscopy, with decreased radiation exposure to surgeons.

TI Anterior Transcorporeal Approach to Percutaneous Endoscopic Cervical
   Diskectomy for Single-Level Cervical Intervertebral Disk Herniation:
   Case Series with 2-Year Follow-Up
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article

AB OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of anterior transcorporeal percutaneous endoscopic cervical diskectomy (ATPECD) for the treatment of single-level cervical intervertebral disk herniation (CIDH) with a focus on its safety, feasibility, clinical efficacy, and specific possible complications.
   METHODS: A series of 35 patients with symptomatic single-level CIDH were enrolled to be treated with ATPECD. Neck and arm pain was measured using the visual analog scale. Quality of life was measured using the bodily pain and physical function on the SF-36. The average disk height and vertical vertebral body height were recorded. Bone healing was evaluated on the basis of postoperative computed tomography.
   RESULTS: Successful removal of the herniated disk was confirmed in all 35 cases. At 2 years, the patients showed a significant treatment effect in the visual analog scale and body pain and physical function portions of the SF-36 (1.14 +/- 0.60 vs. 7.62 +/- 0.61, 63.92 +/- 6.74 vs. 32.55 +/- 6.80, and 82.14 +/- 6.22 vs. 34.43 +/- 4.50, respectively, P < 0.01). Mean preoperative disk height was 6.79 +/- 0.37 mm, which decreased to 6.34 +/- 0.46 mm 2 years post operation (6.6% decrease). Preoperative surgical vertebral body height also decreased from preoperation (15.79 +/- 0.52 mm) to 2 years post operation (15.12 +/- 0.38 mm) (4.2% decrease). Three surgery-related complications were observed (8.6%).
   CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary clinical experience with ATPECD shows that it is safe, effective, feasible, and minimally invasive. Although it has some disadvantages, such as the need for repeated fluoroscopy, some minor complications, and nonsymptomatic disk height decreases, ATPECD can supplement minimally invasive surgeries in selected cases of CIDH.

DT Article

ID RUPTURED INTRACRANIAL ANEURYSMS; ENDOVASCULAR TREATMENT; REMNANTS;
   TRIAL; ISAT
AB BACKGROUND: Recurrent intracranial aneurysms (RAs) remain a daunting challenge for neurosurgeons. This study aimed to explore a potential optimal management strategy of RAs by reviewing the characteristics and management outcomes of 117 RAs.
   METHODS: A total of 117 patients with RAs were treated in a single neurosurgical center from January 2011 to January 2017. The demographic and angiographic characteristics of the patients, treatment approaches, and follow-up outcomes were evaluated.
   RESULTS: Of the 117 patients with RAs, 16 (13.7%) and 101 (86.3%) initially underwent microsurgical clipping and endovascular coiling, respectively. Coil embolization was used in 75 cases, microsurgical clipping was used in 32 cases, and conservative treatment occurred in 10 cases. Complete clipping was achieved in all 32 aneurysms by microsurgery, and remnants were observed in 25 aneurysms after coiling (33.3%, P < 0.001). Operation-related cerebral infarction occurred in 4 cases (12.5%) with complex and large RA in the clipping group and in 1.3% (1/75) of patients treated with coiling (P = 0.027). Follow-up found similar favorable outcomes in patients after coiling, clipping, and conservative treatment (90.3% vs. 86.7% vs. 80%, respectively; P = 0.711). Follow-up rates of recurrence were significantly higher in the coiling group than the clipping group (26% vs. 0%, respectively; P = 0.003).
   CONCLUSIONS: The follow-up outcomes appeared to be acceptable and comparable between the 2 groups. However, in large or giant recurrent aneurysms, sound judgment and the careful selection of treatment are strongly suggested because direct microsurgery has a higher morbidity, even in experienced hands, whereas endovascular coiling is complicated with a higher incomplete occlusion rate.

DT Article
DE Computed tomography angiography; Magnetic resonance imaging; Moyamoya
   disease; Perfusion imaging; Revascularization; Territory arterial spin

AB OBJECTIVE: To use territory arterial spin labeling (T-ASL) in the early postoperative period to evaluate the revascularization area (RA) obtained by superficial temporal artery-to-middle cerebral artery bypass and to evaluate subsequent perfusion territory changes of the major cerebral arteries.
   METHODS: Thirty patients with moyamoya disease treated via unilateral superficial temporal artery-to-middle cerebral artery bypass were included. T-ASL was performed preoperatively and within 1 week postoperatively. The RA was examined by labeling the superficial temporal artery-to-middle cerebral artery bypass postoperatively. Preoperative and postoperative perfusion territories of the bilateral internal carotid arteries, bilateral external carotid arteries, and basilar artery were also examined and compared. Postoperative computed tomography angiography was performed and compared with T-ASL results.
   RESULTS: In 14 of 30 patients (46.7%), T-ASL demonstrated the presence of an RA (RA-positive), whereas 16 patients (53.3%) had no RA (RA-negative). In the RA-positive group, mean volume of the RA was 80.32 +/- 8.13 mL (range, 34.95-142.50 mL). Postoperative perfusion territory changes of the major cerebral arteries differed between the RA-positive group and the RA-negative group. The incidence of preoperative external carotid artery compensation was significantly higher in the RA-negative group than the RA-positive group (F = 0.011, df = 1, P < 0.05). There was good intermodality agreement between T-ASL and computed tomography angiography (kappa = 0.780).
   CONCLUSIONS: T-ASL can demonstrate the RA obtained by direct revascularization and postoperative perfusion territory changes of the major cerebral arteries. T-ASL is a promising technique in postoperative evaluation of patients with moyamoya disease.

   FLUID; COMPLICATIONS; MANAGEMENT; MORTALITY
AB BACKGROUND: Colloid transfusion during surgical decompressive hemicraniectomy (DHC) to treat space-occupying cerebral infarction induced by middle cerebral artery (MCA) is controversial. A multicenter retrospective study was conducted to determine whether an increased colloid transfusion during surgery is associated with a lower incidence of postoperative pneumonia and better long-term outcomes after space-occupying cerebral infarction.
   METHODS: Data from surgical DHC within 48 hours to treat space-occupying cerebral infarction that took place between November 30, 2013, and March 30, 2016, were collected in a multicenter chart. Univariate analysis, Spearman correlation, chi(2) test, and bivariate and multivariate logistic regression were performed to account for the associations between colloid transfusion and post-operative pneumonia or long-term outcomes (indicated by modified Rankin Scale [mRS] scores).
   RESULTS: Univariate analysis showed that surgical duration and mRS were significantly different between the subjects older and younger than 60 years who underwent surgical DHC (P < 0.05). In the entire population studied, increased National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale was associated with a greater incidence of postoperative pneumonia (odds ratio [OR] 1.255, P = 0.003) and increased mRS (OR 1.229, P = 0.014). In the population older than 60 years, it was revealed that increased colloid transfusion was associated with a lower incidence of postoperative pneumonia (OR 0.761, P = 0.030) or better outcomes, as indicated with lower mRS (OR 0.837, P = 0.045).
   CONCLUSIONS: Our retrospective study demonstrated that there is a robust association between increased perioperative colloid transfusion and lower incidence of postoperative pneumonia and better outcomes among the patients older than 60 years after space-occupying cerebral infarction.

AB OBJECTIVE: The compression of the offending vessel on the facial nerve at root exit zone is considered as the leading cause of hemifacial spasm (HFS). However, the correlation between the severity of spasm and the pressure of neurovascular compression (NVC) has not yet been investigated. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical correlation between the severity of HFS and the pressure of NVC.
   METHODS: A prospective study was performed, which included 52 of 151 patients who underwent microvascular decompression. We classified the preoperative spasm severity according to the Cohen scores. Codman intracranial pressure monitoring system was used to measure the NVC pressure at the root exit zone during microvascular decompression. All patients were followed up for 12-24 months.
   RESULTS: Herein, the intraoperative pressure readings of NVC were in the range of 21-63 mmHg. The means of the pressure of NVC that corresponded to the Cohen scores (1-4) were 23.00 +/- 1.83, 34.91 +/- 12.42, 46.50 +/- 9.40, and 55.40 +/- 3.03 mmHg, respectively. The Spearman's rank correlation established a strong positive correlation between the pressure and the Cohen scores (r = 0.689, P < 0.0001). The simple linear analysis indicated that sex (P = 0.132), duration (P = 0.304), and delayed relief (P = 0.158) were not significantly associated with the pressure. However, a substantial correlation was determined between the pressure values and the time until the complete recovery (r = 0.949, P < 0.0001) of the delayed healing population.
   CONCLUSIONS: The severity of HFS exhibited a strong positive correlation with the intraoperative offending vessel's pressure values. Thus, the neurovascular pressure is a significant factor in the pathogenesis of HFS.

AB BACKGROUND: Sellar germ cell tumors (GCTs) occur more frequently in childhood. Some will present as malignancy with infiltration and metastasis. However, the association between the timeliness of diagnosis and outcome has been controversial. We investigated the clinical risk factors associated with a diagnostic delay in patients with sellar GCTs in China.
   METHODS: The data from 53 patients aged <18 years with histologically confirmed sellar GCTs at Peking Union Medical College Hospital treated from January 2008 to December 2016 were reviewed retrospectively.
   RESULTS: The median interval between symptom onset and diagnosis was 25 months. Of the 53 patients, 44 (83%) had a delayed diagnosis. Most patients (86%) with a delayed diagnosis presented with polyuria or polydipsia. Of the 53 patients, 48 (91%) exhibited changes in the pituitary stalk. Patients with a germinoma (odds ratio, 4.1; 95% confidence interval, 2.4-6.9) and slow growth (odds ratio, 5.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-24.5) were more likely to have a delayed diagnosis. The overwhelming majority of patients with a delayed diagnosis (96%) had been seen by >1 doctor. No statistically significant differences were found in the mean survival time (P = 0.21) or mean progression-free survival time (P = 0.36) between patients with and without delay in diagnosis, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: A significant proportion of patients with sellar GCTs will experience a delay in the time to diagnosis. Although a delay in diagnosis did not reduce the survival time or progression-free survival time for patients with sellar GCTs, it might increase the risk of short stature. Thus, a detailed medical history and an immediate radiological examination are important for the early diagnosis of sellar GCTs in childhood.

   intermediate nucleus
ID DEEP-BRAIN-STIMULATION; GLOBUS-PALLIDUS; PATIENT; NUCLEUS
AB BACKGROUND: Myoclonic dystonia syndrome (MDS) is a rare inherited movement disorder characterized by the coexistence of myoclonic jerks and dystonia. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a promising treatment for patients with MDS that targets the globus pallidus internus or ventral intermediate nucleus (Vim) of the thalamus. However, there are few studies regarding the long-term effects of Vim DBS in patients with MDS and even fewer in those without gene mutations.
   METHODS: Two positive and three negative SGCE mutation patients presenting with predominant myoclonus underwent Vim DBS. The Unified Myoclonus Rating Scale and the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale (BFMDRS) were assessed pre- and postoperation.
   RESULTS: Over an average follow-up period of 50 months, the myoclonus improvement rate was 92.7%. The average improvement in the BFMDRS motor score was 71.4% and the average improvement in the BFMDRS disabling score was 75.8%.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that Vim DBS can be a safe and effective treatment option for patients with MDS. Vim DBS alone may be preferable for patients with myoclonus-dominated MDS regardless of the identification of an SGCE mutation. Additional globus pallidus internus DBS may be used for progressive dystonia after Vim DBS.

AB BACKGROUND: Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) and cellular schwannomas (CSs) of the eighth cranial nerve are exceedingly rare. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate clinical and genetic characterization of these rare tumors.
   METHODS: The clinical and radiological features were analyzed retrospectively. The histopathological characteristics were assessed by hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemistry. Genomic abnormalities were evaluated using array comparative genomic hybridization.
   RESULTS: Of the 1287 surgeries for vestibular schwannomas from 2014 to 2017, 2 were for MPNSTs and 5 were for CSs. The mean age at diagnosis was older for patients with MPNSTs (57.0 +/- 4.2 years) than that of patients with CS (35.8 +/- 9.4 years; P = 0.03). Two patients with MPNST died of tumor recurrence. None of the patients with CS died. The 2-year overall and progression-free survival of patients with MPNSTs were worse than those for patients with CSs (overall survival, 50.0% +/- 35.4% vs. 100%, P = 0.027; progression-free survival, 0% vs. 100%; P = 0.012). The Ki67 index for the MPNSTs (29.0% +/- 3.5%) was greater than that for the CSs (10.3% +/- 3.1%; P = 0.001). The common alterations in MPNSTs mainly included gains of chromosomes 7p, 8p, 9q, 12, and 17 and loss of heterozygosity of 1p, 6 and 9p. The common alterations in CSs included gain of 4p16.3, loss of heterozygosity of 2p15-14, and 22q11.1-13.3.
   CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first high-resolution genomic analysis of MPNSTs and CSs of the eighth cranial nerve and has shown a significant difference that might be more accurate to distinguish between these 2 types of rare tumors.

TI Down-Regulation of Mir-145 Improves Learning and Memory Abilities in
   Epileptic Rats by Regulating Hippocampal Neuron Apoptosis
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Apoptosis; Caspase-9; Epilepsy; Learning and memory abilities; miR-45
ID CASPASE-9
AB OBJECTIVES: To investigate effect of miR-145 on learning and memory ability in rats with epilepsy.
   METHODS: Rats with epilepsy were induced by lithium chloride-pilocarpine. miR-145 antagomir and antagomir-control were injected into epileptic brains by the stereotactic technique, respectively. Then, rats were divided into a normal group (N), epilepsy group (Ep), miR-145 antagomir group (A) and antagomir-control group (C). After 1 and 7 days of treatment, the expression of miR-145 and Caspase-9 were detected, and the apoptosis of hippocampal neurons in CA1 of hippocampus was detected. After 7 days of treatment, the learning and memory abilities of rats was measured by using the Morris water maze test.
   RESULTS: The rat epilepsy model was successfully constructed. Compared with the N group, the target quadrant time and platform crossing times were reduced and the expression of miR-145 and Caspase-9 was increased in the epilepsy groups (P < 0.05). Compared with the Ep and C groups, the target quadrant time and platform crossing times were increased and the expression of miR-145 and Caspase-9 was down-regulated in the A group (P < 0.05). The number of apoptotic hippocampal neurons in the hippocampal CAl area of the Ep group was more than that in the N group and in the A group was less than that in the C group at 1 and 7 days after modeling respectively (P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: Down-regulated miR-145 improved the apoptosis of hippocampal neurons by reducing the Caspase-9 expression in hippocampus and further affected learning and memory abilities of rats with epilepsy.

AB OBJECTIVE: The contralateral interhemispheric transprecuneus approach (CITP) and the supracerebellar transtentorial transcollateral sulcus approach (STTC) are 2 novel approaches to access the atrium of the lateral ventricle. We quantitatively compared the 2 approaches.
   METHODS: Both approaches were performed in 6 sides of fixed and color-injected cadaver heads. We predefined the 6 targets in the atrium for measurement and standardization of the approaches. Using a navigation system, we quantitatively measured the working distance, cortical transgression, angle of attack, area of exposure, and surgical freedom.
   RESULTS: The distances from the craniotomy edge to the posterior pole of the choroid plexus of the CITP (mean +/- standard deviation, 67 +/- 5.3 mm) and STTC (mean, 57 +/- 4.0 mm) differed significantly (P < 0.01). Cortical transgression with the CITP (mean, 27 +/- 2.8 mm) was significantly greater than that with the STTC (mean, 21 +/- 6.7 mm; P = 0.03). The CITP showed a significantly wider rostrocaudal angle of attack than that with the STTC (P = 0.01). The STTC showed a significantly wider mediolateral angle (P < 0.01). No significant difference was found for surgical freedom of any target except for point E, for which the CITP was larger. The exposure area did not differ significantly between the 2 approaches (P = 0.07).
   CONCLUSIONS: Both approaches were feasible for accessing the atrium. The STTC provided a shorter working distance and wider mediolateral angle, CITP provided a wider rostrocaudal angle of attack and better exposure and maneuverability to the anterior and superior atrium. In contrast, the STTC was more favorable for the inferior and posterior regions.

ID SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE; BRAIN; GROWTH; MANAGEMENT; SCHWANNOMA; FLOW; CT
AB OBJECTIVE: We tested the hypothesis that cerebellopontine angle (CPA) tumors are associated with a greater incidence of unruptured intracranial aneurysms (IAs).
   METHODS: Patients with intracranial tumors (ITs) undergoing computed tomography angiography and magnetic resonance imaging were enrolled in an observational cohort study that prospectively collected age, sex, hypertension, diabetes, cerebral arteriosclerosis, tumor type, tumor location, hydrocephalus, smoking, alcohol intake, CPA tumor size, cerebral aneurysms, and cerebral arteriosclerosis. Patients with the coexistence of IA and IT were classified as group II, whereas the others with IT as group I.
   RESULTS: We included 1218 patients with IT for analysis. The incidence of IA was 7.1% (86/1218). A total of 31% of patients with aneurysms had CPA tumors. In a multivariate logistic regression model, a greater incidence of IA was found in female patients (odds ratio [OR] 1.726, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.050-2.836, P = 0.031) and in patients with CPA tumors (OR 3.002, 95% CI 1.822-4.947, P = 0.000) after adjustment for tumor type, cerebral arteriosclerosis, and age. In female patients, CPA tumors were a unique independent risk factor of a greater incidence of IA (OR 2.270, 95% CI 1.194-4.317, P = 0.012). Furthermore, cerebral arteriosclerosis was a unique independent risk factor of IA in patients with CPA tumors (OR 7.626, 95% CI 2.928-19.860, P = 0.000).
   CONCLUSIONS: These data support the hypothesis that CPA tumors are associated with a greater incidence of unruptured IAs, especially in female patients. Cerebral arteriosclerosis contributed to elevated risk of IA in patients with CPA tumors.

AB OBJECTIVE: The role of adjuvant radiotherapy (ART) in patients with World Health Organization Grade II atypical meningiomas (AMs) remains controversial.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 149 patients with newly diagnosed resected AMs from 2000 to 2012. Gross total resection (GTR) was defined as Simpson Grades I-III and subtotal resection (STR) as Grades IV and V. Kaplan-Meier analyses of local control (LC), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival were performed with the log-rank test, and risk factors for progression/recurrence (P/R) were analyzed with multivariate Cox regression.
   RESULTS: Median follow-up was 74.2 months. GTR was achieved in 98 patients and STR in 51 patients. Fifty-three (35%) patients received ART. Overall, 46 patients (31%) experienced P/R with a median time to P/R of 32.4 months. ART was associated with a trend toward improved PFS (P = 0.0669) in the GTR subset but significantly improved LC (P = 0.0183) and PFS (P = 0.0034) in the STR subset. Age, tumor size, and STR were significant risk factors for worse PFS, whereas receiving ART was associated with improved PFS on multivariate analyses. Thirty-nine of the 46 progressive/recurrent patients underwent salvage therapy with only 22 patients experiencing long-term control. Five patients experienced transformation to World Health Organization Grade III malignant meningioma.
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients who undergo STR for newly diagnosed AM should receive ART based on improvements in LC and PFS. GTR patients should be considered for ART, but active surveillance is a reasonable management approach with the recognition that progressive/recurrent disease can act aggressively. Prospective, randomized trials are currently underway to evaluate the role of ART.

ID SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE
AB BACKGROUND: Craniocervical junction dural arteriovenous fistulas (CJDAVFs) are rare vascular malformations with unclear clinical characteristics. This study investigated the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with CJDAVFs.
   METHODS: Thirty-eight patients with CJDAVFs who had undergone either conservative or surgical treatment were retrospectively analyzed.
   RESULTS: Eleven (28.9%) patients were women and 27 (71.1%) were men (median age, 52.5 years). Two (5.3%) had myelopathy, and 36 (94.7%) had subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Three patients had SAH recurrence before treatment. Five patients (13.9%) with SAH initially had negative results on angiography, which may have been due to a low-flow fistula without varicose veins (P = 0.034) and acute hydrocephalus (P = 0.084). Coincidental vascular lesions were noted in 5 patients (13.2%). Caudal drainage was mainly found in patients with myelopathy, whereas superolateral drainage was frequently observed in patients with SAH (P = 0.021). Thirty-six (94.7%) patients underwent microsurgery; of these, 33 (91.7%) had favorable outcomes and 3 (8.3%) had unfavorable outcomes. The main neurosurgical complications included acute hydrocephalus in 4 (10.5%) and new-onset mild persistent myelopathy in 6 (15.7%). According to the univariate analysis, the presence of myelopathy predicted poor outcomes, whereas SAH predicted favorable outcomes (P = 0.004). However, the multivariate analysis did not show statistical significance.
   CONCLUSIONS: SAH is a common presenting sign of CJDAVF that may be overlooked on initial cerebral angiography, especially in patients with acute hydrocephalus and a low-flow fistula without varicose veins. Microsurgery involving disconnecting the draining vein is effective and beneficial. Further studies should be performed to investigate predictive factors influencing the prognosis.

   Hydrocephalus; Intraventricular; Iohexol; Septum pellucidum;

AB OBJECTIVE: Patients with hydrocephalus secondary to third ventricular colloid cysts can require bilateral external ventricular drain (EVD) placement while awaiting surgery. However, some patients could develop auto-fenestration of the septum pellucidum (AFSP) and only require 1 EVD. We evaluated our experience with bedside iohexol ventriculography and staged EVD placement for patients with obstructive hydrocephalus.
   METHODS: We retrospectively identified 34 patients who had been treated for third ventricular colloid cysts (2013-2016). The preoperative and postoperative data, including age, sex, colloid cyst size, preoperative hydrocephalus, preoperative EVD placement, preoperative iohexol ventriculography, operative approach, intraoperative findings, and postoperative ventriculoperitoneal shunt requirements, were reviewed.
   RESULTS: Hydrocephalus was found in 23 patients (68%) on initial presentation. Nine patients (26%) had EVDs placed before surgery. Six patients (18%) underwent iohexol ventriculography after insertion of a right-sided EVD. Five patients (15%) demonstrated no evidence of ventricular communication. Four patients (67%) required left-sided EVD placement. One patient (17%) had robust communication between the lateral ventricles after intraventricular iohexol injection, which was managed with a single EVD. AFSP was observed during surgical resection of this patient's colloid cyst. One other patient who did not undergo preoperative EVD placement was noted to have AFSP intraoperatively, resulting in 2 of 34 patients (6%) with AFSP in our series.
   CONCLUSIONS: A subset of patients with obstruction at the foramina of Monro can develop AFSP. Iohexol ventriculography after unilateral EVD placement allows clinicians to assess for the presence of AFSP and identify patients who can be treated with a single EVD before surgery.

ID FIBROMYALGIA; VALIDITY; PERFORMANCE
AB BACKGROUND: We investigated a simple, novel diagnostic test for detecting incomplete effort during the motor portion of the neurological examination.
   METHODS: The results from the honest palm sign (HPS) were evaluated for 162 consecutive neuro-oncology patients who had undergone upper extremity strength testing. Deltoid, bicep, and wrist extensor strength was assessed in all patients. During the examination, patients were repeatedly encouraged to "try as hard as possible" and to "resist with all your strength." The absence of nail prints on the palms constituted a positive HPS test result (i.e., indicative of incomplete effort). The presence of nail prints constituted a negative HPS test result (i.e., indicative of full effort).
   RESULTS: A total of 162 patients were tested. Their mean age was 55.5 +/- 14.9 years, the median Karnofsky performance scale score was 80 (range, 60-100), and 63 patients (39%) were men. Of the 162 patients, 102 (63%) had malignant gliomas, 28 (17%) had brain metastases, 21 (13%) had other primary brain tumors, and 11 (6.8%) had primary central nervous system lymphomas. Of the 162 patients, 48 (30%) had positive HPS test results. The test sensitivity (84.6%), specificity (75.2%), positive likelihood ratio (3.41), and negative likelihood ratio (0.205) were good. After excluding 33 patients with characteristics that rendered them unsuitable for testing, the results from the remaining 129 patients were analyzed. The sensitivity was unchanged (84.6%), but the specificity (96.6%), positive likelihood ratio (24.5), and negative likelihood ratio (0.16) improved dramatically.
   CONCLUSIONS: The HPS test is a simple, sensitive, and very specific test for detecting incomplete effort during the motor portion of neurological evaluations.

AB OBJECTIVE: We explored the factors affecting the surgical outcomes of Hirayama disease (HD).
   METHODS: We enrolled 40 patients with a diagnosis of HD in the present study. Cervical spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed before surgery with the neck in the cervical neutral and flexion positions. Fusion surgery was performed at the most severely compressed 2 levels according to the flexion sagittal MRI findings. The patients were divided into improvement and no-improvement groups according to Odom's scale 6 months after surgery. The axial MRI parameters in the neutral and flexion positions at the most severely compressed segment were measured. P values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
   RESULTS: The average age was 18.4 +/- 2.27 years, and the average disease duration was 1.8 +/- 1.2 years. The main symptomatic side of HD statistically matched the atrophied side of the spinal cord (P < 0.001). Based on the pathophysiology of spinal cord flattening with flexion, the parameters indicating atrophy of the spinal cord and the ability of the spinal cord to recover from flattening were significantly larger in the improvement group (P < 0.05). Receiver operating characteristic curves showed good prognostic capacity for these parameters (P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: The main side of the symptoms in patients with HD corresponded with ipsilateral spinal cord atrophy found on MRI. Also, atrophy of the spinal cord in the neutral position MRI study and the ability of the spinal cord to recover were significantly related to the surgical outcome. These factors might be used as potential indications for surgery of HD.

AB BACKGROUNG: Adult spinal deformity (ASD) operations are complex and often require a multisurgeon team. Simultaneously, it is the responsibility of academic spine surgeons to train future complex spine surgeons. Our objective was to assess the effect of resident and fellow involvement (RFI) on ASD surgery in 4 areas: 1) perioperative outcomes, 2) length of stay (LOS), 3) discharge status, and 4) complications.
   METHODS: Adults undergoing thoracolumbar spinal deformity correction from 2008 to 2014 were identified in the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database. Cases were divided into those with RFI and those with attendings only. Outcomes were operative time, transfusions, LOS, discharge status, and complications. Univariate and multivariable regression modeling was used. Covariates included preoperative comorbidities, specialty, and levels undergoing instrumentation.
   RESULTS: A total of 1471 patients underwent ASD surgery with RFI in 784 operations (53%). After multivariable regression modeling, RFI was independently associated with longer operations (beta = 66.01 minutes; 95% confidence interval [CI], 35.8296.19; P < 0.001), increased odds of transfusion (odds ratio, 2.80; 95% CI, 1.814.32; P < 0.001), longer hospital stay (beta = 1.76 days; 95% CI, 0.183.34; P = 0.030), and discharge to an inpatient rehabilitation or a skilled nursing facility (odds ratio, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.343.05; P < 0.001). However, RFI was not associated with any increase in major or minor complications.
   CONCLUSION: RFI in ASD surgery was associated with increased operative time, the need for additional transfusions, longer LOS, and nonhome discharge. However, no increase in major, minor, or severe complications occurred. These data support the continued training of future deformity and complex spine surgeons without fear of worsening complications; however, areas of improvement exist.

AB This study investigates the effect of project-level collaboration breadth (i.e., the number of collaboration partner types) and collaboration depth (i.e., the intensity of the interactions with these partners) on the incremental and radical innovation performance of innovation projects. The econometric analyses, based on a Community Innovation Study sample of 218 innovation projects conducted in German manufacturing companies, reveal inverted U-shaped relationships between collaboration breadth and radical innovation performance and between collaboration depth and incremental innovation performance. These curvilinear effects speak to the high sensitivity of innovation projects to the extent of collaborative activity, which implies that practitioners should exert caution in managing collaborative innovation projects. This study contributes to the understanding of project-level open innovation and to the overall understanding of the performance effects of innovation collaboration, which, following recent assertions in the literature, could be flawed by analyses conducted at the organizational level.

AB How do intellectual propriety rights (IPRs) help firms profit from their innovation? Innovation literature frequently turns to patents to measure innovative IPR, but more recent work shifts focus to the other side of IPR, namely, trademarks. This article therefore discusses the effects of trademark strategies when companies decide to introduce their product portfolios in a new foreign market. Entrants might opt for a common trademark across different country markets (integration) or use several country-specific trademarks (responsiveness). This empirical study exploits the quasi-natural experiment created by the tariff shock that affected Spain when it joined the European Union in the 1990s. Data from the automotive industry reveal how non-European companies that already operated in other European countries sought to enter Spain rapidly, using various trademark strategies. The product portfolio characteristics are fixed at entry, so this study can specify how and when trademark responsiveness versus integration affects firm performance. The results reveal that trademark responsiveness increases firm performance if the firms suffer high liabilities of foreignness or newness.

AB This paper draws on Stokes' (1997) framework to position the disconnection between theory and practice as a knowledge production problem. In this sense, we argue that a better understanding of different academic profiles is extremely important to focus efforts on those academics that may overcome the 'lost before translation' problem. Our data, that come from a survey of researchers affiliated to the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC), provide a good opportunity to explore the factors that might increase or impede the likelihood that researchers engage in research that reconciles the quest for fundamental understanding with the consideration of use (Pasteur's profile), rather than in research complying with fundamental understanding, but not with the consideration of use (Bohr's profile). The descriptive and bivariate analyses reveal that the largest proportion of the researchers belongs to Bohr's profile. The econometric exercise enables to identify several motives that might increase or decrease the likelihood that researchers belong to Pasteur's profile instead of Bohr's profile, notably the lack of fit between researchers and non-academic agents, their motivation for learning in the context of application, having access to in-kind resources, and to a lesser extent, motives linked to career promotion imperatives and personal income. The results of the paper are also discussed to derive policy and managerial implications for research institutions.

AB Do firms in the same sector converge towards the same R&D intensities? Previous research has often assumed this to be true. A closer examination, using microdata from the EU Industrial R&D Investment Scoreboard for the years 2000-2015, shows considerable heterogeneity in R&D intensities among firms in the same sector, and that this heterogeneity persists over time. Statistical tests of convergence show that the variation in R&D intensities does not decrease over time (i.e. no sigma-convergence), although firms with an R&D intensity below the industry average do seem to catch up with the leaders (i.e. evidence of beta-convergence). Overall, firms in the same industry do not converge to a common R&D intensity. Policy implications are discussed.

AB Collaboration in large-scale projects introduces challenges involving both coordination (the ability to collaborate) as well as cooperation (the willingness to do so). Existing research has shown how modular designs can improve coordination by locating interdependencies within rather than between different modules. Based on an in-depth case study of collaboration in a large-scale infrastructure project, our study highlights an effect of modularity on collaboration that previously has been overlooked. Specifically, we show that while modular designs may help overcome coordination challenges by reducing interdependencies between modules, they can in turn hamper collaboration by emphasizing specialization within modules. Therefore, though existing work typically perceives modularity and integration as opposites, we clarify how they can also act as complements. In particular, we show how firms need to complement modular designs with integrating practices that stimulate cooperation. Overall, we contribute to the literature on collaboration and modularity by explaining when and how organizations can combine modularity and integration.

AB We investigate how often replication studies are published in empirical economics and what types of journal articles are replicated. We find that between 1974 and 2014 0.1% of publications in the top 50 economics journals were replication studies. We consider the results of published formal replication studies (whether they are negating or reinforcing) and their extent: Narrow replication studies are typically devoted to mere replication of prior work, while scientific replication studies provide a broader analysis. We find evidence that higher-impact articles and articles by authors from leading institutions are more likely to be replicated, whereas the replication probability is lower for articles that appeared in top 5 economics journals. Our analysis also suggests that mandatory data disclosure policies may have a positive effect on the incidence of replication.

AB "The important thing is not to win, it is to take part," this famous saying by Pierre de Coubertin asserts that the value athletes draw from Olympic games lies in their participation in the event and not in the gold they collect during it. We find similar evidence for scientists involved in grant competitions. Relying on unique data from a Swiss funding program, we find that scientists taking part in a research grant competition boost their number of publications and average impact factor while extending their knowledge base and their collaboration network regardless of the result of the competition. Receiving the funds increases the probability of co-authoring with co-applicants but has no additional impact on the individual productivity.

AB We investigate in the context of crowdsourcing how seekers can increase open innovation performance, measured as received solver attention, by making two strategic decisions: selecting innovation tasks that are well suited for crowdsourcing and choosing between the potentials of status signalling through identity disclosure versus enjoying the benefits of anonymity. Drawing on uncertainty reduction theory, we suggest that a well articulated problem statement reduces uncertainties of potential solvers and increases their willingness to participate. We argue that the ability of seekers to draft high-quality problem statements depends on the distance between the problem domain and their current knowledge stock. An analysis of 637 crowdsourcing projects finds that problem-seeker knowledge distance and received solver attention are curvilinear related such that moderate levels of knowledge distance maximize solver participation. However, high-status seekers who engage in identity-based status signalling are able to benefit from crowdsourcing across all levels of problem-seeker knowledge distance.

ID MATCHING ESTIMATORS
AB We investigate the effect of Europe's largest multilateral subsidy program for R&D-performing small and medium-sized enterprises. The program applied a specific budget allocation rule, referred to as Virtual Common Pot (VCP), which is designed to avoid cross-subsidization between participating countries. This rule creates exogenous variation in funding status and allows us to identify the causal effect of public R&D grants on firm growth. In addition, we compare the program's effect under the VCP rule with the standard situation of a Real Common Pot (RCP), in which program authorities allocate a single budget according to uniform project evaluation criteria. Our estimates suggest that R&D grants had no average effect on job creation and sales growth, but treatment effects were heterogeneous and positive for high-quality projects. Under an RCP the program would have created 53% more jobs and 48% higher sales.

AB This paper presents a North-South technology gap model which combines the Schumpeterian approach to technical and structural change with the Keynesian perspective on effective demand and the Balance-of Payments (BOP) constraint as drivers of growth. Three are the contributions of the paper. First, it develops a model in which the technology gap, relative productivity and relative wages co-evolve and may generate different paths of convergence or divergence between South and North depending on the parameters of the model. Second, the parameters of the model are associated with different types of policies, which allows for discussing how these policies may change the growth path. Finally, the model is used to discuss the contrasting experiences of Asia and Latin America since 1970. Convergence in Asia and divergence in Latin America have been extensively debated topics in the literature on comparative economic development, which highlights the crucial role of industrial policy. It is argued that the results of the technology gap model are consistent with the findings of this literature and helps understand the forces behind convergence and divergence.

The distribution of technology classes is more concentrated than would occur under random matching and F-tests reject the hypothesis that family size and claim scope are randomly distributed across examiners. Using the application text, we show that examiner specialization persists even after conditioning on technology sub-classes. Specialization is less pronounced in computers and software than other technology fields. More specialized examiners have a lower grant rate. These findings undermine the idea that random matching justifies instrumental variables based on examiner behaviors or characteristics.

AB International research collaboration (IRC) has been increasingly important as an emerging area of innovation studies. This study reviews the intellectual base, main research trajectories and intellectual communities of the IRC research domain over the period 1957-2015. It integrates qualitative review and three quantitative analyses including co-citation network analysis, main path analysis and bibliographic coupling analysis. The results show that the IRC research has gone through three phases, namely, "emergence" (1957-1991), "fermentation" (1992-2005) and "take-off" (2006-2015) phases. The co-citation network analysis confirms that the IRC research field has been developed under the influence of two pioneering studies related to bibliometrics research. The main research trajectories in IRC studies over the three development phases and over the whole period are identified based on the main path analysis, which shows that co-authorship analysis is the main research method in IRC studies. A bibliographic coupling analysis suggests that the whole IRC research domain can be classified into five distinct intellectual areas: drivers of IRC, IRC patterns, IRC effects, IRC networks and IRC measurement. Seven topics for future research are also identified.

AB The importance of innovation in healthcare has increased within the last decades as challenges, like rising costs and an aging demographic, have to be solved. The degree of innovativeness in healthcare is strongly influenced by the National Health Innovation System, which as a sectoral innovation system encompasses a wide variety of actors and related knowledge. Despite the highly practical relevance of the topic, there are only a few studies that analyze innovation in healthcare on a national level. Thus, this study is a starting point and, building on the theoretical framework of national innovation systems, answers the following questions: "Can countries be grouped by their innovation output in healthcare and do those groups differ in factors describing the healthcare system? Do countries with strong national innovation systems also have strong national health innovation systems and vice versa?" We compare the healthcare innovation output of 30 OECD countries using a multi indicator approach and categorize them into four distinct groups using cluster analysis. The cluster consisting of the Scandinavian countries, the Netherlands and Switzerland shows the highest innovation output measured in knowledge production and knowledge commercialization. Surprisingly, these countries, with the exception of Switzerland, only rank in the medium group when considering the entire national innovation system. Policymakers and researchers might be particularly interested in studying the healthcare systems of these countries.

AB Integrating knowledge across a firm's value chain (e.g. between R&D, marketing and manufacturing functions), which we denote "Knowledge Integration" (KI), has been consistently found to be a strong predictor of product innovation performance in the management literature. Such cross-functional integration does not occur by chance, but by design, as a result of managerial practices and organizational arrangements. The significant heterogeneity characterizing the diffusion of cross-functional integration across firms is suggestive of the well-known tension between internal and external diffusion of knowledge. In this paper, we argue that the hidden cost of KI is to expose firms to a higher risk of knowledge leakages and provide the first systematic empirical evidence of this apparent tension between internal and external knowledge flows. Based on data from the CMU Survey (one of the rare datasets offering observables on both sides of the tension for a representative set of R&D active firms in the US), we investigate the impact of knowledge spillovers to competitors on internal cross-functional knowledge integration involving the R&D function among manufacturing firms. We find that the intensity of (tacit) R&D knowledge spillovers at the industry-level has a negative and significant impact on the likelihood that firms adopt or achieve KI. Our results therefore suggest that firms may trade their optimal innovative performance against superior appropriability of their rents.

AB A vast literature on technology transitions within industries suggests that early phases of new technologies are marked by periods of intense experimentation, but we know little about the conditions under which these periods emerge. We apply inductive, grounded theory-building techniques to examine what prompts firms to experiment across one emerging technology platform-plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs)-in China. Triangulating annual vehicle make and model sales data from 2003 to 2016 (plus monthly data from 2010 to 2016); 112 English and Mandarin archival documents from industry, academic, and news outlets; and 51 semi-structured interviews with industry, government, and academic stakeholders, we develop four in-depth case studies. We find that in contrast to the innovation trajectories of multinational and Chinese arms of joint venture (JV) firms, independent domestic Chinese firms (those with no history of international JV partnerships) are undertaking significant experimentation across multiple levels-infrastructure, core system, subsystem, and component-of the emerging PEV technology platform. We propose the concept of "institutional complementarities" to describe how interactions among institutions-here the national JV regulation and local market support and subsidies-may have turned regional markets into protected laboratories, extending the incubation periods for independent domestic firm experimentation. While this diverse experimentation may be an important antecedent of technology transition, consolidation induced by national policy standardization or competitive pressure may be required for PEV innovations to scale beyond their early, protected regional markets.

AB Research and Technology Organizations (RTOs) and universities are important elements of countries' innovation systems. As they are both halfway between science and industry, they are often considered to be the same thing. However, recent studies have stressed the differences between the two. In this paper, we analyze the innovative characteristics (impacts and types of innovation and internal R&D investments) of firms that collaborate with RTOs versus universities. Our study is based on statistical analysis of Community Innovation Survey micro-data (CIS 2012). Our results suggest that firms that see RTOs as more important sources of knowledge than universities have a higher probability of developing service innovation, invest less in internal R&D but are less likely to introduce new, groundbreaking innovations into the market. These results have significant policy and management implications, especially regarding the different but complementary contributions offered respectively by RTOs and universities.

AB The link between knowledge and firm growth has been a core topic in economics of innovation for a long time. However, despite strong theoretical arguments, empirical evidence remains inconclusive. One important reason for this conundrum may be the failure of standard indicators to capture firm innovation activities comprehensively. We contribute to overcoming this limitation by looking in the knowledge processes that drive variegated forms of innovation and aim thereby to establish a solid relationship with firm growth in more detail. Our arguments draw on the differentiated knowledge base approach, distinguishing between analytical, synthetic, and symbolic knowledge. We measure the three types of knowledge bases with detailed longitudinal linked-employer-employee micro-data from Sweden. Econometric findings based on a very large sample of small and medium-sized firms indicate significantly positive effects of the three knowledge types, and in particular combinations thereof, on firm growth. In addition, we show that not only high-growth but also slow-growth firms benefit immensely from the use of combinatory knowledge bases. We find evidence on a curvilinear relation between knowledge bases and growth of firms. Beyond certain thresholds increasing the knowledge bases further results in decreasing firm growth. Our results remain robust in a wide range of specifications and econometric models.

AB This paper examines the opportunities and risks of employment, skills and education that are related to a circular economy (CE) in the United States. Combining occupational skills and education data with a newly introduced definition of CE employment, we compare circular- and non-circular-oriented occupations in terms of skills and abilities. Building on the seminal paper by Consoli et al. (2016) and looking at all occupations within a broad range of CE-related industries, we detect and address heterogeneity in job requirements within the CE. We distinguish core activities within CE employment - focusing on renewable energy, repair, re-use of materials and the sharing economy - from enabling activities, which are focused on management, design, and ICT-applicability of the CE. While core CE-activities generally require more manual and technological skills, enabling activities, in contrast, require more complex cognitive skills. Neither core nor enabling CE sectors, however, are entirely cohesive in terms of skill requirements. Part of the education and skills demand is identifiably driven by 'circularity', particularly with regard to technical skills for the core of the CE. This may require specific education and training programs for future development of the CE.

AB This paper explores technology upgrading of BRICS economies based on a three-pronged approach, which distinguishes between the intensity of technology upgrading, structural change and global interaction. We develop a statistical framework based on patent indicators to measure technological upgrading and apply it to BRICS economies in the period 1980-2015. The paper shows that there is no single path of technology upgrading. Instead, we find several unique paths with different trade-offs between intensity, structural change and the nature of the global interaction. All BRICS economies display increased generation of frontier technological activities, while China and Russia have also increased the intensity of behind frontier technological activities. China has also diversified its technology knowledge base and entered into dynamic frontier areas. With increasing intensity of frontier technology activities of the BRICS, the relative, but not absolute, the importance of foreign actors and international collaboration has declined. However, BRICS economies seem to lack the organisational and complementary capabilities to match the extent of technology sourcing from abroad, observed in high-income countries. Our result represents the application of a new conceptual framework and contributes to assessing the sustainability of innovation-based growth among BRICS.

In order to develop and evaluate policy actions in this area, monitoring the contribution of these for-profit and not-for-profit organizations to a more inclusive society becomes crucial. This research note describes the development, cognitive pretesting, and large-scale empirical testing of a module that can be included in (inter)national innovation surveys. The module measures whether not-for-profits' and for-profits' innovation activities improve vulnerable groups' access to basic provisions. It also provides insights in the main drivers for improving beneficiaries' access to basic provisions through innovation and in the types and numbers of beneficiaries reached. The module was tested in the context of the Community Innovation Survey in Flanders, Belgium.

AB While the relevance of lead users has been well established for the early phases of the innovation process, such as ideation and creativity, the relationship between lead userness and implementation and diffusion has not been investigated. This is surprising, as the conjecture that lead user ideas are more likely to be implemented and diffused than non-lead user ideas is a key tenet of lead user research. To test this conjecture we draw on a sample of 87 internal process users in a large electronics firm who submitted ideas to an idea management system. 452 ideas were suggested, of which 148 were implemented and 33 further diffused on the shopfloor. We find that higher lead userness is positively and significantly associated with the likelihood of suggested ideas being implemented and diffused. This effect is substantial: Ideas coming from lead users were more than two times more likely to be implemented and more than three times more likely to be diffused than ideas coming from non-lead users. We conclude that lead user ideas are more likely than non-lead user ideas to be implemented and diffused throughout a social system, which arguably constitutes the ultimate success of any idea. Our research contributes to research on (internal) lead users, idea management systems, and idea implementation and diffusion.

AB We examine patent licensing business models of non-practicing entities that generate revenue by selling, licensing, or litigating patents. They may also pursue R&D activities, invent new technologies, or provide services to inventors or product companies. We describe their business models and patent market behavior and then compare their litigation strategies against product companies using a matched sample of highly comparable patents. The main differences among patent licensing firms stem from their technological capabilities, patent portfolio sizes, and external relationships. We find that licensing firms with technological capabilities often pursue litigation until decision and engage in forum shopping. In contrast, litigation incidence, parties involved, and outcomes are primarily determined by patent characteristics, not entity types. Licensing business models drive the acquisition of certain types of patents that influence the outcomes of the patent system. We argue that patent policy should strengthen mechanisms to discover invention quality rather than focus on the amount of litigation or types of entities.

AB Many years after the introduction of the innovation system concept in innovation policy design, it is still not clear whether innovation policy evaluation practices follow a system approach. Building on evaluation and innovation studies, this article develops the concept 'system oriented innovation policy evaluation' based on four attributes (coverage, perspective, temporality and expertise). The attributes are used as analytical devices for gathering extensive empirical evidence on the actual practices of EU28 member states. The findings show that few countries have developed a type of innovation policy evaluation that is system oriented. The advent of a system approach to innovation policy evaluation offers the opportunity of comprehensive, contextualized and evidence-based innovation policy-making. However, there are still serious obstacles as such an approach requires important knowledge and organisational capacities. Overcoming these obstacles would need more decided evaluation capacity-building at the national level.

AB This paper investigates the determinants of the propensity of firms to export new products, and focuses on the role of new imported inputs. Importing offers access to new technologies and better combination of inputs that can lead to new or improved products for the export markets. Based on a sample of more than 14,000 Swedish manufacturing firms over the period 2001-2012, we show that importing new inputs is a key determinant of firms' propensity to add new products to their export portfolio, even after controlling for multinationality, patenting activity, productivity and a number of other firm characteristics. This is mainly due to the import of new intermediate inputs and it is stronger for smaller firms.

AB The management of the complementarity between product and process innovation has been discussed for five decades. The most recent advancement in the conceptual development uncovered different extents of cornplementarities occurring between product and process innovation at the project level. Prior literature suggested that facilitating a better interplay between these two types of innovation holds the potential for the development of a long-lasting competitive advantage. Despite its theoretical and managerial importance, management of new product and process development (NPPD) projects with different extents of complementarity between product and process innovation remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we adopt perspectives from contingency theory and dynamic capabilities. Building upon Hullova, Trott and Simms's (2016) classification of complementarities we investigate the management of different complementarity types in four NPPD projects in the UK food and drink industry. We introduce empirically derived framework for effective management of NPPD projects with different extents of complementarity between product and process innovation. The framework identifies three critical capabilities and associated activities; 1) identifying the complexity and novelty of the project and assessment of internal and external resources and knowledge stocks, 2) deploying the most suitable integration mechanism(s) for the identified complementarity type and 3) leveraging of the knowledge learned and experience acquired during the project. Jointly, these three intertwined capabilities act as a complementarity management tool for product and process development managers, enabling them to manage their NPPD projects portfolios more effectively.

AB Stronger protection of patent rights is thought to spur innovation through securing returns to R&D investments. Those investments must be financed, however, suggesting that the responsiveness of R&D to patent reforms varies with financial development levels. We examine the joint impact of domestic and international financial market development and patent protection on R&D intensities in 22 manufacturing industries in 20 OECD countries for the period 1990-2009. We show that stronger patent rights increase R&D intensities in patent-intensive industries, accounting for the need for external financing and the amount of tangible assets. The primary impact varies across types of financial development: patent protection raises R&D in high-patent industries where countries have more limited equity and credit markets. In contrast, in countries with more developed bond markets industry R&D is more sensitive to patent rights. Interestingly, patent rights in countries that are more exposed to foreign direct investment increase R&D intensities at all levels of financial development.

AB We study the employment and sales growth of entrepreneurial ventures that have received a government sponsored participative loan (PL), a hybrid form of financing between debt and equity. We use propensity-score matching (PSM) and instrumental variable analysis (2SLS) to study a sample of 512 entrepreneurial ventures that received a PL from a Spanish government agency between 2005 and 2011. We find evidence that PLs significantly boosted their beneficiaries' employment and sales. In the two years following loan issuance, a 1-million-Euro PL generated an increase in average employment of between 12.1 (PSM) and 14.7 (2SLS) units and an increase in sales of between 1.09 and 1.97 million Euro relative to the average for the two years prior to loan issuance. The effect is larger for high-tech, young and small entrepreneurial ventures and for those that received a PL during the global financial crisis. The effect on growth is significant and stable, and PLs increase their beneficiaries' annual growth by 10.6% for employment and by 18.0% for sales. We do not find evidence of industry or regional spillovers, nor do we find differences in the probability of survival of PL beneficiaries after we control for their characteristics.

AB This study investigates whether country-level technological disparities influence individual scientists' choice of research agenda and, if so, how the effect of country-level technological disparities on individuals' research activities differs before and after technology commercialization. To address these research questions, we use research proceedings published from the International Electric Vehicle Symposium (EVS) from 1990 to 2009. We find that a country's technological capabilities tend to prevent its scientists from studying electric vehicles (defined as a disruptive technology) but encourage them to study hybrid vehicles (defined as a sustaining technology) before electric and hybrid vehicles are launched in the automobile market. We also find that a country's technological capabilities do not subsequently help its scientists shift their research activities to the technologies that have received positive initial feedback from automobile markets.

AB We have developed a new algorithm which merges discrete stochastic simulation, using the spatial stochastic simulation algorithm (sSSA), with the particle based fluid dynamics simulation framework of smoothed dissipative particle dynamics (SDPD). This hybrid algorithm enables discrete stochastic simulation of spatially resolved chemically reacting systems on a mesh-free dynamic domain with a Lagrangian frame of reference. SDPD combines two popular mesoscopic techniques: smoothed particle hydrodynamics and dissipative particle dynamics (DPD), linking the macroscopic and mesoscopic hydrodynamics effects of these two methods. We have implemented discrete stochastic simulation using the reaction-diffusion master equations (RDME) formalism, and deterministic reaction-diffusion equations based on the SDPD method. We validate the new method by comparing our results to four canonical models, and demonstrate the versatility of our method by simulating a flow containing a chemical gradient past a yeast cell in a microfluidics chamber.

AB A numerical scheme with good conservation properties is developed for the simulation of free-surface turbulent and viscous wave flows using a surface-fitted curvilinear grid. The Navier-Stokes equations are written in a strong conservative formulation with respect to the curvilinear coordinates, and are discretized by a pseudo-spectral method in the horizontal directions and a finite-difference method in the vertical direction. Large-eddy simulation (LES) is implemented with the conservative scheme to extend the simulation capability to turbulent flows with higher Reynolds numbers. Fully nonlinear kinematic and dynamic boundary conditions are implemented at the free surface. The numerical scheme is validated using a variety of wave and vortical flow test cases. The results show good agreement with previous theoretical and numerical predictions, whereas the present scheme achieves significant improvement in the conservation of mass and momentum over the non-conservative scheme developed by Yang & Shen [1]. Meanwhile, the present conservative scheme is found to be more stable than the non-conservative scheme for the simulation of sideband waves and broadband waves. The effect of viscous dissipation on the long-term nonlinear wave evolution is also captured by the present scheme. The ability of the present scheme for simulating long-term wave-current-turbulence interaction is demonstrated by the computation of Langmuir circulation, for which the non-conservative scheme produces significant errors in mass and momentum conservation and the simulation fails. Flow features of the Langmuir circulation, such as the counter-rotating vortices and converging-diverging zones, have been successfully captured with our numerical scheme. The turbulence statistics also agree with the characteristics of Langmuir circulation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We present two discretization methods for solving the fractional magneto-hydrodynamic (FMHD) equations with the fractional Laplacian defined in bounded domains. In the first method, we add a pseudo-pressure in the magnetic field equation to enforce that the magnetic field is divergence-free. In the second method, the magnetic field satisfies the divergence-free condition automatically with the no-slip boundary condition for the velocity and the perfectly conducting boundary condition for the magnetic field equation. In addition, we propose a discretization method for solving the modified fractional magneto-hydrodynamic (M-FMHD) equation. The divergence-free condition is preserved by employing the stream function in the M-FMHD system. Numerical experiments with fabricated solutions show that all three methods exhibit second-order accuracy in time for the velocity and magnetic fields. The pseudo-pressure and pressure also exhibit second-order convergence in time for small values of time step, however the pressure exhibits 1.5-order for convergence for large values of time step size when the fractional order alpha = 1. We use the spectral decomposition method for spatial discretization, and we demonstrate that exponential convergence is achieved for all fields and for any fractional order. We also applied these methods to solve the lid-driven cavity flow with and without magnetic field, and we observe new flow patterns emerging as the fractional order varies. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB Numerical simulations of multi-scale flow problems such as hypersonic boundary layer transition, turbulent flows, computational aeroacoustics and various other flow problems with complex physics require high-order methods with high spectral resolutions. For instance, the receptivity mechanisms in the hypersonic boundary layer are the resonant interactions between forcing waves and boundary-layer waves, and the complex wave interactions are difficult to be accurately predicted by conventional low-order numerical methods. High-order methods, which are robust and accurate in resolving a wide range of time and length scales, are required. Currently, the high-order finite difference methods for simulations of hypersonic flows are usually upwind schemes or compact schemes with fifth-order accuracy or lower [1]. The objective of this paper is to develop and analyze a new very high-order numerical scheme with the spectral-like resolution for flow simulations on structured grids, with focus on smooth flow problems involving multiple scales. Specifically, a new upwind multi-layer compact (MLC) scheme with spectral-like resolution up to seventh order is derived in a finite difference framework. By using the 'multi-layer' idea, which introduces first derivatives into the MLC schemes and approximates the second derivatives, the resolution of the MLC schemes can be significantly improved within a compact grid stencil. The auxiliary equations are required and they are the only nontrivial equations, which contributes to good computational efficiency. In addition, the upwind MLC schemes are derived based on the idea of constructing upwind schemes on centered stencils with adjustable parameters to control the dissipation. Fourier analysis is performed to show that the MLC schemes have small dissipation and dispersion in a very wide range of wavenumbers in both one- and two-dimensional cases, and the anisotropic error is much smaller than conventional finite difference methods in the two-dimensional case. Furthermore, the stability analysis with matrix method shows that high-order boundary closure schemes are stable because of compactness of the stencils. The accuracies and rates of convergence of the new schemes are validated by numerical experiments of the linear advection equation, the nonlinear Euler equations, and the Navier-Stokes equations. The numerical results show that good computational efficiency, very high-order accuracies, and high spectral resolutions especially on coarse meshes can be attained with the MLC schemes. Overall, the MLC scheme has the properties of simple formulations, high-order accuracies, spectral-like resolutions, and compact stencils, and it is suitable for accurate simulation of smooth multi-scale flows with complex physics.

AB In this paper, we develop high-order bound-preserving (BP) discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods for the coupled system of compressible miscible displacements on triangular meshes. We consider the problem with multi-component fluid mixture and the (volumetric) concentration of the jth component, c(j), should be between 0 and 1. There are three main difficulties. Firstly, c(j) does not satisfy a maximum-principle. Therefore, the numerical techniques introduced in Zhang and Shu (2010) [44] cannot be applied directly. The main idea is to apply the positivity-preserving techniques to all C'(s)(j) and enforce Sigma(j)c(j) = 1 simultaneously to obtain physically relevant approximations. By doing so, we have to treat the time derivative of the pressure dp/dt as a source in the concentration equation and choose suitable fluxes in the pressure and concentration equations. Secondly, it is not easy to construct first-order numerical fluxes for interior penalty DG methods on triangular meshes. One of the key points in the high-order BP technique applied in this paper is the combination of high-order and lower-order numerical fluxes. We will construct second-order BP schemes and use the second-order numerical fluxes as the lower-order one. Finally, the classical slope limiter cannot be applied to c(j). To construct the BP technique, we will not approximate c(j) directly. Therefore, a new limiter will be introduced. Numerical experiments will be given to demonstrate the high-order accuracy and good performance of the numerical technique. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The kinetic theory of rarefied gases and numerical schemes based on the Boltzmann equation, have evolved to the cornerstone of non-equilibrium gas dynamics. However, their counterparts in the dense regime remain rather exotic for practical non-continuum scenarios. This problem is partly due to the fact that long-range interactions arising from the attractive tail of molecular potentials, lead to a computationally demanding Vlasov integral. This study focuses on numerical remedies for efficient stochastic particle simulations based on the Enskog-Vlasov kinetic equation. In particular, we devise a Poisson type elliptic equation which governs the underlying long-range interactions. The idea comes through fitting a Green function to the molecular potential, and hence deriving an elliptic equation for the associated fundamental solution. Through this transformation of the Vlasov integral, efficient Poisson type solvers can be readily employed in order to compute the mean field forces. Besides the technical aspects of different numerical schemes for treatment of the Vlasov integral, simulation results for evaporation of a liquid slab into the vacuum are presented. It is shown that the proposed formulation leads to accurate predictions with a reasonable computational cost. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB An efficient method to capture an arbitrary number of fluid/structure interfaces in a level-set framework is built, following ideas introduced for contour capturing in image analysis. Using only three label maps and two distance functions we succeed in locating and evolving the bodies independently in the whole domain and get the distance between the closest bodies in order to apply a collision force whatever the number of cells is. The method is applied to rigid solid bodies in order to compare to the results available in the literature. In that case, a global penalization model uses the label maps to follow the solid bodies all together without a separate computation of each body velocity. Numerical simulations are performed in two- and three-dimensions. An application to immersed vesicles is also proposed and shows the capability and efficiency of the method to handle numerical contacts between elastic bodies at low resolution. Two-dimensional simulations of vesicles under various flow conditions are presented. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The Boltzmann equation, an integro-differential equation for the molecular distribution function in the physical and velocity phase space, governs the fluid flow behavior at a wide range of physical conditions, including compressible, turbulent, as well as flows involving further physics such as non-equilibrium internal energy exchange and chemical reactions. Despite its wide applicability, deterministic solution of the Boltzmann equation presents a huge computational challenge, and often the collision operator is simplified for practical reasons. In this work, we introduce a highly accurate deterministic method for the full Boltzmann equation which couples the Runge-Kutta discontinuous Galerkin (RKDG) discretization in time and physical space (Su et al. (2015) [1]) and the recently developed fast Fourier spectral method in velocity space (Gamba et al. (2017) [2]). The novelty of this approach encompasses three aspects: first, the fast spectral method for the collision operator applies to general collision kernels with little or no practical limitations, and in order to adapt to the spatial discretization, we propose here a singular-value-decomposition based algorithm to further reduce the cost in evaluating the collision term; second, the DG formulation employed has high order of accuracy at element-level, and has shown to be more efficient than the finite volume method; thirdly, the element-local compact nature of DG as well as our collision algorithm is amenable to effective parallelization on massively parallel architectures. The solver has been verified against analytical Bobylev-Krook-Wu solution. Further, the standard benchmark test cases of rarefied Fourier heat transfer, Couette flow, oscillatory Couette flow, normal shock wave, lid-driven cavity flow, and thermally driven cavity flow have been studied and their results are compared against direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) solutions with equivalent molecular collision models or published deterministic solutions.

AB High-order discontinuous Galerkin methods have become a popular technique in computational fluid dynamics because their accuracy increases spectrally in smooth solutions with the order of the approximation. However, their main drawback is that increasing the order also increases the computational cost. Several techniques have been introduced in the past to reduce this cost. On the one hand, local mesh adaptation strategies based on error estimation have been proposed to reduce the number of degrees of freedom while keeping a similar accuracy. On the other hand, multigrid solvers may accelerate time marching computations for a fixed number of degrees of freedom.
   In this paper, we combine both methods and present a novel anisotropic p-adaptation multigrid algorithm for steady-state problems that uses the multigrid scheme both as a solver and as an anisotropic error estimator. To achieve this, we show that a recently developed anisotropic truncation error estimator [1, A. M. Rueda-Ramirez, G. Rubio, E. Ferrer, E. Valero, Truncation error estimation in the p-anisotropic discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method, J. Sci. Comput.] is perfectly suited to be performed inside the multigrid cycle with negligible extra cost. Furthermore, we introduce a multi-stage p-adaptation procedure which reduces the computational time when very accurate results are required.
   The proposed methods are tested for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations, where we investigate two steady-state cases. First, the 2D boundary layer flow on a flat plate is studied to assess accuracy and computational cost of the algorithm, where a speed-up of 816 is achieved compared to the traditional explicit method. Second, the 3D flow around a sphere is simulated and used to test the anisotropic properties of the proposed method, where a speed-up of 152 is achieved compared to the explicit method. The proposed multi-stage procedure achieved a speed-up of 2.6 in comparison to the single-stage method in highly accurate simulations. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper deals with the a-priori assignment of polynomial order in the p-version of the FEM for the efficient simulation of time-harmonic acoustics problems. Anisotropic p-refinement, allowing direction-dependent polynomial approximations is examined, including for unstructured meshes with curved elements. A methodology to automatically choose the order repartition in the model is proposed and verified. These features are important for two main reasons. First, they allow to better control the accuracy on distorted elements with large aspect ratios. This in turn makes the numerical model less sensitive to the quality of the finite element mesh. Secondly, this allows to deal efficiently with problems where the wave properties are anisotropic. The restriction on the numerical resolution can be relaxed to obtain significant reductions in the computational cost compared to classical, isotropic order adaptivity. The paper presents several examples of the efficiency and robustness of the method for the propagation of acoustic waves on distorted meshes and/or in the presence of strong background mean flows.

AB This paper proposes two regularized models of the mu(I)-rheology and shows their application to the numerical simulation of 3D dense granular flows. The proposed regularizations are inspired by the Papanastasiou and Bercovier-Engleman methods, typically used to approximate the Bingham law. The key idea is to keep limited the value of the apparent viscosity for low shear rates without introducing a fixed cutoff. The proposed techniques are introduced into the Particle Finite Element Method (PFEM) framework to deal with the large deformations expected in free-surface granular flows. After showing the numerical drawbacks associated to the standard mu(I)-rheology, the two regularization strategies are derived and discussed. The regularized mu (I)-rheology is then applied to the simulation of the collapse of 2D and 3D granular columns. The numerical results show that the regularization techniques improve substantially the conditioning of the linear system without affecting the solution accuracy. A good agreement with the experimental tests and other numerical methods is obtained in all the analyzed problems. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB With the objective of simulating wave propagation in the nearshore zone for engineering-scale applications, a two dimensional (2DV) model based on the Euler-Zakharov equations [73,54] is extended to three dimensions (3D). To maintain the flexibility of the approach with the goal of applying the model to irregularly shaped domains, the horizontal plane is discretized with scattered nodes. The horizontal derivatives are then estimated using the Radial Basis Function-Finite Difference (RBF-FD) method, while a spectral approach is used in the vertical dimension. A sensitivity analysis examined the robustness of the RBF-FD approach as a function of REF parameters when estimating the derivatives of a representative function. For a targeted stencil size between 20 and 30 nodes, Piecewise-Smooth (PS) polyharmonic spline (PHS) functions are recommended, avoiding the use of Infinitely-Smooth (IS) RBFs, which are less appropriate for the desired applications because of their dependence on a shape parameter. Comparisons of simulation results to observations from two wave basin experiments show that nonlinear effects induced by complex bottom bathymetries are reproduced well by the model with the recommended REF approach, validating the use of this method for 3D simulations of wave propagation.

AB In this work, a multiscale model for thermomechanical properties of composite structures containing phase change particles is developed. For the mechanical part, a classical linear computational homogenization procedure is employed. For the thermal part, due to the strong nonlinear, history-dependent thermal effects, a concurrent multiscale (FE2) method is extended to take into account the presence of Phase Change Materials particles (PCM) at the microscale. The PCM inclusions change from liquid to solid state in the range of room temperature. This phase change induces a modified macroscopic thermal behavior, which can be used e.g. to design materials with enhanced thermal inertia and reduce energy consumption in civil engineering constructions. The technique allows taking into account accurately the fully nonlinear, history-dependent thermal behavior through numerical calculations at the microscale based on a Representative Volume Element (RVE) and its effect at the macroscale. The method is applied to concrete material including paraffin wax PCM. The results show the benefits of the PCM on the thermal behavior, including shifted and smoothed temperature response as compared to materials without PCM particles. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB A high-order well-balanced scheme for the Euler equations with gravitation is presented. The scheme is able to preserve a spatially high-order accurate discrete representation of isentropic hydrostatic equilibria. It is based on a novel local hydrostatic reconstruction, which, in combination with any standard high-order accurate reconstruction procedure, achieves genuine high-order accuracy for smooth solutions close or away from equilibrium. The resulting scheme is very simple and can be implemented into any existing finite volume code with minimal effort. Moreover, the scheme is not tied to any particular form of the equation of state, which is crucial for example in astrophysical applications. Several numerical experiments were performed with a third-order accurate reconstruction. They demonstrate the robustness and high-order accuracy of the scheme nearby and out of hydrostatic equilibrium. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper we consider Riemann problems for the shallow water equations with discontinuous topography whose initial conditions correspond to a wet-dry front: at time t = 0 there is vacuum on the right or on the left of the step. Besides the theoretical interest of this analysis, the results may be useful to design numerical methods and/or to produce reference solutions to compare different schemes. We show that, depending on the state at the wet side, 0, 1, or 2 self-similar solutions can be constructed by composing simple waves. In problems with 0 solutions, the step acts as an obstacle for the fluid and physically meaningful solutions can be constructed by interpreting the problem as a partial Riemann problems for the homogeneous shallow water system. Some numerical results are shown where different numerical methods are compared. In particular, it is shown that, in the non-uniqueness cases, the numerical solutions can converge to one or to the other solution, what is the reason that explains the huge differences observed when different numerical methods are applied to the shallow water system with abrupt changes in the bottom. Moreover, problems with zero solutions will be reinterpreted as Partial Riemann problems for the homogeneous system what will allow us to build a physically solution. When one side of the step is wet and the other one is dry. We will specify the regions where we can find zero, one or two solutions, giving the form of the solution when it is possible and giving an alternative when it is not possible. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB We construct entropy conservative and entropy stable discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretizations for time-dependent nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws on curvilinear meshes. The resulting schemes preserve a semi-discrete quadrature approximation of a continuous global entropy inequality. The proof requires the satisfaction of a discrete geometric conservation law, which we enforce through an appropriate polynomial approximation. We extend the construction of entropy conservative and entropy stable DG schemes to the case when high order curvilinear mass matrices are approximated using low-storage weight-adjusted approximations, and describe how to retain global conservation properties under such an approximation. For certain types of curvilinear meshes, these weight-adjusted approximations deliver optimal rates of convergence. Finally, the high order accuracy, local conservation, and discrete conservation or dissipation of entropy for under-resolved solutions are verified through numerical experiments for the compressible Euler equations on triangular and tetrahedral meshes.

The optimal convergence in the H-1 norm is proved under some regularity assumptions. We mention that, for the lowest-order case on triangular meshes the nonconforming virtual element method coincides with the nonconforming finite element method presented by Brenner and Sung (1992) [19] up to an approximation of the right-hand side. Besides, we also present the nonconforming virtual element method for the pure traction problem, which is proved to be uniformly convergent with respect to the Lame constant. Finally, we demonstrate the optimal convergence and stability of the nonconforming virtual element method by some numerical results. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A high-order accurate scheme for solving the time-domain Maxwell's equations with a generalized dispersive material model is described. The equations for the electric field are solved in second-order form, and a general dispersion model is treated with the addition of one or more polarization vectors which obey a set of auxiliary differential equations (ADE). Numerical methods are developed for both second-order and fourth-order accuracy in space and time. The equations are discretized using finite-differences, and advanced in time with a single-stage, three-level, space-time scheme which remains stable up to the usual explicit CFL restriction, as proven using mode analysis. Because the equations are treated in their second-order form, there is no need for grid staggering, and instead a collocated grid is used. Composite overlapping grids are used to treat complex geometries with boundary-conforming grids, and a high-order upwind dissipation is added to ensure robust and stable approximations on overlapping grids. Numerical results in two and three space dimensions confirm the accuracy and stability of the new schemes. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB From the early stages of CFD, the computation of shocks using Finite Volume methods has been a very challenging task as they often prompt the generation of numerical anomalies. Such anomalies lead to an incorrect and unstable representation of the discrete shock profile that may eventually ruin the whole solution. The two most widespread anomalies are the slowly-moving shock anomaly and the carbuncle, which are deeply addressed in the literature in the framework of homogeneous problems, such as Euler equations. In this work, the presence of the aforementioned anomalies is studied in the framework of the 1D and 2D SWE and novel solvers that effectively reduce both anomalies, even in cases where source terms dominate the solution, are presented. Such solvers are based on the augmented Roe (ARoe) family of Riemann solvers, which account for the source term as an extra wave in the eigenstructure of the system. The novel method proposed here is based on the ARoe solver in combination with: (a) an improved flux extrapolation method based on a previous work, which circumvents the slowly-moving shock anomaly and (b) a contact wave smearing technique that avoids the carbuncle. The resulting method is able to eliminate the slowly-moving shock anomaly for 1D steady cases with source term. When dealing with 2D cases, the novel method proves to handle complex shock structures composed of hydraulic jumps over irregular bathymetries, avoiding the presence of the aforementioned anomalies.

AB The Harten-Lax-van Leer with contact (HLLC) approximate Riemann solver is known to be plagued by various forms of numerical shock instability. In this paper, we propose a new framework for developing shock stable versions of the HLLC scheme for the Euler system of equations without compromising on its contact and shear preserving ability. The proposed framework, termed as Selective Wave Modification (SWM), identifies and enhances the magnitude of the inherent HLL-type diffusive component within the HLLC scheme in the vicinity of a normal shock front. This is achieved by suitably increasing the magnitudes of the nonlinear wave speed estimates appearing in them through a dissipation parameter is an element of. A linear perturbation analysis is performed to gauge the effectiveness of the proposed framework in damping unwanted perturbations in physical quantities and is also used to estimate a von-Neumann-type stability bound on the CFL number associated with its use. Two distinct methods to estimate is an element of, which results in HLLC-SWM-E (Eigenvalue based) and HLLC-SWM-P (Pressure based) schemes, are proposed and compared. Further, a matrix based stability analysis is used to show that the proposed schemes can be configured to remain shock stable over a wide range of free stream Mach numbers. Numerical results confirm that the proposed schemes are capable of computing shock stable solutions for a wide variety of problems. On viscous flows, the HLLC-SWM-P variant is found to be the most accurate. Performance of these schemes suggests that it is possible to construct shock stable upwind schemes that simultaneously retains accuracy on the linearly degenerate wavefields. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB A new front tracking method is developed through using Lagrangian particles marked by their extended location information (ELI) including the location coordinates and the spatial derivatives of the location coordinates. The new method is capable of providing more accurate descriptions for the geometrical features of the interface than the conventional front tracking (CFT) methods due to three key originalities. First, high order numerical schemes that can be used to evaluate the ELI of the interpolated particles with high order accuracy are developed based on the ELI of two given particles. Second, a series of evolution equations are derived on the need of tracking the ELI of all the particles during the interface evolving. Third, transformation formulae are derived for the use of modifying the spatial derivatives of the particles' location coordinates such that large amplitudes of which can be avoided. Performances of the new method are demonstrated through standard benchmark tests. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper introduces a fast algorithm, applicable throughout the electromagnetic spectrum, for the numerical solution of problems of scattering by periodic surfaces in two-dimensional space. The proposed algorithm remains highly accurate and efficient for challenging configurations including randomly rough surfaces, deep corrugations, large periods, near grazing incidences, and, importantly, Wood-anomaly resonant frequencies. The proposed approach is based on use of certain "shifted equivalent sources" which enable FFT acceleration of a Wood-anomaly-capable quasi-periodic Green function introduced recently (Bruno and Delourme (2014) [4]). The Green-function strategy additionally incorporates an exponentially convergent shifted version of the classical spectral series for the Green function. While the computing-cost asymptotics depend on the asymptotic configuration assumed, the computing costs rise at most linearly with the size of the problem for a number of important rough-surface cases we consider. In practice, single-core runs in computing times ranging from a fraction of a second to a few seconds suffice for the proposed algorithm to produce highly-accurate solutions in some of the most challenging contexts arising in applications.

AB The Couette flow is one of the fundamental problems of rarefied gas dynamics, which has been investigated extensively based on the linearized Boltzmann equation (LBE) of hard-sphere molecules and simplified kinetic model equations. However, how the different intermolecular potentials affect the viscous slip coefficient and the structure of Knudsen layer remains unclear. Here, a novel synthetic iteration scheme (SIS) is developed for the LBE to find solutions of Couette flow accurately and efficiently: the velocity distribution function is first solved by the conventional iterative scheme, then it is modified such that in each iteration i) the flow velocity is guided by an ordinary differential equation that is asymptotic-preserving at the Navier-Stokes limit and ii) the shear stress is equal to the average shear stress. Based on the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook model, the SIS is assessed to be efficient and accurate. Then we investigate the Knudsen layer function for gases interacting through the inverse power-law, shielded Coulomb, and Lennard-Jones potentials, subject to diffuse-specular and Cercignani-Lampis gas-surface boundary conditions. When the tangential momentum accommodation coefficient (TMAC) is not larger than one, the Knudsen layer function is strongly affected by the potential, where its value and width increase with the effective viscosity index of gas molecules. Moreover, the Knudsen layer function exhibits similarities among different values of TMAC when the intermolecular potential is fixed. For Cercignani-Lampis boundary condition with TMAC larger than one, both the viscous slip coefficient and Knudsen layer function are affected by the intermolecular potential, especially when the "backward" scattering limit is approached. With the asymptotic theory by Jiang and Luo (2016) [14] for the singular behavior of the velocity gradient in the vicinity of solid surfaces, we find that the whole Knudsen layer function can be well fitted by the power series Sigma(2)(n=0) Sigma(2)(m=0) c(n,m)x(n) (xlnx)(m), where x is the distance to the solid surface. Finally, the experimental data of the Knudsen layer profile are explained by the LEE solution with proper values of the viscosity index and TMAC. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB We propose a new tool for the study of the parabolic p-curl problem modelling the magnetic field in a high-temperature superconductor (HTS), a problem involving an operator del x (|del x H|(p-2)del x H) analogous to the p-Laplacian. This so-called nonlinear p-curl problem is computationally expensive in three space dimensions because sharp fronts in the magnetic field develop near the surface of HTS. The proposed technique is a relaxation model of the p-curl problem which is shown to provide a consistent and stable approximation according to first, an inner/outer layer analysis and secondly, according to a time scale expansion. The relaxation model leads to monotone approximations of the front because of the presence of anisotropic diffusion. Most importantly, it can be used to develop new schemes that inherit the properties of the relaxation model.
   In order to demonstrate the relevance of the relaxation model, this paper applies the approximation to the construction of a second-order nonlinear finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method, similar to Yee's scheme. It is shown that the natural discretization of the p-curl inspired by Yee's scheme leads to an unstable scheme, while a discretization based on the relaxation model is stable. We propose two numerical discretizations that are respectively first and second order in time, but both second-order in space. The linear and nonlinear stability of the schemes is studied and it is demonstrated that the schemes are both discrete divergence free. We verify the numerical schemes using manufactured solutions and Mayergoyz's moving-front solution in both one and two space dimensions, as well as on a magnetization of a typical HTS.

AB This work presents three methods for enforcing tangential velocity boundary conditions for the MEEVC scheme, which was shown to be mass, enstrophy, energy and vorticity conserving scheme in the case of inviscid flow [1]. While the normal velocity component can be strongly imposed in a div-conforming formulation for the velocity field, inclusion of the tangential velocity needs to be set through an appropriate choice of vorticity boundary conditions. Three methods to impose the tangential velocity boundary condition will be discussed: The kinematic Dirichlet formulation, the kinematic Neumann formulation and the dynamic Neumann formulation. The conservation properties of each of the resulting schemes are analyzed and numerical results are shown for the Taylor-Green vortex and for the dipole collision test cases. These confirm that kinematic Neumann vorticity boundary conditions perform best. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A high-order numerical method for interface-preserving level-set reinitialization is presented in this paper. In the interface cells, the gradient of the level-set function is determined by a weighted local projection scheme and the missing additive constant is determined such that the position of the zero level set is preserved. In the non-interface cells, we compute the gradient of the level-set function by solving a Hamilton-Jacobi equation as a conservation law system using the discontinuous Galerkin method, following the work by Hu and Shu [SIAM J. Sci. Comput. 21 (1999) 660-690]; the missing constant is then recovered by the continuity of the level-set function while taking into account the characteristics. To handle highly distorted initial conditions, we develop a hybrid numerical flux that combines the Lax-Friedrichs flux and the penalty flux. Our method is stable for non-trivial test cases and handles singularities away from the interface very well. When derivative singularities are present on the interface, a second-derivative limiter is designed to suppress the oscillations. At least (N + 1)th order accuracy in the interface cells and Nth order in the whole domain are observed for smooth solutions when Nth degree polynomials are used. Two dimensional test cases are presented to demonstrate superior properties such as accuracy, long-term stability, interface-preserving capability, and easy treatment of contact lines. We also show some preliminary results on the pinch-off process of a pendant drop, where topological changes of the fluid interface are involved. Our method is readily extendable to three dimensions and adaptive meshes. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We consider numerical simulation of the isotropic elastic wave equations arising from seismic applications with non-trivial land topography. The more flexible finite element method is applied to the shallow region of the simulation domain to account for the topography, and combined with the more efficient finite difference method that is applied to the deep region of the simulation domain. We demonstrate that these two discretization methods, albeit starting from different formulations of the elastic wave equation, can be joined together smoothly via weakly imposed interface conditions. Discrete energy analysis is employed to derive the proper interface treatment, leading to an overall discretization that is energy-conserving. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed interface treatment. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We introduce physics-informed neural networks - neural networks that are trained to solve supervised learning tasks while respecting any given laws of physics described by general nonlinear partial differential equations. In this work, we present our developments in the context of solving two main classes of problems: data-driven solution and data-driven discovery of partial differential equations. Depending on the nature and arrangement of the available data, we devise two distinct types of algorithms, namely continuous time and discrete time models. The first type of models forms a new family of data-efficient spatio-temporal function approximators, while the latter type allows the use of arbitrarily accurate implicit Runge-Kutta time stepping schemes with unlimited number of stages. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through a collection of classical problems in fluids, quantum mechanics, reaction-diffusion systems, and the propagation of nonlinear shallow-water waves.

AB In this work, a new parallel dual-grid multiscale approach for CFD-DEM couplings is investigated. Dual-grid multiscale CFD-DEM couplings have been recently developed and successfully adopted in different applications still, an efficient parallelization for such a numerical method represents an open issue. Despite its ability to provide grid convergent solutions and more accurate results than standard CFD-DEM couplings, this young numerical method requires good parallel performances in order to be applied to large-scale problems and, therefore, extend its range of application. The parallelization strategy here proposed aims to take advantage of the enhanced complexity of a dual-grid coupling to gain more flexibility in the domain partitioning while keeping a low inter-process communication cost. In particular, it allows avoiding inter-process communication between CFD and DEM software and still allows adopting complex partitioning strategies thanks to an optimized grid-based communication. It is shown how the parallelized multiscale coupling holds all its natural advantages over a mono-scale coupling and can also have better parallel performance. Three benchmark cases are presented to assess the accuracy and performance of the strategy. It is shown how the proposed method allows maintaining good parallel performance when operated over 1000 processes. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This article deals with acoustic computations in low Mach number flows with density based solvers. For ensuring a good resolution of the low Mach number base flow, a scheme able to deal with stationary low Mach number flows is necessary. Previously proposed low Mach number fixes are tested with acoustic computations. Numerical results prove that they are not accurate for acoustic computations. The issues raised with acoustic computations with low Mach number fixes are discussed, and a new scheme is developed, in order to be accurate not only for steady low Mach number flows, but also for acoustic computations. Numerical tests show the improvement of the proposed scheme with respect to the state of the art. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

   FRAMEWORK
AB This paper presents an immersed boundary method (IBM) to model the behaviour of solid-fluid interfaces in incompressible flows on non-conforming, unstructured meshes. Based on a smooth-interface direct forcing formulation, the proposed forcing method directly and implicitly uses the discretised momentum equations to evaluate the source terms required to enforce a no-slip condition on the boundary. The IBM is derived for a finite-volume framework with an implicit pressure-velocity coupling and a colocated variable arrangement, to enable application in complex domains. The novel framework is applied to flows with stationary and moving IBs on both Cartesian and tetrahedral meshes, and the results are compared to and validated with findings reported in the literature. The results demonstrate that the proposed formulation results in an accurate enforcement of the no-slip condition on the IB at every time-step, even for flows with strong transient behaviour and high velocity and pressure gradients. The results are similar to or better than those obtained with other methods that can only be applied on Cartesian meshes. The current method is shown to accurately preserve local continuity in the vicinity of the IB, ensuring local and global mass conservation in addition to satisfying the local no-slip condition. Moreover, the proposed forcing framework shows good results for unstructured meshes, with a similar accuracy as obtained on Cartesian meshes. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID NUMBER
AB In predictive tasks like classification, Information Gain (IG) based Decision Tree is very popularly used. However, IG method has some inherent problems like its preference towards choosing attributes with higher number of distinct values as the splitting attribute in case of nominal attributes and another problem is associated with imbalanced datasets. Most of the real-world datasets have many nominal attributes, and those nominal attributes may have many number of distinct values. In this paper, we have tried to point out these characteristics of the datasets while discussing the performance of our proposed approach. Our approach is a variant of the traditional Decision Tree model and uses a new technique called Dispersion_Ratio, a modification of existing Correlation Ratio (CR) method. The whole approach is divided into two phases - firstly, the dataset is discretised using a discretization module and secondly, the preprocessed dataset is used to build a Dispersion Ratio based Decision Tree model. The proposed method does not prefer the attributes with many unique values and indifferent about class distribution. It performs better than previously proposed CR based Decision Tree (CRDT) Model since an efficient discretization module has been added with it. We have evaluated the performance of our approach on some benchmark datasets from various domains to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique and also compared our model with Information Gain, Gain Ratio and Gini Index based models. Result shows that the proposed model outperforms other models in majority of the cases that we have considered in our experiment. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Task allocation for a multi-robot system is often imposed with various constraints to promote efficiency and avoid unwanted consequences. This study focuses on the min-max balanced connected q-partition problem (BCPq) that seeks the early completion time of a multi-robot system while satisfying mission constraints. In the problem, each environmental region is modeled as a weighted node of a graph and the graph is to be partitioned into a predefined number, q, of disjoint node sets, such that nodes in each set are connected and the largest "sum of the set" is as small as possible. The problem is NP-hard in general cases, and has a brute-force search space exponential to the number of nodes. BCPq arises in many fields besides robotics. To date, existing work has mainly been conducted on special versions of the problem, such as small q or special types of graphs. In this study, we propose two approaches for the general case: one is exact and suitable for graphs of less than 200 nodes, while the other is approximate and can handle graphs with up to 3000 nodes. Specifically, this study presents the first exact mixed integer linear program (MILP) in the literature that can partition an arbitrary graph into a given arbitrary number of components. The MILP is based on a flow model and can solve graphs with 100 more nodes than the existing MILP that can only tackle 2-partition in the q = 2 case. The study also presents an approximate genetic algorithm (GA) based on tree partition and tree evolution. It is the first GA that can handle BCPq (q >= 2) problems. On graphs of less than 500 nodes and 2-partition, the GA achieved all the optima in 20 runs. On q <= 12, this GA also can achieve results close to the optima after a few individuals were evolved, i.e., a gap smaller than 3% of the ideal average value. Moreover, the GA is scalable to q as the consumed time is nearly stable, independent of q. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Recent findings in operations research and decision theory show that the eigenvectors derived from pair wise comparison matrices are not Pareto optimal in all cases. Thus, looking at the traditional eigenvector method of Saaty, a better approximation may exist for characterizing the decision makers' opinion. The Pareto optimal modified vector may lead to better decisions for better expressing the real intention of the evaluator. This paper aims to examine Pareto-optimality on real data pairwise comparison matrices gained from a public transport Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) survey. Moreover, detecting the impact of weight score modification on the whole AHP structure and thus the significance of Pareto test is also in the scope of this study. Further, a detailed description of the general process of Pareto optimal AHP is also included. The application has been conducted in Mersin, Turkey with the purpose of determining public preference on the importance of developing supply quality elements in local bus transportation service.

DE Persuasive agent; Virtual companion; Multi-agent systems; Coordination
AB Assistive agents have been used to give advices to the users regarding activities in daily lives. Although adviser bots are getting smarter and gaining more popularity these days they are usually developed and deployed independent from each other. When several agents operate together in the same context, their advices may no longer be effective since they may instead overwhelm or confuse the user if not properly arranged. Only little attentions have been paid to coordinating different agents to give different advices to a user within the same environment. However, aligning the advices on-the-fly with the appropriate presentation timing at the right context still remains a great challenge. In this paper, a coordination framework for advice giving and persuasive agents is presented. Apart from preventing overwhelming messages, the adaptation enables cooperation among the agents to make their advices more impactful. In contrast to conventional models that rely on natural language contents or direct multi-modal cues to align the dialogs, the proposed framework is built to be more practical allowing the agents to actively share their observation, goals, and plans to each other. This allows them to adapt the schedules, strategies, and contents of their scheduled advices or reminders at runtime with respect to each other's objectives. Challenges and issues in multi-agent adviser systems are identified and defined in this paper supported by a survey study about perceived usefulness and user comprehensibility of advices delivered by multiple agents. The coordination among the advice giving agents are investigated and exemplified with a simulation of activity of daily living in the context of aging in place. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Spoof fingerprint detectors based on static features are built by learning a set of live and fake fingerprint images. These learning-based spoof detectors cannot accurately classify new or untrained types of fakes. To handle this problem, the existing spoof detector should be incrementally trained on the new types of fakes. This paper proposes a new spoof detection framework to learn new types of fakes incrementally without retraining the existing spoof detector repeatedly. The proposed model discriminates the newly learned fakes without serious loss of performance for the previously learned fakes and at the same time provides promising detection results for the various types of fakes. The proposed spoof detector integrates multiple "experts," each of which shares the same structure but is separately trained for a different set of fake fingerprints. To detect a new type of fake fingerprint, a new expert exclusively trained on the new fake type is integrated into the spoof detector. Each expert consists of multiple support vector machines (SVMs) applied by an incremental learning algorithm (Learn++.NC), where each SVM adopts one of three texture features for spoof detection. Experimental results show the superiority of the proposed method compared with other methods in various scenarios. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The multiobjective knapsack problem (MOKP) is an important combinatorial problem that arises in various applications, including resource allocation, computer science and finance. When tackling this problem by evolutionary multiobjective optimization algorithms (EMOAs), it has been demonstrated that traditional recombination operators acting on binary solution representations are susceptible to a loss of diversity and poor scalability. To address those issues, we propose to use artificial neural networks for generating solutions by performing a binary classification of items using the information about their profits and weights. As gradient-based learning cannot be used when target values are unknown, neuroevolution is adapted to adjust the neural network parameters. The main contribution of this study resides in developing a solution encoding and genotype-phenotype mapping for EMOAs to solve MOKPs. The proposal is implemented within a state-of-the-art EMOA and benchmarked against traditional variation operators based on binary crossovers. The obtained experimental results indicate a superior performance of the proposed approach. Furthermore, it is advantageous in terms of scalability and can be readily incorporated into different EMOAs. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The expert systems (ESs) have been developed to facilitate the users their tasks, to enhance the productivity and reduce losses. In order to replicate the behaviour of a human expert, they generate output using their stored knowledge base. In a ES, the accumulation of knowledge from different sources is a very important factor. Nowadays, we are living in a world where two crucial processes need to be perform quickly: decision-making and problem solving. The complexity of the decisions and problems lays on the different factors, situations and data that are involved. The Internet of Things (IoT) has been created to address these situations and helps the users to make correct decisions in real time according to the received data. In the concept of IoT, daily life objects are connected to each other so they can transfer data over the internet without a human to human interaction. The combination of IoT and ESs is a step further for the decision making problem, the received data from the IoT system will be sent to the ES, then the ES will process the information and send the results or decisions to the user. Given that correct decisions-making and problem solving are critical processed, these complex systems need to be tested. Mutation testing, which is a technique used in fault testing, has been examined in a range of studies where different programming languages have been used as well as in IoT expert systems evaluations. However, this technique has not been applied to an Iost often. In this paper, we apply mutation testing using MuEPL to EPL of EsperTech programs in order to simulate the common errors of the developers and to avoid the wrong decisions before moving out to ES in the IoT network.

AB By reducing the gaussianity, Independent Component Analysis (ICA) behaves robustly in segregating individual signals of non-skewed characteristic from a mixed composite signal. In this article, we present a next-generation variant of ICA, especially applicable in the skewed composite signal scenario, applying the Logarithmic transformation on basic ICA, named as Log-ICA. This approach is capable of decreasing overlapping probability densities of the composite signal, which, in turn, extracts more independent components because of reduced gaussianity. Here also we use two different architectures Log-ICA I and Log-ICA II corresponding to two variants of ICA architecture (ICA I and ICA II). We justify the effectiveness of the proposed technique on five separate benchmark face datasets using five classifiers. Out of five face datasets, two datasets contain both visible and thermal face images. Experimental results show that Log-ICA II performs better than Log-ICA I and two variants of ICA for original face images and noise-induced face images. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The recent development in precision agriculture, a large amount of data are generated by site-specific weather stations which will demand a platform for the processing and predictive weather analytics. The sophisticated methodology to solve large amount of data handling problem and process data in a small time is important. In this study, future conditions are predicted from weather stations large data by proposing the predictive approaches based on time series and neural network using MapReduce programming model. We have proposed predictive analytics approaches including the modules, i.e., analysis and decomposition, classification, and prediction. The time series based decomposition approach is proposed to decompose and find out the trend, regular and sophisticated components. The linear components are handled by time series MapReduce based Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (M-ARIMA) model and nonlinear components are handled by M-K-Nearest Neighbors (M-KNN) model. In addition, the MapReduce-based Hybrid Model (M-HM) was proposed which will use the advantages of time series and neural network to increase prediction accuracy. The study verifies the effectiveness of proposed model over the regular and randomness component of the data. The performance measures and statistical test are performed to validate and check data consistency. In addition, excellent speed-up, scale-up, and size up were tested by changing the size of data set. However, when the data size increases, the average execution time is reduced by using the MapReduce-based approach over the multiple-node workers. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, binary variants of the Butterfly Optimization Algorithm (BOA) are proposed and used to select the optimal feature subset for classification purposes in a wrapper-mode. BOA is a recently proposed algorithm that has not been systematically applied to feature selection problems yet. BOA can efficiently explore the feature space for optimal or near-optimal feature subset minimizing a given fitness function. The two proposed binary variants of BOA are applied to select the optimal feature combination that maximizes classification accuracy while minimizing the number of selected features. In these variants, the native BOA is utilized while its continuous steps are bounded in a threshold using a suitable threshold function after squashing them. The proposed binary algorithms are compared with five state-of-the-art approaches and four latest high performing optimization algorithms. A number of assessment indicators are utilized to properly assess and compare the performance of these algorithms over 21 datasets from the UCI repository. The experimental results confirm the efficiency of the proposed approaches in improving the classification accuracy compared to other wrapper-based algorithms, which proves the ability of BOA algorithm in searching the feature space and selecting the most informative attributes for classification tasks.

AB Pairwise preference data is one of several kinds of feedback data that many modern intelligent systems gather and process in order to help people make better decisions. Recommender systems are of main categories of such intelligent systems. An emerging recommendation approach in this domain is Pairwise Collaborative Ranking (PCR) which seeks to learn pairwise preferences of users over items. Current PCR algorithms generally learn latent factors for users and items that are consistent to the ground truth pair wise preferences, instead of directly extracting latent factors for pairwise preferences. Although this is the typical approach for rating oriented recommendation, it does not seem to be the best option for pairwise collaborative ranking. In this paper RBMRank, a novel model-based PCR approach, is introduced, that is designed for recommendation based on pairwise preference data. RBMRank uses the power of the restricted Boltzmann machines to map the entities of the system into dense feature spaces. Its embedding system is able to generate useful representations even when dealing with sparse data sets, that is a very important issue in recommender systems domain. The other important feature of RBMRank is that it is able to extract latent factors for pairwise preferences, instead of items, that allows it to directly predict the unknown preferences of each user. Experimental results on MovieLens datasets show up to 5.9% improvement of accuracy in terms of NDCG@5 and NDCG@10 compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms in the field of collaborative ranking.

AB Feature selection algorithm contributes a lot in the domain of medical diagnosis. Choosing a small subset of genes that enable a classifier to predict the presence or type of disease accurately is a difficult optimisation problem due to the size of the microarray data. The dual task of achieving higher accuracy and a small number of features makes it a challenging research problem. In our work, we have developed a Recursive Memetic Algorithm (RMA) model for selection of genes. It is a variant of Memetic Algorithm (MA) and performs much better than MA as well as Genetic Algorithm (GA). RMA has been applied on seven microarray datasets namely, AMLGSE2191, Colon, DLBCL, Leukaemia, Prostate, MLL and SRBCT. Encouraging results obtained by the proposed model, reported in this article, are biologically validated with the use of Gene Oncology, KEGG pathways and heat maps. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

   preferences; Temporal dynamics; Preference drift
ID RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS
AB In recommender systems, human preferences are identified by a number of individual components with complicated interactions and properties. Recently, the dynamicity of preferences has been the focus of several studies. The changes in user preferences can originate from substantial reasons, like personality shift, or transient and circumstantial ones, like seasonal changes in item popularities. Disregarding these temporal drifts in modelling user preferences can result in unhelpful recommendations. Moreover, different temporal patterns can be associated with various preference domains, and preference components and their combinations. These components comprise preferences over features, preferences over feature values, conditional dependencies between features, socially-influenced preferences, and bias. For example, in the movies domain, the user can change his rating behaviour (bias shift), her preference for genre over language (feature preference shift), or start favouring drama over comedy (feature value preference shift). In this paper, we first propose a novel latent factor model to capture the domain-dependent component-specific temporal patterns in preferences. The component-based approach followed in modelling the aspects of preferences and their temporal effects enables us to arbitrarily switch components on and off. We evaluate the proposed method on three popular recommendation datasets and show that it significantly outperforms the most accurate state-of-the-art static models. The experiments also demonstrate the greater robustness and stability of the proposed dynamic model in comparison with the most successful models to date. We also analyse the temporal behaviour of different preference components and their combinations and show that the dynamic behaviour of preference components is highly dependent on the preference dataset and domain. Therefore, the results also highlight the importance of modelling temporal effects but also underline the advantages of a component-based architecture that is better suited to capture domain-specific balances in the contributions of the aspects.

AB The paper presents an intelligent system to automatically infer trends in the public opinion regarding the stance towards the vaccination topic: it enables the detection of significant opinion shifts, which can be possibly explained with the occurrence of specific social context-related events. The Italian setting has been taken as the reference use case. The source of information exploited by the system is represented by the collection of vaccine-related tweets, fetched from Twitter according to specific criteria; subsequently, tweets undergo a textual elaboration and a final classification to detect the expressed stance towards vaccination (i.e. in favor, not in favor, and neutral). In tuning the system, we tested multiple combinations of different text representations and classification approaches: the best accuracy was achieved by the scheme that adopts the bag-of-words, with stemmed n-grams as tokens, for text representation and the support vector machine model for the classification. By presenting the results of a monitoring campaign lasting 10 months, we show that the system may be used to track and monitor the public opinion about vaccination decision making, in a low-cost, real-time, and quick fashion. Finally, we also verified that the proposed scheme for continuous tweet classification does not seem to suffer particularly from concept drift, considering the time span of the monitoring campaign.

ID CONCEPT DRIFT
AB Learning from ephemeral data streams has garnered the interest of both researchers and practitioners towards adaptive learning techniques. Despite the convincing results obtained thus far, most of the current research still overlooks that the relevance of features may change throughout the learning process. Scenarios where features become - or cease to be - relevant to the learning task are called feature drifting data streams, and the identification of which features are relevant becomes even more challenging when the feature space is high-dimensional. To select relevant features during the progress of data streams, we propose a merit-guided and classifier-independent dynamic feature selection algorithm named Dynamic SymmetriCal Uncertainty Selection for Streams (DISCUSS). We evaluate our proposal on both synthetic and real-world datasets and show that DISCUSS can boost kNN and Naive Bayes classifiers' accuracy rates on high-dimensional data streams, while at the expense of limited processing time and memory space. Finally, the drawbacks of the proposed method are assessed, and possible future works on the topic are also discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID SUPPLIER SELECTION; EXTENSION; ENVIRONMENT
AB Multiple Attribute Decision Making methods have become very popular in recent years and are frequently applied in many real-life situations. The increasing complexity of the analysed decision problems makes it less feasible to consider all the relevant aspects of the problem by a single decision maker. As a result, many real-life problems are discussed by a group of decision makers. In such a group each decision maker can specialize in a different field and has his/her own unique characteristics, such as knowledge, skills, experience, personality, etc. This implies that each decision maker should have a different degree of influence on the final result, i.e., the ranking of alternatives. This means that the weights of decision makers should differ. The aim of this paper is to extend the TOPSIS method to group decision making, using ordered fuzzy numbers. The proposed approach uses TOPSIS twice. The first time it is used to determine the weights of decision makers which are then used to calculate the aggregated decision matrix for all the group decision matrices provided by the decision makers. Based on this aggregated matrix, the extended TOPSIS is used again, to rank the alternatives and to select the best one. A numerical example illustrates the proposed approach. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

ID K-SVD; ALGORITHM; OPTIMIZATION
AB The feed-forward neural network (FNN) has drawn great interest in many applications due to its universal approximation capability. In this paper, a novel algorithm for training FNNs is proposed using the concept of sparse representation. The major advantage of the proposed algorithm is that it is capable of training the initial network and optimizing the network structure simultaneously. The proposed algorithm consists of two core stages: structure optimization and weight update. In the structure optimization stage, the sparse representation technique is employed to select important hidden neurons that minimize the residual output error. In the weight update stage, a dictionary learning based method is implemented to update network weights by maximizing the output diversity from hidden neurons. This weight-updating process is designed to improve the performance of the structure optimization. Based on several benchmark classification and regression problems, we present experimental results comparing the proposed algorithm with state-of-the-art methods. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm offers comparative performance in terms of the final network size and generalization ability. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID EXTREME LEARNING-MACHINE; MATRICES
AB In the world of ubiquitous computing, fuzzy logic has been emerged as an important research area in the field of face recognition (FR) applications. In this paper, a new efficient and advanced method; inspired from interval type-II fuzzy membership concept of fuzzy logic is proposed. The motivation behind our method is to exploit the benefit of an extended interval type-II membership function: a new concept to fuzzy logics; in collaboration with kernel based sparse representation for FR To integrate all the pluton, we propose a method called: extended interval type-II and kernel based sparse representation method (ExIntTy2KBSRM). In our proposed method, first we figure out the measure of participation of individual pixels in identifying face images using a variant of Interval type-II fuzzy logic i.e. extended interval type-II membership function in place of type 1 fuzzy logic. Next, we calculate K nearest neighbor to training specimens using simple Euclidean distance metric for sparse representation of each test specimen as a combinatorial of calculated K nearest training specimens. After this, we do classification based on contribution made by calculated train specimens in representation results. The efficacy and effectiveness of our proposed method is shown based on experiments performed on various standard databases. The experimental results show that our method deal with challenges of face recognition more efficiently as compared to other state of art methods, as it integrates the pluton of two different membership function based extended interval type-II fuzzy logics in collaboration with kernel sparse representation. Also, our experimental analysis tells that our proposed method improves the classification accuracy to 2-10% greater than the other existing relevant methods.
   Impact and significance of the proposed method: The main impact of the proposed method in FR based expert and intelligent systems is that, it considers unseen information available in pixel values of a face image present due to non-linear variations and overlapping of pixels. It also contains the advantage of spatial similar structure information present in face images. This makes the system more effective and efficient in processing face images for FR. Our method also works where Gaussian membership function does not work and discretizes linear and non-linear functions appropriately. Thus, the proposed method is universally applicable to solve more challenges of FR viz. illumination, occlusion, expression etc. and also has application in other areas viz, medical image processing, decision making problems, hand written words recognition, speech processing, watermarking etc. Also, our method makes FR systems computationally more efficient and cost effective by using sparse concept to matrices, which makes system to consume less memory and process data faster.

AB Subsequence matching algorithms have many applications on time-series, such as detecting specific patterns on Electrocardiogram (ECG) and temperature data. To the best of author's knowledge, there are relatively few research studies on time-series fuzzy subsequence matching yet, which better expresses the logic in real life compared to exact subsequence matching. In this paper, we firstly propose Naive Fuzzy Subsequence Matching based on Euclidean Distance (NFSM-ED) and Dynamic Time Warping (NFSM-DTW) for solving fuzzy subsequence matching problem on time-series, which can be treated as a basic benchmark of efficiency and accuracy. Then we extend it to a novel approach called UCR Fuzzy Subsequence Matching (UFSM) algorithm, which is inspired by UCRSuite. Finally, we develop it to Improved Fuzzy Subsequence Matching by kd-tree (IFSM-kd) and R*-tree (IFSM-R*), which can efficiently and effectively perform fuzzy subsequence matching on time-series. Additionally, the experiment results show that IFSM-R* and IFSM-kd are much faster than NFSM-ED, NFSM-DTW and UFSM with nearly no extra memory space required. Furthermore, IFSM-R* supports inserting and deleting indexes compared to IFSM-kd. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE Opinion mining; Sentiment lexicon; Sentiment analysis; Opinion target

AB Sentiment lexicon plays an important role in sentiment analysis system. In most existing sentiment lexica, each sentiment word or phrase is given a sentiment label or score. However, a sentiment word may express different sentiment orientations describing different targets. It's beneficial but challenging to incorporate knowledge of opinion targets into sentiment lexicon. In this paper we propose an automatic approach to construct a target-specific sentiment lexicon, in which each term is an opinion pair consisting of an opinion target and an opinion word. The approach solves two principle problems in construction process, namely, opinion target extraction and opinion pair sentiment classification. An unsupervised algorithm is proposed to extract opinion pairs in high quality. Both semantic feature and syntactic feature are incorporated in the algorithm, to extract opinion pairs containing correct opinion targets. A group of opinion pairs are generated and a framework is proposed to classify their sentiment polarities. Knowledge of available resources including general-purpose sentiment lexicon and thesaurus, and context knowledge including syntactic relations and sentiment information in sentences, are extracted and integrated in a unified framework to calculate sentiment scores of opinion pairs. Experimental results on product reviews datasets in different domains prove the effectiveness of our method in target-specific sentiment lexicon construction, which can improve performances of opinion target extraction and opinion pair sentiment classification. In addition, our lexicon also achieves better performance in target-level sentiment classification compared with several general-purpose sentiment lexicons. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Multi-level thresholding of a gray image is one of the basic operations in computer vision, with applications in image enhancement and segmentation. Various criteria for the selection of threshold level values were proposed. One of these criterion is the Otsu criterion that uses maximization of between-class variance approach. Although applying multi-level thresholding to an image is a straightforward operation, computation of the threshold levels with Otsu criterion is a computationally expensive process. In this paper, we revisit a dynamic programming algorithm that provides exact and efficient solution to the problem and compare it with modern meta-heuristic algorithms. We provide a rigorous proof for the correctness of the algorithm. The algorithm computational cost is linear in the number of threshold levels. We compare the algorithm with state of the art algorithms and verify its superior performance. The experiments show that we could gain speedup up to 2.45 x. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The impact of the horizontal collaboration of logistic providers as upstream supply chain elements is studied in this paper. The logistic providers can be considered as different players and, in order to analyze different types of coalitions by computing the synergy between the players in each cooperative structure, we developed a mixed integer programming (MIP) formulation for a cooperative inventory routing problem (Co-IRP). In this paper, each player has one depot and some retailers, which are considered as its available market. The model will have a many-to-many network structure once a coalition is formed, where a single product from different depots will be delivered to different retailers. We establish a robust version of Co-IRP, which is called Co-RIRP, considering uncertainty in the network. We developed a few metaheuristic algorithms to promote the gained results once MIP is solved. Finally, in order to share the possible cost saving between players and compare the assignments, we applied a few payoff distribution methods. In addition, a comprehensive analysis of example results and some important managerial insights are presented. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Deep learning can be applied in various business fields for better performance. Especially, fashion-related businesses have started to apply deep learning techniques on their e-commerce such as apparel recognition, apparel search and retrieval engine, and automatic product recommendation. The most important backbone of these applications is the image classification task. However, apparel classification can be difficult due to its various apparel properties, and complexity in the depth of categorization. In other words, multi-class apparel classification can be hard and ambiguous to separate among similar classes. Here, we find the need of image classification reflecting hierarchical structure of apparel categories. In most of the previous studies, hierarchy has not been considered in image classification when using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and not even in fashion image classification using other methodologies. In this paper, we propose to apply Hierarchical Convolutional Neural Networks (H-CNN) on apparel classification. This study has contribution in that this is the first trial to apply hierarchical classification of apparel using CNN and has significance in that the proposed model is a knowledge embedded classifier outputting hierarchical information. We implement H-CNN using VGGNet on Fashion-MNIST dataset. Results have shown that when using H-CNN model, the loss gets decreased and the accuracy gets improved than the base model without hierarchical structure. We conclude that H-CNN brings better performance in classifying apparel. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID DIAGNOSIS; STATISTICS; ALGORITHMS
AB This research proposes a novel genetic algorithm-based online gradient boosting (GAOGB) model for incremental breast cancer (BC) prognosis. The development of clinical information collection technologies has brought in increasingly large amounts of stream data for BC research. Traditional batch learning models have shown limitations in: (1) real-time prognosis accuracy from losing the information of incremental changes of a patient's pathological condition by time; (2) high redundancy due to the time required to retrain models every time new data are received. Online boosting is an efficient technique for learning from data streams. However, difficulties in parameter assignment and the lack of adaptiveness for batch learning base learners can degrade the performances of typical online boosting algorithms. The main objective of this research is to propose an incremental learning model for BC survivability prediction. To render a boosting algorithm with superiority in global optimal parameters, the genetic algorithm (GA) is integrated to an online gradient boosting scenario at the parameter selection phase, enabling real-time optimization. To enhance adaptiveness, an adaptive linear regressor is adopted as the base learner with minimal computational efforts, and updated in symphony with the online boosting model. The proposed GAOGB model is comprehensively evaluated on the U.S. National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program breast cancer dataset in terms of accuracy, area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, retraining time, and variation at each iteration. Experimental results show that the proposed GAOGB model achieves statistically outstanding online learning effectiveness. With a highest 28% improvement on testing accuracy over its base learners, outperforming current state-of-art online learning methods, and approximating batch learning boosting algorithms, the GAOGB algorithm validates the impact of parameter, adaptiveness and convergence in devising practical online learning algorithms. The proposed GAOGB model demonstrates potential for practical incremental breast cancer prognosis, promising a combination of training effectiveness and efficiency. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Question Answering (QA) systems help users to find relevant information. However, current QA systems still return several incorrect answers, which decreases the confidence of users in such systems. Some researchers have suggested the inclusion of validation in QA with the purpose of reducing wrong responses and, therefore, improving results. Nevertheless, there has not been a precise study about how validation contributes to QA results. In this paper, we include a new analysis of the impact of validation on QA results. We reuse data from real QA systems and show that validation enables QA systems to reduce incorrect answers and obtain better results. We think this study will allow researchers to develop better QA systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Multimodal biometric systems fuse information from multiple modalities to overcome limitations of individual classifiers. Score level fusion of multiple classifiers can effectively combine information from different modalities. However, most of the multimodal biometric systems are impaired by conflicting classifier scores under dynamic environment, which results in degradation in system's robustness and reliability. To address this, we propose a multimodal biometric system based on an optimal score level fusion model. The key idea of this work is to optimally integrate three complementary biometric traits namely iris, finger vein and fingerprint. For this, individual classifier performance is optimized using evolutionary Backtracking Search Optimization Algorithm (BSA). In addition, conflicting beliefs from individual classifiers are resolved using proportional conflict redistribution rules (PCR-6) to obtain a concurrent solution. The system exhibits optimal behaviour under dynamic environment through boosting or suppression of concurrent classifiers and resolving conflicts among discordant classifiers. The proposed biometric system is evaluated over chimeric multimodal datasets created from benchmark images. On an average, we achieve an accuracy of 98.43% and an EER of 1.57%. The proposed biometric system not only outperforms stateof-the-art techniques but also shows directions towards development of an expert multimodal biometric system. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB We present a strategy for collaborative reasoning and automatic knowledge sharing in which multiple agents discuss about some piece of information until they reach an agreement. A structured argumentation system (DeLP) is used as the underlying knowledge representation and reasoning formalism, allowing agents to contribute to the discussion by posing or rejecting arguments, or objecting to atomic information. In this proposal, in order to be able to represent more general scenarios than other approaches in the literature, agents are allowed to believe in strict information and are allowed to freely join and leave the discussion at any moment. The proposed strategy automatically deals with the conflicts that may arise when agents pose contradictory strict information, which have to be solved to maintain the soundness of the discussion. The operational semantics of the strategy is defined using a transition system to formally characterise the agents' behaviour and to prove its properties. An empirical comparison between the performance of different criteria that the agents can follow during the discussion is presented. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Since 1990, the International Society of Biomechanics (ISB) has made efforts to provide uniformity to motion description. However, the majority of user studies and technological systems that use motion recognition for rehabilitation, such as virtual and augmented reality (VR and AR), do not follows this standard. Typically, VR and AR techniques recognize motion by comparing human joint positions to a pre-recorded movement, direction, or position relative to an interactive object. Aiming to fill a lack of biomechanical reference on joint motion recognition and analysis for rehabilitation interactive systems, this paper proposes a movement description and recognition method following the ISB standard. The developed method aims to provide computational solutions which are clinically relevant and that uses clinical jargon known to the rehabilitation therapists. The proposed method will also allow motion analysis independent of user's height or its position relative to sensor. We conclude this paper by presenting a comparative analysis of the effectiveness of the Kinect sensors (versions 1 & 2) regarding the recognition of patient exercise motions related to the biomechanical standard. Our solution consists of biomechanical motion classification by identifying in which 3D plane the motion occurs. The motion recognition solution also provides patient posture, motion, and information about incorrect exercise performance. The method was developed by first implementing a body representation and Joint Coordinate System based on ISB standard and then motion angle and biomechanical classifications were performed. Specific methods to measure axial rotations were developed inspired by the traditional goniometry strategy. Also, experiments to evaluate if the method is able to classify the biomechanical motions and, thus, detect whether or not they are being performed correctly were performed using both Kinect vl and Kinect v2. Motions were performed in correctly and wrongly to also verify false positives. Each classified motion was performed 100 times: 70 correct repetitions (35 at normal speed and 35 fast ones) and 30 wrong ones (out of their respective plane). The motion recognition method showed good efficacy in classifying the biomechanical motions correctly. Most of motions presented great success rate of recognition. higher than 80%, mainly using a 20 degrees tolerance. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Color constancy algorithm aims to estimate the color of light source. Many of computer vision applications, such as object detection and scene understanding, benefited from this color constancy algorithm. Since the traditional color constancy algorithm uses either a statistical assumption or a trained regression function, none of those methods is universal illuminant estimator. As a solution for this, researchers proposed combination color constancy algorithm that combines the estimate of several statistical or learning based unitary algorithms. Traditional combination method either uses a static weight to combine the estimate of unitary methods or choose a best unitary algorithm for the input image. The former one fails due to the limitation of static weight to correctly reflect the underlying relationship for a wide range of scenes and the second one has the difficulty to train a multi-class model with limited training data. This paper addresses this limitation of combination methods and proposes a hybrid multi-class dynamic weight model with an ensemble of classifiers. The proposed method classifies images into several groups and uses distinct dynamic weight generation model (DWM) for each group. The DWM generates dynamic weight using an image feature that has a correlation with the capability of the unitary algorithm used for combination. Experiments on Gehler-Shi and National University of Singapore color constancy benchmark data set show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

DE Natural language processing; Opinion mining; Bayesian modelling
AB When users express their stances towards a topic in social media, they might elaborate their viewpoints or reasoning. Oftentimes, viewpoints expressed by different users exhibit a hierarchical structure. Therefore, detecting this kind of hierarchical viewpoints offers a better insight to understand the public opinion. In this paper, we propose a novel Bayesian model for hierarchical viewpoint discovery from tweets. Driven by the motivation that a viewpoint expressed in a tweet can be regarded as a path from the root to a leaf of a hierarchical viewpoint tree, the assignment of the relevant viewpoint topics is assumed to follow two nested Chinese restaurant processes. Moreover, opinions in text are often expressed in un-semantically decomposable multi-terms or phrases, such as 'economic recession'.

AB Intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS) is a representative model of fuzzy theory, and it is widely used to deal with fuzzy and uncertain problems in many practical applications. In IFS theory, the calculation of the distance and similarity between IFSs are significant techniques that are effective measurement methods for distinguishing the similarity degree between IFSs, and the two measures can be used in pattern recognition, decision-making and so on. In this paper, a novel similarity/distance measure between IFSs is proposed according to the intersections of the transformed isosceles triangles from IFSs, and the isosceles triangles are placed in a square area; furthermore, the properties of the proposed measure are also analyzed to prove whether the measure satisfies the definition of the similarity/distance measure for IFSs or not. The numerical experiments are implemented to test the validity of the proposed measure; in addition, several pattern recognition and clustering problems are also employed to further demonstrate its effectiveness. The experimental results show that the proposed measure is an accurate and superior measure that can avoid the shortcomings of most existing measures. Finally, the directions for future research of this work are also represented in the conclusion. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) management as one of the most significant management issues has been increasingly spotlighted by the government, companies and customers, over the past years. The primary reasons for this growing attention mainly down to the governments-driven and environmental related regulations which has caused the overall supply cost to reduce while enhancing the customer satisfaction. Thereby, in the present study, efforts have been made to propose a facility location/allocation model for a multi-echelon multi-product multi-period CLSC network under shortage, uncertainty, and discount on the purchase of raw materials. To design the network, a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model capable of reducing total costs of network is proposed. Moreover, the model is developed using a robust fuzzy programming (RFP) to investigate the effects of uncertainty parameters including customer demand, fraction of returned products, transportation costs, the price of raw materials, and shortage costs. As the developed model was NP-hard, a novel whale optimization algorithm (WOA) aimed at minimizing the network total costs with application of a modified priority-based encoding procedure is proposed. To validate the model and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, some quantitative experiments were designed and solved by an optimization solver package and the proposed algorithm. Comparison of the outcomes provided by the proposed algorithm and exact solution is indicative of high quality performance of the applied algorithm to find a near-optimal solution within the reasonable computational time.

AB Service quality is a multi-dimensional construct which is not accurately measured by aspects deriving from numerical ratings and their associated weights. Extant literature in the expert and intelligent systems examines this issue by relying mainly on such constrained information sets. In this study, we utilize online reviews to show the information gains from the consideration of factors identified from topic modeling of unstructured data which provide a flexible extension to numerical scores to understand customer satisfaction and subsequently service quality. When numerical and textual features are combined, the explained variation in overall satisfaction improves significantly. We further present how such information can be of value for firms for corporate strategy decision-making when incorporated in an expert system that acts as a tool to perform market analysis and assess their competitive performance. We apply our methodology on airline passengers' online reviews using Structural Topic Models (STM), a recent probabilistic extension to Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) that allows the incorporation of document level covariates. This innovation allows us to capture dominant drivers of satisfaction along with their dynamics and interdependencies. Results unveil the orthogonality of the low-cost aspect of airline competition when all other service quality dimensions are considered, thus explaining the success of low-cost carriers in the airline market.

AB DNA sequence is a long string and contains some hidden significant genetic information which are considered by biological researchers in different laboratories, comparing genomes, medicine, engineering and etc. Due to ascending growth of DNA researches, users have faced some challenges in some fields like transfer, maintenance and data storage. Due to the large size of such sequences, there is a need to have a lot of space for storage, so a method is needed to reduce the amount of required space. Data compression may be an efficient way to reduce the size of DNA sequences and results in reduced storage space and transfer bandwidth requirements. Some patterns of effectiveness and importance of methods in compressing data can be seen in compressing existed sequences in database, compressing image and video and some standards like DICOM. The proposed algorithm is a hybrid one consisting of 4 phases: in phase 1 it divides the sequences into subsequences and takes a parallel chaos game representation approach, in phase 2 it replaces the high-frequency substrings using a dictionary method, in phase 3 it uses a parallel Hoffman coding approach, and in phase 4 it creates a structure based on Hoffman results. Since the algorithm runs in parallel mode and creates a dictionary for each subsequence, it increases the compression speed. Also due to the fact that CGR provides all possible patterns, there is no need to search for patterns and results in reduced computation complexity and time. Through the use of this method a benchmarked DNA string "MPOMTCG" gained a compression ratio of 1.6. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The pervasive use of electronic health databases has increased the accessibility of free-text clinical reports for supplementary use. Several text classification approaches, such as supervised machine learning (SML) or rule-based approaches, have been utilized to obtain beneficial information from free-text clinical reports. In recent years, many researchers have worked in the clinical text classification field and published their results in academic journals. However, to the best of our knowledge, no comprehensive systematic literature review (SLR) has recapitulated the existing primary studies on clinical text classification in the last five years. Thus, the current study aims to present SLR of academic articles on clinical text classification published from January 2013 to January 2018. Accordingly, we intend to maximize the procedural decision analysis in six aspects, namely, types of clinical reports, data sets and their characteristics, pre-processing and sampling techniques, feature engineering, machine learning algorithms, and performance metrics. To achieve our objective, 72 primary studies from 8 bibliographic databases were systematically selected and rigorously reviewed from the perspective of the six aspects. This review identified nine types of clinical reports, four types of data sets (i.e., homogeneous-homogenous, homogenous-heterogeneous, heterogeneous-homogenous, and heterogeneous-heterogeneous), two sampling techniques (i.e., over-sampling and under-sampling), and nine pre-processing techniques. Moreover, this review determined bag of words, bag of phrases, and bag of concepts features when represented by either term frequency or term frequency with inverse document frequency, thereby showing improved classification results. SML-based or rule-based approaches were generally employed to classify the clinical reports. To measure the performance of these classification approaches, we used precision, recall, F-measure, accuracy, AUC, and specificity in binary class problems. In multi-class problems, we primarily used micro or macro-averaging precision, recall, or F-measure. Lastly, open research issues and challenges are presented for future scholars who are interested in clinical text classification. This SLR will definitely be a beneficial resource for researchers engaged in clinical text classification. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study approaches the determination of nine elements from Brazilian carbonated soft drinks of several flavors and manufactures using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP OES). The concentrations of the elements varied as follows: (in mu g L-1: Cu: 4.00-78.0; Fe: 74.0-506; Mn: 20.0-66.0; Zn: 104-584) and (in mg L-1: Ca: 4.81-16.2; K: 6.73-260; Na: 26.0-175; S: 1.43-5.41; P: 0.186-219). Principal component analysis has shown some tendencies to form two groups according to the drink flavor (orange and cola), but only cola presented a clear and complete separation. Using Kohonen maps, it was observed a tendency to form three flavor groups: (i) cola, (ii) orange and lemon, and (iii) guarana. However, this last tool proved to be more accurate in the groups' formation.

AB The elemental/centesimal composition of dried fruits and capsules containing Goji berries (Lycium barbarum L.) was evaluated by ICP OES after two digestion procedures. Furthermore, phenolic acid compounds and flavonoids were quantified by HPLC-UV-DAD. Precision, accuracy, LOD and LOQ were evaluated. The samples showed similar contents of proteins, lipids and carbohydrates. The metal contents in the samples were found at different levels (minimum-maximum, in mg kg(-1)), as follows: Ca (181.1-200.2); Cu (1.703-2.145); Fe (7.420-7.852); K (81.78-83.59); Mg (92.58-95.12); Mn (1.630-2.570); Na (587.9-590.7); P (3.124-3.360); Se (2.812-3.345); V (0.055-0.062) and Zn (2.325-2.610). Al, As, Ba Cd, Co, Ni, P, Pb, Sb, Sn and Sr showed values below the LOD. Accuracy was assessed by analysis of tomato leaves (NIST 1573a). Eight bioactive phenolic compounds (caffeic, chlorogenic, ellagic, ferulic, gallic, p-coumaric, syringic and vanillic acids) and two flavonoids[(+)-catequin and rutin] were determined, in levels of 55.5-83.700 and 172.3-2982.4 mg kg(-1), respectively.

AB In this work, an analytical method was proposed for the simultaneous determination of mercury and selenium in fish samples using Atomic Fluorescence Spectrometry (AFS). Multivariate designs were performed to evaluate the variables and optimize the best condition of chemical vapor generation (CVG) and simultaneous determination of mercury and selenium by AFS. Fish samples were prepared via acid digestion in digester block with cold finger reflux system, which ensured that the elements were not lost by volatility. The proposed analytical method was validated, and excellent figures of merit have been achieved, such as detection limits of 0.33 and 9.18 ng g(-1) for mercury and selenium, respectively. The method was applied for simultaneous determination of mercury and selenium in canned sardines. Mercury concentrations ranged from 0.057 to 0.203 mu g g(-1) and selenium concentration from 1.76 to 2.21 mu g g(-1), providing a mean molar ratio (Se:Hg) equivalent to 36.

AB This work presents a simple and low-cost analytical approach to detect adulterations in ground roasted coffee by using voltammetry and chemometrics. The voltammogram of a coffee extract (prepared as simulating a home-made coffee cup) obtained with a single working electrode is submitted to pattern recognition analysis preceded by variable selection to detect the addition of coffee husks and sticks (adulterated/unadulterated), or evaluate the shelf-life condition (expired/unexpired). Two pattern recognition methods were tested: linear discriminant analysis (LDA) with variable selection by successive projections algorithm (SPA), or genetic algorithm (GA); and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). Both LDA models presented satisfactory results. The voltammograms were also evaluated for the quantitative determination of the percentage of impurities in ground roasted coffees. PLS and multivariate linear regression (MLR) preceded by variable selection with SPA or GA were evaluated. An excellent predictive power (RMSEP = 0.05%) was obtained with MLR aided by GA.

AB This study deals with the development of a separation and quantification method by high performance liquid chromatography with a diode array detector (HPLC-DAD), for the determination of phenolic acids and methylxanthines in tea (Camellia Sinensis) samples. Six phenolic acids (Gallic, trans-cinnamic, caffeic, ferulic and p-coumaric acids) and two methylxanthines (caffeine, theobromine) were studied, according to the principles of green chemistry, with the goal of comparing teas with different processing level. After development and validation of separation and extraction methods was applied to 11 extracts obtained by infusions of green and black tea samples in commercial areas of the city of Salvador-BA, showing feasible and efficient. Was employed multivariate data analysis and the Tukey test to correlate the chromatographic profile with the different samples. Principal component and analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis were used for the chromatographic analysis, allowing the visualization of two groups, formed by green and black tea samples.

AB This work evaluated the presence of contaminants in stored rainwater in 36 polyethylene tanks installed in two rural communities of the semiarid of Bahia, Brazil. Carbonyl compounds were analyzed by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC-UV), BTEX (Benzene, Toluene, Ethylbenzene and Xylenes) by gas chromatoghaphy (GC-FID), and trace elements by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). Seven carbonyl compounds were quantified including acrolein (< 3-115 mu g L-1), which is considered a potent mutagenic agent, above the potability limit in 75% of the cases. Trace elements such as copper, zinc, barium, aluminum and lead, more frequently found, were also quantified, and lead (< 0,56-99 mu g L-1) was above the tolerable limit for drinking water of 10 mu g L-1 in 73% of the cases. The results show that the stored water in polyethylene cisterns in the Brazilian semiarid region does not present satisfactory conditions for human consumption.

AB Thermal rice oil degradation was evaluated by UV-Vis and NIR in three-way arrays assembled with samples, different temperatures, and the absorbance at different wavelengths by applying PARAFAC chemometric method. The loadings matrix of the mode corresponding to the samples (scores) contains the information related to the samples. The loadings on the temperature mode resemble kinetics profiles. These profiles change with the nature of the component responsible for the factor and evolve with the heating temperature. The loadings on the spectral mode reveal the antioxidants gamma-oryzanoland tocopherol, and oxidation products are the components responsible for the two factors. The results achieved showed that the antioxidants concentration decreases starting at 70 degrees C while oxidation products start to increase more pronounced after 90 degrees C. The proposed method is shown to be a simple and fast way to obtain information about the oxidative stability of rice oils.

AB The fractional factorial and Doehlert designs for optimization of a slurry sampling procedure to determine of nutrients in sugarcane juice by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP OES) were applied. External calibration curves were used for direct analysis of the slurry. This procedure allowed determination of Ca, Cu, Fe, K and Mg with limits of detection (LoD) obtained of 2.0, 0.04, 0.2, 1.0 and 1.5 mg L-1, respectively. The precision was expressed as relative standard deviation (%RSD), being better than 1.4% (n = 3). Accuracy was confirmed by comparison with sample digestion method. The results for analysis of fourteen sugarcane juices samples demonstrated that the nutrients Ca, Cu, Fe, K and Mg have average contents of 108, 0.506, 6.40, 470 and 114 mg L-1, respectively. The proposed analytical method is a good alternative for simultaneous determination of nutrients in sugarcane juice using introduction of slurries and detection by ICP OES.

AB Four species of bivalve molluscs (Anomalocardia brasiliana, Iphigenia brasiliana, Lucina pectinata and Trachycardium muricatum) were collected in the Todos os Santos Bay (TSB), Bahia, Brazil, in order to evaluate As, Cd, Co, Cu, Cr, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Se, V and Zn levels and, consequently, the risk of bivalve mollusc consumption in humans. The samples were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP OES) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) after closed-vessel microwave digestion. The accuracy was confirmed using the certified reference materials of oyster tissue (NIST 1566b) and mussel tissue (NIST 2977), and the results were statistically equivalent to the certified values. Application of principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) showed a tendency to form two groups between samples of Lucina pectinata and Trachycardium muricatum. All species showed As and Cr concentrations higher than the maximum tolerable limit specified in Brazilian legislation.

ID SUGAR-CANE SPIRITS; COMPUTER VISION; CLASSIFICATION; ORIGIN
AB Cachaca is a sugarcane-derived alcoholic spirit exclusively produced in Brazil. It can be aged in barrels made from different types of wood, similar to other distilled beverages. The choice of wood type promotes different effects on color, flavor, aroma and consequently the price of cachaca, favoring fraudulent activities. This paper proposes the simultaneous identification of different wood types in aged cachacas and their adulterations with wood extracts using a digital-image based methodology employing color histograms obtained from digital images associated with pattern recognition methods, without any sample preparation step. Linear Discriminant Analysis, coupled with Successive Projections Algorithm for variable selection (SPA-LDA), obtained the best results, reaching accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity rates higher than 90.0% in the test set. This can be a rapid and reliable tool to prevent fraudulent labeling; ensuring that what is on the label reflects the quality of aged cachacas, affording security to consumers and regulatory agencies.

AB Bee pollen consumption has increased in the last years, mainly due to its nutritional value and therapeutic applications. The quantification of mineral constituents is of great importance in order to evaluate both, the toxicity and the beneficial effect of essential elements. The purpose of this work was to quantify the essential elements, Ca, Mg, Zn, P and K, by diffuse reflectance spectra in the near infrared region (NIR) combined with partial least squares regression (PLS), which is a clean and fast method. Reference method used was ICP OES.
   The determination coefficients for calibration models (R-2) were above 0.87 and the mean percent calibration error varied from 5 to 10%. For external validation R-2 values were higher than 0.76. The results indicated that NIR spectroscopy can be useful for an approximate quantification of these minerals in bee pollen samples and can be used as a faster alternative to the standard methodologies.

LIBS and WDXRF calibration models were built with references values determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP OES) after acid digestion. The calibration models for LIBS and WDXRF were obtained from 28 samples (14 for calibration and 14 for validation). It was possible to implement a validation between LIBS and WDXRF methods for elements Ca, K, Mg and Na. The proposed calibration model obtained using LIBS and WDXRF data presented a good correlation with reference values obtained by ICP OES.

AB A method using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection (HPLC-DAD) was applied after extraction with acidified methanol, to determine 12 bioactive phenolic compounds in the peel and pulp of the mango fruit (Mangifera indica L.) cultivated in the Bahia, state of Brazil. The proposed methodology was previously fully validated and proven successful in the analysis of methanolic extracts of lyophilized samples. The limits of quantification ranged between 0.78 and 3.14 mg L-1 and the individual recovery values obtained for the spiked samples ranged from 80% to 120%. The results were evaluated using PCA and ANN. The results indicate that the fruits are rich in polyphenols, mainly: ellagic acid, gallic acid, rutin and catechin, which contribute to their greater use as functional foods, natural antioxidants and in the pharmaceutical industry, as well as other applications.

AB Extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO) from Mediterranean were analyzed by Ultraviolet-Visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy and Independent Component Analysis (ICA). The use of ICA resolution provided information over dienes (primary oxidation compound), polyphenolic compounds, tocopherol, carotenoids and chlorophylls when EVOO was evaluated by UV-Vis spectroscopy. Based on these data, ICA could be used to determine the contribution of chemical compounds to the composition of EVOO produced in different regions from Mediterranean. The results suggest that the combination of UV-Vis measurements and ICA makes possible the EVOO evaluation, and can contribute to suggesting that a foodstuff comes from an alleged origin. The proposed methodology is a low cost, fast and sample preparation free methodology to highlights the EVOO characteristics produced in the Mediterranean region.

AB A method for simultaneous determination of Fe (232.036 nm) and Ni (232.195 nm) in vegetable oil samples by high-resolution continuum source graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (HR-CS GF AAS) after an acid extraction of the analytes is proposed. In the extraction step, hydrochloric, nitric and acetic acid solutions were tested. The optimization of the procedure was performed by applying Doehlert matrix, and multiple response was used for simultaneous evaluation of the performance of the extraction. The optimum conditions were: extraction time of 17 min, extraction temperature of 39 degrees C and sonication amplitude of 42%, employing 0.5 mol L-1 HCl as the extracting solvent. The limits of quantification were 60 and 160 ng g(-1) for Fe and Ni, respectively. The method was applied to the analysis of vegetable oil samples and the results were compared with a method employing inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP OES).

AB A procedure using ICP OES for sample preparation for the determination of copper, iron and manganese in cashew nuts was developed. Constrained simplex-centroid design was applied in the optimization of the digestion in microwave oven procedure, and the results evaluated from topological maps of the Kohonen network. The best proportion evaluated for the digestion of the sample with HNO3, H2O2 and H2O was 10:45:45 (%). With optimized conditions, the detection limits were 0.63, 4.3 and 0.37 mg kg-1, and quantification 2.1, 14 and 1.2 mg kg-1 for Cu, Fe and Mg, respectively. The precision (% RSD) was 1.84, 2.31 and 2.73, for Cu, Fe and Mg, respectively. The procedure proposed had the accuracy confirmed using NIST 1568b ( at 95% reliability) and was applied in the samples obtaining concentrations in the range of 10.7-19.4, 44.3-67.2 and 11.0-21.4 mg kg(-1) for Cu, Fe and Mg, respectively.

AB This work developed an analytical method to differentiate conventional and omega-3 fat acids enriched eggs by Raman spectroscopy and multivariate supervised classification with Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA). Forty samples of enriched eggs and forty samples of different types of common eggs from different batches were used to build the model. Firstly, gas chromatography was employed to analyze fatty acid profiles in egg samples. Raman spectra of the yolk extracts were recorded in the range from 3100 to 990 cm(-1). PLS-DA model was able to correctly classify samples with nearly 100% success rate. This model was validated estimating appropriate figures of merit. Predictions uncertainties were also estimated by bootstrap resampling. The most discriminant Raman modes were identified based on VIP (variables importance in projection) scores. This method has potential to assist food industries and regulatory agencies for food quality control, allowing detecting frauds and enabling faster and reliable analyzes.

AB Statistical mixture design extraction and fractionation of Mikania plant samples were carried out to quantitatively study seasonal and solvent composition effects as well as their interactions on secondary metabolites. The mixture design consisted of ethanol, acetone, dichloromethane and chloroform solvents and their binary, ternary and quaternary mixtures. Yields were measured for the crude extract and its neutral, organic, basic, polar and fiber fractions obtained with each solvent composition from samples harvested during 2010. Two-way ANOVA found statistically significant seasonal and solvent effects for the crude extract and all the fractions except for the polar fraction solvent. The best solvent extractor depends the harvest season. High crude, organic and polar fraction yields in the summer are correlated with the coumarin UV-vis absorbance at 274 nm. Crude yields of mixtures containing ethanol are correlated with the coumarin absorbances in summer, winter and spring whereas mixtures without ethanol show no significant correlation.

AB This work evaluated the influence of the cooking methods (cooked in a water bath, in a stove, and in a microwave oven) on the mineral composition of mustard leaves (Sinapis alba). So, raw and cooked samples were digested and afterward the elements calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, iron, zinc, phosphor, barium and sulfur were determined using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP OES). The experimental work involved a set of five samples from different locations, processed in triplicates. The results were evaluated employing Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) and Linear Discriminate Analysis (LDA). All techniques showed that the mineral content of the raw and cooked samples in a water bath is different from the samples cooked in stove and microwave oven. Especially for potassium, whose content is strictly controlled for chronic renal patients, this study showed that cooking using microwave oven has the greatest efficiency for reduction.

AB Coffee cup quality, determined by the sensory attributes evaluated by professional tasters, is a decisive factor for evaluating coffee, with the "Specialty Coffee Association of America" (SCAA) classification being nowadays considered the most suitable. Panels of trained coffee tasters are used by the industry to describe and evaluate beverage quality, but those evaluations can be subjective and time demanding. Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of spectroscopy-based methods for establishing parameters of quality in the analysis of food products, including coffee. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of ATR-FTIR and chemometrics to discriminate espresso coffees with different sensory characteristics reported by a panel of coffee tasters. The results showed good consistency among coffee tasters. PLS-DA models based on spectroscopic data were able to classify samples according to sensory attributes, confirming the potential of FTIR and chemometrics in coffee quality evaluation.

AB Lippia alba is a popular Brazilian herb known as 'cidreira' that presents several chemotypes which exhibit different chemical profile and they are widely used as seasonings and traditional medicine. This work describes the seasonal variation of metabolites of polar extracts of carvone and linalool chemotypes, identified by GC-MS analyses of the essential oils. A methodology was elaborated in order to obtain a seasonal variation in the chemical composition of leaf employing HPLC-DAD. Acteoside, isoacteoside, geneposidic acid, 8-epi-loganin, mussaenoside, luteolin 7-O-glucoside, apigenin 7-O-glucuronide and tricin 7-O-diglucuronide have been isolated and identified for validation procedures and chromatographic analysis. Geneposidic acid was presented in all samples, in contrast to the 8-epi-loganin and, mussaenoside which were presented only in the carvone-chemotype. Acteoside was the major metabolite detected from July to November while tricin-7-O-diglucuronide was the major compound in all other months. Besides, phenylpropanoids are predominant in winter and flavonoids in summer season.

AB Two extraction strategies for albendazole, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim, enrofloxacin, oxitetracycline and nicarbazin in egg were optimized for its quantitation by liquid chromatography. First, two designs were built to find out the optimized condition for the air assisted-dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction based on solidification of organic drop: a fractional factorial and a central composite design. The optimum conditions were 1140 mu L of water, 125 mg of ZnSO4, 1175 mu L of acetonitrile, 1200 mu L of methyl alcohol and 740 mu L of propanone, using 1.00 g of homogenized egg and 50 mu L of 1-dodecanol. Second, two designs were also built to optimize the dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction: a central composite design and a mixture design to set the combination of the re-suspended solvents. The optimum conditions were 1840 mu L of acetonitrile and 160 mu L of dichloromethane and the re-suspended mixture consisting in acetonitrile and sodium phosphate buffer 10 mmol L-1 pH = 3.50 (30:70 v/v).

AB Scaffolds with hierarchical structures capable of promoting cells attachment, proliferation and guiding tissue formation have always been one of the major goals in tissue engineering. Here, a macro/microporous silk fibroin (SF) scaffold was fabricated by combining the paraffin sphere leaching and phase separation methods. The scaffolds possess adjustable macro/micro pores size, interconnected pores, high porosity and certain mechanical property. The scaffolds also promoted cell attachment, infiltration and proliferation, which can be an ideal candidate for cell delivery and tissue regeneration. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Amorphisation effect on the surface of SnTe and GeTe samples under low Ar+ ion energy sputtering (160 eV) has been firstly observed. Scanning electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy methods were used for the investigation. Microscope images show that ion bombardment changes significantly the morphology of SnTe and GeTe sample surfaces. Comparative Raman spectroscopy studies of the as-prepared and sputtered surfaces revealed that sputtering changes not only the surface morphology, but also the crystal structure of samples. Due to sputtering, the initial crystalline GeTe sample surface completely changed to amorphous, while the SnTe sample surface changed to a mixed amorphous-crystalline structure. This means that on the surface of IVB group binary tellurides an amorphisation can be evoked by low energy Ar+ ion bombardment, up to a few hundred electron volts energy. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB A new pH fluorescent probe 2,8-(6H,12H-5,11-methanodibenzo[b,f]diazocineylene)-di(o-ethenylpyridine) (TBOP), which attaches electron-accepting pyridine groups into Troger's Base skeleton, was designed and synthesized. Compound TBOP exhibits excellent pH-dependent performance that its blue fluorescence emission can be quenched upon protonation and the fluorescence can be lighted by deprotonation. Accordingly, the color of the solution switched between colorless and yellow. Moreover, TBOP has high sensitivity, good selectivity and large Stokes' shift (121 nm). Such property enables it to work as a fluorescent acidic pH sensor in solution state. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Planar perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted tremendous attention because of their excellent photovoltaic efficiencies and low temperature fabrication. However, most of the PSCs showed low open circuit voltage due to imperfect band alignment between poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene): poly (styrene suffocate) (PEDOT:PSS) and perovskite, which lead to limited performance. In this letter, low temperature solution processed VOx film is used as a hole transport layer (HTL) to modified PEDOT:PSS for inverted PSCs, which could modify the Fermi energy of pristine PEDOT:PSS HTL, resulting in an improved band alignment and increasing open circuit voltage The optimized device shows nearly free hysteresis with maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 14.22%, which shows better stability than the performance of the device based on PEDOT:PSS.

AB Ti-substituted CuGaS2 (Ti-CGS) thin film, a well candidate intermediate band (IB) material, has been successfully synthesized via a well synthetic route by alternate sputtering. The results revealed that the film have a compact morphology and are comprised of a crystalline chalcopyrite single phase Ti-CGS. Due to the presentation of Ti atoms, the IBs were introduced and additional sub-band-edge responses were directly observed in absorption spectroscopy. In the Ti-CGS thin film, except an intrinsic band-edge response observed at 510 nm ('A', 2.31 eV), two distinct sub-band-edge responses are observed at 856 nm ('B', 1.45 eV) and 1418 nm ('D', 0.87 eV). Besides, one weak sub-band-edge responses are found at 1102 nm ('C',1.13 eV), which is in accord with theoretical prediction. The present report might provide a promising fabrication process for discovering the multiple IBs in the Ti-CGS film. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID HALIDE PEROVSKITES
AB Organometallic perovskites MAPbX(3) (MA = CH3NH3 and X = I, Br or Cl) are considered as potential materials for X-ray and gamma ray detection due to its high Z atom, large mobility-lifetime product and growth from solution. However, perovskites with one kind halide own numbers of free charges and yielded unbearable noise current. In this work, we grow perovskite single crystals (PSC) with different halide ratio and find the MAPbBr(2.5)Cl(0.5) PSC shows outstanding performance in electric properties. Through energy dispersive X-ray spectrum, vacancy and excess of Pb is thought as the main cause of free charges. The atomic ratio between halide and Pb as 3 in MAPbBr(2.5)Cl(0.5) PSC and its large resistivity 5.6 x 10(8) Omega cm and 160 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) high mobility are measured. Thanks to the smaller noise current, higher electric field could be established for higher charges collect efficiency. As a result, compared with pristine perovskite single crystals, improved X-ray detection performance is demonstrated. This work provides useful information to achieve high performance X-ray detectors based on organometallic perovskites. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID ADSORPTION
AB This paper describes a simple and effective process for fabricating geopolymer-polymer composite fiber. The fiber is synthesized by mixing geopolymer powder with Polyethersulfone (PES) - N-Methyl-2 pyrrolidone (NMP) solution and the slurry was extruded then transformed into a fiber by phase inversion method. The fiber is constructed of PES and fly ash-based geopolymer (FAG) particles with porous structure. Analysis of the pore structure of fiber revealed that BET surface area is 168.30 m(2)/g. In addition, the adsorption capacity of heavy metal ions on geopolymer composite fiber follows the order of Pb2+ > Cu2+ > Cd2+ > Ni2+. This work provides a convenient, low-cost and environmental friendly adsorbent for removing heavy metal ions from waste water. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB For practical application of Ce material, one-dimensional C/Ce-compound (CeF3 and CeO2) composite materials were successfully designed. Carbon skeleton with unique interconnected porous structure and high specific surface area were manufactured by electro-blown spinning method, using polyvinyl pyrrolidone as the carbon precursor and polytetrafluoroethylene as the pore forming agent. CeF3 and CeO2 nanoparticles were uniformly doped in PCNF framework by in-situ encapsulation and hydrothermal methods, respectively. The porous nanofiber skeleton was beneficial to overcome the agglomeration and recycling problem of Ce-compound nanoparticles. This designed structure provided a promising strategy to ameliorate nanostructure material, suggesting potential application in catalyst and energy storage system. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Legacy tank waste from plutonium production at the Hanford site is planned for vitrification at the Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant (WTP). The accumulation of spinel crystals in the melter, discharge throat and riser is a possible operational concern wherein clogging and/or subsequent failure of the high level waste (HLW) melter may occur. Experiments were conducted in a full-scale, room temperature test platform that is prototypic of the WTP HLW melter to characterize the particle settling in the riser. The experimental system consists of an acrylic discharge riser and throat attached to a feed tank that allows for visual observation of the particle behavior. Silicone oil and magnetite particles were used as simulants for the molten glass and spinel crystals. A set of equations for wall-corrected, cloud settling of particles at low particle concentration is presented that closely matches the experimentally determined settling rate. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB The results of 2D Finite Element thermal simulations of Direct Energy Deposition of a High Speed Steel thick deposit explain the observed microstructural heterogeneities over the whole height of a 36-layer deposit. The Finite Element model is validated by the recorded substrate temperature and the melt pool depth of the last clad layer experimentally measured. The correlation between the computed thermal fields and the microstructures of three points of interest located at different depths within the deposit is carried out. The effect of both the melt superheating temperature and the thermal cyclic history on the carbides type, shape and size is discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The as-prepared products demonstrated novel hollow SnO2 microcubes with side length of 2-3 mu m. Noticeably, the SnO2 cubic surfaces exhibited a hierarchical architecture of well-aligned nanorod arrays. The gas-sensing properties indicated that the nanoarrays SnO2 hollow microcubes possessed superior sensitivity towards ether at the heating voltage of 4.5 V.

AB The method utilizing high-pressure torsion (HPT) processing followed by annealing to fabricate Cu-Al in situ composite with enhanced mechanical properties is presented. The initial sample consists of three metal discs Cu/Al/Cu was processed by HPT (5 GPa, 5 turns). The analyses of the microstructure after HPT carried out by transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy equipped with energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS). After HPT, the development of nanostructure with the mean crystallite size of about 100 nm in the produced sample was revealed with the small presence of the intermetallic phases. Investigation of the kinetics during subsequent annealing at 450 degrees C/30 min showed the in situ formation of intermetallic Al2Cu, AlCu, Al3Cu4, Al2Cu3 and Al4Cu9 phases in the copper matrix which was detected by EDS. The formation of intermetallic phases after annealing was also confirmed by X-ray diffraction. The results showed that microhardness of the composite considerably increases from an initial value of similar to 380 for HPT sample to a saturation value of similar to 900 after annealing.

In this work, we present a simple, potentially scalable, and economically viable method for the preparation of high-quality BP from amorphous red phosphorus. BP was synthesized under low pressure and temperature conditions from red phosphorus via the addition of small quantities of copper, tin, and tin(IV) iodide. Characterization by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectrometry (EDX), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), and Raman spectroscopy were performed to confirm the high quality and purity of the formed BP.

AB Carbon black (CB)/polyamide 6 (PA6)/poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) electrically conductive polymer composites were fabricated by embedding conductive CB/electrospun PA6 fibrous mat into PVA matrix. Here, the electrospun PA6 fibrous network was applied as the skeleton to pre-construct conductive channels by decorating CB particles on the surfaces of PA6 fibers; the PVA was used as matrix to protect the pre-produced conductive network. For the strain sensing performances, a very high gauge factor (GF, 9706.9) has been achieved, showing a large sensitivity. Cyclic tension tests display that the conductive fibrous composite shows distinguishing sensing behaviors towards varying tensile strain. The strain sensor also has excellent repeatability and durability during long-term stretching-releasing cycles. This work provides a facile and novel strategy to develop strain sensors combined with high sensitivity and excellent stability for human health detections. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Adding an eggshell membrane (ESM) template to the solution combustion synthesis of NiMoO4 resulted in the formation of beta-NiMoO4 under mild conditions. It is postulated that the unique nature of the ESM template results in interactions that stabilise this difficult to synthesise form of NiMoO4. The ESM template led to beta-NiMoO4 particles that were nano-wire like in shape and arranged in an open weave structure that significantly enhanced the mesoporosity and conductance of the material. The specific capacitance was measured as 259 F g(-1) in a two electrode system with an energy density of 252.2 W h kg(-1). The results indicate that the use of a fibrous like natural polymeric material as a template stabilises materials in preferred crystal forms and shapes leading to much improved electrochemical performance.

AB Incorporating nano-scale reinforcements onto carbon fiber (CF) surface is a promising approach to enhance the interfacial strength of epoxy composites. Herein, a hierarchical reinforcement (CF/SiO2 / GO) was prepared through deposition silica (SiO2) and graphene (GO) onto CF surface by Layer-by-Layer electrostatic self-assembly (ESA) for the first time. The experimental results confirmed that the SiO2 and GO were successfully assembly, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) indicated a uniformly coverage on the CF surface. After assembly with SiO2 /GO of CF showed the surface roughness and wettability of CF increase obvious, which supplying strong mechanical interlocking between fiber and resin. Meanwhile, the interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) of CF/SiO2 /GO epoxy composites were 46.3% higher than Untreated-CF composites. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The syntheses of sulfonate-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) following or not a pillared strategy using a linear N-donor ligand have been successfully developed. These MOFs based on Co, Ni or Mn present a layered structure separated by a solvent molecule of DMF or by a bridging ligand (4,4' - BiPyridine bpy). Due to the presence of transition metals on the coordination nodes bridged by ligands (bpy), these materials have been tested as negative electrodes materials in a coin cell. It reveals that materials have capacities up to 350 mAh.g (1) and good electrochemical stability over 50 charge/discharge cycles. This strategy may shed light on designing new MOF-based electrode materials with the use of organic ligands structured in a hybrid material. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Due to their superior properties, high-entropy alloys (HEAs) are considered as novel structural materials that can substitute conventional alloys. From the viewpoint of future applications, it is important to explore methods for producing complex shaped and homogeneous HEAs. In this study, laser 3D printing technology is employed to fabricate CoCrFeMnNi HEA. The microstructure and mechanical properties of laser 3D printed HEA are also evaluated. An equiaxed-to-columnar transition structure can be observed in the melt pool of the printed sample. The fine BCC phase is found to distribute at the grain boundaries of the FCC matrix, which is the major phase of the printed sample. The printed HEA exhibits an outstanding combination of high strength and excellent ductility. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB 9-12%Cr martensitic steels are perspective materials for critical components of new high-efficiency power plants working at ultra-supercritical parameters of steam. Addition of 0.2% rhenium in the experimental steel improved the short-term creep strength at 650 degrees C. Comparison of kinetics of tungsten depletion from the matrix in different high-Cr martensitic steels showed that rhenium in the experimental 10Cr-3Co-3W-0.2Re steel did not lead to retaining an increased amount of solute W in the ferritic matrix during both aging and creep at 650 degrees C. At the same time, the precipitation of the high fraction of the fine Laves phase particles provided the effective particle strengthening. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB High-yield porous phosphonated tin oxides (SnEDTMP) were successfully synthesized through a facile hydrothermal route with SnCl(4 center dot)5H(2)O as tin source, ethylene diamine tetra(methylene phosphonic acid) (EDTMP) as the organophosphorus and NaOH as the pH regulator. Without any additive template during synthetic process, the obtained product had a high specific surface area of 377 m(2)/g, which was considered to stem from the aggregation of nanoparticles resulting in sufficient void spaces. It was found that the order of NaOH added during synthetic process could effectively dominate the aggregation of nanoparticles such to form tight or loose accumulation, which was the key to successful preparation of highspecific-surface-area phosphonated tin oxides.

AB Ultra-thin amorphous TbFeCo films with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) are sputtered. The PMA of the alloy films is found to be strongly related to the thickness. A critical thickness is observed to exist, where a transition from a FeCo-dominant to a Tb-dominant configuration occurs. Large variation of magnetic properties is demonstrated for the film in the thickness range across this critical thickness.

AB The nanoscale design of metallic multilayer thin films is one crucial factor that greatly influences the kinetics, often inducing unusual phase transformations. Metastable or amorphous phases may directly form in as-deposited films of certain thicknesses, which is common for Ni/Ti multilayers. Atom probe tomography and X-ray diffraction analyses are performed here to study the interdiffusion and structural changes as a function of the bilayer thickness in Ni/Ti multilayers. The films are deposited by DC magnetron sputtering with near 50:50 compositions. Multilayers with 5 nm bilayer thickness are found to be highly intermixed, with compositions up to similar to 25 at.% for both diffuser metals, inducing amorphization reactions during deposition.

The output voltage and current can reach 8 V and 0.4 mu A, respectively. Likewise, the steady piezoelectric signal can respond to different strain rates. The measurement on human body shows that the piezoelectric composite can be used to capture kinetic energy and monitor limb motion for body sensor network application.

AB In this work, a novel nanofiber composite membrane constituting poly (vinylidene fluoride-co-hexaflu oropropylene)/poly-m-phenyleneiso-phthalamide (PVDF-HFP/PMIA) was successfully fabricated through one-step electrospinning technique. The PVDF-HFP/PMIA nanofibers possessed low average diameter and uniform diameter distribution, which were able to be acted as matrix for gel polymer electrolyte. Significantly, the presence of PVDF-HFP endowed PMIA membrane with considerable high electrolyte uptake and porosity, eminent mechanical strength and remarkable thermal shrinkage resistance. Compared with pure PMIA and polyethylene separators, the PVDF-HFP/PMIA separator obtained higher ionic conductivity, lower interfacial resistance and more stable electrochemical window. The Li/LiCoO2 battery with the prepared separator reflected admirable cycle stability with outstanding first discharge capacity up to 153.8 mAh g(-1) at 0.5C rate and superior capacity retention of 88.75% after 100 cycles.

ID BEHAVIOR
AB Chemical composition of pure titanium, particularly oxygen, severely affects mechanical properties of product. Oxygen refining during electron-beam additive manufacturing (EBAM) of pure titanium products was thermodynamically analyzed. The oxygen concentration of the titanium sample fabricated by EBAM was 0.172%, which was lower than that of the initial titanium powders (0.228%). This was mainly because the TiO2 native oxide layer formed on the initial powders reduced during EBAM, thereby decreasing the oxygen concentration. Analysis of temperature and oxygen partial pressure in the EBAM building chamber confirmed the occurrence of reduction and hence the oxygen refining effect. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Nickel nanowires (NiNWs) were synthesized by a simple hydrazine hydrate reduction method. The morphology of NiNWs was controlled via adjusting the molecular weight and amount of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). To demonstrate practical application, NiNWs filled PVDF (NiNWs/PVDF) film was prepared and measured. The result shows that shielding effectiveness (SE) is up to 43 dB for the film with 9 wt% NiNWs (8.2-12.5 GHz), suggesting its great potential application in EMIS for today electronics.

AB Shape memory driving thickness adjustable graphite (G) micro-flakes@shape memory polyurethane (G@SMPU) sponge was fabricated by two-step dipping separately in G-dispersed aqueous solution and SMPU/THF solution for high-performance microwave shielding. The sponge exhibited an ultrahigh G loading ratio (G/sponge, wt/wt) up to 490 wt%. For the first time, dipping coating of SMPU onto the sponge was proposed, and the obtained G@SMPU sponge exhibited a good recovery effect at least above 90% after thorough compression. And also, the thickness could be adjusted by utilizing its shape memory property. For microwave shielding, G-9@SMPU and G-18@SMPU sponges achieved the shielding effectiveness over 20 and 30 dB, respectively. Moreover, varying thickness or compressing repeatedly even up to 100 times would not obviously decrease the shielding effect of the G@SMPU sponge. This suggests the steady distribution and adhesion of G micro-flakes inside the three-dimensional sponge substrate due to the fixing of SMPU. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The results showed that the continuous release of Ca(OH)(2) from hydrated TCS substrate accelerated reaction of noncovalent self-assembly and covalent polymerization of dopamine and therefore a faster deposition of PDA coating on hydrated TCS substrate. Furthermore, amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) that is the precursor phase of bone-like hydroxyapatite (HA) can rapidly precipitate on the surface of PDA-coated TCS within 5 min in simulated body fluid (SBF).

AB Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) holds promise as an electrocatalyst candidate for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, it is a challenge for MoS2 electrocatalyst to owe simultaneously good electrocatalytic activity and long-term electrochemical stability. Herein, we synthesize MoS2 by a hydrothermal method with the assistance of silicon quantum dots (SiQDs). The resultant SiQDs-MoS2 possesses a 3D framework structure with dense mesoporous whilst contains 1T and 2H phases. Consequently, SiQDs-MoS2 elecctrocatalyst presents good electrocatalytic activity (overpotential of 200 mV and Tafel slope of 60 mV dec(-1)) and acceptable electrochemical stability (72 h). Integration of the mesoporous 3D structure and the 1T/2H multiphase can contribute to the excellent electrocatalytic performance. This work provides insights into the design and development of the high-performance electrocatalysts. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Metal-organic framework (MOF)-derived carbon-coated metal sulfides are a popular research area for energy storage, owing to their highly reactive nature and universal electrochemical activity. A simple and efficient method for the preparation of carbon-coated copper sulfide via a calcining-hydrothermal process using an MOF template is presented in this paper. The transmission electron microscope (TEM) imaging indicates that the cobble-like Cu7S4 nanopolyhedra are similar to 100 nm in size, and are interconnected by amorphous carbon.

AB In this study, the oxidation behavior of a supercooled Ti16.7Zr16.7Hf16.7Cu16.7Ni16.7Be16.7 HE-BMG was investigated. The mass gain of specimens during oxidation is very limited, and the maximum value is lower than 0.08 x 10(2) g/cm(2) after two hours of insulation. With the insulation duration prolonging, the mass gain decreases, indicating that the oxides formed are not stable and could decompose after long-term heating. Meanwhile, the oxidation kinetics doesn't follow the parabolic rate law, indicating that it is not a diffusion-controlled process. Even for specimens oxidized at 713 K for 120 min, they are still fully amorphous. No surface precipitates, as well as continuous oxide scale structures, are formed even after oxidation for 120 min at 753 K. Therefore, it is indicated that this HE-BMG has strong thermal stability and oxidation resistance, which is much promising for thermoplastic forming. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   roll-bonded for E-mobility
SO MATERIALS LETTERS

DT Article
DE Texture; Al/Cu bimetal; Cold roll bonding; ODF; EBSD; Crystallography
ID STRENGTH
AB Cold roll-bonded Al/Cu bimetal has been widely used in heat sinks for main converters in E-mobility. The development of textures in the interfacial zone of cold roll-bonded Al/Cu bimetal was investigated with the help of orientation distribution function (ODF) analysis based on the FEG-SEM/EBSD technique. The present results show that the texture development of the cold-rolled Al strips can be represented by an alpha-fibre shift approaching the bonding interface. Cold rolling of Cu strips in the bonding zone splits Goss {1 1 0}<0 1 0> and increases the intensities of metastable T {1 1 2}<1 3 1> texture components. By approximating the bonding interface, T components dissolve and both alpha- and gamma-fibre sharpen. The intensities of the approx. 40 degrees <1 1 1> pair, Cu {1 1 2}<1 1 1> and RC {1 0 0}<0 1 1>, increase significantly. The strong bonding of the bimetal can be attributed to the strain-induced formation of ultrafine grains during severe plastic deformation at the bonding interface without recourse to concepts such as 'diffusion' or Intermetallics'.

AB In this paper, BN-SiO2 porous ceramics with high porosity have been successfully fabricated using bottom-up digital light processing (DLP) stereolithography and pressureless sintering. The phase composition, microstructure, compressive strength, dielectric properties and porosity of the porous material were investigated. The results show that the skeleton of the porous material was composed of h-BN, and the silica was 'coated' on the surface of the h-BN particles. The dielectric constant, dielectric loss, compressive strength and porosity of the material were 1.41-1.45, 1.85 x 10 (3)- 1 .93 x 10 (3), 11.2 MPa, 77.2%, respectively.

AB A uniform, fine-grained microstructure is attained by stress relaxation (SRT) method in Ti-6Al-4V alloy subsequent to hot compression (HC) executed at the temperature of 900 degrees C and a strain rate of 10(-3) s(-1) to a 50% height reduction. The pronounced SRT-induced alpha grain spheroidization and texture weakening is proposed. It is found that the spheroidization of the initial coarse forging state microstructure is obvious, and texture has weakened substantially after HC/SRT. In addition, the crystal structure of alpha phase is closer to the ideal crystal structure of alpha-Ti after SRT. The HC/SRT process is mainly governed by continuous dynamic recrystallization and dynamic/static spheroidization. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The structure and magnetic properties of Pt/LaMnO3 bilayer film grown on (0 0 1) MgO substrate have been studied. Structural investigations demonstrate that the bilayer film is well epitaxial and possesses high-quality growth. Magnetic measurements suggest that besides anti-ferromagnetic (AFM) state, unexpected ferromagnetic (FM) behavior is also observed clearly in the Pt/LaMnO(3 )bilayer structure. Moreover, exchange bias (EB) can also be found in the bilayer due to the formation of FM phase and the magnetic coupling between FM and AFM states. These interesting results provide a hopeful guidance for tuning the structure and magnetic properties of the strong-correlated materials. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The obtained polymers have high surface area (755 m(2) g(-1)) and superior thermal stability (their initial decomposition temperature under N-2 condition could reach to 400 degrees C). In addition, the polymers show ultra-high chemical stability (no apparent decomposition in organic solvents for more than 96 h). At 1.0 bar (273 K), their uptake of CO2, N-2, CH4, C2H2 and C2H4 could reach to 11.0 wt%, 1.5 wt%, 6.2 wt% and 7.2 wt%, respectively. Moreover, they also can absorb a large amount of vapor molecules at 298 K, with the largest values up to 232 mg g(-1) (benzene), 196 mg g(-1) (cyclohexane) and 169 mg g(-1) (hexane) when P/P-0 = 0.8. The adsorption selectivity for CO2/N-2 is 42.6 and for CO2/CH4 is 4.25. These combined properties render the synthesized polymers an attractive candidate as chemical stable adsorbents for practical use in gas storage, gas separation and pollutant vapor adsorption.

AB Organo-lead halide perovskites, specifically methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3), has grown to be promising material for a wide array of photovoltaic applications. However, perovskite still lacks in its long-term stability and is sensitive to decomposition via moisture. This work investigates the integration of multiple polymer coatings that have the potential to improve the air stability of the perovskite. The investigated polymers include poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), poly vinylpyrrolidone (PVP), and sodium polyacrylate (NaPA). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was able to confirm the morphology of the perovskite and areas of degradation. In addition, X-ray diffraction (XRD) study reveals that the perovskite coated in the PMMA remains the most efficient polymer coating among the rest of the studied polymers. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar (SHPB) was used to apply load at room temperature and the effect was characterized with the help of analyzing tools. Results ended up with the conclusions that under high strain rate loading, omega phase formation arose when two adjacent beta planes (1 1 0)(beta) in (1 1 1)(beta) direction covered 1/6th distance of total separating distance between planes and deformation through mechanical twinning occurred when dislocations could not match superimposed strain rate.

AB Herein, a hierarchical MoS2@3D-Ni-foam was successfully evolved using in situ solvothermal method as electrode materials for energy harvesting applications. The assembled symmetric supercapacitor device illustrates high specific capacitance (38.9 F g(1)) in a wide potential region of 1.0 V. Furthermore, outstanding stability was demonstrated to have similar to 81.5% capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles and similar to 70.3% capacitance retention after smashing accelerated aging test for 150 h, respectively. Simultaneously, a successful blue LED demonstration for SSC device supports practical operation and its impact with low leakage current and nailing self-discharge characteristics.

AB Distinctive Ag/ZnWO4/WO3 composite nanofibers have been successfully synthesized by a simple electrospinning method followed by subsequent annealing treatment. The as-prepared composite nanofibers are systematically characterized by SEM, XRD, XPS, UV-vis DRS and PL spectra. The photocatalytic activity of Ag/ZnWO4/WO3 composite nanofibers to the degradation of Methyl Blue (MB) is evaluated under UV-vis light irradiation. The result shows that the photocatalytic degradation rate of Ag/ZnWO4/WO3 composite nanofibers reaches to 94% within 80 min, which is higher than that of single WO3 nanofibers and Ag/WO3 binary composite nanofibers. The enhanced photocatalytic efficiency of Ag/ZnWO4/WO3 composite nanofibers is attributed to the synergistic effect of three different activated materials. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID OXIDE
AB Lactic acid in liquids is generally detected by electrochemical sensors. In this research, for the first time, a gas sensor is reported which is sensitive to the lactic acid vapor. This polypyrrole-based polymer gas sensor is fabricated using the chemical polymerization method and the sensitivity of the sensor is evaluated at five different concentration levels in the range of 2%-10%. It is presented that the corresponding calibration curve is linear in this range. Moreover, the repeatability of the sensor response is investigated by carrying out several experiments at a constant concentration. Analyte examination of the proposed sensor is performed by exposing ammonia and lactic acid vapor and due to high selectivity of the sensor, its resistance changes at different directions. Unlike to reducing gas such as NH3, the sensor resistance increases at lactic acid exposure. This single-sensor gas device is prone to be applied as a potential electronic nose for sweat recognition usages. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Gaseous detonation synthesis of Co@C nanoparticles/CNTs materials
SO MATERIALS LETTERS

DT Article
DE Carbon materials; Co@C; Carbon nanotubes; Gaseous detonation; Raman
AB Co@C/CNTs magnetic carbon nanomaterials were fabricated by a gaseous detonation method with cobalt (III) acetylacetonate (Co(acac)(3)) as precursor and a mixture gas of hydrogen and oxygen as explosion source. The current work investigates how proportion of oxygen in the mixture gas affects the morphologies, phases, and degree of graphitization of Co@C/CNTs nanomaterials. The characterization of transmission electron microscopy indicates that the samples were consisted of core-shell nanoparticles and nanotubes, and the proportion of oxygen had little influence on the morphologies of the samples. X-ray diffraction and Raman spectra analysis demonstrate that the core-shell particles and nanotubes were Co@C and CNTs, respectively. The cobalt nanoparticles generated from the decomposition of Co(acac)(3) would be oxidized to CoO when the proportion of oxygen was greater than 50% in the mixture gas. Though the degree of graphitization of Co@C/CNTs nanomaterials was little affected by the proportion of oxygen, the particle size of Co@C increased with the increase of the proportion of oxygen in the mixture gas, simultaneously, the carbon matrix was decreased.

AB To produce high performance optoelectronic devices, ternary alloys prepared by indium (In), antimony (Sb), tin (Sn) and sulphur (S), the InxSn1-xS2 and SbxSn1-xS2 (x = 0, 0.05, 0.15), are exploited for their application in moderately fast photodetection. The single crystals of InxSn1-xS2 and SbxSn1-xS2 (x = 0, 0.05, 0.15) alloys are grown by direct vapour transport technique. The photodetectors based on single crystals are examined for 670 nm illumination having power intensity of 3 mW/cm(2). For quantitative analysis, the typical detector parameters such as photo-responsivity, specific detectivity and external quantum efficiency are calculated. The improvement in photodetection with significantly enhanced detector parameters and fast a response is realized due to doping in SnS2. The highest responsivity of 15.48 mA/W with response time of 240 ms is achieved in Sb0.15Sn0.85S2 alloy. The present findings of enhanced photodetection due to alloy engineering can be of great advantage in intended applications of these compounds in the field of optoelectronics. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB The effect of Sn orientation on thermomigration was investigated in Cu/Sn2.3Ag/Ni microbumps with diameter of 20 mu m. Results showed that anisotropic diffusion of Cu in Sn grains affected both formation rates and locations of Cu6Sn5 intermetallic compounds (IMCs). Rapid growth of Cu6Sn5 IMCs at the coldend interface was observed when the c-axis of Sn grains was parallel to the temperature gradient. In addition, diffusion of Cu atoms was blocked by a Sn grain with a high angle between the Sn c-axis and the thermal gradient, resulting in formation of Cu6Sn5 IMCs near the grain boundary inside the solder.

AB Graphene-PbSe Schottky photodiodes were constructed by transferring a monolayer graphene sheet onto the surface of PbSe thin films. In order to improve the device performances, oxygen sensitization of PbSe was adopted in the fabrication process. Responsivity and detectivity of the device fabricated with pristine PbSe were 6.2 mA/W and 2.4 x 10(11) cm Hz(1/2)/W under zero bias. Responsivity and detectivity of the device fabricated with sensitized PbSe were 67 mA/W and 6.8 x 10(12) cm Hz(1/2)/W under zero bias. Significant increase in both responsivity and detectivity confirmed the great impact on device performances introduced by the oxygen-sensitization of PbSe. With a response time of millisecond level, outstanding photoresponse along with fast response speed were achieved in as-fabricated graphene-PbSe Schottky photodiode.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB Considerable efforts have been made to tailor the crystalline structure and morphology of tungsten oxide. The activity of tungsten oxide was not only associated with the geometrical structure of the catalysts but also determined by the active surface. In this work, WO3 nanocuboids were fabricated through hydrothermal treatment of commercial WO3 with the aid of H2O2. It was found that WO3 center dot 0.33H(2)O nanocuboids were formed at the initial stage and vanished with high temperature; while WO3 nanocuboids were produced at 240 degrees C. Experiments revealed that WO3 nanocuboids possessed much more amounts of coordinative unsaturated W sites than the WO3 center dot 0.33H(2)O nanocuboids. Due to the unsaturated coordination environment, the WO3 nanocuboids show a higher photocatalytic activity in the methylene blue degradation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Expanding the functionality of electronic materials is often reliant on the attachment of organic molecules to the surface. In this study, several methods for passivating the surface of semipolar (10-1-1) GaN with different chemistries were examined; this included simple physisorption, in-situ functionalization using phosphonic acids, and a two-step carboxylic acid attachment with a peroxide pretreatment. The binding of a variety of different organic adsorbates on semipolar substrates was quantified using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Our results confirm binding at the organic-inorganic interface through the presence of amine/amide species on the surface. The wide variety of organic molecules, and their binding to inorganic electronic materials, can be exploited to impart specific functionalities in technologies spanning fields of energy, biomedical science, and chemical sensing.

AB In the present study, we report the synthesis of porous graphitic carbon sheets (GCS) from tissue paper by in-situ chemical activation process. The resulting GCS material characterized with high graphitic structure and high specific surface area (1684 m(2) g(-1)). When GCS-2 electrode tested for supercapacitor application, it delivers a high specific capacitance of 212 F g(-1), high capacitance retention of 85% at high current density of 50 A g(-1) and outstanding cyclic stability (90% capacity retention after 10,000 cycles). The fabricated supercapacitor cells were also demonstrated for lightening 40 LEDs. The high electrochemical performance of GCS can be attributed to the high specific surface area, large pore volume and graphitic nature of the carbon. Thus, the simple and unique strategy employed in the present study can be extended to synthesize carbon materials from other economic carbon precursors suitable for other energy storage applications.

AB We present an electron beam (E-beam) pre-treatment technique as a mean to crosslink polyethylene (PE) thin film for fabricating carbon nanosheets (CNSs) with improved transparency. In a previous study, we demonstrated successful conversion of innately non-carbonizable PE into transparent CNSs through thermal oxidative stabilization. Unlike other studies about CNSs fabrication using pricey precursors, PE has strong merits because it is the cheapest and the most abundantly used plastic. However, transparency and uniformity of CNSs from PE were not desirable as transparent electrode. Here, by adopting E-beam irradiation as a pre-treatment process before thermal stabilization, we could enhance the transparency and electrical property of PE derived CNSs so that they can be effectively utilized as transparent conducting electrode.

The lower O content powder fed into the laser molten pool forms an alloy steel without porosity but with higher austenite volume fraction, which leads to significant increases in both tensile strength and ductility.

AB Transparent Silver nanowire (AgNW) electrodes have been widely explored in many applications as a promising alternative to relatively expensive indium tin oxide (ITO). For these applications, high contact resistance at the junctions of AgNWs is a main problem to be solved. In this letter, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs)-self-assembled method has been demonstrated to improve the optoelectronic performance of AgNW films. The sheet resistance of this novel AgNW film is measured as low as 13.2 Omega/sq, and the transmittance is high to 86.1%. Self-assembled AuNPs can enrich the percolation paths between AgNWs with negligible loss of optical properties, thereby realizing the excellent optoelectronic performance of AgNW films. Moreover, no extra post-treatment procedures are needed for the fabrication process. All these advantages indicate this method has great potentials for achieving high performance transparent electrodes in emerging optoelectronic devices. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Xerogels are attractive candidates for scaffolds in tissue engineering and drug delivery. Polyvinyl alcohol xerogels are extensively used for biomedical applications owing to their ease of synthesis, biocompatibility and biodegradability. However, these materials are challenged in terms of their weak mechanical properties and structural instabilities. This work is aimed to look into the morpho-mechanical response of transversely isotropic freeze-dried PVA xerogels under mechanical compressive loads. Microstructurally aligned PVA xerogels are synthesized using unidirectional freeze-drying technique. Uniaxial compressive tests are performed alongside viscoelastic characterization. The effect of mechanical compressive loads upon the xerogel microstructure is studied. Microbuckling of material fibers, creasing and wrinkling of the bulk xerogels are some of the microstructural and surface instabilities discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Novel hybrid nanofibrous polymer electrolyte with high ionic conductivity and excellent electrochemical performance is developed by two step hydrothermal and electrospinning process. As-synthesized silver doped titania (Ag-TiO2) nanoparticles were incorporated in electrospinning solution of poly(vinylidine fluoride) for the preparation of Ag-TiO2/PVdF nanofibers. As-fabricated Ag-TiO2 /PVdF nanofibers have been characterized by scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. Ag-TiO2 nanoparticles incorporated PVdF has advantages of both large surface area of nanoparticles and interlaying porous structure of nanofibers which is desirable for stable performance of battery. The prepared cell LiFePO4/Li with electrolyte Ag-TiO2/PVdF delivered excellent cyclic stability with high discharge capacity and coulombic efficiency of 100% after 50 cycles at 0.1 C as compared that of pure PVdF and TiO2/PVdF electrolytes. The hybrid Ag-TiO2 /PVdF polymer electrolytes are expected to be a promising candidate for lithium ion battery. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Hollow nanofibers of pure and In-doped LaFeO3 were fabricated via electrospinning followed by calcination and characterized by various techniques. The results indicated that In element was successfully doped in LaFeO3 lattice and the surface roughness was increased with the increase of In content. The gas sensing test showed that the sensor based on In-doped LaFeO3 hollow nanofibers exhibited high response value at the operating temperature of 100 degrees C with fast response/recovery time to formaldehyde, and the detection limited can be as lower as 1 ppm. Due to these excellent sensing performances, In-doped LaFeO3 hollow nanofibers could be an effective candidate for the fabrication of formaldehyde sensors. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Zeolite X (ZX) was synthesized by diatomite in a water system, and then the synthetic zeolite was modified by thiourea (TU). The synthetic and modified ZX were characterized by XRD, FT-IR, TG/DTA, elemental analysis (CHNS), FE-SEM, EDX, elemental mapping and N-2 adsorption/desorption isotherms, respectively. All the results confirmed that the TU molecules were loaded onto both the exterior and interior surfaces of ZX during the modification process. Compared to the raw ZX, the modified ZX has a higher removal capacity in the Cd(II) removal experiments. In ZX-TU sample, removal of Cd(II) takes place via ion exchange and complexation processes. The maximum adsorption capacity is 92.47 mg/g at 25 degrees C. This cost-effective zeolite can be a functional material for heavy metal removal. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We report on the influence of the disorder and stoichiometry in the resulting superconducting critical temperature of gamma-Mo2N thin films. Initially, three films (with T-c values of 7.6 K, 6.8 K and 6 K) were grown at room temperature by reactive sputtering, on Si (1 0 0) using different N-2/(Ar+N-2) mixtures. The influence of the thermal annealing up to 973 K and irradiation damage produced by 1 MeV Zr+(fluence up 2 x 10(14)cm(2)) is analyzed. The T-c of pristine films remains unchanged for increasing irradiation doses up 2 x 10(14)cm(2). The T-c for annealed films decreases close to the value expected for bulk samples (approximate to 5K) for increasing the annealing temperature. Successive irradiations of the annealed films tend to increase their T-c up to its initial values (before annealing). The results indicate that the T-c in nanometric grain size gamma-Mo2N thin films is affected by both nitrogen stoichiometry and disorder at the atomic scale. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Biosynthesis of nanoparticles using plant extracts is gaining importance in biomedical applications because of their unique properties. The present study was aimed to investigate the novel use of ethanolic extract of Centella asiatica (CA) whole plant to synthesize iron oxide nanoparticles (CAIONPs) by reducing ferrous and ferric chlorides. FTIR of CAIONPs showed a coating of phytochemicals present in the ethanolic extract of CA indicating possible role as capping and efficient stabilization of the CAIONPs. The XRD confirmed the crystalline structure of CAIONPs with an average crystalline size of 15.2 nm, and found to be spherical in shape from SEM and TEM images. From VSM, superparamagnetic nature with a saturation magnetization of 13.8 emu/g was observed. Swiss albino mice treated with CAIONPs at 2000 mg/kg b.w showed no mortality and signs of toxicity during the treatment period. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We argue that the ground state energy distribution function of the subsystem of localized charge carriers in valence fluctuating semiconductors is qualitatively different from that for conventional semiconductors at T = 0 K. As follows from our analysis, both occupied and unoccupied sites can be found above as well as below the Fermi level in the ground state as a consequence of dynamical changes of impurity energies due to valence fluctuations. Such anomalous energy distribution of charge carriers sheds new light on interpretation of experimental results of valence fluctuating semiconductors, e.g. SmB6 and YbB12. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Developments of highly efficient catalysts for hydrocarbon fuel conversion have a critical importance for the solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) technology and hydrogen production. In this work, a series of catalytic monoliths made of porous Ni ribbons with various NiO-MgO loadings were prepared via impregnation with the metal acetates and calcination. The catalysts were tested for the partial oxidation of methane under adiabatic conditions without inlet flow preheating at air excess factors, O-2/(2 center dot CH4), varying in the range 0.3-0.4. When NiO-MgO loading increases, the inlet hot spot temperature was found to exhibit minima reflecting changes of the CH4 reforming rate-determining factors in the catalyst frontal layer. A model describing this unusual phenomenon in terms of the volumetric activity and gas permeability of the porous catalysts, was proposed. The model was validated using experimental results of the catalytic tests, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and mercury porosimetry. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The Pt modified ultrafine WO3 (Pt/WO3) nanofibers with average diameter of 70 nm, showing excellent photoelectrochemical properties have been successfully prepared via a simple two-step technique. Pt/ WO3 nanofibers with various Pt contents exhibit the excellent photocatalytic activity for Rhodamine B (RhB), better than pure WO3 nanofibers, which can be ascribed to the synergistic effect arising between Pt and WO3. Simultaneously, these highly composition-dependent with Pt/WO3 nanofibers shows the optimized photodegradation efficiency. 1%-Pt/WO3 nanofibers provide the enhanced photodegradation efficiency (93.7%) under the visible-light irradiation for 140 min. Based on the density functional theory, the first-principle calculations are performed to further explore the synergistic effect, electronic structure and photocatalytic mechanism of the as-prepared photocatalysts. This design opens up further opportunities for improving photocatalysts and understanding for the optimization of photocatalytic activity of these unique materials. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Furthermore, high temperature/pressure treatment can markedly reduce the semiconductor-metal (S-M) transition pressure to around 1.5 GPa.

TI Ultrasonic Assisted Pressureless Sintering for rapid manufacturing of
   complex copper components
SO MATERIALS LETTERS

DT Article
DE Copper; 3D printing; Ultrasonic; Metals and alloys; Sintering
AB Copper has been used in several applications due to high electrical as well as thermal conductivities and good corrosion resistance. The complex customized copper components are difficult to manufacture by metal 3D printing techniques due to high reflectivity and low laser absorption. In the present study, a novel rapid manufacturing method is introduced by incorporating Ultrasonic Assisted Pressureless Sintering (UAPS) and 3D printing. The mechanical and electrical characterizations of the fabricated samples were done with and without ultrasonic assistance. The ultrasonic waves provided the cyclic contact between the metal particles and increased the local temperature to obtain better diffusion. Hence, the powder was homogenously mixed during sintering and has low surface porosity, resulting in high relative density, hardness and electrical conductivity. In addition, the XRD patterns revealed the purity of the fabricated specimen without any contamination residue. The developed methodology can be used to fabricate near net shape complex copper components. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Recycling is a key environmental issue due to the decrease in global natural resources and constant increase of solid wastes. In this context, we used vitrified bottom ashes from municipal solid waste incinerators as a starting material to produce porous ceramics by employing inorganic salts as foaming agents. These ceramic foams, consolidated through a process of sinter-crystallization, exhibited a three-dimensional network of open pores (total porosity 64 vol%, mean pore size 292 mu m) and a compressive strength of similar to 2 MPa. The thermal conductivity (similar to 0.13 W/mK) showed promise for the potential use of these foams as thermal insulating materials. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Solution-processed organic field-effect transistor (OFET) has great potential in detecting various hazardous gases including nitrogen dioxide (NO2). To overcome the bottleneck of weak gas adsorption/interaction capability in single-semiconductor sensing layer, semiconductor composites are used to enhance the sensing response. Here, we report an OFET-based NO2 sensor whose active layer consists of diluted poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) with poly[N,N'-bis(4-butylphenyl)-N,N'-bis(phenyl)benzidine] (poly-TPD). Due to the site-increase effect induced by phase segregation, the 90% diluted device possesses a more than 3-fold enhancement of current responsivity. Furthermore, when the gate voltage is switched from -40 V to 0 V, this device embodies 4.6-fold and 43.6-fold improvements at 0.3 ppm and 30 ppm, respectively. Meanwhile, decent selectivity, environmental stability and an excellent limit of detection of 242.6 ppb are realized. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE Solar energy; Manufacturing; Flexible substrates; Chemical sintering
AB Colloidal TiO2 films have been prepared using a binder-free aqueous paste with Degussa P25 and hexafluorotitanic acid (H2TiF6), which was optimised for different substrates. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) fabricated using this paste were sintered at (ca. 393 K) and efficiencies (eta) of 3.0, 4.2 and 6.1% were measured for devices using titanium foil (ca. 1 mm thickness), indium-doped tin oxide on polyethylene terephthalate (ITO-PET), and for co-sensitized devices on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrates, respectively. Electrochemical impedance measurements show that the charge transport resistance is less consistent for devices fabricated at low sintering temperature (ca. 393 K) by comparison to devices sintered at 773 K. These measurements correlate with the increased variation in device efficiency (eta) for low temperature sintered DSSC devices. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Secondary phases precipitating after aging treatment in Cu-Ni-Si alloy will influence the texture of the copper alloy. The texture and the second phase characteristics under different aging processes were investigated. The results show that the strength of copper texture {2 1 1} < 1 1 1 > and Goss texture {0 1 1} < 1 0 0 > decreases gradually and the strength of cubic texture {0 0 1} < 1 0 0 > increases when the aging temperature increases. The second phase Ni2Si gradually accumulates as the aging temperature rises, mainly in spheres and squares, and influences the strength of the texture through the effect on distortion of the surrounding area.

AB The aluminium foam sandwich (AFS), prepared through the traditional adhesive or brazing methods, usually exhibits a low flexural strength due to the poor combination among the face sheets and the aluminium foam core. In this work, a new method, named friction stir welding (FSW), was utilized to fabricate AFS. The results demonstrated that the joining of the face sheets and aluminium foam was achieved through the plasticized metal flow. In addition, the AFS prepared through FSW possessed high flexural strength and impact resistance, as well as good sound absorption and reduction performance. This demonstrated that the FSW was a good method to prepare AFS. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Solution-based deposition techniques are emerging as an efficient route for low-cost photovoltaics (PV). We report deposition of tin sulphide (SnS) nanostructures (NS) from a simple, mechanochemically prepared precursor solution (PS) bath. Initially, to check the suitability of PS, SnS NS particles have been synthesized at low-temperature and deposition time in three atmospheres: air, vacuum, argon. In air atmosphere, spherical shaped particles of size similar to 300 nm have been grown. In argon and vacuum atmospheres, the particles show layered growth with few agglomerated bunches. Shiny, adhesive films of NS SnS have been deposited at room temperature (R.T.), 40 degrees C and 50 degrees C. X-ray diffractogram shows the NS belong to orthorhombic SnS phase. Scanning electron microscopy reveals these nanostructures are nanoflakes (similar to 30 nm), nanostrands (similar to 20 to 50 nm) and nanopetals (similar to 100 nm) formed at different temperatures. The RMS roughness of films has been reported. The optical energy bandgap value derived for all the films is similar to 1.4 eV. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Owing to the excellent mechanical properties and toughness of bainite steels, bainite is regarded as a desirable microstructure for new-generation high-strength weathering steels. In this work, high-strength weathering steels with different N/C ratios were developed using a bainite matrix and co-precipitation of nanoscale precipitates. The precipitation pathway and mechanism of co-precipitation were studied by microstructure observation. The tensile test experimental results showed that the yield strength, tensile strength, and elongation of the steel with 0.036% C and 0.036% N are higher than 550 MPa, 650 MPa, and 20%, respectively, which satisfy the design goals for mechanical properties in the new high-strength weathering steels.

AB Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are promising alternatives to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) in view of the natural abundance and low cost of sodium resource. Constructing high-performance anode is essential and challenging for the futuristic SIBs development. Transition metal sulfides have been proved as promising anode materials for SIBs due to their large specific capacities. Here, in situ assembly of cobalt sulfide nanosheets on stainless steel mesh (SSM/CoS) as a binder-free anode for SIBs is carried out through a facile electrochemical deposition procedure. The SSM/CoS products are directly used as anode electrodes without addition of binder and conductive additives. As a result, a high capacity of 313 mAh g(-1) is obtained at a current density of 50 mA g(-1) over 100 cycles. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The catalytic modules based on Rh/theta-Al2O3/FeCrAlloy wire mesh composite were designed and manufactured. Due to enhanced heat transfer properties, the module exhibits an excellent performance for natural gas partial oxidation, providing thermodynamic equilibrium product distribution and synthesis gas productivity of 56.7 m(3)L(ca)(t)(1)h(-1) (s.c.) at 800 degrees C and gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 80000 h(-1). The catalyst demonstrated stable operation with start/stop cycles for at least 20 h on stream. Analysis by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) technique, X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy revealed no damages of the catalytic coating and confirmed structural stability of the catalyst under operating conditions. Despite the elevated operational temperatures achieving 940 degrees C and rapid temperature changes, the composite catalyst retained a high Rh dispersion and good adhesion of the theta-Al2O3 layer.

AB Mg2SnO4 was successfully synthesized by modified Pechini method. The influence of calcination temperature on structural and morphological properties was investigated. Material was evaluated on photo-discoloration of golden yellow Remazol dye at different concentrations under UVC irradiation. X-ray diffraction patterns indicate the formation of an inverse cubic spinel phase with good crystallinity and high purity. FTIR and Raman spectroscopy results reinforced the synthesis of this type of structure. PL emission spectra clearly exhibit two emission bands, which are originated from defects created inside the band gap possibly related to oxygen vacancies. Photocatalytic efficiency of magnesium stannate may be related to this defects. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The physical properties of nano-sized metal oxide semiconductors are influenced by the nanostructures as well as the crystallinity, thus the growth of crystalline tin oxide (SnO) with controlled morphologies would be important to its applications. To date, the various morphologies of SnO have been successfully synthesized such as nanodisks, nanobelts, nanoplatelets, nanoslabs, nanoflowers, and nanobranches. Here, the vertical free-standing SnO nanostructures were densely grown on single layer graphene (SLG) by vapor transport method. Compared with the tilted SnO nanostructures on SiO2/Si substrate, surface area ratio of the free-standing SnO nanostructures exhibit over of 4.4 times. According to analysis results such as Raman spectroscopy, FE-SEM, XRD, and FE-TEM, uniform and high quality free-standing SnO nanostructures were grown on large area SLG. We observed that the synthetic shapes of SnO nanostructures are different depending on the presence or absence of graphene film on substrate. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A novel La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta based ternary carbonate composite membrane was developed via melting impregnation. The enhanced carbon dioxide permeability is due to the existence of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta, a mixed ionic-electronic conductor, and the carbonate phases. The composite membrane greatly promotes the CO2 surface reaction rate to form CO32 and the subsequent ionic transport rate. To further understand the mechanism, the effect of O-2 on carbon dioxide permeability was also analyzed under fuel gas conditions. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Effect of 1 MeV electron irradiation with the dose up to 160 x 10(15) cm(2) on the electrical properties of reduced graphene oxide paper (rGOP) was investigated in a temperature range of 8-300 K. It was found that rGOP has fairly high irradiation stability, but sufficiently high dose causes nonmonotonic changes in the resistivity. The effect of electron irradiation on the resistivity is more substantial under the low temperatures of electrical measurements. It was assumed that the modification of electrical properties is due to the effect of electron irradiation on the ensembles of the sp(3)-hybridized carbon atoms. It was shown that in the studied rGOP, the transport of charge carriers occurs by variable range hopping conductivity in the wide temperature range and conduction mechanism remains the same after electron irradiation.

AB In current work, a novel ultrasonic resonance plastic deformation (URPD) technique was firstly reported to effectively introduce high density of micro/nano deformation twins in a coarse-grained 316L stainless steel, which can simultaneously improve its strength and ductility (the uniform elongation increased from 49 +/- 1.5% to 58 +/- 2% and the ultimate strength increased from 600 +/- 8 MPa to 670 +/- 8 MPa). This approach is superior to many conventional strengthening methods for realizing a strength-ductility synergy in a metallic material while without obvious changing its geometry. The URPD technique is also thought applicable to other metallic materials. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The design and synthesis of highly efficient electrocatalysts for OER are important for energy storing applications. In this communication, Cu(TCNQ)(2) nanorod arrays have been designed and synthesized successfully with a Cu(Fe)OOH nanosheet shell by using a short oxidation process of Cu(TCNQ)(2) and subsequently an ultrafast ion exchange reaction. They are expected to combine a variety of desired merits including a simple and rapid preparation process, a large specific surface area, high conductivity and multiple electrocatalytic active sites. All the worthy characteristics which make Cu(TCNQ)(2) @Cu(Fe) OOH are endowed with an excellent OER catalytic performances with the required overpotential of 261 mV at 25 mA cm(2) only. The present work not only produces a good OER catalyst but also provides us a new idea to design efficient OER electrocatalysts. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB A tunable Ge3Sb2Te6 metasurface is numerically introduced with near-unity absorption and large tuning range. It has a perfect absorptance of 100% for the crystalline state of Ge3Sb2Te6. Absorptance will have a low intensity for the amorphous state of Ge3Sb2Te6. The designed absorber is insensitive to polarization and robust against incident angle. This design may have potential applications in stealth technology, anti-radar detection, and phase-sensitive biosensor. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A novel all-organic composite of covalent organic framework (COF) and polyaniline (PANI) was successfully designed and prepared. By combining the highly porous and redox active TpPa-COF and conductive PANI, TpPa-COF@PANI composite electrodes showed greatly improved performance in supercapacitor application. After 30,000 cycles, the capacity retention rate of the battery is as high as 83%, which indicates that the electrode has great cycling stability. The strategy reported in this work may shed light on the design of new redox active COFs based faradaic supercapacitors and have a great potential for other electrochemical devices.

AB In this work, spinel LixMn2O4 with high crystallinity are successfully synthesized via a simple polyol-reflux process. Li0.93Mn2O4 shows ultrathin nanosheets structure (4 nm in thickness) with exposed {1 1 1} facets, which can effectively restrain the Mn dissolution. The Li0.93Mn2O4 (LMO-1) nanosheets delivers much larger Li+ diffusion coefficient (2.50 x 10(-11) cm(2) s(-1)) and much higher discharge capacity (124.6 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C) than that of commercial particles (104.1 mAh g(-1), 2.97 x 10(-12) cm (2) s(-1)) and makes the discharge capacity approaching the theoretical capacity (138.24 mAh g(-1)). Moreover, the obtained Li0.93Mn2O4 nanosheets have high initial coulombic efficiency (99.6%) and 92% capacity retentions up to 100 cycles, indicating high reversible performance.

AB A novel ultrasonic vibration dispersion method was used to produce TiN nanopowder decorated TiN/AlSi10Mg composite powder. The promising selective laser melting (SLM) technique was then used to fabricated TiN/AlSi10Mg nanocomposites. It showed that the near-spherical composite powder surface was uniformly distributed with TiN nanopowder. The laser reflectivity of the composite powder was reduced from 62% to 25% compared to that of the original powder. The SLMed composite parts, with a uniform distribution of nano TiN reinforcing particles and well-bonded interfaces, could be successfully formed at a low laser power of 100 W. A few agglomerated TiN particles grew into micron-sized spherical clusters. With the addition of TiN, the microstructure was significantly refined, and the hardness of the samples increased from 126 HV0.1 to 145 HV0.1. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The physical and electrical properties of magnetron sputtering fabricated (Fe, N) co-doping tin oxide thin films were investigated. The deposited films are in polycrystalline tetragonal structure. No Fe metal clusters or secondary phases are formed. All the films display n-type conductivity and the carrier concentration of (Sn1-xFex)O1.982N0.018 films, x = 0, 0.023, 0.042, 0.075 and Sn0.987Fe0.013(O-2 N-y(y)) films, y = 0, 0.038, 0.091, 0.130 decrease monotonically with Fe and N co-doping. Transport mechanism of the films can be attributed to the Mott variable range hopping (VRH) model. The SnO1.982N0.018 films showed maximum optical transmittance 90% in the visible region. The red-shift in the band gap energy can be attributed to the sp-d exchange interaction between the SnO2 band electrons and the substitutional N for O in SnO2 lattice. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Heterostructures of PoPD/ZnWO4/FACs composite was successfully synthesized through hydrothermal self-assembly and photo-initiating method. The structure, morphology, optical absorption property and photocatalytic activity of products were investigated. The results revealed that the composites photocatalysts were composed of hollow core of fly-ash cenospheres, and shell of snowflake-like ZnWO4 nanorods modified with PoPD nanoparticles. The PoPD/ZnWO4/FACs composite showed strong absorption both in UV and visible light region and the band gap is changed to 2.69 eV correspondingly. It is found that the introduction of PoPD nanoparticles in composites leads to high separation efficiency of photo-generated electron-hole pairs and enhanced photoactivity in visible light. The degradation of hydrochloride pollutants by PoPD/ZnWO4/FACs under visible light is greatly improved compared with pure ZnWO4 and ZnWO4/FACs. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The superlattice structure was evidenced by cross-sectional high resolution-transmission electron microscopy. The composite photocatalysts displayed visible light adsorption and reduced photoluminescence signal, revealing a valid electronic coupling between the CoFe-LDHs nanosheets and titania nanosheets. Remarkably, under the visible light irradiation, the composite photocatalysts extremely enhanced photocatalytic activity, which were 14.0 and 2.7 times that of titania and CoFe-LDHs nanosheet. The superlattice structure can promote electron transfer, which benefit from the compact stacking structure and matching band gap. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB YBa2Cu3O7-x, NayCoO2 and YBa2Cu3O7-x-NayCoO2 segmented ceramics were successfully prepared by a conventional sintering method. The fabrication at suitable sintering conditions for each ceramic did not affect phase formation and purity. The microstructural observation indicated that the atomic diffusion occurred at interfacial area of the segmented ceramics which induced an increase of charge carriers due to the creation of oxygen vacancies. YBa2Cu3O7-x-NayCoO2 segmented ceramic showed high figure of merit value at a wide temperature range from 500 to 700 K when compared to individual YBa2Cu3O7-x and NayCoO2 ceramics. These results suggested that this segmented ceramic might be a potential material for thermoelectric devices working at intermediate temperature range. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE Sodium copper chlorophyllin; Supercapacitors; Rate capability;
   Biomaterials; Electronic materials
AB Sodium copper chlorophyllin (SCC) is an ideal candidate electronic material for environmentally benign and low-cost devices. In this work, SCC is used as electrodes, PVA/KOH gel as solid state electrolyte and cellulosic as a separator to fabricate all-solid-state supercapacitors (SCs). The experimental results show that the SCs have ultra-high rate capability up to 100 V/s and fast frequency response (tau(0) = 7 ms), which imply an excellent capacitive behavior and fast charge propagations within the electrodes. The bending tests indicate the good bend ability and flexibility of SCC-based SCs. This study demonstrates the potential uses of SCC in green, renewable, low-cost and flexible SCs.

TI Hydrodynamic cavitation enhanced biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles at

SO MATERIALS LETTERS

ID REACTORS
AB Hydrodynamic cavitation (HC) was employed in order to enhance the biological reducibility of biomass to produce silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) readily. UV-Vis spectra analysis, TEM, HRTEM, SAED and XRD were used to characterize the materials. The results confirmed that AgNPs with uniform distribution could be successfully synthesized by hydrodynamic cavitation enhanced biosynthesis using CP (C. Platycladi) leaf extract (0.3 g/L) without pH enhanced at room temperature (30 degrees C). Finally, the electron spin resonance (ESR) technique was then applied to detect the mechanism of the enhanced biosynthesis of AgNPs in the HC system. It is concluded that the "hot spot" generated resulting from bubble collapsing is the crucial factor to enhance the reaction. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, highly crystalline mesoporous zeolite FAU was synthesized via a fast hydrothermal method. Conventional microporous zeolite 13X and polyethylene glycol (PEG 400) were used as seed and polymeric solubilizer agents, respectively. The results of several characterization techniques such as nitrogen adsorption-desorption analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray (SEM/EDX) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy demonstrated that obtaining well-developed zeolite crystals with mesopore size distribution of 2-10 nm could only be possible in the presence of both seeds and PEG. Seeding played a promoting role in zeolite FAU nucleation while PEG helped synthetic gel to crystallize well. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID WASTE-WATER TREATMENT; PHOTOCATHODE
AB Silver bromide/bismuth vanadate (AgBr/BiVO4) composite was found to have excellent photosensitive properties. In comparison with bare BiVO4 counterpart, the AgBr/BiVO4 photoanode is more favorable to visible-light activation under AM1.5G illumination to achieve higher generation of electron-hole pairs. The AgBr/BiVO4 composite can also retard recombination of the charges by means of heterojunction electron transport. As a result, the photogenerated electrons and holes have high reduction and oxidation capabilities, respectively. For the first time, AgBr/BiVO4 photoanode was employed to construct a dual-photoelectrode photocatalytic fuel cell (PFC). The experimental analysis conducted revealed that the AgBr/BiVO4 composite successfully enhanced the PFC to achieve excellent photoelectrochemical activities. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Cu foils with various initial roughness were prepared and graphene was grown on each Cu foil. Graphene nuclei density was highly related to the initial surface roughness of Cu foil. Smoothing was done on Cu foil and initial roughness was relieved during 3 h annealing, but Cu surface with high surface roughness and impurity atoms provides larger nuclei density for the graphene growth. Heteronuclei effect of size variations of impurity atoms on multilayer graphene formation was calculated. Electropolishing was carried out to suppress the heteronuclei effect and the nuclei formation on Cu surface as well. For electropolished Cu substrate, nuclei density of graphene was extremely low even without extended pre-annealing step. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, pristine Ti3C2Tx (MXene), as an electrocatalyst, demonstrated potential for use in electro-chemical sensing applications, in which the delamination process was found to be a key factor in the electrochemical property. A pair of carbendazim redox peaks with a very low overpotential was recorded at the Ti3C2Tx modified electrode. The computational study suggested that the surface fluorine termination, which resulted from the HF etching process, could effectively trigger the electrocatalytic redox. Therefore, pristine Ti3C2Tx can be considered as an excellent electrode modifier for further electrochemical sensor design. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

For Fe40Mn40Co10Cr10 HEA, the jointly activated twinning and martensitic phase transformation concurrently increase the strength and ductility at 77 K. In contrast, twinning and phase transformation gradually vanish as temperature decreases for carbon alloyed HEAs, resulting in ductile-brittle transition. Our findings indicate that the additional interstitial carbon atoms increase the f.c.c. phase stability, and inhibit the deformability of Fe40Mn40Co10Cr10 HEA at low temperature.

AB The morphological control of hybrid Cu-Cu2O nanostructures during electrochemical migration (ECM) fabrication was systematically investigated by performing a series of current-stressing experiments. Here, in order to induce ECM, a direct voltage was applied to two separated Cu electrodes at a fixed distance, which were set in an acrylic cell filled with deionized water. By changing the cell temperature and voltage, porous spongy and bamboo-leaf-like hybrid Cu-Cu2O nanostructures were obtained. The branch diameter and length increased with an increase in cell temperature, while the increase in applied voltage resulted in fine nanostructures. These results indicate that the morphology of hybrid Cu-Cu2O nanostructures can be easily controlled by changing experimental parameters, which is advantageous over conventional fabrication methods in which special chemical agents are usually necessary.

The phase formation and degree of functionalization of as-synthesized ZnO-NFs/RGO NCs was confirmed from XRD and FT-IR spectroscopic analysis, respectively. The hierarchical ZnO nanoflowers consist of 2D nanosheets wrapped with RGO nanosheets was confirmed from FE-SEM and HR-TEM images. The synthesized ZnO-NFs/RGO NCs exhibits a high specific capacitance of 203 F g(-1) at the current density of 1 Ag-1 with good rate performance and also showed an excellent electrochemical stability of 98% for 10,000 cycles at high current density of 20 A g(-1).

AB In this paper, we report the single step fabrication of nanostructured CuIn(SxSe1 x)(2) (CISSe) thin films employing the spray pyrolysis method, using low cost precursors. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to report the use of selenium dioxide as the source for selenium in the spray synthesis of CISSe thin films. The use of SeO2 as the Se source makes the whole process of spray synthesis of such compounds eco-friendly and economical. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and optical transmission spectra confirm that the sprayed material is single phase CISSe with an optical band gap similar to 1.25 eV. Solar cells of the type glass/FTO/ZnO/CdS/CISSe/Ag were fabricated and the best cell exhibits an AM 1.5 conversion efficiency of 4.9%. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We herein report green synthesis of water-soluble AgInS2 (AIS) quantum dots (QDs) for the detection of ascorbic acid (AA). The optical analysis showed that addition of AA increased the photoluminescence (PL) intensity of the QDs by suppressing the surface defects via the chelating action of AA. The relationship between the PL intensity and AA concentration was found to be linear over a range of 0.66 mu M-99 mu M. The AIS QDs exhibited excellent limit of detection (LOD = 26 nM) and can be employed as optical sensor for rapid detection of AA in aqueous solutions. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Flash butt welds show variation in impact toughness from the fusion line (FL) to the parent material (PM). A direct correlation of the variation in toughness, (1 1 0)[0 0 1] Goss texture and grain boundary misorientation fractions were observed. PM texture transformed to Goss, rotated Goss and rotated cube components in the thermo-mechanically affected zone (TMAZ) due to the shear deformation experienced during the upsetting stage. Whereas in the heat affected zone (HAZ) adjacent to TMAZ only microstructural changes were observed. Formation of (1 1 0)[0 0 1] texture component, higher fraction of Low Angle Grain Boundaries (LABs) as a result of deformation close to FL resulted in deterioration of toughness.

AB The microstructure and properties of a V-Ti microalloyed forging steel was optimized by boron addition. The uneven distribution of boron suppressed the formation of grain boundary ferrite (GBF) and promoted the formation of intragranular ferrite (IGF) idiomorphs. The volume fraction of GBF decreases from 21.2% to 14.3%, while that of IGF idiomorphs increases from 3.5% to 10.2%. After boron addition, the strength of the steel has little change, but the total elongation increases from 21.2% to 23.6%, and the impact energy increases from 38.2 J to 51.4 J, which is attributed to the higher volume fraction of IGF idiomorphs.

Characterization by XRD, Raman spectroscopy and FTIR provide strong evidence for reduction of GO. The reduced graphene oxide (rGO) exhibited wrinkle structure indicating its suitability for gas sensing. Further, reduced graphene oxide shows 4.1% and 9.5% response for 10 ppm concentration of NO gas at 50 and 100 degrees C respectively. The response was 0.87% for 1% H-2 gas at 50 degrees C and 2.07% at 100 degrees C. This investigation indicates the usefulness of green synthesized rGO for gas sensing. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB A novel and environmentally benign two-step method has been developed to grow 2D magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)(2)) nanoflakes. Our method relies on the deposition of Mg films by magnetron sputtering, followed by reaction with water vapor, and does not require any catalyst or harsh acid-base conditions. The 2D nanoflake surface morphology with a crystalline hexagonal structure was dominant on the Mg(OH)(2) films. The water contact angle on the film was similar to 139 degrees, which testified the good hydrophobicity of Mg(OH)(2) films due to the nanoflake surface. The self-cleaning effect of contaminant particles on hydrophobic Mg(OH)(2) films was analyzed. Compared with other preparation methods, this two-step method is more efficient, cleaner, and simpler, which make it suitable for complex or large-area substrate surfaces. In addition, this method can be applied to other metal hydroxides or oxides. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB SnO2-based flower-like sensitive materials derived from the self-assembled SnS2 microstructures with more active areas and less agglomeration represent an alternative option for new generation of gas sensors. Meanwhile, the introduction of ZIF-8 for semiconductor surface functionalization is expected to get multi-functional hybrid materials with synergistic effects of individual components. In the present work, SnS2/ZIF-8 derived porous flower-like SnO2/ZnO heterostructures have been synthesized by a facile template method and the subsequent heat-treatment process. Beside the uniform morphology with tunable composition and size distribution, the attractive findings are focused on the enhanced triethylamine (TEA) gas-sensing properties of the obtained composites. SnO2/ZnO heterostructures show an obvious improvement in TEA gas sensing performance at the operating temperature of 200 degrees C, giving a response of about 17.7-50 ppm TEA, which was about 2.2 times higher than that of the sensors based on pure SnO2.

AB The rise of modern communication devices has seriously imperiled human health due to electromagnetic (EM) pollution. In this context, the aim of this work is to develop novel reduced graphene oxide/Co-doped ZnNi ferrite/polyaniline ternary composites that exhibit enhanced microwave absorption properties. It is observed that the ternary composite prepared by in-situ polymerization show best EM absorption. The maximum reflection loss (R-L ) reaches -24.2 dB and the efficient bandwidth (R-L < -10 dB) is more than 3 GHz with an absorbed thickness of 1.7 mm. The in-depth analysis based on complex permittivity and permeability reveals that the improved microwave absorption ability is related to the uniform sandwich-like multilayer structure and impedance compatibility of the ternary composites. The results and analysis show that these ternary composites with small thickness and wide absorption band are the potential candidates for microwave absorption applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Nickel Oxide (NiO) nanosheet architecture films were synthesized using solution immersion method on indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass at different growth times. The X-ray diffraction patterns and Raman spectra reveal that crystalline NiO films were grown on ITO glass. The microscopy images exhibit the presence of 10 nm-width nanosheet architectures. The thickness of NiO nanosheet array films increases from 0.78 mu m to 2.50 mu m, when the growth time increases from 1 h to 3 h. The estimated energy bandgap for the prepared NiO nansosheets ranges from 3.55 to 3.62 eV. The prepared NiO nanosheet architecture films has good optical transmittance in the visible region. In this work, the synthesized NiO nanosheet arrays have high potential application for liquid ethanol sensor based on a good sensing response at room temperature. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB We reported a facile and easily controllable electrodeposition-and-ion exchange technique for synthesis of Ni3S2/carbon nanotubes (CNTs) nanocomposites on the surface of Ni foam for supercapacitor applications. When tested as electrode for a supercapacitor, a large surface area of the Ni3S2/CNTs hybrid nanoarchitecture was proven and it showed an excellent specific capacitance of 1643 F/g at the current density of 1 A/g, and maintains 999 F/g at 20 A/g. The Ni3S2 /CNTs electrode also displayed good cycle stability with capacitance retention of 91.5% after 2000 cycles in 3 M KOH electrolyte. Because of these outstanding properties, the Ni3S2/CNTs nanocomposites are becoming promising candidates for the high performance binder-free supercapacitor electrodes. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB A heterogeneous bimodal-grained AlxCoCrFeNi high entropy alloy was realized through friction stir processing (FSP) with the addition of Al powders. With the bimodal-grained structure and second phases, strength was increased and ductility was retained as compared with the friction stir processed base alloy. Face-centered cubic grains in the matrix were refined from similar to 500 mu m to similar to 15 mu m by FSP and subsequent recrystallization. With addition of Al powders, localized Al-rich regions facilitated the formation of body-centered cubic phase (Al, Ni-rich) and Al rich precipitates, which further refined grain size to similar to 5 mu m and enhanced local strength.

AB Herein, we present the synthesis and electrochemiluminescence (ECL) sensing applications of the Au-Co/GO nanocomposite. Au-Co/GO nanocomposite was prepared for the first time by decorating graphene oxide (GO) with alloy-structured Au-Co bimetallic nanoparticles (BNPs) via one-step on site chemical reduction. The obtained nanocomposite was comprehensively characterized and the results showed that alloy-structured Au-Co nanoparticles (NPs) have an average size of 4 nm and are highly dispersed on GO layers. ECL measurement revealed that the as-synthesized Au-Co/GO nanocomposite displays a synergistic effect of the GO and the Au-Co BNPs on luminol-H2O2 ECL signal. Further immobilization of glucose oxidase (GOD) onto the Au-Co/GO modified electrode afforded a effective ECL glucose sensor which displayed a dynamic range of 1-100 mu M with a satisfactory detection limit of 0.18 mu M. Furthermore, the developed enzymatic sensors were successfully applied for monitoring glucose in real human samples. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Conjugated polymer PCz-TPE based on carbazole and tetraphenylethylene units was synthesized via Yamamoto-type coupling under microwave heating. PCz-TPE exhibits AIE phenomenon and high photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield in solid state due to the introduction of tetraphenylethylene moieties in polymer backbone and sidechain. Considering its electronic property and packed structure in aggregated state, PL sensing experiment toward TNT analyte was carried out based on PCz-TPE aggregates dispersion in THF/90 vol% water. As expected, PCz-TPE aggregates indicate high sensitivity for TNT detection, with maximum Stern-Volmer quenching constant of 8.5 x 10(4) M-1. Also, paper strips test demonstrates a promising potential of PCz-TPE for solid sensor application towards nitroaromatic explosives. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, piezoelectric hybrid carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composite laminates are developed by embedding potassium sodium niobate (KNN) nano-particle filled epoxy interlayer, and the composite samples are successfully polarized. The output voltage of the samples due to impact load is then measured. The results show that a voltage higher than 50 mV is generated.

AB In order to improve the gas sensing performance of traditional SnO2 semiconductor nanomaterials, Bi-doped SnO2 hierarchical flower-shaped nanostructures had been synthesized by a one-step hydrothermal route. Diverse techniques characterization results collectively revealed that Bi ions have been successfully doped into SnO2 lattice and samples present numerous uniform flower-shaped nanostructures composed of many layered petal-like thin nanosheets. Benefiting from such unique 3D hierarchical flower-shaped nanostructures and Bi doping, the sensors based on Bi-doped SnO2 exhibited superior gas sensing performance concluding higher response value, faster response/recovery time, good stability and excellent selectivity to HCHO at the optimum operating temperature of 170 degrees C. Therefore, Bi-doped SnO2 hierarchical flower-shaped nanostructures could be used as a candidate semiconductor gas sensing materials for manufacturing highly sensitive HCHO gas sensors in the future.

AB CuO is an attractive p-type semiconductor due to narrow band gap, low cost, and easy availability. In this paper, we obtained CuO crystals through a simple sol-gel method at room temperature. The samples were proved to be pure CuO crystals through the X-ray diffraction and Raman measurement. The reaction time and OH concentration played a critical role in the structure and morphologies of pure CuO crystals. Through adjusting of the pH value, several different morphologies, including leaf-like, featheriness structure, and flake-like, were obtained. This paper provided a very simple, low cost and environmentally friendly method to control the morphologies of CuO. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Biosynthesis of gold nanoparticles from Dragon fruit extract (DF extract) can be considered as an ecofriendly alternative for synthesis of gold nanoparticles. The aim of this study was to investigate the ability of this fruit to synthesize gold nanoparticles and to study its anticancer activity. The as synthesized gold nanoparticles were characterized by UV-vis spectrophotometry, X-ray diffraction, Fourier Transform Infra-red spectroscopy and Transmission Electron microscopy. The results from XRD and TEM support the biosynthesis of DF extract capped gold nanoparticles (DF-AuNPs) in the size range of 10-20 nm. The DF extract and DF-AuNPs induced significant growth inhibition of MCF-7 breast cancer cells however, no significant toxicity effect was observed on MDA-MB-231 cells. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Semi-transparent solar cells have been well developed in recent years, and can potentially be applied in many areas. Sb2Se3 has also received an increasing amount of attention because of its excellent optoelectronic properties. In order to combine these advantages, we attempted to fabricate a semi-transparent thin-film Sb2Se3 solar cell which meanwhile maintains the high efficiency. The effect of thickness of Sb2Se3 thin film on the optical and electrical properties were investigated. The optical absorption and power conversion efficiency were improved for Sb2Se3 thin film solar cells as the increase of the thickness of Sb2Se3 thin film, however, the obtained 120-nm-thick Sb2Se3 film was completely opaque. The optimized device was achieved with the thickness of 80 nm which exhibits the semi-transparent property and almost the same efficiency as the 120 nm Sb2Se3 thin film solar cell. This work demonstrates that the fabricated device has potential for applications in small wearable devices and may be extended to large-area glass-face applications.

ID FABRICATION; REGENERATION; PARTICLES
AB Three-dimensional (3D), highly porous, and low-density fibrous scaffolds have attracted significant interest in recent years for applications in tissue engineering. However, the fabrication of 3D fluffy fibrous piezoelectric scaffolds remains a challenge. In this study, we report the dramatic effect that relative humidity (RH) has on the deposition of 3D cotton-like constructs composed of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) piezoelectric nanofibers mixed with Barium Titanate (BT) and multiwalled-carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). The 30 mm diameter deposits were fabricated under variable humidity conditions while all other parameters were kept constant. Two types of fibrous architecture, 3D fluffy and two-dimensional (2D) membrane types, are recognized, as the RH during electrospinning varies. A fiber morphology transition takes place at certain RH, and the 3D cotton-like nanofibrous structure has been optimized above 90% RH. The fabrication of the 3D cotton-like fibrous piezoelectric scaffold may provide new insights for various applications in tissue engineering. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Zn-Al-NO2 layered double hydroxide (LDH) is proposed as a controlled-release inhibitor for steel reinforcements in chloride-contaminated concrete. The cumulative amount of nitrite released from LDH is sensitive to the chloride concentration in the solution. Compared with NaNO2, Zn-Al-NO2 LDH increased the chloride threshold value from 0.15 to 0.25 M and simultaneously decreased the critical [NO2]/[Cl] molar ratio from 0.09 to 0.02. In conclusion, the Zn-Al-NO2 LDH exhibits considerably higher inhibiting performance due to the on-demand release of NO2-. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The ability to mimic the topography of aligned collagen fiber bundles (A-CFB) that form the structural basis for the extracellular matrix (ECM) can be an important step in the fabrication of engineered scaffolds. Because the cell adhesion to the surface topography involve cell adhesion localized structures, topographical features, which mimics the A-CFB of the matrix can be a significant factor for cell activities. In this study, we present a novel method for the fabrication of low-density electrospun fibers mimicking A-CFB constructs. The three dimensional (3D) cotton-like A-CFB mimetic scaffold (3D-CACMS) of a mixture of lactic acid (LA) and polycaprolactone (PCL) was prepared by multiple pins rotator electrospinning (MPRES), followed by selective leaching of LA. The results of SEM, FTIR, TGA, and DSC revealed the physicochemical properties of the as-fabricated scaffold. This 3D-CACMS attempt to mimic A-CFB and can potentially meet the requirements for practical use of biomedical engineering. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We investigate the structural and magnetic properties of Fe2TiO5 nanopowders prepared by ball-milling and post annealing. From the structural analysis, we observe the crystalline signature of the pseudobrookite phase. Moreover, by exploring distinct aspects of the magnetic behavior, we find fingerprints of the longitudinal spin freezing, with cluster spin glass transition taking place at 56 K, and of the presence of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in the system. Further, we observe antiferromagnetic features for the nanopowder at 300 K, and hysteresis loop with an abrupt change in magnetization characterizing the ferromagnetic behavior at 4 K. The results place the employed route as a simple, low-cost candidate to the production of nanopowders, especially Pseudobrookite. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, high quality two-dimension (2D) SnS2 nanoflakes as visible-light responsive photocatalysts were prepared by a facile solvothermal method. And Au/SnS(2)composites were fabricated by a rapid microwave-assisted process. The Au/SnS2 heterojunction showed excellent photocatalytic activities in comparison with the bare SnS2 . The optimal sample named Au/SnS2-4 can degrade 92.9% MB after 1 h under visible light irradiation. The enhanced photocatalytic activities are due to the LSPR effect of Au NPs and the special structure of SnS2. The theoretical investigations showed that electrons can transfer from the SnS2 to the Au across the interface. Finally, a synergetic photocatalytic mechanism was proposed. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB A low-cost self-supported ECR-1 zeolite membrane was synthesized by utilization of silica fume waste as stating material adjusted Si/Al molar ratio with metakaolin for the first time. XRD patterns confirmed that the amorphous geopolymer was entirely converted into self-supported ECR-1 zeolite membrane. FESEM microphoto indicated that the ECR-1 showed wheat-sheaf crystalline morphology with average aspect ratio of 5. The as-synthesized self-supported ECR-1 zeolite membrane exhibited an excellent seawater desalination performance. When the system was kept up the negative pressure of 0.08 MPa, the rejections for mixed Na+, k(+), Mg2+ Ca2+ and Cl ions in simulated seawater averagely approached to 99.99%, 97.32%, 100%, 100% and 96.82%, respectively.

AB In this work, we have studied the structural and magnetic properties of yttrium iron garnet nanoparticles doped with copper obtained by sol gel method. The lattice parameter decreases from 12.3779 angstrom to 12.3774 angstrom, for low doping and increases from 12.3788 angstrom to 12.3814 angstrom for high copper concentrations. The variation in the crystallite size was related with defects and internal stress produced by the dopant addition. The micrographs showed a similar format, rounded irregular form and lengthened, for all samples. Saturation magnetization (Ms) confirmed the substitution of Fe/Cu in the octahedral sites of YIG. Ms increased from 24.04 emu/g to 29.49 emu/g for dopant concentration varying from 0.00 to 0.01. For y = 0.03 the Ms = 26.05 emu/g and for y = 0.05, Ms = 26.35 emu/g. Changes in the coercivity (Hc) values are attributed to the pinning centers existence and particle format. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, a novel MnO2/g-C3N4@polypyrrole (PPy) ternary nanocomposite (NC) was fabricated by coupling the MnO2 nanorods with the two-dimensional g-C3N4 sheets and the conductive PPy. The MnO2/g-C3N4@PPy NC electrode exhibited a high specific capacitance of 274 F g(-1) at a current density of 2 A g(-1), which was 1.88 times than that of the MnO2@PPy NC electrode. The MnO2/gC(3)N(4)@PPy NC electrode also possessed outstanding cyclic stability with 95% capacitance retention after 1000 cycles. The present strategy for fabricating ternary nanocomposite uses low-cost raw materials and simple preparation method, which provides an alternative route to optimize the SC performance of other pseudocapacitive oxides.

AB Hydroxyapatite (HAP) is the foremost inorganic components of human hard tissues and has been widely applied as biomaterials for replacing or repairing. In this study, hydroxyapaptite (HAP) nanoparticles with controllable morphology were facilely synthesized by hydrothermal treatment of abandoned abalone shells without adding any organic template agent. The morphology of HAP nanoparticles could be tailored by manipulating the hydrothermal temperature (from 60 degrees C to 150 degrees C). And it covers leaf-like, flower-like, fish scale-like, snow-like and rod-like shape. Besides, a small amount of calcium carbonate was left in the HAP particles, which was gradually decreased as the hydrothermal temperature increased and all of the samples have negative surface potential. This study provides a solution for synthesis of different HAP nanoparticle morphology from abandoned abalone shell. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB beta-CaSiO3-Ca2ZnSi2O7 bioceramics were successfully prepared by pressureless-sintering, series of Ca2ZnSi2O7 varying from 5 to 40 wt% were added and the effects of Ca2ZnSi2O7 on ceramics degradability and apatite-formation ability were comprehensively investigated by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDS). The results indicated that the degradability of beta-CaSiO3-Ca2ZnSi2O7 eramics gradually decreased with the Ca2ZnSi2O7 contents and a hydroxyapatite layer on the ceramics surface was confirmed during soaking in simulated body fluid (SBF), suggesting that the addition of Ca2ZnSi2O7 was a promising route to adjust the beta-CaSiO3 ceramics degradability and apatite-formation ability.

   microspheres
SO MATERIALS LETTERS
LA English
DT Article

ID GAS-SENSING PERFORMANCE; HOLLOW SPHERES; HETEROJUNCTION; SENSORS
AB In this work, ZnO was decorated onto SnO2 microspheres via a facile solvothermal method, and the gas sensing characteristics of the ZnO/SnO2 composites was systematically studied. Results showed that the ZnO/SnO2 composites was highly responsive to NO2, with much lower response to interfering gases such as ethanol and acetone. At the optimum temperature (200 degrees C), the response of the ZnO/SnO2 composite to 100 ppm NO2 was about 3 times higher than that of pristine SnO2 microspheres. Furthermore, ZnO decoration on SnO2 microspheres led to significant reduction in the response time. The improvement of gas-sensing performance may be ascribed to the formation of more surface adsorption sites on the ZnO/SnO2 composite. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   plasmonic nanocavity
SO MATERIALS LETTERS

DT Article

AB Plasmonic nanocavity is a novel platform to investigate fundamental light-matter interactions. In such a cavity, the working media are localized or propagating surface plasmons, which are transverse magnetic polarized electromagnetic waves forming at a metal/dielectric interface. Therefore, the carrier dynamics and optical properties of a plasmonic nanocavity are strongly dependent on the polarization matching between the comprising emitter and the plasmonic cavity modes. Here we demonstrate a plasmonic nanocavity with an InGaN/GaN multi-quantum well emitter, fabricated by cost-effective post-growth approaches from a commercially available epiwafer. The polarization state of the emission light from the single nanorod is the same as that of plasmonic cavity mode. As a consequent, significantly enhanced optical properties of the plasmonic nanocavity has been observed, confirmed by time-resolved and power-dependent micro-photoluminescence measurements. This work provides a promising insight into the study on light-matter interaction in a plasmonic nanocavity. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We have demonstrated a time-, energy-, and cost-efficient way of preparing (MnFe)(2)(P,Si)-type magnetocaloric materials, i.e., via electromagnetic levitation melting and post-annealing from industrial-grade starting materials. The structural evolution and its influence on the magnetocaloric properties during post-annealing have been intensively studied. We found that some Fe3Si-type impurity phase with a size of around 5 mu m is present in the as-prepared sample, which can be eliminated through high-temperature annealing. The sample annealed at 1373 K for 5 h shows a homogeneous element distribution and negligible amount of the impurity phase. A Delta S-max value of 17 Jkg (1) K- 1 for a field change of 2 T has be realized in the present work, which is comparable to the highest Delta S(max )values in the (MnFe)(2)(P,Si)-type samples produced via time- and energy-consuming solid-state reaction.

The NG sheets can be obtained even at 600 degrees C. The results indicated that the content and type of doped N are intensely relied on the growth temperature.

AB We report here the electro-analytical potential of directly grown epitaxial In0.38Ga0.62N/Si(1 1 1) using cyclic voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy. Current characteristic of In0.38Ga0.62N electrode was found similar to 400 times higher than that of bare Si(1 1 1) with reduced polarization resistance value of 15.2 k Omega, which is attributed to the available highly dense positively charged surface donor states promoting electron transfer. Further, we demonstrated for the first-time successful detection of arsenite with the detection limit of 9.27 ppb in the linear dynamic range of 10-50 ppb upon surface modification with MPA utilizing As-S bond chemistry. These preliminary results offer a rugged substitutional working electrode owing to excellent electrochemical characteristics over existing electrodes for toxic metalloids sensing in water.

AB A simple hydrothermal and annealing route is employed to fabricate MoS2/NC nanocomposites by incorporating MoS2 nanosheets with galactosamine-derived nitrogen-doped carbon. It is revealed that MoS2 nanosheets are characteristic of few-layered structures (4-6 layers) in composites and are well implanted into nitrogen-doped carbon materials. Therefore, the stability and conductivity of composites are greatly enhanced. The desirable microstructures along with surface-dominated capacitive contribution of MoS2/NC result in a superior electrochemical sodium-storage performance to the bare MoS2 electrode.

AB 3D SnS2 hierarchical micro-flowers were successfully synthesized by a hydrothermal method with ZnSn(OH)(6) hollow nanospheres as precursor. The 3D hierarchical microstructure with large specific surface area was obtained by self-assembling individual 2D nanometer sized sub-units. The architectures, morphologies and gas-sensing performances of the products were characterized and it was found that sensors based on SnS2 micro-flowers had a relatively high response value to 50 ppm ammonia gas at 160 degrees C, with response and recovery times of approximately 4 s and 15 s, respectively. The good gas-performance to low-concentration of ammonia is attributed to the structure of SnS2 which possessed a large surface area and void. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   resolution transmission electron microscope
ID DEFORMATION; SELECTION
AB Twin boundary of a nano-sized {1 0 -1 2} extension twin far away from its tip has been experimentally characterized to be about 3.5 degrees from the fully coherent twin boundary (CTB), which is the twinning plane of (1 0 -1 2)(t)//(1 0 -1 2)(m). Subscripts 't' and 'm' refer respectively to twin and its matrix. In atomic scale, the twin boundary consists of PtBm-CTB step, PtBm-BtPm serration, and BtPm-CTB-PtBm serration, where PtBm and BtPm refer respectively to (1 0 -1 0)(t)//(0 0 0 1)(m) and (0 0 0 1)(t)//(1 0 -1 0)(m). The relationship between the deviation angle of a twin boundary from CTB and the structure of the twin boundary is deduced on the basis of an explicit geometric model. When the deviation angle is 3.5 degrees as measured, the ratio of the average length of CTB terraces to the average height of PtBm-CTB steps is calculated to be 15.28, representing a twin boundary dominated by CTB with relatively small strain.

ID RELIABILITY
AB The present study, for the first time, revealed the athermal recrystallization behavior at a heterogeneous metallic interface using room temperature electromigration. The athermal recrystallization occurred within the meta-stable amorphous Cu-Sn interphase, which was formed during the early stage electromigration, for stress relaxation after further electromigration. The nano-scale polycrystalline (Sn) interphase was favorably recrystallized at the intermetallic-free Cu/Sn interface where the current crowding effect occurred. Athermal electromigration force facilitated the nucleation of Sn nuclei through the kinetic energy provided by the electron momentum transfer. The formation of the recrystallized (Sn) interphase is believed to be an intermediate material interaction product prior to further intermetallic nucleation under room temperature electromigration.

DE Aluminum; Tin; Interfaces; Diffusion; Dynamic equilibrium
AB The dissolution and precipitation behavior of a solid-Al/melted-Sn system was investigated. Total Al content in the Sn bump increased continuously with time and reached 30 at%, far exceeding the solubility limit (3.7 at%) of Al in molten Sn. The reason for over-saturation was analyzed and discussed. A single-directional dynamic equilibrium process demonstrated that a a-Al solid solution can precipitate continuously from melted Sn while Al substrate is dissolved continuously by melted Sn. Ultrasonic action can improve the rate of this effect. This work could facilitate the development of a new method to improve the performance of bonding joints or multicomponent alloys.

AB Metal chalcogenide related materials have demonstrated outstanding catalytic activities for numerous chemical reactions in energy conversion devices. However, the actual active species have not yet been fully identified, especially for triiodide reduction in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). We herein adopted a vapor-phase hydrothermal (VPH) approach to controllably create the sulfur dopants on the Co3O4 nanosheets surface for high-performance DSSCs with a best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.86%. More importantly, our XPS and electrochemical analysis confirm a close correlation between the S-2 species and the electrocatalytic activities. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Flower-like NiS-Ni3S4/stereotaxically constructed graphene (NiS-Ni3S4/SCG) composite is synthesized by a hydrothermal method. When evaluated as anode materials for sodium ion battery, the material still retains a discharge capacity of 322.9 mA h g(-1) with a coulombic efficiency near 100% after 2000 cycles at 10 A g(-1), which corresponds to 69.2% of the 2nd discharge capacity. It is found that the SCG plays a positive role in improving electrochemical performance of NiS-Ni3S4 because it serves as an efficient 3D conductive network to enhance electronic conductivity and an elastic matrix to buffer volume expansion.

DE Heterojunction; Composite materials; g-C3N4; Semiconductors;
   Photocatalysis
AB The performance of semiconductor photocatalysts in organic contaminants degradation is strongly influenced by the structure-related charge separation behavior. Hence, titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanowire, which is efficient in directional migration of photocarriers, is prepared and employed as the carrier for the in situ growth of discrete graphite carbon nitride (g-C3N4) to form a compact and high-reactive heterojunction photocatalyst. The structures and properties of the samples are systematically characterized and discussed. The experimental results indicate that the tetracycline photodegradation efficiency obtained by employing TiO2@g-C3N4 as the photocatalyst is improved by 126% and 75%, respectively, compared to that using TiO2 nanowire and bulk g-C3N4. This work highlights that precisely controlling the microstructure and charge separation behavior is critical for preparing high-reactive photocatalysts. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper describes a bioresorbable composite for orthopaedic implants that has mechanical properties similar to those of natural bone.
   Nano-hydroxyapatite used to produce the nanocomposite was synthesised to achieve a structure similar to natural hydroxyapatite. Its mean particle size and specific surface area were 8 nm and 260 m(2)/g respectively. The second key component in the nanocomposite was a biodegradable polymer (polylactide). Prior to further processing, the nano-hydroxyapatite particles were annealed at temperatures from 100 degrees C to 1200 degrees C to reduce structural and surface absorbed water.
   The first step in obtaining the composite was cryomilling a mixture of nano-hydroxyapatite and polylactide at the temperature of liquid nitrogen. Each material provided 50 vol% of the composition. Cryomilling enabled the formation of composite granules that had a uniform dispersion of the ceramic in the polymer. The granulate was subsequently poured into elastic forms and pressed at an isostatic pressure of 65 MPa at 165 degrees C. This process is called warm isostatic pressing.
   The composite properties depended on the quantity of structural water included in the HAP nanopowder. A maximum compressive strength of 110 MPa and Young's modulus of 6 GPa were obtained. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The maximum length of the brushite flakes could reach 63.5 mu m in 10 s and 423.7 mu m in 20 min. The formation mechanism of the brushite flakes is proposed, identifying the influence of fiber-shaped substrate, surface oxygen-containing functional group and PED preparation method. Moreover, good biomineralization ability of the brushite flakes is confirmed by in-vitro test in simulated body fluid. The brushite flakes prepared by this method has the potential applications as bioactive coatings, biological reinforcements, biological fillers and scaffolds for tissue engineering.

In this work, taking four representative piezoceramics (0.94 (Na0.5Bi0.5)TiO3-0.06BaTiO(3), 0.2Pb(Zn1/3Nb2/3)O-3-0.8Pb(Zr0.5Ti0.5)O-3, 0.36BiScO(3)-0.64PbTiO(3) and Ba0.85Ca0.15Ti0.9Zr0.1O3) as an example, by using a designed in-situ Berlincourt-type high-temperature d 33 meter, combined with variable temperature X-ray diffraction and dielectric temperature spectrum test, it was confirmed the depolarization behavior is directly related to the structural phase transition, meanwhile it is reasonable to apply the peak value of piezoelectric coefficient with temperature, T-dp, as the depolarization characteristic temperature. More importantly, the original in-situ varied temperature d(33) meter design helps to investigate the temperature dependent piezoelectric mechanism of various piezoceramics. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Recently, CaS nanoparticles have attracted great interest because of their use in various biomedical applications. The nanoparticles should be biocompatible for its application in the biomedical field. We synthesized highly luminescent CaS nanoparticles capped with Triethanolamine (TEOA) using wet chemical coprecipitation method and its structural and optical characterization were done. The cytotoxicity analysis was carried out in human fibroblast cell lines using MIT assay, and cell imaging was done using an inverted phase contrast tissue culture microscope. The percentage viability of the samples was compared with control and the IC50 value of the nanoparticles was calculated. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A comparative study of the photocatalytic efficiency of pure and Ag doped TiO2 on the enhanced performance for the degradation of pharmaceutical products (amlodipine besylate) in aqueous solution under UV irradiation, is presented. XRD analysis reveals that the presence of even small amount of 1% Ag favors rutile-to-anatase phase transformation and grain growth. The photodegradation of amlodipine besylate measurements indicate an optimum catalytic activity of catalyst 0.5 g/L to achieve an efficiency of 100% within 100 min at 10 mg/L concentration of pollutant.

AB This study aims to evaluate the in-situ synthesis of zeolites through geopolymerization of biomass fly ash wastes at low temperature in a hermetic container. The raw materials were activated using a mixture of sodium silicate and sodium hydroxide, and then the specimens cured at 60 degrees C to obtain zeolite-containing geopolymers. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was used as a porogenic agent. X-ray diffractograms showed the presence of faujasite zeolites regardless of the added H2O2 content. P zeolite was formed without porogenic agent addition, resulting in increase in the surface area (56.35 m(2)/g) in comparison with samples cured in room conditions (40.69 m(2)/g). The identified zeolites and the mechanical strength (up to similar to 10 MPa) suggest applications as separation membranes or filters. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Zn3-3xMg3xN2 alloy layers with x <= 0.3 can be epitaxially grown at a temperature as low as 140 degrees C. The bandgap (E-g) of Zn3-3xMg3xN2 widens from 1.2 to 2.5 eV with increasing x. The E-g value of 1.4 eV is obtained at x = 0.18, and the x = 0.18 film has a large absorption coefficient (10(4) - 10(5) cm(-1) ) in the visible region. The Zn3-3xMg3xN2 with E-g = 1.4 eV shows n-type conductivity with a reasonably high electron mobility of 47 cm(2) V-1 s(-1). Therefore, Zn3-3xMg3xN2 is a candidate for an earth-abundant solar absorber that can be fabricated at low temperatures. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Hierarchical LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO) microspheres were prepared via a hydrothermal method followed by program controlled temperature calcination. The as-obtained LNMO microspheres (diameter: similar to 5 mu m) which were assembled with submicron nanorices particles (length: similar to 500 nm) (R-LNMO) could combine the superiority of the both nanosized and microsized structure, enhancing rates performance. The result indicated that R-LNMO exhibited discharge capacities of 141 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles at 2 C, together with the capacity retention of 95.2%. Besides, R-LNMO could deliver capacities of 147, 141, 137, 128, 120, 114 mAh g(-1) at rates of 0.1, 2, 5, 10, 15 and 20 C, showing prospectively superior rates performance. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB 1D NiP nanowires were prepared by sc-CO2 electroless plating (SC-ELP) from blind-hole via AAO templates. Aspect ratio limitations of conventional and SC-ELP were determined. Results revealed successful fabrication of nanowires by conventional ELP up to AR <= 33:1 while SC-ELP was effective up to AR <= 60:1, due to higher diffusivity and permeability characteristics of sc-CO2. Analysis of empty AAO templates revealed contact angle increased with increasing via diameter. Elemental structural analysis revealed higher P content in nanowires produced by SC-ELP and preferential growth in Ni(1 1 1) phase. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We studied the effect of embedded nanograins on the strength and deformation of nanodomained heterogeneous nickel (Ni) via a novel discrete-crystal plasticity model. Nanodomained structures exhibited higher strength than those of heterogeneous lamella structures and rule of mixtures. Due to the mismatch of strengths between the nanograins and coarse grains, geometrically necessary dislocations (GND) accumulated around nanograins and increased with the strain. In addition, smaller nanograins are more effective to generate GND in both nanodomained and heterogeneous lamella structures. These findings shed light on the role of dislocation mechanisms in the plasticity of heterogeneous nanostructured metals. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A series of bulk amorphous/crystal bimetal composites (BCs) were designed and prepared to utilize the advantages of bulk amorphous alloys and resolve the limitation of critical size on its applications. The typical bulk amorphousVit1 alloy and Ti alloys (pure Ti, TZ20, and TZ51 alloys) were used to prepare bulk amorphous/crystal BCs of Vit1-clad Ti alloy (Vit1/Ti alloy). Phase composition, microstructure, and hardness of Vitl-clad Ti alloy BCs were examined. Results revealed that the cladding layer of Vit1/Ti and Vit1/TZ20 is in a fully amorphous state. By contrast, partial crystallization occurs in the cladding layer of Vit1/TZ51. The prepared bulk amorphous/crystal BCs maintain the advantages of Vit1 bulk amorphous alloy while requiring minimally critical size. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This is the Monte Carlo research on phase transitions and the ground-state structure of antiferromagnets on a body-centered cubic lattice with the use of the Ising model. All possible magnetic structures of the ground-state in the dependency on exchange interaction relations r are first obtained. Depending on an r value, in the system there are possible six different orderings in the ground-state. On the curve of a critical temperature versus a value of the next- nearest neighbor interaction, we discover a narrow region (2/3 < r <= 0.75), where the transition from the antiferromagnetic to paramagnetic phase is a first-order transition. The competition of exchange interactions at r = 2/3 does not cause the frustration occurrence and the degeneration of the ground-state. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB High-performance transition metal carbonates are considered as promising electrode materials in lithium-ion batteries. However, the poor conductivity limits their further application. Herein, graphene modified CdCO3 cubic particles composite (CdCO3@rGO) are prepared using a facile hydrothermal method and their electrochemical performance are discussed. CdCO3@rGO can maintain a reversible capacity of 423.1 mAh g(-1) at 200 mA g(-1) after 100 cycles while CdCO3 only delivers a capacity of 142.0 mAh g(-1). The excellent cycling stability and rate capability of CdCO3@rGO can be attributed to graphene modification, which not only decreases the particle size with large surface area but also improves the electronic conductivity and effectively buffers volume changes during the lithium insertion/extraction process.

AB The novel Al-Si-Ni-Fe alloy with high compression strength at elevated temperatures has been successfully produced by selective laser melting at an average volumetric energy density of about 100 J/mm(3) and has a relative density of 99,86%. The hardness of as fabricated Al-Si-Ni-Fe alloy is 186HV and it decreases during heat treatment to 124HV due to stress relief and silicon particle growth. The yield compression stress is 355 MPa at 200 degrees C. This high strength is provided by the fine structure formed by the Si, Al5Fe (Ni,Cu) and Al-3(Ni,Cu) phases. The good strength properties of the alloy at elevated temperatures make it a quite promising lightweight material for high temperature applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this article, we successfully extracted HA/beta-TCP biphasic calcium phosphate from the marine fish bones (Hairtails) by various temperature calcinations. By characterizing, we confirmed that beta-TCP was obtained from the calcined products of Hairtails, and the relative content of beta-TCP in fish bones calcined at 900 degrees C significantly increased. In addition, the mechanism of changing the composition ratio of BCP by heating was also discussed. Hairtails as a raw material was used to prepare biphasic calcium phosphate ceramics can be well applied to clinical medicine. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, a novel ternary composite photocatalytic material was constructed by in-situ deposition of 0D Zn0.5Cd0.5S nanoparticles onto the 2D g-C3N4 and reduced graphene oxide (RGO) surfaces via a simple one-pot hydrothermal reaction. Through optimizing of the g-C3N4 component proportion, Zn0.5Cd0.5S heterostructure decorated with 3 wt% g-C3N4 nanosheets (Zn0.5Cd0.5S/g-C3N4) displayed a high H-2-production rate of 4.956 mmol g(-1) h(-1), which was 2.73 times higher than that of pure Zn0.5Cd0.5S nanoparticles. Additionally, when 1 wt% RGO was further introduced to the binary Zn0.5Cd0.5S/g-C3N4 heterostructure, the obtained ternary Zn0.5Cd0.5S (0D)/g-C3N4 (2D)/RGO (2D) composite catalyst exhibited the highest photocatalytic H-2-production activity, whose H-2-production rate was 5.41 times higher than that of pure Zn0.5Cd0.5S nanoparticles. The excellent activity of the ternary Zn0.5Cd0.5S/g-C3N4/RGO catalyst is associated with the cooperative effects of Zn0.5Cd0.5S nanoparticles, RGO and g-C3N4 nanosheets, which not only extend the light absorption range and intensity, but also reduce the overpotential for H-2-production and dramatically improve the charge mobility and separation, thus boosting the H-2-evolution rate over the ternary composite photocatalyst.

AB The aim of the present study was to develop novel porous, mechanically stable, hydrophilic nanocomposite polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)/Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)/hydroxyapatite (HAp)/titanium dioxide (TiO2) (PPHT) film scaffolds with nano whiskers surface morphology for bone repair applications. PPHT polymer films were prepared by solution casting technique. The FE-SEM results confirmed the porous nature of PPHT polymer films with uniform whisker shape nano size surface morphology. The contact angle and tensile strength of PPHT-10% were found to be 45 degrees and 3.9-4.4 MPa, respectively. The in vitro osteocompatibility study results showed that PPHT-10% enabled greater cell adherence, differentiation and proliferation than those on controls. The quantification of calcium adsorbed on PPHT-10%, by alizarin red S staining (ARS) method, was found to be 50.272 mu mol. Hence, the observed results stress the functionality of porous nanocomposite PPHT-10% polymer thin film as a scaffolds for bone repair applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A sandwich-structured MoS2/SnO2/Carbon cloth (MoS2/SnO2/CC) photocatalyst was successfully synthesized through simple two-step hydrothermal method. The MoS2/SnO2/CC composite exhibited an excellent photocatalysis performance for degradation of RhB dye under visible light. A hierarchical double-layer heterostructure is formed via introducing carbon cloth substrates, which not only enhances the photocatalysis activity by accelerating electrons transfer rate and further intensifying electron-hole separation, but also is convenient for recycle. The specific photocatalysis, optical properties and photogenerated electron-hole transmission mechanism are discussed in detail. The improved photocatalysis performance of the MoS2/SnO2/CC suggests the possibilities of developing the multi-layer heterostructure for further photocatalysis applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Perovskite solar cell (PSC) was fabricated in ambient atmospheric conditions with carbon as counter electrode (CE). 5-Ammonium valeric acid iodide (5-AVAI) cation was synthesized and used as an additive in the perovskite precursor. The light absorber, perovskite precursor was infiltrated on to the TiO2/ZrO2/Carbon layer and annealed at 60 degrees C for 30 min. The perovskite layer was characterized by Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, and optical microscope analysis. The carbon perovskite solar cell was characterized by Photocurrent-Voltage (J-V) measurement and Incident Photon to Current Conversion Efficiency (IPCE) measurement. The device power conversion efficiency of the perovskite solar cell was found to be 6.6% with an active area of 0.25 cm(2). The lifetime of electron injection is found to be 2.5 ms, which is noticed from, bode plot. From electrochemical impedance spectrum, lower charge transport resistance (R-ct) is observed at the interface of perovskite/carbon CE. The shelf-life of the device was investigated under ambient condition and its performance remains over similar to 90% even after 75 days. This triple layer device architecture shows a hopeful photovoltaic technology towards commercialization. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study reports the decoration of zinc oxide (ZnO) nanosheets with copper indium sulfide (CuInS2 ) via sequential metal deposition and post sulfurization methods for photoelectrochemical solar cell application. The three dimensional (3D) ZnO nanosheets are hydrothermally grown on conductive glass substrates by chemical bath deposition. Then, copper/indium metallic alloy is deposited via magnetron sputtering and annealed at high temperature in the presence of elemental sulfur to form CuInS2 absorber on the surface of 3D nanosheets. Photoelectrochemical measurements indicate that the decoration of CuInS2 layer over the ZnO nanosheets results in significant increase in the photocurrent density to 28 mA cm(-2) (at 0.5 V vs Ag/AgCl) leading a remarkable amount of hydrogen generation during solar water splitting process, 1387 mu mol measured at 0 V vs Ag/AgCl under 1 sun-illumination for 4 h.

AB B-site complex perovskite Ba(Zr0.1Ti0.9)O-3 microcrystals at micron size with a plate-like shape was successfully synthesized using topochemical microcrystal conversion and molten salt method. A plate-like Bi-4(Zr0.1Ti0.9)(3)O-12 precursor was first synthesized by Zr4+ substitution of Ti4+ using molten salt. Then plate-like 4-9 mu m Ba(Zr0.1Ti0.9)O-3 microcrystals with an average thickness <500 nm were synthesized by mixing BaCO3, Bi-4(Zr0.1Ti0.9)(3)O-12, and KCl molten salt at 800 degrees C. Finally, the topochemical microcrystal conversion reaction between BaCO3 and Bi-4(Zr0.1Ti0.9)(3)O-12 precursor was carried out. The results pave the way for fabricating plate-like B-site complex perovskite microcrystals. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The oxygen content in mixed-conducting perovskite-type Ca0.25Sr0.75Fe0.75Mo0.25O3-delta was measured as a function of oxygen partial pressure varying in the range 10(-21)-0.5 atm at temperature 750-950 degrees C by coulometric titration technique. The experimental data were satisfactorily simulated with a defect equilibrium model involving reactions of iron oxidation, charge disproportionation on Fe sites, and electron exchange between iron and molybdenum. A comparison of the obtained results with similar data for SrFe0.75Mo0.25O3-delta has shown that calcium substitution provides no observable effect on standard enthalpy and entropy of disproportionation and electron exchange reactions, but decrease standard enthalpy and increase standard entropy of the oxidation reaction, resulting in an almost tenfold decrease in the respective equilibrium constant. A decrease in the concentration of p-type carriers and an increase in the concentration of n-type carriers were revealed in response to calcium substitution for strontium in SrFe0.75Mo0.25O3-delta.

SO MATERIALS LETTERS
LA English
DT Article
DE Surfaces; Biomimetic; Interfaces
AB Filter paper (FP) with superhydrophobicity and high water adhesion was prepared by adsorption and simple immersion process. The surface morphologies displayed the micro-nano structure of FP. The surfaces composition was investigated by Fourier transform IR, X-ray photoelectron spectrum and X-ray diffractometer. The superhydrophobic surfaces with a water contact angle of 153 degrees benefited from the Fe(OH)(3) nanostructure formed on FP and subsequent stearic acid (STA) modification. The as-prepared superhydrophobic surfaces could firmly pin the water droplet even when the surfaces turned upside down. The wettability properties of the FP surfaces could be repaired by immersing the damaged samples into the solution again. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO MATERIALS LETTERS

   deposition; Buffer layer; Thin films; Solar energy materials
AB Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have recently demonstrated high efficiencies of over 23%, but the stability is still a major challenge for commercialization. Here, we demonstrate that the decomposition of organo-metal halide perovskite and the corrosion of silver electrode caused by the participation of water in the prepared inverted triple cation PSCs is an important factor for cell performance degradation. Through deeply analyzing the degradation mechanism, it is found that moisture ingress and diffusion of halide ions are the main reasons for the metal-contact-induced degradation process. In order to suppress the degradation, we find that inserting a pinhole-free ultrathin TiO2 layer grown by atomic layer deposition between the electrode and absorber layer is an effective strategy, which can significantly improve the environmental stability of the PSCs.

SO MATERIALS LETTERS

DE Carbon nanotubes; Carbon materials; Electrochemical performance;
   Metal-organic framework; Supercapacitors
AB A new kind of metal-organic framework (MOF) was firstly explored to successfully derive the carbon nanotubes material. The in-situ growth carbon nanotubes deriving from MOFs were used as an all-solid-state supercapacitor for the first time and exhibited a high electrochemical performance. High specific capacitances of 272 and 168 mFcm (2) can be achieved at 0.5 and 10 mAcm (2), respectively. A high retention value of 100% was kept even after 5000 charge and discharge cycles. Such a high electrochemical performance may be due to the intrinsic properties of the MOF-derived carbon materials, such as high surface area, uniformly porous structure and high electronic conductivity. The present study provided a new kind of MOF precursor to generate the carbon nanotubes material and demonstrated that the MOF-derived carbon nanotubes material may be a promising candidate for all-solid-state supercapacitors in future.

AB Most of the polymer coatings are directly exposed to sunlight, leading to serious degradation on their surfaces. Functional triazine ultraviolet absorber (FT-UVA) with surface enrichment property was synthesized. The surface enrichment property of FT-UVA in coating surfaces was investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and attenuated total reflection Fourier-transform infrared spectrometry (ATR-IR). Contact angle measurements suggest that the enrichment of FT-UVAs on coating surface yielded a hydrophobic film. The effective protection of FT-UVA for PVC coating was investigated by artificial accelerated aging test. The calculation of dynamic process was conducted to gain insights into the surface enrichment mechanism of FT-UVA in coating. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Worms-like TiO2 nanostructures were synthesized by microwave assisted solvothermal synthesis by simple chemical modification method using urea. Characteristic anatase TiO2 peaks were confirmed using X-ray diffraction analysis. Optical properties were studied using UV-visible diffuse reflectance and photoluminescence spectroscopy. Optical studies of the prepared material revealed characteristic wide bandgap semiconductor properties. FESEM and TEM images confirmed the presence of nanostructures in the prepared samples. The mesoporous nature of the prepared TiO2 nanostructures was confirmed using BET isotherm. Chemical composition and the respective oxidation states of TiO2 were studied using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The prepared TiO2 nanostructures were coated as a light scattering layer over the active layer of the photoanode and its performance was studied. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE Split-and-merge; Projection; K-means; Density curve
ID NUMBER; EM; MIXTURES
AB A novel split-and-merge clustering algorithm is proposed by using projection technology and K-means method. There are two key technologies in the proposed method: shape recognition based on projection and split-and-merge process based on K-means. By projecting the data onto the connection of any two cluster centers, no matter how large the dimension of data is, we can always obtain an one-dimension density curve of the projection to guarantee an acceptable amount of calculation. Further embedded the kernel density estimate, we can determine the distribution of clusters by the shape of the one-dimensional density curve. In the split-and-merge process, this algorithm not only addresses the sensitivity in selecting initial cluster centers, but also automatically give a reasonable number of clusters. We also discuss the possibility to extend the projection split-and-merge method from K-means to density based methods (as EM algorithm and Cross-entropy clustering). Both simulation and real data experimental results show that our method performance well especially under strict data conditions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Industrial bioprocesses development nowadays is concerned with producing chemicals using yeast, bacteria and therapeutic proteins in mammalian cells. This involves the utilization of microorganism cells as factories and re-engineering them in silico. The tools that could facilitate this process are known as the kinetic models. Kinetic models of cellular metabolism are important in assisting researchers to understand the rational design of biological systems, predicting metabolites production, and improving bio-products development. However, the most challenging task in model development is parameter estimation, which is the process of identifying an unknown value of model parameters which provides the best fit between the model output and a set of experimental data. Due to the increased complexity and high dimensionality of the models, which are extremely nonlinear and contain large numbers of kinetic parameters, parameter estimation is known to be difficult and time-consuming. This study proposes a cooperative enhanced scatter search with opposition-based learning schemes (CeSSOL) for parameter estimation in large-scale biology models. The method was executed in parallel with the proposed cooperative mechanism in order to exchange information (kinetic parameters) between individual threads. Each thread consists of different parameters settings that enhance the systemic properties in obtaining the global minimum. The performance of the proposed method was assessed against two large-scale microorganisms models using mammalian and bacteria cells. The results revealed that the proposed method recorded faster computation time compared to other methods. The study has also demonstrated that the proposed method can be used to provide more accurate and faster estimation of kinetic models, indicating the potential benefits of utilizing this method for expert systems of industrial biotechnology.

AB Doehlert design and desirability function were used in the optimization of an ultrasound assisted dissolution method of fish fillet samples with tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide (TMAH) for the determination of Ca, Fe, Zn and Mg by flame atomic absorption spectrometry. The variables values after optimization were 620 mu L (volume of TMAH), 25 min (sonication time) and 46 degrees C (bath temperature). The quantification limits for Ca, Mg, Fe and Zn were 56, 107, 23 and 2.9 mu g g(-1), respectively. Accuracy was evaluated by comparing the results generated from the analysis of the samples treated by the proposed method and by wet digestion. Additionally, accuracy for Fe and Zn was assessed by the analysis of certified reference materials Tort-3 (Lobster hepatopancreas), ERM-CE 278 (mussel tissue) and Dolt-4 (Fish liver). There were no significant differences between the results obtained at a 95% confidence level when results were evaluated by t-test application.

AB Wet salting is an old preservation method however the NaCl has been frequently associated to high blood pressure issues. The KCl has been used as partial replacement without affecting the acceptability of the final product. In this study, the simultaneous diffusion of NaCl and KCl in champignon mushrooms in static brine and brine under agitation was modeled based on the generalization of Fick's second diffusion law and simulated using the finite element method. Main and crossed diffusion coefficients, as well as the Biot number, were determined using the super modified simplex optimization method by means of percentage error minimization. Deviations between the simulated and experimental data were 5.78% for NaCl and 4.78% for KCl in static brine and 4.95% for NaCl and 4.35% for KCl in brine with agitation and, the main diffusion coefficients 2.692 x 10(-10) m(2) s(-1) for sodium and 2.953 x 10(-10) m(2) s(-1) for potassium were obtained.

AB This work describes the application of an experimental design in optimizing the decomposition and spectrometer operational conditions for analysis of fish feeds. The content of 22 elements (six macroelements, four microelements and eleven trace elements) in feeds for fishes (ornamental and for human consumption) was determined by inductively coupled plasma (ICP)-based methods. Limits of quantification were obtained and the values ranged between 0.02 mg kg(-1) (Cd) and 76 mg kg-1 (Al). Evaluation of the methods was achieved through analysis of standard reference material, Oyster Tissue (NIST 1566b) and Tea (NCS DC 73351). Element concentrations in feed samples for ornamental fish ranged from < 0.02 mg kg(-1) (Cd) to 2.79% (P) and for fish breeding for human consumption from < 0.02 mg kg(-1) (Cd) to 2.00% (Ca). The concentrations of the elements obtained in the analyzed fish feeds were within the limits established by Brazilian and American legislation for regulated elements.

AB A microwave-assisted digestion procedure using diluted HNO3 and H2O2 was developed for multi-element determination in guarana samples by ICP OES. Optimization step was performed employing a mixture design with pseudocomponents using HNO3, H2O2 and H2O. The analytical signal of each element, residual acidity and residual carbon content were optimized simultaneously using the desirability function. The best condition for digestion of a 250 mg sample mass resulted from a mixture constituted by 1.0 mL of HNO3, 3.0 mL of H2O2 and 6.0 mL of H2O. This condition allowed final digests with residual acidity and residual carbon content of 0.4 mol L-1 and 6.5%, respectively. The method was validated and applied for the determination of K, Ca, Mg, S, P, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn in 72 guarana seed samples from Bahia state. This work presents unpublished results about the mineral composition of guarana seed samples produced in Bahia state, Brazil.

AB Sweet potato is a food consumed in the world. In this work, the minerals and centesimal composition in sweet potatoes of organic and conventional cultivars was investigated. The accuracy was confirmed with a certified reference material of apple leaves (NIST 1515). The quantification of the samples was performed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry and the digestion efficiency was evaluated by residual carbon content. The mean concentrations (in mg/100 g) of minerals were: 23.5 and 40.7 (Ca); 0.082 and 0.159 (Cu); 0.303 and 0.481 (Fe); 197 and 381 (K); 166 and 35.7 (Mg); 0.183 and 1.15 (Mn); 68.6 and 0.433 (Na); 54.1 and 62.2 (P) and 0.197 and 0.261 (Zn) for conventional and organic cultivars, respectively. Average centesimal concentrations in conventional and organic cultivars (in %), were: 72 and 72 (moisture); 0.87 and 0.90 (ashes); 1.5 and 1.4 (proteins); 0.63 and 0.54 (lipids) and 24.8 and 23.9 (carbohydrates).

AB Poorly formulated probiotic supplements intended for oral administration often fail to protect bacteria from the challenges of human digestion, meaning bacteria do not reach the small intestine in a viable state. As a result, the ability of probiotics to influence the human gut microbiota has not been proven. Here we show how (i) considered formulation of an aqueous probiotic suspension can facilitate delivery of viable probiotic bacteria to the gut and (ii) quantitate the effect of colonisation and proliferation of specific probiotic species on the human gut microbiota, using an in-vitro gut model. Our data revealed immediate colonisation and growth of three probiotic species in the luminal and mucosal compartments of the proximal and distal colon, and growth of a fourth species in the luminal proximal colon, leading to higher proximal and distal colonic lactate concentrations. The lactate stimulated growth of lactate-consuming bacteria, altering the bacterial diversity of the microbiota and resulting in increased short-chain fatty acid production, especially butyrate. Additionally, an immunomodulatory effect of the probiotics was seen; production of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and IL-10) was increased and production of inflammatory chemokines (MCP-1, CXCL 10 and IL-8.) was reduced. The results indicate that the probiotic species alone do not result in a clinical effect; rather, they facilitate modulation of the gut microbiota composition and metabolic activity thereby influencing the immune response.

AB The aim of this study is to improve the bioavailability of ticagrelor, BCS class 4 drug, using solid dispersion technique, and to evaluate the potential of ticagrelor loaded-solid dispersion, as a new formulation. The solid dispersion formulation was prepared via solvent evaporation method using ethanol. TPGS and Neusilin (R) US2 selected via screening studies were used for preparing formulation. The results of scanning electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry and powder X-ray diffraction showed that the crystallinity of the ticagrelor was completely transformed to an amorphous form and maintained in the solid dispersion formulation. The released amount of the optimized solid dispersion significantly increased by 2.2-and 34-fold in comparison with physical mixture (Ticagrelor: TPGS: Neusilin (R) US2 = 1: 2: 2, w/w/w) and commercial product (Brilinta (R)) in distilled water at 90 min, respectively. The absorptive permeability was improved (1.4-fold) and the efflux ratio was decreased (0.45-fold) by formulation containing TPGS acting as a P-gp inhibitor compared to pure drug. The solid dispersion formulation improved the peak plasma concentration (C-max) and relative bioavailability compared to that of pure drug as 238.09 +/- 25.96% and 219.78 +/- 36.33%, respectively, after oral administration in rats. Thus, we successfully prepared the solid dispersion formulation for enhancing oral bioavailability of ticagrelor, and then this formulation would be recommended as a practical oral pharmaceutical product.

AB Increasing the dissolution rate of poorly water-soluble active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) is a key strategy used for improving their oral bioavailability. One of the formulation approaches is API loading to mesoporous carrier particles, which can increase the dissolution rate through the combination of improved powder wett-ability and dispersion, higher surface area, and API conversion from crystalline to the amorphous state. From the formulation process point of view, the maximum achievable drug loading is a crucial parameter, which depends on the loading method. Drug loading by sorption from a solution is a technologically attractive approach, since it involves familiar unit operations (mixing, filtration, drying). However, the success of the equilibrium sorption approach depends on the choice of the solvent. In this work we present an experimental study of loading efficiency to mesoporous silica particles, based on a set of 10 APIs combined with 6 different solvents at a range of concentrations. We show that due to the competitive nature of the adsorption process, the solvent with the highest API solubility is not necessarily the best candidate for maximising the API loading. Based on the investigated drug-solvent combinations, we show that the dielectric constant of the solvent is a good predictor of loading efficiency and can be used as a general guideline for solvent selection. On the other hand, we did not find any systematic correlation between commonly measured API properties such as logP and their loading efficiency.

AB Clinical resistance to drugs and diminution in their side effects have become great issues for pharmacologists. In veterinary medicine, parasites like Trichomonas gallinae are of veterinary, hygienic and economic importance and can be treated by metronidazole. Unfortunately, scientific evidence has been reported about its resistance and serious side effects in trichomoniasis. In this research, it was attempted to introduce a new procedure to lower side effects of the drug molecules and also, enhance the treatment of disease. Whisker-formed SBA-15 nano-particles were utilized for the first time in this issue. They had mesoporous structures which metronidazole molecules could be trapped in them. Additionally, these crystalline nanowhiskers were modified with tannic acid to make the release process better. The branches of tannic acid covered the opening of pores in crystalline SBA-15 nanowhiskers and restricted the drug from fast release. It caused a controlled metronidazole release in the smart drug delivery. These nanocarriers were completely tested by several experiments. Whisker-like SBA-15 nanocrystals had a mesopore volume of 0.5931 cm(3)/g, pore diameter of 6.06 nm and surface area of 491.38m(2)/g. Based on TGA analysis, 10% of tannic acid was coated on the crystalline nanowhiskers during the modification. The metronidazole content and entrapment efficiency of final nanocarriers was 28.56% and 71.40%, respectively. The decomposition of tannic acid in lower pHs made whisker-like SBA-15@tannic acid nanocrystals be pH-responsive which can be used for other applications in the pharmacology. In-vitro study revealed that the minimal lethal concentration of nanocarriers was 0.5 mg/mL for 180 min.

AB This study explored the transition of lamellar-type liquid crystal (LLC) to biocompatible oil-in-water nanoemulsions able to modify benznidazole (BNZ) release and target the drug to cells infected with the T. cruzi parasite. Three cosolvents (2methylpyrrolidone [NMP], polyethylene glycol [POL], and propylene glycol [PRO] were tested to induce the transition of anisotropic LLC systems to isotropic nanoemulsions. Mixtures of soy phosphatidylcholine with sodium oleate stabilized the dispersions of medium chain triglyceride in water. Rheological measurements, polarized microscopy, and small angle X-ray scattering demonstrated that there is a phase transition from LLC to desired nanoemulsions. These small and narrow droplet-sized nanocarriers exhibited some advantages and promising features, such as the enhanced BNZ aqueous solubility and slow drug release rate. In vitro cell biocompatibility of formulations was assessed in the Vero E6 and SiHa cell lines. Drug-loaded nanoemulsions inhibited the epimastigote growth of the T. cruzi parasite (IC50 0.208 +/- 0.052 mu g mL(-1)) and reduced its infective life form trypomastigote (IC50 0.392 +/- 0.107 mu g mL(-1)). The oil-in-water nanoemulsions were demonstrated as promising biocompatible liquid drug delivery systems capable of improving the BNZ trypanocidal activity for the treatment of Chagas disease.

AB Transdermal drug delivery (TDDS) has been highly explored in the past couple of decades due to benefits such as increased patient compliance, improved drug release, tissue targeting, avoiding the presystemic metabolism in the liver etc. However, the stratum corneum poses as the rate limiting barrier to the permeation of drugs through the skin, which has been a continuous challenge in TDDS. This review covers the various types of nanoparticles and nanoemulsions that are currently being investigated for TDDS applications, desirable physical and chemical characteristics of these systems, their routes of penetration through the skin, and summarizes recent advances using these systems in treating conditions such as alopecia, wound healing, psoriasis, and melanoma. Additionally, synergistic effect of iontophoresis and mechanical force mediated drug delivery will be reviewed.

AB The first objective of this study was to optimize a supersaturatable self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery system (SSNEDDS) containing silymarin through the investigation of the single and synergistic effect of either SNEDDS or a precipitation inhibitor on dissolution efficiency (DE) of silymarin. The bioavailability and hepatoprotective activity of S-SNEDDS were then compared to those of a branded product (Legalon (R), Meda). SNEDDS containing silymarin was developed by titration technique, and Poloxamer 407 was selected as the optimal precipitation inhibitor by using casting film and solvent-shift method. The interaction of silybin (the major active constituent of silymarin) and the polymer was then determined by differential scanning calorimetry, powder X-ray diffractometry (PXRD), Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy and H-1 NMR analysis. The combination of two techniques including SNEDDS and addition of 10% of Poloxamer 407 remarkably increased DE4h (88.28%) compared to the reference product (6.41%). The relative bioavailability of S-SNEDDS versus Legalon (R) was about 760%. The hepatoprotective activity of S-SNEDDS in CCl4-induced mice was also superior to the commercial product in declining both the levels of serum transaminases (ALT, AST) and lipid peroxidation as well as glutathione and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities under tested doses calculated as silybin (10, 25 and 50 mg/kg). These biopharmaceutical and pharmacological advantages of S-SNEDDS indicated prospects in the development of a novel product that offers lower strength of silymarin while enhancing therapeutic outcomes.

AB Glioblastoma is one of the most rapaciously growing cancer within the brain with an average lifespan of 12-15 months (5-year survival < 3-4%). Doxorubicin (DOX) is clinically utilized as a first line drug in the treatment of Glioblastoma, however, its restricted entry into the brain via the blood-brain barrier (BBB), limited blood-tumor barrier (BTB) permeability, hemotoxicity, short mean half-life of 1-3 hr as well as rapid body clearance results in tremendously diminished bioactivity in glioblastoma. Dendrimer-Cationized-Albumin (dCatAlb) was synthesized following the carboxyl activation technique and the synthesized biopolymer was characterized by FTIR, MALDI-TOF and zeta potential. The prepared dCatAlb was encrusted on DOX-loaded PLGA nanoparticle core to develop a novel hybrid DOX nanoformulation (dCatAlb-pDNP; particle size: 156 +/- 10.85 nm; (sic): -10.0 +/- 2.1 mV surface charge). The formulated dCatAlb-pDNP showed a unique pH-dependent DOX release profile, diminished hemolytic toxicity, higher drug uptake (< 0.001) and cytotoxicity in U87MG glioblastoma cells, increase levels of caspase-3 gene in U87MG cells (approximately 5.35-fold higher) inferred that anticancer activity is primarily taking place through caspase-mediated apoptosis mechanism. The developed novel DOX nanoformulation also showed superior trans-epithelial permeation transport across monolayer bEnd. 3 cells as well as notable biocompatibility and stability. The dCatAlb-pDNP showed enhanced BBB permeation efficacy as confirmed permeation assay in bEnd. 3 cell-based model. The long-term formulation stability of developed nanoformulations was studied by storing them at 5 +/- 2 degrees C and 30 +/- 2 degrees C/60 +/- 5% Relative Humidity (% RH) in the stability chamber for a period of 60 days (ICHQ1A (R2)). The outcomes of this investigation evidently indicate that dCatAlb-pDNP offers superior anticancer activity of DOX in glioblastoma cells while significantly improving its BBB permeation. The developed formulation is a biocompatible, safer and commercially viable approach to delivering DOX selectively in sustained manner glioblastoma while countering its hemolytic toxic effect, which is a major ongoing issue with conventional DOX injectable available in the market today.

AB Water is often readily absorbed by amorphous compounds, lowering their glass transition temperature (T-g) and facilitating their recrystallization (via nucleation-and-growth). At the same time, the increase in moisture content translates to a decrease in both the thermodynamic solubility and intrinsic dissolution rate, as compared to the corresponding dry (pure) amorphous phase, e.g. see [Murdande SB, Pikal MJ, Shanker RM, Bogner RH. 2010. Solubility advantage of amorphous pharmaceuticals: I. A thermodynamic analysis. J Pharm Sci 99:1254-1264.]. In the case of pure indomethacin and felodipine, the solubility advantage of each amorphous phase over its crystalline counterpart were previously determined to be 7.6 and 4.7, respectively, using a new methodology together with basic calorimetric data taken from the literature. Herein, we demonstrate that, theoretically, following the uptake of just similar to 0.5% w/w water, the solubility ratios decrease to 6.9 and 4.5, in the same order. Moreover, as the predicted intrinsic dissolution rate (based on the Noyes-Whitney equation) is directly proportional to the solubility advantage of a given amorphous-crystalline pair, it decreases proportionately upon moisture uptake. Applying the methodology presented herein, one can directly predict the extent of T-g-lowering observed at any moisture content, for a given amorphous phase. Knowing that value, it is possible to estimate the relative decrease in the solubility and/or intrinsic dissolution rate of the plasticized phase compared to the pure glass, and vice-versa.

AB The future of pharmaceutical manufacturing may be significantly transformed by 3-dimensional (3D) printing. As an emerging technology, the indicators of quality for materials and processes used in 3D printing have not been fully established. The objective of this study was to identify the critical material attributes of semisolid paste formulations filled into cartridges for 3D printing of personalized medicine. Nineteen semisolid formulations were prepared per a fractional factorial design with three replicates of the center point. The variables investigated included percent loading of API and various soluble and insoluble excipients. Pastes were characterized for viscoelastic characteristics during the 3D printing process including creep recovery, cross-modulus and extrudability models. Packing efficiency of pastes into 3D printing cartridges was also evaluated by X-ray tomography. Changes in composition of 3D printing pastes resulted in significant variations in their viscoelastic parameters, namely their elastic deformation, flow and relaxation behaviors. The percent of soluble excipients incorporated was the most significant factor affecting the creep behavior of pastes. Cross-over stresses were assessed to indicate the minimum pressure needed for the pastes to initiate flow. Increasing solid and swellable contents of the pastes from 7% to 63% w/w increased significantly (p < 0.05) the cross-over stress from 0.93x10(-3) Pa to 9.47x10(-3) Pa. Increasing soluble ingredients of paste from 30% to 80% w/w was found to increase flow of the paste from 0.41x10(-3) to 3.85x10(-3) %/ s. X-ray tomography images revealed inclusion of air bubbles during packing of pastes into cartridges. These bubbles may affect the relaxation behavior of the pastes; hence bubbles should be eliminated. This study unveiled the critical material attributes that could be controlled for consistent 3D printing by microextrusion.

AB Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is considered to be an unsuitable carrier for hot-melt extrusion (HME) due to its low processability. In this study, we focused on a lowly hydrolyzed PVA (JR-05, 70.0-74.0% hydrolyzed, L-PVA) to evaluate the potential use of L-PVA as a carrier for HME using the Hoftyzer and Krevelen method and thermodynamic models. These evaluations for drug-polymer systems based on the Flory-Huggins theory predicted the physicochemical properties of the solubility and miscibility between indomethacin (IND) and PVAs. Prior to initiating formulation studies, construction of IND and PVA phase diagrams provided guidance for design process conditions in HME. On the basis of the results of the validation studies, a conventional grade of PVA (JP-05, 87.0-89.0% hydrolyzed) is unlikely to be suitable as a carrier of HME due to its low plasticity, resulting in rapid recrystallization in the evaluation of in vitro dissolution and stability caused by poor miscibility. On the other hand, JR-05 demonstrated high processability, leading to the preparation of miscible extrudate with a high stability and an excellent in vitro dissolution profile due to its unique micelle-forming capability. These findings suggest that L-PVA brings about new carrier options among non-ionic polymers for HME.

AB In the present study, a multi-system for solid dispersion (SD) of celecoxib (CXB) was designed to improve its solubility and anti-inflammatory effects in vitro as well as oral absorption in rats. The SD formulations were prepared by a solvent evaporation with a multi-system as the solubilizer; an alkalizer; and fumed silica (Aerosil (R) 200). The physicochemical properties of the SD formulations were evaluated. Polyoxyl 15 hydroxystearate (HS 15 (R)) was chosen as the solubilizer based on the apparent solubility test. The optimal SD formulation (SD6, CXB: HS 15 (R) : K30 (R) : meglumine: Aerosil (R) 200 = 200: 50: 50: 100: 100, weight ratio) improved the dissolution (%) over 2-fold compared to that by the commercial product (Celebrex (R)) at pH 1.2, in distilled water (DW), and in a pH 6.8 buffer (sodium lauryl sulfate [SLS], 0.25% w/v). The SD6 formulation altered physical properties such as crystallinity, thermal stability, and intra-molecular interaction. Moreover, SD6 showed a good stability for 6 months. The anti-inflammatory effect of SD6 significantly improved 2.2-fold compared to that of Celebrex (R) in the cell study. The relative bioavailability (BA) of SD6 was significantly improved to 209.4% compared to that of Celebrex (R). In conclusion, intra-molecular interactions between CXB and solubilizers in multi-systems increase its solubility, dissolution (%), anti-inflammatory effects in vitro, and the relative BA (%) in rats. Thus, SD6 would be effective for the treatment of inflammation in rats and should be evaluated in detail in future clinical studies.

AB Biopolymeric films can be used as dressings for the treatment of skin burns and other chronic wounds. The healing properties of these films may be enhanced by the addition of Copaiba oil (Copaifera L.) which properties have already been well-described. The aim of this study was to evaluate the addition of Copaiba oil in chitosan films prepared by casting solvent evaporation technique using chitosan solution (2% or 1% wt/wt) and Copaiba oil (0.1 or 1.0% wt/wt) at different concentrations. Films were characterized by color analysis, scanning electron microscopy, mechanical properties, thermal analysis, and fluid handling capacity. The developed films demonstrated potential for wound dressing, translated by the fluid handling capacity similar to that of commercial dressings. While no surfactant was present in the formulation, the droplets of Copaiba oil were well-dispersed and homogeneously distributed in the chitosan matrix even after drying. The thermal analysis translated the occurrence of interactions between the oil and chitosan.
