AB The emergence of novel and powerful digital technologies, digital platforms and digital infrastructures has transformed innovation and entrepreneurship in significant ways. Beyond simply opening new opportunities for innovators and entrepreneurs, digital technologies have broader implications for value creation and value capture. Research aimed at understanding the digital transformation of the economy needs to incorporate multiple and cross-levels of analysis, embrace ideas and concepts from multiple fields/disciplines, and explicitly acknowledge the role of digital technologies in transforming organizations and social relationships. To help realize this research agenda, we identify three key themes related to digitization-openness, affordances, and generativity-and, outline broad research issues relating to each. We suggest that such themes that are innate to digital technologies could serve as a common conceptual platform that allows for connections between issues at different levels as well as the integration of ideas from different disciplines/areas. We then summarize the contributions of the 11 papers presented in this Special Issue relating them to one or more of these themes and outlining their implications for future research.

AB Digital platforms are an organizational form made up of a technological architecture and governance mechanisms for managing autonomous complementors. A platform's success depends on their engagement in value creation and capture. Prior studies of such engagement have mainly focused on a platform's governance mechanisms without recognizing their interdependence to its technological architecture. There is therefore a limited understanding of how the interplay between governance and architecture configures platform organizations, and why these configurations produce different levels of complementor engagement. In this paper, our analysis of a 12-year study of a shared platform initiative yields three configurations of platform organizations: vertical, horizontal, and modular. Based on these configurations, we develop propositions that theorize the implications of these organizational forms for complementor engagement. We further propose that these insights, which we derive from a shared platform, are particularly relevant for blockchain-based platforms.

AB Organizations build strategic alliances with other firms with the intent of tapping into partners' resources and capturing long-term value from these relationships. Such partnerships are typically governed by contractual or equity arrangements with clear mutual obligations. More recently, however, organizations have begun to seek strategic partnerships with open innovation communities, which are novel digitally enabled forms of organizing, and where contractual commitments are not possible. Thus, selecting the right open innovation community as an alliance partner becomes a more complex decision. We follow how the organizational decision makers, in two technology firms that were pioneers of forming strategic alliances with open innovation communities, developed metrics around making such decisions. We build upon Shah and Swaminathan's (2008) contingency model of alliance partner selection and consider how it applies to the case of partnering with open innovation communities. This framework was useful in to frame our findings, yet our work recognizes and builds upon two key differences: 1) the evaluation metrics used in selecting an open innovation community were more focused on value creation than value capture; and 2) open ecosystem considerations, and not just partner-specific metrics, featured prominently in this type of alliance partner evaluation. We develop the notions of community and ecosystem health to refer to these new metrics.

AB Digital-technology usage in dynamic and complex work practices is a core phenomenon in innovation research. There are, however, few detailed analyses of how people organize the use of digital tools in their work practices. We aim to offer more insight into how individual actors use digital technology, how these actors organize its use in collectives, and how they organize their work with that of other actors in order to realize collective-level goals. We implemented a qualitative research design, based on interviews in architectural firms complemented with observations and archival data. By analyzing interactions of multiple individual actors with digital technology, we found that actors organize usage in collectives through activities that we call configuring-in-use and reflecting; and that they combine these two organizational activities in order to realize collective-level goals. We identify the combination of these organizational activities as configurational usage. We contribute to literature on the usage of pervasive digital technology by providing a detailed empirical investigation of organized usage of digital technology. Furthermore, we refine the conceptualization of configurational usage, improving understanding of core processes of digital innovation.

ID ACCESS; IMPACT
AB Equity crowdfunding platforms are at the center of the digital transformation of early-stage venture funding. These digital platforms were originally heralded as a democratizing force in early stage finance, due to their role in facilitating the exchange between entrepreneurs and a multitude of non-professional small investors ("the crowd"). Equity crowdfunding platforms have experienced considerable growth and now attract professional investors including business angels. The presence of angels alongside the crowd on equity crowdfunding platforms has raised questions whether these digital platforms can continue to play their role in democratizing access to capital. Using data from a leading equity crowdfunding platform, we examine the interplay between the investment decisions of angels and the crowd. We find evidence of information flows in crowdfunding platforms between angels, and from angels to the crowd. We find angels play an important role in funding of large ventures, whereas the crowd not only fill the funding gaps for such large ventures but also play a pivotal role in the funding of small ones. The complementarity between angels and crowd investors seems to increase the overall efficiency in an otherwise highly asymmetric and uncertain market, confirming that digitization can indeed bring important benefits to venture investment.

AB Ratings by users on various items such as products and services have become easily available on the Web. Also available in many cases, in addition to an overall rating for each item by each user, are multicriteria ratings from different viewpoints. Our previous study showed that multicriteria rating approaches performed better than single-criterion ones for both recommendation and rating aggregation. We have now formulated a Bayesian probabilistic model for multicriteria evaluation as an alternative to low-rank approximation. We evaluated the performance of this model, in which model capacity is controlled by integrating over all model parameters, and investigated whether it can be made to work more efficiently by using a Markov chain Monte Carlo method for both recommendation and rating aggregation. It performed better than low-rank approximation methods that obtain a maximum a posteriori estimate by fitting to the data. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Motor imagery (MI)-related brain activities can be effectively described by frequency analysis. Bispectrum is developed to overcome the drawback of power spectrum that the estimation of power spectrum discards the phase relationship among frequency components. However, the widely used bispectral features extraction method adds up all bispectral values as one feature, which could lead to the loss of effective information and increase of the sensitivity to non-linear and non-Gaussian noises. Thus, the representative bispectral features extraction method may be inefficient for MI classification. In addition, recent research suggests that the variations of EEG signals could provide more useful underlying information of event-related brain responses. This paper presents an advanced variations based bispectral feature extraction method to improve the performance of MI classification. The proposed method calculates the variations of MI-related EEG signals as input to bispectrum estimation. Besides, a new segmented bispectral sum features are developed to reduce the influence of non-linear and non-Gaussian noises and emphasize the valuable information for MI classification. The dataset collected in our laboratory and BCI Competition IV dataset 2b were adopted to validate the proposed method. The results indicate that the proposed method outperforms the power spectrum based methods and the representative bispectral features based methods. Moreover, compared to other state-of-the-art works, our approach also achieves the greater performance for MI classification. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID COMBINING MULTIPLE CLASSIFIERS; RECOGNITION; DIVERSITY
AB Classification is a special type of machine learning tasks, which is essentially achieved by training a classifier that can be used to classify new instances. In order to train a high performance classifier, it is crucial to extract representative features from raw data, such as text and images. In reality, instances could be highly diverse even if they belong to the same class, which indicates different instances of the same class could represent very different characteristics. For example, in a facial expression recognition task, some instances may be better described by Histogram of Oriented Gradients features, while others may be better presented by Local Binary Patterns features. From this point of view, it is necessary to adopt ensemble learning to train different classifiers on different feature sets and to fuse these classifiers towards more accurate classification of each instance. On the other hand, different algorithms are likely to show different suitability for training classifiers on different feature sets. It shows again the necessity to adopt ensemble learning towards advances in the classification performance. Furthermore, a multi-class classification task would become increasingly more complex when the number of classes is increased, i.e. it would lead to the increased difficulty in terms of discriminating different classes. In this paper, we propose an ensemble learning framework that involves transforming a multi-class classification task into a number of binary classification tasks and fusion of classifiers trained on different feature sets by using different learning algorithms. We report experimental studies on a UCI data set on Sonar and the CK+ data set on facial expression recognition. The results show that our proposed ensemble learning approach leads to considerable advances in classification performance, in comparison with popular learning approaches including decision tree ensembles and deep neural networks. In practice, the proposed approach can be used effectively to build an ensemble of ensembles acting as a group of expert systems, which show the capability to achieve more stable performance of pattern recognition, in comparison with building a single classifier that acts as a single expert system.

DT Review
ID GABOR FILTER; VERIFICATION; INFORMATION; EXTRACTION
AB Latent palmprint identification is a crucial element for both law enforcement and integrated automated fingerprint identification systems because approximately 30% of the imprints found in a crime scene originate from a human's palms. To find the person whom the palmprint belongs to, forensic experts use systems that automatically compare the imprints found, called latent, against thousands of potential palmprints.
   Identification systems rely on features obtained from the palmprint, and different feature representations to include discriminative information. However, there is no consensus as to which representation allows for a better matching between latent palmprints, and those with a known identity. Furthermore, evaluating the identification performance when matching palmprints obtained when using different representations has not been done fairly. The current manner of evaluating palmprint identification methods uses different datasets, performance measures, and does not allow to discern the contributions of the feature representation and the methods for matching the palmprints. In this study, we have reviewed those features used for latent palmprint identification, and also we propose an evaluation methodology that allows for a fair comparison of minutiae-based features.
   Using our methodology, we evaluated each representation performing more than 5 billion comparisons. Our experiments are done using a dataset that includes information about the matching minutiae according to an expert. We aim with our results to provide a baseline for new research in latent palmprint identification feature representations, allowing for a fair comparison of newly developed representations in the future, which would enhance the whole latent palmprint identification methods. For this purpose, we also publicly provide our dataset, methodology implementation, and the feature representations implementation tested in our experiments. (C) 2019 The Authors.

AB Recent advances in machine learning have been able to make improvements over the state-of-the-art regarding semantic similarity measurement techniques. In fact, we have all seen how classical techniques have given way to promising neural techniques. Nonetheless, these new techniques have a weak point: they are hardly interpretable. For this reason, we have oriented our research towards the design of strategies being able to be accurate enough but without sacrificing their interpretability. As a result, we have obtained a strategy for the automatic design of semantic similarity controllers based on fuzzy logics, which are automatically identified using genetic algorithms (GAs). After an exhaustive evaluation using a number of well-known benchmark datasets, we can conclude that our strategy fulfills both expectations: it is able of achieving reasonably good results, and at the same time, it can offer high degrees of interpretability.

AB Several problems in signal processing are addressed by expert systems which take into account a set of priors on the sought signals and systems. For instance, blind source separation is often tackled by means of a mono-objective formulation which relies on a separation criterion associated with a given property of the sought signals (sources). However, in many practical situations, there are more than one property to be exploited and, as a consequence, a set of separation criteria may be used to recover the original signals. In this context, this paper addresses the separation problem by means of an approach based on multi-objective optimization. Differently from the existing methods, which provide only one estimate for the original signals, our proposal leads to a set of solutions that can be utilized by the system user to take his/her decision. Results obtained through numerical experiments over a set of biomedical signals highlight the viability of the proposed approach, which provides estimations closer to the mean squared error solutions compared to the ones achieved via a mono-objective formulation. Moreover, since our proposal is quite general, this work also contributes to encourage future researches to develop expert systems that exploit the multi-objective formulation in different source separation problems.

AB One insufficiently grounded criticism made against Latent Semantic Analysis is that it is impossible to semantically interpret its dimensions. This is not true, as several studies have transformed the latent semantic space to interpret them, by means of some methods. One of them is the Inbuilt-Rubric method. Rather than grouping concepts around dimensions, as in Exploratory Factor Analysis based rotation methods, the Inbuilt-Rubric is a method that perform an "a priori" imposition of concepts onto the latent semantic space. It uses a confirmatory strategy. This study seeks to propose solutions for two limitations found in the current Inbuilt-Rubric methodology: one solution is inspired by Bifactor Models and the management of common variance of the concepts involved; and the other one is based in randomizing the sequence to perform the process. Both methods outperform the current Inbuilt-Rubric version in relevant content detection. The reported improvements can be incorporated into expert systems that use Latent Semantic Analysis and Inbuilt-Rubric in relevant content detection or text classification tasks.

DE Image splicing detection; Stationary wavelet transform; Markov model;
   Textural features; Image forgery detection
AB Nowadays, image forgery is a widespread problem in our lives. Image splicing is one method of forging images, and it has become a common tool for malicious users to modify images. Human eyes cannot perceive forgery operations on forged images; therefore, designing an expert system for detecting image authenticity has become a necessity. The splicing method causes some distortions that can be used to detect forgery on a tampered image. In this work, an expert system is designed that uses the statistical and textural properties of an image in a hybrid manner to detect forgery. The method extracts properties (statistical and textural) from high-level sub-bands of stationary wavelet transform (SWT) domain. SWT is used to obtain image's details in a multi scale manner in frequency domain. The method extracts statistical features from three sub-bands via Markov model, which generates transition probability matrices and then obtains Haralic's textural features based on gray level co-occurrence matrices. Features from each sub-bands are concatenated to form final feature vector. This expert system is the first in the literature to be designed using textural and statistical features together. Finally, the designed expert system classifies images as authentic or forged using SVM. The system's performance was evaluated using three publicly available image databases and tested for different attack types. The experimental results show that using statistical and textural features in a hybrid manner improves detection accuracy when compared to similar works in the literature. The main impact of the proposed system is its high accuracy and robust detection of different attack types. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Modern time-domain astronomy is capable of collecting a staggeringly large amount of data on millions of objects in real time. Therefore, the production of methods and systems for the automated classification of time-domain astronomical objects is of great importance. The Liverpool Telescope has a number of wide-field image gathering instruments mounted upon its structure, the Small Telescopes Installed at the Liverpool Telescope. These instruments have been in operation since March 2009 gathering data of large areas of sky around the current field of view of the main telescope generating a large dataset containing millions of light sources. The instruments are inexpensive to run as they do not require a separate telescope to operate but this style of surveying the sky introduces structured artifacts into our data due to the variable cadence at which sky fields are resampled. These artifacts can make light sources appear variable and must be addressed in any processing method.
   The data from large sky surveys can lead to the discovery of interesting new variable objects. Efficient software and analysis tools are required to rapidly determine which potentially variable objects are worthy of further telescope time. Machine learning offers a solution to the quick detection of variability by characterising the detected signals relative to previously seen exemplars. In this paper, we introduce a processing system designed for use with the Liverpool Telescope identifying potentially interesting objects through the application of a novel representation learning approach to data collected automatically from the wide-field instruments. Our method automatically produces a set of classification features by applying Principal Component Analysis on set of variable light curves using a piecewise polynomial fitted via a genetic algorithm applied to the epoch-folded data. The epoch-folding requires the selection of a candidate period for variable light curves identified using a genetic algorithm period estimation method specifically developed for this dataset A Random Forest classifier is then used to classify the learned features to determine if a light curve is generated by an object of interest. This system allows for the telescope to automatically identify new targets through passive observations which do not affect dayto-day operations as the unique artifacts resulting from such a survey method are incorporated into the methods.
   We demonstrate the power of this feature extraction method compared to feature engineering performed by previous studies by training classification models on 859 light curves of 12 known variable star classes from our dataset. We show that our new features produce a model with a superior mean cross-validation F1 score of 0.4729 with a standard deviation of 0.0931 compared with the engineered features at 0.3902 with a standard deviation of 0.0619. We show that the features extracted from the representation learning are given relatively high importance in the final classification model. Additionally, we compare engineered features computed on the interpolated polynomial fits and show that they produce more reliable distributions than those fit to the raw light curve when the period estimation is correct.

ID TEXT CLASSIFICATION; CLASSIFIERS; ALGORITHM
AB This paper presents a new semantic kernel for classification of high-dimensional data in the framework of Support Vector Machines (SVM). SVMs have gained widespread application due to their relatively higher accuracy. The efficacy of SVMs, however, depends upon the separation of the data itself as well as the kernel function. Text data, for instance, is difficult to classify due to synonymy and polysemy in its contents, having multi-topical instances that can result in mislabeling, and being highly sparse in the bag-of-words representation. While the soft margin parameter and kernel tricks are used in SVM to deal with outliers and non-linearly separable data, using data statistics and correlation has not been fully explored in the literature. This paper explore the use co-similarity (i.e., soft co-clustering) to find latent relationships between documents motivated by the success of co-clustering and subspace clustering methods. It has been shown that the use of weighted higher-order paths between instances in the data can be a good measure of similarity values which can then be used for both classification and to correct mislabeled (or outlier) data in the training set. The proposed kernel is generic in nature and suitable for sparse, dyadic data where direct co-occurrences are not necessary common as in the case of textual data, link-analysis in social media networks, co-authorship, etc. It also studies the impact of noise in the training data and provides a technique to re-label such instances. It is also observed that re-labelling of selected training data reduces the adverse effect of outliers or label noise and can greatly improve the classification of the test data. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce a supervised co-similarity based kernel function and also provide mathematical formulation to show that it is a valid Mercer's kernel. Our experiments show that the proposed framework outperforms current and state-of-the-art methods in terms of classification accuracy and is more resilient to label noise. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

ID IMPUTATION
AB Low quality of business process event logs, as determined by anomalous and missing values, is often unavoidable in practical contexts. The output of process analysis that uses event logs with missing and anomalous values is also likely to be of low quality, thus decreasing the quality of any decisions based on it While previous work has focused on reconstructing missing events in an event log or removing anomalous traces, in this paper we focus on detecting anomalous values and reconstructing missing values at the level of attributes in event logs. We propose methods based on autoencoders, which are a class of neural networks that can reconstruct their own input and are particularly suitable to learn a model of the complex relationships among attribute values in an event log. These methods do not rely on any a-priori knowledge about the business process that generated an event log and are evaluated using real world and artificially-generated event logs. The paper also discusses a qualitative analysis of the impact of event log cleaning and reconstruction on the output of process discovery. The proposed approach shows remarkable performance regarding activity labels and timestamps in artificial event logs. The performance in the case of real world event logs, in particular timestamp anomaly detection, is lower, which may be due to high variability of attribute values in the chosen event logs. Process models discovered from reconstructed event logs are characterised by lower variability of allowed behaviour and, therefore, are more usable in practice. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This article presents a multi-agent framework for optimization using metaheuristics, called AMAM. In this proposal, each agent acts independently in the search space of a combinatorial optimization problem. Agents share information and collaborate with each other through the environment. The goal is to enable the agent to modify their actions based on experiences gained in interacting with the other agents and the environment using the concepts of Reinforcement Learning. For better introduction and validation of the AMAM framework, this article uses the instantiation of the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW) and the Unrelated Parallel Machine Scheduling Problem with Sequence-Dependent Setup Times (UPMSP-ST), i.e., two classic combinatorial optimization problems. The main objective of the experiments is to evaluate the performance of the proposed adaptive agents. The experiments confirm that the ability to learn attributed to the agent directly influences the quality of solutions, both from the individual point of view and from the point of view of teamwork. In this way, the framework presented here is a step forward in relation to the other frameworks of the literature regarding to the adaptation to the particular aspects of the problems. Additionally, the cooperation between agents and their ability to influence the quality of the solutions of the agents involved in the search of the solution is confirmed. The results also strengthen the issue of the scalability of the framework, since, with the addition of new agents, there is an improvement of the solutions obtained. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

ID DISCOVERY
AB Sequential pattern mining has been the focus of many works, but still faces a tough challenge in the mining of large databases for both efficiency and apprehensibility of its resulting set. To overcome these issues, the most promising direction taken by the literature relies on the use of constraints, including the well-known closedness constraint. However, such a mining is not resistant to noise in data, a characteristic of most real-world data. The main research question raised in this paper is thus: how to efficiently mine an apprehensible set of sequential patterns from noisy data?
   In order to address this research question, we introduce 1) two original constraints designed for the mining of noisy data: the robustness and the extended-closedness constraints, 2) a generic pattern mining algorithm, C3Ro, designed to mine a wide range of sequential patterns, going from closed or maximal contiguous sequential patterns to closed or maximal regular sequential patterns. C3Ro is dedicated to practitioners and is able to manage their multiple constraints. C3Ro also is the first sequential pattern mining algorithm to be as generic and parameterizable. Extensive experiments have been conducted and reveal the high efficiency of C3Ro, especially in large datasets, over well-known algorithms from the literature. Additional experiments have been conducted on a real-world job offers noisy dataset, with the goal to mine activities. This experiment offers a more thorough insight into C3Ro algorithm: job market experts confirm that the constraints we introduced actually have a significant positive impact on the apprehensibility of the set of mined activities.

AB The main purpose of video-based event recognition is to interpret activities or behaviors within video sequences, in order to detect and isolate specific events, which have to be readily recognized and prompted to the people responsible for their monitoring. In this paper, we present a knowledge representation framework and a system for automatic video surveillance, which analyzes record scenes in order to detect the occurrence of specific events defined as targets. The framework, named Elements and Descriptors of Context and Action Representations (EDCAR), enables the representation of relevant elements, general descriptors of the context, and actions that have to be captured, including the definition of action compositions and sequences, in order to monitor and recognize abnormal situations. EDCAR and the associated system also support video summarization of relevant scenes, providing an inference engine to handle complex queries. They have been used experimentally on several video surveillance scenarios, which enabled us to prove their effectiveness with respect to similar solutions described in the literature.

AB A latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model is a machine learning technique to identify latent topics from text corpora within a Bayesian hierarchical framework. Current popular inferential methods to fit the LDA model are based on variational Bayesian inference, collapsed Gibbs sampling, or a combination of these. Because these methods assume a unimodal distribution over topics, however, they can suffer from large bias when text corpora consist of various clusters with different topic distributions. This paper proposes an inferential LDA method to efficiently obtain unbiased estimates under flexible modeling for heterogeneous text corpora with the method of partial collapse and the Dirichlet process mixtures. The method is illustrated using a simulation study and an application to a corpus of 1300 documents from neural information processing systems (NIPS) conference articles during the period of 2000-2002 and British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) news articles during the period of 2004-2005.

AB Developing an automatic license plate recognition system that can cope with multiple factors is challenging and interesting in the current scenario. In this paper, we introduce a new concept called partial character reconstruction to segment characters of license plates to enhance the performance of license plate recognition systems. Partial character reconstruction is proposed based on the characteristics of stroke width in the Laplacian and gradient domain in a novel way. This results in character components with incomplete shapes. The angular information of character components determined by PCA and the major axis are then studied by considering regular spacing between characters and aspect ratios of character components in a new way for segmenting characters. Next, the same stroke width properties are used for reconstructing the complete shape of each character in the gray domain rather than in the gradient domain, which helps in improving the recognition rate. Experimental results on benchmark license plate databases, namely, MIMOS, Medialab, UCSD data, Uninsbria data Challenged data, as well as video databases, namely, ICDAR 2015, YVT video, and natural scene data, namely, ICDAR 2013, ICDAR 2015, SVT, MSRA, show that the proposed technique is effective and useful.

AB This paper presents a fuzzy expert system for prioritization of heterogeneous customers with different needs. In this way, it is possible to improve the average waiting cost of a queuing system and enhance customer satisfaction as the basic component of organizations. Each customer has his own specific characteristics and demands and expects the system to understand his value and provide the best service. In this study, a two-stage Mamdani fuzzy inference system (FIS) was applied as a decision-making approach to prioritize customers based on Service Duration, Service Value, Customer Loyalty, Maximum Toleration, and Waiting Time. For this purpose, an expert system was developed that can be applied in various fields perfectly. To evaluate and analyze the performance of Fuzzy Prioritization System (FPS), the proposed model is compared with the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) and the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) methods as common approaches for prioritizing customers. The results of numerical experiments revealed the efficiency of the proposed system compared to these two methods. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE Video summarization; Subjective evaluation; Evaluation metric
ID SHOT-BOUNDARY DETECTION; RETRIEVAL
AB Hours of video are uploaded to streaming platforms every minute, with recommender systems suggesting popular and relevant videos that can help users save time in the searching process. Recommender systems regularly require video summarization as an expert system to automatically identify suitable video entities and events. Since there is no well-established methodology to evaluate the relevance of summarized videos, some studies have made use of user annotations to gather evidence about the effectiveness of summarization methods. Aimed at modelling the user's perceptions, which ultimately form the basis for testing video summarization systems, this paper seeks to propose: (i) A guideline to collect unrestricted user annotations, (ii) a novel metric called compression level of user annotation (CLUSA) to gauge the performance of video summarization methods, and (iii) a study on the quality of annotated video summaries collected from different assessment scales. These contributions lead to benchmarking video summarization methods with no constraints, even if user annotations are collected from different assessment scales for each method. Our experiments showed that CLUSA is less susceptible to unbalanced compression data sets in comparison to other metrics, hence achieving higher reliability estimates. CLUSA also allows to compare results from different video summarizing approaches. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This article presents a system for predicting a human's risk of contracting infectious diseases based on their personal attributes and environments (region, specific location features and climate contexts). This system is also intended to help human experts in the domain (i.e. epidemiologists) to represent their knowledge and ease their jobs related to personalized infectious disease risk prediction. The system consists of a knowledge representation to encode epidemiological knowledge about infectious disease risk, and an algorithm that auto-converts the encoded knowledge into a model that predicts the risk as a probability. The knowledge representation, Infectious Disease Risk (IDR), consists of an ontology and rules to represent the knowledge structure and its quantification in a way that allows auto-generation to a prediction model, Bayesian Network (BN). The algorithm, BN-Builder, converts the IDR knowledge-base to an infectious disease risk BN, including populating the basis of predictive reasoning from the IDR rules. A user interface facilitates encoding of epidemiological knowledge into the IDR knowledge-base. The system's output, personalized infectious disease risk prediction, is validated for three disease-country contexts: Dengue Fever and Tuberculosis in Indonesia, and Cholera in India. The personalized infectious disease risks are reliable (p values > 0.05) for each population parameter. The personalized infectious disease risk probability can be reliably predicted using this system. Inclusion of more granularity on contexts in this domain will be considered in further development of this system. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a new method to remove baseline drift and noise by using a differential electrooculography (EOG) signal based on a fixation curve (DOSbFC) and a new electrode positioning scheme based on eyeglasses for user convenience. In addition, a desktop application and mobile applications to control the human-computer interface were implemented. Finally, we created experimental EOG eyeglasses and a new detection protocol using the proposed method for long-term step-by-step detection of eye movements and user comfort. The proposed DOSbFC calculates the difference values of accumulated EOG signals between the initial eye movement and fixation time. It allows long-term detection of eye movements with high accuracy and only requires a single calibration. The vertical and ground electrodes of the standard electrode positioning scheme caused discomfort of subjects; the proposed electrode positioning scheme solves these problems and enables the use of existing eyeglasses without design modification. The experimental results demonstrated that the average accuracy of the long-term eye movement detection was 94%, whereas those of the band pass filter and wavelet transform were 61% and 64%, respectively. This was because baseline drift and noise were removed by averaging the signal variations. Further experimental results demonstrated that the average information transfer rate of the proposed method was 6.0, whereas those of the band pass filter and wavelet transform were 1.1 and 0.9, respectively.

AB Identifying customers' expectations for recovery service plays an important role in firms' service recovery. We proposed a customer expectation detection method, which includes data acquisition, expectation classification, experimental preparation and expectation detection, to identify individual service recovery expectations from her/his complaints. Before describing the method, to ensure detection accuracy, we first presented a new expectation classification. In the method, we acquired data from a website called automobile complaint network and sorted the expectations into new categories. We extracted the features of complaints using Word2vec and examined the validity of classifiers by k-fold cross validation. Meanwhile, we also examined the feature dimensions and n-gram approaches, finding that 100-dimension features obtained using 1-gram approach can be used as the independent variables in our method. Then, using the new expectation classifications as dependent variables, we programmed different machine learning classifiers and selected the suitable classifier for each type of expectation detection. Finally, the advantage of new classification was validated and Word2vec, GloVe and TF-IDF had been compared. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Model selection to improve multiple imputation for handling high rate

ID CHAINED EQUATIONS
AB In the current era of "information everywhere", extracting knowledge from a great amount of data is increasingly acknowledged as a promising channel for providing relevant insights to decision makers. One key issue encountered may be the poor quality of the raw data, particularly due to the high missingness, that may affect the quality and the relevance of the results' interpretation. Automating the exploration of the underlying data with powerful methods, allowing to handle missingness and then perform a learning process to discover relevant knowledge, can then be considered as a successful strategy for systems' monitoring. Within the context of water quality analysis, the aim of the present study is to propose a robust method for selecting the best algorithm to combine with MICE (Multivariate Imputations by Chained Equations) in order to handle multiple relationships between a high amount of features of interest (more than 200) concerned with a high rate of missingness (more than 80%). The main contribution is to improve MICE, taking advantage of the ability of Machine Learning algorithms to address complex relationships among a large number of parameters. The competing methods that are implemented are Random Forest (RF), Boosted Regression Trees (BRT), K- Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Regression (SVR). The obtained results show that the hybridization of MICE with SVR, KNN, RF and BRT performs better than the original MICE taken alone. Furthermore, MICE-SVR gives a good trade-off in terms of performance and computing time. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Bayesian network (BN) has been widely used in modeling expert knowledge and reasoning in many application domains, due to its power of representing probabilistic knowledge over a set of interacting variables under significant uncertain. However, the actual construction of a Bayesian network model for a domain remains to be a challenging task since it involves learning the causal structure and the conditional probability table of BN variables from experts, and/or observational data. In this paper, we explore the unique challenge of applying Bayesian network to model how public safety officials represent and reason about threats of evolving mass protest. Anticipating threats of mass protests is crucial for choosing proper intervention strategies, but it is also inherently difficult because a large number of interacting factors contribute to the dynamics of protests with high uncertainty and contingency. In constructing the BN model for this complex domain, we found that traditional methods of discovering BN structure either from data or experts are inadequate, due to the scarcity of data and the highly stochastic nature of mass protest events. Instead, we proposed a hybrid approach (called "ISM-K2") which enhances the BN structure learning methods (K2 algorithm) by expert knowledge elicited using the ISM (interpretive structural model) method. We show that the BN model constructed using ISM-K2 approach is superior than three other base-line models (the logistic regression model, the BN constructed only by expert knowledge from ISM, and the BN constructed only by data learning). Finally, we show the potential of using our BN threat assessment model for supporting practical policing decisions. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The effects of hazelnut supplemented diet on the reproductive system of young and old male rats were investigated. Young male rats were grouped into young control group (YCG) and young hazelnut group (YHG). Old male rats were grouped into old control group (OCG), old hazelnut group (OHG), and old vitamin E group (OEG). While YCG and OCG were given rat feed, YHG and OHG were given rat feed supplemented with hazelnut (3 g/kg body weight). OEG was subjected to rat feed and administered vitamin E (50 mg/kg body weight). When YCG and OCG were compared, aging increased histopathological damage and decreased sperm quality. Hazelnut supplemented diet improved histopathological variables, sperm quality, seminal plasma and plasma oxidative stress, seminal plasma vitamin E, and plasma testosterone levels in both groups. The present work suggests that hazelnut supplemented diet significantly improves testicular antioxidant function and semen quality in old male rats.

AB Hot water is an easily implementable process for polyphenols extraction. To evaluate the effect of this process on apple pomace, the overall polyphenolic composition was assessed before and after hot water extraction, followed by extractions with aqueous/organic solutions. As determined by UHPLC-DAD, flavan-3-ols were the main apple native polyphenols. Their amount decreased 50% after hot water extraction, while the other classes remained unchanged. Dihydrochalcones and hydroxycinnamic acid oxidation products, were also observed, alongside with non-extractable oxidised procyanidins that represented more than 4-fold the amount of native apple polyphenols in the pomace. Microwave superheated-water extraction of the insoluble cell wall material in water/acetone solutions and the high amounts of polyphenols that were insoluble in water/ethanol solutions suggested that oxidised procyanidins could be covalently linked to polysaccharides. These complexes represented up to 40% of the available polyphenols from apple pomace, potentially relevant for agro-food waste valuation.

AB A novel aptasensor, based on a perylene probe (PAPDI; N,N'-bis(propylenetrimethylammonium)-3,4,9,10-perylenediimide), was developed for the detection of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) in maize samples. AuNPs/DNA composites were synthesized and integrated with aptamers-modified magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) via DNA hybridization. For AFB1 determination, AuNPs/DNA composites were released from MNPs through specific binding of AFB1 with the aptamer and used for assembly of the PAPDI probe. To enhance the method sensitivity, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-catalyzed DNA polymerization was performed to elongate DNA on AuNPs/ DNA composites. As a result, more PAPDI probes were assembled on the AuNPs/DNA composites. Through a multiple signal amplification strategy, the proposed method exhibited high sensitivity towards AFB1, with a detection limit of 0.01 nM (3.1 pg/mL). In summary, the proposed method has great potential to be a universal strategy for monitoring AFB1 in food samples.

AB Compounds that contribute to the somatosensory flavor profile of bovine fluid milk products were investigated. Sensory descriptive analysis defined five main attributes that consisted of "mouthcoating, astringent/drying, fatty texture, dairy mouthfeel, and tingling/irritation" sensations. Utilizing mull-dimensional LC sensory guided fractionation, compounds with these attributes were selected, purified and subsequently identified by LC/MS as orotic acid, pantothenic acid, hippuric acid, and p-cresol sulfate. Quantitative analysis of the four compounds across skim milk, low fat milk and whole milk indicated the concentrations were not significantly different; however, they were significantly lower in cream. Sensory recombination milk model analysis of each compound at endogenous concentrations of fluid milk indicated all compounds were sensory active. Furthermore, using a 2-AFC sensory test, skim milk spiked at two-fold higher concentrations of the 4 compounds had a significantly "creamier, fuller body" when compared with skim milk itself (alpha = 0.01).

The results demonstrate relatively narrow spans of variabilities observed for Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio and Sr concentrations in authentic Bordeaux wines, which can be used with reasonable certainty as specific parameters for identifying regional wineries. For comparison, a set of imitated Bordeaux wines was studied for Sr isotopic and elemental compositions. A significant excess of both parameters in suspicious wines were found in reference to authentic values. Such natural and anthropogenically induced variations offer an enhanced discriminating potential of Sr. The unique Sr binary signature may detect imitated wines and trace genuine products from different regional wineries. The obtained results shown a promising perspective for wine authenticity control by means of Sr isotopic and elemental composition.

AB LC-MS/MS is the mainstream technique for the analysis of naturally occurring compounds in food. Because of the complex chemical composition of food, the most challenging validation parameters are those related to the matrix - linearity (calibration) and trueness. The influence of the interfering compounds on the analytical results is reflected in the extraction efficiency and matrix effect. These effects must be compensated for, if they cannot be removed or reduced by optimizing the extraction and the LC-MS/MS method. The calibration strategy is selected on the basis of the analytical conditions - complexity of matrix, and chemical structure and number of analytes. It is advisable to estimate trueness - both extraction efficacy and matrix effect during the preliminary experiments in order to select the right type of calibration. Finally, it is essential to describe the validation procedure in detail and refer to the used guidelines in order to provide a reproducible method.

AB Perilla oil is abundant in alpha-linolenic acid, which is metabolized to long-chain n-3 fatty acids. This study aimed to determine thermal stability and bioavailability of perilla oil that was powdered by inclusion complexation with gamma-cyclodextrin. Fatty acid analysis revealed that the relative abundance of alpha-linolenic and linoleic acids in the complexes was not affected by heating at 40 degrees C for six days but decreased after heating at 60 degrees C for three days. No adverse events occurred in rats fed with an experimental diet containing the complexes for two weeks. Plasma alpha-linolenic and eicosapentaenoic acids in rats fed with diets containing complexes and liquid perilla oil were equally high, indicating the preserved bioavailability of perilla oil in the complexes. Plasma arachidonic acid decreased only in rats fed with a diet containing the complexes. Results suggest that the complexes have potential as a useful source of a-linolenic acid to increase plasma n-3 fatty acids.

AB Mycotoxins are toxic compounds that can be present in feed, food and beverages. In this work, 25 magnetic nanostructured materials were developed to remove the main types of mycotoxins from liquid food matrices. The efficiency for binding mycotoxins from contaminated aqueous solutions was studied. Nanocomposites (diameters lower to 15 mu m) composed of mixtures of activated carbon, bentonite and aluminium oxide were able to eliminate up to 87% of mycotoxins with an adsorption efficiency of 450 mu g/g. On the other hand, spheres with sizes below 3 mm and composed by biopolymers and activated carbon or graphene oxide removed up to 70% of mycotoxins (adsorption of 598 ng/g). These particles were tested for beer detoxification, and spheres composed of alginate and activated carbon or pectin maintain the ability to eliminate toxins from this beverage. Hence, this technology could be a useful tool for the food industry.

AB Cases of honey poisoning have been reported widely, meaning there is a need for methods that detect "mad honey" or honey contaminated with plant-derived toxins to protect human health. In this study, we compared whole flower extracts and honey from Tripterygium wilfordii Hook. f. (TwHf) and Macleaya cordata (Willd) R. Br (McRB) using QuEChERS (quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe) and ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC/Q-TOF-MS). The results revealed several compounds common to whole flowers and honey samples. Triptolide and protopine were selected as potential markers for identifying "mad honeys" from these plants. The developed method can easily detect different honey varieties that were spiked with 5% TwHf and McRB honey samples. Additionally, 90 commercial honey samples were analyzed and determined as free from contamination. The method described in this report could be useful for studies on honey from other poisonous nectar and pollen plants.

ID MULTIPLEX QUANTIFICATION
AB The increased use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) is accompanied by increased complexity of the matrices that contain GMOs. The most common DNA-based approach for GMO detection and quantification is real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). However, as qPCR is sensitive to inhibitors and relies on standard curves for quantification, it has limited application in GMO quantification for complex matrices. To overcome this hurdle in DNA quantification, we present droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) assays that were designed to target 'Roundup Ready' soybean and the soybean reference gene. Three ddPCR assays were transferred from qPCR to QX100/QX200 ddPCR platforms and characterised. Together, the fitness-for-purpose study on four reallife samples and the use of a chamber-based PCR system, showed that dPCR has great potential to improve such measurements in GMO testing and monitoring of food authenticity.

AB Millet bran was fermented with Bacillus natto and the changes of structural, physicochemical and functional properties of its dietary fiber were investigated. Results showed that B. natto fermentation enhanced soluble DF content from 2.3% to 13.2%, and soluble DF/insoluble DF ratio from 3.1% to 19.9%. SEM and FTIR assay indicated that fermentation led to the degradation of cellulose and hemicellulose, thereby forming more porous and loose structure and polysaccharides. The binding capacities such as water and oil holding capacity, swelling capacity as well as cholesterol, bile salts, nitrite ion and glucose adsorption capacity were improved, while cation exchange capacity was not significantly changed. The total phenolic content and DPPH free radical scavenging capacity increased significantly. Overall, fermentation of millet bran by B. natto improved the structural and functional properties of its DF, which could be applied as a functional ingredient in food products.

The results indicated that with an addition of a small amount of QF (5%) would not affect the baking performance of WB, while higher amounts of QF (10% and 15%) resulted in smaller specific volume, increased hardness and coarse porosity, since QF changed gluten secondary structure and disrupted gluten network. However, sensory evaluation showed that the flavor of WB enhanced significantly with increasing QF addition. More importantly, WB containing QF exhibited improved antioxidant activity and reduced in vitro digestibility with lower estimated glycemic index (eGI) and higher content of slowly digestible starch (SDS) and resistant starch (RS). Our findings indicate that QF-fortified bread is promising to be developed as a functional food with relatively lower eGI and more effective antioxidant properties.

DE Rice vinasse; Starch digestibility; Fermentation; Structure
ID PHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES; DIGESTION
AB In consideration of health benefits, more digestible vinasses were investigated, which are associated with the use of different raw cereals and fermented leavens. In an in vitro digestibility test, milled long-grain glutinous rice vinasse with Taibai rice leaven showed a slow glucose-controlled release potential, which contained 37.08% slowly digestible starch, after complete vinasse consumption. The crystalline structure, thermal properties and morphology of vinasse starches were analysed. The relatively long amylopectin chains, which originated from the starch structure present in raw rice and the higher glucoamylase activity of the fermented leaven, partly explained the slower digestion of vinasse. By the optimization of the type of fermented leaven used and the starch structure of the raw rice in fermentation, the rate of vinasse starch digestion could be controlled, resulting in improved nutritional value. The results of this study are important for designing healthy vinasse products by controlling starch structures and digestion rates.

AB Magnetic solid-phase extraction (MSPE), using a new reversed-phase/weak anion exchange mix-mode mesoporous magnetic SiO2 adsorbent, was assessed as an approach for reducing matrix effects in the analysis of six lipophilic marine biotoxins in shellfish using ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). The adsorbent showed greater adsorption capacity and selectivity for the analytes and, thus, the MSPE microspheres reduced the matrix effects significantly in the subsequent analysis. In the UPLC-MS/MS analysis, precursor and product ions of the analytes were monitored quantitatively and qualitatively using multiple reaction monitoring and product ion confirmation modes. The proposed method exhibited a linear correlation of 0.9980-0.9991 in the working range for azaspiracids (2.0-200.0 ng/mL) and okadaic acid and its derivatives dinophysistoxins (4.0-200.0 ng/mL) with satisfactory recoveries (82.8-118.6%, RSD < 12%), lower LODs (0.4-1.0 mu g/kg) and LOQs (1.0-4.0 mu g/kg) than existing methods. In addition, consumption of the adsorbent was reduced, and the MSPE operation is simple and rapid relative to alternatives. These results suggest the proposed method has potential for use in the analysis of lipophilic marine biotoxins in shellfish samples.

AB The feasibility of producing durum wheat pasta enriched with a lipophilic phytocomplex, extracted using supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2), from ripe pumpkin, as free oil or as ready-to-mix oil/alpha-cyclodextrins (alpha-CDs) powder, was explored. Four types of pasta were prepared: (i) control spaghetti (S-CTRL); (ii) spaghetti supplemented with alpha-CDs (S-alpha-CD); (iii) spaghetti supplemented with pumpkin oil (S-Oil) and (iv) spaghetti supplemented with the pumpkin oil/alpha-CD powder (S-Oil/alpha-CD). The chemical, antioxidant, textural and sensory attributes of the different pasta were evaluated and compared. S-Oil and S-Oil/alpha-CD spaghetti were significantly enriched with phytosterols, squalene, carotenoids, tocochromanols and unsaturated fatty acids. Spaghetti containing alpha-CDs were slightly improved in terms of fiber content. Oil chlatration increased the stability of some bioactives during pasta production and ameliorated poor textural and sensory characteristics of the cooked spaghetti compared with S-Oil sample. S-Oil/alpha-CD spaghetti might be accepted by customers, if the potential health benefits were also explained.

AB We previously reported a humidity-mediated method to effectively remove methanol from the crystal lattice of 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate sodium (cAMPNa) methanol trihydrate, converting it to the pentahydrate without changing its inherent orthorhombic packing mode, and preserving its stability. In this paper, we expand this approach to the removal of residual solvents from L-lysine L-glutamate salt and inosine-5'-monophosphate, and contrast the humidity-mediated method with a solvent-mediated method and a conventional drying method. The packing density of the products obtained from the humidity-mediated method were similar to 60% higher than those of the products obtained from the solvent-mediated method, and their stability is similar to 5-10% higher than those obtained from the solvent-mediated and traditional drying methods. Furthermore, the humidity-mediated method can remove residual methanol more completely. Therefore, the humidity-mediated method can be regarded as a simple and effective route to eliminate residual solvent from crystal lattice for some crystal products, especially residual methanol.

AB Health benefits are associated with polyunsaturated fatty acids, but their sensitivity to oxidation may generate toxic oxidation species. The objective of this study was to compare the effect of milk proteins (casein, whey protein) and surfactants (Citrem, Tween 20) on the in vitro digestion and oxidation of linseed oil emulsions. The emulsion produced with Tween 20 resisted coalescence in the gastric phase and showed the highest concentrations of free fatty acids and reactive carbonyl compounds in the intestinal digestion phase. The Citrem-stabilized emulsion showed extensive coalescence in the gastric environment, which reduced lipolysis and the formation of advanced oxidation species. The protein-stabilized emulsions showed aggregation with some coalescence in the gastric phase, and casein provided better protection than whey protein against oxidation. This study suggests that the mechanism of emulsion destabilization in the gastric environment and the type of protein can modulate lipolysis and oxidation during in vitro digestion.

AB A method was developed with ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for the qualitative and semi-quantitative analysis of anthocyanins and anthocyanin-derived adducts in red wine. The method utilized in-source collision induced dissociation in conjunction with multiple reaction monitoring to achieve group-specific detection of the targeted compound groups. The method detected quantification marker ions instead of intact molecules and, as a result, 2D chromatographic fingerprints were produced. Altogether we could detect 18 groups of wine polyphenols, including up to 50 individual monomeric pigments together with fingerprints of three different types oligomeric proanthocyanidin-malvidin adducts. Importantly, the method was able to separate small, medium-sized and large oligomeric adducts. The quantitative and qualitative function of the method was tested with 10 model wines. Ultimately, we were able to obtain a comprehensive picture of the main pigment composition of any model wine with only a single UPLC-MS/MS analysis.

AB Wheat noodles with added native or denatured pea-protein isolate were characterised for their starch-protein interaction, degree of starch gelatinisation, starch digestibility, textural and sensory properties using light microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), in vitro digestion, textural profile analysis (TPA) and descriptive analysis respectively. It was hypothesised that denatured proteins with an unfolded structure, would have greater interaction with starch, thereby reducing the extent of gelatinisation and subsequent glucose release compared to native proteins. Results showed that the addition of denatured pea protein to a wheat noodle matrix produced a reduction in in vitro glucose release, which was supported by a lower degree of gelatinisation and greater binding of protein to the starch matrix visually. Addition of native protein to the noodles had less impact on degree of gelatinisation and glucose release. Addition of both proteins had a negligible effect on product texture and sensory perceptual properties.

AB An effective method has been developed for the simultaneous determination of four bisphenols (bisphenol A, S, F and B) in various foodstuffs. The contaminants were extracted by QuEChERS-based strategy and subjected to ion-exchange solid-phase extraction for further clean-up. The critical variables were screened by Plackett-Burman design and then optimized by central composite design. Under the optimized conditions, satisfactory accuracy (recoveries 76%-116%) and precision (RSDs < 12%) were achieved. The established method was then used to assess the contamination status of 379 real samples. Bisphenol A was demonstrated to be the predominant bisphenol with highest incidence (79.7%) and average concentration (14.3 mu g/kg). The positive rates (mean concentration) of bisphenol S, F and B were 37.7% (1.6 mu g/kg), 26.9% (1.4 mu g/kg) and 0.0% (not detected), respectively. Finally, the daily dietary intakes of Sigma(4) bisphenolsfor adult residents were estimated (55.9-76.1 ng/kg bw/day) according to the contamination concentrations and the daily recommended intakes.

AB Polylactic acid (PLA) is one of the most commonly used biopolymers for manufacturing food packaging; its control is very important to ensure consumers' health. In this work, a blend of PLA and polyester was studied and its volatile composition in the polymer and in the migration to food simulants was determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and atmospheric pressure gas chromatography-quadrupole-time of flight mass spectrometry (APGC-QTOF). The results showed that both techniques provided complementary information, to give complete information on the biopolymer's composition. Some compounds such as lactide or cyclopentanone were detected only by GC-MS while others, such as the cyclic dimer [AA-BD](2) (AA:adipic acid, BD:butanediol), were detected only by APGC-MS. In migration, lactide, AA-BD and [AA-BD](2) were identified in ethanol 95%. A GC-olfactometry study was also carried out. Some compounds showed sensory impact on the polymer odor but not in migration.

AB The effects of cooling rate (CR) on retrograded nucleation of rice starch-aromatic molecule complexes were evaluated. Six aromatic molecules (hexanal, 1-octen-3-ol, gamma-decalactone, guaiacol, 2, 3-butanedione, and 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline) were chosen to represent the typical aromas in cooked rice. Differential scanning calorimetry results showed that increased CR from 0.34 to 3.04 degrees C/min led to reduced enthalpy change (AH) (in 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline from 2.08 to 1.40 J/g), reduced Tp (in 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline 100.91 to 98.29 degrees C whereas in 2,3-butanedione it remained almost constant) and increased Tc-To (but fluctuating in gamma-decalactone) (p < 0.05). These results indicate that the nucleation forming at higher CR were more thermally unstable, less perfect, and more heterogeneous. X-ray diffraction analysis further indicated that nucleation forming at high CR was looser and with lower relative crystallinity (in 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline decreased from 2.18% to 1.00%) (p < 0.05). These results may aid the development of procedures for more effective preservation of aromatic molecules in cooked rice.

AB The grain formation stage is a critical stage that affects grain starch quality and frequently overlaps the rainy season in southern China for waxy maize production. Two waxy maize varieties were grown under control and waterlogging conditions during grain formation (1-15 days after pollination) to probe the effects of over-saturated soil moisture on starch structural and functional characteristics. Results indicated that waterlogging during grain formation decreased the size of starch granule, proportion of large granule (d > 15 mu m) and ratio of medium-length chains (DP 10-24) in amylopectin, whereas the percentage of high-molecular-weight molecules were increased. Compared with the control, the percentage of ordered starch was increased by waterlogging for both varieties. The changes in starch internal structure under waterlogging had no influence on thermal stability, increased the maximum thermal decomposition ratio and pasting temperatures, and reduced pasting viscosity characteristics in both varieties.

AB The changes in physico-chemical and rheological properties of kithul starch by the impact of energetic neutral nitrogen atoms produced by the glow discharge air plasma with novel technique were analysed. Here, treatment was carried out at different power levels (5 W & 15 W) and treatment time (30 min & 60 min). Decrease in amylose and moisture content and increase in swelling index and solubility of plasma treated kithul starch were observed. Fourier transform infrared spectra of plasma treated starch showed variation in the peaks corresponding to CH2 and OH groups. Relative crystallinity significantly (p <= 0.05) decreased after plasma treatment. Scanning electron microscopy showed severe damages on the starch granular surface by the effect of energetic neutral nitrogen atoms. Pasting properties increased and thermal properties showed significant (p <= 0.05) changes after plasma treatment. Storage modulus (G') and loss modulus (G '') reduced at higher levels of plasma power and it indicated to its weak gel formation.

AB To investigate the potential of terahertz spectroscopy to monitor and quantify starch in plants, terahertz spectra (3.0-13.5 THz) of mung bean plants 1-7 days after germination were examined and compared to those of starch and its constituent saccharides (standard reagents). Day 1 seedlings showed similar spectral features with standard starch, and absorption peaks gradually disappeared in the subsequent 6 day growth period. To interpret this result and identify useful peaks for starch quantification, standard starch and day 1 seedlings were hydrolyzed by a-amylase in vitro. Since both standard starch and seedlings showed that absorption peak at 9.0 THz disappeared after amylase hydrolysis, this peak is sensitive to changes in starch. Additionally, intensity of this peak was correlated with starch content as quantified by chemical analysis (r = 0.98). Our results indicate terahertz spectra of seedlings can provide an identifiable peak that is attributed to starch and not affected by the constituent saccharides.

ID RICE STARCH; FUNCTIONAL-PROPERTIES; TEA POLYPHENOLS; COMPONENTS
AB The effects of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) on the gelatinisation and retrogradation characteristics of wheat starch (WS) were investigated using rapid viscosity analysis (RVA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and Raman spectroscopy. The addition of EGCG resulted in decreased peak viscosity, trough viscosity, final viscosity and setback value of WS, as shown by RVA tests. After storage at 4 degrees C, observations by XRD and TGA revealed that the EGCG-WS complex had lower crystallinity and thermal stability than the control, indicating that EGCG retarded the retrogradation of WS. FT-IR and Raman spectroscopy results showed that EGCG formed hydrogen bonds with WS, through which EGCG could interfere with the reassociation of starch chains during storage, thereby delaying retrogradation. EGCG may therefore prove to be a useful additive in wheat products and in nutrition-related applications.

AB Soy protein hydrolysates (SPH) with different degrees of hydrolysis (DH 0-16%) were obtained by varying the time of hydrolysis with bromelain. The objective of this study was to evaluate how selected techno-functional properties (gelation, emulsification) of SPH were affected by the presence of a non-gelling polysaccharide. A slight hydrolysis was beneficial to increase gel strength. Also, the emulsifying activity was improved for low DHs, whereas hydrolysis was detrimental for emulsion stability. Under certain conditions the presence of the non-gelling polysaccharide was beneficial to improve SPHs' functional properties, but the effect was in general complex and strongly dependent on both biopolymers' concentration and molecular weight. Nevertheless, it was demonstrated that by using SPH and galactomannan mixtures and controlling the biopolymers' concentration and molecular weight, improved functionalities can be obtained with useful applications in food formulation.

AB A novel high-sensitivity authentication method has been demonstrated for the rapid visual detection of adulterated meat based on both the lateral flow strip (LFS) platform and on polymerase chain reaction (PCR). After the rapid extraction of genomic components from meat, the on-site amplification of the target DNA of adulterated duck meat is carried out with the rationally designed functional FITC- and biotin-modified primer set, thereby producing numerous double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) products dually labelled with FITC and biotin. The FITC-labelled terminal end of the products binds to the pre-immobilized FITC antibody on the test line of the strip, and the biotin-labelled terminal end binds to the streptavidin-conjugated gold nanoparticles, resulting in a visible WA line on the LFS for the rapid identification of duck meat in adulterated beef. After optimization, an adulteration ratio as low as 0.05% can be easily measured, which is more sensitive than other common adulteration authentication methods and is even comparable to instrumental methods. Moreover, 22 commercial processed meat samples were tested with this new strategy, and 4 adulterated samples were successfully identified by both the classic method and our method. In essence, the present authentication method is simple in design, convenient in operation, and can be easily extended to the identification of other adulteration components just by replacing the modified primers.

ID AMPEROMETRIC DETECTION; LACTOSE; PURIFICATION; QUANTIFICATION
AB A fully mechanized Arduino-controlled mull-pumping flow analysis system and procedure for the determination of beta-galactosidase activity are proposed. The applied bioanalytical method is based on the determination of p-nitrophenol formed in the course of enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl-galactopyranosides. The photometric detection is performed using dedicated flow-through optoelectronic detector made of paired light emitting diodes. The developed bioanalytical system was applied for evaluation of optimal enzyme detection conditions (pH, temperature and reaction time), selection of appropriate substrate for the assays, comparison of enzymes of different origins (isoenzymes), detection of beta-galactosidase inhibitor and finally to the determination of enzyme activity in some dietary supplements dedicated for people suffering from lactose intolerance. Depending on measurements conditions the developed bioanalytical system allows determination of beta-galactosidase in the wide range of activity (up to 15 U/mL at detection limit ca 0.01 U/mL) with high sample flowthroughput (up to 30 detections per hour). Additionally, the potential utility of the developed analytical system for amyloglucosidase activity assays has been demonstrated.

AB The molecular weight distribution of protein aggregates from raw meat and cooked pork products was assessed by size exclusion-high performance liquid chromatography (SE-HPLC). Electrophoretic analysis under reducing conditions showed that the high molecular weight SE-HPLC peak (peak 1) of the cooked products contained protein aggregates in addition to high molecular weight muscle proteins, while the second peak (peak 2) still contained aggregates and < 50 kDa proteins. The protein aggregates composition was investigated by HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry. Different classes of proteins were identified and the cooked products showed a more complex composition and organization, according to the muscle structure and the technological procedures, respectively. The key role of actin in the building of the protein networks was also confirmed. The different multi-protein systems found in the cooked products suggest protein re-organization in heat-induced supramolecular structures, which might be responsible for the texture and the structural properties of the final products.

AB In this study, ultrasound was used to modulate the molecular structure of retrograded starch (RS3) responsible for the digestion properties, and the relationships among the ultrasonic power, molecular structure, and RS3 digestibility were revealed. Results revealed that the morphological characteristics of RS3 changed after ultrasonic treatment, and high power resulted in more compact block-shape structure. The results of particle size analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction showed that ultrasound decreased the long-range orders but increased the median particle size, short-range orders, and V-type polymorph of ultrasound-treated RS3. A decreased (double helix of amylopectin) and an increased (single helix of V-amylose) enthalpy change were observed by differential scanning calorimeter. Digestion profiles showed that some fractions of rapidly-digestible starch were converted into slowly-digestible starch and/or resistant starch. This study provides a potential approach to regulate the digestion of starch-rich foods with desired digestibility through ultrasonic treatment.

AB This work studied water state of honey during crystallization, obtained statically and dynamically, by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), water activity (a(w)) assessment and time domain nuclear magnetic resonance (TD-NMR).
   Crystallization was induced by adding 5% of crystallized honey to three honey samples with different fructose/glucose ratio, the key characteristic for honey crystallization. Samples were stored at 14 degrees C. Dynamic crystallization was obtained by using an impeller. DSC showed that the dynamic crystallization was faster than the static one, the latter characterized by two phases, showing different rates. The crystallization rate did not affect a(w), that remained below 0.600. TD-NMR allowed to separately observe two kinds of protons, both pertaining to liquid sugars, one chemically exchanging with water and one not exchanging with it. The combination of techniques allowed speculating that the two crystallization methods led to crystals of different size and shape.

AB Escherichia coli was engineered to produce D-pantothenic acid via systematic metabolic engineering. Firstly, genes of acetohydroxy acid synthase II, pantothenate synthetase, 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate hydro-xymethyltransferase, 2-dehydropantoate 2-reductase and ketol-acid reductoisomerase were edited in E. coli W3110 with a resulting D-pantothenic acid yield of 0.49 g/L. Expressions of valine-pyruvate aminotransferase and branched-chain-amino-acid aminotransferase were then attenuated to decrease the carbon flux in L-valine biosynthetic pathway which is a competing pathway to the D-pantothenic acid biosynthetic pathway, and the yield increased to 1.48 g/L. Mutagenesis of pantothenate kinase and deletion of threonine deaminase further increased the production to 1.78 g/L. Overexpressions of panC and panB from Corynebacterium glutamicum enhanced the production by 29%. In fed-batch fermentations, strain DPA-9/pTrc99a-panBC(C.G) exhibited a highest D-pantothenic acid yield of 28.45 g/L. The findings in this study demonstrate the systematic metabolic engineering in Escherichia coli W3110 would be a promising strategy for industrial production of D-pantothenic acid.

AB A two-level Plackett-Burman design with 8 variables was used to evaluate ultrasonic treatment variables influencing the total phenolic content (TPC) extracted from asparagus roots. Steepest ascent method was conducted to identify the significance of parameters such as extraction temperature, stirring speed, intermission time, extraction time, ultrasonic frequency, and ultrasonic power. Ethanol and methanol aqueous solutions were used as extraction solvents and solvent's concentration, extraction time, ultrasonic power and solid: liquid ratio were optimized in this study. A predicted value of TPC (71.1 mg/g) was obtained under the optimum conditions of extraction time 120 min, ultrasonic power 550 W, ethanol concentration of 20% and a solid: liquid ratio of 1:100. Central composite design was employed to further analyse the common interactions between the extraction variables and to further determine the optimal values that would generate the maximum TPC, total flavonoids content, total saponins content, caffeic acid and in vitro antioxidant activities. The optimal variables for ethanol extraction (80 min, 50% of ethanol, 360 W and 1:40) generated higher than methanol (410 W for 114.9 min using 73.7% methanol at 1:24).

AB The aim of this study was to reveal the mechanism of preparing high quality modified starch by grinding. Modified starch and acetylated starch with low degree of substitution were prepared under grinding. The influences of grinding on structures and properties of mung bean starch and quality of acetylated starch were investigated. The influence mechanisms were analyzed using the theory of mechanochemistry and the models of starch granules and molecules. The results indicated that there were pores and umbilical points with loose structure in mung bean starch granules. During the grinding treatment, starch granules were constantly deformed like elastic balls, and starch molecules could keep moving and rearrange, resulting in changes in structures and properties of starch. It could be seen that grinding had a marked mechanochemical effect on starch granules. As a result, the reaction efficiency of the starch rose to 81.61% at 12 h of grinding, and other qualifies (solubility and swelling power) were also improved.

AB To construct a high-performance engineered endo-inulinase for fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) production from inulin, an inulin binding module (IBM) was fused into either N- or C-terminal of an endo-inulinase. After heterologous expression, purification and characterization, the C-terminal fusion one (Eninu-IBM) with better activity, thermostability and inulin binding ability was employed for high-temperature in situ inulin hydrolysis in a 10-L fermentor. During this process, Eninu-IBM was first efficiently produced by the yeast cells at 28 degrees C for 96 h, and subsequently 1600 g unsterilized inulin per liter fermentation liquor was directly supplemented into the bioreactor for FOS production at 60 degrees C for 2 h. Finally, high purity of FOS (91.4%) were obtained with FOS titer, yield and productivity of 717.3 g/L, 0.912 g(FOS)/g(inulin) and 358.6 g/L/h, respectively. The in vitro prebiotic assay indicated that the final FOS products with main polymerization degrees of 3-5 were preferably fermented by beneficial bifidobacteria and lactobacilli.

AB Pereskia aculeata Miller, known worldwide as ora-pro-nobis, is a highly nutritive species of the Cactaceae family from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. In this work, we report inedited information on the phenolic profile of P. aculeata leaves, besides a broad study of their antioxidant potential using a set of five different methods. A total of ten phenolic compounds were identified, such as two phenolic acids (caffeic acid derivatives) and eight flavonoids (quercetin, kaempferol and isorhamnetin glycoside derivatives). Caftaric acid was the extract's major phenolic constituent, accounting for more than 49% of the phenolic content, followed by quercetin-3-O-rutinoside (14.99%) and isorhamnetin-O-pentoside-O-rutinoside (9.56%). Overall, the ora-pro-nobis leaf extract showed relevant values of antioxidant capacity, with higher activities than the Trolox in the DPPH and ABTS trials. The antimicrobial activity exhibited by the extract against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria suggests the presence of a broad spectrum of phytochemicals with antibiotic activity.

AB Spectra data from two instruments (UV-Vis/NIR and FT-NIR) consisting of three and one detectors, respectively, were employed in order to discriminate the geographical origin of milk as a way to detect adulteration. Initially, principal component analysis (PCA) was used to see if clusters of milk from different origins are formed. Separation between samples of different origins were not observed with PCA, hence, feed-forward multi-layer perceptron artificial neural network (MLP-ANN) models were designed. ANN models were developed by changing the number of input variables and the best models were chosen based on high values of generalized R-square and entropy R-square, as well as small values of root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute deviation (Mean Abs. Dev), and -loglikelihood while considering 100% classification rate. Based on the results, whether the spectra data was collected from a single or three detector instrument the same clustering was observed based on geographical origin.

AB The present study studied the effects of fish gelatin (FG) incorporated with grape seed extract (GSE) through vacuum impregnation (VI) on refrigerated tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) fillets over 12 days. The VI of FG-GSE significantly improved the quality of the fish by decreasing drip loss, texture changes, and microbial survival. It also delayed protein oxidation by inhibiting the formation of disulphide bonds and carbonyl groups, and maintaining a higher sulfhydryl content and Ca2+ -ATPase activity. Regarding myofibril degradation, FG-GSE maintained their secondary structure by increasing the ratio of a-helices and 5-sheets (70.88-75.51%). Atomic force microscopy further revealed that the FG-GSE coating preserved the myofibril nanostructure by maintaining their length, width, and height. Overall, the synergistic effects of VI with 3% FG and 0.9% GSE suggested a promising approach for fillet preservation.

AB In our study, octenyl succinic anhydride (OSA)-modified dextrin was prepared and characterized as a novel emulsifier to improve the stability of emulsion and curcumin encapsulation. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy demonstrated the occurrence of esterification between OSA and dextrin (M-w = 1.041 x 10(4)g/mol). The absolute value of zeta-potential of OSA-dextrin increased (from 25.37 mV to 34.57 mV) with increasing OSA addition (from 0% to 8%), and then kept constant. Confocal laser scanning microscope results showed that the debranching and esterification of starch improved the oil droplets distribution and reduced the droplet size of emulsions. The emulsifying stability of emulsions coated by dextrin was greatly improved with OSA modification. The particle size of emulsion decreased significantly when the addition of OSA increased during storage. OSA-modified dextrin was in a position to increase encapsulation efficiency of curcumin. This research may increase the utilization of emulsions stabilized by OSA dextrin in food industry.

AB Sparid fish species have different commercial values related to their organoleptic features. Mitochondrial (mt) DNA provides a potential tool to distinguish species, but the enrichment of high-quality mtDNA from total genomic DNA is critical to obtain entire mtDNA sequences. Conventional mtDNA isolation is relatively low-cost and proficient. However, high numbers of PCR cycles can lead to artefacts (10(-6) mutations/bp). We describe a rapid protocol for mtDNA extraction and enrichment from fish tissues, based on conventional miniprep columns and paramagnetic bead-based purification, without the need to employ PCR amplification.
   This newly described method generates a substrate for next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis and is likely to have wider applications for mitochondrial studies in other fish families to help ensure traceability and differentiation of fish with high commercial values.

AB In the present study, the various properties of pectin extracted using microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) from eggplant peel and eggplant calyx (as food processing wastes of eggplant) were compared with each other. The eggplant peel pectin (EPP) exhibited higher extraction yield (29.17%) than eggplant calyx pectin (ECP; 18.36%). Both of EPP and ECP were high in methoxyl and rich in galacturonic acid. HPLC analysis showed that EPP was high in HG (homogalacturonan) (58.6%), while ECP was high in RG-I (rhamnogalacturonan-I) (44.9%). Also, higher phenolic contents were observed for EPP in comparing with ECP. Approximately in all of the functionalities (WHC (water holding capacity) and OHC (oil holding capacity), emulsifying and foaming properties, and antioxidant activity), EPP showed higher value rather than ECP. H-1 NMR (hydrogen-1 nuclear magnetic resonance), FT-IR (Fourier transform-infrared) and XRD (x-ray diffraction) spectra confirmed the presence of high methylated crystalline pectin in both EPP and ECP.

AB Immunoassays with ultra-high sensitivity for the rapid detection of chemical contaminants in food are urgently required. However, conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) usually suffer from the moderate sensitivity. Herein, we aim to improve the sensitivity of conventional ELISA by employing the fluorescent carbon dots (CDs) as the signal probes based on the principle of inner filter effect (IFE). In this strategy, the enzymatically formed products of horseradish peroxidase/alkaline phosphatase efficiently quenched the CDs via the IFE. The absorption signal of the conventional ELISA was converted into the fluorescence signal. The fluorescent immunoassay was successfully developed and used to detect amantadine residues in chicken, achieving a limit of detection of 0.02 ng mL(-1). The fluorescent immunoassay is a straightforward, extendable and general strategy and exhibits potential in detecting trace amounts of chemical contaminants in foodstuff.

AB The aim of the study was to initiate an exhaustive strategy of control by implementing both targeted and non-targeted metabolomics approaches. A LC-MS/MS method including an oxidative step for most of dyes was developed and validated to target the analysis of 14 residues belonging to different families of dyes. The method was suitable for the quantitative confirmation of 13 dyes at low ppb levels. The metabolomics approach objective was to compare fingerprints between farmed fish treated with malachite green and farmed fish treated with victoria pure blue bo. Analytical information on modifications in the metabolome of muscle, liver and plasma was exploited by HRMS following by multivariate statistics and revealed some direct or endogenous metabolites among relevant mass features contributing to the constructed models. These two approaches, either appropriate biomarkers either enlarged targeted dyes are explored concomitantly to help improving the strategy for tracking new illegal practices in aquaculture.

AB Common bean is rich in phytochemicals like polyphenols, saponins, and steroidal glycosides, but its crop is greatly affected by drought. Thus, it is necessary to identify the irrigation regimes that improves its phytochemical profile without affecting seed yield. The aim of this study was to evaluate the differential effect of severe drought (SD), restricted irrigation (RI), and full irrigation (FI) on the phytochemical fingerprint of bean seeds through liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and chemometric approach. Partial least square-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) indicated that seeds from plants grown under RI where differentiated from those grown under FI and SD due to their high content of quercetin 3-O-rhamnoside and luteolin 7-O-glucoside. Regarding seed yield, no significant (p < 0.05) differences were observed between RI and FI, whereas SD decreased (p < 0.05) seed yield as compared to FI (47%). These results suggest that mild hydric stress (RI) can be used to induce phytochemicals without affecting seed yield.

AB The quality of starchy foods is highly correlated with their amylose content. After boiling or roasting, the amylose content in cooked chestnut starch decreased to 16.6-26.8%, which was significantly lower than that of raw chestnut starch (26.6-28.1%). After cooking, the pasting temperature and peak time increased, while the breakdown, peak viscosity, final viscosity and setback of starches decreased. The amylose content showed a negative correlation with the pasting characteristics of the starch gel of cooked chestnut. The amylose content negatively affected the springiness and chewiness of starch gel, and positively correlated with its cohesiveness and stringiness. The freeze-thaw stability of starch from cooked chestnut was lower than that of raw chestnut. The amylose content was negatively correlated with freeze-thaw stability and positively correlated with the solubility of starch. The results demonstrated that amylose plays an important role in the pasting and gel texture properties of starch during cooking.

AB A new method for extraction and determination of trace and ultratrace impurities from edible oils via an ultrasound-assisted extraction using tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) has been described. Method is simple and sensitive. Extraction variables like pH, concentrations of TMAH and EDTA, ultrasonication and centrifugation times were all optimised for analyzes using engine-oil. Under optimised conditions, extraction of spiked analyzes from all the edible oils into aqueous-medium were investigated and found to be quantitative (89-101%). Using this method, concentrations of impurities in edible-oils were determined by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometer (GFAAS) using standard-addition calibration method and validated with microwave-digestion method. The method was successfully applied to edible oils extracted from various seeds such as mustard oil, sun flower oil, sesame oil, ground nut oil, coconut oil, rice bran oil and corn oil containing ultratrace impurities. Accuracy of developed method for edible-oils was checked with corresponding results obtained by microwave digestion method.

AB Organic acids of wine comprise one of the main taste groups, that of sourness. Two isomeric compounds with molecular weight of 176 u have been identified in wine using two LC-MS systems, LC-IT (ion trap) and LC-Q-Orbitrap. The two isomers are organic acids, 3-isopropylmalic acid (3-IPMA) never identified in wines, and 2-isopropylmalic acid (2-IPMA), never quantified in wines. After the definitive identification against the authentic standards, an analytical method for their determination in wines was optimised and validated using the LC-IT platform. Linearly was verified in the range 5-320 mg L-1 (correlation coefficients higher than 0.9914) and the recoveries obtained spiking the samples at two fortification levels were higher than 86.7%, with RSDs (n = 9) lower than 15.1%. Finally, the two compounds were quantified in ten red and white Italian wines, and average concentrations were determined at 1.78 mg L-1(0.56-4.13) and 23.0 mg L-1(6.7-41.6) of 3-IPMA and 2-IPMA, respectively.

AB This work describes the development of ultrafine fibers with acai (Euterpe oleracea Mart.) extract (AE) for use as pH sensors with potential applications in the food industry. The fibers were produced by electrospinning with polymeric solutions composed of 7% (w v(-1)) polycaprolactone, 2% (w v(-1)) polyethylene oxide and 3% (w v(-1)) AE solubilized in chloroform and methanol (3:1). The mean diameter of the fibers was 1635 +/- 277 nm, with hydrophilic characteristics (contact angle < 90 degrees), a melting point of 58 degrees C and a maximum degradation temperature of 408 degrees C. The total color difference (Delta E) of the colorimetric response was greater than 5, corresponding to the human ability for color differentiation. This new material can be used as a pH sensor for foods such as pork and fish to ensure quality and safety for the consumer, who can visually check the condition of the products.

AB In the present paper, a new analytical preconcentration/speciation method for antimony species determination in bottled mineral water samples using the SiO2/Al2O3/SnO2 adsorbent was developed. The method is based on selective adsorption of Sb(III) ions by SiO2/Al2O3/SnO2 under a wide pH range (2.5-7.5). Total antimony was determined with previous sample treatment using 0.1% (w/v) L-cysteine and the concentration of Sb(V) species was determined by the difference between total and Sb(III). The proposed method provided an analytical curve ranging from 0.50 to 5.00 mu g L-1 (r = 0.999), limit of detection (LD) of 0.17 mu g L-1 and preconcentration factor (PF) of 136-fold. The method exhibited tolerance to different metal ions and the accuracy was attested from addition and recovery tests (95.2-106.0%) in bottled mineral water samples using 2.0% (w/v) L-cysteine, as well as by analysis of certified material. Only Sb(III) species were determined in mineral water (0.54-1.04 mu g L-1).

AB A sequential fractionation procedure based on (i) water extraction, (ii) hexane extraction, (iii) saccharification, and (iv) proteolysis was developed to provide the first ever data on the molecular distribution of iron in maize. This was completed by the operational determination of the iron bioavailability using an in-vitro simulated model for gastro-intestinal digestion. The coupling of hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) and size exclusion chromatography (SEC) with the parallel detection by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and high resolution electrospray mass spectrometry (HR-ESI-MS) allowed the identification of water-soluble Fe(III)-mugineate, Fe(III)-(citrate)(2), and Fe(III)(2)-(phytate)(2). The procedures were applied to study some well characterized maize varieties having shown previously differences in iron bioavailability during cell culture and animal model feeding studies. The combined analytical methods developed in this work could unambiguously discriminate low from high Fe bioavailable seeds in these closely related maize varieties.

AB Effects of various co-pigment sources [gallic acid (GA), rose leaf extract (RLE), cherry stem extract (CSE), pomegranate rind extract (PRE) and green tea extract (GTE)] on anthocyanin content, colour, and turbidity in sour cherry nectar (SCN), sweetened with sucrose (SCNS), maltose syrup (SCNM) or honey (SCNH), were investigated during storage at 20 degrees C. Co-pigment sources were associated with increases in lambda(max) (up to 4.1 nm), colour density (up to 22%), and polymeric colour (up to 1.7 times). Among the co-pigment sources, GA and PRE were associated with the greater anthocyanin stabilities in SCNS and SCNH. Moreover, the lowest turbidity, at the beginning of storage, and turbidity formation rate, throughout storage, were observed in SCNS, SCNM and SCNH containing PRE. When the changes in A(max), lambda(max) polymeric colour, colour density, and turbidity were considered together, PRE was the best co-pigment source, regardless of the sweetener used.

AB We have previously reported how the natural food colorant, bixin, was enzymatically modified by appending sorbitol to the bixin scaffold. The resulted product, sorbitol ester of norbixin (SEN) was expected to be more hydrophilic. The present study aimed to investigate the physical behaviour of SEN in aqueous media. The property of SEN was studied together with non-reacted bixin as separation of the two compounds was unsuccessful. The SEN molecules behaved as a bolaamphiphile in aqueous media, underwent self-association and develop a hydrophilic aggregate. SEN-aggregates could uptake the non-reacted bixin molecules inside its hydrophobic moiety and dispersed it in aqueous media. Aggregation of SEN molecules with incorporated bixin resulted in a hypsochromic shift of the absorption spectra indicting H-aggregation. Dynamic light scattering showed the formation of aggregates with an average hydrodynamic radius 38 +/- 2 nm. The dispersibility of the aggregates was affected by pH and the ionic strength of the media.

AB In this study, wheat starch (WS) was firstly debranched with pullulanase (PUL) and then subjected to repeated heat-moisture treatments (RHMT). The effects of PUL and RHMT on the structure, physicochemical properties and in vitro digestibility of WS were investigated. The proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy confirmed that the ratio of alpha-1,6 glycosidic linkage decreased. Raman and Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy demonstrated that more ordered structure of starch was formed. Differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that RHMT could enhance thermal stability and degree of crystal perfection of PUL-WS sample. Scanning electron microscopy results showed that more agglomerates appeared on the surfaces of RHMT starch granules. The swelling power and solubility significantly decreased after HMT. Additionally, the resistant starch (RS) content of RHMT samples significantly increased. These results suggest that debranching and RHMT can significantly change the physicochemical properties and digestibility of WS, and it's beneficial to the RS formation.

AB This study presents a general bibliometric overview of the major scientific developments that have been published in Food Chemistry, since its first issue (1976). The bibliometric data were retrieved from the scopus database. The review identifies the most cited, productive authors, and the leading institutions and countries of the journal, based on bibliometric indicators. The research hot spots in the period from 1976 to 2016 were identified by using the visualization of similarities software (Vosviewer), and the graphical mapping of the authors was developed to visualize networks between authors. A total of 20,050 publications was analysed and the most influential subjects covered by the journal were identified. Topics related to the antioxidant components of foods and the analytical quantification of contaminants or components of food were identified as being most relevant. The bibliometric analyses indicate a significant evolution of the journal in terms of publications, scientometric performance and themes covered.

AB On-line high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with gas chromatography with flame ionization detector (LC-GC) has become an important technique for the determination of mineral oil aromatic hydrocarbons (MOAH) in foods. However, the analysis is complicated and time-consuming. The present study aimed to develop a fluorescence spectrophotometry approach for the fast screening of MOAH in grains. A reference material, which is a mixture of diesel oils and lubricants, was selected for MOAH calibration. The excitation/emission wavelength of EX230 nm/EM330 nm was determined and the linear range was 0.125-2.5 mg/kg with an R-2 of 0.999. The MOAH content determined by the fluorescence method showed good correlation with that determined by LC-GC (r = 0.946). This result suggested that the performance of these two methods was comparable, and thus fluorescence spectroscopy can be used for screening MOAH. A MOAH content of > 0.1 mg/kg in grains could be rapidly determined by fluorescence spectroscopy.

AB Detection of pathogenic bacteria by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is progressively emerging, although it is still hindered by a complex matrix, long-term bacterial enrichment and low bacterial abundance. Here, we report a novel material based on boronate affinity for recognition and enrichment of bacteria using a pre-PCR method. After optimization, the material exhibited high boronate affinity toward bacteria, with adsorption capacities of S. aureus and Salmonella spp. incubated in 0.01 M PBS (pH 7.4) at 37 degrees C for 15 min calculated as (906.60 +/- 15.73) x 10(7) cfu/g and (582.59 +/- 13.19) x 10(7) cfu/g, respectively, without any bacterial death during the binding process. The material was then applied to enrich S. aureus and Salmonella spp. from the spiked water and 25% cow milk samples followed by mPCR, which resulted in high bacterial enrichment and demonstrated great potential for selective enrichment of bacteria in food samples.

AB Radish anthocyanins were extracted from red radish. The total anthocyanins content (TAC) of the extracts under different extractants was optimized to reach the optimal condition. XAD-7HP was selected as the best resin to enhance TAC in the extracts. beta-Glucosaccharase was chosen as the enzyme to hydrolyse radish anthocyanins. HPLC-MS analysis showed that hydrolysis resulted in an obvious change of the major constituents of radish anthocyanins. Four new constituents in hydrolysed radish anthocyanins were identified. The HPLC-MS results indicated successful hydrolysis of the attachments of glucosides and acids of radish anthocyanins. Furthermore, the FT-IR spectra of radish anthocyanins before and after hydrolysis further described the hydrolysis, which reached 53.36 +/- 0.98% under the best performance. Thus, hydrolysis can significantly enhance the antioxidant and antiproliferative capacities of radish anthocyanins.

AB Acrylamide (AA) analysis is an important topic in food safety. However, it is difficult to rapidly and accurately analyze low concentrations of AA with currently available methods. In the present study, we introduce a highly sensitive method that enables the determination of AA in beverages, grains, and confectioneries by supercritical fluid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (SFC/MS/MS). The sensitivity of the SFC/MS/MS technique is 11-times higher than that obtained by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. We demonstrated that the highly sensitive SFC/MS/MS method was able to quantify low concentrations of AA in beverages (i.e., roasted barley tea and coffee) extracts at less than 10 mu g kg(-1) level without solid-phase purification. Furthermore, the simplification of the sample preparation procedure provided an improvement in data acquisition time (60 samples per 12 h). In conclusion, the developed analytical system is a potentially useful tool for practical AA determination.

AB Anthocyanin-rich extracts derived from the bran of a select Thai black rice cultivar, Leum Pua, were encapsulated by spray drying. In this microencapsulation method, twelve wall materials comprising maltodextrin (M), gum arabic (G), whey protein isolate (W), and their combinations were employed. For comparison, an ionic gelation method was employed using alginate-whey protein isolate (AL-W) as a wall material. Thirteen microcapsules were analysed by scanning electron microscopy, and their encapsulation efficiencies were almost 100%, except for that of the W (83%). M (88%) and its combination with W exhibited the best anthocyanin retention, while pure W contained the highest amount of total phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity. An in vitro digestion study using simulated gastrointestinal fluids revealed the highest released total phenolic content and antioxidant activity of the intestinal fluids when the microcapsule was spray-dried with pure W.

AB Nanocellulose obtained from banana rachis (NCBR) was loaded (through simple impregnation) with a polyphenolic-rich extract (PRE) of Andean berries (Vaccinium meridionale). The adsorption/desorption of polyphenols onto NCBR and the thermal stability and antioxidant activity of the polyphenolic-NCBR nanocomplex (NCX) was studied. Thermodynamic properties (Delta H-ads degrees, Delta S (ads)degrees, and Delta G(ads)degrees) showed that polyphenols interact with NCBR by physisorption through a spontaneous and exothermic process. The NCX kept the original color of PRE (magenta) and released polyphenols in aqueous medium (80% of phenolic compounds in the first hour and 50% of anthocyanins in the first few minutes). The NCX showed high antioxidant activity, as evidenced by traditional assays, and inhibited the peroxyl radicals mediated oxidation of a tryptophan-containing peptide. Additionally, NCX inhibited lipid peroxidation in an emulsified system of Sacha inchi oil exposed to accelerated oxidative conditions. In conclusion, the NCX showed good properties as an antioxidant with potential use as a food additive.

AB Ancient apple cultivars are known for their organoleptic properties over a small geographic area, but little is known of their nutraceutical properties, which might be useful in large-scale breeding programmes. Nine ancient apple cultivars from Tuscany (Italy) were characterized for their organoleptic properties, phenolic profiles, and antioxidant activity. These cultivars had high polyphenol concentrations (principally flavanols and phenolic acids) and high total antioxidant capacity compared with most commercial apple cultivars. Fruits from the cultivars 'San Michele' and 'Del Debbio' showed a good compromise between fruit size and solid soluble content, and might be suitable for fresh consumption, while fruit from 'Benito', 'Della Piastra', 'Lugliese Grisanti', 'Del Sangue' and 'Ruggine' had high polyphenol contents and excellent antioxidant capacity, and may be suitable for breeding programmes. 'Ruggine' fruit could also be used for sweet juices with good nutraceutical properties due to their high soluble solid content and high flavanol concentration.

AB Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was applied for the species-specific identification of meat and bone meal (MBM), based on genomic DNA characteristics. A total of 51 source-reliable MBM samples, including porcine, poultry, bovine, and ovine MBM, were analysed. Genomic DNA was extracted using an optimized procedure for FTIR scanning. The results showed that a series of discriminatory FTIR spectral bands were closely related to DNA characteristics of MBM. The spectral intensity difference at 1651 cm(-1 )was identified as a key peak for discriminating ruminant from non-ruminant MBM. Combining FTIR data with chemometrics, a two-step protocol for discriminant analysis was established. An initial identification model of porcine, poultry, and ruminant MBM and a second model of bovine and ovine MBM were established. The results obtained using two models showed that the correct classification rate was 100%. This method could assist governments in confirming the authenticity of species to ensure feed safety.

AB Separation and enrichment of phenolic components from Citrus medica L. var. sarcodactylis were performed to improve the antibiofilm and antibacterial activity/efficiency of the fractions for the first time. Through separation of the crude extracts, the preparation of four fractions was done by chromatography on macroporous resin. It was found that the antibiofilm and antibacterial activity of the fractions were significantly enhanced. The obtained 30% ethanol eluted fraction (EEF) and 60% EEF both significantly inhibited biofilm formation. After the second separation by polyamide resin chromatography, the activity of the fractions was also improved. Complete inhibition (100%) on biofilm formation of S. aureus was achieved at 2.0 mg/mL. The MIC of the fractions on S. aureus was decreased to 2.0 mg/mL. There has been variation of 7.3-185.6 mg/g of phenolic content in the fractions, and a strong correlation between the anti-biofilm, the antibacterial activity and the phenolic content. Chemical composition analysis showed the EEF comprised 17 phenolic compounds. Moreover, the obtained EEF exhibited much higher antibacterial activity in tofu than crude extract. Therefore, chromatography separation significantly improved the antibacterial and antibiofilm activity/efficiency of the fractions both in vitro and in tofu.

AB Banana has non-starch polysaccharides (NSP) in its cell wall similar to dietary fiber from cereals like oats. These NSP could be used as potential functional ingredient due to their prebiotic action and potential food immunomodulators. However, NSP purification is limited due to high quantities of soluble sugars accumulate during banana ripening. The aim of this study was to extract soluble sugars from ripe banana (Musa cavendishii var. Nanicao) to obtain a purified NSP matrix. Two different extraction methodologies (solid-liquid extraction SLE and ultrasound-assisted extraction UAE) were tested using ethanol (99.5 mL/100 mL) as solvent. Soluble sugars were quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). SLE and UAE showed to be effective in extraction process of soluble sugars. Best results were obtained with SLE at sample/solvent ratio of 1:5, 65 degrees C and 30 min of extraction time. A solid residue with NSP was obtained, that could be used as a functional ingredient.

AB This study analyzed six uvaia (Eugenia pyriformis Cambess) accessions ('Comum', 'Rugosa', 'Doce de Patos de Minas', 'Pera', 'Rugosa Doce' and 'Dura') with respect to chemical composition, nutritional value, bioactive compounds and antioxidant capacity. The 'Rugosa Doce' and 'Doce de Patos de Minas' accessions were sweeter (20.18 g 100 g(-1) and 18.88 g 100 g(-1), respectively), while the 'Rugosa' and 'Vera' accessions were less acid (0.28 g 100 g(-1)and 0.33 g 100 g(-1), respectively). Terpenes were the major volatile compounds (46.75%) identified by SPME-GC/MS. The 'Rugosa' accession contained high levels of fibers (43.81 g 100 g(-1)) and minerals (2235.10 mg 100 g(-1)). The 'Rugosa Doce' and 'Rugosa' accessions were distinguished by total flavonoids and phenolic compounds. 'Rugosa Doce' and 'Rugosa' may potentially serve as a raw material for food, while 'Doce de Patos de Minas' and 'Vera' can be used for cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries purposes.

AB Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is an important enzyme with antioxidant function. The activity of purified SOD from chestnut rose was increased by 22.23-38.02% after high pressure processing (HPP, 100-500 MPa/0-20 min/30-50 degrees C). The properties of SOD induced by high pressure were studied by means of electrophoresis, dynamic light scattering, enthalpy and surface hydrophobicity, circular dichroism and fluorescence spectrometry. Results showed that high pressure did not change the electrophoretic properties, particle size distribution, digestive system stability and antioxidant capacity of SOD. However, the enthalpy and surface hydrophobicity of SOD was increased. The increase of SOD activity was related to the increase of SOD surface hydrophobicity. Moreover, the alpha-helix fraction of SOD was decreased by 8.7% and the intrinsic fluorescence intensity of SOD was increased by 5.7% when exposed to high pressure. This study suggested that HPP can be used as a novel way of increasing the activity of SOD in chestnut rose.

AB Raman spectroscopy is a rapid and non-destructive analytical technique that has found a growing interest in the characterization and quantification of microconstituents in foods. In this work, Raman spectroscopy was used to evaluate the carotenoids content of processed Bunchosia glandulifera, a native fruit from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. The B. glandulifera pulps were dried in hot air at 65 and 85 degrees C, resulting in carotenoids degradation of about 75 and 80%, respectively. The degradation profile of carotenoids over time was analyzed by Raman spectroscopy, with and without the use of an internal standard (TiO2). The reproducibility of the analyses was evaluated by PCA of spectral data. PLS regression was applied for modelling the total carotenoids in B. glandulifera. Resulting models show the Raman data correlate with carotenoids content on samples resulting in a satisfactory coefficient of determination for all sets of samples.

AB Sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides L.) pulp oils (SPOs) are rich in a variety of beneficial bioactive ingredients. Nevertheless, SPOs would be exposed to plastic equipment during processing, resulted in increasing phthalates contents and edible risk, as well as affecting oil quality. For these reasons, the effects of two stages steam distillation (SD2) and two stages molecular distillation (MD2) on phthalic acid esters (PAEs) content were investigated and compared in the present work. Compared with SD2, MD2 showed higher removal rates of seven selected PAEs from the SPO. Even if the initial concentration of DBP and DEHP in R-SPO were 1.626 and 10.933 mg/kg respectively, the concentration of DBP and DINP could be reduced below the limit set by China government after treated with MD2. Besides that, there was no trans-fatty acids generated in SPO during the distillation process.

AB The effect of various beer marinades on formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in charcoal-grilled chicken wings (CWs) and the active ingredients in beer contributing to inhibition of PAH formation were studied. The 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging activity and total phenolic content (TPC) of six beers were evaluated. LC-MS analysis indicated a total of 32 phenolic compounds, among which we screened 11 to verify the inhibition of select PAH production. The total stable free radicals and selected PAH content of charcoal-grilled CWs were assayed, revealing a positive correlation. Heineken exhibited the highest phenol content and excellent performance in TPC (393.86 mg gallic acid equivalents (GAE)/L), ability to scavenge free radicals (27.0%), and the most effective inhibition of PAH8 formation (67%). Our study supplies a theoretical foundation for using edible materials rich in phenolic compounds as potential natural inhibitors of PAHs formed during the cooking process.

AB dscCfaE is a recombinant form of the CFA/I tip adhesin CfaE, expressed by a large proportion of enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC). It is highly immunogenic by the intranasal route in mice and Aotus nancymaae, protective against challenge with CFA/I+ ETEC in an A. nancymaae challenge model, and antibodies to dscCfaE passively protect against CFA/I+ ETEC challenge in human volunteers. Here, we show that transcutaneous immunization (TCI) with dscCfaE in mice resulted in strong anti-CfaE IgG serum responses, with a clear dose-response effect. Co-administration with heat-labile enterotoxin (LT) resulted in enhanced immune responses over those elicited by dscCfaE alone and strong anti-LT antibody responses. The highest dose of dscCfaE administered transcutaneously with LT elicited strong HAI titers, a surrogate for the neutralization of intestinal adhesion. Fecal anti-adhesin IgG and IgA antibody responses were also induced. These findings support the feasibility of TCI for the application of an adhesin-toxin based ETEC vaccine.

AB In 2017, a mumps outbreak occurred in a barrack holding 249 service members. Suspected cases were evaluated with a combination of mumps IgG, IgM, viral culture, PCR and sequencing. Seven cases were diagnosed in febrile patients presenting with parotitis or orchitis. Mumps infection was confirmed by IgM or positive PCR with 5/7 cases having notable IgG levels before infection. Sequencing confirmed mumps genotype G strain. Serum from all 249 service members collected prior to the outbreak was withdrawn from the Department of Defense (DoD) Serum Repository and the IgG values of measles, mumps and rubella determined with 20.2%, 12.3% and 9.7% service members being seronegative, respectively. No specific IgG seronegativity combination predicted IgG marker levels to another virus within the same vaccine. This paper provides additional evidence that mumps serology is not a reliable surrogate for mumps immunity and that we need better laboratory correlates to confirm immunity.

TI Clinical trials with GMO-containing vaccines in Europe: Status and

SO VACCINE
LA English
DT Review
DE Genetically modified organism; GMO; Vaccines; Vector-based vaccines;
   Regulation; Clinical trials contained use; Deliberate release
AB Recombinant technology has revolutionised the way novel vaccines are developed and manufactured. The possibility to genetically modify micro-organisms to bring immunogenic material (antigens/epitopes) to the human (or animal) immune system to provoke an immune response, provides new hope to producing prophylactic vaccines against HIV, malaria and tuberculosis and emerging diseases. Regulatory requirements associated with the development of genetically-modified organism (GMO)-containing vaccines in Europe add an additional burden to the clinical trial application procedure and to the preparation and initiation of a clinical trial of such vaccines. Moreover, the GMO regulatory framework is complex and only partially harmonised across Europe, which may hamper multi-country clinical trials with GMO-containing vaccines. This paper provides an overview of clinical trial applications with GMO-containing vaccines in Europe and reviews the regulatory framework in countries where GMO-containing vaccine clinical trial authorisation (CTA) applications were submitted between 2004 and 2017.

AB The Glade 2.3.4.4 H5Nx is a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus, which first appeared in China and has spread worldwide since then, including Korea. It is divided into subclades a - d, but the PR8-derived recombinant Glade 2.3.4.4 a viruses replicate inefficiently in embryonated chicken eggs (ECEs). High virus titer in ECEs and no mammalian pathogenicity are the most important prerequisites of efficacious and safer vaccine strains against HPAI. In this study, we have synthesized hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes based on the consensus amino acid sequences of the Glade 2.3.4.4a and b H5N8 HPAIVs, using the GISAID database. We generated PR8-derived H5N8 recombinant viruses with single point mutations in HA and NA, which are related to efficient replication in ECEs. The H103Y mutation in HA increased mammalian pathogenicity as well as virus titer in ECEs, by 10-fold. We also successfully eradicated mammalian pathogenicity in H103Y-bearing H5N8 recombinant virus by exchanging PB2 genes of PR8 and 01310 (Korean H9N2 vaccine strain). The final optimized H5N8 vaccine strain completely protected against a heterologous Glade 2.344c H5N6 HPAIV in chickens, and induced hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody in ducks. However, the antibody titer of ducks showed age-dependent results. Thus, H103Y and 01310PB2 gene have been successfully applied to generate a highly productive, safe, and efficacious Glade 2.344 H5N8 vaccine strain in ECEs. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Flu vaccines administered intramuscularly (IM) have shown seasonally fluctuating efficacy, 20-60%, throughout the last 15 years. We formulated a recombinant H5 (rH5) in our Nanovax (R) (NE01) (rH5/NE01) adjuvant for intranasal vaccination in ferrets. We evaluated the regimen, one vs two immunization, and cross Glade protection a ferret challenge model.
   Methods: Plant derived recombinant H5 (rH5) antigen was formulated with NE01 and administered intranasally to ferrets. Immunogenicity (IgG), hemagglutination inhibition (HI), and protection against lethal challenge, were measured following one or two immunizations. Protection against homologous (strain A/Indo) and heterologous (strain A/Vn) was evaluated in ferrets following two immunizations.
   Results: IN immunization with rH5/NE01 induced significant IgG levels after one and two immunizations. One vaccination did not induce any HI while low HI was measured after two immunizations. Homologous challenge with H5N1 A/ Indonesia showed 100% survival, with minimal weight loss in animals vaccinated twice compared to the unvaccinated controls. Analysis of nasal wash from these challenged ferrets vaccinated twice showed decreased viral shedding compared to unvaccinated controls. Interestingly, animals that received one vaccination showed 88% survival with moderate weight loss. Cross Glade protection was evaluated using an increased antigen dose (45 jig rH5). Vaccinated animals demonstrated increased IgG and HAI antibody responses. Both homologous (A/Indo) and heterologous challenge (A/ Vietnam) following two immunizations showed 100% survival with no loss of body weight. However viral clearance was more rapid against the homologous (day 3) compared to the heterologous (day 5) post challenge.
   Conclusion: Intranasal administration of NE01 adjuvant-formulated rH5 vaccine elicited systemic and probably mucosal immunity that conferred protection against lethal challenge with homologous or heterologous viral strains. It also enhanced viral clearance with decreased shedding. These outcomes strongly suggest that intranasal immunization using NE01 against flu infections warrants clinical testing.

AB Background: Vaccination strategies against bacterial meningitis vary across countries. In the United States, a single dose of quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenACWY) is recommended at 11-12 years of age, with a booster dose approximately 5 years later. We assessed immune responses to a booster dose of MenACWY-CRM vaccine after priming with MenACWY-CRM or MenACWY-D vaccines in adolescents and adults.
   Methods: In this phase Illb, multicenter, open-label study, healthy 15-55-year-olds, who received MenACWY-CRM (N = 301) or MenACWY-D (N = 300) 4-6 years earlier or were meningococcal vaccine naive (N = 100), received one MenACWY-CRM vaccine dose. Immunogenicity was evaluated pre vaccination, 3 or 5 days post-vaccination (sampling subgroups), and 28 days post-vaccination by serum bactericidal activity assay using human complement (hSBA). After vaccination, participants were monitored for 7 days for reactogenicity, 29 days for unsolicited adverse events (AEs), and 181 days for serious AEs and medically-attended AEs.
   Results: Sufficiency of the immune response to a MenACWY-CRM booster dose was demonstrated; the lower limit of the 1-sided 97.5% confidence interval for percentages of participants with hSBA serore-sponse at 28 days post-vaccination was >= 75% for each serogroup in those primed with either the MenACWY-CRM or MenACWY-D vaccine. Seroresponse was observed in >= 93.24% of primed participants and >= 35.87% of na ve participants 28 days post-vaccination. At 5 days post-booster, among primed participants, hSBA titers >= 1:8 were achieved in >= 47.14% of participants for MenA and in >= 85.52% of participants for MenC, MenW and MenY, and 3.25- to 8.59-fold increases in hSBA geometric mean titers against each vaccine serogroup were observed. No safety concerns were raised throughout the 6-month follow-up period.
   Conclusions: A booster dose of the MenACWY-CRM vaccine induced a robust and rapid anamnestic response in adolescents and adults, irrespectively of either MenACWY-CRM or MenACWY-D vaccine administered 4-6 years earlier, with an acceptable clinical safety profile.

AB Vaccination coverage among adults remains low in the United States. Understanding the barriers to provision of adult vaccination is an important step to increasing vaccination coverage and improving public health. To better understand financial factors that may affect practice decisions about adult vaccination, this study sought to understand how costs compared with payments for adult vaccinations in a sample of U.S. physician practices. We recruited a convenience sample of 19 practices in nine states in 2017. We conducted a time-motion study to assess the time costs of vaccination activities and conducted a survey of practice managers to assess materials, management, and dose costs and payments for vaccination. We received complete cost and payment data from 13 of the 19 practices. We calculated annual income from vaccination services by comparing estimated costs with payments received for vaccine doses and vaccine administration. Median annual total income from vaccination services was $90,343 at family medicine practices (range: $3968-$249,628), $28,267 at internal medicine practices (-$32,659-$141,034) and $2886 at obstetrics and gynecology practices (-$73,451-$23,820). Adult vaccination was profitable at the median of our sample, but there is wide variation in profitability due to differences in costs and payment rates across practices. This study provides evidence on the financial viability of adult vaccination and supports actions for improving financial viability. These results can help inform practices' decisions whether to provide adult vaccines and contribute to keeping adults up-to-date with the recommended vaccination schedule. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

ID EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB Invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) is one of the leading causes of bacterial meningitis and septicemia in Israel. The purpose of the study was to describe the IMD in the Tel Aviv District and to identify specific populations who could benefit from vaccine introduction.
   In the Tel Aviv District, the incidence rates ranged from 0.4 to 1.4 cases per 100,000 population per year during 2007-2017.
   During the study period, seventy-nine patients (65%) occurred among children younger than four years of age. Eight deaths occurred (7%), most of them among children under the age of 1 year (5 deaths; 15%). A serogroup was identified in 82 isolates. Most of the isolates (69 cases - 84%) belonged to serogroup B (NmB).
   IMD clustered geographically in the city of Bnei Brak, with a predominantly Ultra-Orthodox Jewish population. It is the youngest and most densely populated city in the district. The overall incidence rates of IMD among children in Bnei Brak were more than seven times higher in children up to nine years, compared to the rest of the district. Specifically for NmB, disease rates were 9.08 times higher in children up to the age of four, and 7.74 times higher in children from five to nine years old in Bnei Brak, compared to the rest of the district.
   Our findings describe the burden of a vaccine-preventable disease and reinforce the need for routine 4CmenB introduction, especially in groups where the disease clusters. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Millions of infants worldwide remain under-immunized and at risk for unnecessary morbidity and mortality. Text messaging may offer a low-cost solution. We aimed to evaluate text message reminders to improve infant immunization in Guatemala.
   Methods: A randomized clinical trial was conducted at four public health clinics in rural and urban Guatemala. Infants ages six weeks to six months presenting for the first visit of the primary immunization series were randomly and equally allocated to an intervention or usual care group. Intervention participants were sent three text reminders before the second and third vaccine visits. The main outcome was timeliness of the second and third visits of the primary immunization series.
   Results: Of 1088 families approached for enrollment between March to November 2016, 871 were eligible and 720 (82.7%) participated; only 54 families did not own a cell phone. Due to country-wide vaccine shortages, visit completion was used as a proxy for overall immunization coverage. In intention to treat analysis, both intervention and usual care groups had high rates of visit completion, but intervention participants presented on the scheduled date more often (151[42.2%] of 358 intervention vs. 111 [30.7%] of 362 usual care participants for visit 2, p = 0.001, and 112 [34.0%] of 329 intervention vs. 90 [27.0%] of 333 usual care participants for visit 3, p = 0.05). Intervention caregivers were significantly more likely to want to receive future text message reminders for vaccines and other appointments and were more willing to pay for these reminders.
   Conclusion: Caregivers who were sent text message reminders in urban and rural Guatemala were less delayed for their child's immunization visits and reported high user satisfaction. Text message reminders may be an effective tool to increase infant vaccination coverage in low-income settings by reminding parents to vaccinate. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction: Streptococcus pneumoniae is a leading cause of bacteremia, bacterial pneumonia, and meningitis, and is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality, particularly in those under 2 years of age and those over 65 years of age. While significant progress against S. pneumoniae-related disease has been made as a result of the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV7, PCV10 and PCV13), there remains value in further expanding pneumococcal vaccine serotype coverage. Here we present the first report of a 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV20) containing capsular polysaccharide conjugates present in PCV13 as well as 7 new serotypes (8, 10A, 11A, 12F, 15B, 22F, and 33F) which are important contributors to pneumococcal disease.
   Methods: This Phase I first-in-human study was a randomized, controlled, observer-blinded study with a two-arm parallel design to assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of PCV20 in adults. A total of 66 healthy adults 18-49 years of age with no history of pneumococcal vaccination were enrolled and randomized to receive a single dose of PCV20 or a licensed tetanus, diphtheria, acellular pertussis combination vaccine (Tdap) control. Local injection site reactions, select systemic symptoms, laboratory studies, and adverse events were assessed. Opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) titers and IgG concentrations were measured in sera collected prior to, and approximately one month (28-35 days) after vaccination.
   Results: Vaccination with PCV20 elicited substantial IgG and functional bactericidal immune responses as demonstrated by increases in IgG geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) and OPA geometric mean titers (GMTs) to the 20 vaccine serotypes. The overall safety profile of PCV20 was similar to Tdap, and generally consistent with that observed after PCV13 administration.
   Conclusions: Vaccination with PCV20 was well tolerated and induced substantial functional (OPA) and IgG responses to all vaccine serotypes. There were no safety issues identified in this Phase 1 study, and the data supported further evaluation of PCV20. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Seasonal influenza vaccines represent a positive intervention to limit the spread of the virus and protect public health. Yet continual influenza evolution and its ability to evade immunity pose a constant threat. For these reasons, vaccines with improved potency and breadth of protection remain an important need. We previously developed a next-generation influenza vaccine that displays the trimeric influenza hemagglutinin (HA) on a ferritin nanoparticle (NP) to optimize its presentation. Similar to other vaccines, HA-nanoparticle vaccine efficacy is increased by the inclusion of adjuvants during immunization. To identify the optimal adjuvants to enhance influenza immunity, we systematically analyzed TLR agonists for their ability to elicit immune responses. HA-NPs were compatible with nearly all adjuvants tested, including TLR2, TLR4, TLR7/8, and TLR9 agonists, squalene oil-in-water mixtures, and STING agonists. In addition, we chemically conjugated TLR7/8 and TLR9 ligands directly to the HA-ferritin nanoparticle. These TLR agonist-conjugated nanoparticles induced stronger antibody responses than nanoparticles alone, which allowed the use of a 5000-fold-lower dose of adjuvant than traditional admixtures. One candidate, the oil-in-water adjuvant AF03, was also tested in non-human primates and showed strong induction of neutralizing responses against both matched and heterologous H1N1 viruses. These data suggest that AF03, along with certain TLR agonists, enhance strong neutralizing antibody responses following influenza vaccination and may improve the breadth, potency, and ultimately vaccine protection in humans.

AB Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a highly contagious viral infection of cloven hooved animals that continues to cause economic disruption in both endemic countries or when introduced into a formally FMD free country. Vaccines that protect against clinical disease and virus shedding are critical to control FMD. The replication deficient human adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) vaccine vector expressing empty FMD virus (FMDV) capsid, AdtFMD, is a promising new vaccine platform. With no shedding or spreading of viral vector detected in field trials, this vaccine is very safe to manufacture, as there is no requirement for high containment faciitites. Here, we describe three studies assessing the proportion of animals protected from clinical vesicular disease (foot lesions) following live-FMDV challenge by intradermolingual inoculation at 6 or 9 months following a single vaccination with the commercial AdtFMD vaccine, provisionally licensed for cattle in the United States. Further, we tested the effect of vaccination route (transdermal, intramuscular, subcutaneous) on clinical outcome and humoral immunity. Results demonstrate that a single dose vaccination in cattle with the commercial vaccine vector expressing capsid proteins of the FMDV strain A24 Cruzeiro (Adt.A24), induced protection against clinical FMD at 6 months (100% trans dermal, 80% intramuscular, and 60% subcutaneous) that waned by 9 months post-vaccination (33% trans dermal and 20% intramuscular). Post-vaccination serum from immunized cattle (all studies) generally contained FMDV specific neutralizing antibodies by day 14. Anti-FMDV antibody secreting cells are detected in peripheral blood early following vaccination, but are absent after 28 days post-vaccination. Thus, the decay in antibody mediated immunity over time is likely a function of FMDV-specific antibody half-life. These data reveal the short time span of anti-FMDV antibody secreting cells (ASCs) and important performance characteristics of needle-free vaccination with a recombinant vectored subunit vaccine for FMDV.

AB Clostridium perfringens is a major cause of food poisoning worldwide, with its enterotoxin (CPE) being the major virulence factor. The C-terminus of CPE (C-CPE) is non-toxic and is the part of the toxin that binds to epithelial cells via the claudins in tight junctions; however, C-CPE has low antigenicity. To address this issue, we have used protein engineering technology to augment the antigenicity of C-CPE and have developed a C-CPE-based vaccine against C. perfringens-mediated food poisoning. Moreover, C-CPE has properties that make it potentially useful for the development of vaccines against other bacterial toxins that cause food poisoning. For example, we hypothesized that the ability of C-CPE to bind to claudins could be harnessed to deliver vaccine antigens directly to mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues, and we successfully developed a nasally administered C-CPE-based vaccine delivery system that promotes antigen specific mucosal and systemic immune responses. In addition, our group has revealed the roles that the nasal mucus plays in lowering the efficacy of C-CPE-based nasal vaccines. Here, we review recent advances in the development of C-CPE-based vaccines against the major bacterial toxins that cause food poisoning and discuss our C-CPE-based nasal vaccine delivery system.

AB Quinoa seeds have high protein content and an exceptional balance of amino acids, with higher contents of lysine, methionine and cysteine than common cereals. To date, only three globulins, all of which have a content of lysine mass that does not exceed 3.8%, have been identified in quinoa. To address the protein present in quinoa seeds, TCA/Acetone protein extraction was performed using four different quinoa seed genotypes with contrasting edaphoclimatic origins. Proteins were identified and analyzed using label-free shotgun proteomics followed by in silica analysis, using the three published quinoa genomes. This analysis allowed us to identify sixteen globulins, thirteen of which are novel: nine legumin-like proteins and seven vicilin-like proteins. Seven of the novel proteins contain 7.5% or more of lysine mass, justifying the high content of lysine repeatedly reported in quinoa seeds. No significant differences were found between the four genotypes here analyzed.

AB The bioaccessibility and speciation of arsenic (As) in rice grains have been investigated by the physiologically based extraction test (PBET) method. A total of 42 rice samples were collected from Hunan Province, a typical mine-impacted province in China. The bioaccessibility in the gastrointestinal tract was 71.7 +/- 13.5% for the collected rice grains. Arsenite [As(III)] was the predominant As species in the simulated gastric and gastrointestinal solutions, followed by dimethylarsinic acid (DMA), arsenate [As(V)] and monomethylarsonic acid (MMA). The bioaccessible As(V) was irrelevant to As(V) in the rice grains, suggesting that interconversion between As(V) and other species was occurred in the simulated gastrointestinal tract. Monte-Carlo simulation was introduced to assess the health risk from exposure to inorganic As. The average values for target hazard quotient (THQ) and bioaccessible THQ were 2.704 and 1.637, respectively. The inclusion of bioaccessibility reduced the probability of non-carcinogenic health risk from 97.32% to 76.86%.

AB To determine the key aroma compounds in Chinese rice wine (CRW), four types of CRW (YH, JF, SN, and XX) were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), gas chromatography-olfactometry (GC-O), and sensory evaluation. The contributions of the key aroma compounds to the flavor characteristics were determined by partial least squares regression. Sixty-one aroma compounds were detected. Twenty-five components were identified as odor-active compounds. On the basis of their odor active values, 18 odor-active compounds were determined as key aroma compounds. Ethyl isovalerate, ethyl butyrate, ethyl acetate, ethyl hexanoate, and phenylethyl alcohol were key aroma compounds in all four types of wine. The unique key aroma compounds of JF wine were isovaleraldehyde and isoamyl acetate; those of XX wine were 1-butanol, benzaldehyde, ethyl benzoate, ethyl phenylacetate, 2-octanone, and furfural; that of YH wine was ethyl 2-methylbutyrate; and those of SN wine were 1-butanol, 1-hexanol, 2-butenoic acid ethyl ester, and 3-methyl-1-butanol.

AB High consumer demand has led global food color manufacturers and food companies to dramatically increase the development and use of natural colors. We have previously reported that avocado (Persea americana) seeds, when crushed in the presence of air, develop a red-orange color in a polyphenol oxidase-dependent reaction. The objective of this study was to identify the major colored compound in colored avocado seed extract (CASE). Column chromatography and high performance liquid chromatography were used to isolate the most abundant colored compound in CASE. This compound, henceforth referred to as perseorangin, was a yellow-orange solid. Structural analysis was performed using high-resolution mass spectrometry, and infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. We determined that perseorangin is a glycosylated benzotropone-containing compound with a molecular formula of C29H30O14. Liquid chromatography with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry-based metabolomic analysis of CASE and uncolored avocado seed extract showed that perseorangin was unique to CASE.

AB Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), were compared to quantify uric acid and antioxidant reducing agents in 36 milk samples. The enzymes uricase and ascorbate oxidase were used to remove uric and ascorbic acids and showed that the peaks obtained by CV and HPLC did not contain contributions from other unknown compounds. The levels of uric acid obtained by CV compared well to those determined using HPLC, with only a few exceptions, and the average difference was around 6%. CV measurements were made using the main anodic peak seen at approximately 330 mV (Ag/AgCl), while a later oxidation peak at approximately 650 mV can be associated with further reducing agents present in milk. The electrochemical method was quicker to apply than HPLC that included a pre-treatment step, and provides an inexpensive and simple method for the reliable analysis of uric acid in milk.

AB Low alcohol hulless barley wine (HW) is a popular beverage among the highland areas in China. It is known to have several health benefits due to the presence of beta-glucan and antioxidant compounds. Therefore, the total beta-glucan content, total phenols and flavonoids of HW samples from the highland areas of Sichuan province and Tibet were determined in this study. The results indicated that HW is abundant in both beta-glucan (54-76 mg/L) and phenolic compounds (131-178 mg/L). Moreover, this study also investigated the flavor and aroma characteristics of HW samples. A total of forty six volatile aroma substances were identified by GC-MS. The HWs could be classified into three distinct groups in terms of the region of origin according to the results of PCA based on the GC-MS data. These findings provide a useful foundation for further study of the health benefits and the flavor characteristics of HW in highland areas.

AB Milk by-products such as whey and caseinate are widely used as ingredients or processing aids in food industry. However, since they could cause allergic reactions they are included in Allergen Control Plans. beta-Lactoglobulin is the major whey protein and caseins are main proteins in milk. Selection of a unique target to analyze the presence of milk in foods could be insufficient when the source of milk proteins is unknown. A new test based on lateral flow immunocromatography that combines the simultaneous and independent detection of both proteins (beta-lactoglobulin and casein) in one rapid test was developed. The assay was validated according to AOAC guidelines being able to detect beta-lactoglobulin (0.5 ppm), casein (2 ppm), whey and powder milk (1-5 ppm). No cross-reactivity was found with a panel of 38 food commodities. The method is a rapid and suitable tool to identify milk proteins in processed food, ingredients, and rinsing water.

AB We designed Air-in-Oil-in-Water (A/O/W) emulsions. First, Air-in-Oil foams were fabricated by whipping anhydrous milk fat. The maximum overrun was obtained at 20 degrees C. The foams contained 30-35 vol% air and were stabilized solely by fat crystals. To refine the bubble size, foams were further sheared in a Couette's cell. The average bubble size reached a value as small as 6.5 mu m at a shear rate of 5250 s(-1). The nonaqueous foams were then dispersed in a viscous aqueous phase containing sodium caseinate to obtain A/O/W emulsions. The shear rate was varied from 1000 to 7500 s(-1), allowing to obtain Air-in-Oil globules whose average diameter ranged from 15 to 60 mu m. To avoid globule creaming, the aqueous phase was gelled by incorporating hydroxyethyl cellulose. Homogeneous emulsions were obtained with fat globules containing around 22 vol% of residual air. The systems were kinetically stable for at least 3 weeks at 4 degrees C.

AB The bioavailability of drugs can be improved by regulating the structural properties, particularly lipoid systems, such as niosomes, can increase cellular uptake. Herein, we optimized double emulsion and niosomal formulations for encapsulating anthocyanin-rich black carrot extract. Nanoparticles obtained by selected formulation were characterized in terms of morphology, particle size, drug encapsulation efficiency, in vitro release and cytotoxicity. The optimum conditions for niosomal formulation were elicited as 30 mg of cholesterol, 150 mg of Tween 20 and feeding time of 1 min at a stirring rate of 900 rpm yielding the lowest average particle size of 130 nm. In vitro release data showed the majority of the encapsulated anthocyanins were released at the end of 10 h. A mathematical model was developed to estimate the absorption of anthocyanins released from niosomes and cytotoxicity was assessed against neuroblastoma. Overall, these findings suggest that niosomal vesicles might be suitable delivery systems for anthocyanins.

AB A simple biologically active phenolic methyl gallate (MeG) was used as a model compound to identify the nature of the complexes it formed with Al3+, Fe3+, Cu2+, and Sn2+ as analyzed by ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopic and computational methods. The results showed that, among all the metal ions studied in the present study, MeG has the highest formation constant with Al3+, and the complexation between MeG and metal ions is a pH-dependent reaction. At pH 6.0, complexes with a stoichiometry of 1:1 were formed with Al3+, Fe3+, and Sn2+, whereas 2:3 complexes were formed with Cu2+. Using a functional density quantum-chemical method, it was shown that the ligand involved in the complexation of MeG-Al undergoes significant changes in electronic delocalization. Modeling of electronic spectra with water as solvent shows high reproducibility for the experimental features of the complexes. The calculations confirm that chelation of Al3+ occurs at the double-deprotonated phenolic hydroxyls.

AB The main object of study is application of whey protein concentrate (WPC) and whey protein hydrolysate (WPH) for probiotic encapsulation. The controlled enzymatic hydrolysis was applied to change technological properties of WPC what leads to obtained different carriers. Probiotic carriers (beads) were made by electrostatic extrusion. Bead properties (mechanical properties, FTIR fingerprint, cell release) and parameters of fermentation were examined. According to cell release, it can be concluded that WPH build less porous matrix with alginate than WPC. Beads with WPH contained more living cells and suffered more changes during fermentation than beads with WPC. Probiotic viability in simulated gastrointestinal conditions (SGIC) is the most critical parameter for probiotic encapsulation. Probiotic encapsulated in protein-alginate beads survived SGIC with more than 96% viable cells, compared to 37.43% for free culture. According to all examined parameters, it can be concluded that WPH builds more suitable carrier for probiotic culture than WPC.

AB A simple and rapid method for simultaneous determination of pesticides and mycotoxins in red wine is presented. Sample preparation approach, called direct injection, consists of a sequence of only three steps: centrifugation, dilution and filtration. The analysis of extracts were performed by UPLC-MS/MS for determination of pesticides and mycotoxins. The method was assessed for linearity, limits of detection and quantification, matrix effects, selectivity, accuracy and precision. For recovery experiments, mycotoxins were divided in two groups according to their sensitivity in the UPLC-MS/MS system. More than 80% of the mycotoxins were reliably quantified at the lowest spike level studied (1 mu g kg(-1) for group 1 and 50 mu g kg(-1) for group 2). From the 185 evaluated pesticides, 144 showed acceptable results at 10 mu g kg(-1), the lowest spiked level. Matrix effects were, in most of the cases, negative, and that was observed for both pesticides and mycotoxins.

AB In this work, the effect of beta-sitosterol (Sito) on vesicle characteristics, physicochemical stability as well as the in vitro release and bioavailability of curcumin-loaded liposomes (Cur-LP) was studied. When 20-33 mol% of Sito was incorporated, encapsulation efficiency of curcumin was improved due to the high amount of liquid-ordered domains in membranes. At 50 mol% Sito a lower encapsulation efficiency was observed possibly due to membrane defects. The physical, thermal and photo stability of curcumin in liposomes were markedly improved with increasing the amount of Sito. First-order kinetics fitted best the curcumin release dynamics of Sito containing liposomes, clearly showing that sustained release improved with increasing amounts of Sito in liposomes. Simulated digestion studies suggested that Sito concentration of about 20-33 mol% improved the bioavailability of curcumin in liposomes. These study shows that Sito is an applicable and potential route in forming healthier cholesterol-free curcumin-loaded liposomes for functional supplements.

AB Defects with textures and flavors are a common problem, causing many economic losses in the dry-cured ham industry. To obtain a better understanding of the defects of dry-cured ham, texture, protein denaturation, protein structure, and water distribution of normal and defective hams were investigated. Compared with normal ham, more than 1.5-fold values in adhesiveness and bitterness, and less than 0.8-fold values in hardness were found in defective ham. The intense denaturation of sarcoplasmic proteins and actin, and the dramatic transformation of a-helix to beta-sheet were the key modification of proteins; a high proportion (92.39%) of immobile water contributed to the excessive softness and adhesiveness of defective hams. Furthermore, high denaturation of proteins could accelerate the degradation of proteins, which further developed the bitterness and adhesiveness of defective hams. Partial least squares regression demonstrated that the discrepancies in protein denaturation, protein structure and water distribution were related with bitterness and adhesiveness of Jinhua ham.

AB A fast and simple method, which employs QuEChERS and HPLC-UV, was developed to determine preservatives in processed foods from different classes. The method showed correlation coefficients above 0.99, LOQs between 0.13 and 0.33 mg kg(-1) and recoveries between 91 and 107%, with RSD <= 5.3%. Levels of preservatives were up to 2040 mg kg(-1) for benzoates, up to 3185 mg kg(-1) for sorbates and up to 452 mg kg(-1) for methylparaben. Only four out of 82 samples under analysis were above the maximum level allowed by the legislation. Additionally, daily intakes of preservatives were estimated. Regarding benzoates, relatively high intakes were estimated (25% of the acceptable daily intake - ADI) in comparison with sorbates (5% of ADI) and parabens (< 1% of ADI), when mean consumption is considered. This method is a good alternative to determining preservatives in different food samples.

AB The effects of the natural ingredients Angelica sinensis (AS) and Codonopsis pilosula (CP) on the shelf life of chicken seasoning were investigated. Color differences and sensory evaluation were used to indicate sensory differences. Changes in volatiles were monitored. The rate of increase in the color value a* of the AS and CP samples was lower than that in the control. Rancid flavor appeared later in the AS and CP samples than in the control. The levels of aldehydes, ketones, and alkenes increased during storage. A kinetic model was built based on the proportion of aldehydes (main marker), to predict shelf life. The predicted shelf life at room temperature was 60 days for the control, 114 days for AS, and 89 days for CP. The shelf life of chicken seasoning could be prolonged with AS and CP. This kinetic model can be used to predict the shelf life of chicken seasoning.

AB Dried persimmon is thought to be a rich source of non-extractable polyphenols (NEPPs). Here, we analyzed the NEPP content of dried persimmon and its bile acid-binding activity in vitro. To determine total NEPP content and epicatechin equivalent (ECE) of intact NEPPs, acid hydrolysis and non-destructive methods with 70% (v/v) acetone-insoluble solids (AIS), respectively, were conducted using Folin-Ciocalteu reagent. The ECE of intact NEPPs exceeded 1000 mg/100 g in the non-destructive method, but total NEPP content was approximately 3900 mg/100 g with the acid hydrolysis method. Thiolysis showed that the non-extractable proanthocyanidins in dried persimmon mainly comprised epigallocatechin-gallate, epigallocatechin, epicatechin, and epicatechin-gallate. AIS from dried persimmon showed stronger bile acid-binding activity than AIS from apple, quince, and fresh astringent persimmon. These results suggest that the high content of NEPPs in dried persimmon may contribute to a strong bile acid-binding activity.

AB Thymol oil-in-water nanoemulsions as a potential natural alternative for synthetic antioxidant agents were developed. The nanoemulsions were formulated using Quillaja Saponin bio-surfactant and green solvents including high oleic sunflower oil (HOSO), tricaprylin (TC), and cinnamaldehyde (CA). The 4% thymol nanoemulsions containing TC and HOSO remained stable during long-term storage (at least 30 d). The antioxidant activity (AA) of free thymol and thymol nanoemulsions was compared with butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and ascorbic acid. The results obtained from DPPH, FRAP, and CUPRAC antioxidant assays showed a substantial improvement (p < 0.05) of the AA of free thymol through emulsification. The outcomes from the AA of the nanoemulsions in raw chicken breast meat measured by the TBARS assay revealed a significant improvement (p < 0.05) of the AA when thymol was encapsulated. These nanoemulsions may be applicable in the food industry as well as in cosmetic and health care products.

AB Nobiletin, a polymethoxyflavone mainly found in citrus fruits, have been reported to exhibit various beneficial biological activities for human health. It is an important bioactive compound in traditional Chinese medicine, Pericarpium Citri Reticulatae and Fructus Aurantii. To detect the contents of nobiletin in citrus and herb samples, we developed an indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (icELISA) based on monoclonal antibodies. It possessed a median inhibition concentration (IC50) of 2.43 +/- 0.19 ng/mL and a working range of 0.52-12.3 ng/mL. The assay exhibited the average recoveries of 72.5-85.3% in citrus peel, pulp and juice samples. Moreover, eleven citrus cultivars samples and four herb samples were also detected by the icELISA. The nobiletin content varied in different citrus cultivars samples and herb samples, which were confirmed by the ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS). These results indicated that the developed immunoassay was suitable for detecting nobiletin in citrus and herb samples.

AB Blackcurrant juices were prepared without enzyme (NEB-juice) and with conventional enzyme-aided berry pressing (EB-juice). Juices were pasteurized and stored at ambient temperature (in light and dark conditions) and at +4 degrees C for a 1-year period of time. Volatile composition and odor attributes were followed by HS-SPME-GC-MS and a sensory panel, respectively. Volatiles were decreased in the EB-juice, showing 100-fold lower contents of the main terpenoids, e.g., alpha-pinene, delta-3-carene, limonene, terpinolene, bornyl acetate and beta-caryophyllene; whereas esters, such as methyl butanoate and ethyl butanoate, showed 2- and 4-fold lower contents for the EB-juice. Pasteurization produced minor changes in both juices. Volatiles decreased during storage at room temperature while at +4 degrees C esters and eucalyptol were kept at 100%. The descriptive sensory analysis reported a significant decrease (p < 0.05) of the berry-like odor after 12-month storage at RT. Storage at +4 degrees C for 12 months did not affect the odor quality.

AB Olive leaves have become a promising source of phenolic compounds and flavonoids with high added value. Phenolic compounds and flavonoids are important sources of antioxidants and bioactives, and one of the processes used to effectively produce them is extraction via solvents, using aqueous ethanol solutions. To obtain the highest extraction yield per kg of biomass, olive leaves were extracted using a conventional technique (dynamic maceration) and an emerging technology, such as pressurized liquid extraction. Studies of the factors that influence these processes were performed: temperature, leaf moisture content, solvent/solid, and aqueous ethanol concentration were optimized using the central composite and Box-Behnken experiment designs. Pressurized liquid extraction resulted in more efficient oleuropein and luteolin-7-O-glucoside extraction than dynamic maceration. The operational conditions for maximizing the recovery of phenolic compounds and flavonoids and antioxidant capacity were determined to be 190 degrees C, leaf moisture content of 5%, and aqueous ethanol concentration of 80%.

AB Antioxidant molecules in honey contributed to various biological effects, but antioxidant components markers in honey are required to be investigated further. Phenolic compounds, flavonoids and free amino acids were analyzed using UPLC-MS/MS and HPLC-FLD from 39 honey samples, in which fennel honey was firstly investigated. Based on the quantitative composition-activity relationship, the cellular antioxidant activity (CAA) assay of various honeys is closely related with the interaction of some phenolic compounds (isoferulic acid, 3,4-dihydroxy benzoic acid, 4-hydroxy benzoic acid, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, gallic acid, cryptochlorogenic acid, p-coumaric acid, salicylic acid), flavonoids (isosakuranetin, sakuranetin, pinocembrin, vitexin, taxifolin, galangin, luteolin, chrysin) and free amino acids (Tyr, Gly, Ile, Glu, Val, Phe, Leu, Asp, His, Pro, Ala). The results would be beneficial for the understanding of the nutritional values, exploitation and utilization of honeys with different floral origins, further contributable to the market development and consumption choice of honey.

AB The influence of various freeze-thaw cycles on the physicochemical and histological properties of lightly salted tuna meat was studied. Enhanced water-holding capacity and springiness were obtained in the salted samples even after repeated freezing-thawing, which was ascribed to the modifications in tissue microstructure, ice crystal morphology, and protein properties. Intracellular and spherical ice crystals were observed in the salted meat, rather than the extracellular and large ice columns in the unsalted counterparts. Proteins in the salted meat were more sensitive to the stresses imposed by freezing-thawing and would form hydrophobic interactions more readily. Excessive freeze-thaw cycles accelerated the discoloration of salted meat, probably due to the decreased oxidative stability by salt. The overall quality properties of lightly salted tuna meat could be better maintained when subjected to no more than three freeze-thaw cycles.

AB A generic extraction and UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap (TM)-HAMS method was developed for four insect species (mealworm, grasshopper, house cricket and black soldier fly) analyzing a large spectrum of organic chemical contaminants, including pesticides (n = 25), (veterinary) drugs (n = 29), and mycotoxins (n = 23). To prove the method as 'fitfor-purpose', a successful validation was performed, both qualitatively, by determining the screening detection limit (SDL), selectivity and specificity, as well as semi-quantitatively, by assessing the within-day precision (relative standard deviation (RSD)) and recovery. For both the mealworm, grasshopper, house cricket and black soldier fly, 64, 61, 59 and 62 compounds were detected at the respective SDL levels (1-100 mu g kg(-1)), predominantly below existing maximum residue limits for other edible matrices. Mean recoveries ranged between 70% and 120% and RSD-values were in line with European regulations (CD 2002/657/EC; SANCO). Finally, the potential of the screening methodology was demonstrated on real insect samples, revealing minor to no contamination.

AB The purpose of this research was to prepare nanogels by covalent cross-linking carboxymethyl starch (CMS) and chitosan hydrochloride (CHC) as novel delivery systems for curcumin. The spherical structure of CHC-CMS nanogels was verified by transmission electron microscopy. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy confirmed that the amide linkage was formed between CHC and CMS. X-ray diffraction data exhibited that the crystalline structure of CHC was destroyed after covalent cross-linking with CMS, which further confirmed that the CHC-CMS nanogels were formed. Furthermore, the nanogels behaved as viscoelastic solids over the entire frequency range. Meanwhile, the nanogels showed excellent pH-sensitivity and high encapsulation efficiency of curcumin (89.49%-94.01%). Compared to free curcumin, curcumin encapsulated in nanogels displayed sustained release profile in simulated gastrointestinal conditions. These results suggested that the nanogels had been successfully fabricated and could be used as ideal carriers for curcumin and other bioactive compounds in functional foods.

AB Near-infrared microscopy (NIRM) technology can analyze different components within a sample while also obtaining spatial information about the sample. No rapid detection methods are available for effectively identifying antibiotic mycelia residues (AMRs) in protein feeds materials to date. In this study, the feasibility of using NIRM to identify AMRs (oxytetracycline residue, streptomycin sulfate residue and clay colysin sulfate residue) mixed in cottonseed meals was studied. The samples were scanned by NIRM, then the spectra of images were analyzed by principal component analysis (PCA) to select characteristic bands for further identification with one-class partial least squares analysis (OCPLS). The results showed that: a) AMRs were effectively identified in cottonseed meal; b) screening characteristic bands and increasing the spectral number of the calibration set improved the identification results of the model; and c) the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and class error of the method were 100%, 95.93%, 99.01% and 2.03%, respectively.

AB Soybean oil is often contaminated by aflatoxin B-1 (AFB(1)) which is regarded as a class I carcinogen. The feasibility of rapid determination of AFB(1) in soybean oil with terahertz spectroscopy was examined. t-SNE, as the pretreatment method was used to get the best features and combined with different chemometrics including least squares-support vector machines (LS-SVM), back propagation neural network (BPNN), random forest (RF) and partial least squares (PLS) to find the best determination model. The excellent prediction results could be obtained using BPNN combined with t-SNE with correlation the coefficient of prediction (R-p) was 0.9948 and the root-mean-square error of prediction (RMSEP) was 0.7124 mu g/kg. Besides, THz spectroscopy was proved to be feasible to detect AFB(1) at 1 mu g/kg in soybean oil (over 90% accuracy). It was concluded that THz spectroscopy together with chemometrics would be a promising technique for rapid determination of the AFB(1) concentration in soybean oil.

AB This study was conducted for quantitative determination of quercetin in food and fruit juice samples based on a green, fast, and accurate method namely, micro-cloud point extraction (MCPE). The proposed MCPE is essentially a miniaturized form of traditional cloud point extraction (CPE) in which only a few microliters of micellar extracting phase is sufficient for determination. Factors influencing the extraction efficiency, such as amount of Triton X-114 (5%, v/v), effect of pH, amount of Na2SO4 salt (5%, w/v) and time of centrifugation were investigated and optimized by experimental design. Under the optimized condition, the calibration range was found to be linear over 10-100 ng mL(-1) with the limit of detection of 2.2 ng mL(-1). The relative standard deviation of 2.8%, was obtained on a 30 ng mL(-1) quercetin standard solution (n = 3). Finally, the proposed method was successfully applied for the determination of quercetin in onion, tomato, apple and orange juice samples.

AB Iprodione is a fungicide widely used in viticulture in most agricultural countries. It was banned recently in the European community because of its carcinogenic and endocrine disrupting characters. In this work, a cheap analytical method able to monitor iprodione in a white wine was developed. Molecularly imprinted sol-gel polymers (MIS) specific to iprodione and using green solvents were synthesized. An experimental design having the following factors (solvent volume and crosslinker quantity) was used to prepare an optimal MIS. In terms of selectivity, the optimal MIS showed the best partition coefficient towards iprodione in a white wine containing four other competing fungicides (procymidone, pyrimethanil, azoxystrobin and iprovalicarb). A solid phase extraction method using the optimal MIS was optimized and applied to analyse iprodione in a white wine. Low detection and quantification limits were reached 11.7 and 39.1 mu g/L respectively.

AB Ziziphus plants are well recognized for their nutritive and medicinal value worldwide, albeit their chemical profile has yet to be fully reported. The secondary metabolites profile of three traditionally used Ziziphus leaf accessions was investigated via ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to photodiode array and electrospray ionization mass detectors (UHPLC/PDA/ESI-MS). A total of 102 metabolites were characterized revealing the first holistic approach onto Ziziphus leaf metabolome and to include the first report of several novel flavonoids and cyclopeptide alkaloids. Fragmentation pattern for cyclopeptide alkaloids was proposed via ESI-MS. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed close metabolite resemblance among Z. spina-Christi and Z. mauritiana leaf specimens found enriched in saponins and distinct from that of Z. jujuba in which quercetin-3-O(2-pentosyl)-rhamnoside was most abundant. Further, in-vitro antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antidiabetic assays revealed for Z. spina-Christi and Z. mauritiana strong effects compared to Z. jujuba and in correlation with their metabolites repertoire.

AB Physicochemical and thermal characteristics of concentrated lactose solutions containing 0.05, 1, or 4% (w/w) of three acids commonly used in the food industry, i.e., lactic, citric, and phosphoric acid, were studied. Properties of both lactose and water were affected by all acids studied. Thermographic analysis showed that interactions between water and acids hindered evaporation of water from most of lactose solutions. This effect was mostly related to the formation of a strong hydration layer around lactose molecules by hydrogen bonds. Acid-induced hydrolysis of lactose into glucose and galactose varied depending on the concentration, hydrolytic power of acids and molecular interactions in the system. The study concluded that the varying physical, chemical, structural and thermal characteristics of lactose as affected by the presence of different acids was mainly due to the manipulation of water-lactose interactions, whereas the hydrolysis of lactose by the acids plays a smaller role.

AB This study reported a novel highly active alkaline urate oxidase (UOX) and demonstrated its application in reducing uric acid content of food under alkaline conditions. The UOX gene was cloned from Arxula adeninivorans NBRC 10858, and its N-terminally his(6)-tagged form (rUOX) was overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The rUOX displayed maximal activity at 40 degrees C and pH 10, kept more than 90% initial activity under alkaline conditions (pH 9-11) and more than 80% at temperatures below 55 degrees C. The apparent K-m, turnover number (k(cat)) and catalytic efficiency (k(cat)/K-m) values for the substrate uric acid were respective 29.15 mu M, 151.16 s(-1) and 5.19 s(-1). mu M-1, which are improvements over previously reported UOXs. The rUOX efficiently reduced uric acid and purine contents in beer, beef and yeast extract at pH 10, indicating a promising application in food with low purine and uric acid contents to prevent hyperuricemia and gout.

AB Gray mold caused by Botrytis cinerea is the most important disease in postharvest tomato fruit. Inducing resistance to fungal pathogens in the harvested fruit and vegetable is a promising approach to control postharvest losses. In the present study, the effect of L-glutamate on induction of resistance to B. cinerea and the underlying mechanisms were investigated. The results indicated that L-glutamate at 100 ppm was effective in reducing the gray mold of tomatoes after inoculation of the pathogen. Gene expressions of nine glutamate receptors, four pathogenesis-related proteins and the content of amino acids were affected by L-glutamate treatment. Furthermore, the metabolites of L-glutamate, including GABA, Met, Lys and Arg, could also induce significant resistance against B. cinerea in tomato fruit. Our findings suggested that L-glutamate treatment may represent a promising method for managing postharvest decay of tomato fruit.

AB The contamination of pesticide residues in Oolong tea has raised much concern in recent years. The objective of this study was to synthesize gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and develop surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) methods for detection and quantification of pesticides in Oolong tea. Facile synthesis of spherical and monodispersed AuNPs with an average diameter of 15 nm was achieved, which induced strong electromagnetic fields in SEAS analysis. AuNP substrates were employed for rapid detection and quantification of carbendazim in Tieguanyin Oolong tea. Partial least squares (PLS) analysis and leave-one-out cross validation were utilized in spectral data analysis. The PLS results for Oolong tea samples were obtained: R value = 0.964; the detection limit = 100 mu g/kg. These results demonstrate that SEAS coupled with gold nanoparticle substrate is a simple, rapid, and sensitive analytical tool for measurement and quantification of carbendazim residues in Oolong tea.

AB A headspace sampling-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (HS-GC/MS) method using mild HS conditions (40 degrees C, 30 min) was established, validated in terms of specificity, linearity (1.75-87.65 ng mL(-1)), precision (0.3-9.1% RSD), and accuracy (81.1-117.7%); and applied for the monitoring of 900 commercial beverage samples of six different types. These mild (low-temperature) conditions were compared with 1) optimized (high-temperature) conditions and 2) a liquid-phase microextraction method involving no heat treatment. This method was desirable because a high equilibrium temperature induced artefactual benzene formation from benzoate and ascorbic acid. In a 2(IV)(8-3) fractional factorial design, eight variables-ascorbic acid, benzoate, benzaldehyde, Cu2+, Fe2+, riboflavin, pyridoxine, and heat treatment-were tested as potential factors affecting benzene formation. All variables except Fe2+ and pyridoxine significantly affected benzene formation, both individually and interactively. The present study suggests an accurate and reliable method for benzene analysis and provides strategies to prevent unintentional benzene formation in beverages.

Triggering signaling H2O2 accumulation arising from elevating NADPH oxidase enzyme activity during 6 days of storage at 4 degrees C may be pivotal for promoting shikimate dehydrogenase enzyme activity in mushrooms treated with ATP during 18 days of storage at 4 degrees C. Promoting melatonin accumulation (390 mu g kg(-1) FW vs. 160 mu g kg(-1) FW) in mushrooms treated with ATP during cold storage may attribute to signaling H 2 0 2 accumulation. Higher DPPH scavenging capacity (72 % vs. 65 %) in mushrooms treated with ATP may attribute to higher phenols accumulation arising from higher phenylalanine ammonialyase/polyphenol oxidase enzymes activity concomitant with higher alternative oxidase gene expression during 18 days of storage at 4 degrees C.

AB Garcinia madruno is a neotropical tree characterized by its exotic fruit and its functional compounds. The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression and variability of the chemical markers of G. madruno according to the part of the plant used, the origin and the ripeness stage by applying chemometric tools. A total of 167 samples were evaluated, and 27 compounds were quantified per sample. The expression of amentoflavone, morello-flavone-type biflavonoids and polyisoprenylated benzophenones (PIBs) promoted intergroup differentiation, whereas the expression of GB-2a-type biflavonoids promoted intragroup cluster generation. Epicarp was the main source of biflavonoids and the secondary source of PIBs, with values up to 25% in some individuals. The origin of the fruit significantly impacted the expression of metabolites, whereas the ripeness stage did not. The results indicate that epicarp is a good source of functional compounds and, with appropriately agronomic development, could be improved even more.

AB Oxidation of omega-3 fatty acids is a major limitation on its enrichment in food and beverages. An efficient and simple method to monitor lipid oxidation in complex systems is essential to limit lipid oxidation during formulation and processing. Fish oil-in-water emulsions (20% v/v) were exposed to iron or free radical initiated oxidation. Conjugated dienes (CDs) were rapidly measured using a previously developed fat extraction method. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy has been used to directly record chemical changes occurring during oxidation. Variations were noticed in different spectral regions despite the presence of broad water bands near 3400 and 1640 cm(-1). Partial least squares regression (PLSR) revealed correlations between CD values and full FTIR spectra (4000-600 cm(-1)), and different spectral regions (e.g., 1800-1500 cm(-1),1500-900 cm(-1)). These correlations confirm that FTIR spectroscopy is a rapid and simple method for measuring lipid oxidation in complex foods without prior fat extraction.

AB Gallic acid liposomes (GA-LIP) and gallic acid liposomes decorated with lactoferrin (LF-GA-LIP) were fabricated, and their physiochemical, in vitro digestion and antibacterial activity were analysed. The average particle size of LF-GA-LIP was larger than that of GA-LIP, and the former had a higher encapsulation efficiency and storage stability. Electrostatic interaction existed between lactoferrin and the phospholipid bilayer. Spherical structures of both were observed by transmission electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. Gallic acid existed in an amorphous form in both liposomes. Hydrogen bond was formed between the hydroxyl groups of gallic acid and the polar head of phospholipid in the liposomes. LF-GA-LIP displayed a delayed-release effect compared with GA-LIP in simulated digestion. It exerted higher antibacterial properties against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus than GA-LIP. The findings suggested that the liposomes decorated with lactoferrin could be developed as a favourable delivery system for a potential application in the food industry.

AB This paper proposes the use of random forest for adulteration detection purposes, combining the random forest algorithm with the artificial generation of outliers from the authentic samples. This proposal was applied in two food adulteration studies: evening primrose oils using ATR-FTIR spectroscopy and ground nutmeg using NIR diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. The primrose oil was adulterated with soybean, corn and sunflower oils, and the model was validated using these adulterated oils and other different oils, such as rosehip and andiroba, in pure and adulterated forms. The ground nutmeg was adulterated with cumin, commercial monosodium glutamate, soil, roasted coffee husks and wood sawdust. For the primrose oil, the proposed method presented superior performance than PLS-DA and similar performance to SIMCA and for the ground nutmeg, the random forest was superior to PLS-DA and SIMCA. Also, in both applications using the random forest, no sample was excluded from the external validation set.

AB A green and simple method was designed to synthesize polyethyleneimine (PEI)-modified magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), which were later used as adsorbents in magnetic solid phase extraction (MSPE) process. A new MSPE-HPLC method was then established for the simultaneous determination of four representative synthetic colorants (Amaranth, Ponceau 4R, Sunset yellow and Allure red) in food samples. Several important factors, such as the pH of the sample solution, the amount of adsorbent, the adsorption time, and the type of the eluent were investigated in detail. Under the optimized experimental conditions, the four colorants were measured with good linearity, detection limit and quantification limit. Adsorption kinetics and isotherms were also investigated to elucidate the adsorption mechanism. The detection of four colorants in candy, jelly and carbonated drink proved that the established MSPE-HPLC method was simple and effective and can be used for the analysis of colorants in real samples.

AB Camellia oil is a high quality oil mainly produced in southern China. It is common that unscrupulous merchants attempt to make huge profits by adulterating camellia oil with other cheaper or lower-quality vegetable oils. Therefore, this paper proposed excitation-emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy combined with chemometric methods for the rapid identification and quantification of camellia oil adulteration with other cheaper vegetable oils. A five-component parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) model roughly completed spectral characterization of oil samples, and obtained chemically meaningful information. Four advanced chemometrics methods were used for the classification of camellia oil and other vegetable oils (model 1) and the classification of camellia oil and adulterated camellia oil (models 2 and 3), respectively. Two-directional two-dimensional linear discriminant analysis ((2D)(2) LDA) was used for chemical data for the first time and showed huge potential. Furthermore, the developed N-PLS regression model used for the prediction of adulteration level in camellia oil showed satisfactory accuracy.

Larger expansion volume was obtained in the carrot chips derived from GT, which accompanied with superior textural qualifies compared with the chips derived from JT and VT. Remarkable differences were obtained in the amount of pectic fractions, galacturonic acid content, degree of methoxylation, sugar composition and linearity of CWPs that fractionated from different tissue zones of raw carrots. The characteristics of CWPs was confirmed to be a substantial factor that significantly affected the expansion ratio and textural properties of the DIC-dried carrot chips, which providing a mechanistic insight of the relationship between variation in CWPs and the expanding behaviors of DIC-dried fruits and vegetables.

AB In this study, the efficiency and practical utilization feasibility of niosomal and liposomal nanovesicles loading Isoleucine-Proline-Proline (IPP) as suitable ingredients of functional beverages were evaluated. Vesicles were tailored by different preparation methods using phospholipid and non-ionic surfactants. The optimization process was performed by central composite design approach. The results of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy demonstrated the compatibility of IPP with the vesicles. The phospholipidic nanovesicles, produced by modified ethanol injection-microchannel technique, were smaller with lower polydispersity index than non-ionic surfactant vesicles developed by the method of thin film hydration and probe sonication. However, niosomal model functional beverage exhibited more proper palatability, biological activity and physicochemical properties during long-term storage than liposomal one. Moreover, niosomes exhibited more sustained release behaviour in simulated blood fluid than liposomes. These findings are of great importance for design and development of the functional foods containing IPP.

AB Considering the negative impacts on human health and the environment, determinations of arsenic (As) and antimony (Sb), is of unquestionable importance. The present study describes the development of innovative and practical deep eutectic solvent (DES) based vortex assisted microextraction (DES-VAME) method for preconcentration of As and Sb from environmental waters, honey and rice prior to analysis by hydride generationatomic absorption spectrometry (HG-AAS). The use of As(III) and Sb(III) in presence of dithizone at pH 10.5 by means of donor-acceptor mechanism were decided as analyzes. Total As and Sb were determined after reduction process. The analytical properties obtained following optimization were as follows. Limit of detection (LOD), precision (as RSD%), recoveries and enhancement factor for As and Sb were calculated as 7.5 ng L-1/1. 5.6 ng L-1, 2.1% /2.7%, 93.5%/96.2% and 104/85, respectively. Following validation with certified reference material, the method was successfully applied to the analysis of real samples.

AB The endogenous carbon quantum dots (CQDs) produced during food processing have potential uncertainty to human health. The objective of this study was to investigate the formation, biodistribution and cytotoxicity of CQDs in roasted Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar Linnaeus). The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis showed that the CQDs were mainly composed of carbon, oxygen and nitrogen. The morphology, functional groups and optical properties were highly dependent on the roasting time. In vivo experiments in mice demonstrated that the CQDs distributed in the digestive tract, kidney, liver, and even brain, which indicated that they could cross the blood-brain barrier. The cell imaging results indicated that the CQDs could readily gain access to the normal rat kidney (NRK) cells, and caused autophagosome formation. The proportion of live cells decreased to 34.62% at 6 mg mL(-1) of CQDs, and the energy generation route was changed from aerobic to glycolytic metabolism.

AB To explore the involvement of protein lysine acetylation in the conversion of muscle to meat, a quantitative analysis of the acetylome in postmortem porcine muscle with or without antemortem stress was conducted. In total, 771 acetylpeptides containing 681 lysine acetylation sites mapping to 176 acetylproteins were identified. Acetylproteins were enriched in muscle contraction, carbohydrate metabolism, cell apoptosis and calcium signaling. Bioinformatic analysis suggests that preslaughter handling may be associated with glycolysis in postmortem muscle and the overall meat quality, via acetylation of multiple enzymes of glycogenolysis/glycolysis, regulate rigor mortis via acetylation of contractile, ATP production and calcium signaling-related proteins, and regulate stress response, cell apoptosis and meat tenderization via regulating the functions of heat shock proteins and permeability transition pore complex. This study provides the first overview of the acetylome in postmortem muscle as affected by preslaughter handling and broadens knowledge of the biochemistry regulating meat quality development.

AB We studied the polyphenol profile and antioxidant properties of cooked whole-wheat pasta to evaluate its effective antioxidant capacity, including changes produced by its production and in vitro digestion. The polyphenol profile was studied by HPLC-ESI-MS/MS, while the antioxidant capacity was measured by TEAC and FRAP assays. Results show that the polyphenol profile and antioxidant capacity change along the elaboration of cooked pasta, being the cooking step important to increase the release of bound polyphenols, enhancing their antioxidant properties. On the other hand, the study of the bioaccessibility of polyphenols, using an experimental model that simulates human gastrointestinal digestion and subsequent absorption, showed that only a small fraction of the starting polyphenolic compounds, mainly free polyphenols, could be absorbed by the small intestine; thus, reducing their effective antioxidant capacity. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing the bioaccessibility of hydroxybenzoic acid glucoside, hydroxybenzoic acid diglucoside, tryptophan, 6-C-glucosyl-8-C-arabinosyl-apigenin and diferulic acids.

AB Traditional methods evaluating fish quality do not involve comprehensive qualification and quantification of quality-related components. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of vacuum impregnated fish gelatin (FG) and grape seed extract (GSE) on metabolites of tilapia fillets during storage using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Totally 42 metabolites were identified, 36 of which were quantified. The multivariate analysis results demonstrated distinct separations between fresh and stored fillets, indicating significant metabolite changes during storage. Some metabolites like choline and trimethylamine oxide were closely related to freshness while organic acids were associated with spoilage. Combined FG and GSE reduced the formation of undesirable metabolites like trimethylamine and histidine significantly (P < 0.05). Traditional freshness indexes indicated preserved quality after combined coating and further verified NMR results. This study reveals the potential of NMR to analyse metabolites that determine fish quality and to monitor their changes during storage.

AB To achieve a low methoxy-pectin nanocomposite film with maximum resistance to water and acceptable mechanical properties, the interactions of different glycerol concentrations and Ca2+ ions in both steps of cross-linking on the swelling degree (SD) and mechanical properties of prepared films were investigated using response surface methodology (RSM). Accordingly, quadratic second-order models were fitted to the SD and tensile strength responses; while the cubic model demonstrated a good relation between independent variables and elongation at break respectively. As a compromise between water resistance and mechanical properties of the prepared films, the use of 0.5% Ca2+, 0.75% Gly(1) and 7.5% Gly(2) is suggested as the optimum condition. Generally, crosslinking of pectin polymer with Ca2+ cations in the second step along with incorporation of nanocellulose into pectin film led to the formation of more flexible and completely water insoluble pectin nanocomposite film in comparison to the other polymers crosslinked with Ca2+ cations.

AB In this study, deep eutectic solvents (DESs) coupled with ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) were evaluated and optimized for the extraction of major flavonoids from common buckwheat sprouts. Initially, 18 different choline chloride (CC)-based DESs were evaluated as potential extraction solvents, and 80% CCTG (CC-based DES composed of triethylene glycol and 20 vol% water) extracted significantly higher (p < 0.05) amounts of flavonoids than other DESs studied. The extraction efficiency of 80% CCTG was even higher (p < 0.05) than that of methanol for the extraction of vitexin and quercetin-3-O-robinobioside. Procedure using 80% CCTG and UAE were optimized; an extraction temperature of 56 degrees C and extraction time of 40 min were considered optimal. The optimized extraction procedure was reliable and efficient for the extraction of major flavonoids from common buckwheat sprouts. In addition, flavonoids could be efficiently recovered from DES extracts with high recovery yields (> 97%) by using a C18 solid-phase extraction.

AB The antioxidant potential of the essential oils (EO) of 24 basil genotypes was assessed by 4 distinct in vitro evaluation methods. Different combinations of the major compounds found in the EO were also tested to identify those combinations responsible for the antioxidant activity of the volatile oils and verify the occurrence of synergism or antagonism between them. Results indicate that 9 EO exhibited promising antioxidant potential, with at least 52.68% of inhibition of the linoleic acid peroxidation at 10 mu L/mL and 76.34% of inhibition of the DPPH center dot radical at 1 mu L/mL. The major compound eugenol had the highest antioxidant activity. The antioxidant activity of these EO cannot be explained solely by the presence of the major compounds. Despite the influence of eugenol, the antioxidant activity is also related to the synergism between other minor compounds found in the EO. This fact confers a potent antioxidant activity to some basil EO.

AB To explore the protein surface properties treated by Pulsed Electric Field (PEF) with metal ions, we employed ovalbumin as the object and added three divalent metal ions (Ca2+, Cu2+ and Ba2+), respectively. The changes in surface hydrophobicity and surface tension were evaluated. Raman, FTIR, and fluorescence were used to record their structure variations. The results show that the surface hydrophobicity and surface tension of ovalbumin increased with the adding of metal ions. It was caused by the burial of some hydrophobic residues and variation of hydrophobic interaction between molecules, which was consistent with the results of spectra. With the combination of metal ions and PEF, the surface hydrophobicity and surface tension of ovalbumin showed an enhanced trend at first and then reduced with pulse time. These results demonstrate that metal ions and PEF have crucial influences on surface properties, that might afford a theoretical basis for the production and application of ovalbumin.

AB Covalent modification of flaxseed protein isolate by phenolic compounds including flaxseed polyphenols, ferulic acid, and hydroxytyrosol was studied under alkaline condition and in the presence of oxygen. The structure and function of the adducts was evaluated. The extent of covalent reaction and the physicochemical characteristics of flaxseed protein isolate-phenolic adducts were found to depend on the structure of the phenolic compounds. The decrease in free amino, thiol and tryptophan groups and increase in molecular weight were different. Crosslinks were found in flaxseed protein isolate-hydroxytyrosol adducts while ferulic acid and flaxseed polyphenols were unable to crosslink flaxseed proteins. The thermal stability and antioxidative capacity of the adducts were higher than those of flaxseed protein isolate. The structural conformation and hydrophobicity of the adducts were also found to depend on the nature of phenolic compounds. These adducts can be used in food formulations as natural antioxidants, emulsifiers and encapsulating shell materials.

AB Water activity (a(w)) and temperature are two pivotal environmental factors affecting Aspergillus flavus growth and aflatoxin production. Here, we found that AFB(1) production on polished rice can occur over a wider range of temperature x a(w) levels than that on paddies. For fungal growth on polished rice, the optimum conditions were a(w) 0.92-0.96 and 28-37 degrees C. The maximum amounts of AFB(1) on polished rice was observed at 33 degrees C and a(w) 0.96. Compared to 33 degrees C, all tested genes of A. flavus on polished rice were significantly up-regulated at 25 degrees C under a(w) 0.96. The late structural genes of pathway were significantly down-regulated at 37 degrees C under a(w) 0.96, although aflR and aflS and most of early structural genes were up-regulated. Compared to a(w) 0.96, most of pathway genes were significantly down-regulated at a(w) 0.90 and 0.99 under 33 degrees C, although two regulatory genes were up-regulated at a(w) 0.90.

AB Identification of volatiles in beer is important for consumers acceptability. In this study, triplicates of 24 beers from three types of fermentation (top/bottom/spontaneous) were analyzed using Gas Chromatograph with Mass-Selective Detector (GC-MSD) employing solid-phase microextraction (SPME). Principal components analysis was conducted for each type of fermentation. Multiple regression analysis, and an artificial neutral network model (ANN) were developed with the peak-areas of 10 volatiles to evaluate/predict aroma, flavor and overall liking. There were no hops-derived volatiles in bottom-fermentation beers, but they were present in top and spontaneous. Top and spontaneous had more volatiles than bottom-fermentation. 4-Ethyguaiacol and trans-beta-ionone were positive towards aroma, flavor and overall liking. Styrene had a negative effect on aroma, flavor and overall liking. An ANN model with high accuracy (R = 0.98) was obtained to predict aroma, flavor and overall liking. The use of SPME-GC-MSD is an effective method to detect volatiles in beers that contribute to acceptability.

ID RHEOLOGY
AB Fresh fruit beverages are a tasty way to follow the recommendations of World Health Organization. A study on the rheological behaviour of water-based and milk-based fruit beverages with emphasis on the temperature effect was made. The power law model adjusted data of apparent viscosity. The flow index of each beverage was practically constant with temperature variation. Then, one could discuss the variation with temperature of the consistency index. This parameter decreased around 40% in both cases in the temperature interval 5-30 degrees C. The stability of beverages against the sedimentation of the fruit pulp was clearly affected by the increase of temperature. Viscoelastic moduli were obtained in the linear region. Temperature dependency of both moduli was described in the interval 5-30 degrees C. The activation energy for linear viscoelastic flow was slightly higher than the activation energy for viscous flow. This result was interpreted as an indication of the strength of the microstructure-at-rest.

AB Synthetic food preservatives like sodium acetate (SA), sodium benzoate (SB), potassium sorbate (PS) and Butyl paraben (BP) have been widely used in food and pharmacy industries. One of the toxicological aspects of food additives is evaluation of their interaction with serum proteins such as albumin. These additives interaction with human serum albumin (HSA) can exert considerable effect on the absorption, distribution, metabolism and toxicity of chemical compounds. It should be noticed that the aforementioned food preservatives intake increase mainly in the presence of glucose may lead to complex formation of SA, SB, PS and BP with HSA and accelerate the development of variety disease such as cancer, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, brain damage, nausea and cardiac disease. Therefore, to understand the mechanisms of aforementioned food additives interaction and conformational changes of proteins, we aim to review various studies that investigated albumin interaction with these additives using several procedures.

Harvesting via an integrative holistic approach is recommended for optimal quality and functional compounds. Fruits at dark green (M1), light green (M2), colour break or pink (M3), red (M4), dark red (M5) stages were harvested in 2016 and 2017 seasons. The principal component analysis illustrated the colour value a* (redness), fruit weight, size (length and width), sugars (glucose and fructose), ascorbic acid content, cyanidin derivatives (cyanidin-3-O-pyranoside, cyanidin 3-O-beta-sambubioside, cyanidin-3-O-glucoside), naringenin 4'-O-glucoside, and antioxidant property (FRAP) were higher in the following order of maturity stages M5 > M4 > M3 > M2 > M1. Quercetin 3-O-rhamnosyl galactoside and glucoside were higher in green (h degrees higher) firm M1 to M3 stages. A strong correlation exists between fruit weight, size, a* value and cyanidin derivatives or naringenin 4'-O-glucoside or ascorbic acid content or antioxidant activity. Thus, the M4 and M5 stages of Natal plum can serve as functional food.

AB Clinical trials show an inverse relationship between the consumption of antioxidant-rich tree nuts and the development of chronic diseases. This study examined antioxidant efficacy of U.S. pecans using a modified cellular antioxidant activity (CAA) assay with comparisons to data from in vitro antioxidant assays (hydrophilic-oxygen radical absorbance capacity {H-ORAC(FL)} and ferric reducing antioxidant power {FRAP}). Crude phenolic extracts from both raw and roasted pecans were analyzed. In the CAA assay, pecan phenolics were taken up by human colorectal adenocarcinoma (Caco-2) cells and bestowed CAA, determined by monitoring the fluorescence of 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein. Phenolics (25-100 mu g/mL) demonstrated a reduction in fluorescence by 37-69% for raw and 26-68% for roasted pecans. The primary active phenolic constituents were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS) to be epi(catechin) dimers and trimers. These oligomeric procyanidins, ranging in size from 560 to 840 g/mol appear to be small enough for cellular uptake, showing pecans are an effective antioxidant in biological systems, regardless of roasting.

AB Broad bean flour is a valuable source of proteins and micronutrients and can efficiently balance the nutritional value of wheat flour. The aim of the study was to assess the impact of wheat flour substitution by native and germinated broad beans on the water related, thermal and rheological properties of the composite flours and sourdoughs. Regardless of the investigated flour, temperature increase resulted in significant decrease of water soluble index. Addition of broad bean to wheat flour affected the swelling power. Differential scanning calorimetry measurements on flours indicated two peaks at similar to 70 degrees C assigned to starch gelatinization, and similar to 100 degrees C attributed to amylose-lipids complexes disruption. The same thermal dependent events were highlighted through the rheometric temperature ramp test. Sourdoughs were further obtained out of the composite flours and dynamic rheometric analysis showed that fermentation improved flow resistance. Wheat substitution by broad bean flour increased sourdoughs consistency due to the higher protein content.

AB The effect of glucose oxidase (GOx) catalytic oxidation on the efficacy of gallic acid (GA) to modify the chemical structure and gelling behavior of myofibrillar protein (MP) was investigated. In contrast to non-oxidized MP samples where GA induced very little changes, GA (0, 6, 30, and 60 mu mol/g MP) under GOx treatment promoted sulfhydryl and amine loss (up to 58% and 49%, respectively). The attenuation of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence in the GA/GOx-treated MP corroborated the finding. The gelling capacity of MP, corresponding to disulfide and non-disulfide bond formation in protein aggregates, was markedly enhanced by 60 mu mol GA under GOx, up to 86% in gel storage modulus G' and 53% in gel strength. The GOx-aided GA modification of MP could be a potential ingredient strategy in meat processing to promote textural attributes of cooked products.

AB To verify the effect of protein phosphorylation on glycolysis and elucidate the regulatory mechanism from the perspective of enzyme activity, ovine muscle was treated with a kinase inhibitor, dimethyl sulfoxide, or a phosphatase inhibitor and the activities of glycogen phosphorylase, pyruvate kinase and phosphofructokinase were determined. The protein phosphorylation level was significantly different after incubation of muscle with kinase or phosphatase inhibitors. The pH value and lactate content revealed that a high phosphorylation level was the reason for the fast glycolysis. The glycogen phosphorylase, pyruvate kinase and phosphofructokinase activities were significantly higher in the phosphatase inhibitor group than in the other two groups (p < 0.05). Therefore, protein phosphorylation is involved in activating these three enzymes. In summary, protein phosphorylation plays a role in post-mortem glycolysis through the regulation of enzyme activity in ovine muscle.

DE Rennet; Chymosin; PDO cheese; IRMS; delta N-15
ID CARBON; NITROGEN
AB Chymosin is a protease that curdles the milk casein. Animal rennet was the first discovered source of chymosin and its use is mandatory for the production of PDO cheeses such as Parmigiano Reggiano and Grana Padano. Of the alternatives, fermentation-produced chymosin is the most competitive because it functions in a similar way, but is much cheaper. Analytical tools are necessary in order to distinguish the 2 types of chymosin and verify the compulsory use of animal rennet in the production of PDO cheeses.
   In this work, a method to analyse N-15/N-14 in chymosin after extraction was developed. The delta N-15 values of animal rennet range from 5.7 parts per thousand to 8 parts per thousand, whereas the delta N-15 values of fermentation-produced chymosin are significantly lower, ranging from - 5.3 parts per thousand to 2.2 parts per thousand. A threshold value of 5.7 parts per thousand was defined for authentic animal rennet.
   Addition of fermentation-produced chymosin to animal rennet, or its complete substitution, can be therefore detected.

AB Green coffee beans are rich in polyphenol chlorogenic acids (CGAs), which are decomposed to give caffeic acid (CFA) and quinic acid (QNA) upon roasting. CGA, CFA and QNA primarily confer the bitterness, astringency and acidity to the coffee brew. Aiming at the structural and thermodynamic insights into the beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) encapsulation of key compounds in coffee (CGA 1, CFA 2, and QNA 3), a systematic, comprehensive study using single-crystal X-ray diffraction and DFT calculation has been undertaken. Scrutinizing the X-ray-derived inclusion structures of 1-3 reveals that the CFA moiety plays a determinant role in complexation, in agreement with the DFT-derived relative thermodynamic stabilities. The guest molecules gain stability through O-H center dot center dot center dot O hydrogen bonding with beta-CD and are well shielded in the beta-CD wall. The three stable beta-CD inclusion complexes with coffee key compounds suggest the implications of CDs as encapsulating agents for improving bioactivities and masking bitter taste in foods.

AB Fish is a healthy food, rich in quality animal proteins, polyunsaturated fatty acids especially the (omega)-3 eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid and micronutrients. In addition, fish are more available and affordable than other sources of animal proteins in tropical countries. Aquaculture, which is one of the fastest growing food production sectors, could play a big role in eradicating hunger, malnutrition and nutrient-deprivation globally. However, nutritional information on fish is necessary for utilization of fish in achieving nutritional security and will be helpful in prioritizing species for aquaculture. In this context, we have studied the detailed nutritional composition of selected fishes from India and developed a database (http://www.cifri.res.in/nutrifishin/index.php) with the food data generated. This review explore the implications of such nutritional information in consumer guidance, dietary counselling, food-policy planning and prioritization of species for aquaculture to fight hunger, malnutrition and micronutrient deficiency; ultimately contributing to food and nutritional security.

AB Sulfur mustard (SM) is a destructive and harmful chemical agent for the eyes, skin and lungs that causes short-term and long-term lesions and was widely used in Iraq war against Iran (1980-1988). SM causes DNA damages, oxidative stress, and Inflammation. Considering the similarities between SM and COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) pathogens and limited available treatments, a novel therapeutic approach is not developed. Gene therapy is a novel therapeutic approach that uses genetic engineering science in treatment of most diseases including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In this review, attempts to presenting a comprehensive study of mustard lung and introducing the genes therapy involved in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and emphasizing the pathways and genes involved in the pathology and pathogenesis of sulfur Mustard. It seems that, given the high potential of gene therapy and the fact that this experimental technique is a candidate for the treatment of pulmonary diseases, further study of genes, vectors and gene transfer systems can draw a very positive perspective of gene therapy in near future.

AB Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are highly abundant in eukaryotic proteomes and involved in key biological and cellular processes. Although some resources of disordered protein predictions are available from animal and plant proteomes, those related to cereals are largely unknown. Here, we present an overview of IDPomes from Oryza sativa, Zea mays, Sorghum bicolor and Brachypodium distachyon. The work includes a comparative analysis with the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. The data show that the intrinsic disorder content increases with the proteome size. Gene Ontology analysis reveals that IDPs in the studied species are involved mainly in regulation of cellular and metabolic processes and responses to stimulus. Our findings strongly suggest that higher plants may use common cellular and regulatory mechanisms for adaptation to various environmental constraints.

AB In all eukaryotes, the response to heat stress (HS) is dependent on the activity of HS transcription factors (Hsfs). Plants contain a large number of Hsfs, however, only members of the HsfA1 subfamily are considered as master regulators of stress response and thermotolerance. In Solanum lycopersicum, among the four HsfA1 members, only HsfA1a has been proposed to possess a master regulator function. We performed a comparative analysis of HsfA1a, HsfA1b, HsfA1c and HsfA1e at different levels of regulation and function. HsfA1a is constitutively expressed under control and stress conditions, while the other members are induced in specific tissues and stages of HS response. Despite that all members are localized in the nucleus when expressed in protoplasts, only HsfA1a shows a wide range of basal activity on several HS-induced genes. In contrast, HsfA1b, HsfA1c, and HsfA1e show only high activity for specific subsets of genes. Domain swapping mutants between HsfA1a and HsfA1c revealed that the variation in that transcriptional transactivation activity is due to differences in the DNA binding domain (DBD). Specifically, we identified a conserved arginine (R107) residue in the turn of beta 3 and beta 4 sheet in the C-terminus of the DBD of HsfA1a that is highly conserved in plant HsfA1 proteins, but is replaced by leucine and cysteine in tomato HsfA1c and HsfA1e, respectively. Although not directly involved in DNA interaction, R107 contributes to DNA binding and consequently the activity of HsfA1a. Thus, we demonstrate that this variation in DBD in part explains the functional diversification of tomato HsfA1 members.

AB Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) potentially regulates tumorigenesis. LncRNA small nucleolar RNA host gene 1 (SNHG1) expression remains high in hepatocellular carcinoma cells; however, its biological mechanism in hepatocellular carcinoma remains unknown. In this study, SNHG1 expression in hepatocellular carcinoma cells was detected by qRT-PCR. Proliferative and migratory potentials of hepatocellular carcinoma cells were determined by CCK-8 and Transwell assay, respectively. Then, the nude mice model of xenograft was employed to verify the effect of SNHG1 on tumor formation in vivo. We identified the potential target of SNHG1 through bioinformatics and dual-luciferase reporter gene. Furthermore, Western blot and RIP assay was used for clarifying their interaction and functions in regulating the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. Our results indicated a high expression of SNHG1 in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Downregulation of SNHG1 inhibited proliferative and migratory potentials of hepatocellular carcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the expression of programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4) was positively regulated by SNHG1 through competing with miR-195-5p. These results indicated that SNHG1 participated in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma as a ceRNA to competitively bind to miR-195-5p and thus mediate PDCD4 expression.

AB The uniquely human alpha 7-nAChR gene (CHRFAM7A) is evolved from the fusion of two partially duplicated genes, FAM7 and alpha 7-nAChR gene (CHRNA7), and is inserted on same chromosome 15, 5' end of the CHRNA7 gene. Transcription of CHRFAM7A gene produces a 1256-bp open reading frame encoding dup-alpha 7-nAChR, where a 27aminoacid residues from FAM7 replaced the 146-aminoacid residues of the N-terminal extracellular ligand binding domain of alpha 7-nAChR. In vitro, dup-alpha 7-nAChR has been shown to form hetero-pentamer with alpha 7-nAChR and dominant-negatively regulates the channel functions of alpha 7-nAChR. However, the contribution of CHRFAM7A gene to the biology of alpha 7-nAChR in the brain in vivo remains largely a matter of conjecture. CHRFAM7A transgenic mouse was created and differentially expressed proteins were profiled from the whole brain using iTRAQ-2D-LC-MS/MS proteomic technology. Proteins with a fold change of >= 1.2 or <= 0.83 and p < 0.05 were considered to be significant. Bioinformatics analysis showed that over-expression of the CHRFAM7A gene significantly modulated the proteins commonly involved in the signaling pathways of alpha 7-nAChR-mediated neuropsychiatric disorders including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and alcoholism, suggesting that the CHRFAM7A gene contributes to the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders mostly likely through fine-tuning the functions of alpha 7-nAChR in the brain.

AB Calreticulin (CRT) is calcium binding protein of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) which performs plethora of functions besides it's role as molecular chaperone. Among the three different isoforms of this protein, CRT3 is most closely related to primitive CRT gene of higher plants. Based on their distinct structural and functional organisation, the plant CRTs have been known to contain three different domains: N, P and the C domain. The domain organisation and various biochemical characterstics of plant and animal CRTs are common with the exception of some differences. In plant calreticulin, the important N-glycosylation site(s) are replaced by the glycan chain(s) and several consensus sequences for in vitro phosphorylation by protein kinase CK2 (casein kinase-2), are also present unlike the animal calreticulin. Biotic and abiotic stresses play a significant role in bringing down the crop production. The role of various phytohormones in defense against fungal pathogens is well documented. CRT3 has been reported to play important role in protecting the plants against fungal and bacterial pathogens and in maintaining plant innate immunity. There is remarkable crosstalk between CRT mediated signalling and biotic, abiotic stress, and phytohormone mediated signalling pathways The role of CRT mediated pathway in mitigating biotic and abiotic stress can be further explored in plants so as to strategically modify it for development of stress tolerant plants.

AB Background: Recently, disagreements remain in increasing evidence about the potential value of circulating cellfree DNA (cfDNA) as a noninvasive diagnostic biomarker for ovarian cancer (OC). Here, this update meta-analysis was performed to further assess the diagnostic performance of circulating cfDNA in discriminating OC from non-cancerous individuals.
   Methods: We performed a systemic literature search of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, OVID, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and Wanfang databases to obtain 22 eligible articles including a total of 1125 patients and 1244 controls. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) and area under receiver operating characteristics curves (AUROC) of the included studies for cfDNA in diagnosing OC patients were used to estimate the diagnostic value. The clinical utility of cfDNA was evaluated by Fagan nomogram. Heterogeneity was explored utilizing subgroup analysis and meta-regression.
   Results: The pooled sensitivity and specificity were 73% and 90%, the DOR and AUROC were 25.29 and 0.90, respectively. Subgroup analyses and meta-regression, according to patients' region, study design, clinical stage, specimen types, detection indicators, simple size, publication year revealed there were no significant sources of heterogeneity. Additionally, subgroup analyses showed qualitative detection (methylation detection); TNM stage I-IV, publication year 2011-2018, serum-based cfDNA assays exhibited better diagnostic performance as com- pared to quantitative detection, TNM stage III-IV publication year 2002-2010; plasma-based cfDNA assays, and more participants and prospective studies manifested superior diagnostic accuracy. The result of sensitivity analysis indicated no study exclusively contributed to the heterogeneity and Deeks' funnel plot suggested no evidence of significant publication bias.
   Conclusions: Our meta-analysis found the qualitative detection (methylation); TNM stage I-IV, publication year 2011-2018 were related to more effective diagnostic accuracy for OC. However, serum-based cell-free DNA detection should be cautiously interpreted due to unclear factors. Hence, further large-scale longitudinal studies are required to validate the diagnostic potential of cell-free DNA. The present study provides to accrue knowledge of cell-free DNA levels for future researches.

AB Increasing studies have demonstrated the important roles of circular RNAs (circRNAs) in human malignancies. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms and functions of circRNAs in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are still not fully understood. In the present study, we evaluated circ_0021093 expression in 82 pairs of HCC tissues and 5 cell lines by qRT-PCR. The clinical implications of circ_0021093 were evaluated. In addition, the viability, apoptosis, migration and invasion capacities of different HCC cells were evaluated by gain-/loss-of-function experiments. Target prediction and dual-luciferase reporter experiments were performed to identify the molecular mechanisms of circ_0021093. Upregulation of circ_0021093 was found in HCC tumor samples and cells. Additionally, upregulated circ_0021093 was related to adverse clinical characteristics and an unfavorable prognosis. Furthermore, downregulated circ_0021093 attenuated cell growth, migration and invasion but increased cell apoptosis. By contrast, ectopically expressed circ_0021093 enhanced the abovementioned malignant biological behaviors. For mechanism exploration, circ_0021093 sponges of miR-766-3p were used in HCC cells. In addition, we found that metastasis-associated protein 3 (MTA3) was a direct target of miR-766-3p and that the oncogenic function of circ_0021093 was partly dependent on the miR-766-3p/MTA3 axis according to rescue assays. In conclusion, the circ_0021093/miR-766-3p/MTA3 regulatory axis may be an effective therapeutic target for HCC.

AB Background: Progressive cardiac conduction defect (PCCD), also known as Lenegre-Lev disease, is one of the most common heart conduction abnormalities. Previous studies have screened for known mutation sites that cause heart block in a 68-person family with a history of PCCD, revealed no mutations.
   Objective: To screen pathogenic genes of the PCCD family and to study the function of the gene mutations related to heart block diseases.
   Methods: Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed on two PCCD patients and one non-PCCD family member to find the related pathogenic gene. After family co-segregation and preliminary functional analysis, we identified the mutant gene CLCA2. To study the function of this gene, we constructed mutant-gene mice using CRISPR-Cas9 technology, and electrocardiogram monitoring was performed after genotype verification.
   Results: The CLCA2 c.G1725T mutation was identified and co-segregated with the phenotype. The analysis showed that the CLCA2 c.G1725T mutation is harmful and mainly affects protein glycosylation. Immunofluorescence staining revealed that CLCA2 was highly expressed in the sinoatrial node (SAN) tissues. Electrocardiogram monitoring of the mice revealed that CLCA2 point mutations induced mild conduction block and ectopic pacemakers.
   Conclusion: Our findings indicate that a novel heterozygous missense mutation c.G1725T of the CLCA2 gene may be associated with heart block disease and the mutation in this gene may lead to sinus node lesions and conduction blocking.

AB Among cancers, lung cancer is the most morbidity and mortality disease that is remaining the fatalist. Generally, there are multiple treatment procedures for lung cancer, such as surgery, immunotherapy, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. There is, therefore, an urgent need for more specified and efficient methods for treatment of lung cancer such as RNAi, which in combination with traditional therapies could silence genes that are involved in the drug resistance. These genes may either be motivators of apoptosis inhibition, EMT and DNA repair system promoters or a member of intracellular signaling pathways, such as JAK/STAT, RAS/RAF/MEK, PI3K/AKT, NICD, B-catenin/TCF/LEF and their stimulator receptors including IGFR, EGFR, FGFR, VEGFR, CXCR4, MET, INTEGRINS, NOTCH1 and FRIZZLED, so could be considered as appropriate targets. In current review, the results of multiple studies which have employed drug application after one specific gene silencing or more than one gene from distinct pathways also simultaneous drug and RNAi usage in vitro and in vivo in lung cancer were summarized.

AB Based on Akt1 and Jak1 key roles in apoptosis and proliferation of many cancers, the aim of this study was to find a new gene therapy strategy by silencing of these main anti-apoptotic genes for HNSCC treatment. Cancerous HN5 and normal HUVEC cell lines were treated with Akt1 and Jak1 siRNAs alone or with each other combined with/without cisplatin. The MTS, flow cytometry, 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining, real-time PCR and ELISA methods were utilized in this study. The highest percentage of apoptosis was observed in the treatment of Jak1 siRNA/cisplatin group in cancerous HN5 cells (96.5%) where this treatment showed 12.84% apoptosis in normal HUVEC cell line. Cell viability reduced significantly to 64.57% after treatment with Akt1 siRNA in HN5 treated group. Knocking down Akt1 and Jak1 genes using siRNAs could increase levels of apoptosis and reduce proliferation rate in HNSCC indicating the powerful effects of these genes siRNAs with or without chemotherapeutic agents in HNSCC treatment. In conclusion, the combination of siRNA-mediated gene-silencing strategy can be considered as a valuable and safe approach for sensitizing cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents thus proposed further studies regarding this issue to approve some siRNA based therapeutics for using in clinic.

AB Aim: MYC deregulation contributes to breast cancer development and progression. Deregulated expression levels of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) have been demonstrated to be critical players in development and/or maintenance of breast cancer. In this study we aimed to evaluate lncRNA expressions depending on MYC overexpression and knockdown in breast cancer cells.
   Materials and methods: Cells were infected with lentiviral vectors by either knockdown or overexpression of c-MYC. LncRNA cDNA was transcribed from total RNA samples and lncRNAs were evaluated by qRT-PCR.
   Results: Our results indicated that some of the lncRNAs having tumor suppressor (GASS, MEG3, lincRNA-p21) and oncogenic roles (HOTAIR) are regulated by c-MYC.
   Conclusion: We observed that c-MYC regulates lncRNAs that have important roles on proliferation, cell cycle and etc. Further studies will give us a light to identify molecular mechanisms related to MYC-lncRNA regulatory pathways in breast cancer.

AB Influenza A virus is a leading cause of death worldwide. Viruses of the H5 subtype have the potential to induce high mortality, and no vaccines are currently available to protect against H5 influenza viruses in the event of an outbreak. Experimental vaccination with one Glade 2 virus does not protect against other subclades. The computationally optimized broadly reactive (COBRA) methodology was previously used to generate a H5 hemagglutinin (HA) antigen (COBRA2) that elicited increased serological breadth against multiple clade 2 H5N1 influenza viruses. In this report, we structurally and antigenically characterized the COBRA2 HA antigen. We examined the biochemical characteristics of the COBRA2 protein and determined the protein is correctly cleaved, properly folded into a trimeric structure, and antigenically correct by probing with HA head- and stem-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). We further probed the antigenicity by examining binding of a panel of H5 mouse mAbs to the COBRA2 antigen, as well as several other HA antigens. We determined the X-ray crystal structure of the COBRA2 HA antigen to 2.8 angstrom and the protein was observed to be in the expected trimeric form. The COBRA2 HA was structurally similar to the naturally occurring H5 HA antigens and suggests the protein folds similar to known HA structures. Overall, our data allow us to formulate a hypothesis on the mechanism of increased breadth due to vaccination with the COBRA2 HA antigen, which is that the protein incorporates antigenic sites from numerous HA antigens, and elicits mAbs with limited breadth, but with diversity in targeted antigenic sites.

AB Background: Around 70% of cervical cancers are caused by Types 16 and 18 of human papillomavirus (HPV). Vaccines against HPV have been shown to be safe and effective in preventing HPV and cervical cancer.
   Objective: To explore the facilitators and barriers of HPV vaccination in young females aged 18-26 years in Singapore, and to describe their recommended strategies to improve the uptake of HPV vaccination.
   Design: Qualitative, descriptive design guided by the socio-ecological model.
   Participants: Young women studying in National University of Singapore (NUS), aged 18-26 (N = 40). Purposive sampling was used to recruit participants from various socio-economic levels and faculties, both vaccinated against HPV and unvaccinated.
   Methods: In-depth interviews (IDIs) and focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted with the participants. IDIs and FGDs were transcribed and coded using NVIVO software. Thematic data analysis was performed using an inductive approach.
   Results: Barriers to HPV vaccination included lack of awareness, lack of perceived risk for cervical cancer, cost, lack of parental support, inconvenience of getting the vaccination, stigma associated with connection with sexual activity, and concern regarding safety. Facilitators include parental encouragement, protection of one's health, lack of logistical barriers, and perceived safety and efficacy of the vaccine. Participants recommended increasing awareness of HPV vaccination and cervical cancer, reducing cost of vaccination and making the vaccine compulsory to increase vaccine uptake.
   Conclusion: Barriers and facilitators exist at different levels to influence vaccine uptake. Public education on cervical cancer and the vaccine should be stepped up to increase public awareness. A school-based national vaccination programme was proposed by the target group to increase the rate of uptake of HPV vaccination in Singapore. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   Supplemental immunization activities
ID PERFORMANCE; STRATEGIES; IMPACT
AB Background: Measles causes significant childhood morbidity in Nigeria. Routine immunization (RI) coverage is around 40% country-wide, with very high levels of spatial heterogeneity (3-86%), with supplemental immunization activities (SIAs) at 2-year or 3-year intervals. We investigated cost savings and burden reduction that could be achieved by adjusting the inter-campaign interval by region.
   Methods: We modeled 81 scenarios; permuting SIA calendars of every one, two, or three years in each of four regions of Nigeria (North-west, North-central, North-east, and South). We used an agent-based disease transmission model to estimate the number of measles cases and ingredients-based cost models to estimate RI and SIA costs for each scenario over a 10 year period.
   Results: Decreasing SIAs to every three years in the North-central and South (regions of above national average RI coverage) while increasing to every year in either the North-east or North-west (regions of below national-average RI coverage) would avert measles cases (0.4 or 1.4 million, respectively), and save vaccination costs (save $19.4 or $5.4 million, respectively), compared to a base-case of national SIAs every two years. Decreasing SIA frequency to every three years in the South while increasing to every year in the just the North-west, or in all Northern regions would prevent more cases (2.1 or 5.0 million, respectively), but would increase vaccination costs (add $3.5 million or $34.6 million, respectively), for $1.65 or $6.99 per case averted, respectively.
   Conclusions: Our modeling shows how increasing SIA frequency in Northern regions, where RI is low and birth rates are high, while decreasing frequency in the South of Nigeria would reduce the number of measles cases with relatively little or no increase in vaccination costs. A national vaccination strategy that incorporates regional SIA targeting in contexts with a high level of sub-national variation would lead to improved health outcomes and/or lower costs.

AB Objective: Two rotavirus vaccines (RV1 and RV5) were included in the publicly funded National Immunisation Program in Australia from July 2007. The programme in Western Australia initially provided RV1 (at ages 2 and 4 months) and then switched to RV5 (at ages 2,4 and 6 months) from July 2009. This retrospective case-control study was conducted to assess the effectiveness of rotavirus vaccine against laboratory confirmed and notified cases of rotavirus infection among children aged <5 years.
   Methods: Case-subjects were identified as vaccine-eligible children (born from 1 May 2007) who were notified as having rotavirus infection during the period 2009-2011. The control group was vaccine eligible children notified as having Campylobacter or Salmonella infection during the same period. Individual rotavirus immunisation status was ascertained from a population-based immunisation register. Full-dose and partial-dose vaccine effectiveness (VE) were calculated for both vaccines using the adjusted odds ratio (OR) of vaccination for cases versus controls (VE = (1 - OR)*100%).
   Results: Overall, 282 cases and 883 controls were included. The adjusted VE for a full course of either rotavirus vaccine was 72% (95% CI: 56-82) and 71% (95% CI: 50-84) for partial vaccination (one dose of RV1 or one/two doses of RV5). The VE for a complete 3-dose course of RV5 was 82% (95% CI: 59-92) and for a full 2-dose course of RV1 was 73% (95% CI: 55-83).
   Conclusions: RV1 and RV5 were both effective in preventing laboratory confirmed and notified rotavirus infections among children aged <5 years. Even incomplete courses of vaccination conferred good protection. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To evaluate predictors of vaccination among women who received tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis vaccination (Tdap), influenza vaccination, and Tdap and influenza vaccinations.
   Study Design: In a retrospective cohort study of all full-term (>= 37 weeks gestation) deliveries between July 1, 2016 and June 30, 2018 at a single, safety-net institution, we used multinomial logistic regression models to compare predictors of vaccination among women who received Tdap only, influenza only, and both Tdap and influenza vaccines.
   Results: Among 3132 full-term deliveries, women were primarily non-Hispanic black (67.5%), between the ages of 21-34 (65.3%), and multiparous (76.0%). The rates of only influenza or Tdap vaccination were 10.3% and 21.6%, respectively; 43.3% of women received both vaccines, and 24.9% of women did not receive either vaccine. In the adjusted models, Hispanic ethnicity was positively associated with receipt of all types of vaccination and non-Spanish language interpreter use was positively associated with receipt of Tdap vaccination and Tdap and influenza vaccination. A parity of greater than three and inadequate and unknown prenatal care adequacy were negative predictors of all types of vaccination. Pre-existing hypertension was negatively associated with Tdap vaccination, and HIV-positive status was negatively associated with influenza vaccination and Tdap and influenza vaccination.
   Conclusion: Compared to the national rate of both Tdap and influenza vaccination (32.8%), a higher proportion of women received both vaccines in our study population. Vaccine uptake may be affected by race/ethnicity, use of interpreter services, parity, pre-existing comorbidities, and prenatal care adequacy. The lower rate of influenza vaccination compared to Tdap vaccination suggests that other factors, such as vaccine hesitancy and mistrust, may be differentially impacting influenza vaccination uptake in our predominantly minority population. Future provider and public health approaches to vaccine promotion should incorporate culturally appropriate strategies that address vaccine-related beliefs and misconceptions. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Vaccination provides protection against infection by inducing VNAs mainly against RABV surface GP. The measurement of VNAs to RABV is commonly used to assess the level of immunity in humans and animals after vaccination. A VNA titer of >= 0.5 IU/mL of sera indicates adequate response to vaccination. Here, we report the development and validation of a RABV GP serology ELISA kit for semi-quantitative measurement of VNA titers in sera of vaccinated human subjects.
   Methods: Using a recombinant RABV GP expressed in mammalian cells as the capture antigen, the ELISA method was established using HuMAb NM57 reference initially and HRIG reference subsequently. The limit of detection (LOD), linear range, reproducibility, and precision of the method were examined. Specificity and sensitivity were established to assess the diagnostic accuracy.
   Results: RABV GP for ELISA plate coating and optimal dilution of human serum sample was 1 mu g/mL and 1:20, respectively. Multiple assays were carried out by different technicians at different laboratories for assay standardization. Using the HRIG reference, the LOD was found to be 0.02-0.06 IU/mL and the linear range was 0.2-10.0 IU/mL. The inter-assay CVs were in the range of 6.60-10.79%, indicating the reproducibility. None of the 12 known negative human sera, tested positive by ELISA, highlighting the specificity. A total of 415 unknown positive human sera were double-blind tested by the RFFIT and ELISA. The VNA titer cut-off value of ELISA was set at 1.5 IU/mL to ensure no false-positive. The diagnostic specificity and sensitivity were 100% and 91.1%, respectively.
   Conclusions: The validation data characterize this ELISA as a suitable method for semi-quantitative measurement of VNA titers in human serum samples to assess vaccination status. The ELISA kit can offer simplicity, speed, low cost and high throughput, making it a practical tool for monitoring the immune response following vaccination. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Bluetongue (BT) is a hemorrhagic non-contagious, biting midge-transmitted disease of wild and domestic ruminants that is caused by bluetongue virus (BTV). Annual vaccination plays a pivotal role in BT disease control in endemic regions. Due to safety concerns of the current BTV multivalent live attenuated vaccine (LAV), a safe efficacious new generation subunit vaccine such as a plant-produced BT virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine is imperative. Previously, homogenous BTV serotype 8 (BTV-8) VLPs were successfully produced in Nicotiana benthamiana plants and provided protective immunity in sheep. In this study, combinations of BTV capsid proteins from more than one serotype were expressed and assembled to form chimaeric BTV-3 and BTV-4 VLPs in N. benthamiana plants. The assembled homogenous BTV-8, as well as chimaeric BTV-3 and chimaeric BTV-4 VLP serotypes, were confirmed by SDS-PAGE, Transmission Electron microscopy (TEM) and protein confirmation using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) based peptide sequencing. As VP2 is the major determinant eliciting protective immunity, the percentage coverage and number of unique VP2 peptides detected in assembled chimaeric BT VLP5 were used as a guide to assemble the most appropriate chimaeric combinations. Both plant-produced chimaeric BTV-3 and BTV-4 VLPs were able to induce long-lasting serotype-specific neutralizing antibodies equivalent to the monovalent LAV controls. Antibody levels remained high to the end of the trial. Combinations of homogenous and chimaeric BT VLPs have great potential as a safe, effective multivalent vaccine with the ability to distinguish between vaccinated and infected individuals (DIVA) due to the absence of non-structural proteins.

AB Human Q fever is recognized as a worldwide public health problem. It often occurs by inhalation of airborne aerosols contaminated with Coxiella burnetii, a gram-negative intracellular bacterium, mainly from domestic livestock. In this study, we analyzed the possibility to establish mucosal and systemic immunity against C burnetii infection using a pulmonary delivery of chloroform-methanol residue of C burnetii (CMR) vaccine. Mice were immunized by the intratracheal inoculation of CMR (IT-CMR) or the subcutaneous injection of CMR (SC-CMR), and the immunized mice were challenged with C. burnetii by the intratracheal route. The levels of IFN-gamma, IL-12p70, IL-5, and IL-4 in the IT-CMR group in splenic T cells stimulated ex vivo were significantly higher than in the SC-CMR group. Significantly elevated sIgA to C burnetii was detected in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of mice immunized by IT-CMR but not by SC-CMR, which might have contributed to the significant reduction in C burnetii load and pathological lesions in the lungs of the mice after the challenge of C burnetii. These results suggest that compared with SC-CMR in mice, IT-CMR was more efficient to elicit cellular and lung mucosal immune responses against aerosol infection of C burnetii. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Prostate Cancer specific immunotherapy in combination with immune stimulating adjuvants may serve as a viable strategy for facilitating tumor regression and preventing recurrence. In this study, an oral microparticulate vaccine encapsulating tumor associated antigens (TAA) extracted from a murine prostate cancer cell line, TRAMP-C2, was formulated with the help of a spray dryer. Microparticles were characterized in vitro to determine their physicochemical properties and antigenicity. Formulated microparticles had an average size of 4.92 +/- 0.5 mu m with a zeta potential of 7.92 +/- 1.2 mV. In order to test our formulation for its ability to demonstrate adequate antigen presentation and co-stimulation, microparticles were tested in vitro on murine dendritic cells. In vitro biological characterization demonstrated the activation of specific immune system markers such as CD80/86, CD40, MHC-I and MHC-II. Following in vitro characterization, in vivo anti-tumor efficacy of the oral microparticulate vaccine was evaluated in C57BL/6 male mice. Combination therapy of vaccine microparticles with cyclophosphamide and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) demonstrated a five-fold reduction in tumor volume as compared to non-vaccinated mice. At the cellular level, cyclophosphamide and GMCSF augmented the vaccine response as indicated by the reduced tumor volume and significant elevation of cytotoxic T-cell (CTL) CD8+ and (T-helper) CD4+ T-cells compared to mice receiving vaccine microparticles alone. Furthermore, our studies indicate a significant reduction in T-regulatory cells (T-regs) in mice receiving vaccine along with GM-CSF and cyclophosphamide, one of the immune escape mechanisms linked to tumor growth and progression. Thus, oral microparticulate vaccines have the potential to trigger a robust anti-tumor cellular response, and in combination with clinically relevant agents, significantly resist tumor growth and progression.

AB Measles vaccination is a cost-effective way to prevent infection and reduce mortality and morbidity. However, in countries with fragile routine immunization infrastructure, coverage rates are still low and supplementary immunization campaigns (SIAs) are used to reach previously unvaccinated children. During campaigns, vaccine is generally administered to every child, regardless of their vaccination status and as a result, there is the possibility that a child that is already immune to measles (i.e. who has had 2 + vaccinations) would receive an unnecessary dose, resulting in excess cost. Selective vaccination has been proposed as one solution to this; children who were able to provide documentation of previous vaccination would not be vaccinated repeatedly. While this would result in reduced vaccine and supply cost, it would also require additional staff time and increased social mobilization investment, potentially outweighing the benefits. We utilize Monte Carlo simulation to assess under what conditions a selective vaccination policy would indeed result in net savings. We demonstrate that cost savings are possible in contexts with a high joint probability of an individual child having both 2+ previous measles doses and also an available record. We also find that the magnitude of net cost savings is highly dependent on whether a country is using measles-only or measles-rubella vaccine and on the required skill set of the individual who would review the previous vaccination records.

AB Loss of airway microbial diversity is associated with non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) infection and increased risk of exacerbation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We assessed the safety and immunogenicity of an investigational vaccine containing NTHi antigens, recombinant protein D (PD) and combined protein E and Pilin A (PE-PilA), and AS01 adjuvant in adults with moderate/-severe COPD and prior exacerbations.
   In this phase 2, observer-blind, controlled trial (NCT02075541), 145 COPD patients aged 40-80 years randomly (1:1) received two doses of NTHi vaccine or placebo 60 days apart, on top of standard care.
   Reactogenicity in the 7-day post-vaccination period was higher following NTHi vaccine than placebo. Most solicited adverse events (AEs) were mild/moderate. At least one unsolicited AE was reported during the 30-day post-vaccination period by 54.8% of NTHi vaccine and 51.4% of placebo recipients. One serious AE (placebo group) was assessed by the investigator as vaccine-related. Anti-PD, anti-PE and anti-PiIA geometric mean antibody concentrations increased up to 30 days after each NTHi vaccine dose, waned thereafter, but remained higher than baseline (non-overlapping confidence intervals) up to 13 months post-dose 2. The frequency of specific CD4(+) T cells increased following two doses of NTHi vaccine and remained higher than baseline. Exploratory analysis showed a statistically non-significant lower yearly rate of moderate/severe exacerbations in the NTHi vaccine group than following placebo (1.49 versus 1.73) in the one-year period post-dose 2, with estimated vaccine efficacy of 13.3% (95% confidence interval -24.2 to 39.5; p = 0.44).
   The NTHi vaccine had an acceptable safety and reactogenicity profile and good immunogenicity in adults with COPD. (C) 2019 GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals S.A. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of severe respiratory disease in the very young, elderly, and immunocompromised for which there is no vaccine. The surface exposed RSV fusion (F) glycoprotein is required for membrane fusion and infection and is a desirable vaccine candidate. RSV F glycoprotein structure is dynamic and undergoes significant rearrangements during virus assembly, fusion, and infection. We have previously described an RSV fusion-inactive prefusogenic F with a mutation of one of two furin cleavage sites resulting in the p27 region on the N-terminus of F1 with a truncated fusion peptide covalently linked to F2. A processing intermediate RSV prefusogenic F has been reported in infected cells, purified F, budded virus, and elicited a strong immune response against p27 in RSV infected young children. In this report, we demonstrate that prefusogenic F, when expressed on the cell surface of Sf9 insect and human 293T cells, binds monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that target prefusion-specific antigenic sites empty set and VIII, and mAbs targeting epitopes common to pre- and postfusion F sites II and IV. Purified prefusogenic F bound prefusion F specific mAbs to antigenic sites empty set and VIII and mAbs targeting pre- and post fusion sites 11, IV, and p27. Mice immunized with prefusogenic F antigen produced significantly higher levels of anti-F IgG and RSV neutralizing antibodies than prefusion or postfusion F antigens and induced antibodies competitive with mAbs to sites empty set, VIII, II, and IV. RSV prefusogenic F neutralization antibody responses were enhanced with aluminum phosphate adjuvant and significantly higher than prefusion F. Prefusogenic F vaccine protected cotton rats against upper and lower respiratory tract infection by RSV/A. For the first time, we present the structure, antigenic profile, immunogenicity, and protective efficacy of RSV prefusogenic F nanoparticle vaccine. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Based on archival materials, collected literature and archival articles analysing the clinical course of the disease, the article presents the medical and social course of one of the recent epidemics of smallpox in Europe, which took place in Wroclaw in 1963. During the epidemic, 99 people fell ill and seven of them died. The authors describe how a mass vaccination campaign was organised in the city and the entire surrounding region. This historical study shows not only the course of the epidemic itself, but also the ways to prevent and deal with infectious diseases and the organisation of vaccinations in communist Poland. The authors also discuss the issue of the relationship between the vaccination period and the course of smallpox in patients and show the scale of post-vaccination complications in the situation of mass vaccination against smallpox. Although the article refers to historical events, it draws attention to the topicality of challenges posed by the variola virus. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Developing Countries Vaccine Manufacturers Network (DCVMN) convened vaccine manufacturing experts and leaders from local and global public health organizations for its 19th Annual General Meeting. Lectures and panel discussions centered on international cooperation for better access to vaccines, and partnerships in areas ranging from vaccine research and process development, to clinical studies, regulatory, supply chain and emergency preparedness and response.
   Global vaccine market trends and changes that will impact vaccine financing and procurement methods were discussed as well as capital sources, including funding, for the development of new or improved vaccines.
   DCVMN members presented their progress in developing novel Hexavalent, Meningitis, Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine, Shigella, Mumps, Rotavirus, Yellow Fever, Polio, Hepatitis E and Dengue vaccines, and a novel monoclonal antibody cocktail for post-bite prophylaxis against rabies infections.
   Access to and availability of vaccines is enhanced through sharing of best practices for vaccine quality control, reducing redundant testing and promoting development of harmonized common standards. Eligible stakeholders were encouraged to join the WHO-National Control Laboratory Network for Biologicals which serves as a platform for collaboration and technical exchange in this area.
   Increasing regulatory convergence at the regional and global levels through mechanisms such as joint dossier review and the WHO Collaborative Registration Procedure can help to accelerate vaccine access globally. Additionally, four proposals for streamlining procedures and alignment of dossiers were discussed.
   Successful partnerships between a broad range of stakeholders, including international organizations, manufacturers, academic research institutes and regulators have provided support for, and in some cases accelerated, vaccine innovation, clinical trials and registration, WHO prequalification, vaccine introduction and access. Strong partnerships, based on experience and trust, help leverage opportunities and are critically important to advancing the shared goal of providing quality vaccines for all people.

AB Ducks play a key role in the maintenance and spread of avian influenza viruses (AIVs) in nature, and control of AIVs in ducks has important implications for AIV eradication from poultry. We previously constructed a recombinant duck enteritis virus (DEV), rDEVus78HA, that expresses the HA gene of an H5N1 AIV and showed that rDEVus78HA immunization provides complete protection against both DEV and H5N1 AIV challenge in specific-pathogen-free ducks. In this study, we performed a 60-week clinical trial and found that this rDEVus78HA vaccine can function as a bivalent vaccine in farmed ducks against lethal challenge with DEV and H5N1 virus. Moreover, we found that rDEVus78HA-vaccinated ducks were efficiently protected against challenges with recently isolated heterologous H5N6 and H5N8 viruses. Our results demonstrate that rDEVus78HA could be extremely valuable for the control of DEV and H5 AlVs in ducks. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Rubella infection is a vaccine preventable disease. Maternal infection during pregnancy may lead to congenital infection and severe foetal malformations. Thanks to antiretroviral therapy, perinatally HIV-infected women have better prognosis and are now experiencing pregnancy. We evaluated the rate of rubella seronegativity in a cohort of HIV perinatally-infected women of childbearing age. A high rate of seronegativity was found in this group as compared to age-matched non-perinatally infected HIV infected women (34.5% vs 6.90%, p < 0.01). MMR administration before rubella testing was identified in 75.8% of perinatally-infected women (22/29) with a mean of 2 doses (range: 1-3 doses). HIV perinatally-infected women of childbearing age should be screened repeatedly for rubella immunity. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Limited research has explored reasons for low up-to-date coverage with meningococcal vaccine (UTD MenACWY) among adolescents at age 17 years. This analysis used National Immunization Survey-Teen data from 2017 to examine patterns of UTD MenACWY coverage. Correlates of higher UTD MenACWY coverage included black race and Hispanic ethnicity, residing in Northeast census region, recent health care visits, and receipt of recommendation for HPV vaccine. Median UTD MenACWY coverage was significantly higher in states with 1 and 2-dose requirements for school entry compared to no requirement; exemption policies were not associated. Approximately 13% of adolescents had a missed opportunity for UTD MenACWY. Future research should examine barriers to coverage at the patient, parent, provider and structural (clinic, social, policy) levels so that programs and interventions can be designed and implemented to increase coverage.

AB Vaccines prevent an estimated 2.5 million deaths worldwide each year and are amongst the most cost-effective preventive measures against infectious diseases. Despite the effectiveness and availability of vaccines in many parts of the world, vaccination rates and service uptake remains suboptimal among both healthcare providers and the public. Pharmacists as established advocates, educators as well as qualified providers of vaccinations have a significant role to play in promoting and supporting the uptake of vaccination. Challenges and barriers to pharmacist vaccination are multifactorial, which needs effective strategies to address. Overcoming these barriers will increase the role of pharmacists as vaccinators that ultimately increases public access to vaccination and accurate and reliable information about vaccines.

AB Wildebeest-associated malignant catarrhal fever (WA-MCF), a fatal disease of cattle caused by alcelaphine herpesvirus 1 (AIHV-1), is one of the most important seasonal diseases of cattle in wildebeest endemic areas, with annual incidence reaching 10%. Here we report efficacy of over 80% for a vaccine based on the attenuated AIHV-1 C500 strain, in preventing fatal WA-MCF in cattle exposed to natural wildebeest challenge. The study was conducted at Kapiti Plains Ranch Ltd, south-east of Nairobi, Kenya. In 2016, 146 cattle were selected for a randomised placebo-controlled trial. Cattle were stratified according to breed and age and randomly assigned to groups given vaccine or culture medium mixed with Emulsigee (R). Cattle received prime and boost inoculations one month apart and few adverse reactions (n = 4) were observed. Indirect ELISA demonstrated that all cattle in the vaccine group developed a serological response to AIHV-1. The study herd was grazed with wildebeest from one month after booster vaccination. Three cattle, two that received vaccine and one control, succumbed to conditions unrelated to WA-MCF before the study ended. Twenty-five cattle succumbed to WA-MCF; four of the remaining 71 cattle in the vaccine group (5.6%) and 21 of the remaining 72 control cattle (29.2%; chi(2) =13.6, df = 1, p < 0.001). All of the WA-MCF affected cattle were confirmed by PCR to be infected with AlHV-1 and in 23 cases exhibited histopathology typical of WA-MCF. Vaccine efficacy was determined to be 80.6% (95% CI 46.5-93.0%). Hence, the AlHV-1 C500 vaccine is a safe and potentially effective novel method for controlling WA-MCF in cattle. The implementation of this vaccine may have significant impacts on marginalised cattle keeping communities. (C) 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB L-HBsAg is a third-generation hepatitis vaccine capable of inducing antibodies in non-responders and thus providing potentially therapeutic treatment. In this study, L-HBsAg was administered using micro needles (MN) without an adjuvant to induce intradermal (ID) immunization, and the efficacy of ID immunization was compared with that of intramuscular (IM) immunization that uses a conventional formulation with an adjuvant of aluminum hydroxide (L-HBsAg-AL-IM).
   The L-HBsAg was dip-coated onto 800-mu m-long microneedles made of polylactic acid (PLA). Delivery efficiency and administration time were determined through in vitro experiments using porcine skin. The denaturation of the formulation against sterilization by gamma rays was observed. A storage test and a freeze-thaw cycle test of the microneedles with trehalose as a stabilizer (L-HBsAg-MN-Tre) were observed. An antibody titer of L-HBsAg-MN-Tre was compared with that of the conventional IM immunization of the L-HBsAg solution with aluminum hydroxide (L-HBsAg-AL-IM).
   The formulation containing L-HBsAg was located on the upper third of the microneedle tips. The formulation on the MN was dissolved and delivered within 30 min of insertion into porcine skin in vitro. Trehalose was selected as a stabilizer, and the stabilizing effect increased with the increase of trehalose content in the solidified formulation. L-HBsAg-MN with 15% of trehalose was stable for 7 days at 40 degrees C and showed increased stability compared to the conventional liquid formulations. L-HBsAg-MN-Tre showed improved stability during the freeze-thaw cycle. The antibody titer of L-HBsAg-MN-Tre at 28 days was higher than that of L-HBsAg-AL-IM.
   ID administration of L-HBsAg-MN-Tre showed better efficacy and improved thermal and freeze thaw stability compared to L-HBsAg-AL-IM. Therefore, L-HBsAg-MN-Tre administration showed the possibility of ID delivery of L-HBsAg without the use of an adjuvant for the efficacy, convenience, and safety of pediatric vaccination.

AB Type B Coxsackieviruses (CVBs) belong to the enterovirus genus, and they cause both acute and chronic diseases in humans. CVB infections usually lead to flu-like symptoms but can also result in more serious diseases such as myocarditis, aseptic meningitis and life-threatening multi-organ infections in young infants. Thus, CVBs have long been considered as important targets of future vaccines.
   We have previously observed CVB1 capsid disintegration and virus concentration decrease with 12-day long formalin inactivation protocol. Here a scalable ion exchange chromatography purification method was developed, and purified CVB1 was inactivated with UV-C or formalin. Virus morphology and concentration remained unchanged, when the UV (2 min) or formalin (5 days) inactivation were performed in the presence of tween80 detergent. The concentration of the native and UV inactivated CVB1 remained constant at 4 degrees C during a six months stability study, whereas the concentration of the formalin inactivated vaccine decreased 29% during this time. UV treatment decreased, whereas formalin treatment increased the thermal stability of the capsid.
   The formalin inactivated CVB1 vaccine was more immunogenic than the UV inactivated vaccine; the protective neutralizing antibody levels were higher in mice immunized with formalin inactivated vaccine. High levels of CVB1 neutralizing antibodies as well as IgG1 antibodies were detected in mice that were protected against viremia induced by experimental CVB1 infection.
   In conclusion, this study describes a scalable ion exchange chromatography purification method and optimized 5-day long formalin inactivation method that preserves CVB1 capsid structure and immunogenicity. Formalin treatment stabilizes the virus particle at elevated temperatures, and the formalin inactivated vaccine induces high levels of serum IgG1 antibodies (Th2 type response) and protective levels of neutralizing antibodies. Formalin inactivated CVB vaccines are promising candidates for human clinical trials. (C) 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Infection with hepatitis E virus (HEV) has raised serious public health concerns worldwide. In this study, a nanogel-based vaccine encapsulating the capsid protein of rabbit HEV was developed and its protective efficacy was compared with a subunit vaccine. A total of 23 rabbits were divided into 5 groups: (1) negative control (n = 4), (2) positive control (n = 4), (3) nanogel control (n = 5), (4) nanogel vaccine (n = 5), and (5) subunit vaccine (n = 5). Rabbits were vaccinated two times, at weeks 0 and 1, with nanogel and subunit vaccines, respectively, and challenged with rabbit HEV at week 4. By week 11, rabbits vaccinated with the nanogel vaccine produced higher antibodies than those vaccinated with the subunit vaccine. Fecal viral shedding and viremia were identified in rabbits of the positive and nanogel control groups at weeks 6-10. However, there was no viral shedding and viremia in rabbits immunized with both the nanogel and subunit vaccines. Alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels were not elevated in any rabbit. However, histopathological examination revealed much less hepatic inflammation in rabbits of the nanogel vaccine group compared to the positive and nanogel control groups. Significant increases in IL-12 and IFN-gamma levels were identified from rabbits immunized with the nanogel vaccine. Collectively, these results indicate that the newly developed nanogel vaccine induced sufficient immunity leading to complete protection from HEV infection in rabbits. Application of this vaccine should be considered as a preventive measure against HEV infection in other animal species and humans. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction: Influenza causes a significant burden among Australian adults aged 50-64, however, vaccine coverage rates remain suboptimal. The National Immunisation Program (NIP) currently funds influenza vaccinations in this age group only for those at high risk of influenza complications.
   Aims: The main aim of this study was to determine whether a strategy of expanding the government-funded vaccination program to all adults 50-64 in preventing influenza-related hospitalisations will be cost beneficial to the government.
   Methods: A cost-benefit analysis from a governmental perspective was performed using parameters informed by publicly available databases and published literature. Costs included cost of vaccinations and general practitioner consultation while benefits included the savings from averted respiratory and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) hospitalisations.
   Results: In the base-case scenario, the proposed policy would prevent 314 influenza/pneumonia, 388 other respiratory and 1482 AMI hospitalisations in a year. The government would save $8.03 million with an incremental benefit-cost ratio of 1.40. Most savings were due to averted AMI hospitalisations. In alternative scenarios cost savings ranged from saving of $31.4 million to additional cost to the government of $15.4 million, with sensitive variation in vaccine administration practices (through general practitioner or pharmacists) and vaccine effectiveness estimates.
   Discussion: Extension of the NIP to include adults 50-64 years of age is likely to be cost beneficial to the government, although this finding is sensitive to vaccine administration cost, which varies if provided through general practitioners or pharmacists; and to variation in vaccine effectiveness. An increased role of pharmacists in immunisation programs would likely result in cost savings in an expanded adult immunisation program. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Vaccine refusal is shaped by the social ecology in which it occurs. How people who refuse vaccines are communicated to and treated may affect the nature and strength of their negative vaccine beliefs, and their responsiveness to health promotion messages. Yet little is known about how people who refuse vaccines are perceived by the public. Our research examined perceptions among pro vaccine Australians of the vaccine-refusal movement.
   Methods: Descriptions of the vaccine-refusal movement by 2666 pro-vaccine Australians were analysed using thematic discourse analysis. Descriptive themes were identified via inductive, iterative coding. Discourse analysis techniques were then used to interpret latent beliefs about the vaccine-refusal movement.
   Results: Participants had negative and stigmatising perceptions of the vaccine-refusal movement. They believed the movement is dangerous, misinformed, and comprised of charlatans and fools who are unintelligent, selfish, overly emotional, conspiratorial and scientifically illiterate. Discursive analysis showed that these perceptions were underpinned by beliefs that people would have to be defective in some way to believe anti-vaccine rhetoric. Furthermore, perceptions were underpinned by beliefs that the movement spreads not only disease, but also dangerous ideas that were seen to attack the social order, institutions, values and reason. Participants' intensely-negative views related to their inability to imagine why someone would refuse vaccines.
   Conclusions: This research provides a focused, qualitative account of public perceptions of the vaccine-refusal movement. The findings are concerning: stigma towards vaccine-refusing people may adversely affect their wellbeing and entrench their negative vaccine beliefs. The research suggests that more compassionate, nuanced discussion of vaccine refusal in the public sphere is needed. It also supports the need to systematically examine public attitudes towards vaccine refusal as a determinant of vaccine confidence. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction: In Australia, influenza hospitalises more children than any other vaccine preventable disease does. Children aged six months or older are recommended to receive annual influenza vaccines, and pregnant women are recommended vaccination to protect infants aged up to six months. However, vaccine uptake is low. This study explored influenza vaccination knowledge and behaviours of parents of children who were hospitalised for influenza, in order to inform strategies that target barriers to uptake.
   Methods: We conducted 27 semi-structured interviews with parents caregivers during or shortly after their child's hospitalisation for laboratory-confirmed influenza in 2017. Questions were guided by the Social Ecological Model exploring all levels of influence on vaccination uptake from the intrapersonal through to policy, via the parents' perspective. Transcripts were inductively analysed. Themes were categorised into the components of the Capability-Opportunity-Motivation-Behaviour (COM-B) model.
   Results: 20/27 children were aged six months or older; 16/20 had not received an influenza vaccine in 2017. Mothers of 4/7 infants aged less than six months were not vaccinated in pregnancy. The themes regarding barriers to influenza vaccination were: (1) Limited Capability - misinterpretations and knowledge gaps, (2) Lack of Opportunity - inconvenient vaccination pathway, missing recommendations, absence of promotion to all, and the social norm, and (3) Missing Motivation - hierarchy of perceived seriousness, safety concerns, a preference for 'natural' ways. Though most parents, now aware of the severity of influenza, intended to vaccinate their child in future seasons, some harboured reservations about necessity and safety. When parents were asked how to help them vaccinate their children, SMS reminders and information campaigns delivered through social media, schools and childcare were suggested.
   Conclusion: Improving parents' and providers' knowledge and confidence in influenza vaccination safety, efficacy, and benefits should be prioritised. This, together with making influenza vaccination more convenient for parents, would likely raise vaccine coverage. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID CHILDREN LESS-THAN-5 YEARS; DIARRHEA; AGE
AB Background: The majority of countries with the highest rotavirus-associated death rates are in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended routine vaccination against rotavirus worldwide, with unique age recommendations to administer the first dose before 15 weeks of age and last dose by 32 weeks of age. These age restrictions were relaxed in January 2013, but they may still lead to lower rotavirus vaccine coverage.
   Methods: Children age-eligible to have received rotavirus vaccine that were enrolled in Ghana, Zimbabwe, Rwanda or Burkina Faso's active rotavirus surveillance platforms from 2013 to 2017 and had a stool specimen that tested rotavirus-negative were included in the analysis. Proportion vaccinated and timeliness of rotavirus vaccine versus DTPw-HepB-Hib (pentavalent) first dose and last dose were compared at weeks 15 and 32, respectively, using Chi-square analyses. Odds ratios were calculated using logistic regression.
   Results: Among children who received rotavirus vaccine dose 1, 96-99% received this dose by 15 weeks of age and among children who received the last dose, 98-99% received it by 32 weeks of age. In all four countries, there was no significant difference in the proportion of children who received first dose rotavirus versus pentavalent vaccine by week 15, or last dose rotavirus versus concordant pentavalent vaccine by week 32. Delayed administration of first dose pentavalent vaccine was significantly associated with missing first dose of rotavirus vaccine in 3 of the 4 countries studied, although delays in administration were rare (1-4%).
   Conclusions: Rotavirus vaccination was timely among sentinel sites in these four early rotavirus vaccine-introducing countries in Africa. Late presentation for vaccination may have resulted in some children with access to care missing first dose of rotavirus vaccine; however, vaccination delays were infrequent and therefore the potential impact of the age restrictions on overall proportion vaccinated was minimal.

AB Trust underlies numerous decisions in health care, affecting vaccine uptake as well as care seeking rates, treatment adherence, and health outcomes. Although trust in the doctor-patient relationship has garnered much attention, trust in health care commodities such as vaccines and medicines has rarely been examined. We report findings from a cross-sectional survey to assess trust in vaccines vis-vis their trust in conventional medicines and traditional medicines in Uganda. Trust in vaccines, conventional and traditional medicines were assessed by adapting the vaccine hesitancy scale developed by the SAGE Working Group on Vaccine Hesitancy. Reported trust in vaccines and conventional medicines was much higher than trust in traditional medicines. Significant associations were observed between trust in vaccines and trust in conventional medicines. Of the trust components explored, respondents were most concerned about access to and safety of vaccines and medicines. Further, respondents' previous health care experiences, primary source of health information, and trust in providers' skills were significantly associated with reported trust in vaccines and medicines. Although strong levels of trust in vaccines and conventional medicines were observed overall, the findings identify areas where policies and communication efforts can focus to strengthen trust.

DE Influenza; Influenza vaccine; Vaccine effectiveness
ID TEST-NEGATIVE DESIGN; SEASON
AB Egg-based influenza vaccines could be less effective than cell-based vaccine due to adaptive mutations acquired for growth. We conducted a test-negative case-control study at Kaiser Permanente Southern California to assess vaccine effectiveness (VE) against hospitalization for laboratory-confirmed influenza during 2017-2018. Among the 1186 cases and 6946 controls, 74% and 59%, respectively, were ages >= 65-years. For any influenza, the adjusted relative VE of cell-based vaccine versus egg-based vaccines was 43% (95% CI: -45% to 77%) for patients ages < 65 years and 6% (95% CI: -46% to 39%) for patients ages >= 65-years. For influenza A(H3N2), the adjusted relative VE was 61% (95% CI: -63% to 91%) for patients ages < 65 years and -4% (95% CI: -70% to 37%) for patients ages >= 65 years. Statistically significant protection against influenza hospitalization of cell-based vaccine compared to egg-based vaccines was not observed, but further studies in additional influenza seasons are warranted.

AB Influenza season started in Italy during the month of October 2018, approaching the epidemic peak in January 2019. This report aim to explore the mid-term virologic surveillance data of the 2018-2019 influenza season in Sicily and to estimate the effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccine (VE) against A(H1N1) pdm09 and A(H3N2) influenza viruses. A test-negative design was used to evaluate influenza VE.
   In Sicily, almost all influenza infections were sustained by influenza type A viruses, of which 62.3% were A(H3N2) and 36.3% A(H1N1)pdm09. A reduction of laboratory confirmed influenza cases in Sicilian population immunized against influenza were observed. In particular, an overall significant protective values were observed for any influenza A viruses (Adj-VE = 44.0%; 95%CI: 11.2-64.7%), especially among 15-64 years old age group (Adj-VE = 59.5%; 95%CI: 0.03-83.1) and among the elderly (Adj-VE = 73.6%; 95% CI: 29.4-90.2).

AB Background: In 2016, India became one of the first countries in Asia to introduce an indigenously manufactured rotavirus vaccine. However, any new vaccine introduction needs to be meticulously planned to allow for strengthening of the existing immunization systems instead of burdening them.
   Methods: The process of rotavirus vaccine introduction in India started with the establishment of National Rotavirus Surveillance Network in 2005 which generated relevant evidence to inform policy level decisions to introduce the vaccine. The preparatory activities started with assessment of health systems and closing any gaps. This was followed by development of vaccine specific training packages and cascade training for programme managers and health workers. The introduction was complemented with strong communications systems and media involvement to allow for good acceptability of the vaccine on the ground. Each step of introduction was led by the government and technically supported by development partners.
   Results: India introduced rotavirus vaccine in a phased wise manner. In the first two phases the vaccine has been introduced in nine states of the country accounting for nearly 35% of the annual birth cohort of the country. From March 2016 to November 2017, approximately 13,260,000 rotavirus vaccine doses were administered in the country. The vaccine was well accepted by both the health workers and parents/caregivers.
   Conclusion: Rotavirus vaccine introduction in India is an excellent example of how government stewardship with well-defined roles for development partners can allow a new vaccine introduction to be used as a system strengthening activity. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: A high-dose, split-virion inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine (IIV3-HD; Fluzone (R) High-Dose, Sanofi Pasteur) is available for adults >= 65 years of age. This study examined the safety and immunogenicity of a quadrivalent high-dose split-virion inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV4-HD).
   Methods: This was a randomized, modified double-blind, active-controlled, multi-center trial in healthy adults >= 65 years of age. Subjects were randomized in a 4:1:1 ratio to receive a single intramuscular injection of IIV4-HD, the licensed IIV3-HD, or an IIV3-HD containing the alternate B-lineage strain. Hemagglutination inhibition (HAI), seroneutralisation, and anti-neuraminidase antibody titers were measured at baseline and day 28. Solicited reactions were collected for up to 7 days, unsolicited adverse events up to 28 days, and serious adverse events up to 180 days. The primary immunogenicity objective was to demonstrate that IIV4-HD induces HAI geometric mean titers (GMTs) and seroconversion rates that are non-inferior to those induced by IIV3-HD. Secondary objectives were to describe the safety of IIV4-HD and IIV3-HD and to demonstrate that IIV4-HD induces HAI GMTs and seroconversion rates that are superior to those induced by IIV3-HD not containing the same B-lineage strain.
   Results: The study included 2670 adults >= 65 years of age. For all four strains, HAI GMTs and seroconversion rates induced by IIV4-HD were non-inferior to those induced by IIV3-HDs containing the same strains. For both B strains, HAI GMTs and seroconversion rates induced by IIV4-HD were superior to those induced by IIV3-HD not containing the same B-lineage strain. Seroneutralisation and anti-neuraminidase antibody responses, measured in a subset of subjects, were similar. No new safety concerns were identified, and the safety profiles of IIV4-HD and IIV3-HD were similar.
   Conclusions: Adding a second B strain in IIV4-HD resulted in improved immunogenicity against the added strain without compromising the immunogenicity of the other strains or the vaccine's tolerability. (C) 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Objectives: Rotavirus vaccines (RV), included in Australia's National Immunisation Program from mid-July 2007, are unique in strict time limits for administration. Here, we report on timeliness of RV uptake, compare cumulative RV coverage to age 12 months with DTPa, and assess factors associated with receipt of RV among Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children.
   Methods: Birth records for 681,456 children born in two Australian states in 2007-2012 were probabilistically linked to national immunisation records. We assessed on-time coverage (defined as receipt of vaccine dose between 4 days prior to scheduled date and the recommended upper limit) for RV and compared this to diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTPa) vaccine. Logistic regression modelling was used to assess independent determinants of receipt of RV.
   Results: Compared to non-Aboriginal infants, on-time RV coverage was lower for all doses among Aboriginal infants. Post the upper age limit of RV dose2, DTPa dose2 coverage increased by 9-16% to >= 90%, whereas RV coverage remained around 77% (Aboriginal) and 85% (non-Aboriginal). Compared to first-born children, the adjusted odds of receiving >= 1 RV dose if born to a mother with >= 3 previous births was 0.30 (95%CI: 0.27-0.34) among Aboriginal, and 0.53 (95%CI: 0.51-0.55) among non-Aboriginal children. Prematurity (<33 weeks), low birthweight (<1500 g), maternal age <20 years, maternal smoking during pregnancy and living in a disadvantaged area were independently associated with decreased vaccine uptake.
   Conclusions: Aboriginal children are at greater risk of rotavirus disease than non-Aboriginal children and delayed vaccine receipt is substantially higher. Although specific programs targeting groups at risk of delayed vaccination might improve RV coverage, relaxation of upper age restrictions is most readily implementable, and its overall risk-benefit should be evaluated.

AB Eight different vaccination schemes using four commercially available inactivated Bluetongue vaccines against serotypes 4 and 8 in three different combinations (setting 1-3) were tested under field conditions for their ability to generate a measurable immune response in sheep.
   Animals of setting 1 (groups A-D) were simultaneously vaccinated using either individual injections at different locations (groups A & D) or double injection by a twin-syringe (groups B & C). For both application methods, a one-shot vaccination (groups C & D) was compared to a boosted vaccination (groups A & B). Sheep of setting 2 (groups E-G) were vaccinated in an alternating, boosted pattern at fortnightly intervals starting with serotype 4 (groups E & F) or vice versa (group G). Group H of setting 3 was vaccinated simultaneously and vaccines were injected individually as a one-shot application. Each group consisted of 30 sheep. The immunogenic response was tested in all sheep (n = 240) by ELISA (IDScreen (R) Bluetongue Competition), while serum neutralisation tests were performed in five to six sheep from each group (n=45).
   All vaccine combinations were well tolerated by all sheep. Of all vaccines and schemes described, the simultaneous double injected boosted vaccination of setting 1 (group B) yielded the highest median serotype-specific titres 26 weeks after the first vaccination (afv) and 100% seropositive animals (ELISA) one year afv. In setting 1, there were no relevant significant differences in the immunogenic response between simultaneously applied vaccines at different sites or at the same injection site. Importantly, a one-shot vaccination induced comparable immunogenicity to a boosted injection half a year afv. Low serotype-specific neutralising antibody levels were detected in settings 2 and 3 and are attributed to diverse factors which may have influenced the measured immunogenicity.

   UNITED-STATES; ADULTS; VIRUS; HBSAG-1018; INFECTION
AB Background: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) remains a major public health issue, although it is a vaccine preventable disease. Adults with diabetes are at greater risk of contracting HBV than the general population. Commonly used 3-dose HBV vaccines have reduced immunogenicity in older individuals and in those with diabetes mellitus.
   Methods: In this post hoc analysis of a phase 3 clinical trial, participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus aged 60-70 years received either 2-dose HBsAg/CpG 1018 (HEPLISAV-B (R), n = 327) at 0 and 4 weeks and placebo at 24 weeks or 3-dose HBsAg/alum (Engerix-B (R), n = 153) at 0, 4, and 24 weeks. Immunogenicity, including seroprotection rate (SPR) at week 28, and safety were assessed by subgroup (sex, body mass index, and smoking status). SPR was defined as antibody against hepatitis B surface antigen serum concentration >= 10 mIU/mL.
   Results: The SPR at week 28 was significantly higher with HBsAg/CpG 1018 (85.8% [235/274]) than with HBsAg/alum (58.5% [76/1301) in the per-protocol analysis, for an overall difference of 27.3% (95% CI, 18.0-36.8). SPRs with HBsAg/CpG 1018 were consistently markedly higher compared with HBsAg/alum, regardless of sex, body mass index, or smoking status. Adverse events and deaths were comparable between groups.
   Conclusions: Two-dose HBsAg/CpG 1018 provides a higher level of seroprotection against HBV than does a 3-dose vaccine (HBsAg/alum) with a similar safety profile in patients aged 60-70 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this paper was to describe the timeliness of the routine Dutch national immunisation schedule in preterm infants in their first year of life and to evaluate possible determinants of delay.
   Methods: Preterm infants were prospectively recruited between October 2015 and October 2017 and stratified according to GA (<28, 28-32 and 32-36 weeks). Data from the baseline parental questionnaire, monthly parental questionnaires and medical records were used to determine the immunisation age and proportion of infants timely receiving the first immunisations (between 42 and 63 days). Results were compared between the GA and birth weight (BW) groups. Determinants associated with timeliness of immunisation were studied by multivariate logistic regression analysis.
   Results: Timely start of immunisation occurs in 60.5% of preterm infants in the Netherlands. The proportion of infants receiving the first immunisation on time was lowest for the group with GA <28 weeks (37%). The mean age of the first immunisation across all GA groups was 62.7 days (range 33-118) and differed significantly between GA group <28 weeks and the other two GA groups of 28-32 and 3236 weeks (p < 0.001). Similar results were seen when stratified by BW. Multivariate analysis showed that low socioeconomic status (SES) and prolonged hospitalisation beyond 37 weeks each negatively influenced timeliness of the first immunisation.
   Conclusion: These findings indicate that start of immunisations was often delayed in prematures and differs for different GA groups, being lowest (37%) in infants <28 weeks GA. Lower SES and prolonged hospital stay beyond 37 weeks GA are important determinants of timeliness. Efforts to improve timeliness should focus most on counselling parents in lower SES.

AB Background: Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection is hyper-endemic in China, it is characterized with a high morbidity of fulminant hepatitis and mortality in pregnant women. The first hepatitis E vaccine, HEV 239, was licensed in China in 2011 which provides an effective preventive measure.
   Objective: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of vaccination with HEV 239 in women of childbearing age in China and whether HEV antibody screening should be considered before vaccination.
   Methods: A decision tree-Markov model was constructed to simulate HEV infection in a closed female cohort with an average first-marriage age of 25 years and evaluate health and economic outcomes of two potential vaccination strategies, direct vaccination and combined screening and vaccination, from a societal perspective. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER, additional costs per disability adjusted life-year (DALY) averted) was calculated for each vaccination strategy versus no vaccination and between two vaccination strategies. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of the model findings.
   Results: ICERs of direct vaccination and combined screening and vaccination versus no vaccination were $4040 and $3114 per DALY averted, respectively, much lower than 1-time Chinese per-capita GDP ($8127). Direct vaccination would need additional $45,455 for each DALY averted compared with combined screening and vaccination, far more than the 3-time per-capita GDP. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses confirmed our findings that two vaccination strategies would be cost-effective if the willingness-to-pay reached the 1-time per-capita GDP, and that combined screening and vaccination would be more cost-effective than direct vaccination strategy.
   Conclusion: Vaccinating women of childbearing age with HEV 239 would cost less than the 1-time per-capita GDP for each DALY averted in China, and the vaccination with a prior screening would be the optimal option. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: This study evaluated immunogenicity and safety of the adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) and the reduced-antigen-content diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap) when co-administered in adults aged >= 50 years.
   Methods: In this open label, multi-center study (NCT02052596), participants were randomized 1:1 to the Co-Administration group (RZV dose 1 and Tdap at Day 0 [DO], RZV dose 2 at Month 2 [M2]) or Control group (Tdap at DO, RZV dose 1 at M2, RZV dose 2 at M4). Co-primary objectives were evaluation of the vaccine response rate (VRR) to RZV in the Co-Administration group, and demonstration of non inferiority of the humoral responses to RZV and Tdap in the Co-Administration compared to Control group. Reactogenicity and safety of RZV and Tdap were also assessed.
   Results: VRR to RZV was 97.8% in the Co-Administration group. The non-inferiority criterion was met for the humoral response to RZV and for 4 Tdap antigens, but was not met for the Tdap antigen pertactin. Occurrences of solicited, unsolicited and serious adverse events, and potential immune-mediated diseases were similar between groups.
   Conclusions: Co-administration of RZV and Tdap did not interfere with the humoral immune response to RZV or 4 of the 5 Tdap antigens. No safety concerns were identified. (C) 2019 GSK. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Introduction: Because of the large animal reservoirs and reassortment capacity of rotaviruses (RVs) that pose the possibilities of waning the effectiveness of RV-vaccines, it remains essential to monitor vaccine effectiveness (VE) regularly. Although reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) remains sensitive for RV detection, physicians, especially in Japan, frequently use immunochromatography (IC)-based kits for RV diagnosis. Recently, IC is being used to calculate VE also. Herein, we investigated the validity of VEs determined by IC compared to that by RT-PCR during an outbreak in Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan.
   Methods: RVs in the stool or rectal swabs from children with acute gastroenteritis (AGE) were tested first by IC in the clinic and then by RT-PCR in the laboratory. A test-negative study design was used to examine VE.
   Results: Although the specificity of IC assay revealed 100%, its sensitivity remained weaker (67%) than that of RT-PCR that increased up to 88% depending on disease severity. VE assessed by IC remained stronger than that by RT-PCR: 79% (95% CI: 39-93%) by IC, and 58% (95% CI: -20% to 90%) by RT-PCR. However, VEs by IC and RT-PCR appeared almost similar in higher disease severity: 81.5% (95% CI: 40-94%) by IC and 72% (95% CI: 7-92%) by RT-PCR at severity >= 7, while 97.5% (95% CI: 77-99.7%) by IC and 92% (95% Cl: 58-98%) by RT-PCR at severity >= 11. We showed that RV-vaccinated children had 80% [OR = 0.192 (95% CI: 0.052-0.709) less chance to be detected by IC.
   Conclusion: Although the sensitivity and specificity of IC differ by brand type, generally, IC is not as sensitive as RT-PCR. Despite the VEs remain higher by IC, it looks comparable with that of RT-PCR in severe cases implying that VEs evaluated by IC against severe illness remain useful for VE-monitoring.

AB Background: The world's first dengue vaccine [Dengvaxia; Sanofi Pasteur] was licensed in 2015 and others are in development. Real-world evaluations of dengue vaccines will therefore soon be needed. We assessed feasibility of case control (CC) and test-negative (TN) design studies for dengue vaccine effectiveness by measuring associations between socio-demographic risk factors, and hospitalized dengue outcomes, in Malaysia.
   Methods: Following ethical approval, we conducted hospital-based dengue surveillance for one year in three referral hospitals. Suspected cases aged 9-25 years underwent dengue virological confirmation by RT-PCR and/or NS1 Ag ELISA at a central laboratory. Two age- and geography-matched hospitalized non dengue case-controls were recruited for a traditional CC study. Suspected cases testing negative were test-negative controls. Socio-demographic, risk factor and routine laboratory data were collected. Logistic regression models were used to estimate associations between confirmed dengue and risk factors.
   Results: We recruited 327 subjects; 155 were suspected of dengue. The planned sample size was not met. 124 (80%) of suspected cases were dengue-confirmed; seven were assessed as severe. Three had missing RT-PCR results; the study recruited 28 test-negative controls. Only 172 matched controls could be recruited; 90 cases were matched with >= 1 controls. Characteristics of cases and controls were mostly similar. By CC design, two variables were significant risk factors for hospitalized dengue: recent household dengue contact (OR: 54, 95% CI: 7.3-397) and recent neighbourhood insecticidal fogging (OR: 2.1; 95% CI: 1.3-3.6). In the TN design, no risk factors were identified. In comparison with gold-standard diagnostics, routine tests performed poorly.
   Conclusions: The CC design may be more appropriate than the TN design for hospitalized dengue vaccine effectiveness studies. Selection bias in case control selection could be minimized by protocol changes more easily than increasing TN design control numbers, because early-stage dengue diagnosis in endemic countries is highly specific.

AB Background: Two MenB vaccines with different dosing schedules are approved in the US: MenB-4C (2 doses) and MenB-FHbp (2-3 doses). Both vaccines were licensed on the basis of immunogenicity demonstrated after vaccine series completion. We evaluated vaccination completion and adherence to dosing schedules.
   Methods: This retrospective analysis used data from MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters Database (Commercial) January 1, 2015 - February 28, 2018 and Multi-State Medicaid Database (Medicaid) January 1, 2015 - December 31, 2017 to examine vaccine series completion and adherence to dosing schedule in individuals who initiated a MenB series at ages 16-23 years. Vaccine series completion and dose schedule adherence were assessed during a 15-month follow-up period after the first dose. Completion was defined as individual receipt of the recommended number of doses, with current recommendations applied retroactively to allow individuals who initiated the MenB-FHbp series to be complete with either the 2- or the 3-dose schedule.
   Results: The study population comprised 65,205 commercially-insured individuals (36,118 initiated MenB-4C; 29,087 initiated MenB-FHbp) and 13,535 Medicaid-covered individuals (10,153 initiated MenB-4C; 3382 initiated MenB-FHbp). In Commercial, 63% of individuals who initiated MenB-4C and 52% of individuals who initiated MenB-FHbp completed vaccination within 15 months; dosing schedule adherence was 62% for MenB-4C initiators and 18% for MenB-FHbp initiators. In Medicaid, 15-month completion rates for MenB-4C and MenB-FHbp initiators were 49% and 31%, respectively, with corresponding dosing schedule adherence of 48% and 8%. Among individuals who completed the series, median time to completion was 68 days for MenB-4C versus 258 days for MenB-FHbp in Commercial and 88 days for MenB-4C versus 309 days for MenB-FHbp in Medicaid.
   Conclusion: During the study period, MenB vaccine series completion was suboptimal. However, completion was significantly higher for MenB-4C, with notably shorter time to completion. This may reflect the flexible dosing schedule of MenB-4C. (C) 2019 GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals S.A. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The major elemental and oxygen isotopic features of Cretaceous granitoids in the coastal area of southeastern China cannot be adequately explained by existing Sr-Nd isotopic models of two-component crust-mantle mixing. In this paper, we report the whole-rock elemental, and Sr-, Nd-, and Hf-isotopes, and the zircon U-Pb age and HfO isotopic compositions for the Puqian, Danyang, Qingliangshan, Nanyu, and Qishan plutons in northeastern Fujian of this area to further investigate their petrogenesis. The examined rocks included pyroxene diorite, monzodiorite, granodioritic enclave, monzogranite and alkali-feldspar granite. Zircon U-Pb dating gave crystallization ages of 115 Ma for the Puqian monzogranite and granodioritic enclave, 97-109 Ma for the Danyang monzogranite, 99 Ma for the Nanyu pyroxene diorite, 97 Ma for the Qishan alkali-feldspar granite, and 97-103 Ma for the Qingliangshan alkali-feldspar granite. Our new Sr-Nd-Hf-O isotopic and petrogenetic studies of these granitoids showed that, aside from the ancient crustal component (delta O-18 = 7.5 parts per thousand, epsilon(Hf)(t) = - 10) and the mantle-derived magma (delta O-18 = 5.3 parts per thousand, epsilon(Hf)(t) = 2), a separate juvenile low delta O-18 crustal source (delta O-18 = 4,2 parts per thousand, epsilon(Hf)(t) = 2) must be involved. Since the emplacement of the diorite-monzodiorite-granodiorite-monzogranite suite and the A-type granite was coeval with pull-apart basins and bimodal volcanic rocks, the Cretaceous granitoids in northeastern Fujian, coastal area of southeastern China, were emplaced in an extensional setting, possibly due to the backarc extension and the changing drifting direction of the paleo-Pacific plate.

AB Crystalline structure, cage occupancy, and gas composition are important gas hydrate characteristics, which can be used to calculate the gas hydrate's stability and to estimate the energy potential. In May and October of 2015, a Guangzhou Marine Geological Survey team investigated two sites in the Haima cold seeps in the Qiongdongnan Basin, northern South China Sea. They recovered massive gas hydrate samples by conventional gravity coring. After the Shenhu Sea area and Dongsha Sea area, the Qiongdongnan Basin became a new area on the northern slope of the South China Sea where gas hydrates have been found. In order to reveal the structural and geochemical characteristics of the natural gas hydrates, samples were analyzed by micro-Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction under ambient pressure and low-temperature conditions. The results indicate that the gas hydrate samples from the Haima cold seeps are typical structure I hydrates with a hydration number of 6.12-6.19. In addition, trace amounts of H2S trapped in the hydrate were identified based on its characteristic vibrational signature. The gas composition and delta C-13-CH4 of the hydrate-bound gas samples were analyzed for gas-source correlation. All of the gas samples are dominated by methane with small amounts of ethane and propane and had relatively light 8 delta C-13-CH4 indicating that all of the hydrate-bound gases are mixtures of biogenic and thermogenic gas. The thermogenic gas is inferred to be mainly derived from the coal layers of the Late Miocene-Pliocene Yacheng Formation in the northern Lingshui sag.

AB We report for the first time the occurrence of leucogranite bodies that intruded the Ailaoshan metamorphic complex along the Ailao Shan-Red River (ASRR) shear zone. Leucogranites in Yuanyang, Southeast Yunnan province, are composed of quartz (similar to 30%), alkali feldspar (similar to 45%), plagioclase (similar to 5%), muscovite (similar to 13%) and biotite (similar to 3%) and other minor silicate minerals (similar to 3%, garnet, tourmaline). U-Pb dating of zircon from leucogranites yields a weighted mean age of 27.4 +/- 0.5 Ma, suggesting a late Oligocene anatexis event. These leucogranites are strongly peraluminous with A/CNK values of 1.01-1.19 and have high SiO2 (73.3-77.0 wt%) and K2O + Na2O (7.87-10.08 wt%), and low CaO (0.41-0.99 wt%), MgO (0.04-0.21 wt%), TiO2 (0.01-0.06 wt %) and Fe2O3T. (0.44-0.86 wt%) contents. They are geochemically similar to Himalayan leucogranites and are enriched in large-ion lithophile elements (e.g. Rb), and depleted in high-field-strength elements (e.g. Nb, Zr, and Hf). They have low Zr/Hf (12.3-22.5) and Nb/Ta (2.54-12.73) with negative Eu anomalies (Eu/Eu* =0.05-0.45), indicative of extensive fractional crystallization of plagioclase and zircon. In addition, these rocks have low Sr-87/Sr-86 (t) (0.7072-0.7111), high epsilon(Nd) (t) (-1.53 to -3.61). They contain zircon grains with epsilon(Hf) (-5 to +1.8) and old two-stage Hf model ages of 1.24-1.02 Ga, implying that they were probably derived from partial melting of amphibolite (old crustal material) within the lower crust. In combination with previous studies of metamorphism of the ASRR shear zone, our study demonstrates that the leucogranites may have been generated in a highly dynamic setting involving both extrusion and extension that defined the beginning of left-lateral slip-strike movement of the ASRR shear zone at 27 Ma.

AB The knowledge of the geometry, kinematics, assemblage and evolution of the Tan-Lu fault zone in late Cenozoic times remains scarce, despite its importance to understanding regional geodynamics and relevant mineralization and seismicity. To address the above issues, we provide new results of morphotectonic analysis, geological mapping, boreholes, seismic reflection and geochronology in the southern Tan-Lu fault zone at Sihong, Jiangsu Province, Eastern China. Field mapping in line with drilling and seismic reflection data suggest that the east-dipping Jiji-Wangji fault (F-4) and west-dipping Shanzuokou-Sihong fault (F-1), as the boundaries of the Tan-Lu fault zone, have been likely reactivated in a normal sense since the middle Neogene, and continued by the early-middle Pleistocene. These two faults predominantly controlled a graben that was filled by fluvial deposits in the fault zone. Additionally, the east-dipping Xinyi-Xindian fault (F-2) and west-dipping Mohe-Lingcheng fault (F-3) within the Tan-Lu fault zone had similar kinematics but behaved less active during the same time interval. The assemblage of the faults F-1-F-4 defined a horst-graben system in the Neogene-early Quaternary. During the late Pleistocene, intense deformation of the Tan-Lu fault zone concentrated on two splay faults, namely the fault F-2 and Qiaobeizhen-Suqian fault (F-5), while fault F-4 likely ceased. These two active faults (F-2 and F-5) were interpreted as reverse dextral strike slip structures under a NE-oriented compressional stress field, in which the other two faults F-1 and F-3 changed the normal sense to reverse. The activities of faults F-1 and F-5 caused uplift of the Chonggang Hill and controlled sedimentary depocenters between these two faults as revealed by boreholes. Optically stimulated luminescence data place age control on the activities of the reactivated fault F-2 between 105.6 +/- 1.1 ka and 46.9 +/- 5.9 ka and a newly developed fault F5 between 135.6 +/- 10.6 ka to 23.96 +/- 1.69 ka. Based on these results, we reconstructed the late Cenozoic tectonic evolution of the Tan-Lu fault zone, in which a dramatic kinematic shift probably occurred by the middle-late Pleistocene, possibly resulted from the far-field effect of the Indo-Asian convergence.

AB The Oligocene represents an important epoch in the history of the stepwise global climate evolution from a warm climate to a cooler climate. The change probably introduced selective pressures influencing ecological strategies and caused the past ecosystems restructured. However, little is known about the paleoenvironment and adaptive plant ecological strategies in the terrestrial realm of the low latitudes. Here, based on the plant fossils from the Baigang Formation of the Baise Basin, low-latitude China, the paleoclimate, paleovegetational type, and paleoecological strategy are reconstructed using leaf physiognomic analyses, Integrated Plant Record and leaf economics spectrum, respectively. The results show that, under a warm and wet sub-tropical climate with low seasonality, the Oligocene Baise flora was dominated by 'slow-return (maximized resource retention)' species but mixed with a considerable proportion of 'fast-return (rapid resource acquisition)' species. These ecological strategies might promote the community to maximize the use of limited living resources, and at the same time to better tolerate potential extreme situations. These results allow us to examine which ecological strategies that fossil plants selected under a given paleoclimate condition and might potentially provide a clue to predict the direction of ecological strategy changes in a future climate change scenario.

AB Evaluating the influences of laminae on shale pore structures is vital to understand the enrichment mechanism of lacustrine shale gas. This study investigates lacustrine shales from the lower Cretaceous Shahezi Formation in the Changling Sag, southern Songliao Basin, NE China, using mineralogical and geochemical analyses, CO2 & N-2 adsorption, and high-pressure mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP), to compare pore structure characteristics between laminated and massive shales, and elucidate their main controlling factors. Our results show that, laminae in lacustrine shales from the Shahezi Formation include those clay-rich, organic-rich, and silty ones, and minor carbonate-rich ones. Micropores in both laminated and massive shales show tri-modal distributions with main peaks at 0.47-0.54 nm, 0.57-0.63 nm, and 0.80-0.85 nm, respectively; however, the laminated shales exhibit great variations in micropore volumes among different samples. Mesopores within the laminated shales are smaller than those in the massive shales, and their pore volumes (PV) are about 1/3 less than those of the massive shales. This is due to that the laminated shales are rich in slit-like pores whereas the massive shales have more plate-like and ink-bottle pores. Thermal maturity (R-o) and total organic carbon (TOC) contents are the essential factors controlling the development of micropores and mesopores in the laminated shales, however they show weak effects on macropore development in this formation; this may be related to that shales from the Shahezi Formation generally have low TOC contents and type III kerogen. Clay minerals and quartz both have weak relevance to pore development in this formation.

AB Calc-silicate assemblages and skarn-type iron ores are associated with granite and granodiorite bodies intruding Triassic-Jurassic sedimentary strata in the Khak-Sorkh area in the central Urumieh-Dokhtar magmatic arc (UDMA), Iran. The intrusive bodies are metaluminous to slightly peraluminous, high-K calc-alkaline, and of I-type affinity. The skarn-type iron ore at Khak-Sorkh occurs in several ore bodies of variable sizes consisting of magnetite, subordinate hematite, and minor sulfides. The prograde assemblage of diopsidic pyroxene, andraditic garnet, and olivine is locally preserved, but the common intimate association of the iron ore with serpentine and lesser phlogopite suggests that ore formation occurred during retrograde hydrous reactions. Zircon dated using the isotope dilution TIMS U-Pb technique yields overlapping ages of 30.05 +/- 0.06 Ma and 29.94 +/- 0.09 Ma for two granite samples, consistent with the age of 29.51 +/- 0.13 Ma for coexisting monazite, constraining the time of magma emplacement. A similar age of 29.53 +/- 0.11 Ma was obtained for zircon grains from a highly epidotized granite offshoot enclosed in dolomitic limestones. Zircon from granodiorite provides a maximum age of 31.23 +/- 0.16 Ma, with coexisting xenotime and titanite yielding 29.49 +/- 0.10 M 29.67 +/- 0.42 Ma, respectively. The Pb-207/Pb-204 ratios for epidote from both endoskarn and exoskarn (15.584-15.669) are identical implying a common fluid source. They are distinguished from those for calcite from the host limestone (15.774-15.779), the latter consistent with upper crustal sources. The new results confirm that significant arctype plutonism occurred in the central UDMA during the Oligocene, consistent with the widespread I-type plutons in southern and northern sections of the UDMA.

AB Sinkholes and subsurface cavities can pose a real challenge to the stability of engineering constructions due to the risk of ground collapse and subsidence. The city of Al-Ain (UAE) is known to have several geo-hazards related to shallow sinkholes and karst cavities that have been reported in the locally outcropping formations. In this study, a micro-gravimetric survey was carried out around Al-Ain city in order to explore the subsurface density distribution of the karstified formations. A total number of 452 gravity measurements, covering an area of approximatively 1600 km(2) were used to invert the 3D density distribution to a depth of 1500 m. From this inversion, we have distinguished seven abnormally low density bodies ranging in size from 75 m to 750 m within the cavernous limestone Asmari Formation, consistent with a complex deep cavity system. The discovered cavities follow the local structural trend along the NW-SE direction, and lie within the high-risk areas of the geohazard map of Al-Ain city, in zones considered unstable in former geotechnical studies. The likely origin of the cavity systems is the dissolution of bedrock in water circulating in the limestone formations, along a connected shallow and deep fracture network. Further geophysical studies will be required to adequately map and investigate each deep cavity system, and to distinguish between the deep cavities and the shallow cavities reported in the area.

AB In the southwestern part of the Central Iran zone, the Golpaygan Metamorphic Complex (GMC) was evolved during the Zagros orogeny. This complex is composed of different metamorphic rocks including schist, marble, slate, gneiss and amphibolite. The metamorphic complex is overlain by a cover sequence including Permian carbonates, Jurassic elastic rocks, Cretaceous carbonates and Eocene elastic rocks. The internal structure of the GMC is characterized by four deformational stages. The first stage (D1) developed contemporaneously with the prograde regional metamorphism and resulted in formation of the first generation folds and prevailing axial plane foliation. The second stage of deformation (D2) was accompanied by deformation partitioning and formation of contractional shear zones. These structures were overprinted by different scale folds of the third stage (D3). The fourth stage of deformation (D4) is characterized by generation of the extensional shear zones which gradually transformed into normal faults. D1 and accompanied metamorphism may have resulted from steep subduction of the Neotethys Ocean beneath the active margin of the Central Iran zone during Jurassic times. D2-D3 structures and retrograde metamorphism may have been formed by a regional shortening and transpression deformation event which resulted in exposure of the metamorphic rocks in shallower levels during Cretaceous flat slab subduction. This condition lasted until Paleocene time when the slab roll-back caused extension and thinning of the overriding Central Iran plate. The subsequent decompression and regional extension resulted in intrusion of magmatic rocks and generation of D4 which formed the GMC and related magmatism in Paleocene-Eocene time.

AB With the increasing demand for hydrocarbons, exploration tends to be deeper and unconventional resources. However, whether there are the lower limits for exploration depth or thermal maturity (R-o) appears to be particularly essential. It is of considerable significance to determine the lower limit of hydrocarbon generation (LLHG) since this limit can provide guidelines for hydrocarbon potential estimation. According to the mechanisms of hydrocarbon generation and expulsion, five methods are combined to determine and verify the LLHG, whose values can be expressed by LLHG((Ro)) ( )and LLHG((H)). Source rock samples from the Paleogene Shahejie Formation (Es) in the Dongpu Depression were taken as an example to determine the LLHG, and then controlling factors of the LLHG were discussed. LLHG((Ro)) values for Es range from 3.23% to 3.97% (average 3.71%) and LLHG((H)) values range from 5244 m to 5525 in (average 5433 m). Regionally, LLHG values display obvious differences between the northern and southern of depression. LLHG values in the north are roughly larger than those in the south. In the northern depression, the LLHG(()(Ro)()) values are ranging from 3.61% to 3.97% (average 3.81%) and LLHG((H) )values are ranging from 5415 m to 5545 m (average 5488 m). However, in the southern part, the LLHG((Ro)) values range from 3.20% to 3.74% (average 3.48%) and the LLHG((Ro)) values range from 5265 m to 5375 in (average 5278 m). The main controlling factors for LLHG diversity between the north and the south of depression are organic matter (OM) type and abundance, formation temperature and pressure.

AB The Jianghan Basin, Central China, contains a thick, continuous sequence of early Cenozoic evaporite-bearing deposits that provide a wealth of information about early Cenozoic climate change and evaporites accumulation in East Asia. However, the paleoclimatic history of the basin and its effect on the evaporites are largely unknown. We obtained a deep drill core (SKD1, 2346.5 m long) from the late Cretaceous to early Eocene evaporite-bearing deposits in the Jianghan Basin. Detailed analyses of the lithofacies, mineralogy and geochemistry of the core indicate that salinization and deepening of the lake occurred (corresponding to the Yuyang Formation to the lower Xingouzui Formation), followed by desalting and shallowing (corresponding to the upper Xingouzui Formation). Reconstruction of the spatiotemporal evolution of the evaporites in the Jiangling depression suggests a transition from semi-arid conditions in the late Cretaceous to extremely arid conditions in the initial stage of the Eocene. The climate then became semi-humid during the deposition of the upper Xingouzui Formation, indicating a monsoon or monsoon-like climate in East Asia during the early Eocene. The southward migration of the depocenter of the Jiangling depression, coupled with a warm and extremely arid climate, resulted in the precipitation of evaporites during the accumulation of the upper Shashi Formation and the lower Xingouzui Formation. These results indicate great potential for identifying potash resources within the subsag in the southern Jiangling depression.

AB The Weng'an and Kaiyang phosphorite deposits are located in Central Guizhou, southwestern China, and formed within the Sinian (Ediacaran) Doushantuo Formation. A systematic investigation of the geology, mineralogy, and geochemistry of these phosphorites was conducted to constrain the redox environment, origin, and genetic mechanisms of Ediacaran phosphorite. In the lower ore layer (layer A), the phosphate minerals are mainly globular phosphate intraclasts, which are characterized by special sedimentary and reworking textures, including microgranular sedimentary, isopachous cement, shrinkage crack, and spongy texture. The phosphate minerals from the upper layer (layer B) have microbial phosphate components, namely embryo- and algae-like microfossils. These phosphatic microfossils have biological structures, and both consist of interior structure and isopachous wall. The P2O5 concentration of phosphorites in layer A reach 32.31%, somewhat higher than that in layer B (28.7%), whereas the P content in globular phosphate intraclasts (40.05%) resemble that of the microbial phosphate component (41.19%). Rocks from layer A have "left-inclining" post-Archean Australian shale (PAAS)-normalized rare earth element (REE) distributions, with higher Ce anomalies (Ce-anom) ranging from -0.12 to -0.01 (average -0.07). In contrast, rocks from layer B have "hat-shaped" PAAS-normalized REE distributions, with lower Ce-anom ranging from -0.32 to -0.23 (average -0.28). These geochemical characteristics suggest that hydrothermal fluids mixed with normal seawater might have contributed to metallogenesis, and the redox environment transitioned from anoxic to oxic from layer A to B. We conclude that the lower Doushantuo globular intraclasts formed by the mechanical reworking of previous phosphatic sediments, which were dominated by the strong mechanical power of seawater. The upper Doushantuo microbial phosphorite, on the other hand, formed by microbially mediated accretionary growth.

AB Biomass gasification in a three-dimensional bubbling fluidized bed is numerically simulated via the computational fluid dynamics coupled with the discrete element method (CFD-DEM) incorporated with heat and mass transfer, and chemical reactions. The particle-scale investigation of the heterogeneous reaction rate of the biomass particles along with the essential aspects (including fluid force, collision force, dispersion) of the solid phase is presented. The results indicate that biomass particles behave with larger horizontal and vertical distance especially in the freeboard region than the sand particles. Strong backmixing of the solid material exists near the sidewall, and large fluid force on the particles appears in the lower bed. Similar trends of the particle-scale fluid force, velocity and dispersion can be observed for the biomass and sand particles, though the magnitudes are larger for the biomass. Chemical reactions result in the axial segregation of the biomass particles. Among all the heterogeneous chemical reactions, the char oxidation is fastest while the hydrogenating reaction is the slowest. Increasing the temperature, and steam-to-biomass ratio and equivalence ratio values all enhance the particle-scale behaviors of both the biomass and sand particles. Also, the temperature improves nearly all the reaction rates. The results obtained here provide essential understanding regarding the particle-scale behaviors of the biomass gasification process in the fluidized bed.

AB Reactivity controlled compression ignition is a promising combustion strategy due to the combination of excellent thermal efficiency with ultra-low nitrogen oxides and particulate matter raw emissions. However, very high levels of unburned hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide emissions are found. It limits the reactivity controlled compression ignition use at very low loads and presents an additional challenge for the diesel oxidation catalyst. The low exhaust temperature and high carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon concentration can penalise the catalyst conversion efficiency. The objective of this work is to evaluate the response of an automotive diesel oxidation catalyst when used for reactivity controlled compression ignition combustion combining experimental and modelling approaches. For this purpose, dedicated tests have been done using diesel-gasoline as fuel combination in a single-cylinder engine. This way, the catalyst conversion efficiency has been determined within a wide operating range covering hydrocarbon adsorption conditions and the pollutants abatement dependence on the mass flow and temperature. The experimental results in the full-size catalyst has been analysed by modelling. A lumped diesel oxidation catalyst model has been applied to extend the results to multi-cylinder engine conditions and to determine the light-off curves for both carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons. These tests evidence the penalty in light-off temperature due to high pollutants mass fraction, which promotes inhibition limitations to the reaction rate.

AB Hydropower can aid in compensating for wind and photovoltaic power output fluctuations and uncertainties. In this study, a multi-objective optimization model was established by integrating wind and photovoltaic power with hydropower scheduling considering the total power generation, power output stability, and influence of hydropower on a downstream riverine ecosystem. An improved adaptive reference point-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm was employed to solve the wind-photovoltaic-hydropower system problem with various complicated constraints. Moreover, the large-scale system decomposition principle was used to decouple a wind-photovoltaic-hydropower system into a wind-photovoltaic compensated subsystem and a hydropower system. A combined solution method was developed according to the subsystem characteristics to improve the model efficiency. Considering that direct crossover and mutation of hydropower systems may not yield feasible solutions, dynamic feasible regions for crossover and mutation were constructed for multi-objective optimal scheduling. Furthermore, a stochastic multi-criteria decision making model that accounts for the uncertainty of criterion information was established, and the non-dominated solution obtained using the improved multi-objective evolutionary algorithm was employed for decision-making. The results showed that the total power generation, power output stability, and downstream riverine ecosystem have strong competitive relationships, and the improved adaptive reference point-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm can produce superior quality Pareto optimal solutions with uniform distribution. Subsequently, the stochastic multi-criteria decision making model was used to rank the Pareto optimal solutions, where each solution can obtain several ranks with different probabilities, providing extensive information for use in decision-making.

AB For an in-line arrangement of two drag-type hydrokinetic rotors, flow patterns between the two rotors and the rotor performance were investigated. The flows were measured using time-resolved particle image velocimetry (TR-PIV) technique. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technique was used to quantify the rotor performance. Emphasis was placed upon the influence of the rotor angle and the inter-rotor distance. The results show that two large-scale vortices dominate the wake of the upstream rotor. Expanding, shrinking and shifting of the large-scale vortices significantly influence the rotor performance. Three distinct regions, velocity-rising, velocity declining and velocity-recovery regions, are defined. They serve as indicators of the impact of the downstream rotor on the upstream rotor. Instantaneous wake flow patterns between the two rotors alter with the orientation of the two rotors. The most adverse effect on the upstream rotor arises as the upstream rotor area that faces the incident flow reaches its maximum. At high upstream velocity, both the torque output and the power coefficient of the upstream rotor approach their counterparts associated with the single rotor. With increasing inter-rotor distance, the negative impact of the downstream rotor on the upstream rotor decays continuously. An inter-rotor distance larger than five times the rotor diameter is suggested.

AB The operation safety of high-speed railways has received great concern globally in recent years. The power supply of the electronic monitoring devices alongside high-speed railway tunnels and their maintenance are becoming increasingly important. In this paper, a portable renewable wind energy harvesting system integrated with an S-rotor and H-rotor has been designed to provide electricity to the monitoring sensors alongside railway tunnels in remote areas with shortages in the electricity supply. The proposed renewable wind energy harvesting system can harvest the wind energy inside the tunnel and convert it into electricity for self-powered applications. The renewable wind energy harvesting system scheme mainly consists of three components: a portable wind harvester mechanism, a generator module and a power storage module. The S-rotor and H-rotor are integrated as the wind harvester mechanisms in this system. The S-rotor harvests natural wind energy, and the H-rotor harvests piston wind energy when a high-speed train passes through the tunnel. Meanwhile, the S-rotor and H-rotor rotate the generator module separately through the one-way bearing. Finally, the supercapacitors in the power storage module are used to store the electrical energy. Experiments were conducted to study the performance of the system. A maximum electrical power output of 107.76 mW and a maximum efficiency of 23.2% are demonstrated in the test. The experimental data indicate that the wind energy harvesting system is beneficial and is a promising method to generate energy used for renewable self-powered applications in high-speed railway tunnels.

AB Solar thermoelectric generator (STEG) systems are attractive because they can convert solar heat directly into electricity via solid-state thermoelectric generators. Nevertheless, its low energy conversion efficiency has prevented it from wide-scale implementation and commercialization. To date, the best experimental efficiency for STEG without concentrated is 4.6%, and only testing single thermoelectric unicouple within a specific application deployment context. In this paper, a mathematical model containing various heat losses ignored by previous studies are developed and validated to confirm the possibility of improved STEG performance. We developed a high-performance solar thermoelectric hybrid device composed of heat pipe evacuated tubular collector, solar selective absorber, and TE modules by conducting a comprehensive optimization in terms of thermoelectric material, the optical and thermal efficiency of solar selective absorber, heat management and device integration. The experimental results show that the thermoelectric conversion efficiency of proposed device was enhanced significantly, it produced a peak electrical efficiency of 5.2%. And the residual solar energy is stored for either power generation or domestic used. The peak exergy efficiency of the system reached up to 7.17%. The efficiency is higher than the previously reported best value. We experimentally demonstrated the feasible of the scale application of solar thermoelectric generators. And the results indicated that STEG system is a promising alternative solar energy thermal utilization technology in the small scale co-generation applications.

AB Efficient utilization of coal for power generation with carbon capture as well as development of solar hybrid system are being aggressively researched currently. To advance the utilization of solar energy and achieve zero emission for coal-based power generation more efficiently, a novel direct-fired, oxy-combustion supercritical carbon dioxide power cycle integrated with the solar-driven coal gasification was proposed. In the proposed system, the concentrated solar energy is utilized for coal gasification, and then the produced syngas is combusted with high-purity oxygen to drive a semi-closed supercritical carbon dioxide power cycle with intensive heat recuperation and near-zero carbon emission. Detailed analytical models based on energy and material balance were developed and the overall system thermodynamic performance were determined by the process simulation. Results showed that, at the designate point, the proposed system can save 29.9% of coal consumption and the net system energy efficiency and exergy efficiency soar to 43.4% and 44.6%, respectively; and the annualized coal saving can reach 10.46 kilo tonnes with the annual solar-to-electricity efficiency at 16.9%. The proposed concept may provide a new approach to advancing solar-coal hybridization power generation with near-zero emission.

AB Reactivity controlled compression ignition engines have been proven to have better performance comparing with other methods of low temperature combustion strategies. Using various fuels can have different outputs according to the chemical products and reactions as well as heating values. In this study, a numerical model beside experimental data as validation is used to investigate the effects of using additive on combustion characteristics of natural gas/dimethyl-ether and natural-gas/diesel Reactivity controlled compression ignition engines. Hydrogen is used as additive with 3, 6 and 9 percentage of heating value in the fuel mixture. Results show higher indicated mean effective pressure in all cases of using diesel as high reactivity fuel. In addition, investigation on the combustion characteristics shows that natural gas/diesel cases have advanced start of combustion and combustion phasing, while burn duration in natural gas/dimethyl-ether cases is higher than natural gas/diesel cases. By adding hydrogen species, it is seen that hydrogen has more effect on the start of combustion of natural gas/dimethyl-ether case where adding 9% hydrogen, advanced the start of combustion about 2 crank angle degree while this amount for natural gas/diesel case is about 0.3. In all cases of using diesel as high reactivity fuel, temperature is higher than dimethyl-ether used cases, which causes to produce more nitrogen oxides; for example, in 9% hydrogen addition, natural gas/diesel mode produced 0.54 g/kW/h nitrogen oxide more than natural gas/dimethyl-ether mode. Based on achieved results, carbon monoxide emission in natural gas/diesel mode is lower than 2 g/kW/h for all cases where this emission is higher than 8 g/kW/h in each case of natural gas/dimethyl-ether. This condition was also occurred for unburned hydrocarbons emissions, where this emission is higher than 11 g/kW/h for natural gas/dimethyl-ether fueling case while it is lower than 2 g/kW/h for natural gas/diesel mode. Quantitatively comparison shows that hydrogen addition is more effective on natural gas/dimethyl-ether reactivity controlled compression ignition mode. According to dimethyl-ether breaking up process, start of injection provides a time to decomposition of dimethyl-ether to its products, especially Methane. Based on numerical results, more than 10% of dimethyl-ether is broken up before start of combustion that represented importance of start of injection in natural gas/dimethyl-ether case.

AB In this paper, a comparative study for structural design of battery thermal management system is presented for electric vehicles. A thermal model for the pouch battery pack with liquid cooling is developed for thermal analysis of various pack designs. Typical battery pack with fin-cooling structure is set as a reference design, and thermal behavior of the battery pack is examined in the aspect of cooling performance and temperature uniformity. Numerical results indicate that poor heat conductivity from the bottom of the cell stack to the cooling plate is one of the major barriers to the efficient heat dissipation and asymmetric design of fin-cell arrangement have negative effect on the temperature uniformity of the battery pack. To improve the performance of the thermal management system, various structural designs are suggested and evaluated based on plural criteria. A new structural design for the large-scale battery pack is suggested to enhance the cooling performance and temperature uniformity of the battery pack minimizing the increase in system volume, weight, and pressure drop.

AB A novel flexible energy-use mechanism is proposed based on the energy coordination among electrolyzers, steam methane reforming (SMR) plants and gas-fired units in the day-ahead scheduling of the integrated gas-electrical system. The power-to-gas (P2G) energy conversion method provides an effective solution to the energy dilemma in China. Nevertheless, this method requires a high-value chain for application due to its high investment cost at present. Producing, and then selling, hydrogen via electrolyzers is more valuable than storing it for a later generation. The two hydrogen production methods of SMR and electrolysis can be combined with the operation optimization of electrical and natural gas systems to form a flexible energy-use mechanism. A model of the flexible energy-use mechanism is established. The model can be integrated into interdependent natural gas and electricity systems, aiming to alleviate the shortage of natural gas, improve energy efficiency and lower carbon emissions. To demonstrate the economic feasibility and carbon dioxide emissions reduction of the proposed mechanism, a bus-6 power system integrated with a node-6 natural gas system and an IEEE 30-bus system with a modified Belgian 20-node gas system are examined. It is concluded that the proposed flexible energy-use mechanism in the power and natural gas systems has higher economic value and lower carbon emissions than the power-to-hydrogen-to-methane-to-pipeline path.

AB This paper presents the energy and economic analysis of hybrid cogeneration power plant located in Poland, that consist of a hard coal co-generation unit, water boilers, and gas engines. The sensitivity analysis is performed to study the effect of a significant change occurred in the energy market since the beginning of 2018. Emissions purchase costs increased in EU Countries of about similar to 200% and fossil fuels costs of similar to 15%, which is reflected in electric and thermal energy price. To understand the level of the impact, detailed analysis with optional scenarios of further price increase is performed.
   The detailed analysis is performed by using a dedicated mathematical model of the installation, with respect to the real operation parameters, technology obstructions and macroeconomic situation. The study examined five different scenarios, which consider the price increase of CO2 emission allowances and fuels. The input heating power profile was chosen for turnover seasons, to reflect production units operate out of nominal parameters at lower efficiencies. The performed analysis reveals the weakness of hard coal technologies on the changing energy market, especially on the CO2 allowances price increase.

AB Building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) coupled with phase change materials (PCM) (BIPV/PCM) provide opportunities for reducing the photovoltaic (PV) panel temperature to increase the overall efficiency of the BIPV, while also transferring the extracted heat for building energy load management. A comprehensive numerical study is conducted to simulate the effects of different BIPV design parameters namely, BIPV height (H), air gap between BIPV/PCM and wall (delta(Air)) thickness (delta(PCM)), and air mass flow rate ((m) over dot) on the maximum PV panel temperature, the power production by the PV, and the energy extracted by the air. Optimum BIPV/PCM designs are derived from the studies for three different phase change materials, with the goal of maximizing the total energy from photovoltaics (E-PV) and extracted heat (E-air), subject to the constraint of keeping the maximum PV panel temperature to within acceptable values. From the obtained results it is concluded that for the selected range of parameters, the optimum values of delta(PCM), H, delta(Air )and m are, respectively, 0.04 m, 3 m, 0.02 m and 0.18 kg/s for maximizing E-PV and 0 m, 3 m, 0.08 m and 0.091 kg/s for maximizing E-air without any constraints.

AB The current experimental work targets to progress in the daily production of fresh water of a single solar still. Two identical solar parabolic dishes were equipped with two conical tanks were integrated with a single solar still and four modules of PV with total power output 1000 W. Each PV module is about 1650 mm x 992 mm x 46 mm dimensions. The proposed system was constructed and tested for three months under the weather conditions of Ismailia, Egypt. The area ratio of the receiver to the absorber is 100. The solar parabolic dish is of 2000 mm diameter. The modified system is used to increase the water basin temperature during the sunrise period. The basin water is recirculated to the cone tanks and sprayed in the solar still to increase the evaporation rate. The proposed system is controlled with a control unit which receives the input signals from various sensors and operates the output. The effect of basin water depths is studied at two values 10 and 20 mm. The experimental results were conducted in three cases that represent the conventional solar still, one solar parabolic dish, and two solar parabolic dishes. The experimental results showed that, the daily distillate productivity in case of one solar dish is 8.8 and 5.45 kg/day at the two water depths 10 and 20 mm, respectively. The usage of the two solar dishes integrates with the solar still increase the daily productivity to reach 13.63 and 7.69 kg/day at the two water depths 10 and 20 mm respectively.

AB Solar and wind energy are the significant renewable energy sources that can be used to tackle the climate change issue. The aim of the study is to design and compare different architectures of community-level energy systems, in order to find a positive energy community in cold climate. The design proposed is a centralized solar district heating network, which is integrated with renewable-based electricity network to meet the heating and electrical demand of a community of 100 houses. The renewable-based energy system consists of photovoltaic panels, wind turbines and stationary electrical storage. In present study the demand of the building appliances, district heating network auxiliaries and electric vehicles are included. TRNSYS is used to simulate these systems. Lastly, multi-objective optimization is done using MOBO (Multi-objective optimization tool). The objective of the optimization problem is to minimize two objective functions-the imported electricity and the life cycle costs. The onsite energy fraction, matching and exported electricity are also evaluated for comparison. The optimization results illustrate that in terms of imported energy, the cases with 600 kW (200 wind turbines) and storages are better compared to the cases without the turbines and storage. For the high performing system (200 turbines with storages and 75 electric vehicles), the corresponding onsite energy fraction (OEF) varied from 1% to 97% and the onsite energy matching (OEM) varied from 76% to 62%, respectively, while the imported electricity can be reduced to 2 kWh/m(2)/yr. However without storage, the onsite energy fraction (OEF) varied from 1% to 58% and the onsite energy matching (OEM) varied from 90% to 27% respectively. In all the systems, initially investments are made in the wind turbines, storages and lastly in the photovoltaic panels to improve the performance of the optimized solutions. It is found that storages can improve the onsite fraction and matching. Moreover, photovoltaic becomes more important in the cases with higher number of electric vehicles.

AB In this research paper, a novel combined, cooling, heating and, power (CCHP) system is proposed consisting of Parabolic trough solar collectors (PTSC) field, a dual-tank molten salt heat storage, a Proton exchange membrane electrolyzer (PEME), an Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) and a single effect Li/Br water absorption chiller. The first law of thermodynamics was applied for analyzing the proposed CCHP system. A multi-objective optimization is conducted with respect to exergy efficiency and total cost rate as two objective functions. In order to determine the optimal point in multi-objective optimization, NSGA-II algorithm was applied for the optimization purpose. Matlab software and python are employed to determine the system optimum operating conditions. The optimum solutions for the NSGA-II multi-objective optimization are 79% and 0.058 ($/s) for exergy efficiency and total cost rate, respectively. The results of single objective optimization are 0.0447 ($/s) for the economic objective function and 87.53% for the exergy efficiency objective function. The sensitivity of the Pareto frontier for different interest rates is also investigated and the results show that at the lower system exergy efficiency, the influence of the interest rate is more significant. In addition, Generalized Differential Evaluation (GDE3), Indicator-based evolutionary algorithm (IBEA), speed-constrained Multi-objective (SMPSO), and strength Pareto Evolutionary algorithm (SPEA) algorithms are also applied for the optimization of the proposed CCHP and the results of the algorithm are compared with each other. The IBEA algorithm was found the best approach to obtain the Pareto optimum solution. The comparison between NSGA-II and IBEA shows that the IBEA exergy efficiency of the optimum solution increase by 2.5% in comparison with NSGA-II and the IBEA cost rates decrease by 7% in comparison with NSGA-II.

AB The district heating system with distributed variable speed pumps can provide substantial energy savings, compared with the district heating system with conventional central circulating pump. However, for large-scale district heating systems, using distributed pumps at all substations leads to high pressures of the network terminals, which will increase the risk of pipe bursting and failure of heat supply. In this paper, the dilemma is overcome by combining the central circulating pump with distributed pumps to construct a novel hybrid district heating system, which can improve energy saving and reduce the network pressures of the district heating system. The optimal pressure control strategy for the new type of district heating network is developed to minimize the total pump power. In order to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed configuration, two cases were investigated regarding an existing district heating system with 1 heat source and 112 substations, including (I) varying the flow rate at all substations with the same relative rate, and (II) varying the flow rate at all substations with different relative rates. Analysis results show that compared with the conventional constant pressure difference control strategy, the hybrid system controlled by the optimal pressure control strategy ensures more stable operation conditions for the distributed pumps and can save 57% pump power when flow rate is 0.3.

AB This paper proposes a solar-assisted hybrid combined cooling, heating and power (CCHP) system that consists of an internal combustion engine, solar heat collectors, an absorption heat pump, a heat exchanger, and a thermal storage tank. On the basis of thermodynamic modelling and validation, the hybrid system was investigated from its energy, exergy, exergo-economic and exergo-environmental performances. The heat storage ratio and supplemental heat ratio were defined to consider the dynamic off-design operations and evaluate the contributions of thermal storage and supplement under the static design conditions, whose impacts on system efficiency and unit cost of products were discussed. For a specific case study, the energy and exergy analyses with the Sankey diagrams indicated that the hybrid system achieves annual energy efficiency of 76.3% and exergy efficiency of 22.4%. The unit costs of products were determined using exergo-economic analysis based on energy level, and the costs of products including and excluding carbon dioxide emission cost were compared. Compared to the conventional CCHP system without solar energy, the hybrid system saves 11.3% of natural gas to reduce carbon dioxide emission and shortens the capital payback period by 1 year.

AB Supercritical carbon dioxide Brayton cycle has emerged as a promising power cycle that features high efficiency, compact and simpler cycle layout, minimal impact on the environment and integration capability on a wide range of energy conversion applications. The cycle operates near the critical point of carbon dioxide where properties of the supercritical carbon dioxide fluctuate dramatically, therefore an accurate analysis of the cycle's performance will require detailed mathematical models of its components. In this context, a 10 MWe recompression supercritical carbon dioxide Brayton cycle has been analyzed using in-house cycle design point and off-design codes. In contrast to the previously adopted simplified component models, the employed codes utilize compressor and turbine mean line codes along with a detailed heat exchanger model to accommodate real design configurations of the cycle's components and variations in the thermophysical properties of the working fluid. Cycle design point analysis suggested that a superior performance could be achieved by selecting compressor inlet conditions close to the critical point of carbon dioxide. Moreover, cycle off-design results were also computed with and without adjusting the defined control variables. Computed results revealed that the cycle's performance could be enhanced significantly during off-design conditions by adjusting the defined control variables particularly if off-design values corresponded to compressor's higher inlet temperature and lower inlet pressure.

AB High share of variable renewable energy is challenging to the traditional power system technically and economically. This calls for a significant increase to the system flexibility, which might result in the costs associated with energy storage and costly upgrades to the traditional transmission and distribution system. This paper presents a multi-stage battery transportation and logistics optimization method to increase the renewable energy consumptions, economics, and mobilities of the battery utilization. A new approach is proposed in which the batteries are charged in the renewable power plants and transported back and forth by railways between the renewable power plants and cities. Based on the forecasts of battery supplies/demands, multiple optimization stages (full train transport and carpooling) are designed by the branch-and-bound algorithm and genetic algorithm respectively. The proposed battery transportation and logistics concept and model are performed using the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region in China as an example. The results show that the levelized cost of energy of the battery transportation and logistics model is $0.045/kWh averagely. Also, by the use of mobilized batteries, the proposed battery transportation and logistics model increases the system flexibilities and renewable energy deliveries to the end users without the reinforcement of transmission and distribution system and any constraint from a highly penetrated power system.

AB Utilization of glycerol is important for the sustainable development of biodiesel industry. In this study, green conversion of glycerol to methyl lactate was realized over Au/CuO and Sn-Beta binary catalyst at low temperature in base-free methanol, 86% glycerol conversion and 60% methyl lactate yield can be obtained at 90 degrees C. Precursors for preparation of CuO have significant influence on the catalytic oxidative activity of Au/CuO. Oxygen mobility of CuO prepared from copper acetate (CuO-CA) is the highest compared to CuO materials prepared from copper nitrate (CuO-CN) and commercial CuO (CuO-Commercial). Meanwhile, dispersion of Au particles is significantly affected by the precursor for synthesis of CuO. Au particles on CuO-CA are small (2-4 nm) and uniform. Accordingly, Au/CuO-CA shows the best catalytic activity for the oxidation of glycerol. Synergism of oxidative active sites on Au/CuO-CA and Lewis acid sites on Sn-Beta facilitates the production of methyl lactate from glycerol. Meanwhile, the catalysts are recyclable and can be reused easily without any treatment.

AB Chemical looping air separation (CLAS), a simple and efficient oxygen production technology, can be efficiently integrated with the moderate or intense low-oxygen dilution (MILD) combustion and oxy-fuel combustion technologies. Mn-based oxygen carrier is considered to be a hopeful candidate for the CLAS, but its redox kinetics has rarely been reported. In this work, the most suitable kinetic mechanisms for reduction and oxidation reactions are determined by thermogravimetric analyses. By coupling the obtained redox reaction kinetics and gas-solid flow hydrodynamics, a one-dimensional model of the interconnected fast fluidized bed and bubbling fluidized bed is built using sequential modular approach for simulating the chemical and physical phenomena in the CLAS process. The effects of main operation parameters on the CLAS performance are investigated by sensitivity analyses. The mole fraction of generated oxygen is found increasing with the increments of reduction temperature and air flow rate. Moreover, the system specific power consumption (SPC) is decreased when the temperatures of the two fluidized beds are similar. SPC can be as low as 0.076 kWh/m(3) at the oxidation and reduction temperatures of 770 degrees C, the air flow rate of 50 Nm(3)/h, and the CO2 flow rate of 23 Nm(3)/h, which is 18% of the energy requirement of conventional cryogenic air separation system.

AB An integrated system for the simultaneous production of electricity and fresh water is proposed based on a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC). In this system, a Kalina cycle is utilized to recover waste heat from the SOFC stack. Furthermore, a thermoelectric generator is employed to recover the heat dissipated in the Kalina condenser. In the proposed configuration, the energy required for reverse osmosis desalination can be supplied by a Kalina cycle and a thermoelectric generator. The system uses methane as its primary fuel. Electrochemical equations for the fuel cell are considered, as are thermodynamic and exergy-economic relations for the components of the system. The effects on the performance of the proposed hybrid system of variations in design parameters such as current density, SOFC inlet temperature, fuel utilization factor, inlet pressure of the Kalina cycle turbine and concentration of water-ammonia solution in the Kalina cycle are examined. The SOFC stack is seen to make the highest contribution to the total exergy destruction of the system. To strive simultaneously for maximum efficiency and minimum total cost, optimization is carried out using a genetic algorithm. The total optimum point of the system is the trade-off between the optimization objectives. At this point, the net electrical power production is about 1.3 MW and the production rate of fresh water reaches 226 m(3)/day, while the exergy efficiency and total cost rate are 54% and 36.8 $/hr, respectively.

AB As a relatively high energy-consuming in China, the chemical process is important and has potential to be optimized for energy saving, economic benefits and environmental protection. Multiple goals can be coordinated using multi-objective optimization algorithms. In order to improve the exploration and exploitation abilities in optimizing multiple objectives, a constrained competing evolutionary membrane algorithm is proposed. The proposed algorithm takes advantages of the distributed and parallel computing mode of the membrane computing. Populations are evolved independently in each membrane and share information between membranes based on competing communication rules. Meanwhile, the skin membrane archives global elitist solutions and serves as guidance for inner evolution processes. Finally, the optimization experiments on the ethylene cracking process, as an important production of complex chemical processes, prove that the proposed algorithm can provide enough selection for decision makers with well-distributed and converged candidate solutions. Furthermore, the solutions lead the ethylene cracking process to reach the coordinated optimum ethylene or propylene production, oil consumption reduction and carbon dioxide emission reduction. In average, the optimization solutions bring about reduction of 2697.58 tons of feed oil and 8281.57 tons of carbon dioxide emission.

AB Co-pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass and microalgae could greatly improve bio-oil quality. In order to understand the interaction, nitrogen transformation mechanism, and better use lignocellulosic biomass and microalgae, co-pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass (bamboo waste (Ba)) and amino acids (glutamic acid (Glu) and aspartic acid (Asp)) was performed by TG-FTIR and Py-GC/MS technique. Results showed that individual pyrolysis of Glu and Asp formed 52% pyrrolidinone and 75% maleimide through intramolecular dehydration reactions, respectively, with the releasing of CO2, C=O and NH3. Besides, co-pyrolysis of Ba with Glu and Asp decreased the biomass decomposition temperature largely. Furthermore, co-pyrolysis greatly increased the yield of CO2 and NH3, and promoted the formation of phenols, O-containing species (but oxygen yield decreased), while inhibited the generation of N-species (decreased about 50%) in bio-oil, through strong Maillard reaction, ketonization, deamination, and decarboxylation reactions. At last, the possible reaction pathways of co-pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass and amino acids were proposed. In conclusion, co-pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass and amino acids could significantly improve the quality of bio-oil, and effectively control the nitrogen transformation into bio-oil.

AB Photovoltaic (PV) systems are continuously exposed to many potential faults, causing significant power generation losses. Accurate fault detection procedures are crucial to ensure the reliable operating condition. This paper presents simple, efficient and easy to implement approach to detect the most common failures, due to short-circuit (SC) and open-circuit (OC) faults, inverter disconnection (ID) and partial shading (PS). The proposed procedure introduces three indicators namely, current indicator , voltage indicator beta and power indicator gamma with the main function to distinguish healthy and faulty operating conditions. To this end, single-diode model is adopted to generate a trusted PV model in combination with the best-so-far artificial bees colony (ABC) optimization algorithm in order to extract the unknown model parameters. Subsequently, the maximum power point (MPP) coordinates are estimated to mimic the real operating PV system. Measured and predicted MPP coordinates allow the calculation of current, voltage and power indicators. For each indicator, an upper and lower thresholds has been established by trial and error. The computed value of each indicator will reveal the healthy or faulty operation of the PV system when it is within or outside the predefined threshold respectively. An experimental evaluation is presented by using the monitored data of the 3.2 kW(p) grid-connected PV system located at the roof of the Renewable Energy Development Centre (CDER), Algeria.

AB The flame combustion characteristics of low heat value gas are studied by simulation and experimental methods. The flame radius, the stretched flame velocity, and laminar burning velocity at various ratios of nitrogen and fuel/air equivalence ratios are obtained. The turbulent flame propagation rate, the flame development time and rapid burning time of the mean cycle, and the flame surface wrinkle at various hydrogen fractions are also analysed. The influence of different ignition positions on the flame surface wrinkle is studied. The results show that the flame propagation speed is the fastest under the stoichiometric equivalence ratio. With the increase of the volume fraction of nitrogen, the flame propagation speed and the flame surface wrinkles decrease, and the flame development time of the mean cycle increases rapidly. With the increase of the hydrogen fraction, the turbulent flame rate and the flame surface wrinkle gradually increase, while the flame development time of the mean cycle reduces. The increase of nitrogen and hydrogen contents has no obvious effect on the rapid burning time of the mean cycle. The ignition position has a great influence on combustion efficiency and development form of the flame surface.

AB A compiled dataset of hourly-averaged solar power generation (MW) for Germany in 2016 integrates eight influencing weather, environmental and market price variables (8784 data records including 5012 non-zero generation periods). It provides valuable insight to solar power variations over the course of one year. The dataset is evaluated with the transparent open box (TOB) learning network for data mining and prediction purposes. This algorithm provides accurate and repeatable MW predictions and enables detailed evaluation of the key influencing variables on each hourly data record. TOB Stage 1 applies a data matching routine driven by the squared errors between the independent variables. TOB Stage 2 applies a customized memetic firefly optimizer to minimize the root mean squared error (RMSE) for MW predictions over subsets and/or the full dataset. TOB achieves high prediction accuracy (average of five cases RMSE = 1044.4 MW; R-2 = 0.975) using tuning subsets of only similar to 303 data records (similar to 6% of the full dataset). The dataset displays some significant MW prediction outliers that are readily identified and explained individually by the TOB algorithm's data mining capabilities. A slightly filtered dataset (4918 data records excluding 94 outlier data records) improves MW prediction accuracy (average of five cases RMSE = 936.1 MW; R-2 = 0.980). Whereas the prediction outliers are readily segregated as a separate subset for more detailed evaluation. The TOB algorithm's combined machine-learning and data mining capabilities provide valuable insight to the dataset and the influences of its independent variables. The algorithm couples high-prediction accuracy and detailed evaluation of long-term and short-term time series data and for spatial scales varying from country level to individual solar farms.

AB In the current investigation, the carbon nanomaterials, mainly graphene oxide (GO), graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs), and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were added into diesel fuel, 20% (by volume) n-heptanol + 80% diesel fuel (H2OD), and 40% (by volume) n-heptanol + 60% diesel fuel (H40D) to investigate the combustion and exhaust emission characteristics of a common rail diesel engine and rapid compression-expansion machine (RCEM). The dose level of 50 mg/L of GO, GNPs, and MWCNTs was dispersed into diesel fuel, H2OD and H4OD mixtures utilizing ultrasonication system. The common rail diesel engine was operated under different loads and a fixed speed of 1000 rpm while the RCEM was run under diesel engine condition with fixed inlet air properties. The findings for H2OD and H4OD blends illustrated that the brake specific fuel consumption was increased by approximately 10%, while soot and NOx emission were reduced by about 40% and 12% respectively compared to pure diesel fuel. Moreover, the addition of carbon nanomaterials into diesel fuel, H2OD, and H4OD led to a substantial reduction in the specific fuel consumption by about 15% and the common rail engine soot emission was decreased by 60% whereas NOx was increased by 20% compared to base fuel. Combustion parameters for RCEM confirmed that there was a reduction in flame temperatures for H2OD and H4OD blends compared to diesel fuel. Additionally, there was a significant enhancement in the flame temperatures with the addition of carbon nanomaterials. According to combustion and emission results, the recommended blending ration of n-heptanol and diesel fuel is H2OD.

AB A biomass and solar energy based system consisting of a gas turbine cycle, a reheat Rankine cycle, a solar heliostat field, four-step copper-chlorine cycle and absorption cooling system is newly proposed, analyzed and comparatively evaluated through energy and exergy approaches. The proposed system is designed for the multiple useful commodities of hydrogen, electricity, hot water for fish farming and cooling. The effects of different operating conditions and parameters, namely air flow rate, biomass flow rate, working fluid flow rate, direct normal irradiance, number of heliostats, evaporator exit temperature and ambient temperature are investigated for the performance of the designed system defined in terms of energy and exergy efficiencies, and energy and exergetic coefficients of performance. The combined system, excluding solar heliostat field and absorption cooling system, is simulated using the Aspen Plus while the subsystems are modeled using the engineering equation solver package. Heating and cooling are produced for community usage, and hydrogen can be employed for industrial purposes. Both design and cost analyses are also conducted using the Aspen Plus v9 and Aspen Plus economic analyzer v9. The energy efficiency of the overall system is determined as 29.9% while the corresponding exergy efficiency is obtained to be 31.5%. The additional findings and outcomes are also presented and discussed comprehensively.

AB In this design, the swift synthesis of 5-(ethoxymethyl)furan-2-carboxaldehyde (EMF) was systematically investigated via ultrasound-assisted isomerization-dehydration-etherification of carbohydrate-derived glucose in the presence of ethanol and tetrahydrofuran as well as zinc oxide nanorod-doped sulfonic-glycerol-carbon microsphere catalyst (Zn-SO3H-GR-carbon). The catalyst was easily synthesized via in-situ hydrothermal carbonization with sulfonation and followed by trapping with zinc oxide nonorod. The physicochemical properties of assynthesized catalyst were studied in details. A combination of linear regression model with 2(k) factorial design exhibited three significant parameters for EMF production which were in the order of catalyst amount > reaction time > reaction temperature. A maximum yield of EMF (86.3%) was successfully obtained from an actual experiment with Box-Behnken design (R-2 > 0.95 and 1.3% error from quadratic regression model), providing the optimum conditions: catalyst amount (62 mg), reaction time (72 min), reaction temperature (106 degrees C) and tetrahydrofuran amount (250 mmol). Moreover, the long-term reusability for 20 cycles based on EMF yield was found in Zn-SO3H-GR-carbon catalyst after regeneration. This research was expected that all useful information for ultrasonic-assisted EMF production from glucose over efficient catalyst could be further applied in industrial practices.

AB In this study, a novel power generation cycle is presented which is a combination of the modified Kalina Cycle and the Gas Turbine-Module Helium Reactor system. The rejected heat from the GT-MHR cycle is supplied to drive the modified KC. Energy and exergy analysis is conducted applying Engineering Equation Solver (EES) software. Furthermore, concerning the mathematical modeling, the parametric study is implemented to assess the effect of the key parameters on the performance criteria of the GT-MHR with Kalina cycle. Additionally, the thermal efficiency of the system is optimized using Genetic algorithm. The result of the optimization demonstrates 53.2% for the thermal efficiency under the optimal values of 37.39% for ammonia concentration, 402 K for vapor generator temperature, 20.82 bar for vapor generator pressure, 9.582 bar for separator 2 pressure, and 2.603 for compressor pressure ratio. From the exergy analysis of the system, it is shown that the reactor core has the highest contribution to the exergy destruction rate. Although, the obtained exergy efficiency of the system is 53.2%.

AB With the issues of energy shortage and environmental pollution becoming more and more serious, renewable power generation system plays an important role in energy conservation and emission reduction. The widespread application of renewable power systems meets the requirements of current developments in China. The development of renewable power systems is still faced with a certain degree of economic and policy obstacles such as high costs and ossified subsidy, etc. China's vast territory also determines that different regions have different objective development conditions, these uncertainties are not conducive to the development of renewable power systems. In this paper, 20 cities in five typical climate zones in China were selected. In consideration of climate and electricity tariff, the technical, economic and environmental performances of three types of the community-level grid-connected renewable power prototypes are compared by a full-year simulation, including basic photovoltaic power system, wind turbine system and biogas power system. Then, a comprehensive evaluation index is developed to evaluate the energy systems potential, which integrates all the technical, economic and environmental performance indicators. The advantages and disadvantages of renewable power system development in different regions were analyzed, to provide reference for China's green development and policy-making.It is found that biogas power system has comprehensive advantages in costs and electricity production for most cities,as the comprehensive evaluation index of BG in most cities is higher than that of PV and WT. In contrast, photovoltaic power system is not an economic option for the majority of cities, except several cities where are rich in solar energy resources, such as Lhasa and Sanya.The comprehensive evaluation index of the photovoltaic system in Lhasa is 0.45, which is only lower than the wind power system in Shanghai among the 60 systems. In the southeast coastal cities with high average annual wind speed, such as Shanghai and Shenzhen, the wind power system has great potential for development. The comprehensive evaluation index of Shanghai wind power system is 0.489, which is the highest. The sensitivity analysis included in this study shows that the local grid purchase tariffs have greater impacts on systems lifetime costs than feed-in tariffs.The reduction of local grid purchase tariffs and the increase of feed-in tariffs are beneficial to the development of renewable power system.

AB The flame fuel cell is a novel kind of fuel cell that directly combines a fuel-rich flame and solid oxide fuel cells together. Because of their simple setup, low cost, quick start-up and shut-down as well as no extra thermal management, flame fuel cells have great potential in micro-combined heat and power systems and portable applications. However, the conventional solid oxide fuel cell configurations including planar ones and tubular ones, may cause some problems when used in flame fuel cells such as thermal stress, secondary flame front, and difficulty for mass production. To solve these problems, a newly developed flat-chip solid oxide fuel cell is proposed to be used in the flame fuel cell in this study. Combining the merits of both planar and tubular solid oxide fuel cells, the flat-chip fuel cell is advantageous for its simple fabrication technology, good thermal shock resistance and feasibility to scale up. A flat-chip solid oxide fuel cell is fabricated and then integrated with a catalytically enhanced porous media combustor, demonstrating a novel flat-chip flame fuel cell system. The heating time for the flat-chip solid oxide fuel cell by the fuel-rich flame is less than 10 min from room temperature to 800 degrees C, with a temperature change rate of 5 degrees C/s in the first stage. The start-up time of the flat-chip flame fuel cell is less than 10 s. When the gas velocity is 6.0 cm/s and the equivalence ratio is 2.0, a peak power density of 179 mW/cm(2) is obtained for a single cell. Although there exists a remarkable temperature gradient, a small current degradation of 0.01 A/h is observed after a constant-voltage discharging at 0.5 V for 8 hrs. In addition, the flat-chip solid oxide fuel cell can be further scaled up in dimension, resulting in higher fuel utilization of flame fuel cell.

AB Combined cooling, heating and power systems (CCHP) have received wide attention recently because of its prominent role in energy utilization. It could both decrease the energy consumption and improve the overall energy efficiency. In this paper, a novel coupled CCHP system was proposed which is composed of a conventional CCHP system, a solar thermal utilization (ST) subsystem and an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) subsystem. The CCHP-ST-ORC system has been evaluated thermodynamically, and compared with CCHP system and CCHP-ST system, which is based on the G(ICE) (rated internal combustion engine capacity) of 100 kW. Further, through the parametric study for CCHP-ST-ORC system, the effect of several operating parameters on the system thermodynamic performance is explored. Finally, a new operation strategy for CCHP-ST-ORC system was proposed and adopted in a residential building, which presents a better thermodynamic economy than CCHP-ST system. As the result, CCHP-ST-ORC system could generate an additional electricity of 5.1 kW compared with other two systems, which is at the expense of 39.3 kW heat. Further, it could expand the maximum power generation to 108 kW. The case study shows that the primary energy ratio of CCHP-ST-ORC system is 60.2% that is much higher than the 37.6% of CCHP-ST system. The results also indicate that the CCHP-ST-ORC system consumes 9.81 x 10(4)m(3)/year of natural gas, with a 12.4% reduction in energy consumption than CCHP-ST system. Therefore, these findings can promote the sustainable development of new energy utilization models, especially the coupling CCHP system.

AB Direct Steam Generation (DSG) has attracted considerable attention in comparison with conventional technologies based on Heat Transfer Fluids (HTF) for electricity generation due to its higher temperatures. In this context, a detailed numerical model has been developed, not only for comparison and assessment purposes but also for optimization analysis, in order to obtain an accurate comprehensive analysis of this type of systems.
   This paper explains in detail a numerical model developed to accurately predict the phase change and the heat transfer in the DSG Parabolic Trough Collector (PTC) system. The whole numerical model has been validated using experimental data of Direct Solar Steam (DISS) test facility from scientific literature. The model results have been compared also to the measurements of an experimental DSG PTC setup installed at Ecole Nationale d'Ingenieurs de Tunis (ENIT) running under different working and climate conditions. In all cases, both numerical results and experimental data present a reasonable agreement. The numerical code is used to perform a parametric study pointing out the influence of inlet conditions on the performance of DSG PTCs. Emphasis is placed on the determination of the optimal mass flow rate range leading to a maximum thermal efficiency of the solar collectors. Annual thermal performance of the solar collectors is featured including useful energy and thermal efficiency evaluated under Tunisian climatic conditions.

AB The increasing penetration of intermittent renewable energy into power grids calls for energy storage means to balance the electricity production and consumption. The reversible solid oxide cell is a promising technology for distributed renewable energy storage. A system-level model is a useful tool for system design and efficiency optimization. In this study, a reversible solid oxide cell system model was developed in gPROMS ModelBuilder for distributed energy storage applications by integrating a multi-scale hierarchical three-dimensional solid oxide cell stack model with zero-dimensional balance of plant components models. The hierarchical rSOC stack model considers the electrochemical reactions at the electrodes, the one-dimensional + one-dimensional thermo-fluidic transport along the thickness and the flow direction at repeating unit level, and the three-dimensional heat transfer at stack level. The proposed system model enables the simultaneous investigations on both the total system performance and detailed stack temperature distributions. The roundtrip stack efficiency and roundtrip system efficiency reached 72.3% and 58.3% respectively at base case operation conditions. The effects of excess air ratio and fuel utilization on the system efficiency as well as the temperature uniformity of the reversible solid oxide cell stack were investigated. While increasing the excess air ratio decreases stack temperature gradients, it also decreases both the stack and system roundtrip efficiency. However, improved fuel utilization decreases stack temperature gradients without affecting the stack and system roundtrip efficiency.

AB Waste-to-Energy (WtE) has started playing an increasingly important role in the recovery of energy from municipal solid waste (MSW). A number of WtE technologies are being developed. However, selecting a more environmentally sustainable option is difficult due to data limitation and methodological inconsistencies. Using life cycle assessment (LCA) as a tool, this paper aims to identify key factors influencing the potential environmental impacts of four representative WtE technologies, namely the incineration (S1), pyrolysis (S2), gasification (S3), and gasification coupled with ash melting (S4). The systems are constructed using inventory data based on on-site operation of several industrial-scale reference plants. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis is conducted, assessing a range of critical input parameters, processes, operating conditions and modelling assumptions. The results demonstrate that all analysed WtE systems exhibit environmental benefits (i.e. negative environmental impacts) for most of the impacts, while S3 seems to be more optimal due to an intermediate syngas cleaning process, which results in both reduced emissions and increased energy recovery. Parameters driving the environmental impacts are energy recovery efficiency, feedstock variability, NOx and CO2 emissions at stack, and recycling of metals. Moreover, the overall ranking of different WtE systems is strongly dependent on operating conditions, such as effectiveness of the air pollution control process, utilization pathway of pyrolysis char, and to a lesser extent, bottom ash management (landfill or recycling). The LCA modelling conditions, such as substituted source of electricity, choice of functional unit and time frame are also shown to significantly affect the quantified environmental performance. Finally, the study highlights the directions, towards which, efforts should be focused throughout all stages of each WtE technology to obtain further improvements.

AB As the development of wind power utilization, onshore wind turbines have been installed at various sites with different altitudes. Although the site-specific design is an effective way to reduce the levelized energy cost of the wind turbines, the influence of the site altitude on the energy cost is not considered in the existing site-specific designs. To fill the knowledge gap, this study presents the site-specific design optimization of the wind turbines at the high-altitude sites, based on a multi-objective trade-off between maximization of the energy production and minimization of the production cost. For this purpose, two improved estimation models of the annual energy production and the annual production cost are firstly introduced for the high-altitude wind turbines. On this basis, the multi-objective energy-cost optimization problem is formulated as two nonlinear functions relevant to two key designed parameters: the rated power and the rotor radius. After that, a multi-objective particle swarm optimization method is proposed. Finally, the proposed method is applied to the Huitengxile and Maanshan wind farms, located in Inner Mongolia and Yunnan-Kweichow plateaus of China, respectively. The results show that the energy cost has been noticeably increased by about 15% and 18% in the two applications comparing with the results ignoring the site altitude. Moreover, a trade-off between various alternative energy-cost solutions has been provided by the generated set of the optimally designed parameters. Thus, a two-step criterion has been proposed to help the turbine designers select the designed parameters according to their preference.

AB Municipal solid waste (MSW) is considered a valuable energy source that can be applied as a secondary (co-combustion) or even primary fuel in a power plant. Unfortunately, due to some formal (legislative) and technological barriers, MSW is not widely applied in the Polish energy sector. Especially, a crucial problem is the utilization of part of MSW called the over-sieve fraction (OSF). This fraction, which accounts for 30%-40% of MSW, is a by-product from the mechanical separation of MSW. Crude OSF can generate problems because it includes moisture and organic matter. Thus, it is not a stable material and can generate some technological and hygienic problems due to suppuration, unpleasant odor, and parameter changes during storage. These problems can be solved by the application of low-temperature pre-treatment of solid waste. During this process, some physical and chemical properties of crude OSF can be improved, such as calorific value, energy demand for fragmentation and milling, and property stability. The aim of this paper is to investigate the physical and chemical properties of OSF after low-temperature (150-250 degrees C) treatment. Proximate and ultimate analysis of waste after thermal pre-treatment are presented and discussed in terms of waste application as an alternative fuel in the energy sector.

AB Thermal energy storage is essential whenever there is a mismatch between the supply and consumption of energy. When the air conditioning system is applied in transport, a great challenge occurred due to frequent fluctuations of cooling load which causes comfort degradation and even healthy concern. In this study, we evaluate charging performance including charging time, transient charging rate, overall energetic and exegetic efficiency of the designed device under different operating conditions. Evolutions of PCM temperature with processing time both in the axial and radial directions are also investigated. What's more, the dynamic exergy efficiency is studied for the first time to assess the optimal charging depth and charging time. The experimental results show that the charging time can be reduced by 49% and 28% by dropping the charging temperature from 15 to 11 degrees C and increasing the inlet air velocity from 0.70 to 1.20 m/s. The designed energy storage device has flexible charging rates with the maximum value of 1.3 kJ/s, high thermal efficiencies at 87% and overall exergy efficiencies up to 70%. Both the drop of the inlet air temperature and the rise of the inlet air velocity contribute to the energy efficiency. The analysis of dynamic exergy efficiency shows that the maximum exergy efficiency can reach around 90% with the optimal charging time varying from 10 to 52 min. The corresponding optimal charging depth varies between 46% and 58% under the studied conditions. These findings could provide guidelines for the design and optimization of PCM energy storage device specifically when it is used in the transport field.

AB The extraction of the photovoltaic cells and panels parameters still represents a hot topic, despite the numerous methods proposed by researchers in scientific literature. In order to optimize the efficiency of photovoltaic cells and panels and to predict the energy they generate, it is useful to accurately calculate their parameters function of temperature and irradiance. This paper proposes the Successive discretization algorithm developed to extract five parameters of photovoltaic cells and panels using the current voltage characteristic and the one diode model. Three widely used standard datasets, one for the photovoltaic cell and two for photovoltaic panels, are utilized. Other three datasets are analyzed, one measured in laboratory conditions for the monocrystalline photovoltaic cell and two under natural sunlight for the monocrystalline photovoltaic panel. The proposed algorithm proves its performance through comparison with other over twenty accepted methods used in specialized literature. The comparison is made for five parameters and the root mean square error. The obtained results demonstrate that the method presented is one of the best and it increases the determination accuracy of important photovoltaic cells' parameters. Thus, the Successive discretization algorithm is a very good candidate as tool for extracting the photovoltaic cells and panels parameters.

AB In this study, comprehensive thermodynamic performance and economic evaluation of the ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) and wind turbine combined hybrid plant is investigated. The proposed system consists of the two main sub-cycles, which are isobutene working fluid ocean thermal energy conversion system and wind turbine. The proposed study is projected to meet the daily total electrical power demands for a petrol station on the edge of the Mediterranean Sea in Turkey (Antalya). Energetic, exergetic performances and total irreversibility as well as economic assessment of the whole plant and its components are investigated according to various factors for example dead state temperature, turbine isentropic efficiency and inlet pressure of turbine. The results obtained by calculating the effects of these parameters on the ocean thermal energy conversion - wind plant performance (energy and exergy efficiency) are presented in graphs. According to the results, the total energy and exergy efficiencies of the ocean thermal energy conversion plant are 4.49% and 14.84%, respectively. Also, the overall energy and exergy efficiency of the hybrid system are 12.27% and 23.34%, respectively. In addition, the total exergy destruction rate of the modelled plant is 2168.405 kW, and the heat exchanger has maximum exergy destruction ratio with 44.77%. Finally, the total cost of the proposed hybrid study is found as 3.03 $/hr.

AB A novel trigeneration system consisting of organic Rankine cycle (ORC) and absorption-compression cooling and power system (ACCPS) is proposed to recover diesel engine waste heat. A compressor is used between evaporator and absorber in ACCPS. Moreover, a screw expander is applied in ACCPS to increase power generation and domestic hot water (DHW) is prepared by DHW heat exchanger (HX) in ORC. Exergoeconomic analysis using the specific exergy costing (SPECO) method is implemented for system assessment. Base case and parametric analysis as well as the effects of using expander and compressor in ACCPS on total performance of the system are examined. The results show that the best thermo-economic performance of the system is achieved when ORC condensation temperature and generator outlet temperature have respectively the lowest (85 degrees C) and the highest (80 degrees C) values. It is difficult to select the proper ORC evaporation temperature, because the lower this temperature is, the higher net power output is obtained while higher ORC evaporation temperature leads to less total cost rate and more total energy efficiency of system. Moreover, system exergy efficiency has an optimum point versus variation of ORC evaporation temperature. By increasing expander inlet steam quality, ACCPS coefficient of performance (COP) and total energy efficiency of system decrease; however, due to increase in net power output and system exergy efficiency respectively equal to 18.23% and 3%, total system performance improves from exergy viewpoint. By utilizing a compressor in ACCPS and increasing its pressure ratio, the performance of ACCPS improves from energy viewpoint; however, system thermo-economic performance decreases.

AB One of the main challenges of employing lithium-ion batteries specially in large-scale applications is overheating due to the heat generation. In this work, the effect of using Potassium Polyacrylate, a superabsorbent hydrogel, on decrease in the maximum temperature inside a 500 Wh industrial pack consisting of 38,120 cells is studied. Experiments are performed for 1C and 2C discharge current rates. Due to experimental limitations, results for discharging battery pack at 3C rate are obtained by numerical simulation. Heat source term in simulation part of work is obtained based on the experimental data for different discharge rates. It was found that inserting hydrogel inside the battery pack leads to 3.9 degrees C, 7.5 degrees C and 10.9 degrees C decreases in the maximum temperature for 1C, 2C and 3C discharge rates, respectively. In addition, results revealed that the decreases in the temperature of the battery pack is considerably influenced by full filling of hydrogel at points near the edges. Moreover, the effect of distance variation between cells on the temperature distribution of the battery pack is numerically studied. The results demonstrated a significant advantage to employ hydrogel for controlling battery pack temperature compared to increasing distance between cells. Finally, to compare the effect of different parameters on the maximum temperature of battery pack, the sensitivity analysis was performed. Results showed that cell density and specific heat capacity play significant role on the pack thermal behavior.

AB Sub-Saharan African region currently suffers from the lack of clean energy and heavy postharvest loss. Hence, a biogas driven combined cooling, heating and power generation system that harmonises power generation with food drying and cold storage is studied in the context of current renewable energy policies of the Nigerian government. Wastes from a community cattle market are assessed for biogas generation that is subsequently used to power a 72 kW internal combustion engine. Heat is recovered from the engine to drive a cabinet dryer, an absorption chiller and maintain anaerobic digestion process. The model is developed in Aspen Plus and the results are used to evaluate the economic viability of the system. The electricity and tri-generation efficiencies are 25.7% and 74.5%, respectively. Results also suggest that energy demand of 407 farmers can be met including drying of 12,190 kg of cassava, 3,985 kg of maize and cold-storage of 6,080 kg of tomato per farmer every year. At $0.05.kWh(-1) of electricity, the discounted payback period varies between 2.5 and 4.7 years depending on agricultural product processed. Levelised cost of energy and profitability index are also sensitive to both interest rate and plant's availability which become uneconomical above 9% and below 80%, respectively.

AB Large amounts of fossil fuels are consumed by motor vehicles annually, and hazardous exhaust emissions from the motor vehicles have caused serious problems to environment and human health. Eco-driving can effectively improve the fuel economy and decrease the exhaust emissions, which makes it vital to analyze the fuel consumption and exhaust emissions at given driving cycle, and investigate their sensitivities to eco-driving factors. In this paper, the fuel consumption and exhaust emissions of a Euro-6 compliant light-duty diesel vehicle were tested in Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Cycles on a chassis dynamometer; further, the sensitivities of the eco-driving factors that influence the fuel economy and exhaust emissions were analyzed using validated vehicle model. For the vehicle model simulation, the effect of the coolant temperature on fuel consumption and exhaust emission only considered its effect on lubricating oil viscosity. The results showed that vehicle acceleration and velocity dominates the fuel consumption rates in Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Cycles, where more than 50% of the exhaust emissions was emitted in the first 300 s; also, fuel economy and exhaust emission factors showed a significant dependency on the road grade, coolant temperature, vehicle velocity and mass. For the driver-controllable factors, high vehicle velocity and low road grade (via route-choice) were recommended to achieve low fuel consumption and exhaust emissions.

AB Using solar-assisted absorption heat transformers to provide high-temperature process heat over 100 degrees C has raised increasing concern in recent years for its energy saving and environmentally friendly characteristics. In this study, a solar-assisted double absorption heat transformer is proposed and analyzed theoretically. The optimum off-design performance is investigated to develop high-efficient control strategies under various climatic conditions (solar radiation intensity I and ambient temperature t(amb)). In order to maximize the heating capacity and overall system thermal efficiency ((Q) over dot(h) and eta(sys)), the conjugate directions method is applied for searching the optimum operation parameters including the strong solution mass flow rate and bypass ratio ((m) over dot(sol) and BP). The results show that the eta(sys )can reach 20.3% with the heating temperature at 130 degrees C under typical climatic conditions (I = 600 W.m(-2) and t(amb) = 25 degrees C). Under off-design conditions, the (m) over dot(sol) and BP exist optimum values, at which the (Q) over dot(h) reaches the maximum value. Specifically, under typical operation conditions, the maximum (Q) over dot(h) can be obtained as the m(sol) = 90kg.h(-1) and BP = 0.8. Under higher I and t(amb) conditions, the control strategies of increasing the collector temperature and (m) over dot(sol) are very practical to enhance the system performance.

AB This paper focuses on a neural network-based structure for predicting significant unmeasurable parameters of a free-piston Stirling oscillator (FPSO). First, the nonlinear dynamic and thermodynamic equations governing a prototype FPSO are extracted. Then, a systematic approach for developing artificial neural network (ANN) is presented to predict the values of five unknown parameters considering nine measurable inputs. The critical unknown parameters include the damping coefficients of power and displacer pistons, the damping coefficient between displacer rod and power piston, and the gas temperatures within the compression and expansion spaces. Subsequently, the proposed ANN is trained and then, the regression analysis as well as the performance evaluation is carried out to validate the obtained ANN model. Furthermore, in order to verify the performance of the proposed ANN model, although limited empirical information is available, the experimental results collected from two prototype FPSOs namely SUTech-SR-1 and B10-B are compared to the ANN outcomes. Moreover, the practical P-V diagrams of the mentioned oscillators, under various realistic operating conditions, are compared to the predictions obtained from the ANN for further verification of the proposed model. Lastly, it is found that the prediction error is less than 4% which affirms the capability of the proposed technique to estimate the unmeasurable parameters of FPSOs.

AB This study aimed to investigate the symbiotic relationship of two freshwater microalgae species, Ettlia sp. and Chlorella sp. HS-2 to improve biomass productivity. The species were co-cultivated autotrophically under the inoculation ratios (Chlorella/Etdia) of 1:01, 1:04, 1:08, and 1:16. The performance of co-cultivation was compared with monoculture. It found that the co-cultivation returned higher biomass productivity (P < 0.05) than the monoculture under all inoculation ratios. The highest biomass productivity of 0.70 +/- 0.02 g L-1 day(-1) was achieved with an inoculation ratio of 1:08. The biomass productivity further increased to 0.74 +/- 0.06 g L-1 day(-1) by switching the cultivation mode to the mixotrophic condition. The biomass pro- ductivity of mixotrophic co-cultivation was higher P < 0.05 (0.74 +/- 0.06 g L-1 day(-1)) than the mixotrophic mono-culture of Ettlia (0.41 +/- 0.06 g L-1 day(-1)) but equal to mixotrophic mono-culture of Chlorella. FACS analysis revealed that the biomass obtained after co-cultivation contained 81% of Chlorella cells. In biochemical composition, co-cultivation (autotrophic) biomass contained protein 41%, carbohydrates 33%, lipids 11%, and pigments 2% of dry cell weight. The major fatty acids produced in the co-cultivation were C16-C18, which are favorable for biodiesel production. It is concluded that the co-cultivation is more favorable than the monoculture to obtain high biomass productivity and stable biomass composition.

AB Waste heat recovery from flue gas is an efficient way to increase the thermal efficiency of a gas-fired boiler. This paper proposes a novel flue gas waste heat recovery system, which comprises a condensing heat exchanger and an enthalpy wheel. The flue gas firstly flows through the condensing heat exchanger for heating boiler water, and then flows through the enthalpy wheel. The wheel, covered with desiccant material, acts as a medium for further heat and moisture transfer from the flue gas to the oxidizing air, resulting in an increase in the dew point temperature of the flue gas. Experimental results show that the average boiler efficiency reaches 106% and the average total recovery efficiency reaches 88%. The dew point temperature of the flue gas discharged from the boiler increases to around 60 degrees C, higher than that of conventional flue gas (around 55 degrees C). Consequently, more latent heat is recovered in the condensing heat exchanger by virtue of the proposed system. A mathematical model is established for further analysis based on the experimental results. The rotation speed of the enthalpy wheel and backwater temperature are key factors influencing the system performance.

AB The production of renewable chemicals and fuels is driving modern society towards a type of sustainable development which involves a decreasing dependency on fossil fuels and the minimisation of waste. Biomass, a waste by-product from the urban environment, is a carbon dioxide neutral organic fuel that can potentially serve as a feedstock for the production of sustainable power and heat. Gasification is preferred over the other thermal conversion options for biomass processing whereby the product synthesis gas can be utilised to power generators/turbines and generate clean energy, ammonia and methanol. Incidentally, efficient and economically sound biomass driven supply chains can be integrated into an existing petrochemical infrastructure. Moreover, the potential production volumes of fuels and green chemicals can also be increased by the addition of multiple biomass sources, thereby creating potential positive scale effects. This study proposes a new poly-generation process that utilises multiple sources of biomass feedstock to produce high quality urea, methanol, Fisher-Tropsch liquids and power. Four flowsheet configurations are simulated using Aspen Plus software and the builtin capabilities of the activated analysis using Aspen Process Economic Analyzer and Aspen Energy Analyzer to perform the economic, energy and environmental impact calculations. The results demonstrate that the methanol production technique is the most economic process pathway with a net profit of approximately $0.035 per kg of biomass input, whilst the urea process pathway presents the lowest environmental impact solution with approximately 0.71 kg of CO2-e per kg of biomass input. These results are relative and can be analysed from different perspectives based on the market demand of the products and their applications and local need. For instance, considering at the economic and environmental indicators relative to the production capacity, production of liquid fuels achieve net profits of approximately $0.27 per kg of product, whilst urea production demonstrates the lowest environmental emissions of approximately 3.93 kg of CO2-e per kg of product.

AB Ni-Mg-Al hydrotalcite-derived materials promoted with Ce, Zr or Fe were prepared by the co-precipitation method, which exhibited excellent performance in steam reforming of toluene (SRT) at low temperature. Especially, Fe-doped catalyst had higher catalytic activity and stability at 400 degrees C, which maintained almost 100% toluene conversion during the SRT reaction (3 h). Moreover, it also had higher hydrogen production and better selectivity for hydrogen production. The physico-chemical characterizations and model simulation indicate its high dispersion of active sites and accessibility of reactants to active sites: uniform dispersion of active sites (SEM, TEM and EDX), large specific surface area (151 m(2)/g), pore volume (0.84 cm(3)/g) and average pore diameter (22.1 nm), small crystallite size (34.9 nm), desirable Ni species reducibility (TPR), high basicity (TPD), low metal carbide formation (XPS), and good adsorption affinity with toluene (- 18.391 kJ mol(-1), DFT). Moreover, less carbon was deposited on the Fe-containing catalyst through measuring the amorphous carbon and CNTs by the TG-MS method, which was due to the tip-growth mechanism of CNTs. Considering lower toluene conversion temperature, higher hydrogen yield, and better resistance to carbon deposition, this study may be meaningful in development of SRT at low temperature.

AB Based on the current economic and environmental analysis of the textile waste streams, textile waste alone can be a promising source of renewable energy. To realize that, catalyst-supported pyrolysis was used in the present research to treat textile waste and convert it into value-added energy carriers while attempting to minimize consumption of consumable chemicals (catalysts) and pyrolysis time and maximize the yield of valuable bio-oil and gases (Methane and Hydrogen). Pyrolysis was conducted on waste jeans (a major fraction of textile waste, rich in cellulose/cotton) with different dye colors (black and blue) and dye-originating heavy metals (used as a self-catalysts). Waste jeans of both colors were pyrolyzed in original condition and after acid leaching to remove the heavy metals for comparison. Also, the pyrolysis experiments were performed according to Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) concept, particularly in laboratory and pilot scale phases. At the first phase, Differential thermal analysis/Thermogravimetric analysis/3D-Fourier-Transform Infrared spectroscopy was employed to simulate the pyrolysis on a lab scale (fundamental level of TRL) and study the thermal and chemical decomposition of the selected samples up to 800 degrees C. At the second stage, a pilot pyrolysis plant was built (based on the fundamental results received from lab scale) to simulate the industrial energy conversion conditions and obtain the data needed to apply the developed approach at industrial scale. The developed plant consisted of four units: pyrolysis reactor (capacity 300 g, Nitrogen ambient, and max. temp. 800 degrees C), gas purification unit, instantaneous gas composition analysis unit (to study the effect of pyrolysis temperature on the generated Oxygen, Nitrogen, Carbon Monoxide, Carbon dioxide, Methane, and Hydrogen gases), and gas products collection unit. The pyrolysis products were analyzed using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry, Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and Scanning Electron Microscope- Energy-dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy. The results showed that the developed technology successfully converted more than 82% of the feedstock into liquidgas products and that the untreated feedstock had effective bio-oil yield 36-37.6% (depending on the composition of self-catalysts), which was similar to 20% higher compared to the treated batches; 18% reduction in pyrolysis time of untreated feedstock was achieved as well.

AB Fifth generation district heating and cooling networks are characterized by supply temperatures in the ambient range of 15-25 degrees C, which not only reduces heat loss but also allows for integrating various kinds of low-temperature waste heat sources. The ability of these networks to absorb waste heat that is normally unrecoverable makes them an attractive solution for the future energy supply of urban areas. To enhance the adoption of these networks, this paper describes the development of a software tool to analyze the feasibility of fifth-generation of district heating and cooling systems in both new and existing districts. The research attempts to answer the question: "Which buildings should be connected to a low-temperature hydraulic network given both the incremental benefits and costs relative to the scenario of decentralized (dedicated) heating and cooling systems for each building?" Therefore, all possible network layouts of the buildings are considered where the heating and cooling demands of each building are met by the fifth-generation of district heating and cooling network. For the heating and cooling load characterization of the buildings, reduced-order models are used while renewable energy and waste heat sources are included in the network. The focus of the research lies in the development of a hydraulic model for flexible use in the urban energy modeling and the optimization of the fifth-generation of district heating and cooling network topology for a given urban district. Simulation results quantify the performance of the fifth-generation of district heating and cooling network based on various output metrics, including primary energy usage, carbon dioxide emissions, and network implementation cost.

AB The influence of structural vibrations on piezoelectric energy harvesters' performance is already documented in the literature. Testing of cantilevered type piezoelectric transducers was performed in this work, which confirmed that the voltage output of the piezo-film transducers largely used in studies assuming flow-induced excitation is affected by structural vibrations transported to its base. Aiming to exclude the base vibration effect, two piezoelectric energy harvesting (PEH) test rigs isolated from structural vibrations were constructed and tested at the Laboratory of Fluid Mechanics and Turbomachinery in the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (LFMT, AUTh). In both cases plastic attachments were mounted on the piezo-films to increase their voltage output range. The first set up created air flow excitation using a low power axial fan (set up A) and the second using a centrifugal fan (set up B). The Reynolds numbers ranged at 5000-110,000. The maximum swirl number was 0.5 in both set ups. Traverse mechanisms were employed to study the effect of the harvesters' distance from the source of excitation on their power output. Both harvesters demonstrated higher power outputs for higher fan speeds. The power output of the harvesters was found to increase with the increase of the voltage root mean square (rms) value. The maximum power harvested was 3.75 mu W and it was observed at the highest fan speed of set up B.

AB An adjustable ejector with a needle is deemed as an effective device to improve the performance of the transcritical CO2 refrigeration cycle with a wide operating conditions. In this paper, a homogeneous CFD model is built up to compare the performance of the adjustable and fixed ejectors with the same key structural sizes. By validating the numerical results with the experimental data, the k-epsilon RNG and k-epsilon Realizable are considered to predict the performance of the CO2 ejector well. Furthermore, an exergy analysis model is proposed to obtain the exergy fluxes of the primary and secondary flows are obtained, respectively. The results discover that the main exergy transfer (interaction between the primary and secondary flows) locates in the suction chamber. Meanwhile, the higher exergy loss is observed in the suction chamber of the adjustable ejector due to flow separation along the needle and higher viscous dissipation of oblique shock wave, which results in 5%-11% lower entrainment ratio than that of the fixed ejector. However, the higher velocity in the fixed ejector results in higher friction of the wall and more intense flow separation in the diffuser which causes higher exergy loss in the mixer and diffuser. Accordingly, the exergy efficiency of the adjustable ejector is only 0.5% lower than that of the fixed ejector. In spite of the special case in this paper, the adjustable ejector is considered to be able to achieve a similar exergy efficiency with the fixed ejector.

AB Bentonite/zeolite-P composite (B/ZP) was synthesized by simple alkaline hydrothermal treatment at 150 degrees C for 4 h and characterized by different analytical techniques. The composite was introduced as a low-cost catalyst of enhanced physiochemical properties and catalytic activity in the transesterification of palm oil into biodiesel. The catalytic activity of B/ZP catalyst was inspected by normal stirring mixing and under ultrasonic irradiation of different powers (20-60%). The best biodiesel yield by normal stirring (96.2%) was achieved at operating conditions of 210 min as conversion time, 20:1 as a methanol-to-oil molar ratio, 5 wt% as a catalyst loading, 90 degrees C as temperature and 900 rpm as stirring speed. The conversion reaction under the ultrasonic irradiation (power 60%) gives biodiesel yield of 98.8% after 120 min as reaction time using 5 wt% as catalyst loading, 20:1 as a methanol-to-oil ratio, and 90 degrees C as temperature. The ultrasonic irradiation is of positive impacts in reducing the conversion time interval, reaction temperature, catalyst loading, and methanol-to-oil molar ratio with biodiesel yield similar to that obtained by normal stirring at its best conditions. The catalyst is of higher activities than several homogenous and heterogeneous catalysts and can be reused several times with high catalytic activity especially using an organic solvent either by normal stirring or under the ultrasonic irradiation. The physicochemical specification of the obtained biodiesel by both methods matches the requirements of STM D-6571 and EN 14214 international standards.

AB A novel bioenergy-producing green alga (lab ID.: XNY8011) was isolated from a local mountain in Beijing, China, and was identified as a strain belonging to the genus of Coelastrum on the basis of morphological and molecular characterization. Physiological analyses of photobiological H-2 and lipid production suggested that XNY8011 could be a candidate for biofuels production. This strain could accumulate considerable biomass and produce massive chlorophylls in water diluted waste molasses. Three concentrations of molasses (0.1, 0.2 and 0.5%, w/v) were studied to optimize the cell growth and chlorophylls synthesis of XNY8011, and 0.2% was proved to be the optimum, in which XNY8011 could reach A600 of 1.55 +/- 0.06 and produce 11.35 +/- 0.93 mu g/mL of chlorophylls. It was found that 25 degrees C is the most preferable temperature for the cell growth of XNY8011 in molasses. Interestingly, the strain XNY8011 exhibited significant low temperature adaptability when growing in waste molasses compared to typical bioenergy green algae. It produced 5.73 and 3.05 folds of cell densities in molasses than that Chlamydomonas reinhardtii CC503 and Chlorella vulgaris did under 20 degrees C, respectively, and even obtained 13.51 and 2.72 folds of cell densities under 15 degrees C, respectively. The dynamic analysis suggested that the sugar in waste molasses was utilized as carbon source for cell growth and biomass accumulation. The present study isolated a novel bioenergy-producing green alga from the native environment which could convert waste molasses to biomass and bioenergy with significant temperature adaptability.

AB Fast co-pyrolysis of bamboo sawdust and waste plastic (linear low-density polyethylene, LLDPE) over a dual catalytic stage of synthesized CeO2/gamma-Al2O3 and HZSM-5 was conducted to enhance aromatic hydrocarbons production. Experimental results indicated that the catalyst to biomass (C/B) mass ratio played a determining role in the formation of hydrocarbon intermediates and a C/B mass ratio of 4 facilitated the production of aromatic hydrocarbons. Dual catalytic fast co-pyrolysis of bamboo sawdust and LLDPE using synthesized CeO2/gamma-Al2O3 and HZSM-5 increased the concentration of aromatic hydrocarbons and a CeO2/gamma-Al2O3 to HZSM-5 mass ratio of 1:3 maximized the target products. The content of aromatic hydrocarbons was increased at first and then decreased as the LLDPE percentage was elevated from 20% to 100% during the dual catalytic fast co-pyrolysis process, with the highest concentration obtained at 75% LLDPE percentage. In addition, the additive effect of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons was enhanced with the increasing of LLDPE percentage in the feedstock blends, and higher LLDPE proportion favored the production of xylenes, ethylbenzene, and alkylbenzenes as the additive effects were significantly promoted.

AB Multi-functional energy systems incorporating renewable energy are a promising solution to mitigate fossil energy consumptions and environmental pollution. To satisfy the seasonal clean heating demand in cold regions of Northern China, a novel multi-functional system with input sources of solar energy and biomass and output products of power, heating and hydrogen is proposed. The system takes advantage of the complementary properties of solar-driven biomass gasification, concentrated solar energy is stored as chemical energy in the form of syngas, which gains a significant upgrade regarding the energy level. The gasified syngas is used to produce power and heating via a power cycle unit during the heating periods and to produce hydrogen via a water-gas shift reactor during the non-heating periods. The design and off-design thermodynamic performances of the system are numerically studied with a focus on time-varying heating loads. The system achieves a primary energy efficiency of 44.26% and the power to heat ratio is 69.98% under the designed conditions. The primary energy efficiency is insensitive to the intermittency of solar energy as a result of the introduction of a chemical energy storage module. The annual average hydrogen production efficiency of the system reaches 64.97%. The proposed multi-functional energy system achieves favorable thermodynamic performances and provides an attractive option for efficient utilization of abundant solar and biomass resources in China.

AB Obtaining accurate wind speed forecast result plays a decisive role in ensuring the reliable operation of the power system integrated with large-scale wind power. Deep learning methods are increasingly being used to predict wind speed, which have relatively high prediction accuracy but more time-consuming training processes. The purposes of this study are further to improve the prediction accuracy of the wind speed and reduce the training time of the deep learning method. In this paper, a novel hybrid model, New Cell Update Long Short-Term Memory combined with Empirical Wavelet Transform, is proposed to increase the prediction accuracy in shorter training time. At first, the original wind speed sequence is preprocessed into a series of sub-sequence by the empirical wavelet decomposition. Then each sub-sequence is trained by New Cell Update Long Short-Term Memory which is proposed by this paper respectively and the sum of each sub-sequence is treated as the final prediction results. In order to verify the performance of the proposed model, different decomposition methods and different prediction methods are compared on the four actual wind speed prediction cases in the Inner Mongolia, China from prediction accuracy and training time. The results demonstrate that: (1) New Cell Update Long Short-Term Memory network has slightly higher prediction accuracy and shorter training time than Long Short-Term Memory network. (2) The prediction accuracy of the model is significantly improved after empirical wavelet decomposition. Therefore, New Cell Update Long Short-Term Memory network combined with empirical wavelet decomposition is a competitive wind speed prediction method compared to the existing state-ofthe-art approach.

AB Sensible heat transportation with water is widely adopted in traditional heating network, which suffers from the low energy transportation density and inevitable heat loss for long-distance heat transportation. To address these two issues, the solution transportation absorption system has been proposed, which transports the thermal energy by stable chemical potential. However, boundary between the two technologies is not clear due to the lack of direct comparison on both technological and economic aspects. In this work, feasibility analysis of the solution transportation absorption system is performed using Aspen plus, and low ambient temperature is considered for a practical scenario. Economic contrast is performed by exergoeconomic analysis. Results show that the coefficient of performance and exergy efficiency of the solution transportation absorption system can reach 0.556 and 24.6% in optimal condition. The energy transportation density is nearly three times higher than that of traditional sensible heat transportation. Moreover, the exergoeconomic analysis indicates that the new system is more economical when the distance exceeds 6 km. It has been proved that the solution transportation absorption system is a feasible and economical way to efficiently transport thermal energy over long distance.

AB The main Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plants type installed worldwide corresponds to parabolic trough (PT) technology transforming solar energy into thermal energy on the receiver tubes. The use of alternative Heat Transfer Fluids (HTF) in order to increase the solar-to-electric efficiency by means of either higher HTF temperatures or the use of supercritical cycles have opened a new line of research. In this framework, super-critical carbon dioxide (sCO(2)) seems to be a good candidate to replace current HTFs in PTs. This work implements a one-dimensional heat transfer model for a PT solar collector considering different HTFs such as synthetic oil, sub-critical carbon dioxide, and sCO(2). The numerical results of the outlet fluid temperature are compared to experimental data and numerical results published in the literature, obtaining maximum temperature deviations of 0.9%, 2.9% and 2.7% respectively. Finally, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate the influence of the solar irradiation, mass flow rate and HTF inlet temperature on the thermal performance of a PT working with sCO(2) showing that the solar irradiation produces the greatest variations.

AB Heterogeneous acid catalysts derived from acai stone (Euterpe oleracea Mart), a large-scale residue biomass, were synthesized by partial carbonization followed by sulfonation within a short preparation time under controllable conditions. Their catalytic activity was tested in the esterification reaction of oleic acid with alcohols, with varying chain-lengths, and with a modified edible oil with high fatty acid content. The sulfonated carbon materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy coupled with an EDS system for elemental mapping (SEM-EDS), thermogravimetry (TG), infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), low-temperature N-2 sorption, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The reaction conditions and catalyst preparation were systematically investigated with respect to carbonization and sulfonation temperatures, reaction temperature and time, reactants' molar ratio, catalyst loading, alcohol type, and recyclability. A low carbonization temperature created carbon materials with surface features that favored the anchoring of sulfonic groups, in turn providing desirable sulfonation under mild temperatures. After optimization of the reaction conditions, a yield of 93% was obtained when 5% catalyst loading was used to convert a 1:12 oleic acid to methanol molar ratio at 100 degrees C for 1 h. Comparatively, the uncatalyzed reaction yielded only 11% conversion. The sulfonated carbon catalyst was tested in the esterification of soybean oil that was modified with 20% oleic acid to reduce the quality of feedstock and simulate harsh conditions; the catalyzed reaction showed yields up to 80%. Moreover, the synthesized catalyst was stable for up to three reaction cycles, displaying a decrease in efficiency of only 8%. This study shows promising results for obtaining sulfonated carbon catalysts from acai stone biomass, thereby potentially solving one of the major environmental problems in the Amazon region and providing a sustainable alternative for fuel production.

AB This study aims to investigate techno-economic benefits of biomass retrofit for practical concentrated solar power (CSP) organic Rankine cycle (ORC) power plants. In this regard, technical parameters of an existing CSP-ORC plant currently running in Ottana (Italy) have been adopted for analyses. The plant consists of linear Fresnel collectors solar field, coupled with a two-tank oil-based thermal energy storage (TES) device, feeding a 630 kWe ORC plant. Fixed and modular biomass hybridization approaches were proposed for retrofit. In the fixed approach, biomass furnace constantly supplies thermal energy to ORC such that a pre-determined minimum power production is guaranteed, with or without solar thermal energy availability. In the modular approach, biomass furnace is regulated to supply balance thermal energy needed to continuously operate the ORC at its full capacity. Furthermore, beyond the biomass retrofit case study, a newly integrated design case study was introduced, with modified solar field and TES capacity. By using the meteorological conditions of Ottana, results of techno-economic performance for the retrofit case study showed that annual net electrical efficiency increases by 4-5 percent points, relative to the solar-only ORC plant. Marginal levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of between 103 (sic)/MWh and 109 (sic)/MWh were obtained. Also, marginal net present value (NPV) ranges from 1.83 M(sic) to 3.22 M(sic). For the newly integrated design case study, results showed that design case with modular hybridization approach represents the highest annual net electrical efficiency, at 19.8%. For this approach, economic results showed that LCOE ranges between 130 (sic)/MWh and 146 (sic)/MWh. Beyond current state-of-the-art, the results obtained in this study show that biomass retrofit for existing CSP-ORC plants can lead to higher full-load operation hours and more prospective plant economics. Moreover, the implemented modular approach enables scheduled power profile to be followed, thereby enhancing plant dispatchability.

AB Highly efficient methanization of sewage sludge has been a long-standing challenge. Therefore, in this study, hyperthermophilic (70 degrees C) biological hydrolysis pretreatment was investigated as a strategy to improve sludge biodegradability when subsequently combined with an anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR). Its effects on organics removal, methane yield, microbial community structure and activity were studied at hydraulic retention times (HRTs) ranging from 5 to 20 days. The results obtained from the 170-day continuously fed experiment showed a high methane yield, ranging from 176 to 246 L/kg-VSin the AnMBR by feeding the pretreated sludge at a constant HRT of 5 days. High removal efficiencies of volatile solids ranging from 46% to 63% occurred in the AnMBR. A satisfactory net energy output was also obtained. Methanothermobacter dominated the AnMBR and was robust to the HRT changes. Severe membrane fouling occurred after 140 days under a high solid concentration. Subsequently, chemical cleaning (NaClO and citric acid) successfully recovered the flux and permeability of the membrane. Conclusively, this study lays the foundation for using hyperthermophilic hydrolysis in the mechanization of sludge through integration with AnMBR technology.

AB A hybrid solar power generation system integrating a concentrating photovoltaic, direct steam generation solar collector with a chemical heat pump is proposed in this study. In the hybrid system, the chemical heat pump is used to chemically upgrade the dissipated heat of the concentrating photovoltaic. The upgraded heat, together with the heat from the direct steam generation solar collector, is applied to drive the high-parameter steam Rankine cycle for efficient power generation. The performance of the hybrid system was examined first, and it was found that the solar-to-electric efficiency of the hybrid system is more than 20% higher than that of the individual systems of concentrating photovoltaic and direct steam generation solar power generation systems. The influence of chemical heat pump on the performance of the hybrid system is analysed, and the efficiency of the hybrid system reaches the maximum (34.71%) when the exothermic temperature of the chemical heat pump equals 360 degrees C. The dissipated heat of the concentrating photovoltaic can be chemically stored in the chemical heat pump. This enables the hybrid system to generate electricity continuously. The performance of the hybrid system in a typical day is compared with the concentrating photovoltaic individual system. The result shows that, benefitting from better performance and energy storage, the average electricity output per aperture area of the hybrid system (192.36 Wm(-2)) is approximately 170% higher than that of individual system of concentrating photovoltaic (70.41 Wm(-2)). Integrating the dissipated heat of concentrating photovoltaic into a high efficiency cycle via the chemical heat pump, this work would provide a potential approach for utilizing solar energy efficiently.

AB The proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) stacks are not widely utilized in the sector of the transportation industry, due to their limited efficiency and durability. In order to apply FC stacks in high-power occasions, the FC stacks are usually connected in parallel to form a multi-stack FC system (MFCS). During the operation, since the current from the stacks changes dynamically with different operating parameters, they usually present different performance. In the MFCS, if the performance of one stack is unsatisfactory, operating the underperforming stack without corresponding protection measures may further degrade its performance and thus break down the system. In order to slow down the performance degradation of the FC stacks and keep the consistency of stacks' performance in MFCS, this paper has considered the effects of different stacks operating state and membrane area on the output current variations of stacks. And then an adaptive current distribution method realized by virtual droop technique considering the performance consistency of FC is proposed. Besides, this study builds a parallel-connected PEMFC generation system to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The validity of the proposed method has been demonstrated with experimental results. In addition, compared with the conventional control algorithm, the presented virtual droop control algorithm could get more satisfactory results. Such as improving the load voltage regulation and reducing the magnitude of the deviation between the actual output current and the reference current.

AB The high operation cost of the EV charging station (EVCS) is a severe challenge for the development of electric vehicles, which lead to the general shortage of the EVCS. In order to reduce the operation costs of the EVCS, an approximate dynamic programming (ADP) based energy management system (EMS) is proposed for the EVCS equipped with multiple types of chargers (EVCS-MTC). A fuzzy logic guiding system has been designed to allocate each vehicle an appropriate charging spot based on its charging urgency. Multiple EVs can acquire the charging service through a common charger in the EVCS-MTC. In the proposed EMS, the approximate dynamic programming (ADP) and the evolution algorithm (EA) are combined to determine the optimal charging start time for each EV. This characteristic provides the charging device with the maximum autonomy to select the preferred flexible charging pattern, which can prolong the battery lifetime and reduce the communication requirements of the control system. With taking the dynamic electricity price and uncertain future charging demand into account, the proposed EMS can achieve a total cost reduction of over 50% compared with the conventional charging scheme in the numerical studies.

AB Resource efficiency is a key component of sustainable policies and practices, particularly in industries with high energy demands. Using empirical data, this paper evaluates the long-term performance (1960-2009) of the United Kingdom steel sector through the exergy-based metrics of "resource efficiency" and "useful exergy efficiency". The analysis is broken down into two production pathways: the basic oxygen furnace and the electric arc furnace. The scope includes electricity generation and steel refining. It incorporates energy and material inputs, as well as by-products as useful outputs. The exergy-based indicators demonstrate the benefit of measuring both the quality and quantity of resources. The results are contextualised to gain insights into the long-term impact of political and socioeconomic transitions on resource consumption trends. Over the period, the sector's overall resource efficiency went from 19% to 32%. Between 2% and 4% of this improvement results from the reincorporation of by-products into production processes. The basic oxygen furnace route's resource efficiency increased by 9% whilst the electric arc furnace route rose by 20%. These improvements occurred via the promotion of successful energy saving policies rather than the diversion of large amounts of scrap inputs into the furnaces. This paper shows that both the resource efficiency and useful exergy efficiency indicators are a valuable complement to the benchmark metrics (energy intensity and material efficiency). This is because they can quantify the interactions and trade-offs between energy and material flows.

AB Layout optimization is a critical step in constructing and operating wind power plants. The layout optimization strongly depends on the wake spatial evolution and on wake interactions within the wind farm. In this study, the power performance of a minimal wind turbine array was investigated in an atmospheric boundary layer wind tunnel. Five turbine configurations were tested in site-specific experiments: a single turbine, two aligned turbines, two misaligned turbines, three aligned turbines, and three misaligned turbines. Along with angular velocity and power measurements, a Constant Temperature Anemometer (CTA) cross-wire probe collected the downstream wake velocity data. The results show that the operating configuration of the upstream turbine significantly affects the power of the total wind turbine array, inducing the optimal tip speed ratios of the downstream turbines in the wake to decrease. To improve the power performance of the turbine array, introducing a spanwise offset is more beneficial than increasing the streamwise distance between turbines. The wake interaction between upstream turbines results in a larger wake expansion, leading to a reduction in the power produced by downstream turbines in the array. In addition, the most downstream turbine can be observed to have a better performance than its upstream turbine in an aligned three-turbine array. Balancing these effects is critical in the optimization strategy of wind farm layout.

AB The electrical demand of isolated regions without connection to the main grid is usually satisfied by a diesel generator. By replacing this conventional system with a hybrid renewable energy system (HRES) including renewable power generators and battery system, the initial cost increases due to additional components. The operating cost, in contrast, can be reduced by minimizing fuel consumption. The economic viability of HRES, therefore, is heavily dependent on both component sizing and energy dispatch strategy. In order to calculate the minimal operating cost, the control trajectory has to be optimized for each design. Within the common publications, the optimal design is not determined based on optimal control trajectory, but using simple rule-based (RB) or advanced RB control. Furthermore, the correlation between component sizing and economic performance is not identified clearly. In this paper, the complete design space for HRES is explored by dynamic programming (DP) based optimal control. In this way, it is guaranteed that the economic performance of each design is deduced from its full potential and the fair comparison among different designs is enabled. The economic performance is evaluated based on four economic parameters including initial cost, operating & maintenance cost, life cycle cost (LCC), and the payback time (PBT). Based on simulation results using DP, the influence of component sizing on each economic parameter is systematically studied. The simulation results show the overall economic performance is determined by the size of renewable power generator and battery storage, whereby diesel generator plays a minor role. Since the LCC and PBT are dominated by initial cost rather than operating cost, small component sizes are preferred minimizing the wasted dump power. Finally, the impact of energy dispatch strategy is investigated by comparing DP based optimal control with simple RB and advanced RB control. Although the loss of optimality using advanced RB control is negligible within 3%, the application of simple RB control suffers from an optimality loss of 7-16%.

AB Decreasing initial costs, the increased availability of charging infrastructure and favorable policy measures have resulted in the recent surge in plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) ownerships. PEV adoption increases electricity consumption from the grid that could either exacerbate electricity supply shortages or smooth demand curves. The optimal coordination and commitment of power generation units while ensuring wider access of PEVs to the grid are, therefore, important to reduce the cost and environmental pollution from thermal power generation systems, and to transition to a smarter grid. However, flexible demand side management (DSM) considering the stochastic charging behavior of PEVs adds new challenges to the complex power system optimization, and makes existing mathematical approaches ineffective. In this research, a novel parallel competitive swarm optimization algorithm is developed for solving large-scale unit commitment (UC) problems with mixed-integer variables and multiple constraints - typically found in PEV integrated grids. The parallel optimization framework combines binary and real-valued competitive swarm optimizers for solving the UC problem and demand side management of PEVs simultaneously. Numerical case studies have been conducted with multiple scales of unit numbers and various demand side management strategies of plug-in electric vehicles. The results show superior performance of proposed parallel competitive swarm optimization based method in successfully solving the proposed complex optimization problem. The flexible demand side management strategies of plug-in electric vehicles have shown large potentials in bringing considerable economic benefit.

AB Fault diagnosis of photovoltaic array plays an important role in operation and maintenance of PV power plant. The nonlinear characteristics of photovoltaic array and the Maximum Power Point Tracking technology in the inverter prevent conventional protection devices to trip under certain faults which reduces the system's efficiency and increases the risks of fire hazards. In order to better diagnose photovoltaic array faults under Maximum Power Point Tracking conditions, the sequential data of transient in time domain under faults are analyzed and then applied as the input fault features in this work. Firstly, the sequential current and voltage of the photovoltaic array are transformed into a 2-Dimension electrical time series graph to visually represent the characteristics of sequential data. Secondly, a Convolutional Neural Network structure comprising nine convolutional layers, nine max-pooling layers, and a fully connected layer is proposed for the photovoltaic array fault diagnosis. The proposed model for photovoltaic array fault diagnosis integrates two main parts, namely the feature extraction and the classification. Thirdly, this model automatically extracts suitable features representation from raw electrical time series graph, which eliminates the need of using artificially established features of data and then employs for photovoltaic fault diagnosis. Moreover, the proposed Convolutional Neural Network based photovoltaic array fault diagnosis method only takes the array of voltage and current of the photovoltaic array as the input features and the reference panels used for normalization. The proposed approach of photovoltaic array fault diagnosis achieved over 99% average accuracy when applied to the case studies. The comparisons of the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is both effective and reliable.

AB In this paper, the impact of on-off cycling losses on the seasonal energy performances of three reversible air-to-water heat pumps having equivalent thermal performance at full load but different power modulation capacity is discussed by means of a series of dynamic simulation models. The analysis of the heat pump performance at partial load, the development and comparison of different control algorithms for heat pumps and, finally, the modeling and evaluation of the degradation effect due to the heat pump on-off cycles at partial load conditions are numerically investigated by means of a series of innovative TRNSYS models not available in the software standard library. The models are able to take into account the variation of the heat pump performance at partial load conditions for multi-stage, inverter-driven and single-stage devices. The findings of this paper point out that the energy losses introduced during the start-up transient of the heat pump has a significant impact on the overall energy performance of the system only for single-stage units, which perform on-off cycles during the whole season, with a decrease of the seasonal performance factor (SPF) up to 12%. On the other hand, modulating heat pumps (i.e. multi-stage and inverter-driven units) avoid carrying out on-off cycles and, of course, cycling losses for a significant part of the season according to their enhanced modulation capacity. It is shown how the accurate dynamic simulation of heat pump-based systems is a useful tool for HVAC designers in order to optimize their control system parameters, with the aim to reduce the compressor maximum hourly number of cycles.

AB Substituting conventional fossil-based energy with eco-friendly and renewable option is inevitable owing to the harmful environmental emissions and steep increase in energy demand. In this context, biodiesel is a clean fuel considering fewer particulate and carbon emissions in comparison to fossil fuels. However, it still faces concerns towards commercialization due to the high cost of raw materials. Thus, in this study, laccase treated waste liquor of Ricinus communis was utilized for lipid production employing Aspergillus awamori. Detailed characterization of laccase treated waste liquor of Ricinus communis revealed that it is favourable for fungal lipid production owing to C/N molar ratio of 132.45 and phenolic content of 0.609 g Gallic Acid Equivalent per L. Major components of phenolics include cinnamic acid, 3-Bromo-5-ethoxy-4-hydroxybenzaldehyde and benzoic acid. Central composite design based response surface methodology was further adopted to maximize lipid content where optimal solution was predicted as 31 degrees C, carbon to nitrogen molar ratio 156 and inoculum volume 11.5% v/v resulting in 134 mg lipid/g sugar consumed. Further, validation of the process was carried out at pilot scale to justify the feasibility of the process and its applicability for industrial application. Biodiesel, thus produced was characterized for iodine value, acid value and gross calorific value which has been measured to be 73.68 g /100 g, 0.25 mg KOH/g and 37 MJ/kg respectively and conforms to EN 14214 and ASTM D6751. Thus, the present study led to the development of an efficient and clean process for valorization of laccase treated Ricinus communis waste liquor towards biodiesel production.

AB Even with the expeditious progress in global Photovoltaic (PV) power generation, faults occurring in PV systems pose excessive challenges to the productivity and reliability of PV installations. Though specific installation standards have been developed for the protection of PV systems, the compatibility of these standards to cope with the unique operating characteristics of PV generating systems is questionable and hence, needs critical evaluation. Therefore, this paper briefly analyzes the standards available for the protection of PV systems, investigates the protection challenges and inspects the compatibility of latest National Electric Code (NEC) standards to protect PV arrays against Line-Line (LL) and Line-Ground (LG) fault occurrences. In particular, this article conducts a detailed behavioral study on LL and LG faults and evaluates the compatibility of NEC standards in the context of: (1) Varying mismatch levels, (2) Impact of Maximum Power Point Trackers (MPPTs) and (3) Changing irradiation levels. Detailed simulations as well as experimental analysis have been carried out to clearly portray the challenges in LL/LG fault detection despite by following new NEC recommendations. Further, based on the implications attained, some suggestions for reliable fault detection have also been presented that are expected to enhance the reliability of LL/LG fault detection in PV systems.

AB Water and energy supply are two of the key issues human beings must address to attain sustainable development. Humidification-dehumidification technology has been proven to be a cost-effective approach to fulfill the freshwater demand. Particular attention has been given to coupling the humidification-dehumidification cycles with refrigeration, power and other desalination technologies with the aim of enhancing the performance of the combined cycle as well as increasing the amount of produced freshwater, cooling effect, power, etc. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art investigations in terms of humidification-dehumidification technologies and their integration with the aforementioned cycles. In other words, an attempt has been made to categorize and discuss the various combined cycles based on humidification-dehumidification technology. A detailed comparison has been drawn regarding the performance criteria of the coupled cycles in terms of freshwater production, gained output ratio, and cost per liter. This comprehensive review lays the groundwork for future research concentrating on humidification-dehumidification based energy cycles.

AB The organic Rankine cycle has been widely explored for energy recovery from several heat sources. In this paper, the maximization of the energy recovery of the exhaust gases from the General Electric LM 2500 gas turbines in a floating production offloading unit is studied in order to meet the demands of heat (pressurized hot water) and electricity over oil production lifetime. An off-design model of the system is developed to check the viability of an organic Rankine cycle under dynamic operating conditions. Energy and exergy analysis of the proposed system are conducted to determine main irreversibilities and performance characteristics of the system and, finally, the economic benefits of the energy recovery system application are discussed. The organic Rankine cycle is very flexible in the heat recovery in dynamic demand conditions, contributing up to 20.3% in electricity generation, which causes an increase in overall system efficiency of up to 11.3% and up to 18.3% in the utilization factor, as well as an average reduction of 22.0% in carbon dioxide emissions in the floating production offloading unit electricity generation process. The exergy efficiency of the system reaches 55.8% and the heat recovery devices are the most irreversible equipment in organic Rankine cycle, contributing up to 68% of the total exergy destroyed. The economic analysis demonstrated the attractiveness of the organic Rankine cycle implementation, allowing a net present value to Brazil's current economic scenario of up to USD 16.8 million.

AB This paper shows, for the first time, the optimisation of the electrical supply in off-grid systems by means of hybrid renewable systems (photovoltaic + wind + battery + fossil fuel) including thermoelectric generator (which source of heat is the exhaust gas of a stove used for cooking or heating).
   The objective is to minimise the net present cost. An advanced battery model and the accurate calculation of the net present cost (including all the costs during the system lifetime) are considered in the optimisation of this kind of systems. The standard simplified model of the thermoelectric generator is used, as more complex models cannot be used in an optimisation framework, where hundreds or thousands of different cases must be simulated (each combination of components must be simulated at least during one year, in 1-min steps). The optimization is carried out efficiently by means of genetic algorithms.
   The method has been applied in the optimisation of two cases of low consumption off-grid households (Cambodia and Norway). Thermoelectric generator (costing (sic)8/W) is part of the optimal solution in the case of Norway. In Cambodia, to be part of the optimal system, acquisition cost of the thermoelectric generator should be reduced by 25%.

AB The primary goal of this study is to determine the minimum cost of energy (COE) for five different global locations - Squamish, Canada; Los Angeles and Golden, USA; and Brisbane and Adelaide, Australia - based on renewable energy systems. We do this by investigating power generation and hydrogen production via renewable energy resources (mainly solar and wind) to produce synthetic fuels by capturing CO2 from the atmosphere. Nine different renewable energy systems are considered based on photovoltaic (PV), wind turbines (WT) and combinations thereof, including battery banks and hydrogen technologies. We used the Hybrid Optimization Model for Multiple Energy Resources (HOMER Pro) microgrid software to simulate the optimum size of system components and to identify the cost-effective configurations based on particular locations. When considering minimum COE, the results show that integration of PV, WT, a battery bank, an electrolyser and a hydrogen tank are at 0.50 $/kWh at Golden, Colorado, USA. We also found that without a battery bank, the minimum COE is 0.78 $/kWh at the same location. In this case, the cost increase is due to the capital cost of system components, mainly the hydrogen technologies. The results of this study suggest that hydrogen has economic benefits over batteries for long-term energy storage in off-grid energy systems.

AB Biomass deconstruction and lignin depolymerization was performed using three different deep eutectic solvents. Various temperature (110 degrees, 130 degrees, and 150 degrees C) and time (1, 5, 10, 15 min) conditions were tested in a 2450 MHz microwave reactor. Oxalic acid (130 degrees C, 15 min) and formic acid DES (150 degrees C, 15 min) gave the highest lignin yield. Microwave heating reduced the processing time significantly. NMR characterization shows that microwave heating promotes selective bond cleavage during lignin depolymerization and has a narrow molecular weight distribution compared to conventional heating techniques. Molecular dynamic simulations showed that certain lignin bonds are stretched under the electric field imparted during microwave irradiation, increasing its probability of breaking.

AB In the steam turbine, the wetness loss due to vapor condensation is one of the most crucial losses at low-pressure stage. This study focused on entropy generation and exergy destruction of condensing steam flow in turbine blade with the roughness. The governing equations including entropy transport equation combined with condensation model, transition SST model and roughness correlation were established and verified by experiments and theory. Flow field behaviors, such as wetness fraction, intermittency and turbulent viscosity distributions, controlled by the deviation angle were obtained to evaluate effects of back pressure ratio and surface roughness. The mass-averaged wetness fraction at outlet was also extracted considering the influence of uneven mass flux. Finally, each part of entropy generation derived from viscous, heat conduction, phase change and aerodynamic losses and exergy destruction ratio were analyzed. Research shows that roughness plays an important part in the intermittency and turbulent viscosity. The mass-averaged wetness fraction at outlet sharply drops with back pressure ratio but slightly decreases with the roughness. With the roughness rising or back pressure dropping, the entropy generation grows resulting in more exergy destruction. The maximum value of the total entropy generation is 84.520 J.kg(-1).K-1, corresponding exergy destruction is 25.187 kJ.kg(-1) and exergy destruction ratio is 4.43%.

AB In the current energy transition context, microgrids and multi-energy systems are becoming more and more important in practical applications. The investigation carried out in this paper is based on practical energy planning tasks implemented on different microgrids.
   The motivation for feasibility evaluation of microgrids for the purposes of ecotourism came from the realistic needs related to numerous resort energy supply related problems. These resorts have specific hourly energy demands in terms of heating, electricity, and transport. The integration of these three sectors is investigated with the aim of achieving a synergistic effect and decreasing total costs (investment and operational).
   The starting hypotheses for this work refer to the integration of such microgrids with the power market. The physical prerequisite is the construction of a connection line between a microgrid and the existing external power system.
   The HOMER software tool is used as an analytical tool for simulation, optimization and sensitivity analyses within the scope of the microgrid feasibility study of an eco-tourist resort near Trebinje. The methodology of the widely used HOMER software is extended to the variation of connection line power, having in mind the central hypothesis that it will affect its total costs.
   The obtained results show that when the connection line is constructed, total costs decrease by 43%; when the connection power line is upgraded, costs decrease by additional 5%. It is also confirmed that electricity prices on the power market have a significant influence on the feasibility of investments within the microgrid generation structure.
   This article contributes to the feasibility study methodology in the direction of including significant impacts of line rating and market conditions.

AB The industrial sector accounts for one third of the global energy use, mainly due to the energy-intensive industries. Waste heat recovery plays a major role among the advances that can lead to potential savings in these industries. The present work proposes an air compressor that generates industrial compressed air in a novel manner only by recovering heat from exhaust gases, not by consuming electric power, and employing readily available technologies transferred from other sectors. The proposed system is an externally-heated open-loop Brayton cycle operating with air in which a fraction of the compressed air from the compressor is delivered as product, while the remainder is heated up and processed in the expander. In its turn, the expander drives only the compressor and not also an electric generator as in conventional cycles. The system is simply realized combining a single- or a two-stage turbocharger from marine reciprocating engines and a recovery heat exchanger. In single-stage, it can deliver compressed air at a pressure up to 500 kPa, while in two-stage over 1000 kPa. Here, the two-stage configuration is applied to a container glass manufacturing plant and simulated accurately with the code Aspen Plus and Aspen EDR. This work demonstrates that the system could be realized with proven technology from other industrial sectors. It indicates also that 2342 m(3)/h of compressed air at 800 kPa can be produced from the exhaust gas at 12,000 m(3)/h (referred to 0 degrees C and 101.325 kPa) and 560 degrees C. The performance is affected strongly by the ambient air condition and the furnace load with variations of the compressed air rate ranging from - 92% up to + 52% in the extreme conditions. The intercooling power is typically around just 35% of the waste heat recovery and, in any case, always lower than 50%. The gross and net equivalent electric efficiencies are in the range 12-16% and 10-14%, respectively, similarly to conventional heat recovery power plants of same size. The performance can be further improved by employing the hot air from the expander as preheated combustion air or for cogeneration. Ultimately, with respect to conventional plants, the system is a simpler technology operating with a harmless fluid, requiring a lower cooling power and a smaller footprint.

AB The main transesterification used in industries involves the reaction with basic catalysts that caused unwanted soap formation, and time-consuming as post-treatment is needed. This creates the need for the utilization of a non-catalytic transesterification reaction under subcritical condition for the transformation of palm oil into biodiesel. This study evaluates the potential of using microwave technology to implement the non-catalytic transesterification for the efficient production of biodiesel. Response surface methodology (RSM) was implemented to maximise the non-catalytic biodiesel yield based on three variables: Dimethyl carbonate (DMC) to oil molar ratio, reaction temperature and reaction time. A maximum biodiesel yield of 86% was obtained with DMC to oil molar ratio of 9.5:1 at 167 degrees C after 2.5 hr of reaction. Also, its activation energy and pre-exponential factor were 44.88 kJ/mol and 7.88 x 10(3) min(-1), respectively. Biodiesel quality that satisfies the EN14214 biodiesel standard was successfully produced under subcritical condition in the absence of catalysts via this microwave processing technology. This new processing method will enhance the biodiesel production and feasibility in terms of simplicity and less production step. Besides, it needs lower power consumption compared to non-catalytic supercritical method, which brings slight enhancement in cost reduction.

AB Fuel indirect precooled engines are promising power to realize the vision of greener and faster air transportation. Efficient operation of the engines relies critically on sophisticated energy management schemes, within which the fuel plays a decisive role. Research here intends to make clear the mechanism of how the energy conversion process of this innovative cycle is driven by properties of the fuel. A unified engine model was developed for analysis, through which it indicates that besides the properties commonly known, the triple point temperature and stoichiometric heat capacity (SHC) of the fuel are also crucial to efficient engine operation. Numerical engine method and the Concorde airplane were proposed to evaluate the synthetic influence of the multiple properties on engine and vehicle performance, with four seemingly promising fuels, i.e., the methane, n-decane, methanol and hydrogen were selected for further assessment. Experiments were performed to evaluate the contribution of chemical endothermic effect (CEE) to SHC. On account of the results, the impacts of the CEE and the quantitative significance of fuel properties on engine and vehicle performance are revealed. Also, it indicates that the system fueled with hydrogen shows superior performances in engine specific impulse and specific thrust, in spite that the corresponding flight range of the vehicle is extremely poor. On the contrary, the systems using hydrocarbon fuels (i.e., methane, n-decane or methanol) exhibit better performance in vehicle flight range, but their related engine-level performances such as the specific impulse/thrust are usually lower than that using hydrogen. Considering this complementary feature, it implies that combined use of several fuels (for instance, hydrogen + kerosene) may provide more balanced and better overall performance than that of the single fuel scheme.

AB Biodiesel utilization is associated with reduced calorific value and increased nitrogen oxides emissions. Hence, various strategies are implemented to address these challenges such as water addition into diesel/biodiesel fuel blends. In line with that, this study was undertaken to explore the effect of water (3 wt.%) and aqueous carbon nanoparticles (38, 75, and 150 mu M), as a novel fuel nanoadditive, on combustion and exhaust emissions of a diesel engine at a fixed engine speed of 1000 rev/min under four different engine loads ranging from 25% to 100% of full load conditions. Overall, the engine performance characteristics were improved by incorporating the aqueous carbon nanoparticles. In particular, the incorporation of carbon nanoparticles into water-emulsified biodiesel/diesel blends generally enhanced brake power and thermal efficiency while lowering specific fuel consumption. The most appealing performance features were observed for the emulsified fuel blend containing 38 mu M carbon nanoparticles which increased brake power and brake thermal efficiency by 1.07 kW and 11.58% at full load operation, respectively, while it led to decreased brake specific fuel consumption by about 107.3 g/kWh. The addition of carbon nanoparticles to the water-emulsified fuel blends adversely affected unburned hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide emissions at full load conditions owing to an increase in carbon content of the fuel blends but it lowered nitrogen oxides emissions. The addition of water deteriorated the economic features of the fuel blend (i.e., the cost per kWh of power generated). However, carbon nanoparticles addition into the water-emulsified fuel blend partially neutralized the adverse economic effects of water due to its positive impacts on thermal efficiency. Overall, water-emulsified diesel/biodiesel containing 38 mu M carbon nanoparticles could be regarded as the most promising emulsion fuel in terms of engine performance characteristics, nitrogen oxides emissions, as well as fuel economy.

AB Limiting the increase of global temperature requires electrification of the railway transport, which is relatively a distinct mode of transport in terms of economy, business and socialization of a country. However, battery complemented railway transport systems such as fuel cell hybrid railway propulsion systems are constrained by the high cost of the battery, and suboptimal performance of the fuel cell under varying loads. Optimized selection of battery can reduce its costs associated with sizing, life and utilization. Similarly, managing the load distribution between the battery and fuel cell can reduce the load variations concern for fuel cell. In this study, model-based selective characterization of the battery and fuel cell is done to identify the optimal features and constraints. Following characterization, the load allocation to battery and fuel cell is determined with the targets of collaborative utilization of optimal features and mitigation of constraints. Subsequently, considering this load allocation and results of characterization, conditions are proposed for reliable sizing and optimized selection of battery. The significance of the proposed conditions in reliable sizing is explored. Based on these conditions, certain commercially developed batteries are evaluated for optimized selection of battery. The results signify this study as a foundation for research on the reliable sizing and optimized selection of battery in fuel cell hybrid railway propulsion systems.

AB Energy efficiency in industry is not as elevated as it should be. The aim of this paper is to present a process evaluation based on modelling as well as a waste heat recovery evaluation for a continuous heat treatment process of an Aluminium Die-Casting plant. The process is represented by production and energy dynamic (time-dependent) models combining thermal phenomena with production and economic considerations. These models allow the energy consumption, resource utilization and the production schema to be evaluated. Simulated theoretical phenomena were compared and validated with real data measurements. Once validated, the model of the heat treatment process was applied to search the best work configuration and to identify, quantify and evaluate the impact of a waste heat recovery system. Based on simulation results, their viability (energy savings or productivity increase) was quantified. The assessment shows a potential to reduce the natural gas consumption in the aging heat treatment process up to 55%, with approximately a 3-years payback period and savings of 300 MWh/year. The new working way of the process is assessed. The burners of the aging treatment process present energy reductions from 50% to 80% depending on the burner position. The new waste heat recovery system provides up to 63% of the new energy required by the aging furnace.

AB An innovative bi-evaporator electricity/cooling cogeneration system fueled by biogas is introduced. The plausibility of the introduced integrated power plant is examined from thermodynamic and economic vantage points. Later, single- and multi-objective optimization of the reckoned system are achieved by selecting appropriate parameters as decision variables and thermal and exergy efficiencies and total unit product cost (TUPC) of the system as objective functions. Four optimum modes of thermal efficiency optimum design (TEOD), exergy efficiency optimum design (EEOD), cost optimum design (COD), and multi-objective optimum design (MOOD) are selected for optimization and the attained results are compared with each other. In MOOD mode, it was found that the recommended system could generate optimum overall cooling load and net electricity of 641.7 kW and 1137 kW, respectively, achieving thermal efficiency of 62.69%, exergy efficiency of 38.75%, and TUPC of 7.75 $/GJ. It was substantiated that integrating the introduced cogeneration system with biogas-fueled gas turbine (GT) cycle could improve the thermal and exergy efficiencies up to 67.33% and 19.15% in the base mode and 77.84% and 15.94% in the optimum mode (MOOD mode), respectively. In MOOD mode, the TUPC of the integrated system is around 32.69% lower than that value in the GT cycle. The outcomes of the 2nd law evaluation portrayed that among all components, the combustion chamber attributes as the utmost destructive part of the system, followed by the vapor generator. Also, to examine how the introduced set-up reacts to any external fluctuations, a thoroughgoing sensitivity examination based upon given parameters was fulfilled.

AB In this study, a novel oxy-fuel cascade thermo-photovoltaic (TPV) system concept was proposed and researched. Oxy-fuel combustion was used to reduce NOx emissions and the proposed cascade design and an increase in oxygen ratio were used to enhance the TPV system output. A physical model was established to conduct thermodynamic calculations to determine the influence of the cascade design and oxygen ratio on the system performance under oxy-fuel conditions. Moreover, the optimal area distribution of the cascade TPV and its influencing factors were determined and a preliminary assessment of the emission reduction potential was conducted. The results showed that the cascade design improved the system efficiency and a comprehensive comparison indicated the superiority of the two-stage TPV. An increase in the oxygen ratio under oxy-fuel conditions increased the system efficiency and resulted in considerable NOx emission reduction. Moreover, the multi-stage TPV system has an optimal area distribution, and an increase in the oxygen ratio increased the optimal area of the first stage. This study provides a reference for the design of high-efficiency TPV energy conversion systems.

AB Graphene family nanomaterials including single-layer graphene, multi-layer graphene, graphene quantum dots, graphene nanoplatelets, graphene oxide, and so forth demonstrate many excellent characteristics along with great thermal conductivity. Consequently, they are appropriate candidates for utilization in nanofluids and have recently received major attention in this area. Although many studies have been performed on graphene-based nanofluids, there is no thorough review article in which effective mechanisms on revealing enhancements and failures of graphene nanofluids are surveyed. Concerning various progress and problems existing in the field of graphene nanofluids, performing a complete review in this context is highly required, and there are still a lot of challenges that should be evaluated. In this review paper, the capabilities of graphene-based nanofluids are examined, and new developments on preparation techniques, stability improvement, and types of surfactants utilized are reviewed. Thermophysical properties, convective heat transfer, boiling, hydrodynamic attributes, and second law characteristics of graphene-family nanofluids are also investigated. Moreover, approaches such as molecular dynamics and artificial intelligence used in this field are reported and discussed. In addition, applications including use of graphene-based nanofluids in car radiators, heat exchangers, solar thermal, heat pipes, electronics cooling, and energy storage are presented. This in-depth review also identifies available challenges and recommends several directions for future research in this field. Finally, it is concluded that graphene family materials can improve the characteristics of base fluids considerably.

AB Acid washed Shengli lignite (AWSL) supported Ni, Co and Ni-Co catalysts were prepared, characterized and evaluated in catalytic reforming (CR) of corncob pyrolysis volatiles at a relatively low catalytic temperature of 450 degrees C. Moreover, the production and selectivity of H-2 were also investigated. Amongst the catalysts studied, bimetallic Ni-10%Co/AWSL exhibited the most remarkable activity, yielding 36.3 mmol H-2/g corncob and 710 mu mol min(-1) g(-1) formation rate of syngas (H-2 + CO + 4CH(4)) with trace of tar. It also tuned the gas composition and showed the greatest selectivity of H-2 due to the promotion of the water gas shift reaction (with Hy accounting for the maximum 50.3% and 63% under Ar and steam atmosphere, respectively). Regardless of the loss of specific surface area, the superior performance of Ni-Co based catalysts under mild circumstance was attributed to the better reducibility and electronic properties along with a high dispersion of active metal. Additionally, the synergy of Ni and Co contributed to the combined and enlarged activity for CR of corncob volatiles and great selectivity for H-2-rich syngas under moderate condition.

AB Due to the existence of wake effect that causes the reduction of intake wind speed among wind turbines in the downwind direction, the wind farm efficiency is substantially discounted. An integral question to ask is how to find the optimal wind turbine layout given a wind farm. Inspired by the self-adjustment capability among individuals in the natural evolution process, a new algorithm called support vector regression guided genetic algorithm is proposed to solve the wind warm layout optimization problem which integrates the capability in each individual to adjust itself for a better "fitness" with guiding information sampled from a response surface approximated by support vector regression. It is also interesting to use the new proposed algorithm to evaluate the impact of the constraints imposed by landowners' willingness whether to rent their land to the wind farm company. Extensive numerical experiments under different settings of wind distribution and wind farms with unusable cells are conducted to validate the proposed algorithm, shedding insights on the impact of landowners' participation on the overall efficiency. The experiment showcases that the proposed algorithm outperforms two baseline algorithms under different conditions with improved efficiency. The proposed framework with consideration of landowners' participation decision provide insights for wind farm planner on the different values of farm lands from the landowners.

AB The Scale-Adaptive Simulation (SAS) approach has emerged as an improved unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) formulation to bridge the gap between the less accurate commonly used URANS and the computationally expensive hybrid RANS/LES for highly separated unsteady flows, e.g. dynamic stall. However, while the SAS has been successfully used at several occasions, it has not yet been tested for the complex case of dynamic stall. Therefore, the present study analyzes the SAS predictions of dynamic stall on a vertical axis wind turbine at a chord Reynolds number of 5 x 10(4) and a reduced frequency of 0.125. The analysis is based on comparison of the SAS predictions of the blade aerodynamics and the turbine power performance against the corresponding URANS and hybrid RANS/LES predictions. The results show that the SAS predictions are closer to hybrid RANS/LES than URANS with respect to: (i) the instant of the bursting of the laminar separation bubble (LSB), the leading-edge suction collapse, the formation of the dynamic stall vortex (DSV) and the trailing-edge vortex (TEV) and the shedding of the TEV; (ii) the size and strength of the TEV; (iii) the DSV-TEV interaction; (iv) the drag prediction during the downstroke. On the other hand, both URANS and SAS fail to corroborate with hybrid RANS/LES with respect to: (i) the instant of the formation of the LSB and the shedding of the DSV (the stall angle); (ii) the drag jump at the stall angle; (iii) the lift values during the downstroke; and (iv) the chordwise extent of the LSB.

AB The objective of this study is to develop a novel phase change nanocomposite for efficient electromagnetic and solar energy conversion and storage. The multifunctional nanocomposites are formulated by using PEG/SiO2 as form-stable phase change material and well-dispersed Fe3O4-functionalised graphene nanosheets (Fe3O4-GNS) as energy converter. The magnetothermal effect of Fe3O4 nanoparticles and light harvesting properties of graphene in Fe3O4-GNS, enabled the efficient magnetic- or light-to-heat conversions under an alternating magnetic field or solar illumination. The heat generated during the energy conversion process is stored in the form-stable phase change material due to the melting phase transition of PEG. Moreover, the phase change material nanocomposites exhibit high energy storage capacity (exceeding up to 100 J/g), excellent thermal stability and reversibility. This novel energy conversion and storage system will provide new insights into the field of energy management for electromagnetic or solar driven devices.

AB In present work, cow dung was chosen as the raw material to undergo incomplete carbonization process which was held at 500 degrees C for 2 h. The incomplete carbonized carbon was then sulfonated with H2SO4 at different sulfonation time (2 h, 5 h and 10 h) in studying the relationship between sulfonation time and the activity of the catalyst. From the TPD-NH3 analysis, sulfonated carbon catalyst derived cow dung at 10 h (SCD-((1)(0)) catalyst) was chosen due to the higher acid density which is 16,653.49 mu mol/g. Meanwhile, the experimental results showed that SCD-((1)(0)) catalyst exhibited good catalytic activity with high FFA conversion of 96.5% at optimum parameter of 18:1 methanol to PFAD molar ratio, 4 wt% of catalyst loading and 90 degrees C reaction temperature within 1 h reaction time. The catalyst was successfully reused for 7 cycles and it was found that the catalytic activity maintained with > 90% of FFA conversion for the first three run. SCD-((1)(0)) catalyst can be easily recovered and regenerated by simple washing method. Cow dung derived carbon catalyst concluded to be environmentally friendly and efficient for biodiesel production.

AB Recovering fuels or chemicals from plastic waste via pyrolysis is an innovative and promising route for both energy saving and refuse elimination. In this study, catalytic microwave-assisted pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) was performed to simultaneously improve yield and quality of gasoline-range products. NiO and HY zeolite were respectively used as in-situ and ex-situ catalysts in a two-stage pyrolysis-catalysis system. The results showed that the optimum pyrolysis and catalysis temperatures were 500 degrees C and 450 degrees C, respectively, with 56.53 wt% oil product and 93.80% gasoline-range fraction achieved. The content of highoctane-number compounds, primarily aromatics and isomerized aliphatics, increased from 23.5% to 80.4% as HY to LDPE ratio rose from 0 to 1:5. The optimized balance between oil yield and oil quality was obtained at the HY to LDPE ratio of 1:10. The presence of NiO during co-catalysis slightly decreased the oil yield by 5.3-8.5 wt%. Meanwhile, the production of aromatics was promoted obviously while the yield of normal aliphatics was inhibited, which were both favorable to improve the octane number of the oil product. The improved performance of co-catalysis could be related to the suitable hydrogen abstraction ability of NiO, which produced enormous alkenes. Subsequently, cycloalkenes and aromatics were synthesized through Diels-Alder reactions over the catalysis of HY. This co-catalysis approach in the microwave reactor provides a potentially profitable way to convert plastic waste into high-quality and high-yield gasoline fuels.

AB This study focused on a novel approach for biodiesel production and metallic iron synthesis using biochar obtained from the biomass residue of green microalgae Botryococcus sp. Hematite (Fe2O3) is one of the most important iron ore used in steelmaking industries. Thus, we proposed this work for the development of algal biorefinery concept at commercial scale. This work contains two phases; in the first phase, the alga was successfully cultivated on the domestic wastewater at large scale using a low-cost photobioreactor, which provided significant biomass and lipid yield. To reduce the cost involved in biomass harvesting, an auto-flocculation technique was implemented and harvested 94.8% of biomass without adding any flocculants. The biodiesel extraction was performed in an ultrasonic bath with a frequency of 25 kHz using a tungstated zirconia as a heterogeneous acid catalyst, which produced 94.1 wt% of biodiesel yield. The kinetic studies were investigated at various reaction temperature and confirmed that the reaction followed a pseudo-first-order kinetic model. The activation energy and pre-exponential factor for the transesterification reaction were found to be 45.3861 kJ mol(-1) and 2.6956 min(-1), respectively. In the second phase, the lipid extracted residue was converted to biochar through pyrolysis process, and the yield obtained was 41 wt%. The obtained biochar was utilized for metallic iron synthesis, and this reaction was carried out in a thermogravimetric analyzer equipped with Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. The results showed that the reduction behaviors was occurred in a stepwise manner rendering to the temperature and the metallic iron synthesis was found at 990 degrees C.

AB Battery energy storage systems can play a substantial role in maintaining low-cost operation in microgrids, and therefore finding their optimal size is a key element of microgrids' planning and design. This paper explores the optimal sizing options for batteries in microgrids that include wind turbines, solar photovoltaics, synchronous machines and a grid connection supply under various types of retail tariff schemes. The optimal size of batteries is hypothesized to be significantly related to the intelligent control rules applied to dispatch the microgrid sources. This problem can be formulated as a mixed linear integer problem and can be solved using linear/nonlinear solvers depending on the complexity of the generation control plan. The main objective of this work is to apply online intelligent adaptation mechanism to tune the economic generation control (dispatch) rules of the microgrid. This tuning objectives are maintaining secure operation, maximizing profitable utilization of batteries and managing their charging life-cycles. While sizing options exploration has been formulated as a linear programming based optimization problem, Fuzzy-Logic is proposed to control the charging/discharging time and quantity for batteries. For the sake of performance comparison, various optimization techniques, i.e., Particle Swarm Optimization, Genetic Algorithm and Flower Pollination Algorithm are applied to perform the economic dispatch calculation. As a case study, a commercial type load connected to the 22 kV distribution network in south Western Australia was used in the testing and validation if the results of the proposed sizing method. The operation condition data was obtained from Western Power the distribution and transmission company in south Western Australia, the Australian Bureau Of Meteorology (BOM) and the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO). The results showed that employing intelligent batteries in operation can reduce the annual generation cost of microgrids. However, the decision on selecting the size of batteries depends heavily on the amount of upfront investment cost. The simulation results showed that the intelligence added to batteries' control could achieve 6.5%, 7.6% and 11.5% of the annual generation cost in the Islanded, Grid-connected with no-export and Grid-connected with export operating modes respectively. Also, intelligent batteries operation control was proven to minimize their payback time to 2.8, 2.7 and 2.7 years in the Islanded, Grid-connected with no-export and Grid-connected with export operating modes respectively.

AB The development of novel technologies that can effectively solve the problems of energy shortage and environmental pollution is urgently required. To this end, a multistage integrated system coupled with a two-stroke marine diesel engine, waste heat recovery, absorption refrigeration, seawater desalination, and seawater desulfurization is designed and modeled in this study, which can reasonably utilise various forms of engine waste heat to meet the daily supply and stricter emission requirements of ships, as well as improve thermal efficiency. The accuracy of the simulation results is verified by comparing them with existing experimental data. The influence of parameters, such as the increment ratio of cycle fuel injection, expansion ratio, and evaporation pressure, on the performance of the integrated system are discussed on the basis of demonstrating the excellent transient response characteristics of diesel engines. In addition, the thermal efficiency, exergy efficiency, cooling capacity, and freshwater output are calculated under optimum operating conditions. Finally, the performance of desulfurization and the effect of the integrated system on Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) are studied. The results indicate that the desulfurization rate of the integrated system is more than 94% and the EEDI meets the 2020 emission requirements. Therefore, the design is available and effective, and provides a feasible idea for researchers studying the problem of energy consumption and emissions associated with ships.

   energy sources; Carbon dioxide emissions; Data analysis
AB The power system has faced unprecedented challenges in the last decade caused by many factors: the introduction of the open electricity market, the diffusion of distributed generation, the growth of the electricity production from the no-programmable renewable energy sources, etc. In this framework the power generation system turned extremely varied and complex. In addition, European Union highlighted the need to increase the energy efficiency to achieve the goal of 30% savings in primary energy consumption by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. Since the goal is defined on primary energy level, the electric efficiency indicators are central issues in the assessment of energy saving measures that affect electricity demand and involve different processes. However, all European Directives set electric efficiency indicators and carbon dioxide emission factors to fixed values neglecting their intrinsic time-variability due to the primary energy source mix used in the electricity generation hour by hour. The use of a fixed value for these parameters could lead to inaccurate or wrong results in various processes. Indeed, they have an impact on the choice of electricity versus fossil-fuel based technologies. In particular, they affect both the possibility for a product to retain access to European market, and its specific rating in an energy labelling class. Moreover, in the case of the modelling of any energy system that interacts with the power grid the electric efficiency indicators are the crucial factors to assess the potential primary energy savings of the technologies. On another level, the use of an incorrect value of energy and environmental indicators in the evaluation of the primary energy savings of those energy efficiency measures supported by economic mechanisms (as white certificates, policy mechanisms supporting renewables, tax deductions), could lead to an underestimation or an overestimation of the economic support. In this context, the aim of this paper is to perform an hourly analysis of the Italian electricity production mix evaluating the contribution of each primary energy source. The novelty of this approach is related to the evaluation of the electricity produced by each fossil and renewable source with an hourly time resolution over the years 2016 and 2017. Four power plant efficiency indicators and three carbon dioxide emission factors have been also defined and determined on hourly basis for both considered years. The results of the analysis have showed the strongly variability of the considered parameters across the years, the seasons and hour by hour depending upon the hourly power generation mix.

AB Marine macroalgae (seaweed) is a promising feedstock for producing biohydrogen and biomethane via dark fermentation and anaerobic digestion, respectively. However, one of the limiting steps in the biological process is the conversion of polymeric carbohydrates into monomeric sugars. Here hydrothermal pretreatments were assessed for hydrolysis and subsequent production of biohydrogen and biomethane from the brown seaweed Saccharina latissima. The solubilization of S. latissima improved with increasing temperatures from 100 to 180 degrees C, resulting in a maximum yield of 0.70 g soluble chemical oxygen demand/gram volatile solid (sCOD/g VS); equivalent to an increase of 207.5% compared with untreated seaweed. However, the yield of the derived monomeric sugar mannitol peaked at 140 degrees C and decreased with increasing temperatures, likely due to production of fermentative inhibitors. Microstructural characterization revealed that the algal structure was significantly damaged, and the major chemical groups of carbohydrates and proteins were weakened after pretreatment. Regardless of hydrothermal temperatures, biohydrogen yield only slightly increased in dark fermentation, while biomethane yield significantly increased from 281.4 (untreated S. latissima) to 345.1 mL/g VS (treated at 140 degrees C), leading to the sCOD removal efficiency of 86.1%. The maximum energy conversion efficiency of 72.8% was achieved after two-stage biohydrogen and biomethane co-production. In comparison, considering the energy input for pretreatment/fermentation/digestion, the highest process energy efficiency dropped to 37.8%. Further calculations suggest that a significant improvement of efficiency up to 56.9% can be achieved if the heat from pretreatment can be recovered.

AB As a renewable and clean energy, wind energy plays an important role in easing the increasingly serious energy crisis. However, due to the strong volatility and randomness of wind speed, large-scale integration of wind energy is limited. Therefore, obtaining reliable high-quality wind speed prediction is of great importance for the planning and application of wind energy. The purpose of this study is to develop a hybrid model for short-term wind speed forecasting and quantifying its uncertainty. In this study, Minimal Gated Memory Network is proposed to reduce the training time without significantly decreasing the prediction accuracy. Furthermore, a new hybrid method combining Quantile Regression and Minimal Gated Memory Network is proposed to predict conditional quantile of wind speed. Afterwards, Kernel Density Estimation method is used to estimate wind speed probabilistic density function according to these conditional quantiles of wind speed. In order to make the model show better performance, Maximal Information Coefficient is used to select the feature variables while Genetic Algorithm is used to obtain optimal feature combinations. Finally, the performance of the proposed model is verified by seven state-of-the-art models through four cases in Inner Mongolia, China from five aspects: point prediction accuracy, interval prediction suitability, probability prediction comprehensive performance, forecast reliability and training time. The experimental results show that the proposed model is able to obtain point prediction results with high accuracy, suitable prediction interval and probability distribution function with strong reliability in a relatively short time on the prediction problems of wind speed.

AB Pyrolysis of sewage sludge in the presence of humic acid (HA), CaO and kaolin was investigated in order to examine the effects of organic and inorganic constituents on the product properties. The presence of HA in the sludge increased the yields of H-2 and CO compared to that from the raw sludge pyrolysis. Water evolved during decomposition of kaolin promoted the water-gas shift reaction resulting in less CO in the gas phase. The presence of CaO in the sludge had a major influence on CO2 sequestration reducing the volume of non-condensable gas by 18% compared to that from the raw sludge pyrolysis. In contrast, CO volume increased due to the induced Boudouard reaction. No significant impact on the distribution of the chemical compounds in the organic or aqueous phase was observed with the addition of HA to the sludge. Among the inorganic additives, CaO catalysed deoxygenation and ring opening reactions leading to an increment of aliphatic compounds in the organic phase of tar while kaolin did not show any significant impact. HA in sludge increased the carbon content in the derived char to 35.2% compared to that in the char derived from the raw sludge (31.0%). In contrast, kaolin and CaO resulted in higher char yields with lower carbon contents due to high ash content in the raw samples. Regarding heavy metals fate, the addition of HA and CaO to the sludge effectively immobilised heavy metals in the derived char while kaolin appeared to be less effective.

AB The biomass gasification coupled with a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) system is one of the most efficient and environmentally friendly technologies for combined heat and power generations. For the development and improvement of the integrated process systems, the optimization problem has more than one conflicting objective functions to be optimized (i.e., thermodynamic performance, environmental impacts, annual profit, capital and operating costs) simultaneously. Multi-objective optimization (MOO) methods are used to find a set of optimal (or non-dominated) solutions. In this work, MOO of a sorption enhanced steam biomass gasification (SEG) integrated with an SOFC and gas turbine (GT) system, for combined heat and power production from Eucalyptus wood chips as biomass feedstock, is investigated. Firstly, the model of this integrated plant is developed in Aspen Plus that can be divided into five parts: (1) SEG, (2) hot gas cleaning and steam reforming, (3) SOFC, (4) catalytic burning, GT and CO2 compression, and (5) Portland cement production. As the annual profit demonstrates the economic viability of the plant and annualized capital cost (ACC) indicates availability of investments, the MOO of the integrated plant is performed to obtain Pareto-optimal solutions based on the minimization of ACC and maximization of annual profit with five important decision variables. After that, ten selection methods are used to recommend practical solutions for implementing in the integrated plant. In order to explore the effect of decision variables uncertainty on obtained Pareto-optimal solutions, random variations in decision variables are used to quantify deviations in objective functions. The Pareto-optimal solutions are ranked based on the normalized variations for decision variables uncertainty. At the end of this study, robust MOO of the integrated plant is performed, with respect to uncertainties in the market and operating parameters.

AB Water management is the key to achieving higher performance and better stability of fuel cells with dead-ended anodes. A fuel supply mode called two-way hydrogen supply mode is applied to a 10-cell open-cathode proton exchange membrane fuel cell stack in this study to improve the water management of the stack. In the new mode, hydrogen can be intermittently supplied from the anode outlet to the stack under the mutual cooperation of two solenoid valves, in addition to the conventional anode inlet. A series of experiments are performed and the relevant parameters such as temperature, voltage and pressure are analyzed to investigate the effects of the applied mode on the operating characteristics of the stack. The results show that the new mode can generate periodic disturbances in the anode compartment, which is beneficial to the uniform distribution of species and the mass transfer enhancement of hydrogen. As a result, the voltage decay is significantly decelerated and the output performance is more stable. Meanwhile, it turns out that this mode is preferable for applications at high currents. Finally, an improvement is made to address the problems of the mode. The results show that the improved mode can further reduce the voltage decay rate and increase net power by 3%.

AB The paper studies the performance of a novel generator, consisting of a ball tightly sandwiched between two dielectric elastomeric membranes for energy harvesting. The membranes are built into a housing subjected to external ambient random vibrations, so that the relative motion between the ball and the membranes deforms the latter allowing energy conversion. A dynamic model of the nonlinear mechanical and electrical behaviour of the device is presented, and a novel approach for estimating the mean output energy of the device is developed. An explicit analytical formula for the mean output power, derived and presented for the first time, allows comparing the generator performance depending on the level of nonlinearity and the membranes deformation rate. A comparison of the generator performance for the linear and nonlinear device properties is demonstrated. The numerical results of the Monte-Carlo simulations are presented and agreed well with the derived analytical estimation.

AB Today, particular attention is being globally paid towards clean and sustainable energy system. The rapid development in renewable energy technologies, growth of energy markets, and adopted financial strategies and policies have the key role in achieving this target. This paper provides a comprehensive feasibility analysis of a gird-isolated hybrid renewable energy system for electrification of agriculture and irrigation area in Dongola, Sudan. A systematic and integrative framework combined with techno-economic optimization analysis for adequate planning and design of hybrid renewable energy system is proposed. Different hybridization cases of a solar photovoltaic, wind turbine, diesel generator, battery storage, and converter technologies, together with a diesel generator-based energy system as base case are modeled, evaluated and compared considering the stochastic behavior of renewable energy resources with a main target to find the most feasible and reliable solution with least system cost and realistic environmental impacts. This followed by a sensitivity analysis to reveal the effects of uncertainty in system parameters on the designed system and its economic performance. The obtained results indicate that solar-wind-diesel-battery-converter hybrid system is of optimal performance and superiority over the studied cases to serve the load demand of the investigated area. The system not only gets the minimum values of the total net present cost (24.16 M$) and levelized cost of energy (0.387 $/kWh), but also effectively achieves a positive return on investment of 39.94% and around 95% reduction in both carbon emissions and fuel consumption compared to the base case. Meanwhile, the result of sensitivity analysis demonstrates the high dependability of system cost on the volatility of solar radiation and wind speed as well as the changes in the rate of interest with the prospect of ignoring the effect of variation of diesel fuel price in the future investment decision. Finally, the output of this study is projected to raising the potentiality awareness of renewable energy in Sudan and providing a valuable reference about the optimal planning and utilization of hybrid renewable energy system in energy sector.

AB The extensive application of biochar (BC) attracts concerns regarding its environmental effect. Waste-water treatment systems are potential BC recipients; however, the impacts of BC on these systems are still unclear. In this study, effects of BC on the phenol treatment performance and shift in microbial communities in sequencing batch reactor (SBR) were investigated. The phenol degradation rates were enhanced in all BC-treated SBRs during the whole operation due to promotion of key enzymes involved in phenol degradation. The decrease in abundance of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) in SBRs indicated that BC protected microorganisms by ameliorating phenol toxicity, leading to a decrease in the secretion of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). The functional groups, protein (C=O, -CO-NH), polysaccharide (C-OH, C-O-C, C-O), and nucleic acids (O-P-O) associated bonds of EPS decreased or disappeared in BC-treated SBRs. Miseq sequencing revealed significant decrease in bacterial diversity and remarkable changes in the bacterial community structure in BC-treated SBRs. Abundances of Comamonas and Cupriavidus increased significantly upon BC exposure, which contributed to phenol degradation. Treatment with relatively high BC dosage exhibited considerable inhibition on Thauera. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) indicated that the shift in abundances of these genera was closely associated with BC dosage. This study suggested that BC exerted protective effects on sludge microbes of phenol wastewater treatment systems, while it affected the bacterial community structure and diversity at test concentrations. Thus, this study elucidates the comprehensive effects of BC on wastewater treatment process. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Photochemical production of hydroxyl radical (center dot OH) from algal organic matter (AOM) collected from Lake Torrens in South Australia was examined using a sunlight simulator. The two AOM isolates featured lower molecular weight, lower chromophoric content, and lower SUVA(254) (0.7 and 0.9, L mgC(-1) m(-1)) than the reference Suwannee River hydrophobic acid (SR-HPO), they had considerably higher apparent quantum yields (phi(OH)(NOM), 3.03 x 10(-5) and 2.18 x 10(-5)) than SR-HPO (0.84 x 10(-5)). Fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (FEEM) showed that the major components in the AOM were aromatic protein-like and soluble microbial substances. Unique formulas of the two AOM isolates as compared to SR-HPO were revealed using FTICR-MS and classified into four areas, namely protein-like molecules with low O/C (H/ C> 1.5, O/C: 0.2-0.4), lignin-derived moieties with low O/C (H/C:1.0-1.5, O/C: 0.1-0.3), protein-like molecules with high O/C (H/C> 1.5, O/C: 0.5-0.7), and carbohydrate derivatives (H/C> 1.5, O/C> 0.7). These unique AOM moieties characterised utilizing FEEM and FTICR-MS were tentatively postulated to contribute to the high phi(OH)(NOM). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study performed to both evaluate natural AOM as an efficient photosensitiser of center dot OH and propose AOM moieties responsible for the high phi(OH)(NOM).

AB The objective of this research is to examine the influence of surfactant and solution composition on PFAS adsorption at fluid-fluid interfaces. Surface tensions were measured for select PFAS, as well as a representative hydrocarbon surfactant. These data are supplemented with data sets collected from the literature. The influence of surfactant headgroup charge, specifically for zwitterionic PFAS, was investigated. The impacts of surfactant counterion for ionic PFAS and the influence of headgroup size for nonionic PFAS were also investigated. In addition, the influence of solution ion composition, ionic strength, and pH was examined. The impact of co-solutes, specifically ethanol, humic acid, and trichloroethene, was also examined, as well as the behavior of PFAS mixtures and fluorocarbon-hydrocarbon surfactant mixtures. The data were interpreted within the framework of a QSPR model recently developed to predict fluid-fluid interfacial adsorption coefficients (K-i) of PFAS. The results demonstrate that all of the factors investigated have some degree of impact on K-i values. Thus, the composition of soil-pore water and groundwater is likely to affect the magnitude of PFAS adsorption at air-water and organic liquid-water interfaces. However, the influence on K-i of most of the factors investigated is small for lower PFAS concentrations (less than similar to 1-10 mg/L). Hence, their impacts on fluid-fluid interfacial adsorption are likely to be relatively minor at the low PFAS concentrations representative of many environmental systems, especially compared to the impact of other factors such as fluid saturations, porous-medium properties, and PFAS molecular structure. The results of this study indicate that the revised QSPR model provides reasonable first-order predictions of K-i for a wide range of PFAS in environmental systems. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study examined the formation of fouling films deposited on the surface of a polyethersulfone (PES) membrane during the filtration of alginate solutions with various ionic strengths. Membrane fouling was characterized by changes of the transmembrane pressure (TMP) and ex situ measured attenuated total reflectance (ATR) Fourier-transform IR (FTIR) spectra at varying stages of filtration runs. The ATR spectra that comprise the vibration bands characteristic of the PES substrate and the deposited film were processed taking into the gradual weakening of the PES substrate-specific bands, whose intensity was shown to depend on the wavenumber of IR radiation and the thickness of the deposited layer. Strongly linear correlations between ratios of first derivatives intensity and wavenumbers of the PES reference lines were established. Calculations of the PES bands' attenuation coefficients allowed determining the apparent thickness and ATR FTIR vibrations of the fouling films per se. Strong correlations between TMP development and ATR-determined apparent thickness of the fouling layers were observed. The intensity of ATR absorbance at 3200 cm(-1) was linearly correlated with TMP development for small TMP values before the point of rapidly developing failure of the hydraulic permeability of the system was reached.

AB Nitrite-dependent anaerobic methane oxidation (N-DAMO) is a newly discovered bioprocess which uses methane as electron donor to reduce nitrite into dinitrogen. It is a promising clean bioprocess for denitrification in wastewater treatment. However, the low reaction rate and slow growth rate of N-DAMO bacteria within NC10 phylum limit the application of the process. In this study, we chose vitamin, heme, nucleobase and betaine to investigate their short- and long-term effects on N-DAMO bacteria. The concentrations of the growth factors of medium were improved according to the short-term experiments. The results were subsequently verified via long-term inoculations and were applied in a magnetically stirred gas lift reactor (MSGLR). The results indicated that nucleobase and betaine (5.0 and 200 mu g L-1, respectively) significantly stimulated the N-DAMO activity, whereas vitamin and heme had no significant effects in the tested concentration ranges. During the long-term incubation, N-DAMO bacteria continuously increased and finally achieved a relative abundance of 14.4% on day 300. Notably, larger aggregates of N-DAMO bacteria were observed at the end of the long-term incubation. And the nitrogen removal rate of the MSGLR increased to 70 mg N L-1 day(-1), with the total nitrogen removal efficiency over 99.0%. However, the addition of betaine introduced methyl into the reactors and this made methylotrophs account a considerable part of the bacterial community, which limited the enrichment degree of N-DAMO bacteria. This work will contribute to the engineering application and enrichment of N-DAMO bacteria. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Arctic rivers export a large amount of organic carbon (OC) and mercury (Hg) to Arctic oceans. Because there are only a few direct calculations of OC and Hg exports from these large rivers, very little is known about their response to changes in the active layer in northern permafrost-dominated areas. In this study, multiyear data sets from the Arctic Great Rivers Observatory (ArcticGRO) are used to estimate the export of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), particulate organic carbon (POC), total mercury (THg) and methylmercury (MeHg) from the six largest rivers (Yenisey, Lena, Ob, Mackenzie, Yukon and Kolyma) draining to the Arctic Ocean. From 2003 to 2017, annual DOC and POC export to the Arctic Ocean was approximately 21612 Gg and 2728 Gg, and the exports of Hg and MeHg to the Arctic Ocean were approximately 20090 kg and 110 kg (0.002% of the total Hg stored in the northern hemisphere active layer). There were great variations in seasonal OC and Hg concentrations and chemical characteristics, with higher fluxes in spring and lower fluxes in winter (baseline). DOC and Hg concentrations are significantly positively correlated to discharge, as discharge continues to increase in response to a deepening active layer thickness during recent past decades. This study shows that previous results likely underestimated DOC exports from rivers in the circum-Arctic regions, and both OC and Hg exports will increase under predicted climate warming scenarios.

AB Bioretention systems have been found to be potential candidates for the removal of various pollutants/ nutrients from rainfall or stormwater runoff. Despite bioretention has been widely developed for the removal of nutrients from stormwater, effective removal of both phosphorus and nitrogen is still a challenge. Hence, in this study, bioretention systems modified by alkaline solid waste media have been reported for the effective removal of nutrients. Six different types of solid wastes were first assessed using leaching and adsorption tests, and then the bottom ash from a refuse incineration plant was selected as a modifier. The bottom ash was mixed with soil to form a special media as the filter layer in the bioretention systems. The nutrient removal efficiencies of the modified bioretention systems were evaluated and also compared with those of the unmodified control. For this purpose, the design of the modified filter media with a saturated zone was combined to enhance the simultaneous removal of nitrogen and phosphorus. The effect of different rainfall intensities and nutrient concentrations in stormwater runoff on the removal efficiency of nutrients was evaluated. The results indicated that the modified bioretention with bottom ash modified soil media and saturated zone could exhibit the excellent removal efficiency of nitrogen and phosphorus from stormwater runoff. The extent of removal of total nitrogen, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, and total phosphorus was found to be 58-70%, 66-82% and 82 -97%, respectively. The performed correlation analysis showed that the bioretention cell using the special media could simultaneously enhance the removal of phosphorus and nitrogen. As a part of this study, the adsorption isotherms of phosphorus removal by the modified bioretention systems have also been determined. Finally, the implications and opportunities for deploying modified bioretention systems for optimizing water-energy nexus and stormwater management were illustrated. In overall, this study demonstrated that the modified bioretention systems could substantially enhance the removal efficiencies of nutrients from stormwater runoff. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In dealing with wastewater, chemical energy has traditionally been perceived as the only source of recoverable energy in moving towards the carbon-neutral operation of wastewater treatment plants. Based on an estimation of practically recoverable energy embedded in municipal wastewater, however, the potential for thermal energy (90% recovery from wastewater) is much higher than for chemical energy (COD, 10% recovery). The carrier of chemical energy (COD) has a high exergy value which should, from a sustainability point of view, be utilized to the greatest extent possible. Rather than being converted into methane (and subsequently into carbon dioxide), carbon (COD) contained in wastewater should be converted into highly valuable organic products. Thermal energy could be utilized for district heating/cooling, agricultural greenhouses, and even for drying dewatered sludge. In this way, thermal energy can indirectly offset the energy demand for wastewater treatment. The limitations in utilizing thermal energy are not generally based on technical difficulties; in fact, they can be mainly attributed to supply distances and governmental policies. It would, therefore, be greatly beneficial if municipal authorities would work together to jointly plan utilization of this thermal energy. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Phosphonate is an important phosphorous species in the effluent of wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), contributing to eutrophication and interfering with phosphate removal in WWTP. It is particularly difficult to determine phosphonates in samples of complex solution chemistry, resulting in very limited information on their presence in environmental matrices. Herein, we proposed a sensitive method based on liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to determine six quantitatively most important phosphonates even at the ng/L level, i.e., 2-phosphonobutane-1,2,4-tricarboxylic acid, 1-hydroxyethane 1,1-diphosphonic acid, nitrilotris(methylene phosphonic acid), ethylenediamine tetra(methylene phosphonic acid), hexamethylenediamine tetra(methylene phosphonic acid) and diethylenetriamine penta(methylene phosphonic acid). Trimethylsilyldiazomethane (TMSCHN2) derivatization of the target phosphonates is pre-requisite since it could greatly increase the sensitivity up to 2-3 orders of magnitude over direct analysis of the virgin ones. The sample pretreatment methods (including ion exchange and solid phase extraction(SPE)), the derivatization procedures, and the LC-MS/MS conditions were systematically optimized. The limits of quantitation for the six phosphonates in the background of tap water ranged from 1.4 mu g/L to 57 mu g/L for direct analysis, and from 5.0 ng/L to 200 ng/L for SPE enabled pre-concentration analysis, respectively. The reliability of the proposed method was successfully validated by analysis of authentic water samples collected from one river and three WWTPs (0.088-7200 mu g/L phosphonates) with satisfactory recoveries (72-126%). To the best of knowledge, this is the first report on quantification of phosphonates in environmental samples in China. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To discover an applicable technology for urea abatement from swimming pool water (SPW), this study compared the performances of seven ultraviolet (UV)-based technologies on urea removal, including UV alone, UV coupled with hydrogen peroxide (UV/H2O2), sulfite (UV/Na2SO3), potassium persulfate (UV/K2S2O8), a combination of UV and vacuum UV (UV/VUV), and UV/VUV in tandem with either H2O2 (VUV/H2O2) or potassium persulfate (VUV/K2S2O8). Among them, UV and UV/Na2SO3 showed little removal ability, and UV/H2O2 removed only 12.8% of urea within 3-h experiments, while UV/VUV degraded 71.7% of urea without introducing substantial total dissolved solids (TDS). Therefore, UV/VUV was considered as a promising technology for further exploration. In comparison, although UV/K2S2O8 exhibited higher urea removal than UV/VUV, it caused dramatic increases of TDS, which made the regulatory threshold for the TDS increment difficult to maintain. Within UV/VUV studies, some common components in SPW (e.g., cyanuric acid, humic acid, nitrate, and bicarbonate) inhibited the removal process, whereas chloride and sulfate facilitated it, while free chlorine at doses <= 3 mg-Cl-2/L and pH levels from 6.8 to 8.0 imposed little impact on urea degradation. Overall, UV/VUV degraded 40.0% and 22.2% of urea from tap water and SPW, respectively; both were lower than the efficiency observed in ultrapure water. As for reaction byproducts, urea phototransformation via UV/VUV yielded nitrate and ammonia as the key products with the mass balance of nitrogen element being met. However, the contents of organic carbon decreased at a rate slightly lower than urea degradation, suggesting that urea was mostly mineralized and slightly converted to unknown organic compounds. The results hence demonstrate that UV/VUV is an effective alternative for urea removal from SPW. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Identifying vertical and horizontal assemblage drivers of bacterial community is important for improving the efficacies of ecological evaluation and remediation for a huge contaminated river (e.g. black-odor urban river). However, little is known about the effect of stochastic vs. deterministic processes on the reliability of the identification processes. Here, a comprehensive analysis was performed to reveal vertical and horizontal assemblage drivers of bacterial community in a heavily polluted urban river (total area of 4.23 km(2) and total length of 9.3 km), considering the relative importance of stochastic and deterministic processes. Heterogeneous bacterial community assemblages were observed in both vertical and horizontal profiles and the differences in the bacterial community between depths were relatively significant at genus level. The higher values for the Simpson dissimilarity index (horizontal beta(SIM )= 0.59 +/- 0.02; vertical beta(SIM) = 0.48 +/- 0.03) compared to the nestedness-resultant dissimilarity index (horizontal beta(NES) = 0.05 +/- 0.02; vertical beta(NES )= 0.05 +/- 0.05) showed that species replacement explained both the vertical and horizontal beta-diversity patterns. Comparison of horizontal and vertical Sorensen dissimilarity indices further indicated that the biodiversity of vertical community deserved more attention due to the shorter geographical distance with similar beta-diversity patterns compared to horizontal assemblages. Various traditional analysis without consideration for phylogenetic turnover revealed that TN, TP, NH4+-N, DO, ORP, Conductivity and CODMn were all the related environmental factors that influenced bacterial community. However, after taking stochastic vs. deterministic processes into account, only NH4+-N and ORP were identified as the main driving forces of trends in the vertical and in the horizontal assembly of bacterial community in the polluted urban river, respectively. This study is helpful for improving ecological assessment methodology and remediation strategy for contaminated urban rivers. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Sequestration of anthropogenic antibiotics by biochars from waters may be a promising strategy to minimize environmental and human health risks of antibiotic resistance. This study investigated the long-term sequestration of lincomycin by 17 slow-pyrolysis biochars using batch sorption experiments during 365 days. Sorption kinetics were well fitted to the Weber-Morris intraparticle diffusion model for all tested biochars with the intraparticle diffusion rate constant (k(id)) of 25.3-166 mu g g(-1) day(-0.5) and intercept constant (C-id) of 39.0-339 mu g g(-1), suggesting that the sorption kinetics were controlled by fast initial sorption and slow pore diffusion. The quasi-equilibrium sorption isotherms became more nonlinear with increasing equilibration time at 1, 7, 30, and 365 days, likely due to increasing abundance of heterogeneous sorption sites in biochars over time. Intriguingly, low-temperature (300 degrees C) and high-temperature (600 degrees C) biochars had faster sorption kinetics than intermediate-temperature (400-500 degrees C) biochars at the long term, which was attributed to greater specific surface area and pore volume of high-temperature biochars and the substantial and continuous release of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from low-temperature biochars, respectively. DOC release enhanced lincomycin sorption by decreasing biochar particle size and/or increasing the accessibility of sorption sites and pores initially blocked by DOC. Additionally, a large fraction (>75%) of sorbed lincomycin in biochars after a 240-day equilibration could not be extracted by the acetonitrile/methanol extractant. The strong sorption and low extraction recovery demonstrated the great potential of biochars as soil amendments for long-term sequestration of antibiotics in-situ. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Today, two types of lamp systems dominate the UV disinfection industry: low-pressure (LP) UV lamps and medium-pressure (MP) polychromatic lamps. Both lamp types have their advantages and disadvantages in microorganism inactivation, with LP lamps being cheaper, having longer life, and working at lower temperature, hence reducing fouling, and MP lamps showing better inactivation per germicidal dose for certain microorganisms. Bacterium-based biosensors were used to compare LP and MP irradiation. These biosensors were Escherichia coli bacteria carrying the lux operon genes under the control of different stress-responding promoters, where activation of the specific promoter is manifested as bioluminescence. MP irradiation, considerably more than LP irradiation, resulted in activation of the superoxide dismutase expression, indicating the formation of superoxide radicals inside the cells. Accordingly, pre-exposure (immunization) of the bacteria to an activator that produces superoxide radicals resulted in lower inactivation and increased resistance to MP irradiation, but not to LP irradiation. This study shows that the difference in germicidal efficiency may result from the production of intracellular superoxide radicals by MP irradiation, at wavelengths other than 254 nm, as emitted by LP lamps.

AB The development of a new class of carbon electrocatalysts for nitrate reduction reaction (NRR) that have high activity and durability is extremely important, as currently reported metallic electrocatalysts show a main drawback of low stability owing to leaching and oxidation. Herein, we demonstrate that a unique N-doped graphitic carbon-encapsulated iron nanoparticles can be utilized as a promising NRR electrocatalyst. The resulting Fe(20%)@N-C achieves a better nitrate removal proportion of 83.0% (attained in the first running cycle) compared to the efficiencies of other reference catalysts, including those with lower entrapped Fe content. The nitrogen selectivity is 25.0% in the absence of Cl- and increases to 100% when supplemented with 1.0 g L-1 NaCl. More importantly, there is no statistically significant difference (at a 95% confidence interval) regarding the removal percentage recorded over 20 cycles for the Fe(20%) @N-C cathode. We propose that the iron nanoparticles could attenuate the work function on the neighboring carbon atoms, which are the reactive sites for NRR, and that the graphitic shells hinder the access of the electrolyte, thus protecting the iron particles from dissolution and oxidation. Testing with the real industrial wastewater further demonstrates the superiority of Fe(20%)@N-C cathode towards NRR, as evidenced by efficient removal of nitrate available in the biological effluent from a local coking wastewater treatment plant.

AB Populations of "Candidatus Accumulibacter", a known polyphosphate-accumulating organism, within Glade IC have been proposed to perform anoxic P-uptake activity in enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) systems using nitrate as electron acceptor. However, no consensus has been reached on the ability of "Ca. Accumulibacter" members of Glade IC to reduce nitrate to nitrite. Discrepancies might relate to the diverse operational conditions which could trigger the expression of the Nap and/or Nar enzyme and/or to the accuracy in Glade classification. This study aimed to assess whether and how certain operational conditions could lead to the enrichment and enhance the denitrification capacity of "Ca. Accumulibacter" within Glade IC. To study the potential induction of the denitrifying enzyme, an EBPR culture was enriched under anaerobic-anoxic-oxic (A2O) conditions that, based on fluorescence in situ hybridization and ppk gene sequencing, was composed of around 97% (on a biovolume basis) of affiliates of "Ca. Accumulibacter" Glade IC. The influence of the medium composition, sludge retention time (SRT), polyphosphate content of the biomass (poly-P), nitrate dosing approach, and minimal aerobic SRT on potential nitrate reduction were studied. Despite the different studied conditions applied, only a negligible anoxic P-uptake rate was observed, equivalent to maximum 13% of the aerobic P-uptake rate. An increase in the anoxic SRT at the expenses of the aerobic SRT resulted in deterioration of P-removal with limited aerobic P-uptake and insufficient acetate uptake in the anaerobic phase. A near-complete genome (completeness = 100%, contamination = 0.187%) was extracted from the metagenome of the EBPR biomass for the here-proposed "Ca. Accumulibacter delftensis" Glade IC. According to full-genomebased phylogenetic analysis, this lineage was distant from the canonical "Ca. Accumulibacter phosphatis", with closest neighbor "Ca. Accumulibacter sp. UW-LDO-IC" within Glade IC. This was cross-validated with taxonomic classification of the ppk1 gene sequences. The genome-centric metagenomic analysis highlighted the presence of genes for assimilatory nitrate reductase (nas) and periplasmic nitrate reductase (nap) but no gene for respiratory nitrate reductases (nar). This suggests that "Ca. Accumulibacter delftensis" Glade IC was not capable to generate the required energy (ATP) from nitrate under strict anaerobic-anoxic conditions to support an anoxic EBPR metabolism. Definitely, this study stresses the incongruence in denitrification abilities of "Ca. Accumulibacter" clades and reflects the true intra-clade diversity, which requires a thorough investigation within this lineage. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study focused on developing surrogate indicators for predicting oxidation of phenolic groups in dissolved organic matter (DOM), suppression of halophenols' formation potential and abatement of estrogenic activity during ozonation of water and wastewater. The evolution of pH-dependent differential absorbance spectra suggests that O-3 preferentially reacts with the DOM phenolic moieties and less so with the aromatic carboxylic groups with increasing O-3/DOC (dissolved organic carbon) ratios and changes of UV absorbance and fluorescence. When ozonation used as pretreatment, the formation of halophenols in subsequent chlorination decreased linearly with increasing O-3 doses or changes of UV absorbance until it reached 85% suppression of the halophenols' formation from unaltered DOM. The thresholds of decreases of UVA254, UVA280 and humic-like fluorescence corresponding to 85% suppression of halophenols' formation were in the range of 25%-30%, 30%-35% and 30%-45%, respectively. Pre-ozonation also showed a moderate suppression of haloacetic acids (HAAS) formation potentials, <= 26.5% for reverse osmosis isolate of Suwannee River natural organic matter and <= 31.5% for Yangtze River at applied O-3 doses. Measurement of changes of estrogenic activity during ozonation of water and wastewater showed that to attain a >90% abatement of estrogenic activity, the corresponding thresholds of decreases of UVA254, UVA280 and humic-like fluorescence were similar to 30%, similar to 40%, and similar to 70%, respectively. Bromate formation was also suppressed to below 10 mu g/L before these thresholds. This study suggests that optimal ozonation conditions and a balance between control of disinfection byproducts (halophenols, HAAS and bromate) and elimination of estrogenic activity can be reached based on online data.

AB Whereas the adsorption of organic micropollutants (OMP) onto activated carbon (AC) is relatively well studied, little is known about potential OMP desorption effects, especially in real waters. In this study, the impact of different fractions of drinking water DOM on OMP desorption from AC was examined. By different pre-treatments of a raw drinking water, a high molecular weight (hmw) and a low molecular weight (lmw) DOM solution were prepared. These solutions were used as background matrix in AC adsorption/desorption batch tests, simulating a drop of the OMP inflow concentration to a fixed-bed adsorber. The tests were conducted in parallel with three AC of different pore structures (microporous, mesoporous/balanced, macroporous). The tests were evaluated with respect to the extent of OMP adsorption and its reversibility, which represents the potential extent of OMP desorption. In terms of OMP adsorption, the lmw-DOM fraction induced a higher competitive effect on OMP adsorption in comparison to the hmw-DOM fraction. In terms of their impact on OMP desorption extent, both fractions led to very similar results. In case of the macroporous AC, both DOM fractions induce an enhanced OMP desorption that can be attributed to displacement effects in both cases. For the microporous AC, an increased irreversibility of OMP adsorption was found in both cases, which shows that DOM adsorption prevents OMP desorption, independently of the size of the adsorbed DOM compounds. Whereas results from this study as well as from former studies indicate that this effect might be induced by permanent pore blockages by adsorbed DOM, further results show that there could be more complex DOM interactions that lead to the decreased desorption in case of microporous AC. Nonetheless, the very similar impact of the different DOM fractions on the reversibility of OMP adsorption indicates that the potential extent of desorption is similar in different waters (with different DOM composition) and primarily depending on the pore structure of the used AC.

AB Access to near-real time opioid use data is essential to the effective management of the U.S. opioid crisis. Current narcotic data collection methods are limited by time delay and would be complimented by a rapid data acquisition technique. Use of wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) analysis may offer access to near real-time data on opioid consumption but application in the United States has been limited. From 2015 to 2017, monthly 24-h time-weighted composite samples of municipal raw wastewater from two Midwestern U.S. cities were routinely analyzed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for morphine, codeine, oxycodone, heroin, fentanyl, and select opioid metabolites. Concentrations of opioids (ng/L) in raw wastewater from City 1 and 2, respectively, were: morphine (713 +/- 38; 306 +/- 29; detection frequency (DF): 100%), oxycodone (17.8 +/- 1.1; 78 +/- 6; DF: 100%), codeine (332 +/- 37; 100 +/- 27; DF: 93%), heroin (41 +/- 16; 9 +/- 11; DF: 81%), and fentanyl (1.7 +/- 0.2; 1.0 +/- 0.5; DF: 62%). Average opioid consumption rates estimated using WBE ranged between 9 and 2590 mg/day/1000 persons. Anticipated overdoses and overdose-deaths calculated from analyte concentrations in wastewater forecasted 200 opioid-related overdoses/year and 39 opioid related overdose-deaths/year across the two cities during the year 2016, which aligned well with observed coroner-reported opioid deaths. This long-term U.S. screening study of opioids in wastewater was the first to utilize wastewater epidemiological data to estimate the number of expected overdose and overdose-deaths, and to identify detectable levels of the powerful synthetic opioid fentanyl in community wastewater consistently over the course of one whole year.

AB When adequately treated, grey water represents a potent alternative water resource, as it constitutes a large proportion of household wastewater. The objective of this paper was to test a full scale version of a novel compact grey water treatment technology, based on passive aeration and particle trapping in multiple layers. Using a modified dual porosity filtration technology, grey water from a public bath was passed through a stack of eight reactors, each 0.75 m x 0.55 x 0.22 m, serially connected for gravity driven flow from top to bottom in a zig-zag pattern. The topmost reactor served as pre-filter for removal of hair and other larger debris. The lower seven reactors facilitated degradation of bulk organic contaminants in biofilm established on a stack of five fibrous polyamide nets, and trapping of particles by sedimentation on five interlaid corrugated plastic plates. By operating the reactors in a time-controlled batch-mode, the corrugated plates further served to trap air and thus ensure passive aeration of the subsequent batch. The production rate was 1.2 m(3)/d and the hydraulic retention time 2 h, at an aerial footprint of 0.4 m(2), excluding storage tanks. After two weeks of initialization, a biofilm had established and the system was monitored for additionally three weeks. Significantly improved effluent quality was obtained as measured from reductions in turbidity (95%), total suspended solids (94%), chemical oxygen demand (87%), and microbiological parameters (55-98%), and from stable level of dissolved oxygen in effluent of 3.5 mg/L. Future optimization includes custom-made reactors for maximizing production capacity, improved removal of total N and total P, and addition of final disinfection. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this study, we examined eight typical and widely detected pharmaceuticals (PhAs) removal in an anaerobic sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) sludge system (five antibiotics: sulfadiazine (SD), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), trimethoprim (TMP), ciprofloxacin (CIP) and enoxacin (ENO), and three nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): ibuprofen (IBU), ketoprofen (KET) and diclofenac (DIC)). The results showed that the SRB sludge had the higher removal efficacy (20 to 90%) for antibiotics (SD, SMX, TMP, CIP and ENO) than NSAIDs (<20%) via adsorption and biodegradation under different operating conditions. Based on a series of batch studies, fluoroquinolone antibiotics (CIP and ENO) were instantly (<15 min) removed (similar to 98%) via adsorption on SRB sludge with adsorption coefficient (K-d) as high as 25.3 +/- 1.8 L/g-suspended solids (SS). And thermodynamics results indicated that the adsorption of CIP and ENO on SRB sludge was spontaneous (Gibbs free energy change (Delta G degrees) <0 kJ/mol), exothermic (enthalpy change (Delta H degrees) <0 kJ/mol), and the adsorption process involved both physisorption and chemisorption (absolute value of Delta H degrees = 20 to 80 kJ/mol). Three widely prescribed antibiotics (SMX, TMP and an) were further investigated for their possible biodegradation pathways along with functional enzymes involved through a series of batch experiments. The biotransformation intermediates indicated that biotransformations of SMX and CIP in SRB sludge system could be initiated from the cleavage of isoxazole and piperazinyl rings catalyzed by sulfite reductase (SR) and cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes, respectively. TMP was likely biotransformed via O-demethylation and N-acetylation coupled with hydroxylation reactions with CYP450 enzymes as the main functional enzymes. This study provided new insight into PhAs removal in SRB sludge system, and has significant potential of implementing sulfur-mediated biological process for the treatment of PhAs containing wastewater.

AB The property and release behavior of phosphorus in biochar derived from enhanced biological phosphorus removal sludge (EBPR sludge) were investigated. A low-temperature-steam (LTS) activation method was developed to increase the P availability in the biochar. The results demonstrate that the P content in the biochar is comparable to that in typical P fertilizers. The biochar contained a considerable portion of fast-release P. Polyphosphates (poly-P) were the predominant P species in the biochar. LTS greatly improved P availability in biochar produced at 700 degrees C by hydrolyzing insoluble poly-P to soluble pyro-P and ortho-P. In addition, the presence of Ca2+ could greatly reduce the P-release from biochar produced at lower temperature, e.g. 400 degrees C, due to that Ca2+ could facilitate the precipitation/adsorption of orthophosohates/pyrophosphates released from the low temperature biochars. Such phenomena was not observed with high temperature biochar, as the soluble poly-P released from 700 degrees C biochar could complex with Ca2+ rather than precipitated with it. Other environmental conditions, i.e., environmental pH, ionic strength of the soil porewater, and presence of low-molecular-weight acid, only had minor or negligible effects on the P-release of most studied biochars. This study concludes that LTS-activated-700 degrees C biochar could be a promising P fertilizer given its high, rapid, and unaffected P-release under various environmentally relevant conditions.

AB A literature-based, manually-curated database of PCR primers for the detection of antibiotic resistance genes in various environments was constructed (LCPDb-ARG; lcpdb.ddg.biol.uw.edu.pl and lcpdb. ddlemb.com). Currently, this database is comprised of 607 PCR primer pairs designed for the amplification of various genes conferring resistance to antibiotics representing 10 classes of antimicrobial agents. Three parameters were assigned for each primer pair: specificity, efficacy and taxonomic efficacy. These parameters were evaluated using a novel bioinformatic tool, UniPriVal, developed for this study. UniPriVal was used to validate each primer pair against various databases, including the Bacterial Antimicrobial Resistance Reference Gene Database (BARRGDB) and those of the National Center of Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Primer pairs specific for each antibiotic resistance gene were ranked based on their model success metric value. To validate the utility and correctness of the information collected in the LCPDb-ARG, selected primer pairs were tested in bioinformatic and experimental PCR surveys. To our knowledge, this is the first database designed to facilitate PCR monitoring of the occurrence and diversity of antibiotic resistance genes in environmental and clinical samples. The internal validation system of this user-friendly application enables the quantified ranking of PCR primer pairs, which assists selection of the best primers for each application.

AB Hyporheic zones are increasingly thought of as natural bioreactors, capable of transforming and attenuating groundwater pollutants present in diffuse baseflow. An underappreciated scenario in the understanding of contaminant fate in hyporheic zones is the interaction between point-source trichloroethene (TCE) plumes and ubiquitous, non-point source pollutants such as nitrate. This study aims to conceptualise critical biogeochemical gradients in the hyporheic zone which govern the export potential of these redox-sensitive pollutants from carbon-poor, oxic aquifers. Within the TCE plume discharge zone, discrete vertical profiling of the upper 100 cm of sediment pore water chemistry revealed an 80% increase in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and 20-60 cm thick hypoxic zones (<2 mg O-2 L-1) within which most reactive transport was observed. A 33% reduction of nitrate concentrations coincided with elevated pore water nitrous oxide concentrations as well as the appearance of manganese and the TCE metabolite cis-1,2-dichloroethene (cDCE). Elevated groundwater nitrate concentrations (>50 mg L-1) create a large stoichiometric demand for bioavailable DOC in discharging groundwater. With the benefit of a high-resolution grid of pore water samplers investigating the shallowest 30 cm of hypoxic groundwater flow paths, we identified DOC-rich hotspots associated with submerged vegetation (Ranunculus spp.), where low-energy metabolic processes such as mineral dissolution/reduction, methanogenesis and ammonification dominate. Using a chlorine index metric, we show that enhanced TCE to cDCE transformation takes place within these biogeochemical hotspots, highlighting their relevance for natural plume attenuation.

AB Bacterial diversity and antimicrobial resistance patterns among the indicator organism Escherichia coli were monitored in wastewater samples collected over one year from a hospital (HW), a community (CW) and the receiving urban (UW) wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). We compared levels of antibiotic resistance in the different types of wastewater, and identified whether resistant strains were endemic in the wastewater system. If so, implementation of local treatment at certain resistance hotspots (e.g. hospital outlets) could be used to decrease the amount of resistant bacteria in the wastewater. E. coli from HW (n = 2644), CW (n = 2525) and UW (n = 2693) were analyzed by biochemical phenotyping (PhenePlate System) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing to nine antibiotics (AREB System). The phenotypic diversities of the total E. coli populations were similar for all three sites (Simpson's Diversity index, Di = 0.973), however for individual samples, HW showed low diversities (Median Di = 0.800) and the E. coli flora was often dominated by strains that may have originated from the fecal flora of single individuals. The diversities in CW samples was higher (Median Di = 0.936), and UW samples showed similar diversities as the whole collection of isolates (Median Di = 0.971). Resistance to at least one of the nine antibiotics was observed in 45% of the HW isolates, 44% of CW isolates, and 33% of UW isolates. Resistance to gentamicin and chloramphenicol was uncommon (3.2 and 5.3%, respectively), whereas resistance to tetracycline and ampicillin was most common (24% and 31%, respectively). Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli (ESBL-EC) were more common in HW (11.5%) and in CW (6.9%) compared to UW (3.7%). A high diversity (Di = 0.974) was observed among ESBL-EC isolates from UW (n = 99), indicating absence of any clonal structure among these isolates. Common PhP types of ESBL-EC often dominated in each HW sample, but were not identified across different samples, whereas ESBL-EC in CW showed low diversity (Di = 0.857) and were dominated by a specific PhP type that was found across almost all CW samples. The antibiotic resistance rates were highest in hospital wastewater, but surprisingly they were also high in the studied community wastewater, compared to the urban wastewater. The relative contribution of HW seemed low in terms of dissemination of antibiotic resistant bacteria to the WWTP. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB IWA Anaerobic Digestion Model No. 1 (ADM1) is the most widely recognised and popular mathematical model for anaerobic digestion processes. However, the application of ADM1 to acidogenic fermentation is limited by its use of constant stoichiometry to describe the formation of products via carbohydrate fermentation. This study presents a modification of ADM1 using a variable acidogenic stoichiometric approach in which the hydrogen partial pressure (pH2) and pH are used to predict and regulate the acidogenic process. The fermentation of ethanol and its kinetics were introduced into the model structure. Experimental data from mixed acid-type fermentation in a 28.4 L anaerobic baffled reactor (ABR) fed with a sucrose solution with a chemical oxygen demand of 4000 mg L-1 were used to calibrate the model parameters. Two case studies involving continuous ethanol-type fermentation in an ABR and a continuous stirring tank reactor (CSTR) were used to validate the approach. The modified model achieved good predictions of the experimental data collected from butyric acid, propionic acid, mixed acid, and ethanol-type fermentation in the ABR and CSTR using the standard ADM1 parameter values without any parameter fitting beyond implementation of the variable acidogenic stoichiometry. The pH2 and pH thresholds in butyric acid, propionic acid, mixed acid, and ethanol-type fermentation could be predicted using this model, which was shown to be a valid mathematical tool for the regulation of fermentation type.

AB While the visible-light-driven photocatalytic disinfection techniques for drinking water have recently attracted tremendous attentions, it is necessary to further improve the solar energy utilization efficiency. In this study, we synthesized Pb-BiFeO3 photocatalysts doped with different amounts of reduced graphene oxide (Pb-BiFeO3/rGO). The photocatalytic disinfection efficiencies toward gram-negative Escherichia coli (E. coli) and gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) were evaluated under visible-light irradiation (lambda >= 400 nm). The results indicated that Pb-BiFeO3 with 0.5 wt% rGO (Pb-BiFeO3/0.5% rGO) exhibited the highest disinfection efficiency. Complete inactivation was reached within 30 min and 90 min for E. coli and S. aureus, respectively. The transcriptomic analysis results indicated that Pb-BiFeO3/0.5% rGO deregulates the genes in E. coli cells that are involved in the cell membrane damage and oxidative stress responses. This was validated by the cell leakage of nucleic acids or proteins, transmission electron microscopy images of the bacteria, and the disinfection efficiency decrease caused by the introduction of scavenger of hydroxyl radical (HO center dot). Metal ions (Pb2+, Bi2+, and Fe3+) released from the photocatalysts did not contribute to the disinfection process. For the first time, our results elucidated that the photocatalytic disinfection mechanism of Pb-BiFeO3/rGO toward E. coli was mainly associated with oxidative stress due to HO center dot generation and the loss of membrane integrity from direct contact with the photocatalyst. After four consecutive cycles, the Pb-BiFeO3/0.5% rGO photocatalyst exhibited a strong antibacterial efficiency.

AB The underlying physical and biogeochemical mechanisms associated with low dissolved oxygen (DO) levels below 5 mg L-1 were examined through field data analyses and water quality modeling of the lower 40 miles of the Minnesota River. Insights into flow and water quality data of nineteen years (1999 -2017) at five sites demonstrate that low DO levels parallel the obvious longitudinal (upstream-to-downstream) decline in phytoplankton biomass and increase in ammonium nitrogen (NH4) and dissolved orthophosphate (PO4) in the last 22-mile river reach (i.e., navigation channel) during late summer low flow conditions. River discharge is inversely related to the magnitude of the longitudinal change in DO, phytoplankton biomass, NH4 and PO4, indicating that the late summer low flow hydrodynamics in the navigation channel with a longer residence time, deeper water and slower velocity provide an extended opportunity for the biogeochemical reactions involving phytoplankton, DO and nutrients. Moreover, the ratio of the longitudinal decline in DO versus the longitudinal increase in NH4 is particularly close to the Redfield O:N ratio, suggesting that the decline in DO and increase in nutrients most likely result from the decomposition of phytoplankton detritus under aerobic conditions. This is further proved by the water quality modeling of the lower Minnesota River. The primary reasons for impaired water quality are substantially elevated sediment oxygen consumption and nutrient release derived from the decomposition of settled phytoplankton detritus in the navigation channel. Therefore, we recommend that active prevention of abrupt phytoplankton blooms and collapses through regulation of river discharge and local hydrodynamics may assist in maintaining acceptable water quality in eutrophic rivers with a high level of phytoplankton biomass.

AB With the growth in production and use of chemicals and the fact that many end up in the aquatic environment, there is an increasing need for advanced water treatment technologies that can remove chemicals of emerging concern (CECs) from water. The current lack of a homogenous approach for testing advanced water treatment technologies hampers the interpretation and evaluation of CEC removal efficiency data, and hinders informed decision making by stakeholders with regard to which treatment technology could satisfy their specific needs.
   Here a data evaluation framework is proposed to improve the use of current knowledge in the field of advanced water treatment technologies for drinking water and wastewater, consisting of a set of 9 relevance criteria and 51 reliability criteria. The two criteria sets underpin a thorough, unbiased and standardised method to select studies to evaluate and compare CEC removal efficiency of advanced water treatment technologies in a scientifically sound way.
   The relevance criteria set was applied to 244 papers on removal efficiency, of which only 20% fulfilled the criteria. The reliability criteria were applied to the remaining papers. In general these criteria were fulfilled with regards to information on the target compound, the water matrix and the treatment process conditions. However, there was a lack of information on data interpretation and statistics.
   In conclusion, a minority of the evaluated papers are suited for comparison across techniques, compounds and water matrixes. There is a clear need for more uniform reporting of water treatment studies for CEC removal. In the future this will benefit the selection of appropriate technologies. (C) 2019 The Authors.

AB The carbonate radical (CO3 center dot-) is a strong oxidative radical that is generated via the reactions of HCO3-/ CO32- with hydroxyl radical (HO center dot) or triplet states of dissolved organic matter ((DOM)-D- 3*) in sunlit surface water. The bimolecular reaction rate constants of CO3 center dot- with various DOM isolates (k(CO3)(center dot-), DOM) were calculated as 15-239 (mg of C/L) (-1)s(-1) and were correlate to the bulk DOM properties, such as the content of phenolic moieties, the specific UV absorbance (SUVA), the E2/E3 value, and the fluorescence index (FI). The spectroscopic E2/E3 values was found to strongly correlated (R-2 = 0.93) with k CO3(center dot-), DOM , and an empirical equation was established. Our results also demonstrate that CO(3)(center dot-)is involved in the photobleaching of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and in particular reacts with electron-donor moieties, leading to faster decay rates at long wavelengths of UV-vis absorption. Furthermore, a model was developed to calculate the steady-state concentrations of CO3 center dot- during DOM photobleaching. These results allow us to estimate the reactivity of DOM with CO3 center dot- and to evaluate the role of CO3 center dot- in sunlit surface water. It will also allow a better assessment of the concentration and utilization of CO3 center dot- during the application of advanced oxidation processes. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study evaluated the anti-biofouling efficacy of capacitor mode and resistor mode in membrane distillation (MD). Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane coated with carbon nanotube (CNT) was adopted as the electrically conductive membrane. The biofouling formation on the pre-treatment membrane was systematically analyzed, and the results showed that both operation modes had obvious inhabitation on bacteria, especially the capacitor mode exhibited stronger prevention capability on biomass accumulation than resistor mode. NMDs analysis of microbial communities further revealed that the anti-biofouling effect mainly occurred on the membrane surface, and gram-positive biomarkers which can survive better in external electric field was distinctively found in capacitor mode through LEM analysis. Hypothesis was introduced to explain the anti-fouling function of two modes that in the capacitor mode, the competitive electrostatic repulsion of bacteria cells on negative electrode associated by the cell-disruption effect of electro-catalyzed reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, while the anti-fouling function of resistor mode was a result of temperature increment on membrane surface caused by Joule heating effects. This article attempts to provide an insight of anti-fouling mechanism of electric field applied in MD and to prove the feasibility of above-mentioned operation modes as non-chemical methods for optimization of membrane-based water treatment process.

AB In this study, oxytetracycline (OTC) as a target pollutant in swine wastewater was removed by aerobic granular sludge (AGS). The removal rate of 300 mu g/L OTC in aerobic granular sludge sequencing batch reactor (AGSBR) increased to 88.00% in 33 days and maintained stable. The chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N) and total phosphorus (TP) in wastewater were also efficiently removed. The removal of OTC mainly depended on the adsorption and biodegradation of AGS, and the biodegradation was increased obviously after AGS adaptation to OTC. The degradation products of OTC were analyzed by mass spectrometry. The analysis of metagenome sequencing revealed that the enzymes, such as glycosyl transferases (GTs), polysaccharide lyases (PLs) and auxiliary activities (AAs), may play an important role in the removal of OTC. The Lefse analysis showed that the Flavobacteriia, Flavobacteriales, Cryomorphaceae and Fluviicola were four kinds of microbes with significant difference in OTC feed reactor, which are considered to be drug-resistant bacteria in AGSBR. Furthermore, the dynamics of microbial community changed significantly at three levels, including the enrichment of drug-resistant microorganisms and the microorganisms that gradually reduced or even disappeared under the pressure of OTC.

AB Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), linking human fecal residues and the environment, are considered as hotspots for the spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). In order to evaluate the role of WWTPs and underlying operational parameters for the removal of AMR, the presence and removal efficiency of a selected set of 6 antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) and 2 mobile genetic elements (MGEs) was evaluated by means of qPCR in influent and effluent samples from 62 Dutch WWTPs. The role of possible factors impacting the concentrations of ARGs and MGEs in the influent and their removal was identified through statistical analysis. ARGs and the class I integron-integrase gene (intI1) were, on average, removed to a similar extent (1.76 log reduction) or better (+0.30-1.90 logs) than the total bacteria (measured as 16S rRNA gene). In contrast, broad-host-range plasmids (IncP-1) had a significantly increased (p < 0.001) relative abundance after treatment. The presence of healthcare institutions in the area served did only slightly increase the concentrations of ARGs or MGEs in influent. From the extended panel of operational parameters, rainfall, increasing the hydraulic load of the plant, most significantly (p < 0.05) affected the treatment efficiency by decreasing it on average -0.38 logs per time the flow exceeded the average daily flow. Our results suggest that overall, WWTP treatments do not favor the proliferation of the assessed resistance genes but might increase the relative abundance of broad-host-range plasmids of the IncP-1 type.

   IMPACT
AB Anaerobic digestion (AD) is a technology for recovering chemical energy as methane from excess sludge/waste. Unfortunately, humic acids (HA) contained in excess sludge can have the effects of inhibiting the efficiency of energy conversion. Based on a batch experiment, the impact of HA on a semi-continuous AD process was sequentially investigated, with the impact on the associated enzymes and microorganisms being measured. The results of this semi-continuous experiment indicate that the inhibition of the microbial community increased with an increased HA:VSS ratio. Long-term cultivation did not result in the adaption of methane production to the presence of HA. Moreover, at HA:VSS = 20%, the strongest inhibition (74.3%) on energy conversion efficiency was observed in the semi-continuous experiment, which was two-fold higher than that recorded in the batch experiment. This is attributed to serious and irreversible inhibition of both acidogenic and methanogenic microorganisms, as well as the physical-chemical reactions between HA and the associated enzymes which, it was concluded, were the dominant mechanisms of inhibition in the batch experiment.

AB Our objective was to determine whether beta-lactamase genes are carried within bacteriophage capsids, as a first step towards exploring the possible role of bacteriophages as vehicles for dispersal of antimicrobial resistance genes through an agricultural region of Washington State. Water samples (n = 178) from municipal wastewater treatment plants, river and irrigation canals were collected over a period of eight months. The occurrence of four beta-lactam resistance gene groups (bla(TEM), bla(CTX-M), bla(PSE) and bla(CMY-2)) and three carbapenem resistance genes (bla(KPC), bla(OXA-48)-like, and bia(NDM)) in bacterial and phage fractions of water samples was evaluated by PCR. All of the seven targeted resistance genes were detected both in wastewater and river water samples. Relatively high proportions of samples (7.3%-64.9%) positive for resistance genes were found in bacteriophage fractions of water samples compared to the bacterial fractions (5.4%-36.8%). bla(OXA-48)-like (57.3%) and bla(TEM) (64.0%) were the most prevalent antimicrobial resistance genes detected at all the sampling points. Resistance genes are commonly present in treated wastewater flowing through municipal and agricultural environments, indicating a plausible role for this water in the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance traits, including bla(CTX-M).

AB The formation potential of contaminants diffusing from cross-linked polyethylene (PE-X) pipes and their impact on the odour of drinking water was determined. Three types of PE-X material, Pe-Xa, PE-Xb and PE-Xc, were extensively assessed by performing migration tests following EN 1420 and EN 12873-1. Migration waters were analysed for their threshold odour number (TON). The same samples were investigated by two gas chromatography-mass spectrometry methods: screening and olfactometry. Most of the PE-X materials failed the German regulation of TON <2 for cold water and TON <= 4 for warm water. PE-Xb material caused the strongest odour and also released the highest amount of contaminants. Metilox, 7,9-di-tert-butyl-1-oxaspiro(4,5)deca-6,9-diene-2,8-dione, 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxybenzaldehyde and 2,6-di-tert-butyl-p-benzoquinone (2,6-DtBQ) were the most often detected substances leaching from the tested plastic materials. However, no odour was perceived for most of these substances. Methyl tert-butyl ether (MtBE) and 2-tert-butylphenol are believed to contribute to the sensory problem in the migration water among other substances such as tert-amyl methyl ether, 2,2,2,5-tetramethyltetrahydrofuran, toluene or xylene. In total ten specific descriptions characterized the odour of the individual contaminants: ethereal, fresh, solvent, sweet, fruity, floral, unsavoury, pungent, aromatic and chemical.

AB The photo-Fenton process application to eliminate carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae, an antibiotic-resistant priority pathogen, was evaluated. Initially, reagents concentration effect was tested and under suitable conditions (5 mg L-1 of Fe2+ and 50 mg L-1 of H2O2) complete bacteria inactivation by action of hydroxyl radical and UVA plus hydrogen peroxide was achieved at 120 min. The process presented a strong residual disinfecting effect when light was turned off at only 20 min. Besides, the cultivability of treated K. pneumoniae in a selective medium containing carbapenem antibiotics was considered. bla-KPC, gene responsible for the resistance, evolution was also assessed. The bacteria response to carbapenem antibiotics was higher as the treatment time increased. In turn, bla-KPC gene remained when K. pneumoniae was completely inactivated (120 min); nevertheless, treatment times longer than 120 min diminished bla-KPC presence. Finally, the photo-Fenton process and its modifications (citric acid addition or persulfate anion instead hydrogen peroxide) were applied to a real hospital wastewater in Colombia. In such complex matrix, the conventional photo-Fenton system reached a moderate disinfection (similar to 3.5 log-units at 300 min). Meanwhile, in presence of citric acid total inactivation was completed at the same time. Interestingly, the H2O2 substitution by persulfate strongly accelerated the microorganism elimination, achieving the 6-log-units reduction after only 60 min of process action. Thus, the effective elimination of K. pneumoniae from water by the modified photo-Fenton evidenced the potential applicability of this process to limit the proliferation of antibiotic resistant bacteria.

AB The influence of dendrimer on the bacterial transport and deposition behaviors in saturated porous media (quartz sand) was investigated in both NaCl (10 and 25 mM) and CaCl2 solutions (1.2 and 5 mM). 3.5G and 4G poly (amido amine) (PAMAM) dendrimer was employed as negatively and positively charged dendrimer, respectively. Three dendrimer concentrations (10 mu g/L, 1 and 10 mg/L) were considered in present study. We found that regardless of the solution chemistry (ionic strength and ion types) and dendrimer concentrations, the presence of negatively charged PAMAM 3.5G in suspensions enhanced bacterial transport and inhibited their deposition in quartz sand; while the presence of positive charged PAMAM 4G yet induced the opposite effects (decreased bacterial transport and increased their deposition in quartz sand). The increased repulsive force between cell and quartz sand due to the adsorption of PAMAM 3.5G onto both cell and sand surfaces, the competition deposition sites as well as the steric repulsion via the suspended PAMAM 3.5G drove to the increased bacterial transport with PAMAM 3.5G copresent in suspensions in quartz sand. While the reduced repulsive force between cell and quartz sand induced by the chemical heterogeneity on both cell and sand surfaces (due to the adsorption of positive charged PAMAM 4G) increased bacterial retention in quartz sand with copresence of PAMAM 4G (10 mu g/L. and 1 mg/L) in suspensions. Steric repulsion due to the presence of great amount of suspended PAMAM 4G yet lead to the enhanced bacterial transport with furthering increasing PAMAM 4G to 10 mg/L relative to the lower PAMAM 4G concentration.

AB Due to the importance of analyzing the efficiency of water utilities and the large number of publications in this area, at least five reviews have already been carried out to identify patterns and trends. These reviews aimed to cover worldwide studies, and the results may not correspond to the reality in developing countries. Therefore, this review provides a literature update on the quantitative studies of water and sanitation services, focusing on studies carried out in developing countries. This overview mainly examines the economies of scale and scope, public versus private ownership, and the impact of regulation. As expected, our results show patterns that differ from those found in worldwide reviews (e.g., the influence of regulatory incentives on operator efficiency and economies of scope). In addition, this paper presents patterns regarding the quantitative methods adopted, as well as some trends and areas for possible future research. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Calcium phosphate scaling is one of the main limitations in effluent desalination using membranes. This may be overcome by tailoring membranes with lower rejection of the scalant ions.
   In this study, we systematically examined the use of negatively and positively charged membranes, rejecting ions mainly based on Donnan exclusion, as a low-scaling alternative to dielectric-exclusiondominated polyamide NF membranes for effluent desalination.
   The two charged membranes exhibited a lower calcium and especially phosphate rejection than the polyamide membrane. Consequently, the calcium phosphate supersaturation and then the propensity to scaling of the charged membranes were much lower than the polyamide membrane. This also allowed filtering at a much higher recovery ratio with the charged membranes. It was also found that, despite the fact that the charged membranes had an opposite fixed charge, their scaling behavior was similar. Apparently, although these membranes showed opposite selectivity towards scalant ions (phosphate and calcium) in single salt solutions, the rejection pattern in mixed salt solutions resulted in similar saturation indices, much lower than for polyamide membrane.
   The scale formed on all three membranes was identified as amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP), although its saturation index was lower than its solubility factor. This was explained by concentration polarization which increases the saturation index in the solution adjacent to the membrane surface.
   Tests in absence of permeate flux showed a much slower precipitation that took a few days compared with filtration conditions (few hours). In addition, under these conditions, the effect of the scaling on the membrane permeability was generally reduced and the scale contained crystalline calcium phosphate products, different from ACP.
   The results indicate that the ion rejection and resulting polarization next to the membrane surface plays a crucial role in scaling. Thus, tuning ion selectivity of NF membranes towards scalant ions presents a promising alternative for scaling mitigation during effluent desalination. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Direct nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions during the biological nitrogen removal (BNR) processes can significantly increase the carbon footprint of wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) operations. Recent onsite measurement of N2O emissions at WWTPs have been used as an alternative to the controversial theoretical methods for the N2O calculation. The full-scale N2O monitoring campaigns help to expand our knowledge on the N2O production pathways and the triggering operational conditions of processes. The accurate N2O monitoring could help to find better process control solutions to mitigate N2O emissions of wastewater treatment systems. However, quantifying the emissions and understanding the long-term behaviour of N2O fluxes in WWTPs remains challenging and costly.
   A review of the recent full-scale N2O monitoring campaigns is conducted. The analysis covers the quantification and mitigation of emissions for different process groups, focusing on techniques that have been applied for the identification of dominant N2O pathways and triggering operational conditions, techniques using operational data and N2O data to identify mitigation measures and mechanistic modelling. The analysis of various studies showed that there are still difficulties in the comparison of N2O emissions and the development of emission factor (EF) databases; the N2O fluxes reported in literature vary significantly even among groups of similar processes. The results indicated that the duration of the monitoring campaigns can impact the EF range. Most N2O monitoring campaigns lasting less than one month, have reported N2O EFs less than 0.3% of the N-load, whereas studies lasting over a year have a median EF equal to 1.7% of the N-load. The findings of the current study indicate that complex feature extraction and multivariate data mining methods can efficiently convert wastewater operational and N2O data into information, determine complex relationships within the available datasets and boost the longterm understanding of the N2O fluxes behaviour. The acquisition of reliable full-scale N2O monitoring data is significant for the calibration and validation of the mechanistic models -describing the N2O emission generation in WWTPs. They can be combined with the multivariate tools to further enhance the interpretation of the complicated full-scale N2O emission patterns. Finally, a gap between the identification of effective N2O mitigation strategies and their actual implementation within the monitoring and control of WWTPs has been identified. This study concludes that there is a further need for i) long-term N2O monitoring studies, ii) development of data-driven methodological approaches for the analysis of WWTP operational and N2O data, and iii) better understanding of the trade-offs among N2O emissions, energy consumption and system performance to support the optimization of the WWTPs operation.

AB In this study, sources of recharge and contamination in urban groundwater and in groundwater underneath a forest in the same aquifer were determined and compared. Data on hydro-chemical parameters and stable isotopes of water were collected in urban and forest springs in the Kharkiv region, Ukraine, over a period of 12 months. Groundwater transit time and precipitation contribution were calculated using hydrogeological data and stable isotopes of water to delineate groundwater recharge conditions. Hydro-chemical data, stable isotopes and emerging contaminants were used to trace anthropogenic groundwater recharge and approximate sewage and tap water contributions to the aquifer. The results indicated that each spring had unique isotopic signatures that could be explained by recharge conditions, groundwater residence time, and specific mixing patterns with sewage and water leaks. Elevated nitrate content, stable isotopes of nitrate, and the presence of emerging pollutants (mainly illicit drugs) in most of the urban springs confirmed mixing of urban groundwater with sewage leaks. These leaks amounted to up to 25% of total recharge and exhibited seasonal variations in some springs. Overall, the results show that urban groundwater receives variable seasonal contributions of anthropogenic components that increase the risk to the environment and human health, and reduce its usability for drinking water production. The multi-tracing approach presented can be useful for other cities worldwide that have similar problems of poor water management and inadequate sewage and water supply infrastructure.

AB The ecological responses of riverine ecosystems are strongly influenced by anthropogenic perturbations. However, high-resolution quantitative shifts in the 'ecosystem responses' to multiple human pressures in riverine ecosystems are not well understood. Given that, in most of the anthropogenically impacted rivers, eutrophy and metal pollution occur simultaneously, we explored FDAase activity, microbial quotient, and a sum of six heavy metals in an empirical relationship to develop an 'ecological response index' (ERI). The FDAase, a measure of fluorescein diacetate hydrolytic activity, and microbial quotient, the proportion of microbial biomass-C to the total organic carbon (C-mic/TOC) were used to address 'ecosystem responses' to C-eutrophy and metal pollution. We analyzed 1404 water samples and 2808 sediment samples collected from the land-water interface (LWI) and riverbed sediment (50 m reach) of 24 sites along a 528 km main stem and from 30 sites downstream two point sources of the Ganga River. The index was compare to Carlson's trophic state index (TSI) to quantify eutrophy and HAkanson's risk index (RI) and modified ecological risk index (MRI) for metal pollution. The ERI showed strong correlation with TSI (R-2 = 0.70-0.97; p < 0.001), RI (R-2 = 0.76-0.94; p < 0.001) and MRI (R-2 = 0.76-0.96; p < 0.001). The ERI developed here is the first 'response index' against multiple human pressures, able to quantitatively predict C-eutrophication and metal pollution simultaneously in large rivers.

AB Vacuum ultraviolet/ultraviolet/chlorine (VUV/UV/chlorine) is considered a novel advanced oxidation process (AOP), but little is known about its kinetics for pollutant degradation in water treatment. This study investigated the degradation of six typical pesticides, namely dimethoate (DMT), atrazine (ATZ), prometon (PMT), propoxur (PPX), bromacil (BRM) and propachlor (PPC), by VUV/UV/chlorine. The results show that all pesticides were rapidly degraded by VUV/UV/chlorine with a high removal efficiency of over 95% after 60 s. The pesticide degradation fitted well with pseudo-first-order reaction kinetics and a significant synergistic effect was observed during the VUV/UV/chlorine process. The synergistic factor (F-V/U/Cl) for DMT, ATZ, PMT, PPX, BRM and PPC were determined to be 1.75, 1.70, 2.06, 1.57, 2.84 and 1.61, respectively, indicating a synergistic improvement of 57%-184% for all pesticides. As hydroxyl radical (HO center dot) transformed into reactive chlorine species (RCSs), the contribution ratio of RCSs for the pesticide degradation was much higher than that of HO center dot in the VUV/UV/chlorine process, thus causing the synergistic effect. Solution pH ranging from 5.0 to 10.0 had various influence on the pesticide degradation by VUV/UV/chlorine. As initial concentration of free chlorine increased from 0 to 0.25 mM, the apparent rate constants of the pesticides kept on increasing while the F-V/U/Cl first increased and reached the highest value, and decreased afterwards. The formation of nitrite was significantly inhibited during the degradation of all pesticides by VUV/UV/chlorine. It suggests that VUV/UV/chlorine is a promising AOP for the pesticide degradation in water treatment. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The photolysis of chlorine by UV light leads to the formation of the hydroxyl radicals (OH) as well as reactive chlorine species (RCS) that can be effective as advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) for water treatment. Much of the research to date has been done at laboratory- or bench-scale. This study reports results from a model that demonstrates that the relative effectiveness of the UV/Cl-2 AOP compared to the more traditional UV/H2O2 AOP is a function of optical path length. As such, the relative effectiveness of the two treatment options evaluated at small scale may not reflect the relative performance at full-scale, making results previously obtained at small-scale potentially less scalable. This study therefore compares the performance of UV/Cl-2 to UV/H2O2 at a full-scale water treatment plant, using sucralose and caffeine as spiked surrogates for contaminants that are reactive solely to OH radicals, and to both OH and RCS, respectively. pH was varied between 6.5 and 8.0. The results demonstrated that when using a medium pressure UV lamp, UV/Cl-2 might lead to approximately twice the production of OH radicals as UV/H2O2 at pH 6.5 when using the same molar oxidant concentration, but adding chlorine to the UV reactor at pH 8.0 had a negligible impact on OH radical concentration in comparison to UV alone. The study also confirmed previous small-scale results that RCS can be a major contributor to UV/Cl-2 treatment for compounds such as caffeine that are susceptible to RCS, with UV/Cl-2 effective at both pH 6.5 and 8.0 for such compounds. Disinfection byproducts were monitored, with adsorbable organohalide (AOX) formation increasing by approximately 10 mu g-Cl/L due to chlorine photolysis, but only at pH 6.5 and not at pH 8.0. This implies that UV/Cl-2 might increase AOX mostly due to reaction between OH and organic precursors to make them more reactive with chlorine, and not due to RCS. The formation of specific DBPs of current or emerging regulatory interest was minimal under all conditions, except for chlorate. Chlorate yields were in the order of 6-18% of the photolysed chlorine.

AB The presence of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the environment is an emerging concern owing to their potential threat on aquatic ecosystems and living organisms. To investigate the bioremoval potential of a biological activated carbon (BAC) filter for the removal of NSAIDs, removal of diclofenac (DCF), ibuprofen (IBU), and naproxen (NAP) by biofilms on a bench-scaled BAC column operated for 400 days was studied. The results showed that the BAC column effectively removed the three NSAIDs (>90%). One bacterial strain isolated from the BAC, Pseudoxanthomonas sp. DIN-3, was able to simultaneously remove DCF, IBU, and NAP, which were supplied as the sole carbon source. In 14 days, 23%, 41%, and 39% of DCF, 1BU, and NAP (50 mu g L-1) were bioremoved, respectively, and strain DIN-3 eliminated IBU more rapidly than the other two NSAIDs. If only a single drug was added as the sole carbon source, ignoring the other drugs, the removal ability was overestimated by 5.0-27.0%. More efficient bioremoval was achieved, concomitantly with bacterial growth, via a co-metabolism with acetate, glucose, or methanol. Their intermediates were identified by UPLC-QQQ-MS, and their respective degradation pathways were also proposed. Moreover, based on the complete genome sequence of strain DIN-3, 49 related genes encoding the main enzymes involved in DCF, IBU, and NAP biodegradation were identified, including hemE, lpd, yihx, ligC, pobA, and ligA. These results suggested that Pseudoxanthomonas sp. DIN-3 is a potential degrader of DCF, IBU, and NAP, and to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that demonstrates the bioremoval of DCF, IBU, and NAP simultaneously by an individual bacterial strain isolated from the environment. However, the bioremoval potential should be evaluated when assessing the applicability of the strain in the environment because of the combined effects of various pharmaceutical contaminants. The obtained results provide a foundation for the use of Pseudoxanthomonas sp. DIN-3 in the bioremoval of polycyclic NSAID-contaminated environments. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The elimination of cyanobacteria is frequently required for treating and controlling the waters with harmful algal blooms. In this study, an improved flotation technology was developed using colloidal gas aphrons (CGAs) surface-modified with the inorganic coagulant of polyaluminum chloride (PACI); the Microcystis aeruginosa (M. aeruginosa) cells were efficiently removed and their re-growth was effectively inhibited. The so-created coagulative CGAs (CCGAs) exhibited the attractive characteristics of both CGAs and PACI for the cell removal. The experimental results clearly showed that 94.2-99.2% of cells were removed within 3 min at the optimum dosage of cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) and PACI at three different initial cell densities (OD680 = 0.05, 0.26 and 0.76); and the re-growth of M. aeruginosa did not occur in 10 days. The flocs derived from the CCGA-flotation were of smaller size and looser configuration in contrast with those obtained from coagulation-flotation. The CCGAs were robust in charge neutralization, cell capture, cell attack and destruction. Even at low CTAB dosages, those bubbles could provide large surface area for capturing the M. aeruginosa cells in both unicellular and colonial form compared with the unmodified CTAB-CGAs. The CCGAs reduced 59.5-87.9% of CTAB dosage with the assistance of PACI and the required flotation retention time was largely shortened in comparison with the sedimentation and flotation-based treatment options. This would lead to low treatment cost and sludge production. The present work provides a novel insight into the development of flotation technologies for treating and controlling dense harmful algal blooms. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Interactions between nano/microplastics and suspended sediment (SS) in natural waters are important for the environmental fate of plastic particles. This study investigated the effect of heteroaggregation between nano/microplastics and SS on the settling of aggregates. In NaCl solutions (0.05-0.5 M), large SS (100-500 mu m in diameter) significantly increased the settling ratio of polystyrene nanoplastics (PSNPs) with an average diameter of 100 nm due to the formation of PSNPs-SS aggregates. The settling ratio of the heteroaggregates increased significantly when the NaCl concentration increased from 50 to 200 mM. This was primarily because higher ionic strength reduced the electrostatic repulsion between large SS and PSNPs, and subsequently increased the heteroaggregation rate. No obvious differences in settling ratios were observed in 200 or 500 mM NaCl solutions because the heteroaggregation entered the diffusion-controlled regime. However, in HA solutions (10-50 mg L-1), the surface adsorption of HA on PSNPs and large SS reduced the heteroaggregation of PSNPs-SS and thus led to the low co-settling ratio due to the steric hindrance according to the DLVO theory. In contrast, polyethylene microplastics (PEMPs) with diameters of 1.0-1.2 mm were found to always float on water surface (up to 8 months), even after addition of 500 mg L-1 small SS (<10 mu m in diameter). Clearly, the heteroaggregation of PEMPs and small SS had minor effect on the settling of PEMPs due to the overwhelming boyanccy. These results provided new insight into the fate and distribution of nano/microplastics in aquatic environment, which affect the bioavailability of plastic particles in natural waters.

AB Electrodialysis (ED) is a promising emerging electrochemical membrane technology for nutrient concentration and recovery from wastewater. However associated environmental safety aspects have to be assessed before utilizing concentrated nutrient produced by ED, for instance as fertilizer. Municipal wastewaters contain various micropollutants that have the potential of being concentrated during the ED treatment processes. This study quantified the transport of pharmaceuticals during ED nutrient recovery from synthetic centrate wastewater. Specifically, it is evaluated whether pharmaceutical micropollutants are mobile, and therefore able to transport across the cation exchange membranes and concentrate into the ED concentrate product. Results demonstrate that NH4+-N, PO43--P and K+ could be concentrated up to 5 times in the concentrated ED product (3700-4000 mg/L NH4+-N, 21-25 mg/L PO43--P, 990-1040 mg/L K+). Target micropollutants, such as diclofenac, carbamazepine and furosemide were largely retained in the diluent, with less than 8% being transported across to the concentrate product (feed micropollutant concentration 10 or 100 mu g/L) based on the final target pharmaceutical amounts in the ED concentrate product (mu g). Some transport of micropollutants such as atenolol, metoprolol and hydrochlorothiazide was observed to the concentrate product. For instance a final concentration of 10.3, 9.4 and 8.6 mu g/L on average was measured for these pollutants in the final ED concentrate product (final volume similar to 1 L) in experiments with a feed water (initial volume 20 L) containing only 10 mu g/L of target pharmaceuticals. Transport of pharmaceuticals across the ED membranes was concluded to be dominated mainly by the molecule hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity as well as electrostatic interactions between pharmaceutical molecules and ED membranes. Particularly excluded were those having a negative charge and high hydrophobicity such as diclofenac and ibuprofen. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, we combined macroscopic measurements of precipitate aggregation and chemical composition (Mn/Fe solids ratio) with Fe and Mn K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy to investigate the solids formed by co-oxidation of Fe(II) and Mn(II) with O-2, MnO4, and HOCl in the presence of groundwater ions. In the absence of the strongly sorbing oxyanions, phosphate (P) and silicate (Si), and calcium (Ca), O-2 and HOCl produced suspensions that aggregated rapidly, whereas co-oxidation of Fe(II) and Mn(II) by MnO4 generated colloidally stable suspensions. The aggregation of all suspensions decreased in P and Si solutions, but Ca counteracted these oxyanion effects. The speciation of oxidized Fe and Mn in the absence of P and Si also depended on the oxidant, with O-2 producing Mn(III)-incorporated lepidocrocite (Mn/Fe = 0.01-0.02 mol/mol), HOCl producing Mn(III)-incorporated hydrous ferric oxide (HFO) (Mn/Fe = 0.08 mol/mol), and MnO4 producing poorly-ordered MnO2 and HFO (Mn/Fe > 0.5 mol/mol). In general, the presence of P and Si decreased the crystallinity of the Fe(III) phase and increased the Mn/Fe solids ratio, which was found by Mn K-edge XAS analysis to be due to an increase in surface-bound Mn(II). By contrast, Ca decreased the Mn/Fe solids ratio and decreased the fraction of Mn(II) associated with the solids, suggesting that Ca and Mn(II) compete for sorption sites. Based on these results, we discuss strategies to optimize the design (i.e. filter bed operation and chemical dosing) of water treatment plants that aim to remove Fe(II) and Mn(II) by co-oxidation.

AB Ethiprole and its degradation products were identified and quantified using UHPLC-Q-TOF/MS. Indoor culture experiments and UHPLC-Q-TOF/MS are used to study the hydrolysis, photolysis, and soil degradation behavior of ethiprole in water and soil. The differences in ethiprole degradation products across a range of environmental conditions such as pH, light, and oxygen availability were compared in order to improve understanding of the ethiprole degradation pathway and the toxicity of the degradation products. Eleven degradation products were identified using UHPLC-Q-TOF/MS and MetaboLynx XS Training software, and two new degradation products (M401 and M312) were characterized by H-1 NMR and HR MS. Three degradation products M401, M399, and M312 were detected in samples using a UHPLC-MS/MS protocol established in this study. Tests of acute toxicity of the three degradation products on Brachydanio rerio, Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, and Daphnia magna Straus found that the toxicity of M401 to Daphnia magna Straus was greater than that of the parent compound, indicating that ethiprole degradation should be carefully monitored in given the environmental risk posed by its degradation products.

AB Studies worldwide have demonstrated through in vitro bioassays and chemical analysis that endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) can accumulate in river sediments. However, remobilization of sediment-bound EDCs due to bioturbation or re-suspension during flood events remains poorly understood. The aim of this study was to evaluate the bioavailability of EDCs, more specifically estrogenic compounds (EC), from sediment under turbulent conditions using a passive sampling approach. Sediment was sampled along the Luppe River, Germany, previously described as a "hotspot" for ECs. The concentration of target ECs and estrogenic activity were investigated using chemical analysis (LC MS/MS) in addition to a novel screening tool (planar Yeast Estrogen Screen; p-YES) that utilizes high performance thin-layer chromatography plates in combination with an in vitro bioassay (YES). Estrone (50%, E1) and nonylphenol (35%, NP) accounted for the majority of estrogenic activity reported of up to 20 +/- 2.4 mu g E2 equivalents per kg dry weight in the Luppe sediments. Two types of passive samplers (polar organic chemical integrative sampler (POCIS) and Chemcatcher) were used to investigate the bioavailability of ECs from suspended sediment under laboratory conditions. NP, E1, E2 and ethynylestradiol (EE2) were remobilized from Luppe sediment when subjected to turbulent conditions, such as in a flood event, and were readily bioavailable at ecotoxicologically relevant concentrations (NP 18 mu g/L, E1 14 mu g/L, E2 0.2 mu g/ L, EE2 0.5 mu g/L).

AB Pesticides are emerging contaminants frequently detected in the aquatic environment. In this work, a novel approach combining activated carbon adsorption, oxygen plasma treatment and ozonation was studied for the removal of the persistent chlorinated pesticide alachlor. A comparison was made between the removal efficiency and energy consumption for two different reactor operation modes: batch-recirculation and single-pass mode. The kinetics study revealed that the insufficient removal of alachlor by adsorption was significantly improved in terms of degradation efficiency and energy consumption when combined with the plasma treatment. The best efficiency (ca. 80% removal with an energy cost of 19.4 kWh m(-3)) was found for the single-pass operational mode of the reactor. In the batch-recirculating process, a complete elimination of alachlor by plasma treatment was observed after 30 min of treatment. Analysis of the reactive species induced by plasma in aqueous solutions showed that the decomposition of alachlor mainly occurred through a radical oxidation mechanism, with a minor contribution of long-living oxidants (O-3, H2O2). Investigation of the alachlor oxidation pathways revealed six different oxidation mechanisms, including the loss of aromaticity which was never before reported for plasma-assisted degradation of aromatic pesticides. It was revealed that the removal rate and energy cost could be further improved with more than 50% by additional O-3 gas bubbling in the solution reservoir. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The role of rivers as a major transport pathway for all sizes of plastic debris into the ocean is widely recognized. Global modelling studies ranked the Changjiang River as the largest contributor of plastic waste to the marine environment, but these estimates were based on insufficient empirical data. To better understand the role of rivers in delivering terrestrial plastic debris to the ocean, the spatial and temporal patterns of microplastics (MP) in the Changjiang Estuary (CE) and the East China Sea (ECS) were studied based on surface water samples in February, May, and July 2017. A total of 3225 MP (60 -5000 mu m) were identified by Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometry. MP abundance in July was higher than in February and May due to higher river discharge. Density stratification in CE significantly influenced the surface MP abundances. A temporal accumulation zone within the river-sea interface for plastics was indicated by stations with apparently higher abundances in the river plume. Fibers were the most common MP (>80%) over three months. Small MP (<1000 mu m) composed 75.0% of the total plastics on average. The average mass of MP was 0.000033 g/particle, which was two orders of magnitude lower than the empirical mass in literature. Without considering tidal effects, we estimate 16-20 trillion MP particles, weighing 537.6-905.9 tons, entered the sea through the surface water layer of the Changjiang River in 2017. These findings of this study provide reliable information on MP waste in a large river, which should be considered in further studies for estimating the riverine plastic loads. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The raw fresh leachate from municipal solid waste (MSW) incineration plants contains high concentrations of volatile fatty acids (VFAs), ammonia and metals, all compounds that severely limit anaerobic digestion treatment efficiencies. These inhibitory compounds make reactor systems unstable, causing reactor start-up periods to take more than 100 days, even when the leachate is diluted significantly. In this study, granular activated carbon (GAC) was incorporated into a bioreactor fed with raw incineration leachate. Addition of GAC allowed direct treatment of raw incineration leachate without any start-up acclimation period, while the non-amended control reactor soured immediately and collapsed within 17 days. When hydraulic retention time (HRT) of the GAC-amended reactor was stepwise decreased to increase organic loading rates (OLR) to 25.0 kgCOD/(m(3).d), COD removal efficiencies remained stable at >90%. Metagenomic analysis of the GAC-amended reactor revealed that Geobacter and Methanosarcina, species known to participate in direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET), were more abundant in the GAC-amended reactor than the seed sludge. In addition, the abundance of genes coding for proteins thought to be involved in DIET such as electrically conductive pili and the outer membrane c-type cytochrome, OmcS, increased significantly, while genes involved in fermentation, and nitrate (narG) and sulfate (dsrA) reduction dropped significantly as the experiment progressed. These results are significant because this is the first detailed investigation into the metabolic capabilities of microbial communities involved in efficient treatment of raw incineration leachate within biomethanogenic reactors that did not require a long start-up period.

AB Previous analysis of the Dutch National Legionella Outbreak Detection Program 2002-2012 has shown that buildings required to maintain a Legionella control plan for their drinking water installation are more likely to test positive for Legionella spp. Than buildings without such a plan (38% versus 22% of samples). To clarify this discrepancy, we analysed the results of mandatory water sample testing conducted as part of risk assessments in 206 buildings in the Netherlands from 2011 to 2015. Of the 6171 samples analysed, 16.2% exceeded the Dutch drinking water standard for Legionella spp. of 100 CFU/litre. In buildings with <= 50 tap points, the average percentage of samples containing >= 100 CFU/litre was 28.2%, and from buildings with >50 tap points, it was 12.2%. Analysis of serial samples (taken every 6 months) from each building showed that 33.2% of all buildings tested positive for at least one sample every 6 months. The overall increase was 4.4% per year. Analysis of Legionella subgroups showed that while the majority of positive samples contained L non-pneumophila (96.9%), some samples did contain L pneumophila serogroup 1 (1.0%) and serogroups 2-14 (2.1%). Our data suggest that the Dutch mandatory risk assessment and drinking water management plan is not sufficiently effective in preventing the proliferation of Legionella spp. and may even contribute to proliferation. This analysis should now be expanded to include other areas of the Netherlands in order to understand the geographical differences that we observed in our results, and why smaller buildings appear to be more likely to test positive for Legionella spp. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The incomplete denitrification due to insufficient carbon resource in the wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) resulted in low nitrogen removal efficiency, which has become a widespread problem in China and all around the world. Reducing the requirement of carbon source by manipulating the nitrogen removal pathway from conventional nitrification-denitrification to partial nitrification-denitrification is considered as an efficient solution. In this article, the feasibility of combining free nitrous acid (FNA) sludge treatment and DO control to achieve partial nitrification-denitrification in a continuous flow system (aerobic-anoxic-oxic process) using real sewage was assessed. The nitrite pathway was rapidly established in the experimental reactor within 23 days by simultaneously lowering DO concentration in aerobic zone to 0.5 mg/L and treating 30% of the activated sludge per day from the reactor in the FNA sludge treatment unit with FNA concentration of 1.2 mg N/L and exposure time of 18 h. The nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB) were efficiently washed out and the partial nitrification process could maintain stable in the experimental reactor even after cease of FNA treatment and increase of DO concentrations in the main stream to 1.5 mg/L, with an average nitrite accumulation rate of above 78%. In contrast, the nitrite accumulation rate was just around 58% during low DO concentrations phase and declined quickly to below 1% after the DO concentrations were increased to 1.5 mg/L in the control reactor which only utilized single strategy of DO control to achieve nitrite pathway. Moreover, a better sludge settleability and nitrogen removal performance could also be realized in the experimental reactor. The results of nitrifying bacteria activities and quantities detection demonstrated that although NOB activities in both reactors were effectively inhibited, a certain amount of NOB (6.26 x 10(6) copies/g MLSS) were remained in the control reactor and multiplied rapidly as the DO concentration increased, which might break down the partial nitrification. Furthermore, the quantity results of nitrogen cycling related functional genes showed that the increment of the ratio of nitrate reduced bacteria to total bacteria was 0.35% larger than that of nitric oxide bacteria in the control reactor, while those two ratios increased similarly by 1.11% and 1.12% in the experimental reactor, respectively, which might be one potential cause of reduction in N2O emission of nitrite pathway achieved by FNA-based technologies.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the negative impact of a newly-formed manganese (Mn)-layer on calcite dissolution in the long-term operation of a calcite contactor. Simultaneous removal of Mn and remineralization of soft water in an up-flow calcite contactor was conducted and led to a progressive loading of Mn into the calcite matrix. The calcite contactor demonstrated high Mn removal; however, the hardness release decreased from 32 to 20 mg CaCO3 L-1 after 600 h of operation on a high Mn concentration (5 mg L-1) feed. For an elevated Mn concentration (i.e. 5 mg Mn L-1) in the feed water, the coated layer was mainly composed of Mn which inhibits the mass transfer from the calcite core to the liquid phase. The superficial layer was identified as 5.2% Mn oxides (MnOx) by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Therefore, it is postulated that Mn removal starts with an ion exchange sorption reaction between soluble Mn2+ from aqueous phase and Ca2+ from the CaCO3 matrix which is followed by a slow recrystallization of MnCO3 into MnO2. On the other hand, when the Mn content in the feed water was lower (i.e. 0.5 mg Mn L-1), a considerably lower amount of MnOx was detected on the coated media. For all the examined conditions, the formation of this coating improved Mn removal due to the autocatalytic nature of the adsorption/oxidation of dissolved manganese by MnOx. A mechanistic model based on calcite dissolution and the progressive formation of a MnO2 layer was implemented in PHREEQC software to predict the reduction in hardness release expected in long-term operation. The model was calibrated with experimental data and resulted in realistic breakthrough curves. In order to accurately predict the pH of the effluent stream, a slow-rate recrystallization of MnCO3 into MnO2 was implemented (compared to the fast precipitation of MnO2 or the absence of MnO2 formation).

AB Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) including extracellular ARGs (eARGs) and intracellular ARGs (iARGs), are recognized as emerging environmental contaminants. Despite extensive efforts to profile ARGs in their "hotspots" wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), the contribution of eARGs to antibiotic resistance spread remains unclear. Here, we applied metagenomic sequencing to investigate the distribution, mobility and microbial hosts of eARGs in activated sludge from five WWTPs. The total relative abundance eARGs ranged from 9.5 x 10(-6) to 1.3 x 10(-4), mainly encompassing elfamycin, dual drug, and aminoglycoside resistance genes. Multiple eARGs (e.g., EF-Tu, ropB, and rpsL mutants) were shared among the five WWTPs, and some clustered in the same genetic element (e.g., EF-Tu-rpsJ). eARGs were found to frequently co-localize with the eMGEs (e.g., sul1 -3'CS-TnAs3, sul2-intI1-ISVsa3, and tetX-p63039), which may facilitate the mobilization of eARGs. Most eARGs likely originated from the genera Mycobacterium (6.7%), Nitrosomonas (5.3%), Steroidobacter (5.3%), Nitrospira (5.2%) and Pseudomonas (5.1%). No significant difference in the diversity, abundance, and mobility was observed between eARGs and iARGs. The host composition of eARGs and iARGs from municipal WWTPs are consistently dominated by Nitrosomonas, Steroidobacter, Nitrospira and Pseudomonas, while some differentially enriched genera (especially Nitrospira) in the hosts of iARGs compared with those of eARGs from the swine WWTP were identified. Our findings corroborate the mobile eARGs reservoir in WWTPs, thereby laying foundation for mitigating widespread antibiotic resistance. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The presence of nano and microplastics in water has increasingly become a major environmental challenge. A key challenge in their detection resides in the relatively inadequate analytical techniques available preventing deep understanding of the fate of nano/microplastics in water. The occurrence of nano/microplastics in water and wastewater treatment plants poses a concern for the quality of the treated water. Due to their broad but small size and diverse chemical natures, nano/microplastics may travel easily along water and wastewater treatment processes infiltrating remediation processes at various levels, representing operational and process stability challenges. This review aims at presenting the current understanding of the fate and impact of nano/microplastics through water and wastewater treatment plants. The formation and fragmentation mechanisms, physical-chemical properties and occurrence of nano/microplastics in water are correlated to the interactions of nano/microplastics with water and wastewater treatment plant processes and potential solutions to limit these interactions are comprehensively reviewed. This critical analysis offers new strategies to limit the number of nano/microplastics in water and wastewater to keep water quality up to the required standards and reduce threats on our ecosystems.

AB Sensor maintenance is time-consuming and is a bottleneck for monitoring on-site wastewater treatment systems. Hence, we compare maintained and unmaintained sensors to monitor the biological performance of a small-scale sequencing batch reactor (SBR). The sensor types are ion-selective pH, optical dissolved oxygen (DO), and oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) with platinum electrode. We created soft sensors using engineered features: ammonium valley for pH, oxidation ramp for DO, and nitrite ramp for the ORP. Four soft sensors based on unmaintained pH sensors correctly identified the completion of the ammonium oxidation (89-91 out of 107 cycles), about as many times as soft sensors based on a maintained pH sensor (91 out of 107 cycles). In contrast, the DO soft sensor using data from a maintained sensor showed slightly better (89 out of 96 cycles) detection performance than that using data from two unmaintained sensors (77, respectively 82 out of 96 correct). Furthermore, the DO soft sensor using maintained data is much less sensitive to the optimisation of cut-off frequency and slope tolerance than the soft sensor using unmaintained data. The nitrite ramp provided no useful information on the state of nitrite oxidation, so no comparison of maintained and unmaintained ORP sensors was possible in this case. We identified two hurdles when designing soft sensors for unmaintained sensors: i) Sensors' type-and design-specific deterioration affects performance. ii) Feature engineering for soft sensors is sensor type specific, and the outcome is strongly influenced by operational parameters such as the aeration rate. In summary, the results with the provided soft sensors show that frequent sensor maintenance is not necessarily needed to monitor the performance of SBRs. Without sensor maintenance monitoring small-scale SBRs becomes practicable, which could improve the reliability of unstaffed on-site treatment systems substantially. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Solid-state amorphization during mechanical alloying of Fe-xTi alloys (x = 33.3 and 50 at.%) and the subsequent mechanically-induced crystallization by continued ball milling was studied. In the case of Fe-50Ti, it was revealed that by milling of Fe and Ti powders, firstly the nanocrystalline FeTi intermetallic compound forms, and then, the amorphous phase appears. In the case of Fe-33.3Ti, the amorphous phase formed directly and at lower energies. Continued milling of the Fe-33.3Ti system resulted in the devitrification of the powder with the appearance of the diffraction peaks of nanocrystalline alpha-Fe. For unambiguous analysis of the amorphization, the quantitative XRD amorphization parameter was taken into account. Examination of the milled powders revealed that, despite the dominance of fracturing compared to cold welding, the size of powder particles refines tremendously due to the amorphization and the brittleness it brings in the system. Conclusively, this works revealed some of the unknown aspects of amorphization in this system.

AB Transparent glass-ceramics in the ZnO-Al2O3-SiO2 (ZAS) system have great importance as optical glass-ceramics. Gahnite (ZnAl2O4) nanocrystals were used as a host for the various dopants which with increasing their amount, improving the performance of the product. In this research, without using the conventional nucleating agents, a transparent nano glass-ceramic including Gahnite nanocrystals was made. Precise temperature and time selection of nucleation and crystallization heat treatment were performed using XRD (X-ray diffraction), FESEM (Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy), Dilatometry, and differential thermal analysis (DTA). The average size of Gahnite nanocrystals was about 50 nm. The transparency of the nano glass-ceramic in the visible range was more than 60%.

AB The melt quench technique was involved in synthesizing the glass system LiF-SrO-B2O3 alloyed with Cr2O3 in the range of 0 to 0.25 mol%. The aperoidic nature of these glasses was affirmed by the X-ray diffraction (XRD). These glasses were analyzed by contemplating the dielectric characteristics (a.c. conductivity, sigma(ac), dielectric constant, epsilon', and dielectric loss, tan delta etc.,), spectroscopic properties such as electron spin resonance (ESR) optical absorption and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis. The optical absorption spectra evinced two bands which are features of Cr3+ ions in the octahedral domain. Using absorption edges, Urbach energies and optical band gap of these samples were estimated. The hike in the Cr3+ ions in the glass C5 (0.05 mol% of Cr2O3) is confirmed by the proliferation in the ESR signal intensity and optical absorption peak. The maximum a.c. conductivity of glass C5 was due to the dominant presence of Cr3+ ions. FTIR bands revealed that at 0.05 mol% of Cr2O3, BO4 units were converted into BO3 units. It is perceived that the semiconducting nature of glass C5 was the highest among all the prepared glasses.

AB Effects of hydrogen on the mechanical property and microstructure evolution are investigated on a Zr-based metallic glass composite contains both metallic glass matrix and body centered cubic (bcc) dendrite crystal. The compressive strength to failure descreased from 2.2 GPa to 1.9 GPa; the fracture strain decreased from 39% to 26%. The composite retains a moderate compressive strength and strain after hydrogenation. The composite shows certain resistance of hydrogen embrittlement. Neither nanocrystallization in amorphous matrix nor amorphization in bcc dendrite crystal is detected. But there are so many stacking faults in the bcc dendrite crystal after hydrogen charging. Hydrogen lowers the value of stacking fault energy and promotes planar slip of the dendrite crystal. Planar slip and slip localization accelerate the deformation of the dendrite crystal and lead to premature fracture of the composite. The experimental results are consistent with the hydrogen enhanced local plasticity mechanism of hydrogen embrittlement.

AB Toxic element-free and low-cost Zr-based bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) with a property combination of high glass forming ability, large room-temperature plasticity and good biocompatibility are vital candidates as biomedical devices materials. In the present work, the critical diameter (d(max)), thermal glass stability, room-temperature mechanical properties, cytotoxicity, corrosion and wear resistances of a series of Zr63.5-xHfxAl9Fe4.5Cu23 (x = 0.0, 1.5, 3.0, 4.5, 6.0, at.%) alloys have been investigated. The Zr60.5Hf3Al9Fe4.5Cu23 (x = 3.0) BMG alloy is found to combine a centimeter scale d(max) with large room-temperature plasticity (epsilon(P) = 4.0%). The electrochemical and immersion tests showed the BMG exhibits good corrosion resistance in phosphate buffered solution (PBS) open to air at 37 degrees C. The passive current density is 9.2 x 10(-9) A/cm(2), which is one order of magnitude lower than Ti6Al4V alloy at same condition. In addition, the cytotoxicity tests reveal higher cell viability with CCD-986sk cells on the BMG substrate than on Ti6Al4V alloy, showing that the BMG had good biocompatibility. Cell morphologies on the BMG and Ti6Al4V substrates exhibit better cell adhesion of the BMG in comparison with that of Ti6Al4V alloy. Furthermore, the dry wear test shows the wear mass loss is < 1/4 of Ti6Al4V alloy at same condition. The attainment of the combination of lower cost and excellent properties suggests that the Zr60.5Hf3Al9Fe4.5Cu23 BMG can be a promising biomedical device material.

AB All known oxide glasses are inherently brittle, but their resistance to damage such as hardness and crack resistance varies strongly as a function of the chemical composition. The damage resistance is in turn related to the underlying deformation mechanism, which is at least partly related to the Poisson's ratio. That is, glasses with high Poisson's ratio tend to mostly deform through shear flow relative to densification, which leads to ductility in metallic glasses for Poisson's ratio above similar to 0.33. In this study, we investigate the structure and mechanical properties of a binary zinc borate glass with a relatively high Poisson's ratio (0.30), which we modify by partial substitution of ZnO with La2O3. Glass transition temperature, density, Vickers hardness and crack resistance, as well as elastic constants are studied, in addition to the short and intermediate range structure as probed by B-11 solid-state NMR and Raman spectroscopy. We find that the substitution of La for Zn leads to a monotonic increase in Poisson's ratio and elastic moduli, while local maxima are recorded in the trends of glass transition temperature, hardness, and crack resistance. Correlations between the mechanical and structural properties are discussed to shed light onto the structural origin of damage resistance in oxide glasses with high Poisson's ratio.

AB Iron phosphate glass of composition 40 mol% Fe2O3-60 mol% P2O5 is generally prepared by melt quench technique using a mixture of Fe2O3 and NH4H2PO4 at 1423 K (labelled as IPG-A). Though the starting material contains only Fe3+ ions, the resultant glass is found to contain different concentrations of Fe2+ ions depending on the conditions of preparation. Hence an attempt was made to synthesize iron phosphate glass (labelled as IPG-D) from Fe3+ containing crystalline compound, Fe-4(P2O7)(3) (synthesized through solution route) whose composition is the same as that of IPG-A. IPG-D could be quenched at 1323 K, which is 100 K less than the normal pouring temperature of IPG-A. Synthesized IPG-D was investigated for its phase purity and structure by XRD, Mossbauer and Raman spectroscopy. No phase separation was observed during the investigation. Importantly we report the formation of IPG-D with almost all Fe ions in 3+ valence state for the first time. The advantage of using a crystalline compound for the formation of iron phosphate glass is presented.

AB We propose a procedure for the determination of the parameters of the Curie temperature distribution (TCD) in a compositionally inhomogeneous ferromagnetic material. Assuming a Gaussian TCD and using a mean field approach based on the Brillouin function, we report that with respect to the average value of the distribution: a) both inflection point of magnetization, T-inf, and temperature at maximum magnetic entropy change curves, T-pk(MCE), shift to lower temperatures and b) temperature at maximum paramagnetic susceptibility, T-pk(chi), shifts to higher temperatures. Using these evolutions as a function of the TCD broadening and fitting them to a second order polynomial function, a self-consistent procedure to determine the parameters of the distribution is supplied. These predictions have been experimentally tested for a ball milled Fe70Zr30 amorphous alloy using thermomagnetic and magnetocaloric measurements. The obtained parameters using the proposed procedure agree with those directly measured using Mossbauer spectrometry.

AB Er3+ incorporated Bismuth bariumtelluroborate [BTBxEr] glasses were synthesized using the composition, 20TeO(2) + (30-x)B2O3 + 30BaO + 20Bi(2)O(3) + xEr(2)O(3), following the traditional melt quenching method. The bonding parameters were calculated using absorption spectra to analyze the dopant-host bonding nature. Omega(lambda) (lambda = 2,4,6) intensity parameters are determined from the oscillator strengths employing Judd-Ofelt (JO) theory for the estimation of the radiative parameters. Broad emission transition I-4(13/2) -> I-4(15/2) were observed around 1530 nm, under 980 nm excitation which exhibits outstanding increased intensity with the Er3+ concentration of till it reaches 0.5 wt%. CIE chromaticity coordinates, CCT and Duv have determined to analyze the color of emission and the absorption quality of the glasses. Lifetime for the I-4(13/2) excited (at 980 nm excitation) and S-4(3/2) (at 488 nm excitation) levels of Er3+ ions were measured using decay measurements. Of all investigations, BTBEr glasses could be an apt material for the fabrication optical amplifiers, display devices and green laser applications.

AB In a recent article I have concluded that phantom nuclei are irrelevant for an isothermal crystallization process that consists of nucleation and spherical growth, and for the type of growth rates considered in my study. I illustrated phantom irrelevance by comparing two solutions of the crystallization formulation I introduced: the first one is a constant nucleation rate model, which can be represented by the Avrami equation and does not excludes phantoms; the second is a solution with a varying nucleation rate that is proportional to the fraction of untransformed material. I maintain that this latter case excludes phantoms. In a Comment on my article by Tomellini and Fanfoni it is claimed that my comparison is invalid. Their main argument is that a varying nucleation rate solution does not exclude phantoms. To refute this claim, I present arguments supporting my assertion that a phantom-excluding model can be obtained by introducing a nucleation rate proportional to the fraction of untransformed phase.

AB A series of SiO2-La2O2CO3 and SiO2-La2O3 mixed oxide/carbonate systems with La/Si molar ratios of 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 have been obtained by the sol gel technique from tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) and metallic lanthanum powder. For the low lanthanum loading systems (La/Si 0.05 to 0.25) the lanthanum carboxy phase is easily transformed to oxide phase during thermal treatment in the presence of silica. The most important advantage of the proposed method is the possibility of obtaining a mixed oxide/carbonate phase and not directly an oxide phase as in the case of other methods. Depending on the calcination temperature and time, the proposed method can be used for obtaining compositions containing dioxycarbonate, oxide or mixed lanthanum phase.
   The systems were characterized by X-ray diffraction, low temperature nitrogen adsorption, transmission and scanning electron microscopy (TEM, SEM and SEM/EDS), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and FT-IR spectra.

AB Novel transparent oxyfluoride nano-glass-ceramics containing undoped and 0.5 Eu3+ (mol%) doped NaGdF4 nanocrystals (NCs), were obtained by sol-gel for the first time. X-ray diffraction (XRD) confirms the precipitation of alpha- and beta-NaGdF4 NCs with a size ranging between 5 and 24 nm. When the Na:Gd ratio, temperature and heating time are fixed to 0.95:1, 550-600 degrees C and 1-8 h, respectively, only the beta-NaGdF4 phase precipitates. These results are confirmed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The decomposition of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and the formation of fluoride lattice bonds were studied by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Thus, the sol-gel route permits NaGdF4 glass-ceramics to be obtained through the control of Na:Gd ratio, temperature and heating time. The incorporation of dopant ions in the NaGdF4 NCs was confirmed by photoluminescence measurements which show narrow and well-resolved Eu3+ emission and excitation spectra in GCs. Moreover, the low asymmetry ratio values between the electric dipole (D-5(0) -> F-7(2)) to the magnetic dipole (D-5(0) -> F-7(1)) transitions indicate that Eu3+ ions are incorporated in the NaGdF4 NCs. Furthermore, efficient Gd3+ -> Eu3+ energy transfer results in an enhancement of the reddish Eu3+ emissions, further supported by fluorescence decay lifetimes.

ID LASING PERFORMANCE; FIBER; RAMAN
AB The structure evolution and relationship between structure and properties of Yb3+-doped phosphate glasses with adding GeO2 from 0 to 450 wt% (marked as PG) were analyzed using Tg, Yb3+ local environment parameters, XRD, infrared and Raman spectra. The formation of Ge-O-P was valuable for improving spectroscopic properties at low germanium oxide (GeO2 < 20 wt%). However, the broadening of XRD scattering package and the reduction of Tg indicated that two networks of P-O and Ge-O emerged in the case of high germanium oxide (20 wt % < GeO2 < 100 wt%). Furthermore, under ultra-high germanium oxide (GeO2 > 100 wt%), some significant macroscopic phase separation phenomena were observed by XRD, absorption spectra, double fluorescence lifetime, SEM and EPMA measurements. A component-property evaluation criterion for optimizing Stark splitting and spectroscopic properties was suggested by comprehensive evaluation of the glass stability, Stark splitting, spectral properties and phase separation of Yb3+-doped PG glass system, i.e., the appropriate proportions of O/(P + Ge) and P/Ge were 2.87-2.96 and 4.36-8.71, respectively.

DT Article
DE Elastocaloric effect; Magnetic materials; Shape memory materials
AB Room temperature elastocaloric effect as well as the effects of strain rate and loading stress have been studied in polycrystalline Ni51Mn34In8Sn7. The increase of strain rate reduces plastic deformation and lattice invariant strain, thus improving the superelasticity. Higher strain rate and stress facilitate the stress-induced structural transition and adiabatic environment, and so the temperature change (Delta T) increases at a rate of 1.77 K (1% s (1))(-1) and 1.78 K (10(2) MPa)(-1). A large Delta T of 4.2 K is obtained by optimizing the strain rate and loading stress, which is comparable to or even larger than those of many NiMn-based alloys at room temperature. This result suggests polycrystalline Ni51Mn34In8Sn7 as a desirable material for room temperature elastocaloric refrigeration. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Textile with Janus wetting properties, viz., one side super-nonwetting (abridged as SNW) and the other side super-wetting (SW), was fabricated via copper (Cu) deposition and subsequent chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of 1-dodecanethiol (DT). To facilitate or hinder the deposition of DT molecules onto the SNW or SW side, three measures were taken. Firstly, less Cu particles were electroless deposited onto the adhered side of the textile to the vessel bottom. Secondly, the side with less Cu particles were adhered to the bottom of the vessel in the CVD process and was wetted by water. Thirdly, the DT molecules on the cap of the vessel spread downward and deposited on the exposed side and could not go through the textile and deposit on the bottom side due to the water sealing and evaporating.

ID SIMULATION; EVOLUTION
AB Directed energy deposition (DED) is often utilized to coat metallic part with complex geometries in a variety of anti-corrosion materials or high-temperature materials. Computer-controlled scanning patterns always affect the grain morphology in coating, which can further influence coating's mechanical properties. In this study, a Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) Potts model is applied to predict the grain morphology under two different frequently-used laser scanning patterns: unidirectional and bidirectional raster patterns. Then the predicted grain morphologies in coatings with these two scanning patters were quantified and analyzed respectively. The simulated results were verified with an electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) image of SS304 DED part reported by a literature. It was found that the primary grain morphology in coating was columnar shape. Some fine equiaxed grains appeared near the center line of scanning path. However, the columnar grains had crescentic shapes under unidirectional pattern, which was different from the linear shape of columnar grains under bidirectional pattern. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB To improve the toughness of polyamide 6, ABS/PA6 blends were prepared by reactive extrusion via anionic ring opening polymerization of epsilon-caprolactam. The morphology and mechanical properties showed that ABS played a critical role in the compatibility, morphology, and toughness of reactive blends. Submicron-sized ABS was evenly dispersed in PA6 by in situ compatibilizing and strong shearing of double screws. By optimizing ABS contents, super toughened PA6 can be obtained, as evidenced by the significant improvement in the impact strength. This indicated the in situ reactive extrusion method should be useful for production of ABS/PA6 blends. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB An electrospinning technique was first developed to fabricate CuWO4 nanofibrous mat as photocatalyst. After calcination at 550 degrees C to completely remove PAN polymer, the average diameter of anorthic CuWO4 nanofibers was 250 nm. Due to the existence of mesoscale and macroscale pores, the surface area of CuWO4 nanofibers was up to 17.96 m(2) g (1). In addition to the favorable recycling performance, CuWO4 nanofibers exhibited higher visible light photocatalytic activity than that of CuWO4 nanoparticles prepared by hydrothermal method. Such an advantageous electrospinning route brings effective improvement in the photocatalytic activity and affords a solution to the separation problem from wastewater purification for photocatalyst.

AB One of most difficult technical barriers for developing solid-state supercapacitors is low ionic conductivity of the polymer electrolyte at low temperature below the freezing point and at room temperature. In this work, a method which incorporates the addition of a small quantity of K4Fe(CN)(6)/K3Fe(CN)(6) mediators in the PVDF-LiTFS polymer electrolyte membrane was used to achieve high conductivity at -20 degrees C and 20 degrees C. When the concentration of the mediators was below 4 vol%, the ionic conductivity of the membrane was in the level of 10(-3)S/cm at -20 degrees C and 10(-2)S/cm at 20 degrees C and the electronic conductivity was less than 2 x 10(-6)S/cm at -20 degrees C and at 20 degrees C, suggesting that the polymer electrolyte can be used as a separator in a solid-state supercapacitor. The performance of the solid-state supercapacitor with mediator-containing membrane separator was better than that with mediator-free membrane separator at -20 degrees C. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Magnesium (Mg) and its alloys are considered as promising implant materials due to their biodegradability. However, high degradation rate cannot well match tissue repair process and may result in severe cytotoxicity. In addition, post-surgery infection may also raise safety concerns. In the present work, solid diffusion zinc was adopted to construct a barrier coating on the surface of AZ31B Mg alloy. The results show the coating is composed of MgZn and Mg2Zn11 intermetallics, which possesses good corrosion resistance, antibacterial ability, and cytocompatibility. The alloy after 8 h of the treatment shows the highest comprehensive performance thus is promising as biomedical coating of Mg alloy. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Urchin like Al2O3:Eu3+ hollow microsphere precursors have been synthesized via a rapid sol-gel synthetic route followed by a solvent-induced self-transformation process. The preparation of Al2O3:Eu3+ hollow microsphere phosphors involves the following steps: firstly epoxide-driven sol-gel reactions induce gel formation. Secondly, the gel transforms into urchin-like hollow microspheres precursor through a solvent-induced self-transformation process. Finally, Al2O3:Eu3+ hollow microsphere phosphors are obtained after a low temperature calcination procedure. Al2O3:Eu3+ hollow microsphere phosphors with diameter around 1-2 mu m present an urchin-like external surface constructed by randomly aggregated and interconnecting nanoplatelets. The photoluminescence spectra indicate that the Al2O3:Eu3+ hollow microsphere phosphors exhibit strong red emission under UV excitation. Upon excitation at 395 nm, emission peaks at 579 nm, 592 nm, 615 nm, 650 nm and 700 nm could be clearly observed due to the transitions from the D-5(0) -> F-7(J) (J = 0, 1, 2, 3,4).

AB ZnO nano and microstructures were obtained by solvothermal synthesis using hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA) as alkaline agent, and water, water/methanol and methanol as solvents. Two types of samples were obtained: a ZnO powder that grew at the bulk solution and ZnO on silicon substrates. The effect of the solvent on the morphology and optical emission was studied, as well as the influence of the growth zone. With increasing methanol content, the morphology changed from nanorods to nanoparticles powders, and from oriented arrangement of nanorods to thin film on silicon substrates. Important changes in photoluminescence induced by the methanol content and depending on the growth zone were also observed. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The photogeneration of singlet oxygen (O-1(2) ) during short irradiation times of graphene oxide (GO) is assessed under visible light with soft irradiation conditions either directly monitoring the phosphorescence emission of O-1(2) at ca. 1275 nm, or indirectly by means of the fluorescent probe 9, 10-anthracene diyl-bis(methylene)dimalonic acid (ABDA). Results obtained using both methodologies lead to the conclusion that O-1(2) generation is negligible under our experimental conditions. In the case of using ABDA very small emission changes were recorded, which could be attributed to other side reactions. Special care should be taken when using this spectroscopic probe to assess the generation of O-1(2), since ABDA and related probes based on the reactivity of the anthracene fluorophore can also detect electron transfer processes. This kind of approaches have been less explored in the field of Materials Science at the nanoscale, and we believe that the knowledge on the lack of generation of O-1(2) by irradiated GO is informative and useful, especially for the assessment of the environmental and biological toxicity of nanomaterials based on GO.

To investigate the feasibility for the housing of audio device, we have also manufactured an assembled loudspeaker with the ABS/PLA biomass alloy by injection molding technique and then actuated it with resembling frequency response to the wooden loudspeaker. Experimental results manifest that lab-made ABS/PLA biomass alloy with qualified density, excellent mechanical characteristics, and good processibility is a highly potential biomass composite for the housing of acoustic apparatus.

AB Nitrogen-doped pyrolytic carbon coated Fe3O4 nanocrystals supported by large sheet-size graphene (N-pC/Fe3O4/G) were synthesized by a self-assembly process followed by heating to obtain a high-performance anode material. The 3D porous poly-melamine sponge (PMS) acted as a template for the assembly of graphene to form curved and hollow foam structure, and as a source of N-doped carbon coating of Fe3O4 nanocrystals. The N-pC/Fe3O4/G composite exhibits good reversible capacity of 825 mAh/g after 350 cycles at a high current density of 1 A/g, showing much better performance than either one of its two components. Its performance benefits from the long-range conductivity of the graphene foam and the short-range local conductivity of the N-doped carbon coating. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Morphological and structural observations demonstrate that such microflower is assembled by a large amount of nanosheets, and the nanosheets is comprised of numerous nanowires which are randomly interwoven to each other. In comparison to the pure sample, the Ce-doped NiO microflowers exhibit superior ethanol sensing properties. The higher sensor response is primarily responsible for the unique hierarchical nanostructure and the change in effective hole concentration due to the incorporation of Ce into NiO.

AB The fabrication of submicro/nano porous thermosetting resin with defined cell size and distribution remains a challenge. Diazirine was induced into the epoxy resin matrix as the on-demand UV initiated chemical foaming agent (CFA) under room temperature. Cell dimension became tunable ranging from around 1 mm to tens nm by varying the matrix curing extent when the UV took effect. Curing extent of the matrix was monitored by measuring the rheological properties in the real time. UV foaming showed the potential to be used for the control of cell morphology in porous thermosetting materials. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this contribution, a totally different tempered microstructural sequence induced by electro-pulsing is observed in 42CrMo steel. Compared with the granular carbides in tempered TQ (traditional quenched) sample, ultrafine lamellar pearlites are found in tempered EPQ (electro-pulsing treated, followed with water-cooling) sample. The formation of this special tempered microstructure is related with the stacking faults in EPQ sample. Moreover, the grains and microstructure of 42CrMo steel are also refined via electro-pulsing. Results of mechanical properties indicate that tempered 42CrMo steel with ultrafine lamellar pearlites possesses higher strength, ductility and hardness. This interesting finding paves the way for developing 42CrMo steel with higher properties more efficiently. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Nanodiamonds (ND) are one of the most attractive carbon materials for nanotechnology. The impregnation of NDs into the polymer capsule shell in the form of the single nanoparticles insures the control over the thermal conductivity of the capsule shell and increases their sensitivity to the external microwave irradiation. The polymer shell of the polyelectrolyte capsules was modified with NDs by electrostatic adsorption technique. The sensitivity of the capsules with embedded NDs to the external microwave irradiation was demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy leading to the shell rupture and release of the encapsulated agents.

AB Tuning optical properties for narrow band gap semiconductors is attractive and meaningful for infrared optical and optoelectronic devices. Here, we demonstrate the impacts of O+ beam on morphological, structural and optical properties of polycrystalline PbSe thin films using an L-9 (3(3)) orthogonal experimental design. Three types of specific surface microstructures were induced by ion beam. Morphological evolutions were revealed to be manipulated by beam configurations. Tunable optical band gap and enhanced absorbance were also induced by ion beam modifications. The structural properties and the Urbach energy as low as similar to 2 meV both suggest a well-ordered microstructure of this material with high crystallinity. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Silica nanotubes with controllable size were synthesized as the electrospun silk fibroin/gelatin composite nanofibers as novel sacrificial template were firstly coated with silica in the Stober-type sol-gel precursor and then burned out at 600 degrees C. The aqueous stability of composite nanofibers was much better than that of gelatin nanofibers due to the presence of silk fibroin. FT-IR spectrum showed that silica nanotubes had the strong adsorption band at 1115 cm(-1) for Si-O-Si groups. TEM observation showed that the diameter of silica nanotubes could be controlled from 225 +/- 11 nm to 470 +/- 9 nm by tuning the silk fibroin/gelatin weight ratio from 1.25 to 2. After incubation with the osteoblast MG63 cells, silica nanotubes (0-200 mu g/ mL) had no significant cytotoxicity and presented excellent biocompatibility. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

ID DEGRADATION; EVOLUTION; PBI2
AB X-ray Photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of methyl ammonium lead halide perovskite films typically show the presence of lead as Pb(II), but Pb(0) is also often observed, potentially influencing the interpretation of the device physics. In this article the reproducible evolution of Pb(0) peaks which are likely artefacts generated under typical XPS analytical conditions are demonstrated from methyl ammonium lead halide films that contain no Pb(0) initially. The evolution of Pb(0) occurs via (1) X-ray photolysis under typical analytical conditions and (2) alongside other chemical changes as a result of film aging in air. In both cases we note the presence of PbI2 as a common factor contributing to in situ reactions to generate Pb(0) artefacts. Hence the observation of Pb(0) should be treated with extreme caution and here we recommend simple precautions to ensure materials analysis of these films gives reliable information when analyzed under UHV conditions.

AB In this paper, we report a novel and facile structure of graphene aerogel dispersed with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) loaded with zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-8). ZIF-8 was well intertwined by CNTs and this interconnecting composite framework was dispersed in the aerogel matrix. This continuous interconnected network enhanced the conductivity of ZIF-8 while the porous structure of ZIF-8 facilitated fast mass transport of electrolytes to all the electrochemical active materials. The obtained aerogel electrode delivered high area capacitance of 961 mF cm(-2) at 1 mA cm(-2) according to galvanostatic charge-discharge measurement. This facile structure of graphene aerogel may promote the direct use of MOFs as electrodes in the field of energy storage. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Benzene compounds generates a series of reducing substances under high temperature conditions and is capable of converting insulating polycrystalline C12A7 into a conductive material. Conductive C12A7:e is prepared by placing the C12A7 insulation and benzene compounds together and calcining at 1100 degrees C for a period of time. At present, the conductivity of C12A7:e prepared by this method can be as high as 8.71 S.cm(-1), and the electron concentration can reach 1.68 x 10(20) cm(-3). Studies on the conductive mechanism of C12A7 show that all benzene ring-containing compounds enable to significantly improve its conductivity. Moreover, the process is similar to the industrial preparation methods of cement and ceramics, and does not need to be performed in a vacuum environment, which is considerably suitable for the large-scale industrial manufacture in the future.

AB Low cost, catalyst free porous carbon nanospheres (CNSs) of size 60-70 nm, synthesized from bio-waste products, were used as fillers to fabricate a novel polymer matrix nanocomposite (PMNC) with two different filler contents, viz. 0.1 and 0.25 wt% in an epoxy resin. The composites were tested for their tensile strength and elastic modulus. The 0.25 wt%. composite showed similar to 30% improvement in tensile strength, similar to 7% increase in elastic modulus and similar to 50% increase in % elongation with respect to that of the base resin properties. This study offers exciting structural applications for CNS materials. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Carbon dots (CDs) and Bi-riched bismuth oxyhalide have great potential in the field of photocatalysis. Here, a series of CDs/Bi4O5Br2 at different loading ratios were successfully synthesized by solvothermal method. Experiments of visible light degradation of ciprofloxacin (CIP) showed that 3 wt% CDs/Bi4O5Br2 had the highest activity (5.39 times that of Bi4O5Br2) and the degradation rate reached 98%. The samples were characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM, EDS, Mapping, UV-vis DRS, Raman, and PL spectra. The absorption edge of 3 wt% CDs/Bi4O5Br2 was red-shifted from 455 nm to 580 nm compared with Bi4O5Br2. The enhancement of photocatalytic activity was mainly due to the fact that the addition of CDs not only broadened the photo-response range, but reduced the recombination rate of photo-induced carriers with good electron transport interfaces formed.

AB A flower-like oxidized graphene and metal silver nanoparticles composite (AgNPs@GO) was prepared by a spray-drying and annealing process. The AgNPs@GO exhibits three-dimensional (3D) multi-layer heterojunction structure and high surface area, which can reduce the overpotential of lithium deposition, decrease lithium dendrites, and stabilize lithium storage. Especially, an excellent electrochemical performance is obtained due to the space-confined feature of AgNPs@GO structure. At 0.25 mA cm(-2) for 0.5 mAh cm(-2), the AgNPs@GO-300 reveals a hysteresis voltage of only 32.3 mV at the 10th cycle and a stable coulombic efficiency of 97.1% after nearly 1000 h cycles, indicating promising prospects as lithium metal anode.

By varying SM donor ratios, we observed an enhancement of power conversion efficiency (PCE) from similar to 7% to similar to 9%. This increase in the PCE can be attributed to the Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) as confirmed by steady-state photoluminescence measurements. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Silver nanoparticles supported on nitrogen-doped carbons (Ag/NC) were in situ synthesized by a solution plasma process. In the solution plasma, Ag nanoparticles were produced via the sputtering of Ag electrode, while the NC supports were simultaneously synthesized from 2-cyanopyridine (C6H4N2). The results of the characterization show that Ag nanoparticles had good crystallinity and the NC supports possessed an amorphous structure. The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyzed on Ag/NC proceeded via the co-existence of two and four-electron pathways in alkaline solution, with the four-electron pathway being found to be more dominant. An enhanced ORR activity of Ag/NC was attributed to the synergistic effect of Ag nanoparticles and NC supports. Moreover, Ag/NC exhibited long-term durability and high resistance to methanol oxidation in comparison with the commercial Pt/C catalyst. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In recent year, ultra-compact and high-speed optical logic devices are extremely attractive for the scientific community and optical computing. In this paper, 2 x 1 encoder is proposed and designed using two-dimensional photonic crystal based microstructure. This logic device is constructed by point and line defects in a triangular lattice with silicon rod embedded in air host. The encoder performances are analyzed by using Finite Difference Time Domain method. The numerical results reveal that the designed micro device is capable of working accurately for different logic states. The proposed device is operated at 1520 nm, and it provides a high contrast ratio of 25.82 dB, the excellent response time of 0.2833 ps and a bit rate of around 3.52 Tbps. Hence, it is highly suitable for an optical signal processor and photonic integrated circuits. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Both protic ionic liquids (PILs) and superacids are known to be rich sources of protons and their good carrier as well. Herein, we report a novel approach in developing non-aqueous proton conductive nanocomposite electrolytes (PCNEs) by making composite of a PIL; diethylmethylammonium trifluoromethanesulfonate ([dema][TfO]) and a superacid; perchloric acid (HClO4). Initially, HClO4 was immobilized on nano-silica powders; and then both ([dema][TfO]) and HClO4 center dot SiO2 were incorporated into poly (vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP) matrix. X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy suggest decrease in overall crystallinity of the composite membranes on addition of [dema][TfO]. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images show that microstructures such as spherulite structures and micropores on the membrane surface evolves with [dema][TfO] concentration. At 80 wt% of [dema][TfO], the density of pores appears on the membrane surface is maximum. The dc ionic conductivity is also observed to be increasing with [dema][TfO] concentration. The maximum conductivity of 0.02 mS cm(-1) and 0.6 m Scm(-1) are achieved at room temperature (30 degrees C) and 100 degrees C, respectively for 80 wt% of [dema][TfO]. This ionic conductivity variation is well correlated with the increase in pore density and decreasing crystallinity of the PCNE film. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, the AlCoCrFeNiTi high-entropy alloy (HEA) was prepared as an inoculant to refine the alpha-Al and silicon phases in Al-7Si alloy. The modification mechanism and the existing form of HEA in Al-7Si alloy were studied. The results show that Fe-rich intermetallics including Al, Si, Co, Fe and Ni, precipitated when the 0.2% AlCoCrFeNiTi HEA was added into Al-7Si alloy. In addition, the elements of Ti and Cr uniformly distributed within Al-7Si alloy. The morphology of the eutectic silicon changed from long needle structure to short rod and granular structure. Moreover, the size of alpha-Al grains significantly decreased in Al-7Si-0.2HEA alloy. The mechanical properties of Al-7Si alloy significantly improved. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Osteogenic activity is an indispensible factor that has to be considered when designing antibacterial surfaces for orthopaedic applications. To this aim, a novel DJK-5 peptide was successfully incorporated on a highly porous Ti alloy coating, through the aid of self-polymerization of dopamine. The modified surface demonstrated superior broad spectrum antibacterial efficacy against S. aureus, S. epidermidis and P. aeruginosa, respectively. Simultaneously, the incorporation of DJK-5 peptide stimulated the osteoblastic cell responses, by promoting both cell adhesion and cytoskeleton organization of MC3T3-E1 cells. Such findings would have important implication in designing implant surfaces with both antibacterial efficacy and enhanced osseo-integration potential. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB We have developed a technique for fabricating films of the thermoelectric material, PEDOT/PSS, with enhanced thermoelectric properties via a gel-film formation process. The salient features of the process are 1) the absence of any commonly used pre- and post-treatment steps and 2) wide film thickness control. The new process is different from direct film-formation processes such as the spin-coating and drop-casting methods. The film thickness can be controlled in the range of 1 to 30 mu m. In this study, we investigated the dependence of the electrical conductivity (sigma) and Seebeck coefficient (S) on the film thickness (d). While the value of a increased with decreasing d, S decreased slightly with decreasing d. By this process, values of sigma = 1070 S/cm and S = 16.0 mu V/K were achieved for d = 1.1 mu m, using ethanol as the gelling solvent. Ethanol plays the important roles of removing excess PSS and inducing subsequent gelling. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The structure and morphology of the adsorbent were characterized with FTIR, XRD, EDS, and SEM. In the presence of Cu(II), Ni(II), Zn(II), etc., the adsorption selectivity toward Pb(II) of the adsorbent in aqueous solution was studied, showing that glutaric acid modified Pb (II) imprinted chitosan-based composite membrane had a good adsorption selectivity toward Pb2+ in aqueous solution. The adsorption process of the membrane was under chemical reaction and was in line with the McKay quasi-secondary reaction kinetics model. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The heterogeneous Co3O4-nanowires/vertical-graphene-nanosheets on Ni foam (Co3O4NW/VGN/NF) was synthesized by microwave plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (MPCVD) and hydrothermal process. The morphology of Co3O4NW/VGN/NF shows a uniform porous structure. The Co3O4NW/VGN/NF electrode exhibits a high area specific capacitance of 8.44 F cm(-2) at 5 mA cm(-2). The excellent capacitive performance of the composite material can be ascribed to the improved charge transfer rate and ion diffusion path. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A freestanding thin-film composite with carbon nanotubes/carbon fiber modified by sulfur (S-CNTs/CF) has been fabricated by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method as the binder-free cathode for lithium sulfur battery. This porous electronic conductor with 3D structure improved the electrochemical performance of the cathodes by simultaneously increasing porosity of material and changing conductive pathway. Electrochemical test results showed that the discharge specific capacity of S-CNTs/CF positive electrode decreased slightly from initial 1213.6 mAh g((sulfur))(1) to 798.4 mAh g((sulfur))(1) after 55 cycles. Comparing with powder cathode, the electrochemical performance of S-CNTs/CF cell is improved significantly. It proves that establishing a sulfur electrode with stable conductive and high porous structure provide a promising way to improve the cycle life. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of this work is the synthesis of geopolymers from dredged sediments in calcined and uncalcined states. Different amounts of dredged sediments (0, 5,10, 15 and 20 wt%) were introduced within geopolymers paste. Investigations show that dredging sediments were mainly composed by calcite, muscovite and kaolinite. It was demonstrated that highest compressive strength of 22 MPa and durability in hydrochloric acid solution of the geopolymers were obtained when 15 wt% of calcined dredging sediment were added, this is due to more stable geopolymer matrix. In the other hand, calcination activates dredged sediment by changing its crystallinity into an amorphous structure of higher reactivity in alkaline solution. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB An extremely simple and environmentally friendly water treatment was developed to enhance the general corrosion resistance of biomedical high nitrogen nickel-free stainless steels (HNNFS). After treatment, the corrosion rate of HNNFS could dramatically reduce to 1/20 of the untreated in 37 degrees C 0.9 wt% NaCl solutions. Then the passive film on HNNFS was analyzed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). It was found that Cr enrichment and thickness increase of passive film contributed to the improvement of general corrosion resistance of HNNFS. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, the influence of sinter-hardening process on Astaloy Mo based powder metallurgical steels was investigated. In line with this purpose, diffusion alloyed Distaloy DH (Astaloy Mo-2 wt% Cu) with 0,6 wt% C, Astaloy Mo with 2 wt% Cu-0,6 wt% C, and Astaloy Mo with 1 wt% Cu-0,6 wt% C powder mixes were chosen. Due to these compositions, the effects of copper amounts, cooling rates and prealloying methods on mechanical properties and microstructures of mentioned powders were examined. Aim of the work was to determine the proper parameters for Fe-Mo-Cu-C alloys in order to be able to use them more common in automotive industry. In line with this objective, transverse rupture strength, tensile strength and microhardness tests and also microscopical investigations were performed. In consequence of the experimental studies, it was observed that increase of cooling rate led to transformation of bainite to martensite and increase of hardness. However, increasing cooling rate caused decreases in the strength values of all specimens. Besides, it was determined that Distaloy DH specimens had better strength values owing to having less porous structure and smaller pores in comparison to other specimens. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB The formation of anatase structure usually requires high-temperature heat treatment at 450-500 degrees C for 30-150 min, which causes energy waste, particle agglomeration and significant loss of photocatalytic performance of TiO2. In this paper, we proposed a low-temperature quick-making strategy for visible light-responsive TiO2, which involves ultrahigh electron density cold plasma spraying combined with rapid heating (CPRH) treatment at a quite lower temperature than traditional methods. We explored the effect of calcination temperature and time on the crystallization behavior of the plasma sprayed TiO2. Anatase crystal structures are found in CPRH samples calcined at 275 degrees C in 10 min. The decrease of Ti3+, the increase of N-doping, and the preservation of -OH groups are detected in CPRH-300 samples. Also, the higher visible-light photoactivity than the conventional sol-gel TiO2 crystallized at 450 degrees C is obtained. The proposed cost-effective CPRH strategy demonstrates significant practical value for energy conservation. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A series of surface-modified lithium ion adsorbents was synthesized in a pH-controlled solution using impregnation method; different oligomeric metal-hydroxide precursors were added on the surface of a spinel-type manganese oxide (Li1.33Mn1.67O4), which was then heat treated. X-ray diffractometry indicated that the crystal structure of spinel was maintained after heating. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that their surfaces were partially covered with metal-oxide layers of 10-20 nm thickness. Loaded metal-oxide contents in mass % were 7.1 of Al and 11.8 of Ni, respectively. The effect of metal-oxide species on chemical stability of the resulting materials in 0.25 mol dm( 3) H2SO4 solution was investigated by inductively-coupled plasma spectrometry. Metal-oxide coated Li1.33Mn1.67O4 showed lower manganese dissolution and higher lithium extraction, compared with that of the raw Li1.33Mn1.67O4. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, a cathode-plasma electrolysis setup with atmospheric pressure pin-to-solution electrical discharge in air and AgNO3 aqueous solution is used. The experiment shows that a black powder is generated at the plasma-solution interface. Through X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) and Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR), the black powder is found to be Ag2O2 combined with a small amount of Ag2CO3. Field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) images reveal that the powder is a mixture of sub-micrometer (>200 nm) Ag2O2 polygonal particles and Ag2CO3 nanospheres of <70 nm diameter.

AB Reaction of aniline with KMnO4 could produce polyaniline-supported Mn nanocomposites (Mn@PANI). In comparison with conventional method for the synthesis of PANI-supported metal nanoparticles, this reaction did not require additional oxidant. As a Mn-containing material, Mn@PANI was initially expected to be a good catalyst for oxidation reaction and its catalytic activity was tested by using the oxidative deoximation reaction. Surprisingly, instead of the expected catalytic activity, the material restrained the reaction on the contrary. It was found to be an easily removable heterogeneous free radical scavenger that could inhibit the unwanted decomposition reactions caused by free radicals so that the lifetime of the chemical products could be extended.

AB A series of MoO3 catalysts supported on SiO2 were prepared. The aim of this work is to understand the factors that determine their catalytic performance in hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of fatty acids. The impregnation of Mo species was carried out by using citric acid (CA) or malonic acid (MA) in aqueous solutions. The use of organic acids resulted in changing the oxidation states of Mo in the materials. The performance of the catalyst prepared with CA was the best in this series. We found that oxidation states of Mo species play a major role in the HDO of palmitic acid. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID ENHANCED PHOTOCATALYTIC DEGRADATION; TIO2
AB In this work, heterojunctioned TiO2/ZrO2 - zirconium titanate phases have been designed through a precursor derived approach. The X-ray powder diffractograms (XRD) revealed that the synthesized powder contained phase pure rutile, a mixture of rutile/zirconia and zirconium titanate or monoclinic zirconia (m-ZrO2) as we vary the amount of initial precursors. The scanning electron micrographs (SEM) and transmission electron micrographs (TEM) showed a decrease in crystallite size with increase in the amount of Zr to Ti precursor and formation of heterojunctions, respectively. An anomalous reduction in band gap was observed for 70T-30Z (2.54 eV) and 60T-40Z (2.71 eV) samples when compared to their parent oxides, TiO2 (2.86 eV) and ZrO2 (4.5 eV) and this could be attributed to the formation of heterojunctions between the two phases.

ID FILM
AB Tin sulfide (SnS) is a promising absorber material for photovoltaic cells, because of its optimum band gap, strong optical absorption, simple phase composition, earth-abundant and nontoxic constituents. However, this material is largely unexploited to date with only a handful of studies reporting SnS for photovoltaic application. We present systematic preparation of SnS thin films through thermal evaporation route and characterize phase composition of these films. We have observed that the films grown at the substrate temperature of 250 degrees C exhibit a single SnS phase, which could be alternative light absorber materials for photovoltaic devices fabrication. Hence, a solar conversion efficiency of 1.47% was obtained at standard one sun illumination using a planar device consisting of FTO/TiO2/SnS/P3HT/Au. The present findings offer novel directions for achieving high-efficiency solid-state solar cells by hybridization of inorganic-organic light harvesters and hole transporters. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB We present micromechanical experiments of DC magnetron sputtered high-entropy nitride thin films, single-phase (Al,Ta,Ti,V,Zr)N with nearly equimolar metal-fractions, and of their Si-alloyed variant. The (Al,Ta,Ti,V,Zr)N coating exhibits a hardness of similar to 30 GPa and a fracture toughness of 2.4 MPa root m. Alloying this high-entropy nitride with similar to 5 at% Si does not influence the hardness and fracture toughness but lowers significantly the elastic response. Consequently, the elastic strain to failure increases by more than 30% leading to a significantly improved damage tolerance for the Si alloyed (Al,Ta,Ti,V,Zr)N. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Implementing novel approaches for cancer therapy are under continuous progress, and bioactive glasses (BGs) and glass-ceramics show excellent potential in this regard. Although these materials have been mostly used as magnetic substances in hyperthermia approach, some of their subsets, i.e., mesoporous bioactive glasses (MBGs), have been recently proposed not only as magnetic materials but also as drug delivery systems for advanced treatment of bone cancer. Different types of MBGs including granular particles and three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds can be applied for cancer therapy. Based on the results obtained from in vitro studies, MBGs seem to have a bright future in the therapeutic strategies to combat cancer; however, their application in this field is still in its beginning, and more research needs to reveal all pros and cons of this newly proposed approach.

AB The Abstractive summarization is challenging problem, especially abstractive summarization based on unsupervised learning because it must generate whole, unique sentences. In the real world, companies use abstractive summarization to understand customer feedbacks. In many cases, this work is done by humans and so is expensive in terms of time and money. Therefore, there is an increasing demand for machine learning-based abstractive summarization systems. However, most previous abstractive summarization studies were of supervised models. In this paper, we proposed novel abstractive summarization methods that can be trained unsupervisedly. One of the proposed methods is based on Adversarially Regularized Autoencoder(ARAE) model, but abstractive summary generation method for each cluster of similar customers' reviews, is newly proposed. We further proposed Conditional Adversarially Regularized Autoencoder(CARAE) model which is similar to the ARAE model but with the addition of condition nodes so that additional information about the cluster can be used during summarization. We first performed summary experiments based on Korean and additionally performed experiments on English. In the experiments, we set up some comparison models and used ROUGE and BLEU to evaluate our proposed models' performance. Overall, our proposed models outperformed the comparison models and CARAE model performed better than the ARAE model. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Over the last 30 years, Al & Law has provided breakthroughs in studies involving case-based reasoning, rule-based reasoning, information retrieval and, most recently, conceptual models for knowledge representation and reasoning, known as Legal Ontologies. Ontologies have been widely used by legal practitioners, scholars, and lay people in a variety of situations, such as simulating legal actions, semantic search and indexing, and to keep up-to-date with the continual change of laws and regulations. Given the high number of legal ontologies produced, the need to summarize this research realm through a well-defined methodological procedure is urgent need. This study presents the results of a systematic mapping of the literature, aiming at categorizing legal ontologies along certain dimensions, such as purpose, level of generality, underlying legal theories, among other aspects. The reasons to carry out a systematic mapping are twofold: in addition to explaining the maturation of the area over recent decades, it helps to avoid the old problem of reinventing the wheel. Through organizing and classifying what has already been produced, it is possible to realize that the development of legal ontologies can rise to the level of reusability where prefabricated models might be coupled with new and more complex ontologies for practical law.

ID RECOGNITION
AB Traditional commercial automated fingerprint recognition systems (AFRSs) are vulnerable to fake attacks by the use of artificial fingerprints, due to its limitation on resolution and the difficulty of obtaining depth information. Developing new systems with strong anti-spoofing ability are of increasing concern in the current digital age. Inspired by the observation and comparison of fingertip skin structure and the one dimensional (1D) depth signals derived from OCT acquisition images between real finger and artificial fingerprints, two novel anti-spoofing features, namely depth-double-peak feature and sub-single-peak feature, were specifically defined. Depth-double-peak feature refers that there must be two and only two peaks in the 1D depth signal which reflects the double-peak structure of real fingertip skin. While sub single-peak feature means that there must be a peak in the ID depth signal intercepted before the maximum peak which distinguishes the extra layer covered on a real finger. Real and fake images could be presented by these two features and classified by a pre-learned threshold. Four types of artificial fingerprint, i.e., Normal Thickness Fingerprint Layer (NTFL), thin Fingerprint Layer (TFL), Ultra-Thin Fingerprint Layer (UTFL and Artificial Fingers Model (AFM) were collected to verify system robustness. 30 sets of real finger data (each set includes 400 images) and 60 sets of artificial fingerprint data (15 sets of each type) were collected by our designed OCT device. Experimental results show that our proposed anti-spoofing system could achieve 100% accuracy over all four types of artificial fingerprints and outperform the other automated anti-spoofing method in comparison.

AB Text classification is one of the popular high dimensional classification problems where providing better feature vector representations explicitly improve classification performances. Thus, assigning appropriate weights to features or terms are crucial for obtaining effective feature vector representations. The methods used for weighting terms in text classification are called term weighting schemes. Although there exist some term weighting schemes for text classification, they are not fully effective and researchers still focus on proposing new term weighting schemes. In this study, two novel term weighting schemes namely SQRT_TF-IGM(imp) and TF-IGM(imp) derived from standard inverse gravity moment formula are proposed to improve weighting behaviors of existing TF-IGM scheme especially for some extreme cases. The performances of proposed schemes are compared with two standard IGM based schemes and five other state-of-the-art term weighting methods on both unbalanced (Reuters-21578) and balanced (20 Mini Newsgroups and 20 Newsgroups) datasets with KNN, SVM, and NN classifiers. Micro-F1 and macro-F1 are used as success measures. The experiments are conducted with various different feature sizes to examine the effects of the feature size on the success of weighting. The experimental results showed that the proposed SQRT_TF-IGM(imp) method generally outperformed all schemes including both standard TF-IGM and SQRT_TF-IGM schemes. However, the proposed TF-IGMimp scheme also showed mostly better performance than standard TF-IGM. To demonstrate validity of the proposed weighting scheme having maximum performance, t-test is also used and it can be stated that the performance gains obtained by the proposed SQRT_TF-IGM(imp) weighting scheme compared to standard SQRT_TF-IGM are statistically significant.

AB Automated detection of fire flames in videos shot from a surveillance camera is an active research topic, as fire detection must be accurate and fast. The present study proposes and evaluates an efficient fire detection method. The contributions of this method lies in threefold: (1) a robust ICA (Imperialist Competitive Algorithm) K-medoids-based color model first is developed to reliably detect all candidate fire regions in a scene; (2) a motion-intensity-aware motion detection technique is introduced to simply extract the regions containing movement together with the motion intensity rate of every moving pixel, which are then used to analyze the characteristics of the fire; (3) a set of new spatio-temporal features having the distinct characteristics of fire flames are extracted from the candidate fire regions which are fed into a support vector machine classifier in order to distinguish real fire regions from non-real ones. The experimental results for a set of benchmark fire video datasets and videos provided in this research confirm that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art fire detection approaches, providing high detection accuracy and a low false detection rate.

AB This paper analyses the recently proposed article "A feature reduced intrusion detection system using ANN classifier" by Akashdeep, Ishfaq Manzoor & Neeraj Kumar, (Expert systems with Applications, 2017) which has a limitation in its experimental setup. The work of Akashdeep et.al has crafted the test dataset to attain improved accuracy. They have utilized 5 fractional test datasets for performance evaluation. The reduced list of features obtained in their work does not give the asserted performance for the original test dataset. Table 18 of the above article by Akashdeep et.al gives the performance comparison of their work with existing works which isn't appropriate as these works have different test dataset composition. Another issue with the work of Akashdeep et.al is the utilization of partial training dataset for determining the reduced list of features. Their work reduces the training dataset by random undersampling of the majority class instances and random replication of the minority class instances. The reduced list of features obtained by Akashdeep et.al comprises 25 features. This work applies the feature selection algorithm proposed by Akashdeep et.al on the original training dataset leading to a feature subset having 29 features. It has been observed experimentally that the reduced feature subset (29 features) obtained in later outperforms the former reduced feature set (25 features). This work uses the classification algorithms c4.5, Naive Bayes and Random Forest for performance comparison of these reduced feature sets. Oversampling one class may deteriorate the performance of another class. This work also evaluates random undersampling/oversampling of a specific class to design an optimal training dataset. The results show that the classification models developed using this training dataset have a better detection rate for the minority classes. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
