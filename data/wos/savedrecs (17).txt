AB Tb3+/Yb3+ co-doped precursor glass was synthesized by melt quenching method, and transparent glassceramic was prepared by heat treatment the precursor glass. Comparing the X-ray diffraction patterns of precursor glass and glass-ceramic showed that the Na3.6Y1.8(PO4)(3) crystals were formed after heat treatment. By the scanning electron microscopy images of glass-ceramic, the grainy crystal grains were observed dispersed in the glass matrix. The structure of precursor glass and glass-ceramic was studied by FTIR spectra and Raman spectra, indicating that phosphate group was formed in glass-ceramic. The up-conversion luminescent intensity of glass-ceramic was obviously enhanced than precursor glass. Moreover, the luminescence quantum yield of the glass-ceramic sample showed higher than precursor glass, which can be attributed to the formation of phosphate groups in glass-ceramic.

AB A double-layer organic photodetector with solution-processed interconnecting layers composed of a spincoated ZnOx layer and a spray-coated poly(N,N'-bis-4-butylphenyl-N,N'-bisphenyl)benzidine (Poly-TPD) layer is fabricated. The result showed that the double-layer device effectively suppresses the dark current by 2 orders of magnitude, compared to its single layer counterpart. Interestingly, the photocurrent under reverse bias also significantly increased. As a result, the double-layer photodetector showed high on/off ratio of 2.6 x 10(4) and the detectivity is up to 6.5 x 10(12) Jones at -1.5 V. The strategy of spin-coating combining with spray-coating sequentially to form solution-processed interconnecting layers can be an effective and facile way to produce high-detectivity solution-processible organic photodetectors.

AB A novel hierarchically N-doped carbon coated MoS2 microflower assembled with nanosheets is synthesized via a SiO2-templete assisted hydrothermal method. Differing from the traditional synthesis mechanism of the similar micro-/nanostructure, the wrinkled 2D MoS2 grains grow in the pore of the assembled SiO2 aggregates with squeezing action. In the designed macro-/nanostructure, the interconnected network of carbon coated nanosheets increases surface area and decreases transfering resistance for ions and electrons, which is beneficial to conductivity and total electrode capability. The self-supported structure alleviates volume change and improves cycling stability. This synthesized MoS2@NC exhibits high capacity and remarkable cycling stability. It shows initial capacity of 1103.6 mAh g( 1) and maintains a reversible capacity of 786.4 mAh g (1) after 50 cycles at 0.1 A g (1). (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The presented work demonstrates the capability of producing Ti-22Al-25Nb parts from Ti, Al, Nb elemental powders using Binder Jetting (BJ) additive manufacturing (AM) method followed by high-temperature reactive sintering and subsequent annealing. The microstructural investigation and phase analysis demonstrate that reactive sintering at 800 degrees C and 1000 degrees C results in diffusion of Al into Ti particles forming Ti-Al solid solution and Ti3Al-phase, while sintering at 1100 degrees C allows Nb diffusion into Ti particles. Microstructural analysis showed that the reactive sintering temperature affects the surface morphology of particles due to different wettability of liquid Al. Annealing at 1400 degrees C resulted in the formation of B2/beta-phase with acicular Ti2AlNb precipitates. The results demonstrate that the used approach can be successfully utilized for the production of Ti-22Al-25Nb parts. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Ultra-light aluminum borate foams (ABFs) with porosity ranging from 92.18 to 86.82 vol% were fabricated by combining foam-casting and freeze-drying using alumina and boron carbide as raw materials. The effects of heating temperature on phase evaluation and the influence of solid content of slurries on the physical properties and formation mechanism of the three-dimensional interconnected hierarchical pore structure in ABFs were investigated. The contacting of bubbles, burning loss of organics, replacement of ice crystals by alcohol, and interlocking of rod-like aluminum borate crystal together created a hierarchical pore structure in foams. The results revealed that the performance and microstructure of ABFs could be controlled by adjusting the solid content of slurries. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Growing uniform surface oxides is vital for fabricating 2D materials based electronic and optoelectronic devices. However, the surface transition metal oxides (TMDs) of air-exposure transitional metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), such as HfOx on HfSe2, are island-type, with poor TMOs/TMDs interface quality. Here, we report a controlled surface oxidation of atomically thin HfSe2 flakes via oxygen-plasma treatment, where a dense atomically flat HfOx film is produced. This HfOx film is found to be a good surface passivation layer to prevent the inner part from further oxidation in air, which is also promising as a high-K dielectric in HfSe2-based devices.

XRD and Raman spectral analysis are exploited to emphasize the chemical homogeneity and structural sensitivity, which revealing an unpolluted phase with a structural transition of Tetragonal to Pseudo-cubic on Nd doping. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra have facilitated the aboriginal role of defects present in the samples through g factor of 1.997 and 1.968. A typical broad EPR signal with g-factor 2.413 for BNTC-1 ensures the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) signal. It unveiled that the magnetic micro-domain state arises due to the existence of complex defects. Thus, inducing a magnetic saturation in M-H curve of BNTC-1 at high field strength, unlike the short-range ferromagnetism (FM) with diamagnetic ordering has observed in the other samples. These results indict that the short range and long range FM ordering ascribed to the crucial role of defects. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, a novel double-layered anti-reflection (AR) structure involving SiO2 and ZnO films was applied to modify the optical and electrical performance of FTO conducting glass for DSSCs. A SiO2 anti-reflection (AR) layer was fabricated on the non-conducting surface of FTO by spraying method, and a ZnO layer was prepared by spin-coating method on the conducting surface of FTO. The ZnO film not only plays the role of an AR coating layer, but also plays the role of an ancillary layer which restrains charge recombination. The combined use of SiO2 and ZnO AR thin films can improve the performance of the dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) effectively, the current density increases from 10.79 to 12.90 mA/cm(2) and the conversion efficiency enhances from 4.67% to 5.79%, respectively.

AB Injectable, strongly compressible nanomicelle hydrogels (NMgels) were prepared by photo-initiated free radical copolymerization of methacrylated hyaluronate acid (MeHA) and Pluronic F127 diacrylate (F127DA) micelles. The gelation of precursor solutions occurred with short irradiation times of 25 s and hardened within 120 s. The obtained NMgels display outstanding mechanical properties with compressive strength, modulus and fracture energy up to about 3.44 MPa, 0.31 MPa and 1204 J/m(2), respectively. The hydrogels also showed excellent anti-fragility and self-recovery capability due to the dense and strong micelle networks. In addition, the prepared NMgels exhibited low swelling ratios and a well-maintained network even after 90 days in pH = 7.4 phosphate buffer saline. This study presents a tough biocompatible hydrogel that has promising applications especially in load-bearing tissue systems. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB During irradiation or high-temperature aging, stainless steel can develop precipitates, significantly affecting mechanical properties. In this study atom probe tomography (APT) was used to study grain boundary segregation and secondary phases in a purely austenitic SS304 (a Fe-18Cr-8Ni steel) processed by high-pressure torsion (HPT) at 300 degrees C. Ni, Mn, Si enriched phase was observed at grain boundaries, and Cu nanoprecipitates were observed along and near phase/grain boundaries. Precipitation is facilitated by deformation assisted segregation along grain boundaries with a mechanism similar to vacancy diffusion in irradiated steels. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID SUBSTITUTED HYDROXYAPATITE
AB The feasibility of incorporating high (M/M+Ca = 16 mol. %) and low (M/M+Ca = 4.76 mol. %) concentrations of Mg2+, Zn2+ and Sr2+, as divalent cations with interesting biological properties, into the structure of well-known bioceramic: hydroxyapatite (HA) was carefully assessed. An established hydrothermal synthesis method was employed for preparation of HA in whisker-like morphology. Consequently, the possibility of synthesizing HA whiskers (HAWs) with cationic substitutions and effects of the introduced ions on morphology, structure and composition of HA products were evaluated. Almost, all the cation-substituted preparations could maintain the apatite phase, while the decrease in crystallite size and crystallinity was obvious. Lattice parameters (a, c) of the hexagonal system of HA were also affected in accordance with the type and amount of substituting cation. Zn(2+ )and high amounts of Mg2+ dramatically inhibited formation of whisker-like apatite and promoted formation of a mixture of hexagonal prism-like and flaky bundles, or hexagonal and multifaceted morphologies, respectively. However, Sr2+ exhibited minimum inhibitory effect on HAWs formation. Therefore, Sr- and Mg-substituted (low concentration of Mg) HAWs could be prepared for their potential biomedical applications.

ID DIATOMITE
AB Nanopores are very important to the moisture adsorption properties of humidity self-regulating ceramics (HSCs). As nanopores disappear easily during high temperature firing processes, it is important to prepare HSCs at low firing temperatures. But such materials generally lack the mechanical strength needed to meet building material standards. Accordingly, this study used fumed silica as a body enhancer added to volcanic mud raw material to prepare an HSC. The effects of fumed silica content, water addition and firing temperature on flexural strength, porosity, and moisture adsorption were investigated in detail. The results show that, by controlling the amounts of fumed silica and water added, the HSC can achieve high moisture adsorption of 302 g/m(2). Furthermore, its flexural strength is greater than 12 MPa by only firing at 600 degrees C, owing to the formation of calcium silicate hydrate in the porcelain green bodies. These results indicate that this proposed method is a very promising and simple approach to the preparation of high strength performance humidity self-regulating porous ceramics.

AB Specific structures of esophagus play an important role in specific functions. However, current esophageal tissue engineering scaffolds replicate them poorly. To address this issue, the objective of this study is to fabricate a hierarchical PCL/F127 scaffold inspired by the natural esophageal structure. The hierarchical scaffold consists of aligned fibers in micro-size and thin film with nano-sized pores through combining E-jetting and E-spraying. The aligned fibers of scaffold guide the orientation and induce the elongation of fibroblasts, mimicking the uniformly oriented esophageal muscles. Furthermore, the film functioned as a protective barrier to replicate the esophageal mucosa. Meanwhile, the film also increases cell adhesion area, hence, improving cell proliferation. These two features of the fabricated hierarchical scaffold mimic the structure of natural esophagus. Moreover, fabricated hierarchical scaffold possesses comparable mechanical properties to natural esophagus. These results prove the potential of fabricated scaffold for esophagus tissue repair.

AB Sub-wavelength features are directly patterned on the surface of a nanocrystalline beta-SiC thin film using femtosecond laser irradiation. The Sub-wavelength features form due to incident laser light's interference with surface plasmons. The laser incidence is normal to the surface of the thin film, and the patterning experiments are carried out in the air. Laser polarization is used to control the shape of the surface features, i.e., linear polarization gives linearly oriented features while circular polarization gives near-circular features without altering the phase and crystal structure of SiC.

AB The distribution and structure of second phases in an Mg-12Al-6.5Ca-1Nd alloy prepared by spray deposition technique were studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) combination of energy dispersion spectrum (EDS) mapping. Results show that several Al2Ca particles nucleated on the Al2Nd phase, revealing the initial liquid appearance of Al2Nd which finally led to the formation of heterogeneous nucleation sites. Low interfacial energy between the phases caused by closed lattice parameters is responsible for the heterogeneous nucleation. The crystallization sequence can be explained satisfactorily by the phase stability obtained from first-principles calculations. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Optimised ZnO nanorods characteristics are essential for novel devices to operate efficiently. The effects of vacuum annealing on the electrical transport properties and defect chemistry of ZnO nanorods have been studied. Annealing to 500 degrees C removed surface contamination causing reduced resistance while annealing to 600 degrees C created acceptor defects, changing the contact type from ohmic to rectifying. At 700 degrees C donor defects reduced leading to increased resistance while annealing to 800 degrees C caused a reduction in all defects and decreased resistance. This suggests that contact resistance is the major contributor to the system's resistance rather than the inherent material resistance alone. The results indicate that contact type can be controlled by manipulating the defect chemistry via controlled annealing. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID AQUEOUS EXTRACT
AB Noble metals nanoparticles have shown interesting prospects towards biomedical applications, and their bimetallic counterparts are envisaged to be more promising. In this study, the Stigmaphyllon ovatum leaf extract was used for the synthesis of silver, gold and silver-gold bimetallic nanoparticles (AgNPs, AuNPs and Ag-Au BNPs) in an aqueous medium. Surface plasmon bands were obtained at 420, 550 and 542 nm for the AgNPs, AuNPs and Ag-Au BNPs respectively. Only one absorption band was observed in the spectra of the bimetallic nanoparticles, which suggested the formation of a nanoalloy. Particle sizes of about 24, 80 and 15 nm were obtained for the AgNPs, AuNPs and Ag-Au BNPs respectively. The effect of the nanoparticles on Human cervical carcinoma (HeLa) cells revealed cytotoxic effects towards the growth of the carcinoma cells with the IC50 values of 5.75 x 10( 16), 9.1 x 10( 9) and 0.0027 mu M for the Ag-Au BNPs, AgNPs and AuNPs, respectively. The nanoparticles were excellently efficient compared to the standard drug, 5-fluorouracil with an IC50 value of 40 mu M. These nanoparticles however opened up new perspectives in research and may provide promising alternative approaches for nano-drug development in the next generation of effective anticancer drugs.

AB We fabricated the amorphous GeTe/cubic Sb2Te3 supperlattice-like structure films by the radio frequency sputtering, and demonstrated the stability of cubic Sb2Te3 could be strengthened. The competition between interface energy and phase transformation energy resulted in the thermodynamical stability at the nanoscale. The presented design approach opens the doors for the stabilization of metastable phase, and sheds new insights into the role of interfaces in materials synthesis. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The experimental results revealed that SLM 316L SS could be sensitized at 650 degrees C as the treatment duration was larger than 6 h. Formation of the precipitated phases that accelerated by the sub-grain boundaries was responsible for the high susceptibility of SLM 316L SS to intergranular corrosion. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

HPT leads to the formation of a nanocrystalline structure with a predominant grain size of 11-34 nm. HPT causes the refining of eutectic [(Al) + Al4Ca] and the formation of nanoclusters and segregations.

AB The low temperature plasticity behavior of a nanostructured microalloyed steel was studied at varied deformation temperatures and strain rates. Tensile condition of 500 degrees C (0.33 melting point) and 0.00005 s (1) led to superplastic flow with a low peak stress of 140 MPa and a high elongation of 202%. The ultra-fine equiaxed ferrite kept high misorientation grain boundaries and absent of dislocations subjected to superplastic strain, accounted for grain boundary sliding mechanisms. Slip deformation was required at strain rate of 0.00025 s (1) or deformation temperature of 450 degrees C based on a relatively high dislocation density. Low temperature superplasticity in NG/UFG steel was highly strain rate and temperature dependent. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE Photo-induced dielectrics; Electrical properties; Defect dipole
AB Ba0.85Ca0.15Zr0.1Ti0.9O3-based ceramics with doping of Ca3Co4O9, CaMn0.98Nb0.02O3, and Zn0.08Al0.02O were fabricated. CaO and CaCO3 secondary phase were observed in all doped ceramics. These phases caused vacancies of Ca ions, which became associated with oxygen vacancies induced by ultraviolet light, leading to the formation of a defect dipole. The defect dipoles enhanced the photo-induced dielectric properties. The maximum enhancement was about 60% with Ca3Co4O9 doping while other ceramics did not show significant change. The results here suggested that the ultraviolet light-induced dielectric properties of Ba0.85Ca0.15Zr0.1Ti0.9O3 ceramic may be largely tunable by Ca3Co4O9 addition and could be an alternative material for light sensors.

AB To search a viable way to enhance the photoconversion efficiency (PCE) of Quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs), we have designed a method of introducing a hole transporting layer (HTL) of p-type CuS to form the TiO2/Bi2S3/CuS composite electrodes. The morphology, crystal structure, optical properties and PEC performance of TiO2/Bi2S3/CuS composite electrodes were investigated in detail. The results showed that the photocurrent density of TiO2/Bi2S3/CuS was eight times higher than that of single TiO2 and 1.51 times higher than that of TiO2/Bi2S3 NRs. Therefore, this study provides helpful insights into rational design and fabrication of novel and efficient method for improving PEC performance of the QDSSCs. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB ZnO and MoS2/ZnO composite were synthesized by co-precipitation method and their structural and optical properties were studied using XRD, Raman, and photoluminescence spectroscopy. The MoS2/ZnO composite has shown 40% enhancement in photocatalytic degradation of an organic dye as compared to ZnO. The contribution of active species such as superoxide (O-center dot(2)), hydroxyl radical (center dot OH), and hole (h(+)) in the photocatalytic process were tested and their role was ordered as follows( center dot)O(2) > center dot OH > h(+). In total, the enhancement in photocatalytic performance of composite was correlated to specific surface area, association of all active species, and the synergistic effect between MoS(2 )and ZnO.

AB 2,3-Dimethylquinoxaline-4-chlorobenzenesulphonate (DMQPCS) was synthesized successfully and grown as single crystals from 1:1 MeOH and water solvent mixture using slow evaporation method. Single crystal XRD analysis confirms that the molecular salt crystallizes in orthorhombic system with non-centrosymmetric space group, Pca21 and the crystal is stabilized by N+-H center dot center dot center dot O, O-H center dot center dot center dot O, N-H center dot center dot center dot O and C-H center dot center dot center dot O hydrogen bonding interactions. The presence of expected functional groups and the molecular structure were identified by FT-IR and NMR spectroscopic studies. Lower cut-off wavelength, % transmittance and optical band-gap value were determined by UV-Vis-NIR spectral analysis. The photoluminescence studies confirm green emission radiation. The thermal and mechanical behaviour were analyzed by TG-DTA analyses and Vickers microhardness tester, respectively. The SHG efficiency and laser damage threshold were measured using an Nd:YAG laser of wavelength 1064 nm. Variation of the dielectric response of the grown crystal was studied at different temperatures. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID FILMS
AB Organic-inorganic perovskite materials, such as methylammonium lead iodide, are good candidates for the next generation of solar cells with an impressive certified 23.7% power conversion efficiency. However, their development is impeded by their poor stability to oxygen, moisture, light and combinations of these. The bulk photoluminescence of perovskite films is extremely sensitive to the environment (humidity, light intensity, temperature, atmosphere) and has been shown to undergo rapid photobrightening and photodarkening. Here, we study the changes in photoluminescence behaviour (intensity, wavelength and full-width-at-half-maximum) in both air and nitrogen and correlate this with changes in the crystal structure of the films under illumination. We show that photodarkening is caused by degradation of the perovskite and that both brightening and some degree of darkening are competitive processes occurring simultaneously. During photobrightening the fluorescence emission spectrum red-shifts which can be explained by the halide redistribution and passivation of trap states in the perovskite. We conclude that care is required when measuring fluorescence of perovskite due to the important variations in intensity, emission wavelength and full-width-at-half-maximum.

The effect of electromagnetic field on the cross-sectional morphology, the microstructure and the element distribution was investigated. The results showed that the dilution rate of coatings reduced and the grain size of Cr borides was refined under the electromagnetic field. The volume fraction of Cr borides in the coatings increased and the distribution morphology of phases is related to grain boundary wettability. The length of columnar dendrite crystals at the bottom of the coatings decreased with the increase of the electromagnetic force. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Nowadays, with the widespread access to web 2.0, the social network plays an unbelievable role in knowledge sharing and diffusion of new products. People can share their views and can visit other's opinion about the particular material, news, products, artifacts and, trends, etc. anywhere, anytime, and anywhere. An Opinion leader is a critical person who can change, modify and transform other's view by their knowledge and proficiency. In this article, an innovative approach is proposed to discover the top-N local and global opinion leader within the community and social network respectively. Initially, we identified the community structure within the social network using the modified Louvain method and next identified the opinion leader using a modified firefly algorithm in each community. We also determined the global opinion leader within the same social network using the same firefly algorithm. The proposed approach is exceptionally supportive to expert and intelligent system because it competently discovered the local optimum concurrently in each subgroup of the social network. All the users can update its attractiveness value without any supposition, and as soon as the distance among the user's increases, the other users can automatically create another subgroup in the network and form the local community. In addition, as the population size in the network increases, the entire users measure their prominence simultaneously. Therefore, there is no consequence on computational time and accuracy of the algorithm. Thus, the proposed algorithm Is superlative suitable for discovering the opinion leader in the local community and globally in the social network. For legalized the proposed approach, we implemented our proposed method on synthesized as well as on real dataset. Finally, we concluded that both the recommended procedures are much better concerning the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score with the widely used standard Social Network Analysis (SNA) measures.

ID ROUGH; SYSTEMS; SETS; MODEL
AB Record linkage is a typical two-class recognition problem in data mining. To improve its classification performance of the problem, this paper proposes to apply three-way classification to identify uncertain points (regions) for further clerical investigation in decision-making. The detailed three-way decision process is realized by a two-phase approach. During the first phase, an information granule is constructed to describe the uncertain region in the data space. In the second phase, the constructed granule is utilized to discriminate between certain points (those with a high likelihood of belonging to one of the classes) and uncertain points (viz. those requiring clerical attention).

AB Software fault prediction (SFP) is typically used to predict faults in software components. Machine learning techniques (e.g., classification) are widely used to tackle this problem. With the availability of the huge amount of data that can be obtained from mining software historical repositories, it becomes possible to have some features (metrics) that are not correlated with the faults, which consequently mislead the learning algorithm and thus decrease its performance. One possible solution to eliminate those metrics is Feature Selection (FS). In this paper, a novel FS approach is proposed to enhance the performance of a layered recurrent neural network (L-RNN), which is used as a classification technique for the SFP problem. Three different wrapper FS algorithms (i.e, Binary Genetic Algorithm (BGA), Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO), and Binary Ant Colony Optimization (BACO)) were employed iteratively. To assess the performance of the proposed approach, 19 real-world software projects from PROMISE repository are investigated and the experimental results are discussed. Receiver operating characteristic- area under the curve (ROC-AUC) is used as a performance measure. The results are compared with other state of -art approaches including Naive Bayes (NB), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), logistic regression (LR), the k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) and C4.5 decision trees, in terms of area under the curve (AUC). Our results have demonstrated that the proposed approach can outperform other existing methods. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Discriminative sequential patterns are sub-sequences whose occurrences exhibit significant differences across sequential data sets with different class labels. The discovery of such types of patterns has many practical applications in different fields. To date, various algorithms for mining discriminative sequential patterns have been proposed. However, the reported patterns from these methods usually contain many false positives that only hold in the sample data by chance. To alleviate this issue, we put forward the concept of significance-based discriminative sequential pattern mining and a corresponding algorithm DSPM-MTC (Discriminative Sequential Pattern Mining with Multiple Testing Correction). The key idea of DSPM-MTC is to integrate the multiple hypothesis testing correction procedure into the pattern mining process to generate a pattern set with error rate control. To demonstrate the effectiveness of DSPM-MTC, we conduct a series of experiments on real sequential data sets and simulation data sets. The experimental results show that DSPM-MTC can effectively recognize false discoveries to generate a pattern set with statistical quality control. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The correct selection of knowledge elements is the key to emergency management. Using emergency knowledge elements, this study constructs an assertive reasoning selection methodology by improving acquisition on the balance coefficient in the C4.5 algorithm. Through hierarchical representation, a two level model selection method, based on a top model construction process as well as an underlying model selection process, is proposed. Specifically, the top model construction process is based on assertive reasoning and an underlying model selection process is based on the C4.5 decision tree. This method reduces the requirements for emergency domain knowledge, and improves the accuracy and timeliness. Lastly, the methodology is applied to the 2015 Tianjin explosions as a case study.

ID ARRHYTHMIA DETECTION; COMPONENTS; IMPACT
AB The early detection of abnormal heart rhythm has become crucial due to the spike in the rate of deaths caused by cardiovascular diseases. While many existing works tried to classify heartbeats accurately, they suffered from the imbalance between heartbeat classes in the available ECG datasets since abnormal heartbeats appear much less frequently than normal ones. In addition, most of existing methods heavily rely on data preprocessing such as noise removal and feature extraction, which is computationally expensive, thus limits their use on low-cost portable ECG devices.
   We present a novel deep convolutional neural network based on state-of-the-art deep learning techniques for accurate heartbeat classification. We suggest a batch-weighted loss function to better quantify the loss in order to overcome the imbalance between classes. The loss weights dynamically change as the distribution of classes in each batch changes. Also, we propose to use multiple heartbeats for more effective heartbeat classification.
   Even though we use ECG signal from one lead only without any data preprocessing, our method consistently outperforms existing methods of 5-class heartbeat classification. Our accuracy, positive productivity, sensitivity and specificity under intra-patient paradigm are 99.48%, 98.83%, 96.97% and 99.87%, and those under inter-patient paradigm are 88.34%, 48.25%, 90.90% and 88.51% respectively.

AB A large number of spatio-temporal trajectory data is being generated from GPS enabled devices such as cars, smartphones, and sensors. These trajectory datasets representing objects' movements provide new opportunities for enhanced spatio-temporal periodic pattern mining. These GPS collected trajectory datasets represent real-world movement phenomena and thus they are spatially placed, temporally recorded, aspatial semantically meaningful, hierarchically structured, and irregularly sampled. Periodic pattern mining from spatio-temporal trajectories is to find temporal regularities from these spatio-temporal trajectories, and thus must take into these five characterisics into account in order not to miss any spatio-temporally, semantically and hierarchically meaningful patterns from irregularly sampled spatio-temporal trajectories. Traditional periodic pattern mining fails to consider these five conditions simultaneously, and in this paper, we propose a hierarchical clustering based semantic periodic pattern mining to consider the five aspects: spatiality, temporality, semantics, hierarchy, and irregularity. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method against traditional periodic pattern mining approaches. Crown Copyright (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) is a widely used non-destructive method in buried object detection. However, online, automatic, and accurate location and depth estimation methods using GPR are still under development. In this article, a cutting-edge expert system is proposed that compares signals from newly scanned locations to a target-free accumulated reference signal and computes a dissimilarity measure using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). By setting a threshold on DTW values and monitoring them online, a significant deviation of the DTW values from the reference signal is detected prior to reaching an object. A potential burial site is therefore automatically detected without having a complete GPR scan which is a huge advantage compared to existing methods. Following the scanning process and investigating the potential burial site, location and depth of multiple buried objects is estimated automatically and highly accurate. The fully-automated analytics eliminate the need of expert operators in estimating spatial burial locations and perform accurately even on noisy media. Statistical proofs are provided that support the validity of the developed expert system in theory. Moreover, the analytics run in real-time that is plausible for on-site applications.

AB It is well known that Minimum Feedback Arc Set is in a general case NP-complete. There are different kinds of exact, heuristic and approximation algorithms for solving this problem, but currently there is only one published Monte Carlo algorithm which solves Minimum Feedback Arc Set in polynomial time with arbitrary probability. To further advance the state of the art we have devised new and improved ant inspired Monte Carlo algorithm which on average has 20% faster empirical running time. Due to a learning mechanism the new algorithm also achieved 511% faster convergence in terms of median and 158% improvement in terms of arithmetic mean. This has been done while at the same time maintaining the ability of the algorithm to find optimal solution with arbitrary probability. In addition, the new and improved ant inspired algorithm has substantially improved convergence consistency. A tighter probability bound has also been calculated for the Monte Carlo algorithm. The aforementioned contributions have their significance in a design and implementation of expert and intelligent system. Considering a wide presence of MFAS in a variety of areas the obtained results are significant in other applications as well. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents and compares new metaheuristics to solve an integrated jobs-maintenance scheduling problem, on a single machine subjected to aging and failures. The problem, introduced by Zammori et al. (2014), was originally solved using the Modified Harmony Search (MHS) metaheuristic. However, an extensive numerical analysis brought to light some structural limits of the MHS, as the analysis revealed that the MHS is outperformed by the simpler Simulated Annealing by Ishibuchi et al. (1995). Aiming to solve the problem in a more effective way, we integrated the MHS with local minima escaping procedures and we also developed a new Cuckoo Search metaheuristic, based on an innovative Levy Flight. A thorough comparison confirmed the superiority of the newly developed Cuckoo Search, which is capable to find better solutions in a smaller amount of time. This an important result, both for academics and practitioners, since the integrated job-maintenance scheduling problem has a high operational relevance, but it is known to be extremely hard to be solved, especially in a reasonable amount of time. Also, the developed Cuckoo Search has been designed in an extremely flexible way and it can be easily readapted and applied to a wide range of combinatorial problems. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The timetabling problem involves the scheduling of a set of entities (e.g., lectures, exams, vehicles, or people) to a set of resources in a limited number of time slots, while satisfying a set of constraints. In this paper, a new variant of the simulated annealing (SA) algorithm, named FastSA, is proposed for solving the examination timetabling problem. In the FastSA's acceptance criterion, each exam selected for scheduling is only moved (and the associated move is evaluated) if that exam had any accepted moves in the immediately preceding temperature bin. Ten temperature bins were formed, ensuring that an equal number of evaluations is performed by the FastSA, in each bin. It was observed empirically that if an exam had zero accepted movements in the preceding temperature bin, it is likely to have few or zero accepted movements in the future, as it is becoming crystallised. Hence, the moves of all exams that are fixed along the way are not evaluated no more, yielding a lower number of evaluations compared to the reference algorithm, the standard SA. A saturation degree-based heuristic, coupled with Conflict-Based Statistics in order to avoid any exam assignment looping effect, is used to construct the initial solution. The proposed FastSA and the standard SA approaches were tested on the 2nd International Timetabling Competition (ITC 2007) benchmark set. Compared to the SA, the FastSA uses 17% less evaluations, on average, and a maximum of 41% less evaluations on one instance. In terms of solution cost, the FastSA is competitive with the SA algorithm attaining the best average fitness value in four out of twelve instances, while requiring less time to execute. In terms of average comparison with the state-of-the-art approaches, the FastSA improves on one out of twelve instances, and ranks third among the five best algorithms.
   The article's main impact comprises the points: (i) proposal of a new algorithm (FastSA) which is able to attain a reduced computation time (and number of evaluations computed) compared to the standard SA, (ii) demonstration of the FastSA capabilities on a NP-Complete timetabling problem, (iii) comparison with state-of-the-art approaches where the FastSA is able to improve the best known result on a benchmark instance. Due to the variety of problems solved by expert and intelligent systems using SA-based algorithms, we believe that the proposed approach will open new research paths with the creation of new algorithms that explore the space in a more efficient way.

ID CLASSIFICATION; RECOGNITION
AB Although done nearly effortlessly by humans, digital systems cannot easily recognize images or predictions from recent observations. Tackling these limitations by proposing novel algorithms to improve the performance of image processing would have widespread implications in a variety of fields, including robotics, manufacturing, biomedicine, and automation. To provide a computer with this combined ability and transform it into an intelligent system, an algorithm must combine memory with an image decomposition procedure. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are algorithms that aim to solve tasks such as classification, clustering, pattern recognition, and prediction by resembling brain connections. Specifically, three ANNs have excelled in specific areas: deep neural networks (DNNs), which use intrinsic connections to create prediction maps; long short-term memory neural networks (LSTMs), which use recurrent connections to emulate a type of memory; and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which can decompose complex data through layers for simpler analysis. Although these algorithms can solve certain tasks of image sequence prediction, they cannot easily solve entire problems on their own. Nevertheless, combining these networks may enable solving such problems with ease. Thus, this article evaluates the combination of ANNs into two novel algorithms developed with the aim of improving image sequence prediction: (i) a combination of CNNs and LSTMs to form a CLNN and (ii) a combination of CNNs, LSTMs, and DNNs to form a CLDNN. Although the developed algorithms require a longer training time, they require less training epochs to have better accuracy than their predecessors. Furthermore, both developed methods were capable of accurately performing the image sequence prediction task, outperforming each individual method, as well as predicting longer and greater numbers of sequences correctly. Overall, the developed algorithms were able to better decompose inputs, remember previous inputs, and more accurately predict sequences of images. This allows the prediction of the next step in the sequence, which can be used as part of an intelligent system to make an analysis and an informed decision on the next course of action.

AB Pattern representation affects classification performance. Although discovering "universal" features that work for many classification problems is ideal, most representations are problem specific. In this paper, we improve the classification performance of a classifier system by transforming a one-dimensional input descriptor into a two-dimensional space so that effective texture extractors can be extracted to capture hidden data information. We develop two new methods for matrix representation where features are extracted that are more generalizable. The first method for generating a two-dimensional representation of patterns is based on trees, the objective being to reshape the feature vector into a matrix, and the second method performs mathematical operations to build a matrix representation. The proposed framework is then evaluated for its specific power on three medical problems. To evaluate generalizability, we compare the proposed approaches with several other baseline methods across some well-known benchmark datasets that reflect a diversity of classification problems. Not only does our approach show high robustness, but it also exhibits low sensitivity to parameters. When different approaches for transforming a vector into a matrix are combined with several texture descriptors, the resulting system often works well without requiring any ad-hoc optimization. The performance of the tested systems is compared by Wilcoxon signed rank test and Friedman's test. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Urban mobility efficiency is of utmost importance in big cities. Taxi vehicles are key elements in daily traffic activity. The advance of ICT and geo-positioning systems has given rise to new opportunities for improving the efficiency of taxi fleets in terms of waiting times of passengers, cost and time for drivers, traffic density, CO2 emissions, etc., by using more informed, intelligent dispatching. Still, the explicit spatial and temporal components, as well as the scale and, in particular, the dynamicity of the problem of pairing passengers and taxis in big towns, render traditional approaches for solving standard assignment problem useless for this purpose, and call for intelligent approximation strategies based on domain specific heuristics. Furthermore, taxi drivers are often autonomous actors and may not agree to participate in assignments that, though globally efficient, may not be sufficently beneficial for them individually. This paper presents a new heuristic algorithm for taxi assignment to customers that considers taxi reassignments if this may lead to globally better solutions. In addition, as such new assignments may reduce the expected revenues of individual drivers, we propose an economic compensation scheme to make individually rational drivers agree to proposed modifications in their assigned clients. We carried out a set of experiments, where several commonly used assignment strategies are compared to three different instantiations of our heuristic algorithm. The results indicate that our proposal has the potential to reduce customer waiting times in fleets of autonomous taxis, while being also beneficial from an economic point of view.

AB Decision Trees (DTs) are a machine learning technique widely used for regression and classification purposes. Conventionally, the decision boundaries of Decision Trees are orthogonal to the features under consideration. A well-known limitation of this is that the algorithm may fail to find optimal partitions, or in some cases any partitions at all, depending on the underlying distribution of the data. To remedy this limitation, several modifications have been proposed that allow for oblique decision boundaries. The objective of this paper is to propose a new strategy for generating flexible decision boundaries by means of interactive basis functions (IBFs). We show how oblique decision boundaries can be obtained as a particular case of IBFs, and in addition how non-linear decision boundaries can be induced. One attractive aspect of the strategy proposed in this paper is that training Decision Trees with IBFs does not require custom software, since the functions can be precalculated for use in any existing implementation of the algorithm. Since the underlying mechanisms remain unchanged there is no substantial computational overhead compared to conventional trees. Furthermore, this also means that IBFs can be used in any extensions of the Decision Tree algorithm, such as evolutionary trees, boosting, and bagging. We conduct a benchmarking exercise to understand under which conditions the use of IBFs can improve model the performance. In addition, we present three empirical applications that illustrate the approach in classification and regression. As part of discussing the empirical applications, we introduce a device called decision charts to facilitate the interpretation of DTs with IBFs. Finally, we conclude the paper by outlining some directions for future research. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Most research into automatic emotion recognition is focused on facial expressions or physiological signals, while the exploitation of body postures has scarcely been explored, although they can be useful for emotion detection. This paper first explores a mechanism for self-reporting body postures with a novel easy to-use mobile application called EmoPose. The app detects emotional states from self-reported poses, classifying them into the six basic emotions proposed by Ekman and a neutral state. The poses identified by Schindler et al. have been used as a reference and the nearest neighbor algorithm used for the classification of poses. Finally, the accuracy in detecting emotions has been assessed by means of poses reported by a sample of users. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID RECOGNITION; VISION
AB Iris recognition is now developed enough to recognize a person from a distance. The process of iris segmentation plays a vital role in maintaining the accuracy of the iris-based recognition systems by limiting the errors at the current stage. However, its performance is affected by non-ideal situations created by environmental light noise and user non-cooperation. The existing local feature-based segmentation methods are unable to find the true iris boundary in these non-ideal situations, and the error created at the segmentation stage traverses to all the subsequent stages, which results in reduced accuracy and reliability. In addition, it is necessary to segment the true iris boundary without the extra cost of denoising as preprocessing. To overcome these challenging issues during iris segmentation, a deep learning-based fully residual encoder-decoder network (FRED-Net) is proposed to determine the true iris region with the flow of high-frequency information from the preceding layers via residual skip connection.
   The main four impacts and significances of this study are as follows. First, FRED-Net is an end-to-end semantic segmentation network that does not use conventional image processing schemes, and does not have a preprocessing overhead. It is a standalone network in which eyelid, eyelash, and glint detections are not required to obtain the true iris boundary. Second, the proposed FRED-Net is the final resultant structure of a step-by-step development, and in each step, a new complete variant network is created for semantic segmentation considering the detailed descriptions of the networks. Third, FRED-Net uses the residual connectivity between convolutional layers by the residual shortcut for both encoder and decoder, which enables a high-frequency component to flow through the network and achieve higher accuracy with few layers. Fourth, the performance of the proposed FRED-Net is tested with five different iris datasets under visible and NIR light environments, and two general road scene segmentation datasets. To achieve fair comparisons with other studies, our trained FRED-Net models, along with the algorithms, are made publicly available through our website (Dongguk FRED-Net Model with Algorithm. accessed on 16 May 2018).
   The experiments include two datasets: Noisy Iris Challenge Evaluation- Part II (NICE-II) selected from the UBIRIS.v2 database and Mobile Iris Challenge Evaluation (MICHE-1), for the visible light environment and three datasets: Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA) v4.0 interval, v4.0 distance, and IIT Delhi v1.0, for the near-infrared (NIR) light environment. Moreover, to evaluate the performance of the proposed network in general segmentation, experiments with two famous road scene segmentation datasets: Cambridge-driving Labeled Video Database (CamVid) and Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago (KITTI), are included. The experimental results showed the optimum performance of the proposed FRED-Net on the above-mentioned seven datasets of iris and general road scene segmentation. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB We propose a novel DEA method for computing efficiency scores. The method is based on a robust optimization viewpoint: the higher scores for those decision making units (DMU's) that remain efficient even for larger simultaneous and independent variations of all data and vice versa. Moreover, the value of each score itself gives the distance to inefficiency (or the distance to efficiency for inefficient units), so it provides a decision maker with an additional useful information on how stable the DMU is. The efficiency scores can be computed by solving generalized linear fractional programming problems, but we also present a tight linear programming approximation that preserves the order of rankings. We show many remarkable properties of our approach: It preserves the order of rankings compared to the classical approach, and it is unit invariant. It is naturally normalized, so it can be used for computing universal scores of DMU's of unrelated models. It gives scores not only for inefficient, but also for efficient decision making units. It can also be easily extended to generalized or alternative models, for instance to deal with interval data. We present several examples confirming the desirable properties of the method.

AB A vast number of multicriteria decision making methods have been developed to deal with the problem of ranking a set of alternatives evaluated in a multicriteria fashion. Very often, these methods assume that the evaluation among criteria is statistically independent. However, in actual problems, the observed data may comprise dependent criteria, which, among other problems, may result in biased rankings. In order to deal with this issue, we propose a novel approach whose aim is to estimate, from the observed data, a set of independent latent criteria, which can be seen as an alternative representation of the original decision matrix. A central element of our approach is to formulate the decision problem as a blind source separation problem, which allows us to apply independent component analysis techniques to estimate the latent criteria. Moreover, we consider TOPSIS-based approaches to obtain the ranking of alternatives from the latent criteria. Results in both synthetic and actual data attest the relevance of the proposed approach.

AB On electronic commerce websites, the recommender is typically based on a global evaluation of the product by the customer. This preference information is interesting, but not sufficient. Our approach is based on the assumption of the inevitable role of emotions in product appreciation. Our purpose is to evaluate the performance of the approach based on emotions and to compare it with the traditional approach of unique preference. The first step is to collect data. In the first part of the study, we simulate a database of customer/product/evaluation to test our method and to study the influence of matrix sparsity. The second part of the study is applied to real data. The product considered to illustrate the approach is film, a product for which preferences are mostly guided by emotions. We collect the data via an online questionnaire, given a sparse matrix of evaluation (people have not seen all the films). A use case, which consist in making spontaneous recommendations to customers on the basis of their previous ratings, is described. Considering that the behavior of a customer is not random, the notion of user profiles in terms of preference and emotions is introduced. The proposed recommender is tested by removing preference data and predicting it based on the rest of the database. A performance criterion is calculated, measuring the relevance of the proposed products. The results show that (1) the matrix sparsity does not have a significant influence on the results and robustness of our method and (2) consideration of customers' emotional assessments of products improves recommendation performance.

AB This paper describes a specific knowledge-based system (KBS) to assist designers in configuring numerical design of experiments (NDoE) processes efficiently. NDoE processes are applied in product design to improve the quality of product, by taking into account variabilities and uncertainties. NDoE processes are defined by various and complex methodologies to achieve several objectives, as optimization, surrogate modeling or sensitivity analysis. On the other hand, NDoE processes may demand huge computing resources to execute hundreds simulations, and also advanced expert knowledge to set the best configuration amongst numerous possibilities. Designers aim to obtain most useful results with a minimal computational cost as soon as possible. Thus, the configuration step must be as fast as possible, and it must lead to an efficient combination of complex methods, algorithms and hyper-parameters, to obtain valuable information on the product. The proposed KBS and its inference engine, a bayesian network, is detailed and applied to a product developed by automotive industry. The KBS propose new efficient configurations to achieve designers' goal. This application shorten the configuration step of the NDoE process, and enables designers to use more complex methods. It also allows designers to capitalize knowledge and learn from each past NDoE process. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The problem of missing values in the process of data acquisition is becoming critical due to both hardware failure and human error. Radial Basis Function based interpolation and missing value prediction in the dependent variable through surface fitting has been the viable solution from a long time. However, the solution works well on the idea of building one equation of 'N' weight variables corresponding to each sampled data point from a set of 'N' samples. Still, because of the inherent computations, it demands big primary memory when 'N' becomes large. Hence, on a memory-restricted setup, sometimes it suffers from the memory overflow problem. In this paper, we propose a novel data decomposition based RBF enabled surface fitting approach by building and aggregating multiple small models in an overlapping manner, which works well even with smaller primary memory with minimal impact on loss of generality. We also consider two hyperparameters as window size and overlapping index in order to tune bias-variance tradeoff. The proposed approach is applied to ten real-world datasets having multiple dimensions and results are found competitive while comparing with single trained model and Kernel Ridge Regression. Therefore, we believe this approach will rejuvenate the RBF based surface fitting method in attaining better performance in the Big data world too. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB As the demand increases for the use Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to monitor natural disasters, protecting territories, spraying, vigilance in urban areas, etc., detecting safe landing zones becomes a new area that has gained interest. This paper presents an intelligent system for detecting regions to navigate a UAV when it requires an emergency landing due to technical causes. The proposed system explores the fact that safe regions in images have flat surfaces, which are extracted using the Gabor Transform. This results in images of different orientations. The proposed system then performs histogram operations on different Gabor-oriented images to select pixels that contribute to the highest peak, as Candidate Pixels (CP), for the respective Gabor-oriented images. Next, to group candidate pixels as one region, we explore Markov Chain Codes (MCCs), which estimate the probability of pixels being classified as candidates with neighboring pixels. This process results in Candidate Regions (CRs) detection. For each image of the respective Gabor orientation, including CRs, the proposed system finds a candidate region that has the highest area and considers it as a reference. We then estimate the degree of similarity between the reference CR with corresponding CRs in the respective Gabor-oriented images using a Chi square distance measure. Furthermore, the proposed system chooses the CR which gives the highest similarity to the reference CR to fuse with that reference, which results in the establishment of safe landing zones for the UAV. Experimental results on images from different situations for safe landing detection show that the proposed system outperforms the existing systems. Furthermore, experimental results on relative success rates for different emergency conditions of UAVs show that the proposed intelligent system is effective and useful compared to the existing UAV safe landing systems.

AB This paper introduces a place-matching pattern mining approach that detects place-matching patterns from raw spatio-temporal GPS trajectories using real-world places from OpenStreetMap. The approach begins by annotating raw trajectory recordings as either stopping or moving. It then groups contiguously stopping entries into so-called stop episodes; each of which is then associated with a number of potential stop place candidates from the real-world place repository OpenStreetMap. As each stop episode may have multiple place candidates, the proposed approach uses a Hidden Markov Model to probabilistically match each sequence of stop episodes to its most likely sequence of visited real-world places. The result of this stop episode formulation and place-matching is that the original trajectories are transformed into a discrete, greatly simplified, and more semantically meaningful sequence of place visitations. This format enables the last step of our approach where frequent itemsets and sequential patterns are extracted using traditional approaches. Experimental results with real and synthetic datasets demonstrate our approach's running time performance, robustness to GPS noise, dataset compression, and matching accuracy. Additionally, a case study using human trajectories from the real-world Geolife dataset reveals many interesting and seemingly real patterns. These findings suggest the general validity and applicability of our approach as a place-matching trajectory data mining approach. Crown Copyright (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Strategy literature has mainly focused on conceptual tools to support stages of the planning and structuring of the strategy within the context of a Balanced Scorecard (BSC). Recently, quantitative tools based on multi-criteria decision-making methods (MCDM) have received more attention; however, studies still have limitations. Such is the case of Fuzzy DEMATEL, which has been proposed in the literature, but not integrated within the whole process of strategy formulation. In addition, studies have presented weaknesses by not considering, for instance, the logical structure of a strategy map.
   Hence, the main objective of this study is to propose the development of a method that supports the overall process of planning, structuring and validating a business unit strategy while overcoming the limitations of previous works, considering the subjectivity of decision-making in the construction of strategy maps. To fulfil these purposes, this study proposes an extension of the work of Lopez-Ospina et al. (2017) entitled "A method for designing strategy maps using DEMATEL and linear programming", by integrating fuzzy logic and traditional, conceptual and qualitative tools to support the diagnosis and strategy design. The significant contributions of this work is that it overcomes limitations of previous methods by providing: (1) a logic structure of strategy maps; (2) integration of subjectivity within the overall formulation process of the strategy; (3) selection of the most important relationships between strategy objectives to explain efficiently, functionally, and easily the route map of a strategy; and (4) integration of traditional qualitative tools with quantitative tools, making the process robust and holistic. The proposed method was applied to an Official Banking business unit of a Colombian bank, where expert judgment for strategy formulation helps to test the effect of the methodological design.

AB The industry dynamic creates a difficult problem that must be solved if we are to address climate change. How can we lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions while simultaneously increasing production? This paper develops a new inverse data envelopment analysis (DEA) model for optimizing GHG emissions. The inverse DEA model minimizes the overall GHG emissions generated by a set of decision making units (DMUs) for producing a certain level of outputs, given that the DMUs maintain at least their existing performance status. The usefulness of the proposed method in this paper is demonstrated through an application in the oil and gas industry. We find that roughly 57% of our sample DMUs are inefficient. Ample room exists within the current efficiency frontier to lower GHG emissions in the oil and gas sector. We recommend that environmental regulators look into targeting regulations at these inefficiencies that exist within the industry as low bearing fruit for potential GHG emissions reductions.

   Programming; Q-learning; Deep learning
AB In this work, we identify two related problems that arise in many Wireless Sensor Networks defense mechanisms: the problem of ad-hoc defense and the problem of optimality. These problems open the door to attacks that could severely affect the performance of defense mechanisms. In this work, we use Markov Decision Processes as framework to model an attacker that is able to exploit these two problems. This allows us to model a defense mechanism theoretically and to obtain the performance of an attack against it, as well as to obtain the optimal attack against the defense mechanism- i.e., the attack that harms the most the defense mechanism. We also make use of Deep Reinforcement Learning tools, showing that they can be used by an intelligent attacker to successfully exploit a possibly unknown defense mechanism, providing a compromise between attack results and computational cost. We test our approach by thoroughly studying a Cooperative Spectrum Sensing attack, which we use to illustrate the framework proposed and to highlight their strengths and weaknesses.

AB Experts in industrial processes rely on domain knowledge (DK) repositories to identify the causes of abnormal situations in order to make appropriate decisions that mitigate the negative effects of such events. These DK repositories need to be enriched and updated continuously as different unexpected events occur. A common causality analysis method in DK repositories is the fault tree analysis (FTA). The major limitation of updating a fault tree is that it requires in-depth system knowledge, which involves a high level of human experience. Data exploitation based on machine learning (ML) can address this limitation by deeply analyzing process historical data to discover hidden phenomena that are difficult for human experts to identify and to analyze. This paper proposes an innovative methodology that combines domain knowledge, in the form of FTA, with additional knowledge extracted by a descriptive ML method called logical analysis of data (LAD). More specifically, LAD is a classification method, which provides as a by-product a set of interpretable rules (patterns) explaining the classification results. The patterns extracted from historical data represent an important and complementary source of knowledge that provides experts with insights and allows them to better understand the process operations. The objective of using these patterns in the proposed methodology is to provide automatic enrichment and updating of existing fault trees in order to achieve accurate fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) in industrial processes. The proposed methodology is demonstrated using fault trees constructed for two different systems in the process industry. The fault tree for each system was updated successfully with minimal effort from process experts. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Colorimetric nanosensors formed of polydiacetylene (PDA), triblock copolymer (L64 or F68), and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), so-called nanoblends, were developed to detect enrofloxacin (ENRO) in aqueous media. The nanosensors show hydrodynamic diameter ranging from 234.2 +/- 3.5 to 801.6 +/- 17.8 nm for SDS concentrations of 13.0-21.0 mM, respectively. The lowest limit of detection was 0.054 mu M, which is five times smaller than the maximum limit allowed by the European Union. The response surfaces showed that both the SDS and ENRO concentrations influenced the colorimetric response (p < 0.05), and kinetic rate of colorimetric transition (R-CT). SDS concentration between 11.0 and 14.0 mM in the nanoblend yielded the most sensitive nanosensors for detecting ENRO. When L64 was replaced by F68, the colorimetric response of the nanoblends was similar, but PDA/F68/SDS showed a slower R-CT than PDA/L64/SDS. The developed nanosensor is a sensitive and simple device for the fast detection of ENRO.

AB The increased emergence of Ciguatera Fish Poisoning in the Canary Islands and Madeira demanded the development of confirmatory methods by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry to characterize the risk. Efforts were particularly focused on the optimization of sample pretreatment, especially in the sample cleanup step, to efficiently remove matrix interferences as a critical factor to consider in mass spectrometry detection. Two different LC-MS/MS approaches have been used for confirmation purposes, the first one using the sodium adduct as precursor and product ion to allow an increased sensitivity in the detection, whereas additional fragments were also monitored for further confirmation. The optimized conditions above mentioned allowed the confirmation of Caribbean Ciguatoxin-1 as the main responsible for the samples analyzed from these geographical areas, while the presence of a new hydroxyl metabolite of C-CTX1 was also confirmed in one sample analyzed in this study.

AB A novel colorimetric sensor has been proposed for sensitive and accurate detection of iodine forms using polymethacrylate matrix, which also has the outlook for use with samples without pre-treatment and is suitable to fit in a portable instrument for in situ iodine analysis. This determination method is based on interaction of polymethacrylate matrix with iodine forms followed by measurement of absorbance at 370 nm. The principle of this colorimetric sensor is not ordinary colorimetry, but a new colorimetric strategy that combines solid phase extraction and spectrophotometric determination of a target substance following completion of the color change processes. This method ensures determination of 0.05-80.0 mu g.g(-1) of iodine with the detection limit of 0.02 mu g.g(-1). The testing results show that this polymethacrylate matrix can be used for determination of iodine in solutions, food grade salt and iodinated mineral water.

AB To monitor the abuse of antibacterial synergists, a hapten, trimethoprim carboxylic derivative (TMPCOOH), was designed by using molecular modelling technology. A broad-spectrum monoclonal antibody (mAb) TMP/2G1 was prepared, for which the IC50 values of trimethoprim, diaveridine, aditoprim, baquiloprim, ormetoprim, and brodimoprim were 0.232, 0.527, 1.479, 4.354, 0.965, and 0.119 mu g L-1, respectively. Based on the broad spectrum mAb, an indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ic-ELISA) was developed to determine the residues of antibacterial synergists. The limit of detection regarding the developed ic-ELISA for antibacterial synergists ranged from 0.025 to 1.126 mu g L-1 in milk, honey and edible animal tissues. The recoveries ranged from 81.4% to 107.7%, with a coefficient of variation less than 20%. A good correlation (R-2 = 0.994) between the ic-ELISA and HPLC-MS/MS showed the reliability of the developed ic-ELISA.

AB 1-Phenylethanol is a chiral flavor compound that has enantiomers, (R)- and (S)-1-phenylethanol, with different flavor properties. Given that isolating these enantiomers from plants is low yielding and costly, enzymatic synthesis presents an alternative approach. However, the genes/enzymes that specifically produce (R)- and (S)-1-phenylethanol in plants are unknown. To identify these enzymes in tea (Camellia sinensis) flowers, 21 short chain dehydrogenase (SDR) genes were isolated from tea flowers, cloned, and functionally characterized. Several recombinant SDRs in Escherichia coli exhibited activity for converting acetophenone to (S)-1-phenylethanol (CsSPESs, > 99.0%), while only one SDR produced (R)-1-phenylethanol (CsRPES, 98.6%). A pair of homologue enzymes (CsSPES and CsRPES) showed a strong preference for NADPH cofactor, with optimal enzymatic reaction conditions of 45-55 degrees C and pH 8.0. Identification of the tea flower-derived gene responsible for specific synthesis of (R)- and (S)-1-phenylethanolsuggests enzymatic synthesis of enantiopure 1-phenylethanol is possible using a plant-derived gene.

AB The objective of the present study was to investigate the influences of dietary lipid composition on the gastrointestinal digestion and postprandial serum lipid profiles, and the connections between them. The in-vitro digestion results showed that maximum free fatty acid (FFA) release level of different lipid samples was PO (Palm oil) > RO (Rapeseed oil) > LINO (Linseed oil) > SO (Sunflower oil) > LO (Lard oil), and the first-order kinetics apparent rate constant was PO > SO approximate to RO > LO approximate to LINO, this may probably be ascribed to their specific lipid fatty acid composition and TAG structure. The individual FFA released during 240 min in-vitro digestion time was measured, and it showed that the release rate of short-chain saturated fatty acids (e.g. C16:0 in PO) were higher than the long-chain poly-unsaturated fatty acids (e.g. C18:3n-3 in LINO). Besides, the position of fatty acids within TAG molecules could also impose influences on the lipid hydrolysis process upon pancreas lipase in gastrointestinal tract using in-vitro digestion model. The postprandial serum fatty acid composition of the adult SD male rats were examined within 240 min after oral gavage administration, and the Pearson correlations between lipid fatty acid composition and the serum fatty acid profiles were analyzed. Certain correlations were summarized between lipid compositions (i.e. fatty acid composition and TAG structure), lipid digestion fates and serum fatty acid content in postprandial. The present work may provide some basic understandings of the connections among lipid compositions, lipid gastrointestinal digestion differences and the postprandial serum lipid profiles, and provide useful information about their nutritional and functional evaluation.

AB In the present study, an improving method for extracting carotenoids in aquatic animals using ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) was developed. The theoretical optimum extraction condition (ultrasonic power, temperature and time of 246.77 W, 37.64 degrees C and 29.03 min, respectively) based on the maximum extracted total carotenoids content (TCC) (141.13 mu g/g) was predicted by single-factor experiments and response surface methodology. Additional experiments were then carried out under practical extraction conditions to verify the predicted value for TCC. The optimum practical extraction condition was at ultrasonic power, extraction temperature and extraction time of 240 W, 38 degrees C and 29 min, respectively, where the TCC (137.88 +/- 1.22 mu g/g) similar to the predicted value. On the other hand, a much lower total carotenoid of 107.75 +/- 2.60 mu g/g was obtained by the 2 h conventional extraction of carotenoids (CEC). The UAE in carotenoids extraction has higher efficiency, shorter processing time, and less acetone than the CEC.

AB The aim of this study was to characterize the influence of starch-protein interactions on physicochemical properties and starch digestibility in corn starch-whey protein isolate (WPI) blends during cooking. The results studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and dynamic viscoelasticity revealed that the swelling process of starch granule was restricted by protein. While recrystallization after cold storage was accelerated by protein addition. The short-range structure in Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) favored by protein was in negative correlation to the rapidly digestible starch content. Studies on rheological properties showed that the interaction force was mainly through hydrogen bonds. Additionally, confocal laser scanning microscopy analysis indicated that whey protein formed a surrounding or encapsulation of starch granules and acted as a physical barrier toward starch digestibility following cooking.

Washing caused a significant loss in vitamin B, PA, and mineral contents, whereas, soaking only decreased the thiamine content. Moreover, cooking decreased the vitamin B and PA contents, and high-pressure cooking exerted more remarkable effects than those of ordinary and microwave cooking. Furthermore, washing and soaking increased the Zn and Ca bioaccessibilities, however, cooking improved the bioaccessibilities of Mg, Fe, and Ca, but decrease those of Zn and Mn. Therefore, vitamin and mineral losses caused by excessive washing should be given attention. Cooking processes in relatively low temperature may also be beneficial to the nutritive properties of vitamins and minerals.

AB This study investigated the encapsulation of curcumin into egg white protein (EWP) nanoparticles. Processing conditions used to formulate the nanoparticles, including pH and the addition of ethanol, were used to control the unfolding and aggregation behavior of EWP. The curcumin loading capacity of the EWP nanoparticles was found to be strongly linked to the structural transitions of the protein during heat denaturation, and the microscopic properties of the particles such as particle size and zeta-potential. Fibrous particles were formed at lower pH (3.0) and were associated with a higher curcumin loading than the granular particles formed at pH 3.8. Ethanol leads to an increase in beta-sheet structure, and the formation of a coarser gel structure during heat denaturation, resulted in an increase in particle diameter. The highest curcumin loading capacities were 11.53 and 9.89 mg/g protein (with a final curcumin concentration of 312.5 mu M and 268 mu M respectively), at pH 3.0 and 3.8, respectively.

AB Large-leaf yellow tea (LYT) imparting unique toasty flavor is a traditional beverage in China. The volatile composition of LYT after full fire processing (FF-YT) was determined by different extraction methods. Steam distillation (SD), solid-phase microextraction (SPME) and headspace (HS) were applied for analysis of tea body notes, tea infusion and dry tea aroma, respectively. A total of 143 volatile compounds was identified by the three methods, of which SD-FF-YT, SPME-FF-YT, and HS-FF-YT extracts contained 100, 72, and 56 volatiles, respectively. Heterocyclics and aromatic compounds were the main volatile composition of LYT and might be contributors to its crispy-rice-like odor. L-Theanine was demonstrated to contribute to the formation of tea volatiles. N-Ethylacetamide, formed in the L-theanine only model thermal reaction, was probably involved in the LYT volatile formation. The current results provide new insight into L-theanine on aroma formation, although the detailed formation mechanism remains largely unknown.

AB In this study, volatile component changes of germinated chickpea, lentil, and yellow pea flours over the course of 6 days germination were characterized by HS-SPME-GC-MS/O. In total, 124 volatile components were identified involving 19 odor active components being recorded by GC-O exclusively. Principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) revealed that lentil and yellow pea flours had the similar aromatic attributes, while the decrease of beany flavor compounds along with the occurrence of unpleasant flavors was detected in chickpea flours upon germination. Six beany flavor markers, including hexanal, (E,E)-2,4-nonadienal, (E,E)-2,4-decadienal, 3-methyl-1-butanol, 1-hexanol, and 2-pentyl-furan, were employed to quantify beany flavor formation in the flours over the course of germination. The results suggested that no significant beany flavor formation or mitigation was appeared after 1 day of germination. The findings are crucial for tailing pulse germination process to enhance the macronutrients without increasing undesirable beany flavor.

AB A fast sample preparation procedure based on use of infrared (IR) assisted heating for mineralization of soybean derived samples has been developed for their subsequent multielement analysis by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) and flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS). A cold finger was examined for refluxing of acid vapors to determine its impact on efficiency and economy of digestion. The optimized procedure, based on 1 g subsamples, 8 mL of HNO3 (65% w/w) and exposure of the mixture to a 500 W IR source for 5 min without refluxing, permitted accurate determination of all analyzes in NIST SRM 1568b (rice flour). Detection limits using ICP-OES were (mu g/kg) 97, 1.0, 39, 185, 0.47 and 1200 for Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Mn and P, respectively, and 18 for Zn by FAAS. The IR-assisted digestion approach provided a low cost, easy to use system having great potential for implementation in routine analysis of trace elements in soybean and similar matrices.

AB In this study, a molecularly imprinted polymer capable of recognizing 8 benzimidazoles was first synthesized. The computation simulation showed that the shape and size of used template were the main factors influencing its recognition ability. Then the polymer was used as recognition reagent to prepare a chemiluminescence sensor on conventional 96-well microplate. The sample solution and a HRP-labeled hapten were added into the microplate wells to perform competitive binding, and the light signal was initiated with 4-(imidazol-1-yl)phenol enhanced luminol-H2O2 system. The optimized sensor was used to determine the residues of 8 benzimidazoles in mutton and beef. Result showed that the sensor achieved ultrahigh sensitivity (limits of detection of 1.5-21 pg/mL), rapid assay process (18 min) and satisfactory recovery (65.8%-91.2%). Furthermore, this sensor could be reused for 4 times. Therefore, this sensor could be used as a rapid, simple, sensitive and durable tool for screening the residual benzimidazoles in meat.

AB With the purpose of valuing the species Chenopodium quinoa Willd (quinoa), as well as encouraging the consumption of its grains, this study aimed at providing a detailed evaluation of the nutritional value and chemical composition of several quinoa grains of different colour varieties (black, red and white) from different origins. The results demonstrated an excellent composition, namely in the presence of many compounds of interest, such as organic acids, tocopherols and unsaturated fatty acids, as well as a very favourable nutritional profile, with carbohydrates and proteins being the prominent macronutrients. Regarding the different varieties, statistical analysis showed that there were no significant differences in studied parameters, with the exception of proteins, carbohydrates, oxalic acid, gamma-tocopherol and total tocopherols content. Thus, this pseudocereal takes a position of nutritional excellence, compared to others cereals more commonly consumed, thereby representing a promising ingredient for many uses in the food industry.

AB In this paper a new aptasensor with high-sensitivity, and high-specificity for detection of diazinon, was discovered, based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between quantum dot (QD) as a donor and graphene oxide (GO) as an acceptor. L-cysteine capped CdS QDs/DF20 aptamer bioconjugates were successfully synthesized. GO was also attached to aptamers and photoluminescence quenching was obtained through FRET. By adding target diazinon to the bioconjugates containing GO, photoluminescence recovery was detected due to detachment of GO from the aptamer as a result of the difference in affinity for the aptamer. The detection limit of the biosensor was 0.13 nM and the linearity was maintained from 1.05 to 206 nM. Other pesticides and herbicides did not contribute to photoluminescence recovery due to lack of binding affinity for the aptamers, which demonstrates the selectivity of the biosensor. The results show the applicability of the aptasensor for monitoring diazinon in environmental and agricultural samples.

AB Seven types of wheat and rye flours were studied regarding their physical and chemical properties, as well as the presence of mycotoxins and microorganisms. The results revealed that flours presented moisture and ash contents below the recommended maximum limit. They also presented a low lipid content, which helps avoiding changes in the flours' smell and taste. From the microbiological analysis, comparing the refined rye and wheat flours, the counting in the analysed microorganisms was not significantly different. The whole flours presented high contents in almost all the tested microorganisms, highlighting the molds counting for the whole wheat flour and the aerobic plate counting for the whole rye flour. None of the samples presented Salmonella spp. Aflatoxins and ochratoxin A were not detected in any of the flours. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first characterization of wheat and rye flours for Portuguese consumers.

AB This study investigated the chain conformation, microstructure, and rheological properties of a quaternary ammonium salt of curdlan (Qcurd) in aqueous medium. Results showed that Qcurd exhibited typical polyelectrolyte behavior in pure water, and the normal viscosity character was observed in 0.1 M NaCl aqueous solution. The weight-average molecular weight (M-w), z-average radius of gyration (R-d), hydrodynamic radius (R-h), conformational parameter (alpha), characteristic constant (alpha) and structure parameter (rho) for Qcurd were determined as 8.08 x 10(4) g/mol, 26.7 nm, 15.0 nm, 0.54, 0.62, and 1.78, respectively, indicating that Qcurd existed as a flexible chain conformation in 0.1 M NaCl solution, verified by atomic force microscopy. Qcurd exhibited more pronounced shear-thinning behavior at higher concentrations. The flow behavior of Qcurd at different concentrations and temperature was well evaluated by power-law model and Arrhenius equation. Dynamic tests revealed that Qcurd showed oscillatory behaviors between a dilute solution and a weak elastic gel.

AB Aimed to rapidly identify the edible oils according to their botanical origin, a novel method was proposed using supervised support vector machine based on low-field nuclear magnetic resonance and relaxation features. The low-field (LF) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signals of 11 types of edible oils were acquired, and 5 features were extracted from the transverse relaxation decay curves and modeled using support vector machines (SVM) for the identification of edible oils. Two SVM classification strategies have been applied and discussed. Good performance can be achieved when the relative position of each edible oil has been determined by PCA before the designing of binary tree structure of SVM model, and the classification accuracy is 99.04%. The good robustness of this method has been verify at different data sets. It is almost a real time method, and the entire process takes only 144 s.

AB Encapsulation of polar and non-polar bioactive compounds from bilberries was achieved by designing microcapsules with bilberry seed oil (BSO) distributed in an aqueous phase of anthocyanins (AC) stabilized by whey protein isolate (WPI). Non-thermal emulsification method (o/w/o) was developed and the effect of pH (3 or 4.5), concentration of WPI (8.4-10.8% w/w), addition of AC (72-216 ppm) and emulsifier on the structure-forming kinetics, resulting microstructure during storage and after centrifugation and washing was investigated. Agglomeration of BSO was observed in all microcapsules at pH 4.5 due to slow gelling process and in samples at pH 3 at low concentrations of WPI (<= 8.4%). Capsules with pH 3 (9.6-10.8% WPI) had weak structures but as the gelling process was faster, it generated an even distribution of BSO droplets. All samples at pH 4.5 and samples with WPI concentration >= 10.8% at pH 3 exhibited intact structures after centrifugation and washing.

AB The aim of the present study was to enhance oxidative stability and bioaccessibility of beta-conglycinin (7S) prepared from low denatured defatted soybean flours with residual lipids and high lipoxygenase (LOX) activity. The model system consisting of linoleic acid (LA), LOX and unheated 7S (UH-7S)/heated 7S (H-7S) or UH-7S-catechin/H-7S-catechin complex, and in vitro gastrointestinal (GI) digestion model were used to investigate the effect of complexation with catechin on protein oxidation and characterisation of GI digest. The interaction of UH-7S/H-7S with catechin dramatically inhibited LOX-catalyzed LA peroxidation-induced protein oxidation. The interaction also promoted the degree of proteolysis in GI digestion and intestinal absorption for oxidized UH-7S/H-7S, increasing the antioxidant activity of oxidized UH-7S/H-7S, bioaccessibility for catechin and release of di-/tripeptides with dipeptidyl peptidase-IV/angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitory effects or antioxidant activities during GI digestion. The complexation with catechin is a potential strategy to enhance the oxidative stability, GI digestibility and bioaccessibility of 7S.

AB Utilization of marine algae has increased considerably over the past decades, since biodiversity within brown, red and green marine algae offers possibilities of finding a variety of bioactive compounds. Marine algae are rich sources of dietary fibre. The remarkable positive effects of seaweed dietary fibre on human body are related to their prebiotic activity over the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) microbiota. However, dietary modulation of microorganisms present in GIT can be influenced by different factors such as type and source of the dietary fibre, their molecular weight, type of extraction and purification methods employed, composition and modification of polysaccharide and oligosaccharide. This review will demonstrate evidence that polysaccharides and oligosaccharides from marine algae can be used as prebiotics, emphasizing their use in human health, their application as food and other possible applications. Furthermore, an important approach of microbial enzymes employment during extraction, modification or production of those prebiotics is highlighted.

AB Wild blueberry pomace extract complexed with wheat or chickpea flour or soy protein isolate produced spray dried and freeze-dried polyphenol-protein particles. To evaluate the impact of spray drying on the biological activity of these food ingredients in vitro antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, regulation of glucose metabolism and ability to stimulate fibroblast migration were tested. Extracts from polyphenol-protein particles significantly decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and down-regulated the gene expression of inflammation markers (COX-2 and IL-beta). Milder suppression of nitric oxide production and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) gene expression was evident. The extracts significantly inhibited phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and accelerated fibroblast cell migration up to 3-fold after 24 h. Complexed polyphenols retained their structural integrity and bioactive potency for both lyophilized and spray dried treatments. The data suggests that spray drying is a convenient and cost-effective technique to produce blueberry-polyphenol food ingredients with preserved phytochemicals with biological activities.

AB In this work, a novel simple, fast, selective and inexpensive fluorescence method for the determination of curcumin based on the fluorescence quenching of nitrogen and chlorine dual-doped carbon nanodots (N,CI-CDs) was for the first time presented. The N,CI-CDs were fastly and greenly produced by simply mixing glucose, 1,2-ethylenediamine (EDA) and hydrochloric acid (HCl). The fluorescence of N,Cl-CDs was significantly quenched by curcumin via a synergistic effect of dynamic quenching and inner filter effect (IFE). The N,Cl-CDs shows high selectivity and sensitivity towards curcumin sensing, achieving a linear range of 0.1-35 mu M and a limit of detection (LOD) as low as 38 nM. The proposed fluorescence method was successfully utilized for curcumin detection in food samples with recoveries in a range of 96.8-106.1%. The findings of this study suggest the feasibility and usefulness of N,CI-CDs as an effective fluorescence probe for the determination of curcumin in complex food matrix.

AB Phosphorylation regulates protein structure, function, cell signaling and enzyme activities within cells. Postmortem changes of muscle to meat are partially determined by the structure, function and enzyme activities of proteins. To further understand the mechanisms regulating postmortem changes, ovine muscles with different glycolytic rates were subjected to quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis. Totally 116 unique phosphopeptides matched to 99 phosphoproteins were detected to be different in abundance among the fast, moderate and slow glycolytic rate muscles. Of which, 24 phosphoproteins clustered into glycolysis and muscle contraction were selected after bioinformatics analysis. Quantitative analysis showed that phosphorylation of pyruvate kinase, phosphoglucomutase 1, enolase and fructose-bisphosphate aldolase was correlated with glycolytic rate early postmortem. In addition, some myofibrillar proteins were detected to be differentially phosphorylated. In summary, this study revealed that protein phosphorylation at early postmortem may indirectly affect the glycolysis pathway through the regulation of proteins involved in glycolysis and muscle contraction.

AB The hypothesis is that the characteristics of ingested protein gels influences the subsequent in vivo gastric digestion process. Three egg white gels (EWGs) of identical composition but differing in structure and texture were prepared and fed to pigs. Sampling throughout a 6h postprandial period, and at different locations in the stomach of the pigs, enabled a detailed spatial-temporal mapping of the pH, dry matter content, particle size and rheological properties. The results showed different gastric acidification kinetics implying an effect of the gel structure and/or texture. The most elastic and cohesive gel resulted in the highest median particle size and the most viscoelastic chyme. Distal and proximal regions of the stomach did not differ in terms of dry matter content, particle size distribution or rheological properties. These results demonstrate the consequences of protein food structure on gastric chyme properties, and thus suggest an effect on the digestion process.

AB In this work, a method has been applied and validated for the determination of a group of 35 multiclass pesticides in the minor tropical fruits rose apple/pomarrosa (Syzygium malaccense), starfruit/carambola (Averrhoa carambola), yoyomo (Spondias purpurea) and papayuela (Vasconcellea pubescens) cultivated and exported in Colombia. The AOAC 2007.1 QuEChERS method, that uses an acetic acid/acetate buffer, was applied together with gas chromatography coupled to a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. The method was validated in terms of calibration, recovery at three levels of concentration and matrix effects (MEs). A mixture of analyze protectants was also used. A good linearity was obtained in all cases, while the study of the ME revealed the need of developing matrix-matched calibration for many pesticides. Recovery values were in the range 70-120% with relative standard deviation values less than 20% for most of the pesticides studied. The lowest calibration level was 5 mu g/kg. Several samples of each type were analysed.

AB Cocoa has been widely discussed as a bioactive food rich in sensory stimulation and health benefits. However, no information has been provided concerning phytoprostanes (PhytoPs) and phytofurans (PhytoFs) in cocoa. These compounds are of interest because they play a role in the regulation of immune function. The present study included 31 cocoa clones. The PhytoPs and PhytoFs were quantified by UHPLC-QqQ-MS/MS. The total PhytoPs and PhytoFs contents ranged from 221.46 to 1589.83 ng g(-1) and from 1.18 to 13.13 ng g(-1), respectively. The profiles of the PhytoPs and PhytoFs identified in the cocoa beans showed significant differences among the clones analysed. The results indicate that dry fermented cocoa beans are rich in PhytoPs and PhytoFs, which may represent an additional benefit of the consumption of foods derived from cocoa.

AB Heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAAs) are defined as a major class of poisonous compounds formed from proteinaceous foods during heat processing and flavour-forming. These toxicants have detrimental effects on the human body and eventually bring about mutagenicity and carcinogenicity. Owing to the presence of HAAs at a marginal level in the intricate tissue of food and their interactivity, an effective sample preparation should be employed to extract these controversial chemicals from the food matrix. For separation and detection of HAAs, advanced extraction methods and instrumental techniques have been applied. According to the type of sample preparation, sensitivity of the experiment, laboratory conditions and available facilities, the choice of analytical equipment will be different. In this review, various cooked food samples containing HAAs and heat processing of them have been listed. Also, sample pre-treatment and analytical techniques that have been applied to determine HAAs are discussed.

AB This study reports on the preparation of riboflavin-loaded whey protein isolate (WPI) microparticles, using desolvation and then spray drying. Ethanol desolvation led to the exposure of embedded hydrophobic amino acids of WPI to riboflavin, facilitating the formation of riboflavin-WPI complexes. The extent of desolvation and cross-linking influenced the morphology of the spray-dried microparticles, while the moisture content of microparticles decreased with desolvation and increased with crosslinking. The modification of WPI conformation upon desolvation could be retained in the dry state via spray drying. The gastric resistance, release site and release characteristics of microparticles were readily adjusted by varying the ethanol and calcium ion contents from 0 to 50% v/v and from 0 to 2 mM, respectively. The sample prepared from 30% v/v ethanol without calcium crosslinking displayed rapid peptic digestion in less than 30 min. The samples from 30% v/v ethanol at 1 and 2 mM Ca2+ exhibited excellent gastric resistance and intestinal release.

AB To get a thorough understanding of evolution of heat-induced gel in meat batters, water distribution, protein conformation and their chemical bonds at phase transition temperatures (20-74 degrees C) were investigated by Low-field NMR and FT-IR. Firstly, G' increased and tan delta decreased beyond 55 degrees C, when sol was completely changed into an elastic gel. Then water holding capacity (WHC) decreased along with decreasing relaxation time T-22 and a new relaxation time T-23 appeared at 50 degrees C, which indicated that partially immobilised water was converted into free water outside. Meanwhile, surface hydrophobicity increased significantly and free sulfhydryl contents decreased, which contributed to the formation of disulfide bonds, especially beyond 55 degrees C. Finally, the transformation of alpha-helix into beta-sheets occurred, and increasing beta-sheets are necessary for the formation of elastic gels. Moreover, there was a significant correlation between alpha-helical contents and water loss, surface hydrophobicity, sulfhydryl contents.

AB The effect of roasting, high-pressure homogenization HPH and thermal treatment on peanut milk and its oil bodies OBs was evaluated. Full-fat peanut milk samples were obtained using aqueous extraction method followed by HPH 150 or 300 MPs and pasteurization or sterilization. Roasting has a pronounced effect on the appearance, functional properties and the OBs protein membrane of peanut milk. The HPH significantly affected the microstructure, particle size, theology and the color of raw and roasted peanut milk. Where, the size was significantly reduced, consistency index (k) decreased and the flow behavior index (n) increased with the increase in homogenization pressure. However, the raw peanut milk samples became more sensitive to sterilization. On the other hand, the roasted peanut milk samples subjected to homogenization were particularly stable to sterilization. Further, a combination of roasting, HPH and thermal treatment can provide a stable product with better flavor and without additives.

AB The determination of carcinogenic 4(5)-methylimidazole (4-MeI) in complex matrices at trace levels is a challenge because of its higher polarity and weaker column retention capability. Here, we proposed a novel method for the quantification of 4-MeI in various foods and beverages using modified quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe (QuEChERS) extraction with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. The evaluated QuEChERS extraction with LC-MS/MS method showed excellent linearly (1-200 mu g/L, with correlation coefficient (R-2) > 0.999), trueness (91-113%), and precision (relative standard deviation (RSD) <= 12.3%), but low matrix effect (92-108%) for cola, tea, beer, coffee beverage, bread, biscuit and instant coffee. The expanded measurement uncertainty was less than 34.4% at 95% confidence level. The proposed method can be successfully applied to determine 4-MeI in 28 commercial foods and beverages purchased from local market. Therefore, we believe this method is likely to provide a potential for 4-MeI determination in practical application.

AB As a major sterol in edible mushroom, ergosterol has gained much attention owing to its potential bioactivities. However, ergosterol has a high melting point, poor oil solubility and stability, which restrict its scope of application. In this study, an ergosterol ester of alpha-linolenic acid was successfully and efficiently prepared using Candida sp. 99-125 lipase as a biocatalyst. The desired product was confirmed to be ergosterol linolenate using MS, FT-IR, and NMR analyses. Using Candida sp. 99-125 lipase, the product conversion exceeded 92% in 12 h under the following optimized parameters: 75 mmol/L ergosterol, 40 g/L lipase, 1:1.25 ergosterol-to-alpha-linolenic acid molar ratio, and 45 degrees C. The results confirmed that Candida sp. 99-125 lipase has good reusability and stability and is also relatively low cost, suggesting its great potential for large-scale production of ergosterol ester. Most importantly, the physiochemical properties (oil solubility and melting point) of ergosterol significantly improved after esterification with alpha-linolenic acid, thus facilitating its application in oil-based systems.

AB In this study, the effect of washing, soaking (1, 5 and 12 h), and cooking rice methods including Rinsed (boiling in excess water) and Kateh (conventional) cooking on the reduction of the arsenic (As), lead (Pb), and cadmium (Cd) were evaluated. The results showed that the rinsed cooking has higher efficiency for removal of toxic metals (As = 42.3%, Pb = 42.9% and = 27.6%) than Kateh method (As = 26.9%, Pb = 26.9% and = 20.9%). Additionally, by increasing of rice soaking time from 1 to 12 h, the toxic metals removal was increased up to 37.1%, 42.6% and 16.6% for As, Pb and Cd, respectively. Although the toxic metals reduction was such that the non-carcinogenic risk was regarded as acceptable level after all processes, for arsenic, these reductions did not lower the carcinogenic risk to an acceptable level. Finally, it is suggested that Tehran households, after washing and soaking to 5 h, then cook it by rinse method.

AB The research was done to analyze the seven different Traditional rice cultivars for their several functional structural and sensory properties. These cultivars were found to score highest as compared to hybrids rice varieties grown in the same regions in terms of sensory and other functional attributes. The moisture, protein, ash, fibre and carbohydrate content varied from 10.84% to 13.18%, 7.25-8.85%, 0.57-1.57%, 0.74-1.67% and 74.76-78.24%. Maximum Paste stability was depicted by these cultivars. The hardness of the rice gels were found to correlate positively with the fat content of their respective cultivars. The gelatinization enthalpy that indicates loss of double helical structure was found highest in Mushki budgi (9.73Jg(-1)). The granules with pentagonal structure were displayed by Mushki kandi with 3.70-6.74 mu m length range. The X-ray diffraction patterns of the rice cultivars depicted A-type XRD pattern. The pigmented cultivars retained pigments upon cooking justified their health benefits in terms of antioxidants. The significance of this research is to analyse the cumulative effects of composition, granule morphology and crystalline pattern of rice cultivars on their several functional characteristics.

AB The interaction of strawberry cell wall with hydroxytyrosol (HT) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol (DHPG), two potent phenolic antioxidants naturally found in olive fruit with important biological properties, was investigated. The interaction occurred with drying and seemed to be more complex, strong and irreversible than a simple association. MALDI TOF-TOF analysis suggested covalent (ester bond) and non-covalent (strong hydrogen-bonding, mostly) interactions. The oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assay confirmed that the phenols maintained partially their antioxidant activity after binding to the soluble dietary fraction. This soluble dietary fiber was obtained following digestion simulated in vitro with gastric and intestinal fluids. Although the antioxidant activity of HT and DHPG was affected by the dietary fiber interaction, this activity was restored when polysaccharide size was reduced by enzymatic treatment, suggesting that a similar process could occur in the colon. Thus, the use of this novel antioxidant-enriched soluble dietary fiber as a functional food ingredient could potentially promote intestinal health.

AB Chemometric analysis of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) data was applied to investigate the possibility to rapidly authenticate European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax L.) according to production method (wild or farmed), rearing system (extensive, semi-intensive or intensive), and geographical origin (Western, Central or Eastern Mediterranean Sea). NIR spectra from 1100 to 2500 nm were subjected to an exploratory principal component analysis (PCA) followed by orthogonal partial last square-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) to develop classifiers able to distinguish samples according to the various conditions under study. Models provided a correct classification rate of 100% for both wild and farmed sea bass, and of 67%, 80%, 100% for extensively, semi-intensively, and intensively-reared subjects, respectively. As for geographical provenance, 100% of Eastern, 88% of Central and 85% of Western Mediterranean Sea samples were correctly discriminated. The successful results obtained confirmed suitability of chemometric analysis applied to NIRS data for fast authentication of European sea bass origin.

AB Since late '80 s Avian metapneumovirus subtype A causes sufficient disease in Europe for commercial companies to have started developing live attenuated vaccines. Here, two of those vaccines were fully consensus sequenced alongside their progenitor field strain (#8544). Sequences comparison shows that the attenuation of field strain #8544 was associated with no common substitutions between the two derived vaccines. This finding suggests that the attenuation of field viruses via serial passage on cell cultures or tissues is the result of a random process, rather than a mechanism aiming to achieve a specific sequence. Furthermore, field vaccination strategies would greatly benefit by the unambiguous vaccine markers identified in this study, enabling a prompt and confident vaccines detection. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Introduction: Invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) is uncommon but still causes considerable public health burden due to its high mortality and morbidity. This review aims to quantitatively synthesise all published evidence pertinent to mortality caused by IMD and assess the effect of age and serogroup on case fatality rates (CFRs).
   Methods: The PubMed and Embase databases, and the Cochrane Library were searched. Articles reporting national CFRs and published in English between January 2000 and May 2018 were eligible. The studies reporting mortality resulting from a specific symptom of IMD (e.g. meningococcal meningitis) were excluded. Mixed-effects logistic regression with a restricted cubic spline was used to analyse CFRs as a function of age. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed to estimate an overall CFR and CFRs by serogroup.
   Results: Among 48 eligible studies reporting national CFRs, 40 studies were included in meta-analyses representing 163,758 IMD patients. CFRs ranged from 4.1% to 20.0% with the pooled overall CFR of 8.3% (95% confidence interval (CI): 7.5-9.1%). Serogroup B was associated with a lower pooled CFR (6.9% (95%Cl: 6.0-7.8%)) than other serogroups (W: 12.8% (95%Cl: 10.7-15.0%); C: 12.0% (95%Cl: 10.5-13.5%); Y: 10.8% (95%Cl: 8.2-13.4%)). The meta-analysis was not performed for serogroup A (MenA) cases due to a small number of MenA patients who were enrolled in eligible studies. For laboratory confirmed IMD cases, the predicted CFR was 9.0% in infants, gradually decreased to 7.0% in 7-year olds, subsequently increased to 15.0% in young adults aged 28 years, stabilised between 15 and 20% in mid-aged adults and reached a high in elderly people.
   Conclusions: Our findings can provide useful information for better understanding the mortality risks, and quantifying the burden associated with IMD mortality. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Recent efforts to develop a live attenuated vaccine against Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (Map), the causative agent of Johne's disease (JD), revealed relA is important in Map virulence. Deletion of the relA gene impairs the ability of Map to establish a persistent infection. Analysis of the basis for this observation revealed infection with a relA deletion mutant (Delta relA) elicits development of cytotoxic CD8 T cells (CTL) with the ability to kill intracellular bacteria. Further analysis of the recall response elicited by Delta relA vaccination showed a 35 kDa membrane peptide (MMP) is one of the targets of the immune response, suggesting it might be possible to develop a peptide-based vaccine based on MMP. To explore this possibility, ex vivo vaccination studies were conducted with MMP alone and incorporated into a nanoparticle (NP) vector comprised of poly (D, L-lactide-co-glycolide) and monophosphoryl lipid A (PLGA/MPLA). As reported, ex vivo vaccination studies showed CD8 CTL were elicited with classic and monocyte derived dendritic cells (cDC and MoDC) pulsed with MMP alone and incorporated into a PGLA/MPLA vector. Incorporation of MMP into a NP vector enhanced the ability of CD8 CTL to kill intracellular bacteria. The findings indicate incorporation of MMP into a PGLAIMPLA nanoparticle vector is one of the possible ways to develop a MMP based vaccine for Johne's disease. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: The introduction of rotavirus vaccines into national immunization programs necessitates vaccine effectiveness evaluations. Parental report of vaccination status is a simple and accessible source of information; however, its validity is unclear.
   Aims: To validate parental reports of rotavirus immunization compared to documentation of vaccination in national immunization registry, and to assess vaccine effectiveness by each method.
   Methods: Parents of 1272 children aged 2-59 months from northern Israel hospitalized for gastroenteritis in 2011-2015 were interviewed on the sociodemographics and rotavirus vaccination status of their child. Rotavirus immunization status based on parental report was compared to that documented in the national immunization registry, which was considered the gold standard. Stool samples collected from patients were tested for rotavirus antigen by immunochromotgraphy. In a rotavirus test-negative case-control study, vaccination history was compared between children found positive for rotavirus and those who tested negative. Vaccine effectiveness for >= 1 dose vs. zero doses was calculated as: (1-adjusted odds ratio)* 100.
   Results: The sensitivity and specificity of parental report of their child's immunization with a rotavirus vaccine were 97% (95% CI 96-98), and 75% (95% CI 65-82), respectively. Kappa coefficient was 0.69 (p < 0.001) for the agreement between the two methods. Rotavirus vaccine effectiveness was 72% (95% CI 54-84) when using parental report of rotavirus immunization and 79% (95% CI 62-88) when using the registry.
   Conclusion: Parental report of their child's immunization with a rotavirus vaccine demonstrated high sensitivity, although the specificity was relatively low. Vaccine effectiveness was similar regardless of method used to determine rotavirus immunization status. Parental report of vaccination status can be useful in vaccine effectiveness assessment.

AB Background: While herd effects and serotype replacement by childhood pneumococcal protein conjugated vaccines (PCVs) continues to accumulate worldwide, direct effectiveness of 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) against pneumococcal diseases in the elderly has been challenged. We estimated the direct effectiveness of PPV23 in the elderly population.
   Methods: For a hospital-based case-control study, cases of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) and non-bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia (NBPP) (adults >= 65 years) were identified in 14 hospitals participated in the pneumococcal surveillance program from March 2013 to October 2015, following implementation of PPV23 national immunization program (NIP) for the elderly in the Republic of Korea. Controls matched by age, sex, and hospital were selected at ratios of 1:2 (IPD) or 1:1 (NBPP). Clinical data and vaccination records were collected. Vaccine effectiveness was calculated as (1-adjusted odds ratio) x 100.
   Results: We enrolled 148 IPD and 557 NBPP cases, and 295 IPD and 557 NBPP controls for analyses. Overall effectiveness of PPV23 against IPD was 28.5% [95% confidence interval (CI) -5.8%-51.6%] and against NBPP was 10.2% (-15.1-30.6) in all patients >= 65 years. However, in subgroup analysis of patients aged 65-74 years, PPV23 was protective against IPD [effectiveness 57.4% (19.4-77.5)] and against NBPP [effectiveness 35.0% (2.3-56.7)]. Furthermore, serotype-specific effectiveness of PPV23 against IPD was 90.6% (27.6-98.8) for PPV23-unique serotypes and 81.3% (38.6-94.3) for PPV23 serotypes excluding serotype 3.
   Conclusions: This study indicates that PPV23 with broad serotype coverage might be beneficial in preventing IPD and NBPP due to non-PCV13 serotypes in the young-elderly, with potentially increasing effectiveness in the setting of childhood PCV NIP. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Human rhinovirus (RV) infections are the principle cause of common colds and precipitate asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations. Currently there is no vaccine for RV which is largely due to the existence of similar to 160 serotypes/strains. We demonstrated previously that immunising mice with highly conserved VP4 and VP2 regions of the RV polyprotein (RV-A16 VP0) generated cross-reactive immunity to RV in vivo. The current study investigated and mapped the epitopes of RV-A16 VP0 that are targets for antibodies in serum samples from VP0 immunisation and RV challenge studies in mice. Recombinant capsid proteins, peptide pools and individual peptides spanning the immunogen sequence (RV-Al 6 VP0) were assessed for IgG binding sites to identify epitopes. We found that peptide pools covering the C-terminus of VP4, the N-terminus of VP2 and the neutralising Nlm-II site within VP2 were bound by serum IgG from immunised mice. The Nlm-II site peptide pool blocked IgG binding to the immunogen RV-A16 VP0 and individual peptides within the pool binding IgG were further mapped. Thus, we have identified immunodominant epitopes of RV vaccine candidate RV-A16 VP0, noting that strong IgG binding antibodies were observed that target a key neutralising epitope that is highly variable amongst RV serotypes.

AB Background: Vaccinations in pregnancy are recommended for the potential benefits of preventing severe pertussis disease in newborns and for preventing the impact of influenza on the pregnant woman, her foetus in utero and, the newborn in the first six months of life. Published data in Australia suggested that coverage rates were sub-optimal so the reasons for this were reviewed.
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey of 1014 postnatal women, aged 18 years and older, who had given birth in the previous six months was undertaken on the Gold Coast in Queensland, Australia. Participants completed a brief questionnaire on provided smart tablets at public vaccination clinics or with a researcher by phone or via an on-line link.
   Results: Just over 85% of survey respondents received a pertussis booster with many of those not receiving vaccine having had it in a recent pregnancy. Only 36.7% of respondents had an influenza vaccine in pregnancy with key barriers being belief in influenza vaccine, seasonality of parturition and a lack of recommendation from the attending obstetric carers.
   Discussion: While maternal pertussis vaccine programs are a success, work needs to be done to improve the public perception of the risk benefit equation surrounding influenza vaccine in general, and particularly its use in pregnancy. Research is required into approaches to altering practitioner attitudes as well as how to alter public perceptions. (C) 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Introduction: The Global Vaccine Action Plan identifies workforce capacity building as a key strategy to achieve strong immunization programs. The Strengthening Technical Assistance for Routine Immunization Training (START) approach aimed to utilize practical training methods to build capacity of district and health center staff to implement routine immunization (RI) planning and monitoring activities, as well as build supportive supervision skills of district staff.
   Methods: First implemented in Uganda, the START approach was executed by trained external consultants who used existing tools, resources, and experiences to mentor district-level counterparts and, with them, conducted on-the-job training and mentorship of health center staff over several site visits. Implementation was routinely monitored using daily activity reports, pre and post surveys of resources and systems at districts and health centers and interviews with START consultants.
   Results: From July 2013 through December 2014 three START teams of four consultants per team, worked 6 months each across 50 districts in Uganda including the five divisions of Kampala district (45% of all districts). They conducted on-the-job training in 444 selected under-performing health centers, with a median of two visits to each (range 1-7, IQR: 1-3). More than half of these visits were conducted in collaboration with the district immunization officer, providing the opportunity for mentorship of district immunization officers. Changes in staff motivation and awareness of challenges; availability and completion of RI planning and monitoring tools and systems were observed. However, the START consultants felt that potential durability of these changes may be limited by contextual factors, including external accountability, availability of resources, and individual staff attitude.
   Conclusions: Mentoring and on-the-job training offer promising alternatives to traditional classroom training and audit-focused supervision for building health workforce capacity. Further evidence regarding comparative effectiveness of these strategies and durability of observed positive change is needed. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID ECONOMIC-EVALUATION; DECISION-MAKING; RECOMMENDATIONS
AB The UK Department of Health and Social Care recently held a consultation on proposals to revise the methods for the appraisal of cost-effectiveness of vaccines as applied by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). This presents a useful opportunity to review the current methods applied by the JCVI and examine the proposals for their improvement. Reviewing such methods is timely as there is mounting evidence that key elements of the health economic appraisal of all healthcare interventions in the UK need to be revised, In particular, there is a need to reassess both the cost-effectiveness threshold used to judge if an intervention is cost-effective and the discount rates used to assess the present value of health gains that occur in the future. Accordingly, we critically appraise the methods and their proposed changes. Overall, the 27 recommendations made within the recent consultation on proposed changes indicate a sensible and carefully considered approach to methods reform. We identify 11 recommendations that deserve further comment or reconsideration. In particular, there are reasons to question the basis for the proposed reduction of the discount rate from 3.5% to 1.5%. We also find that aspects of the current methods for considering uncertainty in the cost-effectiveness of vaccines require revision. Both the discounting and uncertainty analyses recommendations do not appear to be well grounded in economic theory, empirically justified or consistent with the methods set out by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence.

   Affordability
AB Despite the remarkable power of immunization reducing morbidity and mortality due to vaccine preventable diseases, one in five African children still does not receive all the basic, necessary vaccines. This is particularly true of the 10 middle-income countries (MICs) in the WHO African Region, where data demonstrates that immunization coverage is decreasing. These countries are not eligible for Gavi support in accessing new vaccines because of their relatively high per capita income level and will gradually increase with the transitioning of countries out of Gavi support. Thus, WHO was requested to facilitate access to affordable vaccines in relation to middle-income countries and those transitioning out of Gavi support in the near future. With commitment to address the issue, WHO Regional Office for Africa convened a consultative meeting from 09 to 11 April 2018 in Brazzaville, Congo to explore ways of improving access to affordable vaccines for MICs in the Region. The meeting brought together 17 low, middle and upper middle income countries in the African Region. Immunization partners and other WHO Regions also participated in the consultation to share experiences and explore ways of increasing access to affordable vaccines in MICs in the African Region. At the end of the meeting a number of solutions and action points were proposed for implementation in the Region. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

   events; Social contract
ID PROGRAM
AB Background: To prevent the spread of infectious diseases, governments have implemented a number of policies, including a range of mandatory vaccination policies. In addition, some governments have implemented no fault vaccine injury compensation schemes as a legal mechanism of recourse for individuals experiencing adverse events following vaccination. We aimed to identify countries with mandatory vaccination policies that also have no fault compensation schemes.
   Methods: To identify countries with mandatory childhood vaccination policies, we utilized existing publications, lists and databases, also conducting multiple country searches and policy detail verification. We then investigated compensation schemes for each country with childhood vaccination mandates, using an existing study and database/internet searches.
   Results: Of the 62 countries we identified with mandatory childhood vaccination policies, we found evidence that only 7 (11%) had also implemented no fault compensation schemes.
   Conclusions: No-fault compensation schemes are one government approach to address unintended consequences of vaccination. Few countries have implemented these schemes, including those with mandatory vaccination policies. Mandatory vaccination invokes a strong need to protect those who fall victim to extremely rare cases of provable no-fault vaccine injury. Countries that mandate childhood vaccination without providing no fault compensation schemes could be seen as abrogating the social contract. This is particularly important when public policies limit parental choice regarding whether to vaccinate. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Several outbreaks of Hepatitis A virus (HAV) were recently documented among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Europe. We investigated the HAV incidence among MSM in Amsterdam, the Netherlands; and HAV seroprevalence and HAV vaccination decision among MSM visiting the Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI) clinic in Amsterdam.
   Methods: Using surveillance data from 1992 to 2017 of MSM with acute HAV in Amsterdam, we estimated the incidence by calendar year and age. We explored HAV seroprevalence by calendar year and age, determinants for HAV seropositivity, and opting-in/out for HAV vaccination using data collected among MSM that visited the STI clinic between 2006 and 2017 and were included in a nationwide Hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination programme. Offering HAV vaccination at the STI clinic differed over three consecutive periods: not offered, offered for free, or offered for 75 euros. Logistic regression analyses were used to explore determinants.
   Results: HAV incidence increased in 2016/17 after 4 years of absence and peaked in MSM around 35 years of age. Among MSM visiting the STI clinic, HAV seroprevalence was 37% (95%CI = 35-40%), which was constant over the period 2006-2017, and increased with age (p < 0.001). Determinants for HAV seropositivity in multivariable analysis were: older age (p < 0.001), originating from an HAV endemic country (p < 0.001), and being HBV seropositive (p = 0.001). MSM opted-in more frequently when HAV vaccination was offered for free versus paid (89% versus 11%, respectively; p < 0.001). Younger MSM were less inclined to vaccinate when payment was required (p = 0.010). Post-hoc analyses showed that 98% versus 46% of MSM visiting the Amsterdam STI clinic would be protected against HAV infection if HAV vaccination was offered for free or for 75 euros, respectively.
   Conclusions: The MSM population of Amsterdam is vulnerable to a new HAV outbreak. We strongly recommend that MSM have access to free hepatitis A vaccination. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The overwhelming increase of dengue virus (DENV) infections in recent years shows that current strategies to combat dengue do not work. The lack of a highly effective dengue vaccine and the limited effectivity of vector controls exacerbate this situation. To point the way to a novel method of creating DENV vaccine candidates, here we disrupted the codon usage in a DENV-2 reporter replicon to generate variants with different replication characteristics. Six different mutated constructs containing stretches of altered codon usage in the non-structural genes were generated. The mutated sequences were deoptimized to the least favorable codons for human cells. We studied the replication efficiency of these constructs by measuring luciferase reporter activity, relative RNA fold change, and NS1 secretion. Our findings showed that the level of virus attenuation is closely associated with the amount of codon deoptimization. Indeed, replication was completely abolished in extensively-deoptimized constructs D2Rep-6 and D2Rep-5, intermediate with constructs D2Rep-4 (771 bp silent mutations) and D2Rep-3 (756 bp silent mutations) and restored almost to wildtype levels with constructs D2Rep-2 (394 silent mutations) and D2Rep-1 (48 silent mutations). We also determined that the position of codon deoptimization within the genome is crucial to the degree of attenuation observed. Based on our analysis, we propose that the design for an ideal DENV vaccine candidate could include 700-1500 silent mutations within the NS2A and NS3 genes.

AB Background: HPV-16 and HPV-18 cause most oropharyngeal cancers, which are increasing in incidence among males. Although HPV vaccines are highly effective against a number of HPV-associated cancers, efficacy for oropharyngeal cancers has not yet been demonstrated. In addition, the level of antibodies required for protection against oral HPV infection is unknown.
   Methods: 150 men ages 27-45 years from Tampa, FL, USA, and Cuernavaca, Mexico, received Gardasil at Day 1, Months 2, and 6. Then, sera and oral gargles were collected one month, 12 months, and 24 months after completion of the three doses (Month 7, 18 and 30 of the study) and tested for anti-HPV-16 and HPV-18 IgG antibody levels by a L1 VLP ELISA.
   Results: All participants developed detectable serum anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18 antibodies and most had detectable antibodies in oral gargles at Month 7 (HPV-16: 93.2%; HPV-18: 72.1%). By months 18 and 30, oral antibodies were detectable in a lower number of participants (HPV-16, 39.8% and 29.6%; HPV-18, 10.7% and 4.6% of individuals, respectively). Overall, oral HPV-16- and 18-specific antibody levels, normalized to total IgG at months 7, 18, and 30, correlated with serum levels (HPV-16, R-2= 0.93; HPV-18, R-2= 0.91).
   Conclusions: Reduced detectability of oral and serum HPV-16 and HPV-18 antibodies was observed at months 18 and 30 after initiation of the quadrivalent vaccination. However, when detectable, serum and oral HPV-16 and HPV-18 antibody levels were strongly correlated. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Although major reductions in maternal and child mortality were achieved in the Millennium Development Goals era, progress must be accelerated to meet Sustainable Development Goals health targets by 2030. An estimated 2.7 million neonatal deaths and 2.6 million stillbirths still occur annually. Over the past several years there has been renewed global interest in innovative approaches to maternal immunization to potentially decrease mortality and severe morbidity in neonates, and in the pregnant woman and her fetus. Several new vaccines are in clinical development for indications in pregnant women, e.g., vaccines against respiratory syncytial virus, and group B streptococcus. Achieving near-concurrent introduction of new maternal vaccines in high-, middle-, and low-income countries requires that mechanisms are in place for appropriate safety monitoring worldwide.
   The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation convened a global expert meeting in Amsterdam on May 1-2, 2018, to discuss a framework for appropriate pharmacovigilance for vaccines used during pregnancy based on integrated maternal interventions vigilance (MIV) systems and collection of appropriate data to inform timely decision-making by and for pregnant women. Planning for MIV requires a multidisciplinary, collaborative approach that fully leverages and builds upon existing resources, and builds new capabilities and capacity where needed. Meeting participants identified priority actions including (1) establishing background rates to better evaluate emerging safety signals and vaccine effectiveness, (2) identifying potential sentinel vaccine surveillance sites, (3) developing data sharing capabilities, (4) creating guidance documents and protocols, and (5) the advanced preparation of culturally-appropriate communication plans and risk management plans.
   Integrating MIV across the routine obstetric and neonatal health care delivery continuum and all relevant programs and data systems could result in fundamental improvements in maternal, neonatal and child health. Improved pregnancy pharmacovigilance platforms may strengthen other vaccine and drug product safety systems and improve maternal and child research capabilities in LMICs.

ID PROGRESS
AB We analyzed the time trends and spatial distribution of MMR vaccine coverage in Brazil during 2007-2017. In early 2018, a measles outbreak started in the North region of Brazil, reaching 11 of the 27 federal units by January 24, 2019. In this period, 10,302 cases were confirmed. Although the reintroduction of measles in Brazil is likely due to migration from Venezuela, the spread of the virus was made possible by the low levels of MMR coverage, as a result of significant decreases during the study period. Areas with high concentration of municipalities with low coverage are more susceptible to the spread of the virus, especially in the North and Northeast regions. Increasing vaccination coverage is essential to block the ongoing outbreak in Brazil. Vaccination strategies might target priority areas, especially those with a marked decrease in coverage. Moreover, it is essential to extend actions to travelers, migrants and refugees. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Bluetongue virus serotype -8 (BTV-8) epizootic in Germany (2006-2008) was successfully eradicated, essentially by the massive application of commercially available inactivated BTV-8 vaccines. While a six-year antibody longevity of BTV antibodies post BTV-8 vaccination in cattle has been described previously, our study investigated the BTV-8-vaccine antibodies in cattle for up to eight years. In total, 157 bovine serum samples were analysed for the presence of group-specific BTV antibodies in both a commercial cELISA, and a BTV-8- specific serum neutralization test. A robust number of cattle were seropositive for group- and serotype-specific neutralising antibodies for five or more years. In selected animals, born and vaccinated in 2009 or later, the presence of BTV antibodies for up to eight years post BTV-8 vaccination could be confirmed. Our data also show, that booster vaccination prolonged the antibody longevity of vaccine-induced antibodies and the number of serologically positive cattle. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Studies of vaccine-preventable disease (VPD) burden and immunisation coverage among migrants compared to locally-born populations present a mixed picture on whether migrants experience disproportionate VPD rates and immunisation inequities, and what the associated factors are. We conducted a scoping review to explore differences in VPD burden and immunisation coverage between migrants and non-migrants worldwide.
   Methods: We followed Arksey and O'Malley's five stage scoping review method. We searched for empirical, peer-reviewed literature published in English that compared VPD burden and/or immunisation coverage between migrant and non-migrant groups published between 2006 and 2016 using MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Sociological Abstracts, and Web of Science databases. Relevant information from the studies were charted in Microsoft Excel and results were summarised using a descriptive analytical method.
   Results: Forty-five studies met the inclusion criteria (n =13 reporting on VPD burden; n = 27 reporting on immunisation rates; n = 5 reporting on both). Studies that met the criteria only reported findings from high income countries or high-middle income countries. Accounting for results that were presented according to separate ethnic migrant sub-groups, almost all of the studies comparing VPD burden (n = 17, 89%) reported higher burden among migrants compared to non-migrants, while most studies measuring immunisation rates (n = 26, 70%) noted lower rates among migrants. Numerous factors contributed to these findings, including the influence of migrants' nativity, socio-economic status, migration background, generation status, residential duration, cultural/personal beliefs, language proficiency and healthcare utilisation.
   Conclusions: Considerable variability of study foci and methodologies limited our ability to make definitive conclusions and comparisons, but the literature suggests that migrant populations generally experience higher VPD burden and lower immunisation rates. The findings highlight a number of important considerations for future research and immunisation programme planning. Future research should explore factors that influence VPD burden and immunisation rates, and strategies to overcome barriers to vaccine uptake among migrants. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The Global Influenza Initiative (GII) is a global expert group that aims to raise acceptance and uptake of influenza vaccines globally and provides recommendations and strategies to address challenges at local, national, regional, and global levels. This article provides a consolidated estimation of disease burden in Latin America, currently lacking in published literature, and delivers the Gil recommendations specific to Latin America that provide guidance to combat existing vaccination challenges.
   While many countries worldwide, especially in the tropics and subtropics, do not have a seasonal influenza policy, 90% of Latin American countries have a seasonal influenza policy in place. Local governments in the Latin American countries and The Pan American Health Organization's Technical Advisory Group on Vaccine-preventable Diseases play a major role in improving the vaccination coverage and reducing the overall disease burden. Influenza seasonality poses the biggest challenge in deciding on optimal timing for vaccination in Latin America, as in temperate climates seasonal influenza activity peaks during the winter months (November-February and May-October) in the northern and southern hemispheres, respectively, while in the tropics and subtropical regions it usually occurs throughout the year, but especially during the rainy season. Besides this, vaccine mismatch with circulating strains, misconception concerning influenza vaccine effectiveness, and poor disease and vaccine awareness among the public are also key challenges that need to be overcome. Standardization of clinical case definitions is important across all Latin American countries. Surveillance (mostly passive) has improved substantially in the Latin American countries over the past decade, but more is still required to better understand the disease burden and help inform policies.

AB After decades of inconsequential infections, and sporadic outbreaks in the Asia-Pacific region between 2007 and 2013, Zika virus caused a widespread epidemic in South America in 2015 that was complicated by severe congenital infections. After the WHO declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in February 2016, vaccine development efforts based on different platforms were initiated. Several candidates have since been evaluated in clinical phase I studies. Of these, a Zika purified inactivated vaccine (ZPIV), adjuvanted with aluminum hydroxide, developed by the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR), yielded high seroconversion rates. Sanofi Pasteur further optimized the vaccine in terms of production scale, purification conditions and regulatory compliance, using its experience in flavivirus vaccine development. Here we report that the resulting optimized vaccine (ZPIV-SP) elicited robust seroneutralizing antibody responses and provided complete protection from homologous Zika virus strain challenge in immunocompetent BALB/c mice. ZPIV-SP also showed improved immunogenicity compared with the first-generation vaccine, and improved efficacy in the more permissive interferon receptor-deficient A129 mice. Finally, analysis of the IgG response directed towards nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) suggests that viral NS1 was efficiently removed during the optimized purification process of ZPIV-SP. Together, these results suggest that the optimized vaccine is well suited for further evaluation in larger animal models and late-stage clinical studies. (C) 2019 The Authors.

AB Background: The pediatric 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) was included in the pediatric immunization programme in Japan in late 2013. The impact of vaccination on the serotype distribution and clinical characteristics of pneumococcal pneumonia has not been described.
   Methods: The first phase of this multicentre prospective study was conducted at community-based hospitals in Japan from 2011 to 2014. The second phase was conducted from 2016 to 2017. Pneumococcal isolates and clinical data were collected from patients with community-acquired pneumonia who were >= 15 years of age. Patients were classified by pneumococcal serotype to PCV13 serotype, 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) non-PCV13 serotype, and non-vaccine serotype.
   Results: A total of 484 patients were enrolled, 241 in the first phase and 243 in the second. The proportion of PCV13 serotypes decreased from 53% to 33% (p < 0.001), whereas PPV23 non-PCV13 serotypes did not change (p = 0.754). PCV13 serotypes were associated with increased risk of elevated blood urea nitrogen (adjusted odds ratio 2.49; 95% confidence interval: 1.49-4.16) and hospitalization (adjusted odds ratio 1.74; 95% confidence interval: 1.02-2.95). These associations were not observed in patients with PPV23 non-PCV13 serotypes.
   Conclusions: The occurrence of pneumococcal pneumonia caused by vaccine-covered serotypes dramatically decreased following the introduction of pediatric PCV13. The PCV13 serotypes were associated with pneumonia severity. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Introduction: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of acute lower respiratory tract infections in infants. An investigational vaccine using an engineered recombinant RSV fusion glycoprotein in its post-fusion conformation (RSV F subunit vaccine) has been developed to protect young infants via maternal immunization. This first-in-human, phase I, observer-blind study (NCT02298179) evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of different dosages and formulations of RSV F subunit vaccine in healthy non-pregnant women and men aged 18-45 years.
   Methods: Participants were enrolled (1:1:1) in a stepwise dosage-escalation manner into three cohorts to receive RSV F subunit vaccine containing 45 mu g, 90 mu g and 135 mu g of RSV F glycoprotein. Within each cohort, participants were randomized (1:1:1:1) to receive two doses of RSV F subunit vaccine with (aluminum hydroxide or MF59) or without adjuvant, or placebo, >= 28 days apart. Safety (until day 365 post-dose 2), anti-RSV neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) and serum total binding antibodies to RSV F protein (until day 181 post-dose 1) were evaluated.
   Results: All formulations were well-tolerated. No vaccine-related serious adverse events were reported. All participants were seropositive for anti-RSV NAbs at baseline, with geometric mean titers (GMTs) ranging from 184 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 127-266) to 380 (95% CI: 272-531). At 28 days post-dose 1, anti-RSV NAb GMTs in vaccine recipients ranged from 893 (95% CI: 702-1,136) to 1,602 (95% CI: 1,243-2,064). No booster effect was observed, but immune responses were maintained above pre-vaccination levels for six months post-dose 1. Ratios of RSV F total binding antibodies fold changes to NAb fold changes ranged from 2.79 to 4.12 at 28 days post-dose 1. The impact of the adjuvant was limited.
   Conclusions: A single dose of each formulation of RSV subunit F vaccine was well-tolerated and enhanced preexisting NAb titers through six months of follow-up. (C) 2019 GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals SA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Etiology and serotyping of parapneumonic effusion (PPE) and the impact of vaccination was evaluated over a 12-year period, before and after the PCV13 introduction (2011) for Italian children From 0 to 16 years of age.
   Five hundred and two children were evaluated; 226 blood and 356 pleural fluid samples were obtained and tested using Realtime-PCR and culture. In the pre-PCV13 era S. pneumoniae was the most frequent pathogen identified (64/90; 71.1%) with a large predominance of serotypes 1 (42.4%), 3 (23.7%), 7F (5.1%) and 19A (11.9%).
   The impact of vaccination, calculated on children 0-8 years of age, demonstrated a significant reduction of PPE: with an incidence rate of 2.82 (95%CL 2.32-3.41) in the pre-PCV13 era and an age-standardized rate (ASR) of 0.66 (95% CL 0.37-1.99) in the post-PCV13 era, p < 0.0001. No increase in non-PCV13 serotypes was recorded. S. pneumoniae remained the most frequent pathogen identified in the post-PCV13 era in unvaccinated children with an unchanged serotype distribution: respectively 26/66 (39.4%), 25/66 (37.9%), 5/66 (7.6%), and 4/66 (6.1%) for 1, 3, 7F and 19A. On the other hand 7F and 19A disappeared in vaccinated children and serotype 1 and 3 decreased by 91.8% and 31.5%, respectively. Realtime PCR was significantly more sensitive than culture both in pleural fluid (79.7% vs 12.5%) and in blood (17.8% vs 7.4%).
   In conclusion, our findings indicate that routine immunization with PCV13 has significantly reduced the burden of childhood PPE in vaccinated children, without increasing PPE due to other bacteria and without serotype shift. Moreover, the impact of PCV13 may be underestimated due to the increase in pneumococcal surveillance in Italy. Data has also shown that Real-time PCR is an essential tool to better define the etiology of PPE and to monitor vaccination plans. Longer studies will be necessary to evaluate the role of herd protection in PPE prevention. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Objectives: Information search and processing is critical to the vaccine decision-making process. However, the role of drivers of information satisfaction and search is not fully understood. Here, we investigated the predictive potential of psychosocial characteristics related to satisfaction with information and additional information-seeking about the pertussis vaccine currently recommended during pregnancy.
   Design: Cross-sectional online questionnaire study.
   Methods: A UK based sample of 314 women who had given birth during the previous six months was recruited to participate. The questionnaire included measures of the psycho-social predictors: trust, coping strategies, attitude towards vaccine information-seeking behaviour and risk perception of vaccination during pregnancy, and measures of two outcome variables: satisfaction with information received from a health care professional and whether participants engaged in vaccine information-seeking behaviour.
   Results: Trust in health care professionals, a perceived behavioural control of own vaccine information-seeking behaviour, and an engaged problem-focused strategy for coping with stress were significant predictors of satisfaction with official information given by a health care professional. 40% of women sought out additional information about vaccination however, none of the psychosocial factors measured significantly predicted the behaviour.
   Conclusions: We found that high trust in health care professionals, a perceived ability to seek out accurate information about vaccines and actively focusing on problems as a means of coping with stress, drives satisfaction in official vaccine information. We also developed measures of these variables that could be used in further research. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: One of the most concerning public health issues, related to vaccination and disease prevention, is the inability to induce durable immune responses following a single-dose immunization. In this regard, the nature of the inflammatory environment induced by vaccine adjuvants can negatively impact the resulting immune response. To address these concerns, new strategies to vaccine design are needed in order to improve the outcomes of immune responses, particularly in immunologically disadvantaged populations.
   Methods: Comparisons of the scope of innate immune activation induced by TLR agonists versus cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) was performed. Their effects on the activation characteristics (e.g., metabolism, cytokine secretion) of bone marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) were studied. In addition, the differential effects on in vivo induction of antibody responses were measured.
   Results: As compared to TLR ligands, the stimulation of BMDCs with CDNs induced distinctly different metabolic outcomes. Marked differences were observed in the production of nitric oxide (NO) and the cytokine BAFF. These distinct differences were correlated with improved (i.e., more rapid and persistent) vaccine antibody responses in both aged and young mice.
   Conclusions: Our results illustrate that the innate immune pathway targeted by adjuvants can critically impact the outcome of the immune response post-vaccination. Specifically, CDN stimulation of APCs induced an activation phenotype that was characterized by decreased innate effector molecule production (e.g., NO) and increased BAFF. This was attributed to the induction of an innate inflammatory environment that enabled the host to make the most of the existing B lymphocyte potential. The use of adjuvants that differentially engage mechanisms of innate immune activation would be particularly advantageous for the generation of robust, single dose vaccines. The results of this study demonstrated that CDNs induced differential innate activation and enhanced vaccine induced antibody responses in both young and aged mice. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses have been circulating throughout the world since the 2009 pandemic. A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) virus was included in seasonal influenza vaccines for seven years altogether, providing a great opportunity to analyse vaccine-induced immunity in relation to the postpandemic evolution of the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. Serum antibodies against various epidemic strains of influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 viruses were measured among health care workers (HCWs) by haemagglutination inhibition and microneutralization tests before and after 2010 and 2012 seasonal influenza vaccinations. We detected high responses of vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies to six distinct genetic groups. Our results indicate antigenic similarity between vaccine and circulating A(H1N1)pdm09 strains, and substantial vaccine-induced immunity against circulating epidemic viruses.

AB Vaccine hesitancy is increasing and failure to vaccinate is well-recognised in Europe as a contributing factor to outbreaks of infectious diseases. In Lothian and Scotland, low vaccine uptake has been seen in migrants - notably in the Polish group who have arrived since 2004. The recent Vaccine Confidence in European Union report highlights a concerning recent decline in vaccine confidence in Poland.
   We held three focus groups containing 13 Polish women about the childhood vaccination programme in Lothian, with specific focus on influenza and Human Papillomavirus vaccinations. Key emergent themes were: trust in the national vaccination policy, trust in the vaccination providers (health professionals), trust in the individual vaccines, balancing the risk of disease, and language and communication.
   Polish norms, beliefs and behaviours shape how Polish migrants navigate the UK health system and its vaccination programme. While not confident in the Scottish primary care model and its generalist practitioners, the participants liked the ethos of informed consent in Scotland and compared this favourably with the compulsory vaccination policy in Poland. There was a belief that vaccines in Scotland were of higher quality than Poland and with fewer adverse effects.
   Respondents reported returning to Poland for specialist clinical appointments and diagnostic testing. They regularly access Polish clinical expertise and their opinions about health are influenced by Polish friends and family. They say they have difficulty finding official UK Government and health authority vaccination material and often access Polish media, online resources and information. They are familiar with anti-vaccination activities in Poland.
   Consequently, there are important unmet information needs for this group of parents who may not be making truly informed choices about vaccination. This requires further investigation especially as migration continues and declining immunisation uptake is reported in many countries across Europe. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID HELPFUL RESPONSES QUESTIONNAIRE; HESITANCY; SKILLS; ADDICTION
AB Aim: To develop and validate immunization-specific motivational-interview (MI) training for immunization nurses.
   Background: We previously demonstrated that a MI-based intervention on immunisation, performed during postpartum by MI-trained healthcare workers at the hospital maternity ward, reduced parental vaccine hesitancy (VH) and increased vaccine coverage of their children. In this study, we propose immunization-specific MI training for immunization nurses. Together, MI-based training and interventions provide complementary approaches to existing strategies along the vaccination promotion continuum.
   Design: Multiple pretest/posttest design with questionnaires self-administered before and after each training days (4 time points).
   Methods: We developed an in-person immunization-specific MI-training workshop for immunization nurses, held on two days three months apart, with 7 h of MI-training dispensed on day 1, and 4 h on day 2. The self-administered Motivational Interviewing Skills in Immunization (MISI) questionnaire was used at four time points (before and after each of the 2 training days) to evaluate three core aspects of participant MI training: (1) MI-knowledge acquisition; (2) MI-skills application and (3) self-rated self-confidence in applying MI knowledge and skills in vaccination clinical practice. Between November 2016 to December 2017, 34 immunization nurses enrolled in our MI-training workshops.
   Results: The immunization-specific MI-training improved the three core areas evaluated in participants i.e. MI-knowledge acquisition, MI-skills application, and self-rated self-confidence in applying these in vaccination clinical practice.
   Conclusions: Our immunization-specific MI-training enabled immunization nurses to significantly improve MI knowledge, skills and self-confidence in applying MI in the clinic. These results, taken together with those on the MI-based intervention for parents that we previously reported, support the notion of proposing validated immunization-specific MI training for immunization nurses in order to curb parental VH.
   Impact: Immunization-specific MI-training would be easily amenable for the training of other health professionals in the field of immunization to help promote vaccination and curb parental VH. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: HIV-infected patients are at risk of hepatitis B virus (HBV) coinfection, however, respond worse to HBV vaccination (HBV-V) than immunocompetent adults. This study aimed to determine the response to reinforced HBV-V in HIV-infected subjects under real-life conditions.
   Methods: HIV-infected patients followed at a Spanish University Hospital who were seronegative for HBV and who received three double-doses (40 mu L) of HBV-V at 0, 1 and 2 months were included. Response to HBV-V was defined as HBV surface antibody concentration of >= 10 IU/L 1-12 months after the last HBV-V dose.
   Results: Of 332 patients included in the study, 256 (77.1%) showed response to HBV-V. Median (interquartile range) CD4+/CD8(+) ratio among the responders was 0.75 (0.52-1.01) versus 0.61 (0.38-0.84) among the non-responders (p = 0.002). Independent predictors for HBV-V response were: female gender [adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 6.240; 95% confidence interval (95%CI): 1.954-19.925; p = 0.002]; non-smoking [AOR: 2.151; 95%CI: 1.243-3.721; p = 0.006]; a CD4(+)/CD8(+) ratio >= 0.67 [AOR: 2.580; 95%CI: 1.209-5.505; p = 0.014] and baseline HIV-RNA <= 50 copies/mL [AOR: 2.049; 95%CI: 1.098-3.824; p = 0.024].
   Conclusion: Accelerated administration of three double-doses results in considerable high, however still suboptimal, response rates to HBV-V in HIV-infected patients in the clinical practice. A fourth dose should be considered. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In the present paper, we investigated the molecular cloning and functional characterization of elongase of very long chain fatty acid (elovl) and fatty acyl desaturase (fads) genes in a marine teleost, Nibea diacanthus. The elongase cDNA sequence encoded a polypeptide of 294 amino acids exhibiting Elov15 activity, which effectively elongated both C18 (18:2n - 6, 18:3n - 3 and 18:3n - 6) and C20 (20:4n - 6 and 20:5n - 3) polyunsaturated fatty acids. The desaturase cDNA sequence specified a polypeptide of 445 amino acids indicating Delta 6 desaturation activity, which coul converted C18:2n - 6 and C18:3n - 3 to C18:3n - 6 and C18:4n - 3, respectively. Tissue distribution analysis by quantitative real-time PCR revealed that the elovl5 was primarily expressed in intestine and liver, while the fads2 was mainly expressed in liver and brain. These results increase our knowledge of the ability of endogenous highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA) biosynthesis in marine carnivorous fish.

ID NEURONAL MIGRATION; BRAIN; DIFFERENTIATION; PATIENT; ALPHA
AB Microcephaly is a rare condition in which the occipitofrontal circumference in a child is more than two standard deviations below the mean of children of the same age and gender. It is mainly caused by genetic abnormalities that interfere with the growth of the cerebral cortex during early months of fetal development. We present a case of a 12 years old patient with microcephaly. To identify a possible genetic origin of the phenotype, we performed array CGH and exome sequencing in the patient. Exome sequencing revealed the presence of a de novo missense mutation in the TUBB5 gene (E401K). Mutations in the TUBB5 are mainly responsible for microcephaly but the clinical spectrum is wide, from patients with severe developmental delay, and the presence of different brain malformations, to patients with only slightly cognitive impairment and normal motor development. Our patient shows a milder phenotype than other patients carrying the same mutation. These differences in the clinical features suggest that other factors, presumably genetic or epigenetic, could be modulating clinical expressivity of TUBB5. It is therefore evident that more functional studies are needed to understand the pathology that underlies the clinical spectrum of tubulin associated disease states.

AB Dengue is a severe emerging arthropod borne viral disease occurring globally. Around two fifths of the world's population, or up to 3.9 billion people, are at a risk of dengue infection. Infection induces a life-long protective immunity to the homologous serotype but confers only partial and transient protection against subsequent infection caused by other serotypes. Thus, there is a need for a vaccine which is capable of providing a life- long protection against all the serotypes of dengue virus.
   In our study, comparative genomics of Dengue virus (DENV) was conducted to explore potential candidates for novel vaccine targets. From our analysis we successfully found 100% conserved epitopes in Envelope protein (RCPTQGE); NS3 (SAAQRRGR, PGTSGSPI); NS4A (QRTPQDNQL); NS4B (LQAKATREAQKRA) and NS5 proteins (QRGSGQV) in all DENV serotypes. Some serotype specific conserved motifs were also found in NS1, NS5, Capsid, PrM and Envelope proteins. Using comparative genomics and immunoinformatics approach, we could find conserved epitopes which can be explored as peptide vaccine candidates to combat dengue worldwide. Serotype specific epitopes can also be exploited for rapid diagnostics. All ten proteins are explored to find the conserved epitopes in DENV serotypes, thus making it the most extensively studied viral genome so far.

AB Copy number variation (CNV) has been proved to be widespread in human, animal and plant genomes. Together with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), CVNs play a key role in genetic diversity. In this study, genome-wide detection of CNVs was performed based on SNP data from 24 Criollo Argentino horses genotyped with the GGP Equine70k array. Overall, 165 CNVs meeting stringent quality control criteria were identified and then aggregated into 87 CNV regions (CNVRs), representing a horse genome coverage of 13.69 Mb. Functional analysis of CNVRs allowed the identification of 337 genes implicated in a wide range of biological functions such as signal transducer activity (olfactory receptors), receptor activities and binding. Furthermore, enrichment analysis showed that the most represented protein classes (over 25%) were immunoglobulin receptor subfamily, immunoglobulins and major histocompatibility complex antigen (beta-2-microglobulin). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of CNV in Criollo Argentino horses.

AB C-repeat binding factor (CBF) dependent cold stress signaling cascade is well studied in the model plant arabidopsis but is relatively lesser studied in the crop plants. In the present study, two novel isoforms of an upstream regulator of CBF, Inducer of CBF expression (ICE), BjICE46 (1314 bp, accession number HQ446510) and BjICE53 (1494 bp, accession number HQ857208) were isolated from Brassica juncea seedlings. Genomic clones of both the isoforms (accession numbers HQ433510 and JX571043) showed three introns, out of which one intron was spanning the bHLH (basic helix-loop-helix) domain. Interestingly, the constitutive expression of BjICE53 was 21 fold higher than BjICE46. Real time quantitative expression (RT-qPCR) showed BjICE53 to be cold induced but non-responsive to phytohormones. Interestingly, BjICE46 was salinity stress induced and showed upregulation with methyl jasmonate (MeJa) and abscisic acid (ABA). This was supported by the presence of ABA, MeJa and defense related cis- acting regulatory elements in the promoter region of BjICE46. The downstream transcription factor BjCBF (645 bp) was also isolated. The promoter region of BjCBF showed three E-boxes, the binding site for ICE. BjCBF was expressed and purified from E. coli and binding of purified BjCBF with the DRE/CRT elements (present in the promoter of cold responsive genes) was EMSA confirmed. Overall, this study shows that ICE-CBF pathway is conserved in Brassica juncea along with the differential regulation of the ICE isoforms indicating cross-talk between cold and defense signaling.

AB Glucocorticoid hormones have been widely used in clinical practice as potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents. However, the underlying mechanisms of how they work remain unaddressed. Here, we used RNA-set to profile spleen gene expression in adult mice after consistent intraperitoneal injection of dexamethasone. We identified 13565 genes in control (injected with 0.9% NaCl) and 13702 genes in dexamethasone-injected group, 12920 genes were expressed in both, but 645 genes were identified only in control and 782 genes were identified only in the dexamethasone group. In the dexamethasone-injected group 101 and 67 genes were down-and up-regulated, respectively. Among these, 129 were coding genes, 19 were identified as non-coding genes or pseudogenes, and the remaining 20 were TEC (to be experimentally confirmed) genes. Gene ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway analysis revealed that the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway was highly enriched in these differentially expressed genes, and that a majority of the 129 identified coding genes were involved in immune system and cell adhesion-associated processes. Moreover, systemic lupus erythematosus, renin-angiotensin system, fat digestion and absorption, and glycerolipid metabolism pathways were significantly affected in the dexamethasone-treatment group. No obvious signaling pathway was enriched in the control group. Additionally, 20 immunoglobulin heavy or light chain variable region genes (IGH(L)Vs) were down regulated in the dexamethasone-injected group. IGH(L)Vs encode the variable region of immunoglobulin heavy chain and determine the diversity and specificity of antibodies. We were unable to determine the function of the 19 non-coding genes with differential expression following dexamethasone treatment. Our findings indicate that the expression of IGH(L)Vs and non-coding genes play an important role in the anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects of dexamethasone and could be developed as potential agents in clinical practice.

AB The insulin like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-IR) plays an important role in regulating growth and development. To investigate the effects of IGF-IR polymorphisms on the economic traits of dairy goats, polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) and DNA sequencing methods were used to screen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within 9 IGF-IR fragments in Xinong Saanen dairy goat (XS, n = 268) and Guanzhong dairy goat (GZ, n = 440). Consequently, two SNPs, including NC_007319: g.26688 C > T (Leu 608 Leu) and NC_007319: g.28273 T > C within exon 9 and intron 10 were identified in R8 and R9 loci, respectively. At R8 locus, three genotypes were found, including CC, CT and TT, with genotypic frequencies of 0.11, 0.65 and, 0.24 respectively in XS goats, and 0.13, 0.78 and 0.09 in GZ goats; three genotypes which are C1C1, C1T1 and T1T1 were also found in R9 locus, with the genotypic frequencies of 0.48, 0.20 and 0.32 in XS goats, and 0.43, 0.22 and 0.35 in GZ goats, respectively. Based on x(2) test, both XS and GZ populations were deviated from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium at above two loci. The association analysis revealed that XS goats with CC genotype at R8 locus had heavier milk density than the CT ones (P < 0.05). At R9 locus, the body height of GZ goats with C1C1 and T1T1 genotypes was significantly higher than those with C1T1 genotype (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05). The individuals of GZ goat with C1C1 genotype had longer body length than those with T1T1 genotype (P < 0.05). The individuals of XS with T1T1 and C1T1 genotypes had higher body height than those with C1C1 genotype (P < 0.05). This study can provide theoretical and practical significances to improve the milk production traits and promote the growth and development in two Chinese indigenous dairy goat breeds.

ID SKELETAL-MUSCLE; MICRORNAS; CELL; DIFFERENTIATION; NOTCH3; TARGET
AB MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous short non-coding RNAs and exert their function by targeting mRNAs of genes. miRNA-206 (miR-206) is exclusively expressed in adult skeletal muscles and plays an important role in myogenesis. However, the regulatory mechanisms of miR-206 in myoblasts proliferation and differentiation are still limited. In this study, we validated that Notch3 is a direct target gene of mouse miR-206 using dual-luciferase reporter assay and miR-206-overexpressed experiments. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the negative effect of overexpression of miR-206 and knockdown of Notch3 on C2C12 cells proliferation, and found that the effect was produced by controlling the transition of G0/G1 and S phase in C2C12 cell cycle. In summary, our results provide direct evidences that miR-206 regulates skeletal muscle cells proliferation and cell cycle arrest partly by targeting the Notch3 gene, which strengthens our understanding of regulatory mechanisms on miR-206 in skeletal muscle growth and development.

AB Abalone is an extremely valuable food source derived from cultured and wild animals, the later from populations under intense fishing exploitation and of high conservation value. As part of a long-term study to characterize genes from abalone that can be used as markers for hybrids certification, we characterised 5S ribosomal DNA (5S rDNA) in red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) and blue abalone (H. fulgens). The 5S rDNA arrays occur to a single pair of metacentric chromosomes at interstitial positions in both species. Two types of 5S genes were found, named types I and II, each associated with different non-transcribed spacer (NTS) sequences. The structure of the 5S rRNA genes and the NTS indicate incomplete homogenisation of the 5S rDNA arrays. The divergence of the 5S genes between species provide polymorphisms which can be used to distinguish red from blue abalone in forensic analysis of commercial production.

Currently, only a few Paguridae mitogenomes have been reported. Herein, we described the complete mitogenome of hermit crab Pagurus nigrofascia. The total length was 15,423 bp, containing 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), two ribosomal RNA, 22 transfer RNA genes, as well as an AT-rich region. The genome composition was highly A + T biased (71.4%), and exhibited a negative AT-skew (- 0.006) and GC-skew (- 0.138). Eight tRNA genes, two PCGs and an AT-rich region found to be rearranged with respect to the pancrustacean ground pattern gene order. Duplication-random loss and recombination model were adopted to explain the large-scale gene rearrangement events. Two phylogenetic trees of Anomura involving 12 families were constructed. The results showed that all Paguridae species were clustered into one Glade except Pagurus longicarpus, which for the first time imposed raises doubt about the morphological taxonomy of this species. Furthermore, the present study found that higher- level phylogenetic relationships within Anomura were controversial, compared with the previous studies. Our results help to better understand gene rearrangements and the evolutionary status of P. nigrofascia and lay foundation for further phylogenetic study of Anomura.

AB Ischemic Stroke (IS) is a severe and complex disorder of high morbidity and mortality rates associated with clinical, environmental, and genetic predisposing factors. Despite previous studies have associated genetic variants to stroke, inconsistent results from different populations pointed to the genetic heterogeneity for IS. Therefore, we may hypothesize that an interaction effect among genetic variants could contribute to IS occurrence rather than genetic variants independently. In this context, we investigated the association and interaction between genetic variants and large-artery atherosclerosis IS (LAAS-IS) and cardioembolic IS (CE-IS). We genotyped 435 patients (195 LAAS-IS; 240 CE-IS) and 535 controls from a population of Joinville, Santa Catarina, Brazil. Association and interaction analysis were performed by chi-square test and Multifactor-dimensionality Reduction test. We found an association between rs2383207*A allele, nearby CDKN2B-AS1, and LAAS-IS [OR 2.35 (95% CI = 1.79-3.08); p = 4.66 x 10(-10)]. We found an interaction among rs2910829, rs966221 and rs152312, with an accuracy of 0.62 (p = 4.3 x 10(-5)) demonstrating the interaction effect among variants from different genes can contribute to CE-IS risk. Further prediction analysis confirmed that clinical information, such as hypertension and dyslipidemia, presented high accuracy to predict LAAS-IS (86.47%) and CE-IS (90.47%); however, the inclusion of genetic variant information did not increase the accuracy.

AB Zinc finger proteins are a class of transcription factors with finger-like domains and have diverse uses in biological processes, including development, differentiation, and metabolism. In this study, we identified the absence of the 24 bp sequence in the third exon of the zinc finger protein 764-like (ZNF764L) gene that lead to the production of two new transcripts, ZNF764L-SVI and ZNF764L-SV2, and the sum of the expression levels of the two transcripts is approximately equal the total RNA expression level. Temporal and spatial expression showed that ZNF764L had higher expression during the embryonic stage. Moreover, the research study revealed a 22-bp indel mutation in the first exon region of ZNF764L gene. Statistically significant results (P < 0.05) were encountered for this indel for chicken growth and carcass traits, which include birth weight, chest breadth and body slanting length at 4 weeks of age and subcutaneous fat weight and others. Genetic parameter analysis showed that D is the predominant allele in the commercial chicken population. Gene expression for each genotype showed that birds carrying the II allele had a higher expression level than the other genotypes. These findings enrich the understanding of ZNF764L gene function and enhance reproduction in the chicken industry.

AB Previous studies revealed that polymorphisms in several DNA repair genes are associated with the risk of schizophrenia. The relationship between three polymorphisms (Ala499Val, PAT, and Lys939Gln) of the XPC (MIM: 613208) and the risk of schizophrenia is investigated. A total of 361 schizophrenia cases and 360 healthy controls were included in the study. Statistical analysis revealed that the Ala/Val genotype (OR = 0.62, P = 0.004) and the carriers of the Val allele (OR = 0.64, P = 0.006) were negatively associated with the risk of schizophrenia. The other two examined polymorphisms did not reveal significant association. The "Val - Lys" haplotype was associated with decrease risk of schizophrenia (OR = 0.71, P = 0.020). It has been showed that the haplotype "Val - Lys" had the lowest DNA damages, indicating that has higher DNA repair capacity. Here we found that this haplotype is associated with lower risk for schizophrenia.

AB The fluted giant clam, Tridacna squamosa, lives in symbiosis with photosynthetic zooxanthellae, and can engage in light-enhanced growth and shell formation. Light-enhanced shell formation necessitates the elimination of excess H+ from the extrapallial fluid adjacent to the shell. This study aimed to clone Na+ /H+ Exchanger (NHE) from the whitish inner mantle adjacent to the extrapallial fluid of T. squamosa, to determine its cellular and subcellular localization, and to evaluate the effect of light exposure on its mRNA expression level and protein abundance therein. The complete coding cDNA sequence of NHE obtained was identified as a homolog of beta NHE (beta NHE-like). It consisted of 2925 bp, encoding for a polypeptide of 974 amino acids and 107.1 kDa, and was expressed predominantly in the inner mantle. There, beta NHE-like was localized in the apical membrane of the seawater-facing epithelium by immunofluorescence microscopy. After exposure to light for 12 h, the seawaterfacing epithelium of the inner mantle displayed consistently stronger immunostaining than that of the control exposed to 12 h of darkness. Western blotting confirmed that light exposure significantly enhanced the protein abundance of beta NHE-like in the inner mantle. These results denote that some of the excess H(+)generated during light-enhanced shell formation can be excreted through the light-dependent ONHE-like of the seawater-facing epithelium to minimize the impact on the whole-body pH. Importantly, the excreted H+ could dehydrate exogenous HCO3-, and facilitate the absorption of inorganic carbon through the seawater-facing epithelium dedicated for light-enhanced shell formation due to its close proximity with the shell-facing epithelium.

AB Porcine satellite cells (PSCs) play a vital role in the construction, development and self-renewal of skeletal muscle. In this study, PSCs were exposed to poly(I:C) stimulation to mimic viral infection during the proliferation and differentiation phases at 0, 12, 24 and 48 hours (h) of the stimulation. The untreated and treated PSCs were analyzed by the RNA-Seq technology. There were 88, 119, 104 and 95 genes being differentially expressed in 0 h vs 12 h treated, 12 h vs 24 h treated, 0 h vs 24 h treated and 24 h vs 48 h untreated comparison libraries, respectively. The GO terms analysis results showed that during the proliferation phase of treated PSCs, the up-regulated genes related to the immune system were highly expressed. In addition, the gene expressions associated with muscle structure development in response to growth factor emerged during the differentiation phase of untreated PSCs. The biological pathways associated with Influenza A, Toll-like receptor and chemokine signaling were revealed in PSCs following poly(I:C) stimulation. The differentially expressed genes were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR. These findings expanded our understanding of gene expressions and signaling pathways about the infiltrated mechanism of the virus into PSCs.

AB This paper presents the light propagation efficiency in ultra-compact photonic crystal (UCPC) of silver (Ag) material filled with square air background in periodical lattice structure. In different angles of incidence theta, we extremely investigate the effect exerted by the angular selective in modifying the optical properties of reflection, transmission and absorption spectra. To this aim, we applied the finite-differential time-domain (FDTD) simulations under Lumerical FDTD Solutions; the broadband fixed angle source technique (BFAST) which is based on the split-field FDTD algorithm was selected for the plane wave source injection. This allows to standardize all the interested wavelengths by having the same incident angle and therefore avoided the wavelength dependence issues. It revealed that the increase of reflection is satisfied by incidence angle theta < pi/4 rad and wavelength lambda > 550 nm. In this spectral range, similar trends of reflection are seen in lower angles of incidence. The transmission is approximately 50% far to the unity due to the high reflection backed and describes divergent features to those of reflection. Addition in layers avoids high reflection, optimizes the field transmitted and enhances significantly the absorption over the Ag UCPC. The optimization of transmission is either occurs with increase in angle of incidence. Consequently, these characteristics opening the way to ensure that such structure may act as filter in electromagnetic light propagation with respect to the position of the angle of incidence and the size of the thickness.

AB The optical spectroscopy of multichannel visible and NIR emission characteristics of Sm3+-doped alkali-alkalinefluoro phosphate glasses with molar composition of PKAXfNfSm1.0:45P(2)O(5) + 15K(2)O + 10Al(2)O(3) + 19XF(2) + 10NaF(2) + 1Sm(2)O(3), (where X = Mg, Ca, Sr and Ba) were studied through absorption, emission and luminescence decay curves. Based on the absorption spectra and Judd-Ofelt (JO) theory, the JO intensity parameters (Omega(lambda), lambda = 2, 4 and 6) were determined and then used to predict the radiative properties for various excited levels of Sm3+ ion. Stimulated emission cross-sections (sigma(lambda(p))) were evaluated for (4)G(5/2) -> H-6(5/2.7/2. 9/2.11/2) and (4)G(5/2) -> F-6(3/2.5/2.7/2.9/2) transitions. The radiative lifetimes (tau(R)) calculated from JO theory and the measured lifetimes (tau(exp)) determined from experimental decay curves for (4)G(5/2) level were employed to estimate the quantum efficiency for (4)G(5/2) level of Sm3+ ions in PKAMfNfSm1.0, PKACfNfSm1.0, PKASfNfSm1.0 and PKABfNfSm1.0 glasses and are found to be 73, 74, 72 and 78%, respectively. Among all these PKAXfNfSm1.0 glasses, the PKABfNfSm1.0 glass exhibits higher quantum efficiency. The chromaticity coordinates determined from the emission spectra were lying in the orange-reddish region for PKAXfNfSm1.0 glass systems. All the results indicate that the studied glasses could be potential candidates for applications in widely used compact light sources, optical and infrared optoelectronic devices.

AB DADP crystals with different deuterium as 0%, 30%, 50%, and 70% were grown via traditional temperature reduction method and the samples were gained from the as-grown crystals in the directions of I-type (theta = 90 degrees, phi = 45 degrees). The transmittance spectrum, UV absorption spectrum, and Raman spectrum were implemented to describe the properties of DADP crystals, and the deuteration of ADP crystals makes a difference on the absorption peaks in these spectrums. Particularly, the optical band gap E-g decreases with the accretion of deuterium content. The third-order nonlinear optical characteristics were systematically represented and tested by means of 2-scan measurements with Pico-second pulse laser irradiation at lambda = 355 nm, with the results listing the reverse saturable absorption and self-focusing effect. The investigations may contribute to replenish and elucidate the application and laser-induced damage of DADP crystals.

An absorption peak (88.2%) at 18.2 lambda is achieved at room temperature, and the measured full width at half maximum bandwidth (FWHM) is 0.37 mu m. The localized surface plasmon (LSP) mode resonance results in. the absorption peak at 18.2 mu m. The absorption peak is enhanced and shifted to longer wavelength with the radius R increasing in experiments. Moreover, when the measured temperature is increased, two new absorption peaks (72.3% and 21.1%) are achieved at 14.9 mu m and 21.7 mu m. Two LSP mode resonance forms are found due to the VO2 disk shows metal nature at 69 degrees C. Both of new absorption peaks are enhanced and shifted to shorter wavelengths with the measured temperature increasing. This structure design methodology of metamaterials can be applied for achieving single band structure to dual band structure.

AB Transparent red-emitting Cr-doped Y3Al5O12 (Cr3+:YAG) single crystal (SC) was grown by the Czochralski method. Compared with commercial red phosphors, Cr3+:YAG single crystal wafers (SCWs) display excellent thermal stability and high Internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of 92%. Ulteriorly, we obtained a high-performance Ce:YAG/Cr3+:YAG SCWs-based W-LED operated at 20 mA with a CRI of 76.4, a CCT of 5236 K, a LE of 118.36 lm/W. More importantly, the white light stability of such device under 200 mA current driving was also investigated in detail. The results all provide strong support for the high power W-LEDs illumination application.

AB This work explores the influence of annealing temperature on microstructural and optical characteristics of Ce3+- doped YPO4 nanopowders prepared by sol gel method. Samples were annealed at various temperatures (T = 300, 500, 700, 900, 1050 degrees C), their structure, morphology, and photoluminescent properties were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), TGA-DTA analysis and Photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL). X-ray diffraction analyses confirmed their pure tetragonal zircon structure with average grain size from 5 nm up to 30 nm in dependence on the calcination temperature. The SEM image shows quasi-spherical agglomerated nanoparticles with no heterogenic size. Photoluminescence emission spectra of powders were recorded using excitation wavelength at 245 nm. We investigated the influence of annealing temperature on the optical properties, for samples annealed up to 700 degrees C no emission has been observed, but the emission increased with annealing temperature above 700 degrees and the characteristic Ce3+ emission bands (4f(1) -> 4f(0)5d(1)) have been observed. Emission intensity increased with annealing temperature due to beter crystallinity and incorporation of Ce3+ ions in Y3+ site.

AB Several hole-type paramagnetic defects (a hole localized at a regular oxygen ion near charged structural defect/defects) have been revealed in fast-neutron-irradiated MgO center dot 2.5Al(2)O(3) single crystals using the EPR method. Three of them (a dominant V-1 and small amount of V-2 and V-22) were recently revealed in a neutron-irradiated stoichiometric MgAl2O4, while a novel V-4 center, ascribed to a hole in a form of O- ion nearby a complex of a magnesium vacancy and a positively charged antisite defect (V-4  O--V-Mg center dot Al/Mg), was created by fast neutrons only in a nonstoichiometric single crystal. The pulse annealing of the EPR signal of these centers was compared to that of radiation induced optical absorption in the same crystals. The EPR and optical characteristics of the holes localized near as-grown structural defects in X-ray irradiated 1:1 and 1:2.5 Mg-Al spinel crystals were compared as well. The tentative scenario of the thermal annealing process of neutron-induced defects (hole-type and complementary electron F-type ones) in MgO center dot 2.5Al(2)O(3) was considered.

AB In an attempt to investigate the effect of charge transfer dynamics on the photovoltaic performance of the dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), a new series of 4,4-difluoro-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene (BODIPY) compounds were designed and sensitized. Charge transfer dynamics of the studied compounds were investigated by using fem-tosecond transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy technique. TA spectroscopy results revealed that excited state lifetime of the sensitized dyes can be controlled by altering the position of the anchoring group as well as the conjugation length of the studied compounds. Photovoltaic performances of the DSSCs produced with the sensitized dyes were evaluated by using incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) spectra as well as I-V measurements. It was found that the dye with longer conjugation length showed efficient electron injection to the conduction band of the semiconductor (TiO2) depending on the anchoring group position. In addition to that, the adsorption of the sensitizer on the TiO2 was affected by the position of OH moieties. Therefore, the results of IPCE and J-V measurements suggest that, in order to improve the photovoltaic performance, the anchoring group should be bound to the positions which do not prevent the molecular rotation. This work could be useful for developing new strategies towards molecular engineering for DSSC applications.

AB Narrowband light absorbers are of great importance in many practical applications, such as color filtering and thermal emission. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a multispectral narrowband light absorber based on a silicon nano-cavity coupled metallo-dielectric cavity. Seven absorption bands with excellent absorption features are achieved in the near-infrared region. Theoretical results indicate that the multi-band light absorption strongly attributes to the hybridization coupling between the optical modes of the silicon cavity and the plasmonic resonances of the metallic structure. These optical features hold the absorber with wide applications in optoelectronics.

AB Optical properties of a spherical quantum dot (QD) with an on-center hydrogenic impurity in the external static magnetic field are studied. Energies and wavefunctions of the impurity electron are calculated using the Lagrange mesh method. Expressions for the optical absorption coefficients (ACs), refractive index changes (RICs) and group index (GI) are derived with the help of the density matrix formalism for a two-level system, and analyzed from the theoretical point of view. The behavior of ACs, RICs and GI with respect to the incident photon energy is examined, as well as their dependence on the magnetic field strength, laser intensity and relaxation time. It is observed that all of these parameters strongly affect the studied properties of the QD.

AB The tetragonal polar barium antimony tartrate trihydrate, Ba[Sb-2((+)C4H2O6)(2)]center dot 3H(2)O, was grown to large single crystals of optical quality and several cm dimensions. A vibrational spectroscopy study, thermal expansion measurements and a determination of the pyroelectric properties were performed and possibilities for phase matching for second harmonic generation (SHG) were analysed. The crystals show a remarkable high pyroelectric coefficient, a moderate anisotropy of thermal expansion and allow for type I and type II phase matching for collinear SHG. A redetermination of the crystal structure of Ba[Sb-2((+)C4H2O6)(2)]center dot 3H(2)O at 150 K is given in addition, together with the vibrational spectra and crystal structures of two new related compounds, Ba [As-2((+)C4H2O6)(2)]center dot 3H(2)O and Ba[Sb-2((+)C4H2O6)(2)]center dot 4H(2)O, determined at the same temperature.

AB Facile photorefractive (PR) composite films were prepared. As evidence of PR effect of the PR composite films, two-beam coupling (TBC) experiment were carried out at 633 nm wavelength. Interestingly, strong energy transfers appeared under zero external electric field (E-ex). The highest TBC gain coefficient is up to 230.32 cm(-1). The TBC gain coefficient increases with the increase of photosensitizer within certain range. The probable cause of PR effect under non-external electric field were proposed.

AB Organic Light Emitting Diodes (OLEDs) offer major potentials and advantages for the next generation of lightings and displays. Nonetheless, the degradation issues responsible for the short operation lifespan of the devices has yet to be fully established even with the invention of encapsulation layers. Hence, this paper presents the failure behavior of OLEDs induced by hygrothermal effect, specifically in non-operated mode (no current is supplied during conducted the test). In this study, a hygrothermal aging test was conducted on a batch of commercially fully-encapsulated OLEDs at 85 degrees C and 85% RH in a humidity chamber. The OLEDs were exposed to such extreme condition at the different time of exposure. Through an interlayer analysis by using Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM) equipment, two primary modes of failure were noticed within the failed sample. The first process involves the formation of centered-burst defects, and the second mode is the ring-shaped delamination of cathode film. Essentially, both failure modes have destroyed the entire aluminum film and permanently changed the morphological surface of the device which has led to the total failure of the device.

AB We investigated the dependence of electrical properties on vacuum-deposition rate for films of N,N'-diphenyl N,N'-bis(1-naphthyl)-1,1'-biphenyl-4,4'-diamine (alpha-NPD) and tris-(8-hydroxyquinoline)aluminium (Alq(3) ), holeand electron-transport materials widely used in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), respectively. Hole-only devices (HODs) of alpha-NPD showed an increase of hole current when alpha-NPD layers were fabricated at high deposition rates, while the tendency was opposite for electron-only devices (EODs) of Alq(3). We found that the increased hole current at high deposition rates for HODs was caused by a horizontal orientation of alpha-NPD molecules relative to a substrate plane which facilitates hole transport through the films. On the other hand, the decreased electron current at high deposition rates for EODs could be ascribed to the increased surface roughness of Alq(3) a films which decreases electron injection. Additionally, we demonstrated that long-term operational stability was enhanced for HODs fabricated at high deposition rates and operated at a constant current. Use of a high deposition rate means a reduction of deposition time which is helpful in OLED manufacturing. The improved device performance when high deposition rates were used and the detailed understanding of its origins as we demonstrated here would lead. to fabrication of high-performance OLEDs at a low cost in the future.

AB The one-dimensional structure TiO2/Bi2S3 composite films can be used as the photo-anode in the thin film solar cells. Due to its advantages of wide optical absorption range and relatively simpler fabrication progress, the composite film TiO2/Bi2S3 show important value in the photovoltaic field. The composite films were prepared with the simple two step hydrothermal method. The composite film TiO2/Bi2S3 was treated under different annealing temperatures (200 degrees C, 300 degrees C, 350 degrees C and 400 degrees C). The effect of the annealing temperature on morphology, microstructure, crystallite size, band gap, optical and electrical properties of the resultant material have been investigated. After annealing treatment, the photocurrent density of the composite film was significantly increased. With the increase of annealing temperature, the change tendency of optical absorption and photocurrent density show the same trend, both of them first increase and then decrease. The TiO2/Bi2S3 composite film annealed at 350 degrees C showed the best photoelectric properties. The Bode-Phase plots indicated the electron lifetime in TiO2/Bi2S3 composite film with 350 degrees C annealing treatment is about four times than that in as-deposited TiO2/Bi2S3 film. The annealing treatment can promote the secondary growth of Bi2S3 crystals in the composite film TiO2/Bi2S3, increase the light absorption, improve the utilization of sunlight, and thus increase the photocurrent density.

AB We present a comprehensive theoretical study on the optical and electronic properties of the organic conjugated dimer containing the 4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b']dithiophen-4-one, as monomer unit, suitable for blue organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). Ground and excited states properties of the dimer, denoted hereafter as CPDT, were theoretically computed using the Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TD-DFT) at the level of B3LYP/6-311g(d,p) in acetonitrile, respectively. The UV-vis absorption spectrum of CPDT exhibits peaks in the range 250-450 nm and small optical band gap of 2.38 eV. The excited CPDT dimer shows emission in the deep blue domain (similar to 420 nm). The well resolved vibronic spectra of absorption and emission line profiles with good overlap have separated by the smaller Stokes shift (47 nm, 0.37 eV).
   Additionally, the two optical bands appeared at 672 nm (UV-vis) and 827 nm (PL) have been attributed to the formation of an intra-molecular charge transfer (ICT) state. Regarding the calculated ionization potential (IP), electronic affinity (EA) and the reorganization energies, the compound presents high performance of charge mobility with the International Commission on Illumination coordinates of (x,y) (0.16,0.04). The data are interpreted using molecular electrostatic potential surface and the CIE color coordinates.
   In the three layers based OLED RTO/NPD/CPDT/Alq3/LiF:Al], the electrical response was evaluated based on the current-voltage (I-V) characteristics. The threshold voltage for luminescence is about 4.6 Vat which the carriers appear to reach the CPDT light emitting layer.

AB The kinetic parameters of core-valence luminescence for BaF2 nanoparticles with different sizes were studied under synchrotron radiation excitation with photon energy of 18.8 eV at room temperature. In contrast to BaF2 single crystals the decay kinetics of nanoparticles is shown to be non-exponential indicating the luminescence quenching. We assume that the quenching of core-valence luminescence is caused by the diffusion of core holes to nanoparticle surface. The diffusion length of the core holes in BaF2 has been estimated as 2-3 nm using diffusion model of luminescence quenching in nanoparticles.

AB Nanopowders consisting of mixed a-alumina and transition alumina phases were prepared by combustion synthesis and investigated using low temperature time-resolved cathodoluminescence and photoluminescence spectroscopy under VUV excitation. The onsets of the intrinsic absorption for different alumina phases were revealed in mixed phase nanopowders by analysing luminescence excitation spectra. All synthesized nanopowders possessed the intrinsic luminescence band with a maximum at 4.6 eV, which is assigned to the radiative decay of triplet self-trapped excitons with similar to 750 mu s decay time at 78 K. A red shift by 0.3 eV was revealed for the peak of the O2- - Cr3+ charge transfer band near 7 eV as a function of particle size. This shift is correlated with the decrease of alpha-alumina particle size from 180 to 80 nm. Its origin is discussed in the framework of the Kroning-Penney model.

AB Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy has been used to measure the temperature-dependent absorption coefficients and refractive indices of different polymers in 0.2-1.8 THz spectral frequency. The coefficients of temperature-dependent Sellmeier equation for all these polymers have also been evaluated by statistical fitting the measured data, which will be helpful for the evaluation of dispersion properties of the material. Additionally, the thermo-optic coefficients have been evaluated to be the range of - 1.230 x 10(-4) to - 2.50 x 10(-4) K-1 for 298-373 K. This data would be helpful for the applications of polymers as THz-waveguide and other temperature sensitive devices. These results provide a temperature-dependent database of optical properties of different polymers for their efficient utilization in THz technology.

AB The paper presents the results of studying the effect of irradiation with 85 MeV Fe7+ ions on the optical and structural properties of nitride ceramics at an irradiation temperature of 300-1000 K. It has been established that a decrease in the intensity of absorption spectra is caused by appearance of defects, as well as an increase in impurity atoms, which lead to the substitution of AI and N atoms in the structure. The change in the average optical absorption reflects the balance between the annihilation of defects as a result of annealing at high temperatures and the processes of defect formation resulting from irradiation. An increase in the magnitude of absorption at high fluences indicates the predominance of defect formation processes as a result of the overlapping of ions and the resulting cascade defects over defects annealing. Moreover, at irradiation temperatures of 700 and 1000 K, a decrease in the density of dislocations and microdistortions is observed due to thermal annihilation of defects.

AB Nowadays, the recovering of both thicknesses and optical properties of nanometric multilayers is still a challenge. We propose a method to recover the effective relative permittivities and the thicknesses of copper/copper oxide layers, from absorbance spectra measured in the visible spectra. The experimental data are fitted with a model of classical light-matter interaction and a combination of two Drude-Lorentz laws to calculate the relative permittivities over the spectrum. The Particle Swarm Optimization and the evolutionary methods are used for the least-square fitting. A two steps study reveals that the relative permittivities of bulk cannot be used to fit adequately the absorbance curves. However, a perturbation of these reference values improves their fitting. The method is applied to the absorption spectra of a set of three copper samples that are progressively oxidized by six successive heat treatments.

AB In this paper, CuS thin films with good adherence and of different thickness in the range of 450-800 nm were prepared by chemical bath deposition method without using ammonia. The precursor solution was made by mixing copper (II) chloride, sodium thiosulfate, dimethylthiourea and deionized water. The bath temperature was kept at 65 degrees C and deposition time was varied from 3 h to 6 h with an increment step of 1 h to obtain different film thickness. A post annealing step in N-2 atmosphere at 200 degrees C for 30 min was employed to improve the crystallinity and grain recrystallization of the films. X-ray diffraction and Raman scattering analysis revealed a hexagonal covellite structure in the films. However, the formation of secondary phases in trace amount and lower degree of crystallinity were detected for lower deposition time. FESEM images showed the formation of elongated needle-like particles which were distributed uniformly over the surface. The average length of the particles are in the range of 450-500 nm. The effect of deposition time on the optical properties was evaluated and the optical band gap values were found to be in the range of 2.26-2.55 eV. Variable-angle spectroscopic ellipsometry studies were performed to determine the optical constants including inter-band transitions in CuS films. The dependence of deposition time on the electrical properties of the films were evaluated by Hall Effect measurement showing a systematic decrease in film resistivity with increased deposition time.

AB We present graphene-based metasurface structure that is actively tuned over far infrared frequency range. Tunable metasurface is created by using single ring and double ring split ring resonator (SRR) and complementary split ring resonator (CSRR). Proposed metasurface structures are analysed over different graphene chemical potential. Results of different metasurface are compared in terms of their transmittance, reflectance, phase variation and phase difference. The modulation depth of the transmittance is achieved more than 90%. It is also observed that resonance response becomes stronger when higher chemical potential is applied to graphene metasurface. The designed graphene metasurface can be used as sensor, polarizer and modulator in modem photonics devices.

AB A 2.02 at.% Dy3+-doped Sr3Y(BO3)(3) crystal was successfully grown by the Czochralski method. Polarized spectroscopic properties of the crystal were investigated at room temperature. The absorption spectra were analyzed based on Judd-Ofelt theory. Then the spontaneous transition probabilities, branching ratios, and radiative lifetime related to the F-4(9/2) multiplet of Dy3+ were obtained. The peak emission cross-sections corresponding to the F-4(9/2) -> H-6(13/2) transition are 0.10 x 10(-20) and 0.12 x 10(-20) cm(2) for sigma and pi polarizations, respectively, and at 576 nm for both polarizations. The fluorescence lifetime and quantum efficiency were estimated to be 0.82 ms and 57%, respectively. The analysis on the fluorescence decay curve of the F-4(9/2) multiplet indicated that the cross relaxation induced by the electric dipole-dipole interaction plays an important role in the depopulation of the F-4(9/2) multiplet. The results show that the Dy3+:Sr3Y(BO3)(3) crystal may be a promising candidate for solid state yellow laser pumped by a blue laser diode around 454 nm.

ID INDUCED DAMAGE; NANOSECOND; FIELD
AB With the development of the high power laser facilities, laser resistance of pulse compression grating is getting increased attention. The metal dielectric mixed grating (MDMG) is widely studied, because it has wide diffraction bandwidth, low surface stress and potential high threshold. The effect of nodular defect size on damage of MDMG is studied by experiments and theoretical analysis in two typical cases. The initial damages appear in the district of nodular defect due to local electric field enhancement induced by nodular defect, which is different with the initial damage located in grating pillar of the perfect MDMG. Laser induced ionization theory is introduced to describe the damage process and give a quantitative analysis on the relationship of laser damage and nodular defect size. It is concluded that local electric field enhancement in nodular defect area would cause the electron density to reach the critical value and lead to the damage occurrence, and nodule damage critical diameters are 1400 nm and 1500 nm respectively in case 1 (seed under the grating pillar) and case 2 (seed under the grating groove) which will lead to nodule damage initiation.

AB Rubies (Cr: Al2O3 single crystals) with 0.025-0.4 mol% Cr2O3 were prepared by the optical floating zone method, and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, optical transmission and photoluminescence (PL). Crystals were free of inclusions and cracks, and had high transmittance in the visible region. In addition to the well-known signals from Cr3+ in the alpha-Al2O3 structure, the EPR spectra indicated the presence of very weak signals, which may correspond to paramagnetic centres associated with an oxygen vacancy, and an electron-loss oxygen centre, O-. The concentration of these para- magnetic centres was at a minimum for Cr2O3 concentration of 0.15 mol%, and additional Cr3+-derived peaks were also observed with Cr2O3 concentrations > 0.15 mol%. The PL spectra also varied with Cr2O3 concentrations; the emission intensities of the PL spectra increased with Cr2O3 concentration for concentrations <= 0.15 mol%, then decreased with the further increases in Cr2O3. Thus the maximum luminescence emission intensity and the minimum concentration of paramagnetic structural defects were observed with 0.15 mol % Cr2O3, and the presence of additional interactions involving Cr(3+ )ions may contribute to the partial quenching of the luminescence at higher Cr3+ concentrations. Overall, the optical floating zone method represents an effective and economic approach to the preparation of high quality rubies, and their optimum optical properties were observed with Cr2O3 concentrations of 0.15 mol%.

AB We demonstrate a non-invasive technique, based on diffraction imaging, to remotely detect and characterize cracks in self-assembled photonic crystals. Through this technique, we measure the diffraction pattern of the cracks and determine how the orientation of the cracks varies across the sample. In particular, we characterize cracks in photonic crystals fabricated using evaporation-induced self-assembly process on a horizontal substrate. The morphological details of cracks obtained using our imaging technique match well with scanning electron microscopy images. We also develop a model for the surface of these crystals and calculate Fraunhofer diffraction patterns, using two-dimensional Fourier transform, that match well with our experimental observations.

AB The far-infrared spectroscopy was used to analyze optical properties of PbTe single crystals doped with different amounts of Si. A dielectric function that takes into account the plasmon-phonon interaction was employed in the measured data manipulation. Two frequencies of plasmon-phonon coupled modes were obtained with the best-fit method, whereas the values for LO mode and plasma frequency (omega(P)) were calculated. The best-fit to the experimentally obtained spectra agrees very well with the theoretical prediction.

AB Conditioning, fatigue and damage characteristics on the surface of DKDP nonlinear optical crystals were studied under the irradiation of 1064 nm (1 omega) and 355 nm (3 omega) lasers. Conditioning takes effect as laser fluence reaches the lower limit of conditioning, 6 similar to 8 J/cm(2) and 4 similar to 6 J/cm(2) for 1064 nm and 355 nm in our experiments, respectively; further increase in laser fluence will induce fatigue effects when fluence exceeds the "safe" fluence, similar to 10 J/cm(2) and similar to 8 J/cm(2) for 1064 nm and 355 nm laser light in the experiments; 1-on-1 damage will take place if fluence is sufficiently high, > 17 J/cm(2) (1064 nm) and 11 J/cm(2) (355 nm) in our cases. In the conditioning regime, greater fluence will result in more damage-resistant DKDP surface and increasing the number of conditioning laser pulses will have similar influence on damage resistance of DKDP surface. When the laser fluence falls into the band of fatigue effects, the laser induced damage threshold (LIDT) drops with increasing pulse number of conditioning laser incident on DKDP surface and finally stabilizes at a certain value, "safe" fluence, below which DKDP surface cannot be damaged macroscopically even if a myriad of laser pulses shoot the DKDP surface. The "safe" fluence is usually 60%similar to 80% of 1-on-1 LIDT. Our work will be beneficial to optimization of laser conditioning and to provide insights into laser-induced damage in DKDP crystals.

AB Plasmonically enhanced random lasing in eggshell biomembranes is reported using a hybrid metalorganic system comprised by Rhodamine 6G as gain medium and silver nanoparticles as the plasmonic metal. The scattering mechanism responsible for feedback in the random laser action arises from the submicron randomly arranged structure of the eggshell biomembrane. The measured spectral narrowing in the biomembranes without Ag is of the same order as of the Ag-infiltrated biomembrane, showing an emission linewidth reduction from similar to 45 +/- 2 nm below threshold to similar to 5.0 +/- 0.5 nm above threshold. On the other hand, the effect of the plasmon enhancement is clearly seen in the emitted random laser intensity, which is more efficient and with a lower threshold in the presence of the Ag nanoparticles. We also investigated the spatial behavior of the random laser emission, which shows hot spots with higher intensity in the presence of the Ag nanoparticles, arising from the plasmonic enhancement.

AB A Luminescent Solar Concentrator (LSC) is an optical waveguide of transparent host material doped with luminophores. LSC technology works by trapping incident solar radiation, converting the spectrum to the wavelength-band of interest and concentrating the light by total internal reflection (TIR) to the edge of the LSC where photovoltaic (PV) solar cell is attached. During the waveguiding process of solar radiation, a considerable proportion of photons are lost through mechanisms such as re-absorption, attenuation, scattering and escape cone losses which decrease the device optical efficiency (OE). In recent decades, various LSC generations with different configurations have been introduced and investigated to mitigate the inherent optical losses and enhance the device performance. Due to the achieved optical improvements, LSC has recently captured a significant growing interest implying its leading role as a low cost and passive technology for enhancing the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PV systems. In this paper, large and small scale LSCs have been comprehensively reviewed to study the impact of device configuration (such as shape, geometric gain, host material, luminescent species, doping concentration and PV solar cell type) on the LSC loss mechanisms and optical performance. LSC generations are categorised and shortlisted based on their configurations; moreover, their limitations, best performance conditions, best achieved results, and their eligibility for large-scale building integrated PV (BIPV) applications are discussed.

AB Incorporation of the V3+ and V4+ ions into the yttrium aluminum garnet Y3Al5O12 (YAG) lattice has been studied by the correlated optical absorption and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements. Only the V3+ ions at both octahedral and tetrahedral aluminum sites are found in as-grown crystals. However, annealing in air leads to the transformation of the V3+ to V4+, whereas annealing in the hydrogen atmosphere remains the V3+ concentration almost unchanged. Spin Hamiltonian parameters of the V3+ and V4+ ions at the tetrahedral sites including the zero field splitting and (51) V hyperfine constants are determined using high-frequency, up to 300 GHz, EPR measurements. By using the spin Hamiltonian parameters, the ground state energy levels splitting of the V3+ and V4+ ions were calculated in the framework of the crystal field theory. The g and hyperfine tensors suggest that electron density around the tetrahedral V3+ ion is distributed strongly inhomogeneously resulting also in large (40%) reduction of the spin-orbit coupling constant whereas the tetrahedral V4+ ion exhibits weaker covalent bounding with surrounding ligands. Furthermore, the obtained EPR data on vanadium ions allow to improve identification of the optical absorption peaks in YAG:V crystals.

AB The temperature of the ZnTe detection crystal in a THz time-domain system was tuned continuously from 300 K to 1.5 K to minimize phonon absorption, thus enhance its detectivity. The THz peak amplitude was observed to increase more than 10 times. To explain this phenomenon, the THz transmission spectra of the ZnTe crystal at different temperatures were also measured, and the refractive index and absorption coefficient of the crystal were extracted. The experiments and theoretic analysis reveal that the significant detectivity enhancement is due to the reduced absorption of the THz field and phase matching change in the detection crystal with temperature decreasing, which makes the ZnTe crystal suitable for integrating with cryogenic applications.

AB The non-fullerene acceptor bulk heterojunction organic solar cells (NFA-BHJ-OSCs) have attracted lots of interest due to their higher stability and greater efficiency compared with traditional fullerene acceptor solar cells. However, no simulation efforts have been done before regarding non-fullerene acceptor (NFA) solar cells to investigate the impact of technological parameters on their performance. Throughout our work, we sought out to perform a comprehensive simulation study of a conventional structure of a cell with 3,9-bis (2-methylene-(3- (1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone)-5,5,11,11-tetraki(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2',3'-d']-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b']dithiophene) (ITIC) as NFA and poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b']dithiophene)-co-(1,3-di (5-thiophene-2-yl)-5,7- bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c']dithiophene-4,8-dione)] (PBDB-T) as the polymeric donor. We studied the impact of several parameters on the cell performance and improved the efficiency by adjusting the parameters of the hole transport layer (HTL) and the electron transport layer (ETL). SCAPS program has been utilized to simulate the structure and the validity of its simulation has been verified by comparing the I-V characteristics with measurements from a reported literature. According to our presented optimization, some encouraging results were obtained: a short circuit current (J(sc)) of 16.2 mA/cm(2), open circuit voltage (V-oc) of 1.06 V, fill factor (FF) of 82.95% and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.25%. The obtained results pave the way for high efficiency NFA solar cells.

AB Ce3+, Tb3+ and Ce3+-Tb3+ activated Ba3Y2(B2O5)(3) phosphors were synthesized by a sol-gel pyrolysis method. The synthesized phosphors were investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, photoluminescence emission and excitation spectra and luminescence decay curves. In the Ce3+ activated Ba3Y2(B2O5)(3) samples, two different Ce3+ centers (marked as Ce(1) and Ce(2)) could exist. The Ba3Y2(B2O5)(3):Tb3+ phosphor shows some emission peaks at similar to 350-650 nm among which the green emission peak at 540 nm is the strongest. For the Ba3Y2(B2O5)(3):Tb3+ co-doped phosphor, the existence of energy transfer process from Ce3+ center to Tb3+ center is confirmed and the interaction mechanism between Ce3+ and Tb3+ in Ba3Y2(B2O5)(3):Ce3+,Tb3+ system is dipole-dipole interaction based on Inokuti-Hirayama (I-H) model.

AB Transition metals, such as silver or copper, can be used to enhance the photoluminescence of rare-earth ions. In this work, a novel zinc-silicate glass containing holmium and ytterbium was prepared and subsequently doped with silver or copper by means of ion exchange. The concentration of transition metals was evaluated by electron microprobe analysis (EMPA), and the oxidation state was analysed by absorption spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The waveguiding properties of the prepared samples were evaluated by m-line spectroscopy. Most importantly, the effect of transition metals on the photoluminescence of Ho3+ ions was evaluated by photoluminescence spectroscopy. The results show that copper has no positive effect on the photoluminescence of Ho3+ ions. On the other hand, silver shows significant promise because the photoluminescence of the glass increased by as much as 20%. It has been determined that the main mechanism behind this increase is energy transfer from small clusters rather than the surface plasmon resonance of silver nanoparticles.

AB A multilayer film with high reflection wavebands and specific visible appearance has been designed based on principles of photonic crystals and optical interference. The angle and thickness sensitivities of this film, which is fabricated with germanium and zinc selenide, were studied and discussed. This multilayer film possesses a high average reflectance between 3 and 5 mu m (92.1%) and 8-14 mu m (84.2%) wavebands, thereby contributing to a low emissivity in those wavebands according to Kirchhoffs law of thermodynamics. As a result, IR energy from a hot object covered with this film would be suppressed, and low IR signature is expected to be realized. Chromaticity diagram shows that the chromaticity coordinates of this film is close to those of real green plants, which will make it more difficult to distinguish this film from green plant background. Combining the above features, this photonic crystal based film is promising to realize low IR and visible signatures under appropriate conditions.

AB Laser-induced damage of magneto-optical (MO) materials is a key factor that limits the application of optical isolators in high-power laser systems. In order to investigate parameters that affecting laser-induced damage thresholds (LIDT) of MO garnet films grown by liquid-phase epitaxial (LPE) method, YIG, (LuBi)(3)Fe5O12 and (BiTm)(3)(GaFe)(5)O-12 single crystal films with small lattice mismatch were prepared in this study. The transmittance, optical absorption coefficient, crystal structures, surface quality and laser-induced damage thresholds (LIDT) of the prepared three kinds of MO films were investigated. Microstructure analysis shows that single crystal garnet films grown by LPE method have high surface and crystal quality. Laser-induced damage tests (@ 1064 nm, 11 ns) pointed out that LIDT of YIG, (LuBi)(3)Fe5O12 and (BiTm)(3)(GaFe)(5)O-12 films are 6.41 +/- 0.18 J/cm(2), 6.32 +/- 0.25 J/cm(2) and 4.11 +/- 0.27 J/cm(2), respectively, and intrinsic optical absorption coefficient of single crystal garnet films plays a decisive role in their laser-induced damage.

Here, we show an emission shift towards longer wavelength as a result of incorporation of indium into the quantum wells reaching up to 3 mu m at room temperature (RT). Additionally, we have observed an additional low-energy photoluminescence signal with maximum wavelength of 3.5 mu m at RT, which we have attributed as states localised on the layer interfaces. The activation energy of carriers trapped in those states is estimated to be 35 meV.

AB Light-transmitting measurements of white light and a consequentially chosen laser beam of 655 nm propagating through citrate- and oleate-coated CoFe2O4, FeFe2O4, and MgFe2O4 nanoparticles under the influence of an external magnetic field were presented. New experimental settings were developed for the optical study of ferrites' behavior in ferrofluid with the applied magnetic field strength within the 30-400 mT range. A magnetic field-induced change of light transmittance occurred and a precipitation of all studied samples was obtained. Optical investigations of ferrofluid suspensions revealed that, contrary to the linear aggregates of colloidal CoFe2O4 and FeFe2O4, spheroidal aggregates were formed in the case of MgFe2O4. In all three cases, the surface modification resulted in decreased dipole-dipole interactions between ferrite cores, and thus, less precipitates were noticed. All oleate-coated nanoparticles have demonstrated weaker magnetic responses compared to the citrate-encapsulated samples. The aggregation of nanoparticles potentially increases cytotoxicity. Regarding non-linear clustering of MgFe2O4 suspensions, it can be concluded that its excretion from the organism may likely be easier and faster when used in diagnosis and/or therapy. Therefore, more attention should be paid to the lowly toxic MgFe2O4 regarding its medical application.

AB We have studied a slab of an acentric biaxial Bi2ZnOB2O6 single crystal grown by the Kyropoulos method under conditions of low temperature gradients, oriented perpendicularly to the optical axis. We focused slightly behind the sample the Gaussian beam from a He-Ne laser at 632.8 nm and we made magnified images of the near field intensity on a CCD camera. A reference beam was taken from the entrance and redirected on the CCD screen to obtain a controlled wedge fringe pattern visualising the phase of the wave. The specific rotatory power was measured to be 2.74 rad/cm. We present results of conoscopic patterns obtained launching through the crystal slab a left-circular polarized beam and projecting the output beam on a right-circular polarization state or on a linear polarization state at -45 degrees from the horizontal axis. All the experimental results (optical activity, intensity and phase of the output wave and vortices) are well described by a theoretical model based on the bi-anisotropy of the BZBO crystal. The orbital angular momentum is calculated to be 0.996 h/photon for the output circular projection and 0.456 h/photon for the linear projection.

AB This work reports on reproducibility tests performed on 20 high-quality single-crystal chemical vapour deposition (scCVD) diamond samples. By the analysis of the average mobility-lifetime product of the photo-generated carriers, 12 samples were selected and arranged as pixels in a 2.5 x 2.5 cm(2) mosaic detector. Measurements carried out under a large (4 cm diameter) X-ray beam show a very high pixel response uniformity ( < 1% standard deviation relative to the mean photocurrent value) for a wide range of applied bias voltages (20 divided by 80 V). Results suggest a very high level of reproducibility, mostly due to the excellent quality of the bulk material, meeting the requirements for monitoring large ionizing radiation fields with no need for individual pixel calibration. Moreover, mobility-lifetime product demonstrated to be the most effective figure of merit for the selection of CVD diamond samples with reproducible detection performance.

DE Ternary bulk heterojunction; Dual feed ultrasonic spray method,
   unconstrained polymer blend composition
ID EFFICIENCY
AB Ternary bulk heterojunctions using a wide band gap polymer P3HT and a narrow band gap polymer PTB7 as donors and ICBA as acceptor have been fabricated using a novel dual-feed approach in an ultrasonic spray. The binary blend of two donor polymers in a BHJ formed by a conventional method in which the two donor polymers are mixed intimately in a common solvent may lead to unfavourable phase morphology due to unfavourable interaction between them and puts constraints on the composition of the polymer blend in the BHJ. The unfavourable interaction may cause severe molecular disorder leading to charge recombination trap site, and thereby decreases the device performance. In the new method proposed in this paper intimate mixing of two donor polymers is avoided, which removes the constraint on the fraction of second donor in the first. Moreover, it also results in better polymer ordering leading to significantly higher hole mobility compared to that achieved with conventional method. The steady state photoluminescence study depicts more efficient FRET in P3HT:PTB7 binary blend prepared with dual channel method as compared to that prepared with single channel mode. With this method, ternary BHJ can be prepared even with higher concentration of the third component to have maximum power absorption, without compromising its optoelectronic properties. Although the superior properties of BHJ formed with the new dual-feed method did not reflected in similar performance in device functioning, with better choice of the donors and acceptor and with more control on nanoscale morphology through selection of proper solvents the device performance may improve to acceptable level. This report opens a new way of BHJ preparation in ternary organic solar cell fabrication.

AB A bipolar deep blue-emitting fluorescent material, 1-(4-tert-butyl phenyl)-2-[4-(N,N- diphenyl)phenyl]-4,5-diphenyl-1H-imidazole (TPA-PIM) has been designed and synthesized for efficient blue organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). The photophysical, thermal and electrochemical properties of TPA-PIM are investigated. TPA-PIM possesses high thermal stabilities with decomposition temperature of 396 degrees C and shows a strong deep-blue emission at 407 nm in N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF) solution. Single-carrier devices are fabricated to show that TPA PIM has good bipolar characteristics. The non-doped fluorescent OLEDs using TPA-PIM as emitter exhibited stable and efficient deep-blue emissions with the CIE coordinates of (0.16, 0.09), the maximum luminance of 1392 cd m(-2) and the maximum current efficiency of 2.60 cd A(-1).

AB The combined influence of externally applied magnetic and non-resonant intense laser fields (ILF) on the electronic states of GaAs-based two-dimensional circular quantum rings is investigated. The behavior of the electron energy levels as a result of the variation in the strength of the external fields is studied. In particular, the effects of changing the polarization of the intense laser radiation on the conduction band potential profile and allowed energy levels are discussed in detail. The intraband transition energies and the dipole matrix elements are analyzed as functions of the applied magnetic field intensity for different combinations of the intense laser field and resonant probe laser radiation polarizations. The findings can be summarized as follows: i) the quantized energies steadily increase as functions of the magnetic field and ILF-effects, ii) the electric dipole matrix elements are larger for the case of circular non-resonant ILF-polarization and circular laser probe polarization with respect to the case of linear polarized radiation, and iii) the dipole matrix elements have oscillatory behavior due to the complex nature of the wave functions which stems from the imaginary term appearing in the Hamiltonian when magnetic field effects are included.

AB The single crystalline Lu3Al5O12: Ce3+ 0.6%,Ca2+ 0.6% garnet films co-doped with Si4+ ions were prepared by liquid phase epitaxy technique and their optical, luminescence, and scintillation properties were studied. The Ca co-doping into theLu(3)Al(5)O(12):Ce films resulted in a drastic acceleration of decay kinetics and decreased light yield due to the oxidization of Ce3+ into Ce4+ ions. The Si4+ co-doping regenerated the Ce3+ ions by virtue of charge compensation between Ca2+ and Si(4+ )ions. The Ce valence changes were evidenced from the optical, photoluminescence and scintillation studies. Significant differences between the photoluminescence and scintillation properties were observed in Si + Ca co-doped samples. The influence of Si co-doping and the effect of Ce3+ -to-Ce4+ ratio on the scintillation properties of Lu3Al5O12:Ce epitaxial garnet films is discussed.

AB Unlike the earlier nonlinear optical studies of single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) which were generally carried out as solvent, in this study, we established to deposit the unsoluble SWCNTs as homogeneous thin films by blending them with phthalocyanines in PMMA host. The structural and morphological features of the thin films were studied by SEM and TEM imaging techniques while the linear, nonlinear-absorptions and carrier dynamic properties of the thin films were investigated with the UV-Vis spectrophotometer, open aperture Z-scan experiments and pump-probe technique, respectively. In addition, the optical limiting performances of the samples were calculated from nonlinear absorption spectra. It was observed that the linear- and nonlinear-absorptions and optical limiting performance of the thin films increased with the mixing of the SWCNT sample with the Pcs complexes. We have clearly explained the mechanisms contributing to the nonlinear optical absorption and optical limiting performances.

AB The location of the lanthanide ground states with respect to the host valence band or to the vacuum level always follow characteristic zigzag patterns with the number of electrons q in the 4f orbital. The patterns that are used today evolved over the years by combining experimental data from different techniques, and they are in first approximation independent on the type of compound. Here we will demonstrate that the ground state locations for Pr3+ and Tb3+ in the currently used pattern for trivalent lanthanides appear, when inspected on the +/- 0.1 eV accuracy level, not consistent with two independent sets of experimental data. One set is from data on the intervalence charge transfer (IVCT) from Pr3+ and Tb3+ to the conduction band (CB) observed in luminescence excitation spectra. The other set is from the release of holes from Pr4+ and Tb4+ to the valence band observed in thermoluminescence (TL). In addition to the inconsistency, TL based evidence for a slight compound dependence in the characteristic zigzag patterns is found.

AB The spectroscopic properties of Mn4+ ions in solids are analyzed to establish key parameters that are responsible for the energy and the intensity of the E-2(g)->(4)A(2g) zero-phonon emission transition (R-line). These two factors of the emission spectrum are critical in determining the phosphor luminosity or brightness. The emission energy is chiefly determined by the "Mn4+-ligand" bonding covalence. In fluorides, the Mn-F bonding covalence is weak, and the R-line occur at higher energy. In oxides, the stronger Mn-O bonding covalence reduces the energy of the E-2(g) state. In oxides, the R-line shifts to higher energy with increasing local distortion of the MnO6 octahedral moiety. Those host crystals that locate the Mn4+ ion at a noncentrosymmetric site (absence of inversion symmetry) relax the parity section rule, which enhances the R-line intensity. Increased R-line intensity in the emission spectrum produces color changes that increases phosphor luminosity. The influence of second coordination sphere (next-nearest neighbors) on the R-line intensity is considered. This article establishes guidelines for the development of host crystals that meet the requirements of high luminosity phosphors for general illumination applications.

AB There are many advantages of composite transparent ceramic materials in laser applications; hence, methods to improve bonding toughness are of great interest for scientific and industrial applications of high average-power lasers. We used a combination of room- temperature bonding (RTB), involving a fast-atom beam surface treatment and diffusion bonding via post-heating, to fabricate laser materials suitable for a variety of oscillators/amplifiers. Yb:YAG/YAG composite ceramics and Yb:YAG/sapphire hetero composites were fabricated by RTB. The continuous wave laser oscillation performance with a Yb:YAG/sapphire composite disk was superior to that without a sapphire heat-conducting layer. The post-heated Yb:YAG/YAG composite ceramics exhibited a bending strength of 470 MPa which was 8.9 times as high as that of similar composite ceramics fabricated by usual diffusion bonding. We optimized the post-heating conditions of the Yb:YAG/sapphire hetero composite, including the maximum temperature and heating time course to avoid crack generation.

AB Alumina ceramics doped with a different concentration of magnesium and manganese were synthesized at a different annealing temperature and medium. An increase in the dopant concentration leads to an increase in the pulsed cathodoluminescence intensity of impurity centers at 515 nm (Mg) and 678 nm (Mn). The concentration quenching of the luminescence in the 678 nm band occurs for Al2O3:Mn ceramics. The dopants affect the luminescence intensity in the F-center band differently. An increase in the concentration of an impurity from 0.001 to 18.77 wt % in Al2O3:Mn ceramics leads to a 4-fold decrease in the luminescence intensity of the F-center. On the other hand there is a maximum of the luminescence intensity of the F-center for Al2O3:Mg ceramics with a dopant concentration of 1 wt %. The luminescence bands of Cr3+ (687 nm) and most likely F-centers (670 nm) are dominated depending on the excitation energy in photoluminescence spectra of both Al2O3:Mg and Al2O3:Mn ceramics. The low luminescence intensity of the magnesium band (750 nm) is detected upon the excitation in the band of 325 nm. The luminescence bands of Mn2+ (540 nm) and Mn4+ (650 nm) with low intensity are found in the photoluminescence spectrum too.

AB Materials for ultrafast femtosecond lasers, CaGdAlO4 (CGA) single crystals, undoped and doped nominally with 8% at. of Yb, were grown by the Czochralski method in [100] direction. X-ray analyses showed the ideal disorder on Gd/Ca sites. The decrease of unit cell volume for the crystal doped with Yb was observed. Magnetic measurements revealed that undoped and doped samples were paramagnetic. The real concentration of Yb was determined as 5% at. The XPS lines: O1s, Al2p and Ca2p are complex and they consist of the main line and additional lines at lower and higher binding energy. The intensities of additional lines decrease comparing the end and cone part of crystal, indicating an improvement of crystal structure during the growth process. XPS chemical analyses showed deficiency of Al and Ca and excess of oxygen. The oxygen excess may exist in two contributions: in one, to keep the charge neutrality as Gd-O-x sheets between CGA; the second as interstitial oxygen, responsible for brownish coloration of crystals. Dielectric properties are close to values measured for similar compounds CaYAlO4, CaNdAlO4, and SrLaAlO4.

AB A series of orange-red phosphors NaGd1-x(MoO4)(WO4):xSm(3+) (x = 0.01, x = 0.02, x = 0.03, x = 0.04, x = 0.05 and x = 0.06) were prepared by a high temperature solid state reaction in air atmosphere. X-ray diffraction, photoluminescence (PL) spectra and fluorescent thermal stability analysis were utilized to characterize the structure and luminescence properties of as-prepared phosphors. The chromaticity coordinates of the samples were calculated and located in the orange-red region. These phosphors possessed scheelite tetragonal crystal structure with a space group of I4(1)/a. Upon excitation at 406 nm, the emission peaks at 564 nm ((4)G(5/2)-> H-6(5/2)), 600 nm ((4)G(5/2)-> H-6(7/2)), 646 nm ((4)G(5/2)-> H-6(9/2)) and 700 nm ((4)G(5/2)-> H-6(11/2)) transitions of Sm3+ were observed. The optimum doping concentration of Sm3+ ions in NaGd1-x(MoO4)(WO4):xSm(3+) was x = 0.03. The energy transfer mechanism between the Sm3+ ions was confirmed as dipole-dipole interaction and the critical distance was obtained to be 21.59 angstrom. Compared with NaGd0.97(MoO4)(2):0.03Sm(3+), the fluorescence thermal quenching temperature of NaGd0.97(MoO4)(WO4):0.03Sm(3+) increases from 398 K to 473 K, which preformed higher thermal stability and emitting-color stability, and shows a great potential for its application in LEDs as a suitable orange-red-emitting phosphor.

AB Inorganic ultraviolet-electroluminescent (UV-EL) devices with a Gd3+-doped YAlO3 thin film emitting layer were fabricated by radio frequency sputtering. Three kinds of perovskite-type oxide substrates, namely a SrTiO3 single crystal (STO-SC), BaTiO3 single crystal (BTO-SC), and BaTiO3 polycrystalline disk (BTO-PC), were used for the devices. The influence of the substrates on the UV-EL properties of YAlO3:Gd3+ was investigated. It was found that EL threshold voltage, emitting locations, and EL intensity have changed depending on the substrates. The UV-EL attributed to the P-6(J)-S-8(7/2) transitions in Gd3+ was observed in the BTO-PC substrate device with applied voltage of approximately over 200 V and in the STO-SC and BTO-SC substrate devices with that of approximately over 500 V. The STO-SC and BTO-SC devices showed EL only near the edges of a back electrode, whereas the BTO-PC device showed surface EL over the whole electrode. It was considered the local EL at the electrode edges in the SC substrate devices was caused by a concentrated electric field in the vicinity of the electrodes. The BTO-PC device showed not only the lowest EL threshold voltage but also the most intense EL in the three devices. Because the BTO-PC substrate has a high dielectric constant and appropriate surface roughness, which results in a high and uniform electric field over the back electrode, the YAlO3:Gd3+ emitting layer showed intense surface UV-EL with lower applied voltage.

Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) were employed as precursor owing to synthesis purpose. Diverse characterization techniques were applied supporting the determination of structural, optical and photovoltaic properties of synthesized quantum dots. Anatase crystalline form of synthesized quantum dots was determined via X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopic technique. Morphology and chemical constitution were ascertained via scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDAX). Photovoltaic properties of synthesized pure and Zn-Ni co-doped TiO2 established that by the addition of impurities, the power conversion efficiency of fabricated device enhanced effectively.

AB In this paper we have reported a simple, one step, non toxic, cheaper and greener route method to synthesize water soluble nitrogen doped carbon quantum dots (N-CQDs) using red lentils as a precursor through hydrothermal method for the first time. The prepared N-CQDs under UV lamp of the wavelength 365 nm shows bright blue fluorescent and quantum yield calculated comes out to be 13.2%. The as prepared N-CQDs shows excitation dependent emission properties and were characterized by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), X-ray Photon spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy and Spectroflurophotometry. These N-CQDs gives high response to Fe3+ ions and lead to fluorescence quenching. This quenching mechanism was used to develop a nano probe sensor for successful sensitive and selective detection of Fe3+ ions. The limit of detection (LOD) calculated is 0.10 mu M in the dynamic range 2-20 mu M with correlation coefficient R-2 (0.993). The stability of the present sensor was tested under the effect of ionic concentration and pH which shows that it is stable in high salt conditions and there is no effect of pH to our sensor. This sensor can play an important role in regulating concentrations of iron in order to monitor health of the human body.

AB MgAl2O4 ceramics doped with rare earth ions (Tb3+ and Dy3+ ions) were fabricated by SPS technique. Optical properties and pulse cathodoluminescence (PCL) spectra were studied. The redshift effect of the absorption boundary for rare earth (RE) ions doped ceramics was shown. It was shown that cathodoluminescence spectra in nanosecond time range can be decomposed into several emission bands at 2.72, 3.01, 3.37, 3.63 eV caused by F-type centers. It has been demonstrated that the introduction of terbium and dysprosium ions practically does not change the intensitysatio of the bands at 2.72, 3.01, 3.37 eV, but leads to an increase in the band at 3.63 eV in nanosecond time range. There are emission bands related to intrinsic host defects, RE ions dopants (Dy3+, Tb3+), and trace elements (Cr3+ ions) in PCL spectra measured in millisecond time range. The dependences of kinetic characteristics of spinel ceramics were studied. In nanosecond time range, decay kinetics of the MAS ceramics is described by the sum of two exponentials with luminescence decay times are 30 +/- 5 ns and 0.8 +/- 0.1 mu s In the millisecond time interval, the luminescence decay time depends on the dopant ions.

AB This work reports the scintillator properties of barium aluminate undoped, Ce-doped and Ce and Mn co-doped phosphors. The samples were produced using the PVA-modified sol-gel route. The oxidation states of the dopants were investigated by X-ray absorption spectroscopy in the range of excitation energies that includes Ba L-III-edge, Ce L-III-edge and Mn K-edge. A multiple valence mixture was observed for both cerium and manganese. The luminescent centers were investigated using X-ray excited optical luminescence (XEOL) near the absorption L-III-edge of barium. The host emissions, as well as characteristic emissions from the dopants, were observed. The color of the scintillator emission was tuned by varying the co-dopant concentration.

AB Ca2SnO4:Tb3+ phosphors co-doped by R3+ cations (R3+= B3+, Al3+, Ga3+) can be prepared by a solid-state reaction. They are fine solid solutions, which have been studied in detail by XRD, photoluminescence spectra, and decay curves. The results show that their luminescence can be effectively improved by co-doping R3+ cations and adding Al3+ cation is superior to that with other two dopants whether in fluorescence or phosphorescence. The concentration quenching effect will weaken their luminescence beyond m = 0.07 when Al3+ cation is co-doped. The distortion of host lattice and change of local crystal field symmetry around Tb3+ due to co-doping R3+ can enhance their fluorescence. The formation and increase of oxygen vacancy (V-O(center dot center dot)) predominate in improving their phosphorescence, while the single bond strength of R-O also plays an important role.

ID CE3+-DOPED CA2AL2SIO7; PHOSPHORS
AB Persistent emission (more than 1.5 h) was observed in Tb3+-doped CaYAl3O7 (CYAM) samples after X-ray or UVC excitation. Thermoluminescent (TL) emission spectra showed that Tb3+ emission is responsible for the TL emission signal, indicating a mechanism with a single recombination and luminescence centre. The shape of TL peaks showed overlap of peaks, and thus more than one trapping centre, and this result was confirmed through T-m x T-STOP analysis. TL measurements as function of doses revealed that the TL peak positions do not change with increasing doses of UVC irradiation, which means that all TL peaks can be well described by first-order kinetics. The initial rise method was used to determine the activation energies, whereas E (eV) x T-stop plot showed a distribution of activation energy ranging from 1.1 to 1.3 eV. These depth traps were assigned to intrinsic defects in the host. Possible mechanisms were discussed considering the 4f ground state of Tb3+ and oxygen vacancies as recombination and trapping centres, respectively.

The emission intensity of a mixture of NaGdF4:Yb, Er nanocrystals of various phases was higher than that of a pure alpha- and beta-NaGdF4:Yb, Er nanocrystal, under same particle diameter. The upconversion emission intensity increased as the reduction of the local symmetry of the crystal lattice and the crystallinity increasing of NaGdF4:Yb, Er nanocrystals.

AB Nanosecond Ce:Nd:YAG pulsed laser ablation (PLA) with 1064 nm wavelength laser and 10 ns pulse duration with various laser fluence and ablation time is used to ablate pure Cu target in water. UV, Raman, XRD, SEM, FESEM and TEM analysis indicated that the synthesized NPs are spherical, core-shell type with two crystalline phases, Cu and Cu2O, and a thin amorphous CuO phase on the surface. The obtained NPs were in two different mean sizes of 40 and 80 nm. The grain sizes of crystalline Cu and Cu2O were estimated for all the synthesized samples. A growth in the Cu2O crystallinity of the NPs with enhancing of laser fluence in the constant ablation time was observed. The energy band gap of the NPs calculated for all the synthesized samples with assistance of UV-visible spectra and indicated that the energy band gaps are various between 3 and 2.5 eV. During the constant laser fluence irradiation, a red shift was observed in the energy band gap as ablation time increased. The behaviour of the UV-visible spectra, X-ray diffraction, crystallite size, mean particle size and energy band gap of the samples were studied as a function of laser fluence and ablation time.

The photophysical, electrochemical and thermal properties, as well as electroluminescent properties of the resulting iridium complexes were discussed. Both the iridium complexes possess good thermal stability and high photoluminescence quantum yields. Also, we have successfully fabricated singly doped emissive layer (SDEL) hybrid white organic light-emitting devices (WOLEDs) using (3-PyFSO)(2)IrPic or (2-PyFSO)(2)IrPic as yellow-emitting phosphors and 4,4',4 ''-tris(N-carbazolyl)triphenylamine (TCTA) as host and blue-emitting fluorophor.

Compared to (3-PyFSO)(2)IrPic, the WOLEDs based on (2-PyFSO)(2)IrPic exhibit a little better device's performances with a maximum PE of 4.70 lm/W at a brightness of 2.6 cd/m(2) and a CIE coordinates of (0.244, 0.243).

AB The new PVK-F8BT copolymer coupled to poly (9-vinylcarbazole) and poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene-alt-benzothiadiazole) has been designed and elaborated by chemical oxidation for organic solar cells applications. Structural and photophysical properties were examined using different and complementary techniques (Infrared, optical absorption, stationary and time resolved photoluminescence). The PVK-F8BT exhibited a broad absorption band covering the wavelength range from 200 nm to 700 nm covering the solar spectrum and, highlighting the charge transfer process. Moreover, the PVK F8BT, showed a low band gap to be found to 1.9 eV and it average lifetime (2.62 ns) are longer than that of F8BT. The resulting copolymer exhibits original optical properties compared to the PVK and F8BT ones. The experimental analyses were coupled to theoretical calculations based on density functional theory and time-dependant density functional theory methods in order to better understand the structure-properties correlation. Furthermore DFT and TD-DFT calculations of the PVK-F8BT have been exploited to optimize the copolymer-based composites based on bulk heterojunction based organic photovoltaic copolymers with the 1-(3-methoxycarbonyl) propyl-1-phenyl-[6,6]-C-61, as an acceptor. Thus, the band gap decreased to 1.69 eV, the power energy conversion efficiency was about 7%. Our results have allowed us to discover a promising new photovoltaic material.

AB Titanium dioxide (TiO2) thin films were grown on Silicon and glass substrates at room temperature by RF sputtering deposition technique. All deposited thin films were irradiated by 800 keV kr(5+) low energy ion beam with varying ion fluence from 1E15 ions/cm(2) to 1E17 ions/cm(2). The decreases in crystallite size from 42.09 nm to 27.36 nm (by Scherrer's formula) with increased in ion fluence were observedusing X-ray Diffraction (XRD) technique. The orientation of the different planes was observed but the plane (112) confirmed the preferred orientation as determined by the texture coefficient using XRD patterns. The surface morphology of the samples was studied by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) technique in the tapping mode and the Root Mean Square (RMS) roughness (Rq) was found to be increased from 0.739 nm to 3.20 nm with increases the ion fluence. The energy bandgap was found to be increased from 4.06 eV to 4.30 eV by increased in ion fluence due to electron confinement at nano-scale and also observed Urbach energy and optical conductivity by UV-Visible spectroscopy. The Urbach energy of thin films was observed to increased with increasing the ion fluence. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra confirmed the enhancement in the recombination of electron hole pair with increases the oxygen vacancies by increases the ion fluence. The peak at 382 nm was observed at higher fluence of 7E15 ions/cm(2), 3E16 ions/cm(2) and 1E17 ions/cm(2). In the Raman studies, all six Raman modes at their positions for anatase phase of TiO2 thin films were successfully observed. The thickness of thin films was observed 268 nm and elemental composition of titanium and oxygen in all thin films were confirmed in the ratio of 1:2 by using Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry (RBS). The electrical properties were studied by measuring the variation of current (I) with respect to the applied potential (V) at room temperature and the conductivity of the irradiated-thin films was decreased with increases of ion fluence.

AB We report the laboratory synthesis of Poly methyl methacrylate (PMMA)-Zinc sulfide (ZnS) nanocomposite via free radical polymerization method and its structural, optical, electrical, and dielectric properties for various concentration of ZnS nanoparticles. The formation of PMMA, ZnS and PMMA-ZnS nanocomposites was examined by X-ray diffraction technique, Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy and FT-Raman spectrometer. Morphological structure of PMMA-ZnS nanocomposites showed the combination of pebbled and nanosphere like structure. The in-depth topological images were examined by transmission electron microscopy which indicated that the particles were fairly in good contact. The optimized and reduced band gap was calculated similar to 3.30 eV. The photoluminescence spectra showed blue, green and yellow band with increased rate of e(-)-h(+) recombination. The decay time of the PMMA-ZnS (5.0%) nanocomposite was similar to 4.8413 ns, and the color purity was calculated similar to 34.08%. The current density increased 249% which indicated the enhancement in conductivity. The dielectric properties of the PMMA-ZnS (5.0%) showed high dielectric constant with a very low dielectric loss. The reduction in optical band gap, high dielectric constant, and increased conductivity with increased in recombination rate confirmed that the as-prepared PMMA-ZnS nanocomposite can be used as an emissive layer in OLED devices.

AB We performed a comprehensive study of the properties of La3Ga5.5Ta0.5O14 crystals grown in different atmospheres before and after the post-growth treatments (annealing in air and vacuum) using different methods to clarify the origin of defects. The optical properties and elemental composition of the crystals depend on the growth atmosphere and the atmosphere of annealing. The absorption spectra of the colored crystals contain two strong broad bands in the UV spectral region (lambda(max) similar to 290 and lambda(max) similar to 370 nm), one broad band in the visible range (lambda(max) similar to 480 nm). The spectra of the colorless crystals show a weak band at lambda(max) similar to 290 nm. The data obtained by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy indicate that there is a difference in the ratio of the main elements in dependence on the growth atmosphere and lack of gallium is observed at any growth atmosphere. An analysis of X-ray diffuse scattering indicates that the predominant type of defects is vacancy-type. There are more vacancy-type defects in crystals grown in Ar + O-2 atmosphere than in Ar. On the base of the results of our study, we propose a self-consistent model of the defect origin in LGT crystals. The main defects are the Schottky-type defects. With add of oxygen in the growth atmosphere, F-centers are formed. During annealing in air, the concentration of the F-centers increases, and annealing in a vacuum leads to the destruction of F-centers.

AB This study aims to develop an optimization-based framework to systematically analyze and assess carbon utilization strategies. To achieve this goal, we generated a superstructure consisting of a number of carbon utilization strategies, which included a series of technologies (separation and reaction) to convert carbon sources into final products. We then estimated the technical and economic parameters of all the included technologies using interactive process models. The flow and relationship information in the superstructure and the technical and economic parameters from the process models are used to develop optimization models capable of assessing the carbon utilization strategies with four different criteria: product quantity, energy efficiency, production cost, and revenue. With the proposed framework, we can answer a range of interesting questions about carbon utilization - what is the best strategy for the production of a certain product or for the utilization of a given carbon source? The capability of the proposed framework is illustrated with a coke oven gas case study. As a result, the optimal production strategies of hydrogen, methane, methanol and liquid fuels are identified using four different criteria.

AB The slagging, fouling and high temperature corrosion are major problems in biomass-firing units and lead to heat transfer limitation, bed agglomeration and metal surface degradation. This paper reports the results of the laboratory-scale corrosion studies of selected steel grades (16Mo3, 10CrMo9-10, X10CrMoVNb9-1, X7CrNiNb18-10) under biomass ash deposits. Five biomass ashes (3 agricultural biomass and 2 energy crops) were used for corrosion tests. Selected samples were doped with 0.1 and 0.5% wt. of KCl to simulate salt condensation process occurring in a real boiler. The corrosion experiments were carried out under oxidizing conditions, at 560 degrees C and 610 degrees C for 168 h. To determine the corrosion rate the mass of steel samples were measured after 24, 72 and 168 h. The corrosion products were analysed using SEM-EDS technique. The results showed that oxide scale formation rate determines the overall corrosion mechanism and the influence of ash deposits on steel. For low-chromium steels the oxidation rate is significant and a scale is a protective barrier between the deposit and metal surface limiting further oxidation process. The highest influence of ash on corrosion process was observed for high-chromium steels. However, high-chromium steels show the highest corrosion resistance.

AB A framework based on the conventional exergy analysis and expanding exergy analysis is constructed for the sustainability assessment of an energy conversion system. Based on the cumulative exergy consumption and abatement exergy consumption methods, the resource utilization efficiency indicator and the environmental impact factor are defined to evaluate the exergetic sustainability of resource and the environmental sustain ability of pollutant throughout the whole life cycle, respectively. Besides, the SJ-type oil shale retorting process is considered as the case study to display the application of the constructed framework.
   The simulated results are properly consistent with the actual data of the shale oil production process in Yaojie. In the processing capacity of 100 kg/s lump oil shale, 8.15 kg/s shale oil is produced. The total exergetic efficiency (epsilon(tot)) of the study system is 45.16%. The power generation subunit has the largest exergy destruction (49.69 MJ), which accounts for 54.12% of the total exergy destruction in the overall system. Also important from an exergy destruction point of view is the recycle retorting gas burning subunit (19.89 MJ). The power generation subunit has the lowest value of resource utilization efficiency indicator (23.36%) and the largest value of environmental impact factor (43.49%), followed by oil shale retorting, recycle retorting gas burning and semi-coke cooling subunits. Improvement strategies are proposed to improve the sustainability of the whole system.

AB The performance of gas turbine-based power plants decreases significantly as ambient temperature increases. For improving power plant performance, this paper proposes a novel inlet air cooling system based on liquefied natural gas cold energy utilization. The novel system consists of two organic Rankine cycles in series and a mechanical vapor compression chiller. A simulation-based optimization method is developed to optimize its design parameters for maximizing the power plant performance. Moreover, the off-design performances of the proposed system and the power plant with and without inlet air cooling are evaluated under different ambient conditions. The results show that the novel inlet air cooling system gives larger air temperature drop (2.1-5.3 degrees C) and higher cooling duty (6.9-7.3 MW) than a literature design. Furthermore, for 28-40 degrees C ambient temperatures, the power plant with the novel inlet air cooling produces 1.83-14.4% (6.4-52.6 MW) higher power output than that without inlet air cooling. Importantly, the novel cooling system improves the plant power output by 0.79-3.04% (2.8-11.1 MW) when compared with the literature design. Finally, the economic analysis shows that the proposed system is economically viable with a net present value of $1.6-34.4 million higher than the literature design.

TI Optimizing the operation of a solid oxide fuel cell power system with a
   supervisory controller based on the extremum-seeking approach
SO ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT

AB Maintaining a high fuel-to-electricity conversion efficiency over a long period of time is important for successful market deployment of SOFC power systems. The conventional control solutions usually do not suffice to reach this goal. In order to properly handle variable load conditions and to mitigate degradation processes, online optimization is needed to adjust the process variables and to run the process as close as possible to the operational optimum. In this paper, a supervisory controller is proposed to optimize the operation of the SOFC power system. The outputs of the supervisory controller are references for the low-level controllers. The optimization is solved by means of the extremum-seeking approach where optimum is sought directly on the process. The main advantage is that the model of the process is not needed. The supervisory controller is assessed on a detailed physical model of a 2.5 kW SOFC power system at different load conditions. Simulation results show that the supervisory controller is capable to improve electrical efficiency and keep the system temperatures within the safe ranges. Consequently, degradation processes associated with the thermal stress of the stack are reduced. Due to the slow dynamics of the stack thermal processes, the convergence rate of the supervisory controller is rather slow. The proposed supervisory controller is thus appropriate for SOFC power systems that operate at constant load conditions over long periods of time.

AB Conventional coal gasification to methanol technology in China results in serious environmental problems. Therefore, a great number of studies focus on the low carbon solutions for methanol production. Our work analyzed and compared the life cycle environmental and economic performance of solar energy integrated methanol production systems in China with the aid of GaBi software. There are three methanol production routes involved in our study: conventional coal to methanol system (Baseline case), solar energy coupled with coal gasification to methanol system (Case-1), solar energy-biomass assisted CO2 hydrogenation to methanol system (Case-2). The results indicate that the environmental impacts of Case-1 and Case-2 are at least 45.7% and 57.5% smaller than the selected impact categories of baseline case, respectively. In Case-2, the utilization of biomass integrated gasification combined cycle (Bio-IGCC) with CO2 capture system leads to negative life cycle greenhouse gas emission (-1092.1 kgCO(2)eq/ton) of the whole system. However, in economic aspect, the methanol cost of Case-1 and Case-2 is about 3 times and 5 times that of Baseline case (1593.4 RMB/ton). If considering the average carbon tax level (500 RMB/ton CO(2)eq) in 2030 reported by World Bank, the Case-1 route is expected to be economic feasible in the near future, while the Case-2 is still difficult to have economic advantage compared with the Baseline case. The key to solving the cost problem of Case-2 lies in developing highly efficient photovoltaic electricity generation and biomass integrated gasification combined cycle system, decreasing the capital cost of solar photovoltaic power station, biomass integrated gasification combined cycle station and polymer electrolyte membrane modules for water electrolysis.

AB Thermal management is critical for improving the performance of a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC). Operation temperature can directly affect the saturated water vapour pressure and thus the water transport between the anode and cathode in PEMFCs. However, current researches on the effect of operation temperature on the performance are based on convenient design of a joint coolant flow channel for the anode and cathode. Consequently, the independent effect of the temperature on the anode or cathode is ignored. In this study, a single PEMFC with separated coolant flow channels in the anode and cathode is fabricated to investigate the effects of different anode and cathode operation temperatures on the performance. The results show that different anode and cathode operation temperatures could affect the performance of PEMFCs. A lower anode temperature improved the electro-osmotic drag role of water transport from anode to cathode. Hence, the PEMFC performance increased both with the increasing cathode operation temperature and the temperature differences between the cathode and anode. Higher operation temperature improves the activity of the catalyst, and water management and elevated operation pressure affect the kinetics of the electrochemical reaction. Peak performance is obtained through the balance of operation temperature, pressure and water management, particularly for different anode and cathode operation temperatures of PEMFCs.

AB A novel solar assisted cogeneration system composed of a parabolic dish collector (PDC), a vacuum thermionic generator (VTIG), and an absorption refrigerator (APR) is proposed, in which the APR harvests the rejected heat from the VTIG for further cooling production. The equivalent power output and efficiency of the proposed system are obtained by considering various irreversible losses including radiation and convection heat losses of the PDC, radiation heat losses between the cathode and anode of the VTIG, heat transfer irreversibility, irreversible effects inside the working fluid of the APR. The maximum attainable efficiency increases from 17.21% to 27.06% as the bottoming APR is hybridized into the system. Meanwhile, the corresponding power density gains a 13.47% increase. Comprehensive sensitivity analyses are conducted to examine the dependence of the proposed system performance on some decisive design parameters and operating conditions such as absorber temperature of the solar collector, solar concentration ratio, solar irradiance, work function and anodic temperature of the VTIG, heat transfer area, heat transfer coefficient, and internal irreversibility factor of APR. The obtained results may provide some new insights into development and operation of such a solar powered cogeneration system.

AB The need for fossil-free fuels in transportation will likely cause increased demand for liquid biofuels, which will affect biomass prices and hence alter fuel usage for heat and power generation. Despite obvious connections, the interactions between the forest, bioenergy and energy sectors are only analyzed to a limited extent in previous research. This study analyzes how increased forest-based biofuel production influences fuel use in the Nordic district heating sector, as well as power prices and investments in renewable power production. The novel contribution of the study is the linking of a detailed energy system model and a forest sector model covering forestry and forest industries in the Nordic countries. For the Nordic region, the use of biomass for power and heat is reduced by more than 50% when the biofuel production is assumed to increase from 0 to a 40% share of the transportation fuel market. The results contribute to the understanding of how large-scale biofuel deployment may affect heat and power markets and, in turn, the development of renewable energy systems. Policies targeting the enhancement of specific uses of biomass should take these market effects in the bioenergy and energy markets into account.

AB Solar energy is globally promoted as an effective alternative power source to fossil fuels because of its easy accessibility and environmental benefit. Solar photovoltaic applications are promising alternative approaches for power supply to buildings, which dominate energy consumption in most urban areas. To compensate for the fluctuating and unpredictable features of solar photovoltaic power generation, electrical energy storage technologies are introduced to align power generation with the building demand. This paper mainly focuses on hybrid photovoltaic-electrical energy storage systems for power generation and supply of buildings and comprehensively summarizes findings of authorized reports and academic research outputs from literatures. The global installation capacity of hybrid photovoltaic-electrical energy storage systems is firstly examined to show the significant progress in emerging markets. Particularly, the latest installation status of photovoltaic-battery energy storage in the leading markets is highlighted as the most popular hybrid photovoltaic-electrical energy storage technology for building applications. The research progress on photovoltaic integrated electrical energy storage technologies is categorized by mechanical, electrochemical and electric storage types, and then analyzed according to the technical, economic and environmental performances. Moreover, extensive research on hybrid photovoltaic-electrical energy storage systems is analyzed and discussed based on the adopted optimization criteria for improving future applications in buildings. It is indicated that the lithium-ion battery, supercapacitor and flywheel storage technologies show promising prospects in storing photovoltaic energy for power supply to buildings. Potential research topics on the performance analysis and optimization evaluation of hybrid photovoltaic-electrical energy storage systems in buildings are identified in aspects of the local adaption, flexible control, grid integration, as well as building resilience and intelligence. This study provides an insight of the current development, research scope and design optimization of hybrid photovoltaic-electrical energy storage systems for power supply to buildings and can serve as an explicit guide for further research in the related area.

AB In this paper, several cost metrics for application to a combined heat-and-power plant fueled by a zero-marginal cost energy source are studied. The mature levelized cost concepts are extended with some novel metrics such as the levelized cost of exergy. The results are given for a geothermal combined heat-and-power plant, connected to two different types of district heating systems and for two scenarios for the heat and electricity prices (high and low). For a low price scenario, the conventional costing method based on two separate prices for electrical and thermal energy is the most appropriate. Also for a high price scenario, the conventional costing method is the most appropriate for heat demands at low temperature. However, for higher-temperature heat demands, the exergy costing method results in the highest revenues for the combined heat-and-power plant. The authors recommend the use of the novel levelized cost of exergy metric as different types of energy are priced with a single value. Depending on the amount of energy and the usefulness of the energy type, an appropriate cost can be allocated to each product of a multi-energy system.

AB The study outlines an economical biorefinery concept to evaluate the potential of three aquatic weeds Eichhornia crassipes, Lemna minor and Azolla microphylla for co-production of ethanol and methane. Four different scenarios were investigated viz., scenario A-hydrothermal treatment followed by anaerobic digestion and ethanol fermentation respectively (HT -> AD -> EF), scenario B- thermochemical treatment followed by anaerobic digestion and ethanol fermentation respectively (TC -> AD -> EF), scenario C- hydrothermal treatment followed by ethanol fermentation and anaerobic digestion respectively (HT -> EF -> AD) and scenario D- thermochemical treatment followed by ethanol fermentation and anaerobic digestion respectively (TC -> EF -> AD). Sequential hydro thermal treatment and anaerobic digestion (HT -> AD) in scenario A enhanced the hemicellulose removal by 68.5-73.5% and simultaneously enriched the cellulose content by 41.2-54.5%. This contributed to highest ethanol yield (0.167-0.231 g/g biomass) in scenario A, which was found comparable to that obtained in scenario D, wherein harsh and expensive thermochemical pretreatment was employed. Besides that, relatively higher methane yield of 209-257 dm(3)/kg TOCR (Total organic carbon removal) obtained in scenario A as compared to other scenarios (67.5-238 dm(3)/kg TOCR) improved the overall energy efficiency of the studied concept. The energetic assessment showed lowest total energy output (859.6-1322.7 kwh) in scenario B and C as compared to other scenarios (1041.8-1583.9 kwh), thereby confirming their incompetence in coupled bioenergy production. This study, therefore presents an economically and energetically sustainable approach for pretreatment and bioenergy production that could help in overcoming the constraints hindering the commercialization of cellulosic ethanol. The study also opens up possibility for development of coupled aquatic weeds-based wastewater treatment and bioenergy production system for an efficient exploitation of the phytoremediation property of aquatic weeds.

AB In the present study, novel processes for the offshore production of methanol via alternative routes than reforming of synthesis gas are investigated. Two process schemes are defined differing in the carbon source in input, i.e. the catalytic hydrogenation of carbon dioxide and the direct oxidation of methane via radical gas reaction. Both the schemes are considered to be installed at the main facility of the Canadian Sable Offshore Project in the Atlantic Ocean, the gas production Thebaud platform. Both offshore wind farm and solar parabolic trough systems are integrated to supply electricity and heat power to each process. The Aspen HYSYS is used to simulate the chemical processes, while Homer Pro and System Advisor Model are adopted for the design of feasible renewable energy plants. A thermodynamic modelling through energy analysis is conducted to evaluate and compare the energy efficiencies of sub-systems and overall schemes. Moreover, a preliminary design analysis is performed to estimate the footprint required for the components of the two schemes located on the offshore facility. The present results reveal that the methane-to-methanol process makes more efficient use of the integrated renewable sources but requires relatively higher space at the installation than the other scheme.

AB Integration with the grid is the general trend in the development of solar chimney power plant (SCPP). It is important to dispatch the electricity from the grid-connected SCPP in a proper manner. The power dispatching scheme would be changed by various heat storages which can control the power output profile of the SCPP. Optimal design of the heat storage in the SCPP aiming at minimizing the total electricity dispatched (TED) remains unknown. The governing equations regarding air flow and heat transfer are solved to realize 24-hour simulation of SCPP. The power dispatching scheme is then available based on the calculated power output profile and a specified load curve using the integration method. The influences of various heat storages and various solar radiation intensities on power dispatching are evaluated. Results show the water-filled systems perform better than natural grounds in reducing the TED generally. The TED can be a design index of the heat storage in the SCPP. The power dispatching schemes are classified into three categories according to various solar radiation intensities. The water-filled heat storage of 0.2 m in thickness performs the best in this paper.

AB In this paper, experimental and simulation study provides a detail analysis of operational characteristics for hydrogen charging (5 kW(p) photovoltaic + 0.6 kW electrolyzer + 5000 L metal hydride (MH) storage) and discharging (1 kW proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) + MH storage) units in a microgrid. Hydrogen charging and discharging processes in MH storage are exothermic and endothermic in nature, respectively, therefore, a suitable thermal management (cooling/heating system) is required. The simulation model of given metal alloy (LaNi5), size and storage capacity of MH cylinder helps to predict the potential of dynamic charging and discharging rates with change in the external cooling/heating management and therefore to design the suitable thermal management system. Results show that dynamic variation in the discharging rate from the MH depends on the management of the external heating system, amount of stored hydrogen, operating temperature and pressure of MH cylinder. The hydrogen discharging rate up to approximate to 60 L per minute (lpm) can be obtained at 50 degrees C temperature and 1 lpm flow rate of external heating water. 5000 L MH storage is capable to provide the stable hydrogen supply (approximate to 12 lpm) for approximate to 1 kW PEMFC generator operation up to approximate to 5.5 h with heating system (30 degrees C inlet temperature and 1 lpm flow rate of water). Dynamic operational characteristics of MH storage with electrolyzer and PEMFC show that the appropriate use of designed thermal management system facilitates the proper functioning of overall system.

AB This paper examines the effects of varying the battery pack geometry, mainly the spacing between the batteries in the pack, when it is cooled with recently proposed liquid to vapor battery cooling systems. In these, the coolant forms a liquid pool in which the batteries in the pack are partly or completely submerged. The liquid pool is kept at a pressure for which the corresponding saturation temperature is around the lower end of the battery optimum operation temperature. When the batteries are charging or discharging they generate thermal energy and their temperature increases, and exceeds the saturation temperature of the pool. Then, the pool absorbs the generated heat and starts to evaporate. Some of the advantages of the liquid to vapor cooling system are higher latent heat, which increases the amount of heat the system can remove, and constant phase change temperature. In addition, the phase changing from liquid to vapor has the advantage of high heat transfer rate of boiling when the temperature of the surface is high enough (5 degrees C more than the saturation temperature). The main parameter considered in this study is the spacing between the batteries in the pack. Four different battery spacings are considered, which are essentially multiples of the radius of the battery, including twice the radius, equal to the radius and half of the radius. The effects on the performance of the considered parameters are measured and assessed through the thermal performance of the cooling system, which is measured by the battery maximum temperature and the maximum temperature difference across the pack and through the battery. The performance is assessed through 600 s of charging and discharging cycles for various cycle rates (4C, 5C and 6C) and for a constant amount of liquid coolant initially covering the entire height of the battery. The results show that reducing the spacing between the batteries increases the maximum temperature of the battery, but improves the thermal uniformity through the battery. Only the configuration with battery spacing equal to twice the radius, was able to maintain coolant in the liquid phase at the end of the 600 s 4C cycle.

AB In this research, an energy harvesting system was developed for power generation using a combination of an Archimedes Screw Turbine (AST) and a solar Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) system. An AST was numerically used and optimized for producing mechanical power as an energy harvesting technique. Different structural parameters including the screw inclination angle, number of flights and the screw length were considered. A parabolic trough concentrator was numerically modeled as a heat source of the ORC system. Two different types of absorber were considered using a smooth and corrugated tube. Different ORC working fluids were investigated in the solar ORC system including R134a, R245ca, R245fa, R152a, R113, R11, and R114b. The results of numerical modeling were validated with experimental results and good agreement was found. The results revealed that R113 at the saturated condition at turbine inlet gave the highest ORC net power, ORC efficiency, and total efficiency compared to the other investigated working fluids. The solar PTC system with the corrugated tube showed the higher ORC net power, and overall efficiency compared to the smooth tube as the PTC receiver. The highest efficiency resulted in the screw length of 1.5 m was 58.24% with inclination angle of 25 degrees and flight number of 1. Finally, the optimized characteristics of power generation system including a solar ORC system and a screw turbine (hybrid system) were presented to harvest energy. Application of the presented hybrid system is an acceptable way for increasing and optimizing the ORC power generation.

AB In this work, a novel vapour-liquid channel-separated ultra-thin (0.4-mm-thick) vapour chamber fabricated via etching and diffusion bonding was designed for cooling electronic devices. The heat performance of ultra-thin vapour chamber was tested under five states, and micropillar arrays were etched into the chamber to study their effect on heat transfer. Additionally, infrared thermal imaging was performed to investigate the heat dissipation of cooling modules with and without the ultra-thin vapour chamber. The maximum heat transfer capacity of the ultra-thin vapour chamber in the horizontal state was 4.50 W, and the temperature difference was 4.75 degrees C. The experimentally measured values were very close to the theoretical capillary limit. Under normal and reverse gravities, the maximum heat transfer capacity changed by less than 11%. The effective thermal conductivity of the ultra-thin vapour chamber was 12000 W/(m.K), which is 30 times higher than that of pure copper. The cooling module with the ultra-thin vapour chamber exhibited better heat dissipation, thermal uniformity and thermal response properties. When the heating input power was 6 W, the heating block temperature, maximum surface temperature difference and equilibrium time of the cooling module with the ultra-thin vapour chamber were 8%, 54% and 32% lower, respectively, than those of the module without the ultra-thin vapour chamber. The proposed cooling solution is promising for heat dissipation problems in high-power portable electronic devices.

AB By using stochastic Lotka-Volterra model, we make a cross-country analysis to potential interactions between penetrations of wind and photovoltaic (PV) technology within uncertain technology ecological systems, and explore the possible distributions of stochastic technology proliferation orbits. We find both positive and negative scale effects for wind markets, while PV solar markets are consistently scale-restrictive for all the target countries; the current technology interactions are dominated by mutualism and prey-predator types, of which prey-predator relationships mainly exist in the US, China and Italy, with PV solar to be predators. Most importantly, we find significant relationships between stochastic technology diffusion orbits and deterministic technology equilibrium orbit; specifically, random orbits of cumulative installed capacity for both wind and PV solar oscillate around the equilibrium orbit under the deterministic Lotka-Volterra model, normally distributed, and the mean orbit of such large-scale random orbits converges to the analytic equilibrium orbit. This finding makes great sense to identify countries with stable technology diffusion distributions, and contributes to exploit predictive features of stochastic Lotka-Volterra model. On this basis, we recognize 3 countries with normally distributed random orbits of technology penetration, i.e., India, Japan and Italy, and three-year forecasts to 2020 are provided for both wind and PV solar technology.

AB In the last years an increasing interest has grown about the organic Rankine cycle (ORC) for waste heat recovery from the engine exhausts, as a feasible way to improve the efficiency of internal combustion engines (ICE). However, the highly variable working conditions in which an engine usually works make the operation of the ORC unit very challenging. In the management of ORC units, optimization and control are considered as an essential step in order to attain good performance during the whole operation of the ICE on a driving cycle. In this paper a GT-Power model of a 12.61 turbocharged Diesel engine is used as a typical heavy duty Diesel engine to retrieve the temperature and the mass flow rate of the exhaust gases during a heavy heavy-duty driving cycle. An optimization process is performed to maximize the power output of the ORC as a function of the revolution speeds of the pump and of the turbine. For powertrain electrification purposes, two different ORC layouts are proposed in this paper, both seeking to store the recovered energy into a battery pack. The first layout is optimized based on mean values of exhausts temperature and mass flow rate, while the second layout is designed to control independently the revolutions of the pump and of the turbine of the ORC unit toward optimal values for maximum net power output. Both the layouts allow to recover an interesting amount of energy, in spite of a straightforward control strategy. Nonetheless, results show that optimizing the net power of the ORC cycle by decoupling the turbine and the pump may not ensure the maximization of the recovered energy. In fact, the storable energy from the ORC unit is strongly affected by the conversion efficiencies related to the specific layout.

AB In this work, a novel hybrid system based on absorption-recompression refrigeration system, compressed air energy storage (CAES) and wind turbines is proposed for using in retail buildings. In proposed system, wind turbines are employed to provide electricity during off-peak hours. Using conventional environmental pollutant combustion chambers and refrigerants in CAES and refrigeration subsystems have been eliminated in present system. So, it is an entirely environmentally-friendly system. By tailoring a booster vapor compressor between the generator and condenser of the conventional absorption cycle and achieving full heat transfer between them, the efficiency has been significantly improved. To override the further energy consumption of the vapor compressor, coupling with a CAES system is investigated. Energy, exergy, economic and parametric investigations are applied to the proposed system and its single parts to have a comprehensive evaluation. As a result, 2287 kW cooling capacity, 2.431 total coefficient of performance and 56.71% roundtrip efficiency (RTE) are reached. The results indicate that the payback period of the proposed system is less than 6 years and 187.65 $ is saved in each cycle of the hybrid system. Furthermore, the exergy analysis represents that the pressure regulating valve in CAES and condenser/generator in refrigeration subsystems have the maximum exergy destruction.

AB This work discusses the advantages that can be obtained from the integration of landfill gas with biomass gasification. The case study presented consists of a landfill located in the province of Reggio Emilia, in the north of Italy. Landfill gas from municipal-waste fuels four internal combustion engines with overall nominal power of 2 MW, the electricity is sold back to the grid, while the thermal power is used for the heating of an industrial greenhouse compartment for basil production. Within the same facility, green waste is collected from the surrounding municipalities then chipped and sieved. Fine particles are disposed into a composting plant close by, while the sieved fraction is sold to the market for electricity production in large-scale boiler-based power plants. The idea here presented and discussed consists of the implementation of a gasifier to convert the sieved fraction of green waste into a syngas fuel directly on site. Syngas is blended with the landfill gas and then fed to the gas engines. In this work green waste gasification is tested in a commercial small-scale gasifier, proving that sifted green waste is a suitable fuel for this application. A specific consumption of 1.2 kg/kWh and a total electrical efficiency of 16.22% were measured. The sizing of the full-scale gasification facility is based on both the experimental results and data about the local availability of green waste. The economic return of the investment is then discussed. Finally, a further level of integration between gasification and the existing site is proposed: gasification-derived biochar is investigated as soil amendment for the on site company at the landfill that grows basil commercially. Results of 55 days in vivo tests show an increase in the biomass production of the basil of 53% compared to the control test group.

AB In the presented study, the influence of lean-burn on combustion and emission performance of diesel pilot ignition natural gas engine was investigated by using the method of computational fluid dynamics coupling with the reduced chemical kinetic model. Based on bench tested results, the computational fluid dynamics model was validated in four typical conditions, and then it was used for the simulation at different excess air coefficient. Due to the visibility of computational fluid dynamics results, the combustion medium process and emissions medium products were obtained, which then were used to explain the influence mechanism of excess air coefficient. The simulated results show that, under 50% load, the maximum cylinder pressure becomes larger and the start of combustion is advanced when the excess air coefficient increases from 1.0 to 1.5, and the maximum advance of the start of combustion reaches 9.5 degrees CA. Nevertheless, under 100% load, the start of combustion is advanced first and then retarded. Meanwhile, the higher the excess air coefficient is, the earlier the heat release rate shoots up. When the excess air coefficient increases from 1.2, the 10-50%, 50-90% and 10-90% combustion duration become longer. The nitrogen oxide emission increases as the excess air coefficient rises from 1.0 to 1.1 but decreases if it continues to increase. The unburned methane emission decreases first and then increases with the increase of the excess air coefficient. Nevertheless, at 1500 rpm and full load, the unburned methane emission shoots up as the excess air coefficient changes from 1.3 to 1.5 and the maximum difference of unburned methane emission reaches 3233 ppm.

AB A novel caudal-fin-inspired hourglass-shaped self-agitator installed inside a plate-fin heat exchanger has been experimentally investigated to characterize its thermo-hydraulic performance. Because of fluid-structure interaction between the air and the caudal-fin-inspired hourglass-shaped self-agitator, there is periodic conversion between fluid kinetic energy and elastic strain energy. Vortices generated by the self-sustained vibration of the self-agitator enhance flow mixing and thus heat transfer performance. Experiments were conducted at a wide range of Reynolds numbers from 400 to 10,000, which covered the laminar-transitional-turbulent regime. Experimental correlations of pressure drop as a function of a dimension parameter, friction factor, and Nusselt number have been proposed. Mutual coupling motions and effects of multiple-row flapping caudal-fin-inspired hourglass-shaped self-agitators in parallel and tandem configurations were studied by using a high-speed camera. A stereo Particle Image Velocimetry system was used to conduct detailed flow field measurements to quantify the flow mixing level. Parameter studies for the stream-wise distance (Le., the pitch) between the neighboring caudal-fin-inspired hourglass-shaped self-agitators have been investigated to exploit the best performance of the heat exchanger equipped with caudal-fin-inspired hourglass-shaped self-agitators. For the chosen plate-fin heat exchanger and assigned working conditions, the best heat transfer performance was obtained with twelve-row self-agitators with a pitch of 12.5 mm, which caused a 200% increase in the Nusselt number over the clean channel at the same Reynolds number. However, the best overall performance was obtained with six-row self-agitators with a pitch of 25 mm, which caused a 68% enhancement in thermal-hydraulic characteristics compared to the clean channel at the same Reynolds number.

AB To analyze the effects of hydrogen charge concentration (HCC) and injection angle (IA) on the lean combustion in a gasoline Wankel engine, the present work implemented a numerical simulation model coupling with the kinetic mechanisms and validated with the experimental data. Results found that with the increase in HCC, the penetration of hydrogen injection is enlarged and the area of the high-speed jet flow is expanded. The jet-flow area for IAs of 45 degrees or 135 degrees is larger than that of 90 degrees. Changing IA could obtain the hydrogen distribution at different regions of the rotor chamber and IA of 90 degrees acquires the smallest hydrogen-rich region. Increasing IA brings about the reduced flame speed substantially; the flame area for IAs of 45 degrees and 90 degrees expands with the increment of HCC whereas the contrary pattern is witnessed at the IA of 135 degrees. Smaller IA leads to the major burning occurring untimely, which resulting in less work delivery of the engine. The hydrogen consumption for lAs of 45 degrees and 90 degrees increases as HCC is ascendant while that for IA of 135 degrees is just the reverse. Variations in the mixture distribution and turbulence are the intrinsic mechanism of how the HCC and IA reflects the combustion progress. As hydrogen is injected with larger HCC and smaller IA, a relatively richer mixture and higher turbulent kinetic energy are distributed close in the spark ignition region. The peak combustion pressure reduces and its corresponding crank position delays with the widened IA at any HCC. Considering the fuel combustion and nitric oxide formation, as hydrogen volume fraction is 3% and IA is 45 degrees, the engine could realize the optimized performance under the computational condition. An efficient combustion performance may be performed in engineering application if the hydrogen IA is in accordance with the rotor rotating direction at lower HCC.

AB Although individual commercial thermoelectric module has been widely investigated and its cooling behavior is clear, jointed thermoelectric modules show completely different cooling behavior and higher coefficient of performance (without the change of input electrical power) which requires further study. At the first step of this research, cooling characteristics of 2-jointed, 4-jointed and 6-jointed thermoelectric modules are experimentally evaluated and discussed under the same range of input electrical power. In the same total input electrical power, 6-jointed TEM (thermoelectric module) provided around 100% higher COP (coefficient of performance) than the 2-jointed TEM which was significant. Cooling behavior of different-number jointed TEM (in the same input power) are analyzed and discussed in this paper. In the second step of this research, the COP of 6-jointed TEM cooler (selected from the first step) has been increased again by proposition of two new techniques based on the modification of the popular rectangular-fin heat sink. Attempts are made to further enhance the COP of the system by two methods including "perforating technique" and "spring wire technique" through a Peltier air cooler which have not been proposed before. In the same electrical power input, perforating technique enhanced the thermal performance of the Peltier air cooler around 50% (totally 150% compared to the 2-jointed TEM with simple heat-sink) and the use of spring-wire between the fins of heat-sink improved the COP around 130% (totally 230% compared to the 2-jointed TEM with simple heat-sink). Exact explanation of the quality/quantity and improvement reasons of each technique are described in this paper for different working conditions of the cooler.

AB In the present study, a novel and flexible experimental facility of an organic Rankine cycle system is constructed. Four extra heat exchangers than traditional test bench are equipped for the system performance testing with different evaporator and condenser or heat transfer examinations of the evaporator and condenser. The combination of an expansion valve and a cooler is designed to simulate the expander with desired type and expansion characteristic. Meanwhile, a scroll expander is installed in parallel. Preliminary investigations are motivated to explore the operating characteristics of the novel experimental facility under different conditions and to quantitatively discover the system improvement potentials for further optimizations. After the steady-state operation evaluation, the system is investigated by varying the heat source temperature and heat sink temperature as well as the working fluid pump stroke. The constant expander isentropic efficiency scenario is simulated through the combination of the expansion valve and cooler, and it is also validated by the installed expander. Results show that the power output of the system and electricity consumption of the working fluid pump are in the ranges of 2.42-3.55 kW and 0.44-0.49 kW, respectively, and the system thermal efficiency varies from 5.2% to 7.3%. Moreover, the system is then deeply explored by using exergy analyses to reveal the potential for performance improvement. The conventional exergy analysis tells that the evaporator has the largest exergy destruction. However, the advanced exergy analysis gives a more realistic improvement potential and suggests that the expansion process should be firstly improved.

AB Accurate wind speed prediction possesses a significant impact on reasonable scheduling and safe operation of power system. For this purpose, a novel hybrid approach based on multi-scale dominant ingredient chaotic analysis, improved hybrid GWO-SCA (IHGWOSCA) algorithm and extreme learning machine (ELM) is proposed for multi-step short-term wind speed prediction, in which the multi-scale dominant ingredient chaotic analysis combines the proposed optimal variational mode decomposition (OVMD), singular spectrum analysis (SSA) and phase space reconstruction (PSR). To begin with, the mode number and updating step of VMD are pre-determined by center frequency observation method and the proposed least-squares error index (LSEI), thus decomposing the non-stationary wind speed series into a set of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Later, the extraction of the dominant ingredient and residuary ingredient for each sub-series is implemented by SSA for the construction of forecasting components. Subsequently, the proposed IHGWOSCA algorithm coded with discrete integers and real-valued are investigated to search optimal parameters in PSR and ELM successively. Lastly, the ultimate forecasting results of the original wind speed are calculated by accumulating results of all the predicted components. Furthermore, seven data sets from Sotavento Galicia and Inner Mongolia have been employed to evaluate the proposed approach. The results illustrate that: (1) the proposed OVMD-based models obtained better RMSE, MAE and MAPE indexes comparing with the benchmark models through weakening the non stationary of the original signal; (2) the proposed dominant ingredient chaotic analysis combining SSA and PSR enhanced the multi-steps prediction performance effectively; (3) the proposed IHGWOSCA optimization algorithm possessed good capability for optimal parameters searching and fast convergence.

AB A conceptual design of a thermosyphonic Magnetohydrodynamic power generator is presented and its performance is numerically investigated. A simplified two-dimensional model of generator is considered. Liquid gallium is selected as working fluid. The left wall and right wall of thermosyphon are at constant temperature T-h and T-c, (T-h > T-C) respectively. Other walls and baffle are insulated. A constant magnetic field is applied horizontally. Separate pairs of electrodes are considered to conduct the generated current. A proper magnetic field reference is introduced to nondimensionalize the governing equations. A numerical code based on the finite volume technique is developed to solve the unsteady governing equations for a laminar natural convection flow. The effects of the Rayleigh number (Ra), Hartmann number (Ha), aspect ratio (Ar) and electric efficiency (K) on the thermo-fluid behaviour throughout the thermosyphon, on the induced electric current density, and on the generated power are investigated. Increasing the aspect ratio and Hartmann number, causes to decrease the natural convection effects, and reduces the Nusselt number. While increasing the Rayleigh number augments the effect of natural convection and consequently the generated power (W*), electric current density (J*), and electric field (E*) increases. It is seen that for a given Rayleigh number, there is a Hartmann number, an aspect ratio, and an electric efficiency, for which the generated power, W*, becomes maximum. For a given Rayleigh number and aspect ratio, it is shown that the generated power does not monotonically varies with Ha. It decreases by increasing Ha from certain values.

AB In this study the continuous production of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) and triacetin from crambe oil and methyl acetate (MA), without the use of catalysts, was investigated. The effects of the oil to MA mass ratio, reaction temperature, addition of water (in the oil) and a two-step reaction on the formation of the products were determined. The results indicated that increasing the availability of MA in the reaction medium had little influence on the FAME yield. An increase in the temperature enhanced the formation of esters and triacetin in the initial minutes of the reaction; however, as the reaction proceeded thermal decomposition was observed, mainly at 350 degrees C. The sample composition revealed a high level of decomposition of linoleate and linolenate esters. A higher FAME yield was obtained with 10 wt% of water added to the oil (similar to 53%), as well as with the application of a two-step reaction (similar to 58%).

AB Wind energy is becoming the fastest growing and most inexpensive renewable source, even surpassed natural gas. The environmental advantages coupled with the significant financial benefits have created a positive prognosis for wind energy continuously growing. However, the complexity and limited availability of wind resources create challenges that need to be addressed in order to continue improving wind energy harvesting. This paper developed a new concept to modify wind farm's layout by deactivating selected wind turbines to maximize its total power output under different wind conditions. Different wind conditions create different wake effects, while most wind farms cannot change their layouts to cope with the changing wind conditions. Through deactivating selected wind turbines to effectively reduce or eliminate some turbulent wakes, it is possible to improve a wind farm's total power output by creating a net gain for the entire wind farm. A new method was developed to identify the best combinations of deactivated wind turbines under different wind conditions to achieve maximum power output. Several case studies with real wind farms and real wind conditions were conducted together with sensitivity analysis. The promising results demonstrated the effectiveness of the new method and the new concept, named layout optimization through selective deactivation. Several factors were identified as influencing factors on the effectiveness of the new concept.

AB A solid-desiccant coated heat exchanger (DCHE) technology can be applied to many heat transfer/exchange systems such as air-conditioners, heat pumps, adsorption chillers, and atmospheric water harvesters. Although the existing mathematical models can sufficiently predict the performance of the DCHEs, they are inapplicable for designing a new DCHE as the heat and mass transport coefficients used are derived from pre-determined empirical correlations. Therefore, in this paper, we developed a new mathematical platform to simulate the simultaneous heat and mass transfer phenomena that occur during DCHEs' dehumidification/regeneration processes. Unlike existing models, the current model considers fluid flow, temperature, and moisture distributions across different domains. The effectiveness of the model was established by validating the performance of silica gel and composite polymer coated heat exchangers under different cooling and hot water temperatures. The maximum discrepancies between the model predictions and experimental data for outlet air humidity ratio and temperature were +/- 14% and +/- 12% respectively. A parametric study was then conducted to investigate the effects of key characteristic properties and fin-tube configurations on dynamic performance of DCHE. The respective dehumidification performance of two tube-fin and annular-fin DCHE configurations was observed to record 7% and 40% improvement in moisture removal capacity over the single-fin tube configuration.

AB One of the most promising technologies employed for biological wastewater treatment and biogas production in recent years is the fluidized bed bioreactor, in which microorganisms immobilized on an inert particle surface convert organic effluents to biogases like methane and hydrogen at high rates. In order to ensure an appropriate biofilm thickness, it is important to know the hydrodynamics of these bioreactors. This study is focused on the investigation of the hydrodynamic characteristics of cylindrical and tapered fluidized bed reactors and evaluation of the influence of hydrodynamic variables on biofilm formation using Computational Fluid Dynamics tools. The Eulerian-Eulerian two-phase, transient, turbulent flow model was simulated in a cylindrical fluidized bed and also in 2.5 degrees and 5 degrees tapered fluidized beds, under conditions found in anaerobic fluidized bed bioreactors. Simulations were performed for a wide range of liquid superficial velocities using two-dimensional axisymmetric meshes. Results indicated that the tapered fluidized beds are superior to conventional cylindrical fluidized beds since a more uniform axial distribution was obtained, thereby providing a more stable operation. Better re rates and a more uniform distribution of energy dissipation rate were observed for the 2.5 degrees tapered fluidized bed operating under 7.83 cm/s. These characteristics induce the formation of particles with uniform biofilms. The tapered fluidized bed with a 5 degrees taper angle operating under low superficial velocities provided lower energy dissipation rates, which can result in a lower erosive effect acting on the biofilm, generating thicker biofilms. Results presented in this paper emphasize the importance of using more sophisticated models, which can predict the details of the flow. These models enabled the identification of the geometric and operational conditions that can improve the operation of fluidized bed bioreactors.

AB Solar organic Rankine cycle (SORC) is a promising approach for solar energy utilization under low and moderate temperatures due to low investment and small-to-medium scale. The stable output of the SORC system under variable solar irradiation conditions is necessary to weaken the impact on the power grid and provide a base load. A novel operating mode was designed to obtain the stable output of 1 MWe for a SORC system operated under variable solar irradiation for 1 day. The parabolic trough collector was selected for solar heat reception, and a two-tank direct thermal storage unit was used for heat storage. Given the variations in solar irradiation, the mass flow rate of the heat transfer fluid (HTF) in the solar collectors was adjusted to guarantee a constant HTF inlet temperature for the ORC unit, and the mass flow rate of the HTF from the hot tank to the ORC unit was kept constant. Thus, the SORC system could operate under stable conditions. Four organic working fluids and two cycle types were subjected to thermodynamic analysis and parametric optimization. Results show that as the HTF inlet temperature increases, the optimal efficiency of system with non-recuperative cycle and toluene increases, whereas those of systems with non-recuperative cycles and cyclohexane, hexamethyldisiloxane, and pentane as working fluids first increase and then remain constant. The increment in the superheat degree increases the efficiency of the system with recuperation. By contrast, the system with non-recuperation demonstrates the maximum system efficiency in the absence of or at a low superheat degree. The maximum system efficiency reaches 17.9%. The system efficiency of this novel operating mode is 4.2% higher than that of an unstable output operating mode when operated for 1 day.

AB Independent solar energy systems are an alternative solution for remote areas that are rich in solar resources but difficult to connect to large power grids. The scheduling ability of a concentrating solar power plant with a thermal storage system is better than that of a photovoltaic plant; however, the high investment limits its application compared with a photovoltaic plant. Therefore, an integrated energy system is proposed in this paper. A combined heat and power unit and a concentrating solar power plant are assembled together to improve the thermal energy utilization. Buildings integrated with phase change materials are designed for heating and cooling storage; they provide energy savings of indoor loads and facilitate the efficient operation of conventional units. In addition, the coordinated day-ahead scheduling of the integrated system is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming model given as the minimization of operation cost. The case studies compare several energy supply modes with different forms of electricity and heating supplies. Results are in favor of the coordinated approach that shows better cost-effectiveness and development potential of the proposed energy supply mode.

AB Due to rise in solar energy applications, research in Photovoltaic (PV) systems is increasingly taking precedence. Ideally, one requires an accurate model of the PV based cell/module so as to theoretically investigate the performances of various control schemes. In this work, a novel hybridized optimizer, hybridized interior search algorithm (HISA), has been explored for effective parameters estimation of PV cell/module. Single and double diode-based models of PV cell/module have been estimated from their respective single I - V nonlinear characteristic using experimental data from five case studies comprising of two cells and three modules using mono crystalline, multi-crystalline and thin film-based PV technology. Additionally, based on used model and PV technology specific insights on new bounds for parameter estimation are investigated. Modeling performance of HISA has been assessed using root mean square error (RMSE), weighted RMSE and mean absolute error, between computed and experimental data. A comparative study with the 34 recent published works, in reported five case studies including analytical, deterministic and metaheuristics-based methods, revealed that HISA based parameter estimation is superior. Therefore, based on the presented detailed investigation, it is concluded that the proposed HISA is a promising optimization technique for PV cell/module estimation.

AB A smart hybrid power plant comprising a waste-fired CHP (combined heat and power) plant accompanied by a small-scale organic Rankine cycle was recently designed and analyzed thermodynamically. The objective of this hybridization is to maximize the share of electricity production of waste-CHP plants rather than a higher heat production rate in a cost-effective manner. In this work, utilization of the exergy of the hot flue gas of the waste fired CHP unit in order to increase the potential of the organic Rankine cycle for maximizing the net power output of the hybrid cycle is proposed and techno-economically analyzed. In addition, the effect of using alternative environmentally-friendly organic working fluids on the performance of the system was investigated. The results of the study show that by the flue gas potential utilization of the same CHP unit, the size of the organic Rankine cycle may increase significantly, leading to a larger power output of the plant. As such, the net exergy and energy efficiency values of the combined plant in various operational conditions are improved compared to its primary configuration by, respectively, about 10% and 20%, when both of the main CHP cycle and the organic Rankine cycle are working at nominal load. In addition, this exergy utilization is beneficial economically as well, decreasing the payback period of the parallelization project by about 10% (from 7.4 years to 6.7 years). The alternative organic working fluid does not make a significant change in the technical and economic performance indices of the system.

AB Solar thermochemical cycle is considered a promising strategy for hydrogen production. The reaction process and oxygen carrier (OC) are the key issues for solar hydrogen production. In this study, a solar-driven chemical looping steam methane reforming (S-CL-SMR) process by using perovskite as the oxygen carrier is proposed. In this process, the heat required by the endothermic reduction is supplied by solar heat, and the heat is converted into the chemical energy of solar fuels. Perovskites La1-yCayNi0.9Cu0.1O3 were synthesized and characterized. Meanwhile, the reactivity was studied via thermogravimetry-analysis at 400 degrees C for reduction, and 900 degrees C for re oxidation. The results show that the reactivity of the La1-yCayNi0.9Cu0.1O3 is improved as the calcium substitution increases. In the reduction reactor, the fractional oxidation of La1-yCayNi0.9Cu0.1O3 reaches to 0.61, and the methane conversion is about 52% with 60% CO selectivity. In the steam reactor, oxygen vacancies and reduced metal ions (Ni2+ and Cu2+) in doped perovskites can provide more active sites to break chemical bonds of H-O. It is found that La1-yCayNi0.9Cu0.1O3 has the best reactivity, regenerability and high resistance to carbon deposition among the synthesized perovskites. Our study is expected to provide a promising potential for hydrogen production by mid-temperature solar heat.

AB Ultra-thin silicon solar cell is a kind of good cost-effective energy solution. Moreover, nanostructured front surface and all-back contact design have been proposed as the promising methods to make ultra-thin silicon an effective solar irradiance absorber. Different nanostructures result in the different generation rate distributions and surface recombination, even though their corresponding integrated generation rates are the same. In addition, under the effect of carrier lifetime, the different generation rate distributions determine the number of carriers that reach the electrodes. Therefore, the grating nanostructures with three different section shapes are chosen for the investigation of the coupling effects of the different generation rate distributions and recombination caused by nanostructures. After consideration of the effect of the surface enhancement ratio of nanostructure, the deviation of electrical characteristics (fill factor), which is caused by the different generation rate distributions caused by nanostructures with the same integrated generation rate, is 0.20% at most as the effective surface recombination increases. Meanwhile, as the carrier lifetime decreases, the deviation of electrical characteristics (short circuit current) is only 1.80% at maximum and does not change with carrier lifetime. Therefore, it is found that, in all-back-contact ultra-thin silicon solar cell, the different generation rate distributions caused by nanostructures with the same integrated generation rate have little effect on the electrical characteristics, no matter how the effective surface recombination and carrier lifetime change. Based on the conclusion, a simplified method is developed for the electrical characteristics simulations. As the effective surface recombination and carrier lifetime change, the minimum error of electrical characteristics calculated by the simplified method is 0.06%, and the maximum is just 3.10%, which proves its accuracy.

AB Highly efficient conversions and utilizations are long-standing topics of interest in energy field. Owing to the unique potentials of metamaterial in regulating thermal and electrical behaviors, classical research on efficient energy utilization has been further motivated. However, current investigations are mostly implemented with single basic transformation, which lead to the simple functions on single field. Hence, hybrid functions are of particular importance in achieving highly efficient devices for multiple energies. In this paper, the above concerns are addressed with hybrid maps to design a class of novel discrete source array, which significantly reconfigures each field generated by an excited source into arrayed distributions. The expected energy collection and allocation are first exhibited only with one single source, and intense convergences/divergences are observed in tailored directions. Contrasts reveal that such designs robustly act as circular source arrays with multiple sources. The findings provide a novel function of efficiently manipulating and allocating energy generated by excited sources, which see potentials in conventional applications, such as extensive harvesting strategies with local energy focus, light routing on the sun-facing side of solar cells, and thermal-electric devices.

AB Evaluating the feedstock requirement of biomass-fed district heating systems is important when planning their installation or expansion. Public acceptance, which favors or deters the utilization of biomass, could be impacted by feedstock supply logistics. Feedstock requirement of district heating plants depends on the heat demand from the consumer and biomass quality characteristics, which vary over time. Previous studies on utilizing biomass for district heating mostly assumed average feedstock quality characteristics and aggregated heat demand values without considering their daily variations. While using average quality characteristics provides the average feedstock requirement of the plant, the actual requirement may vary significantly from the average value when daily variations in quality characteristics are considered. Not including these variations could lead to in-feasibilities in meeting the heat demand of the plant. This study assesses the feedstock requirement of expanding a district heating plant considering daily variations in biomass quality characteristics and heat demand. A Microsoft Excel-based simulation model with one-year planning horizon and daily time steps is developed for the assessment. The costs and CO2-eq emissions of using different feedstock types are evaluated with and without trucking limitations. The developed model is applied to a real biomass-fed district heating plant at the University of British Columbia, Canada. The capacity of the heating plant is planned to be expanded from 6 MW to 18 MW. Three feedstock types, namely, wood residues, pellets and briquettes, and a mix of them are assessed. The results suggest that when enough trucking capacity is available, the plant would receive 2-9 truckloads of wood residues or 1-3 truckloads of pellets/briquettes. The expansion could reduce the total CO2 emissions by about 11,000 tonnes compared to those emitted by the 6 MW (current) biomass-fed heating capacity and natural gas (for a total of 18 MW) when sufficient biomass is available to the plant. However, when trucking is limited, using only wood residues could cause biomass shortage for almost half of the year and result in more emissions due to natural gas consumption. Utilizing energy dense feedstock, such as pellets and briquettes, could mitigate the effects of limited trucking, though, the total fuel cost could increase by 76% and 58%, respectively, compared to using only wood residues. Using a mix of wood residues and pellets/briquettes could achieve a reasonable trade-off between emission reduction and unit fuel cost.

AB A primary challenge towards the adoption of Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) on a wider scale involves the extraction of maximum power irrespective of variation is source and loading condition, commonly referred to as Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT). The non-linear voltage current relationship and dynamic variation of maximum extractable power with change in operating parameters makes MPPT task quite challenging. Motivated by the need to achieve MPPT over a wider operating range with reduced computational burden, this paper proposes a non-iterative approach for maximum power extraction from PEMFC. Continuous estimation of resistance across the source and load by monitoring the voltage and current, allows reducing the deviation between equivalent resistance across the PEMFC terminals and its internal resistance by regulating the Pulse Width Modulated DC-DC converter. The power converter for MPPT is designed with the objective of simultaneously minimizing the ripple content and achieving faster dynamic response. The proposed approach is compared with the Incremental Resistance Method (INR), in terms of simplicity, MPP efficiency and better dynamic response for both source and load perturbations. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme has been validated experimentally.

AB Pumps running as turbines are suitable hydraulic machines for micro hydropower applications. The selection of the proper pumps to install in a given site still remains a major challenge, as pump manufacturers do not provide the characteristic curves data in the turbine mode. Also, the accurate prediction and modelling of the pumps running as turbines characteristic curves still remain a major difficulty as existing methodologies still lack accuracy, especially in the part load and full load operating regions. This paper proposes a new two-step methodology based on the Hermite polynomial chaos expansion for predicting the characteristic curves of pumps running as turbines and modelling their variable speed operation, aiming at improving the prediction accuracy. Firstly, bivariate continuous surrogate functions are established for predicting the turbine mode and the extended operation mode characteristic curves inside a closed interval of unit specific speed values. These surrogate functions are developed by calibrating empirical coefficients based on collected experimental data. Secondly, a hill chart model is determined for describing the variable speed operation of a given pump running as a turbine. This hill chart model allows identifying the discharge and the rotational speed set points for maximising efficiency for a given operating condition. The proposed prediction surrogate functions and the variable speed hill chart model are useful engineering tools for improving the design of pump as turbine hydropower plants and for optimising the pump running as turbine control settings to maximise the produced energy.

AB The contamination of producer gas with tars from biomass gasification remains a significant challenge in the bioenergy industry and a critical barrier, limiting the commercial applications of biomass gasification. Non thermal and non-equilibrium plasma offers an unconventional and emerging technology for the effective reduction of problematic tars from gasification. In this study, we investigated plasma reforming of naphthalene as a two-ring tar model compound using a gliding arc discharge (GAD) reactor with/without steam. The influence on the plasma conversion of naphthalene based on the inlet naphthalene concentration, discharge power and steam-to-carbon ratio was examined to understand the effects of these operating parameters on the destruction of tar, gas selectivity/yield and energy efficiency. Adding H2O in the plasma process generates oxidative OH radicals, creating additional reaction routes for the step-wised oxidation of naphthalene and its fragments towards the CO, CO2 and water. The optimum ratio (2.0) of steam-to-carbon was identified to achieve the highest naphthalene conversion (84.8%), C2H2 yield (33.0%), total gas yield (72.2%) and energy efficiency (5.7 g/kWh). The effect of the amount of steam on the plasma reduction of tars was dependent on the balance between two opposite effects due to the presence of steam: positive effect of OH radicals and the negative effect of electron attachment on water molecules. Introducing an appropriate amount of steam to the plasma reduction of naphthalene also substantially minimized the formation of by-products and enhanced the carbon balance. Plausible reaction mechanisms for the plasma decomposition of naphthalene were proposed through a comprehensive analysis of gaseous and condensable products combined with plasma spectroscopic diagnostics.

AB Neospora caninum is an apicomplexan protozoan parasite that is a leading cause of abortion in cattle. Detection of parasite-specific DNA by PCR is a highly sensitive method for identifying the presence of N. caninum in a variety of tissues. We developed and validated a probe-based real-time PCR assay targeting the conserved Nc5 gene of N. caninum. Using N. caninum strain Nc-1 genomic DNA and a synthetic gene fragment as amplification standards, we determined the PCR amplification efficiency and the limit of detection to be 95.60% and 3 copies, respectively. Five pathogens frequently associated with bovine abortions, namely bovine viral diarrhea virus types I and II, bovine alphaherpesvirus-1, Chlamydia, and Leptospira, were tested to ensure analytical exclusivity. A total of 103 clinical samples from aborted fetuses were tested concurrently with a standard conventional PCR and the new probe-based real-time PCR assay. All tested samples showed 100% agreement between these two assays. In conclusion, the probe-based real-time PCR assay facilitates accurate and rapid detection of N. caninum from abortions in cattle.

   QUESTIONNAIRE
AB Anthelmintic resistance is widespread in equine cyathostomin populations across the world, and with no new anthelmintic drug classes in the pharmaceutical pipeline, the equine industry is forced to abandon traditional parasite control regimens. Current recommendations aim at reducing treatment intensity and identifying high strongylid egg shedders in a targeted treatment approach. But, virtually nothing is known about the effectiveness of these recommendations, nor their applicability to different climatic regions, making it challenging to tailor sustainable recommendations for equine parasite control. This study made use of a computer model of the entire cyathostomin life-cycle to evaluate the influence of climate and seasonality on the development of anthelmintic resistance in cyathostomin parasites. Furthermore, the study evaluated the impact of recommended programs involving selective anthelmintic therapy on delaying anthelmintic resistance development. All simulations evaluated the use of a single anthelmintic (L.e., ivermectin) over the course of 40 model years. The study made use of weather station data representing four different climatic zones: a cold humid continental climate, a temperate oceanic climate, a cold semi-arid climate, and a humid subtropical climate. Initially, the impact of time of the year was evaluated when a single anthelmintic treatment was administered once a year in any of the twelve months. The next simulations evaluated the impact of treatment intensities varying between 2 and 6 treatments per year. And finally, we evaluated treatment schedules consisting of a combination of strategic treatments administered to all horses and additional treatments administered to horses exceeding a predetermined fecal egg count threshold. Month of treatment had a large effect on resistance development in colder climates, but little or no impact in subtropical and tropical climates. Resistance development was affected by treatment intensity, but was also strongly affected by climate. Selective therapy delayed resistance development in all modelled scenarios, but, again, this effect was climate dependent with the largest delays observed in the colder climates. This study is the first to demonstrate the value of cyathostomin parasite refugia in managing anthelmintic resistance, and also that climate and seasonality are important. This modelling exercise has allowed an illustration of concepts believed to play important roles in anthelmintic resistance in equine cyathostomins, but has also identified knowledge gaps and new questions to address in future studies.

AB Among the meat sources of Toxoplasma gondii, pork is considered important in the epidemiology of toxoplasmosis in the USA. How soon after infection T. gondii forms tissue cysts in pork is unknown. In the present study, eight serologically negative -3 months old pigs were fed mouse tissues infected with VEG (Type III) strain of T. gondii and euthanized 7 (4 pigs) and 14 days (4 pigs) post-inoculation (p.i.). Meat from the right shoulder of each pig was bioassayed in mice for T. gondii tissue cysts by peptic digestion. From each pig, the shoulder muscle was cut at random spots into 5 g, 10 g and 50 g portions. Extreme care was taken to use different scalpels and forceps to minimize cross contamination among 17 samples (6 replicates of each 5 g and 10 g portions and 5 replicates of 50 g). From the four pigs euthanized at 7 days p.i., a composite of -200 g of leftover meat from each shoulder was bioassayed in cats and their feces were tested for oocyst excretion. All eight pigs developed T. gondii antibodies (modified agglutination test, MAT, 1: 80 or higher) and viable T. gondii was isolated from shoulder meat of each pig. All four cats fed pork from excreted T. gondii oocysts. The density of T. gondii, based on mouse infectivity, varied within 5-50 g samples each pig, and between pigs within the same group, day 7 versus day 14 p.i. There were no significant differences in mouse bioassay results obtained with day 7 versus day 14 infected pigs. Overall, the rate of isolation of T. gondii increased with sample size of meat bioassayed. Results demonstrate that tissue cysts are formed early in infection and they are unevenly distributed.

AB Teladorsagia circumcincta is the dominant nematode of sheep in cool, temperate climates. Faecal nematode egg counts (FEC) are widely used to identify the intensity of infection and as a measure of host resistance to nematodes. However due to density-dependent effects on worm fecundity the relationship between FEC and worm burden is not linear. In addition collecting FEC data is challenging on a practical level and there is a need for more reliable markers of resistance. There are two major known mechanisms of immunity to T. circumcincta: IgE against third stage larvae (L3) and IgA against fourth stage larvae (L4), which inhibits parasite growth. In this study salivary IgA responses were measured in over 5000 animals against L3 antigen by Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Antigen-specific IgA levels were negatively correlated with FEC (r = -0.26, SE = 0.02) and were heritable (h(2) = 0.16, SE = 0.04) indicating that they can be used to identify resistant animals suitable for inclusion in selective breeding programs. Antigen-specific IgA responses were not negatively correlated with muscle depth. Our analyses indicate that selection for T. circumcincta L3 antigen-specific IgA is possible without impacting on the production traits for the Lleyn breed.

AB Theileria parva is a tick-transmitted, apicomplexan protozoan found in buffalo (Syncerus caffer) and cattle in eastern, central and southern Africa. The parasite causes a fatal, lymphoproliferative disease in susceptible cattle. Previous studies have shown that the parasites in buffalo comprise a more heterogeneous population than those in cattle, which has led to the concept that the population of parasites circulating in cattle represents a restricted subpopulation of those in buffalo. The present study was undertaken to identify if and where this restriction may occur in cattle naturally infected with parasites from buffalo, by sequencing the T. parva p67 antigen gene from eight buffalo and 12 acutely infected cattle from the same endemic site in Kenya. From 103 sequences, we detected 44 different alleles. Nine alleles were found in both cattle and buffalo, and 17 and 18 found only in the cattle and buffalo populations respectively. Nucleotide and amino acid sequence analyses revealed a similar level of diversity of parasites in both hosts. Principal coordinates and phylogenetic tree analyses did not reveal any clustering associated with the host animals, and the number and degree of mixed T. parva infections was similar in the respective populations. The results suggest that any restriction in the ability of T. parva from buffalo to survive and be transmitted from cattle occurs after entry into and initial transformation of bovine lymphocytes.

AB Previously described models for the free-living and parasitic phases of the cyathostomin life-cycle were combined into a single model for the complete life-cycle. The model simulates a single free-living population on pasture utilising parasite egg output from the horses and localised temperature and rainfall data to estimate infective larval density on herbage. Multiple horses of different ages are possible, each with an individualised anthelmintic treatment programme. Genotypes for anthelmintic resistance are included allowing for up to three resistance genes with 2 alleles each. Because little is known of the genetics of resistance to anthelmintics in cyathostomins, the first use of this model was to compare the effect of different assumptions regarding the inheritance of resistance on model outputs. Comparisons were made between single and two-gene inheritance, where the heterozygote survival was dominant, intermediate or recessive under treatment, and with or without a fitness disadvantage associated with the resistance mechanism. Resistance developed fastest when the heterozygotes survived anthelmintic treatment (i.e., were dominant) and slowest when they did not (Le., were recessive). Resistance was slower to develop when inheritance was poly-genic compared to a single gene, and when there was a fitness cost associated with the resistance mechanism, although the latter variable was the least influential. Importantly, while these genetic factors sometimes had a large influence on the rate at which resistant genotypes built up in the model populations, their order of ranking was always the same, when different anthelmintic use strategies were compared. Therefore, the described model is a useful tool for evaluating different treatment and management strategies on their potential to select for resistance.

AB The outcome of infection with Leishmania infantum in dogs is variable, which is thought to be due to the nature of the immune response mounted by the host. As a consequence, the clinical signs and severity of canine leishmaniosis vary between individual dogs. Host immunogenetic factors might play an important role in determining the outcome of infection. The aim of this study was to examine polymorphisms in innate and adaptive immune response genes, to determine whether any of these were associated with susceptibility or resistance to L. infantum infection. Genomic DNA was obtained from two groups: pet dogs in endemic regions of Europe and a group of Beagles exposed to sand fly infection as part of a vaccine study. Genotyping was performed using a SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) array for selected immune response genes. The first part of the study compared 62 clinical cases with 101 clinically unaffected dogs that were seronegative for Leishmania antibodies. One SNP in the CIITA gene demonstrated a significantly higher minor allele frequency in the case group, compared with the control group at the individual SNP level after permutation, but was not significant after correction for multiple testing. The second part of the study examined 48 Beagle dogs exposed to L. infantum over two transmission seasons. Twenty-seven dogs with a resistant phenotype (no evidence of clinical disease, seronegative at the end of the study period, negative on lymph node culture and only transiently PCR positive in bone marrow) were compared with 21 dogs demonstrating a susceptible phenotype (clinical disease, seropositive, positive lymph node culture and consistently PCR positive in bone marrow). Three SNPs in TLR3, two SNPs in PTPN22 and one SNP in TLR4 and ILIA were associated with the susceptible phenotype in the Beagle group at the individual SNP level after permutation analysis, but were not significant after correction for multiple testing. Further validation of these SNPs is required in a larger cohort of dogs, ideally with extreme phenotypes to confirm an association with the outcome of L. infantum infection.

AB Toxoplasmosis, caused by the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii, is an important disease with worldwide distribution. Infection can occur from ingesting raw or undercooked infected meat, and among food animal species, pork is known to be one of the main sources of meat-borne infection. Here, we present results of the first systematic review and meta-analysis on the global T. gondii seroprevalence in pigs. PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and EMBASE databases were comprehensively searched for relevant studies published between January 1, 1990 and October 25, 2018. We used a random effects model to calculate pooled seroprevalence estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and analyzed data from five continents. We also conducted subgroup and meta-regression analyses to evaluate the effects of geographical and climate variables on pooled seroprevalence rates. Among 1542 publications identified, 148 studies containing 150 datasets were included in the meta-analysis, and comprised 148,092 pigs from 47 countries. The pooled global T. gondii seroprevalence in pigs was estimated to be 19% (95 %CI, 17-22%; 23,696/148,092), with the lowest seroprevalence in Europe (13%; 10-15%) and highest seroprevalence in Africa (25%; 17-34%) and North America (25%; 19-33%). The seropositivity rates in Asia and South America regions were (21%, 16-26%) and (23%; 17-30%), respectively. A significantly higher T. gondii seroprevalence was associated with higher mean annual temperature and lower geographical latitude. The presence of cats on farms was identified as a potential risk factor for T. gondii seropositivity (OR, 1.41; 95%CI, 1.00-2.02). Our findings highlight the importance of pigs as a possible source of human T. gondii infections.

AB Infestations of Rhipicephalus microplus cause significant damage to cattle breeding and their control is primarily based on chemical products. There are extensive reports of efficacy losses of acaricid products over time, as well as resistance of the parasites to them, thereby making it necessary to search for new alternatives. The present work aimed to determine the in vitro and in vivo acaricidal activity of organo-modified siloxanes with and without piperonyl butoxide (PBO) in southern Brazil. For the in vitro test, engorged females of R. microplus were collected and submitted to the immersion test. The formulation containing organo-modified siloxanes was tested at 4 different concentrations: 0.6, 1.0, 2.5, and 5.0%. The lowest dilutions (0.6, 1.0, and 2.5%) were also tested with the inclusion of 10% PBO. The in vivo test was performed by applying 2.5% organo-modified siloxanes, and the addition of 10% PBO was applied by spraying. The results showed high acaricidal activity (100%) in vitro in the concentration of 5% on non-associated forms, and in combinations of concentrations of 0.6, 1.0, 2.5% with PBO. The in vivo results also increased the efficacy with the association of PBO. In view of the current multi-resistance scenario of the R. microplus tick to the different commercially available acaricidal products, this study investigated the use of this product in association with PBO as an alternative to R. microplus control and found positive results. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to use organo-modified siloxanes against ticks.

AB The objective of this study was to compare the effect of non-GMO Saccharomyces cerevisiae fermentation products (SCFP) with that of a halofuginone treatment against Cryptosporidium parvum infection in pre-weaned calves on a commercial dairy farm. A total of 123 neonatal female calves, housed in individual hutches, were enrolled sequentially based on date of birth in 41 blocks of 3 animals each. Calves within each block were allocated to one of 3 treatments: remaining untreated, fed with SCFP (Diamond V SmartCare (R) at 1 g/d in milk and NutriTek (R) at 5 g/d in starter grain) for the first 63 days of life, or treated with halofuginone (0.1 mg/kg/d) for the first 7 days of life. Fecal samples collected on days 4-21 post-partum were examined for both Cryptosporidium oocysts and coproantigen. The presence and intensity of diarrhea were monitored by scoring daily for the first 4 weeks of life. Calves were weighed at 0, 21, 42 and 63 days of age. Almost all calves were Cryptosporidium-positive at least once during the study. Halofuginone significantly reduced the number of Cryptosporidium-positive fecal samples as compared to the two other groups. Based on the coproantigen scores, both halofuginone and SCFP feeding significantly reduced the intensity of Cryptosporidium infection as compared to the untreated group. Diarrhea was recorded in almost all calves at least once. Neither the proportion of diarrheic calves nor the intensity and duration of diarrhea differed among the 3 treatment groups significantly. The mean daily weight gain during the first 3 weeks of life was significantly lower in halofuginone treated calves than in both other groups; however, at the end of the study period the total weight gain did not significantly differ among the 3 treatment groups. In conclusion, the clinical results and weight gains of pre-weaning supplementation with the SCFP were neither better nor worse than the 7-day halofuginone treatment suggesting that the SCFP feeding may be from the clinical point of view a natural alternative measure, instead of halofuginone treatment, in bovine cryptosporidiosis.

AB This article introduces the SWAT-AG (a modified SWAT for agro-hydrological modeling) as an enhanced hydrological model for simulating the hydrological processes in agricultural watershed with shallow water tables. The model is developed based on the framework of the SWAT with significant improvements on describing the interactions of the vadose zone water, groundwater, salt and plant growth. The main features of the SWAT-AG include that it can simulate the close interactions of soil water and shallow groundwater with considering the capillary rise effects; it provides functions to simulate the soil salt movement and salt-stress on plant growth; and it incorporates a balance-based module on a sub-basin scale for shallow aquifer with involving canal seepage and ditch drainage calculation. Model testing and application were conducted in Jiyuan Irrigation System located in the Hetao of upper Yellow River basin, northwest China. The comparison between simulated and observed data showed that the SWAT-AG performed well and obviously better than the original SWAT in simulating the soil water and salt dynamics, groundwater depth fluctuations, and plant growth and water consumption. The results showed that the NSE averagely increased from -17.57 to 0.57 and from 0.71 to 0.79 for soil water storage and leaf area index, respectively, in typical croplands and natural patches. In addition, the effects of shallow groundwater in sustaining the agro-ecosystems were reasonably revealed with the spatial analysis of evapo-transpiration, capillary rise and salt accumulation. The test case proved that the proposed SWAT-AG could efficiently enhance the functionality and practicality of hydrological models for agricultural watersheds with shallow groundwater.

AB Identifying the flood susceptible areas is a vital and substantial element of disaster management for every country to control and mitigate injuries of the natural hazards. The current research presents a framework for the preparation of flood prone areas' maps by the integration of Geospatial Information System (GIS), fuzzy logic, and Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM). To achieve this goal, a spectrum of geophysical, geomorphological, meteorological, hydrological, and geographical criteria have been addressed. Considering the linkage and the interdependencies of the criteria, DEcision-MAking Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) approach are used to form the network of relations among the criteria. Moreover, considering inevitable uncertainty, ambiguity/vagueness of the experts' opinions, fuzzy theory is integrated with DEMATEL to handle the issue. Finally, Analytic Network Process (ANP) are implemented to calculate the final weight of every single criterion. The Kurdistan province, located in the North-West of Iran, is considered as the case study in which numerous flood events has had recently happened. The efficiency of the model is assessed through the area under the curve (AUC) and statistical measures such as the Kappa index. In order to evaluate the produced classified flood susceptibility map, the map of historical flood events in the province is also used. About 85% of validation area is classified as "Very High flood Susceptible" which implies the efficiency of proposed framework for flood susceptibility mapping. Furthermore, for evaluating the functionality of the framework in comparison with traditional approaches, the well-known AHP methodology is implemented too. The validation results demonstrate that the Fuzzy-DEMATEL ANP model (AUC-ROC = 0.938, Kappa = 0.88) has a higher performance accuracy compare to the AHP model (AUC-ROC = 0.918, Kappa = 0.79). Moreover, comparing the proposed and validation model shows that the proposed framework can effectively improve decision makers to provide flood susceptibility maps, and recognize flood susceptible areas in data-scarce and ungauged regions.

AB We explored the feasibility of an improved design of a CO2 leakage monitoring network at a geologic storage site. To effectively represent CO2 pathways, a rule-based percolation model was adopted rather than the rigorous multiphase flow model based on Darcy's equation. Five different monitoring network designs were compared using a few scenarios and multiple correlated random field realizations. The ensemble results showed that given the detection uncertainty across the entire sensor network, regular spacing deployment of sensors is the most effective method when a sufficient number of sensors is available. The results also showed that an aggressive monitoring design based on information of the spatial permeability distribution near the surface can be a viable method when a limited number of sensors is employed. However, such an aggressive design can lead to elevated uncertainty in leakage detectability.

AB Cave monitoring is crucial for the interpretation of climatic and environmental significances of various geological proxies in speleothem. Therefore, the hydrochemical and stable isotopic compositions (delta O-18, delta D, Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca, and Ba/Ca) of karst cave waters during 2005-2016 CE were constantly monitored in Furong Cave, Chongqing City, Southwest China. A comparison with local hydrological conditions led to 4 main conclusions as follows: (1) the Mg/Ca ratio is significantly responsive to the changes in drought/wet conditions outside the cave, which increased in drought years and decreased in wet years, respectively. Seasonal variation of Sr/Ca is more significant than those of Mg/Ca and Ba/Ca ratios. (2) Prior calcite precipitation (PCP), incongruent calcite dissolution (ICD), water-rock interaction (WRI), and pCO(2) of soil and cave air, may account for the changes in trace element ratios in the epikarst, which resulted in a complex variation of element ratios in the cave drip water. In general, WRI in drought years is stronger than that in wet years, and that in low discharge sites is stronger than in high discharge sites. Seasonal variation of Ca(2+)concentration, induced by PCP, exerts significant impact on the evolution of Sr/Ca ratio in drip water. (3) delta O-18 and delta D of drip water are influenced by the "mixing effect", leading to the result that their seasonal variations are less significant than that of precipitation. (4) At least in the study period, the ratios of trace elements in the drip water in Furong Cave mainly reflected the variations of local hydrological conditions (drought or wet) dominated by precipitation. Because of the "mixing effect" of groundwater, high-resolution delta O-18 record (e.g., seasonal and annual) of speleothem in Furong Cave may not be recommendable. However, the delta O-18 is potentially a reliable proxy in speleothems to record the change of rainfall on decadal and longer timescales.

ID GROUNDWATER-FLOW; TOMOGRAPHY
AB Localizing leaks of water and fluids from storage tanks and water reservoirs with geomembranes is an important task for a variety of environmental applications and water resources applications. The minimally intrusive mise-a-la-masse method is used to detect leaks with the current injected inside the reservoir and a return current electrode located remotely. We test a new approach for the inversion of the voltage data using sandbox experiments and numerical modeling. A method similar to the self-potential inversion method is proposed to inverse the voltages recorded around the tank or reservoir. A global objective function with a data misfit term and regularization term is minimized to invert the voltages. In the inversion process, a depth-weighting matrix is used to strengthen the depth resolution of the current source, and the minimum support method is used to avoid oversmoothed results in terms of leak detection. The distributions of electrical current density on the walls of reservoir indicate the position of leaks. The results show that the inversion method with source compaction accurately identifies the location of single leaks. For two separated leaks, there is an obvious bias for the deeper hole and the bias increases with its depth. For three holes, the source compaction method generally identifies the location of the three leaks when their depth ranges are similar. When one of the leaks becomes deeper, localization of the deeper one becomes more difficult. The influence of the size of the leak on the inversion results is also investigated. The inversion algorithm overestimates the depth of small leaks while it slightly underestimates the depth of large leaks. For a leak having the form of a crack, the inversion results using the source compaction method agree with the position of the leak and its shape.

AB Different river networks in nature have distinct features depending on regional constraints; these affect the development of the river network and form different characteristics. The differences in drainage networks help in distinguishing between various network types and understanding natural processes. The aim of this study is to develop a new and simple classification method for determining various river network types based on a critical parameter of river networks, the tributary junction angle. For the analysis, fifty river networks are predefined as five network types (dendritic, parallel, pinnate, rectangular, and trellis networks). The tributary junction angles are calculated for each drainage network type, and then the beta distribution is employed to identify distributional characteristics of the junction angles. Parameter estimates of the beta distribution are used to classify different river networks because the estimates provide classified features of natural processes. Support Vector Machines are then utilized to determine the network classification with the parameter estimates. Furthermore, the results are validated against classification using a different approach with commonly used statistics. The proposed method can clearly distinguish between different network types, except for the rectangular and trellis types. In addition, parameter estimates of the beta distribution indicate differences in drainage network types more clearly than the statistics of the angles. Overall, the parameter estimates of beta distribution have high potential for application to the classification of river networks.

AB Utilizing the readily available, inexpensive, remotely-sensed satellite data products in combination with Markov Chain methods for estimating water levels and discharge anywhere along the vast river networks around the world is one of the most interesting and promising fields in hydrology. This study presents two new extensions of Markov Chain (MC) methods, namely the Online-Markov Chains (O-MC) and Extreme Online-Markov Chains (EO-MC) methods to improve the prediction accuracy. The O-MC method has the advantage of the online implementation of the correct variable states, and the EO-MC method has the advantage of online updating the Markov Matrix (MM) along with the online implementation of the correct variable states. The new O-MC and the EO-MC methods were evaluated using short-term satellites signal predictions for six different case study rivers. The Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis was used to measure the reliability of the new MC-based methods. Each model was developed 1000 times to calculate two indices, namely the 95 Percent Predicted Uncertainties (95PPU) and average distance factor (d-factor). The performances of MC and two extensions of O-MC and EO-MC were also examined for cases where we lack the training data. The Training Percent (TrPr) of the entire dataset gradually decreased from 90% to 1%, and the performance of the models in producing accurate future signals in the non-observed dataset is calculated. The Input Variable Imitation (IVI) problem was considered for the MC-based methods, and the results were compared with the Linear Regression (LR), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), and Radial Basis Function (RBF) regression methods. The results showed that the performance of EO-MC and O-MC are better than the simple MC method. In addition, it is concluded that EOMC and O-MC have very similar performance in the uncertainty analysis and both methods are robust techniques. The main advantage of EO-MC compared with the O-MC method is highlighted when the number of training samples are very low. Finally, considering the IVI problem, the new O-MC and EO-MC methods significantly outperformed the LR, MLP, ELM, and RBF methods.

AB Model selection and model averaging have become popular tools to address conceptual uncertainty in hydro (geo)logical modeling. Within the last two decades, many different flavors of approaches and implementations have emerged which complicate an easy access to and a thorough understanding of the underlying principles. With the many approaches and applications, a variety of terms has been defined, which easily leads to misunderstandings and confusion among the community. Here, we review Bayesian model selection (BMS) and averaging (BMA) as a rigorous statistical framework for model choice under uncertainty. We aim to clarify the theoretical foundations of both methods, their relationship to one another and to alternative approaches, and implications of implementation choices. We further build a bridge to Bayesian model combination (BMC) which turns out to be Bayesian averaging or selection of combined models (BCMA/BCMS). Concluding from our theoretical review, we argue that the goal and the philosophical perspective of modeling should be main drivers when choosing to use the B(C)MS/A toolbox, and we offer guidance to identify the suitable approach for specific modeling goals. With this review, we hope to further strengthen the utility of Bayesian methods in the face of conceptual uncertainty by directing their use into the right channels.

AB Flash floods are among the most devastating natural hazards but the analyses of flash floods are hindered by the lack of hydro-meteorological data. In particular, data issues are critical in ungauged basins. This paper presents an investigation of flash flood modeling using coupled hydrological and hydrodynamic models. Specifically, the TOPography-based hydrological MODEL (TOPMODEL) is employed to obtain the flood hydrograph and the coupled 1D-2D hydrodynamic model MIKEFLOOD is used to simulate floodplain inundation. The methods are tested in the Pajiang River, a mountainous basin in South China. The results show that the TOPMODEL effectively simulates the flood hydrograph and the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficients of the flow rate are larger than 0.80 for both calibration and validation. Also, MIKEFLOOD effectively simulates the flood inundation extent and flooding depth and the BIAS for simulated water level is - 0.004 m. Further, using socioeconomic and historical flood disaster datasets, areas with high flash flood risk are identified. A flash flood risk assessment shows a clear trend of change in the flood hazard and the spatial heterogeneity of the flood vulnerability is significant. A sensitivity analysis of the flood vulnerability to the socioeconomic indicators indicates that cultivated land is the most sensitive indicators, and the population and the construction areas have similar influences. Overall, the coupled hydrological and hydrodynamic models prove effective and can be used in practical applications for flash flood risk mapping.

TI Sensitivity of the response of well-aquifer systems to different

AB Groundwater well can be used as a seismograph or as strainmeter, since the well water level is sensitive to seismic waves and other crustal strains through mechanical coupling between rock and groundwater. The use of the groundwater level in monitoring tectonic strain, however, is hindered by the enigmatic response discrepancy among wells (different responses may be recorded by even closely clustered wells). Therefore, understanding the factors that control the sensitivity of well-aquifer systems in response to different periodic loadings is important. In this paper, we analyzed two closely located wells that show no response to seismic waves and respond differently to earth tides and barometric pressure. We discuss these wells' sensitivity of response to periodic loadings by using the spectrum, barometric response function, tidal response, and slug test methods. Our results show that the different response characteristics are due to the differences in permeability and confinement of the well-aquifer systems. Well-aquifer systems with a low permeability cannot record coseismic responses, even if they can record clear tidal and barometric signals. In addition, periodic loading signals in shallow aquifers will be easily masked by the interference from the surface, for example rainfall or pumping, which diminishes the signal-to-noise ratio of the tectonic activity. Thus, the hydrogeological and tectonic settings are the two key factors that should be considered in choosing a suitable monitoring well location for tectonic strain monitoring.

AB Karst aquifers are geologic media that consist of enlarged solution conduits. The geometry of such conduits is very difficult to delineate and its hydraulic parameters such as hydraulic conductivity (K) and specific storage (S-s) are difficult to estimate. Hydraulic Tomography (HT) shown to successfully map the hydraulic heterogeneity of porous and fractured rock aquifers may also be effective in karst aquifers. In this study, we utilize two synthetic karst aquifers with the Branchwork and Network Conduit Patterns (BCP and NCP) to explore the ability of HT to map conduit patterns and their hydraulic parameters. Prior to the HT analysis, forward models are built to study groundwater flow through synthetic karst aquifers to generate data and to gain insights into flow patterns. Forward modeling results reveal that: (1) flow rates at the outlet of the BCP model is higher than the NCP model even when the same water injection rates are applied at the wells; (2) the location of the injection well has a significant impact on the flow rate at the outlet; and (3) flow lines mainly follow the conduit pattern. These results suggest that the accurate mapping of karst networks is critical. Next, the HT analysis of these data is conducted using a set of six models (BCP and NCP) to map the heterogeneity of different conduit systems under steady state and transient flow conditions. Inverse modeling results reveal that the estimated K maps become more reliable as the number of injection tests and the corresponding monitoring data are increased in the HT analysis. Moreover, the results of the BCP model is closer to the original conduit pattern in comparison to the NCP model. A comparative study of three inverse models with different number of observation wells and assuming the availability of geological data has shown that a more reliable pattern of the conduits can be mapped by adding geological information even when a small number of observation wells are available. Overall, our results confirm the feasibility of HT in detecting major conduits as well as being able to differentiate between the BCP and NCP network types.

AB Determining the spatiotemporal dynamics of surface water in a heterogeneous floodplain is difficult, especially for its surrounding isolated lakes. Seasonal inundation patterns of these isolated lakes can be misestimated in a hydrodynamic model due to their short and erratic appearances. A surface water time series of Poyang Lake having an 8-day revisit frequency with a 30 m spatial resolution from 2000 to 2016 was conducted for the first time. This study was produced with a modified hierarchical spatiotemporal adaptive fusion model (HSTAFM) by integrating both Landsat and MODIS data. Discrepancies between model-based surface water and remotely-sensed surface water were evaluated, and possible causes were discussed. Results show that the modified HSTAFM can better detect the water features of a floodplain, thereby providing more detailed information in an seasonal isolated lake system than the MODIS MOD13Q1 product. With the fusion product, we found that Poyang Lake evidently shrank after experiencing a longer low-water period after the impoundment of the Three Gorges Dam. A large proportion of these discrepancies (averaging 36%) between model-based and remotely-sensed surface water distributed in seasonal isolated lakes, mainly occurred during high-water level periods. Uncertainties in the hydrodynamic model might attribute to smaller defined lake boundaries, bathymetric variations, human disturbance, and unconsidered groundwater recharge/discharge. These results provide a new insight into the temporally continuous and spatially dynamic assessment of simulated surface water, which is essential for the future improvement in the hydrodynamic model.

ID LIFE-CYCLE; LCA; DIFFERENTIATION; WITHDRAWAL; FRAMEWORK
AB Understanding the environmental impacts associated with water-related adaptation measures plays an important role in decision making, as some adaptation measures may not offer environmental benefits compared to traditional water systems. The water depletion index (WDI) is one water stress indicator used to estimate the impacts of water consumption. A dynamic WDI was constructed and employed in this study under climate change scenarios with weather and streamflow modeling. To demonstrate whether adaptation measures can reduce water depletion and to demonstrate how dynamic WDI affects assessment results, Taipei, a highly developed and populated city in Taiwan, was selected as a case study site. Decreased WDI from July to August and increased WDI from September to October were simulated under climate change. This approach implied that when measuring water consumption impacts, the WDI should be applied according to the corresponding time period. Additionally, by substituting 70% of potable water with rainwater in a four-story building, 17.9-159.3 m(3) of the freshwater depletion risk might be reduced every month. As adaptation measures can be long-term strategies and long-lasting infrastructures, a dynamic WDI could provide policy makers with a method to accurately and effectively assess the impacts of applying water-related adaptation measures in response to climate change.

AB The Lhasa River is the largest tributary of the Yarlung Zangbo River, provides up to 85% of the water supply for the city of Lhasa, and has a high ecologic and economic importance. Annual streamflow of the Lhasa River is reconstructed from Juniperus tibetica tree rings. The streamflow reconstruction developed for the southern Tibetan Plateau goes back to 1546 CE and has a R-2 of 0.485. Spectral and wavelet analysis indicates the existence of decadal (34 and 16 years) and interannual (8.1, 5.7, 4.8, 3.8, 3.5, 3.2, 2.7, 2.3 and 2.1 years) cycles that may reflect climate forcings. Lhasa River streamflow is significantly correlated with precipitation over a vast part of the Yarlung Zangbo River basin, and represents streamflow of the upper Yarlung Zangbo River to a certain extent. Lhasa River variation is linked with large-scale climate circulation features, such as the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Asian summer monsoon. Some years of abnormally high and low streamflow are related to ENSO events. Based on the reconstruction, the probability that annual streamflow does not exceed a target defined as the instrumental-period mean was lower (48% non-exceedance probability) than during the instrumental period. This study indicates that the instrumental record does not contain the full range of streamflow, especially the lowest streamflow events, and the reconstruction makes up for this shortcoming. Future water resource supply planning based on the instrumental record and streamflow reconstructions will be able to effectively reduce the risks posed by climate change.

AB Extreme rainfall is the most common cause of flooding and likelihood of such events is found to increase in recent studies. Large scale natural variability, human induced global warming and local atmospheric warming are important drivers of extreme rainfall. Understanding the association of these drivers with extreme rainfall and finding out the most significant physical driver will provide a foundation for risk assessment. This study presents a methodology to investigate the association of extreme rainfall events with physical drivers and to model their dependence structure. The methodology is demonstrated with application to Mahanadi River basin, India. Non-stationary extreme value models with multivariate ENSO index, global average temperature anomalies and local mean temperature anomalies as covariates are fitted at non-stationary rainfall grids of the basin. Statistical modelling confirms localized temperature to be the main driver influencing rainfall extremes. Clausius-Clapeyron (CC) scaling curves relating daily rainfall extremes and local mean temperature are developed at all the grids to obtain insights into warming induced changes in rainfall extremes. Significant deviations from the expected CC scaling behaviour are observed. Daily rainfall extremes show peaks at low (25 degrees C) to medium (30 degrees C) range of temperature, but exhibit a decrease at high temperatures for most of the grids. No change in this pattern of relationship is observed when the extreme rainfall is lagged by 1-9 days with temperature. This time lag is selected based on the concept of residence time of water in the atmosphere. The Copula theory is applied to capture the dependence of annual maximum daily rainfall and temperature extremes. Conditional probabilities of extreme rainfall are estimated by conditioning on local mean temperature values of strongest extreme rainfall events. Comparison of conditional probabilities suggests that stronger rainfall events are occurring at 30 degrees C. This study emphasizes the necessity of understanding the dependence structure of extreme rainfall and local mean temperature.

AB Few studies have fully considered how hydrological inputs and climate influence the linkage between the oxygen isotopic composition of alpha-cellulose (delta O-18(cell)) and their source waters in vascular-plant-dominated alpine peatlands. In this study, in order to test whether delta O-18(cell) can be used as a hydroclimatic indicator, we investigated the relationship between the delta O-18 values of cellulose extracted from the dominant plant species (Carex pamirensis) and those of potential source waters during two growing seasons (from May to September) in the Sahara sand peatland in the southern Altai Mountains. Concurrently, the Roden-Lin-Ehleringer (RLE) mechanistic model was applied to better understand oxygen isotopic fractionation during cellulose synthesis. We found that the meltwater from snow/ice cover and seasonally-frozen soil played a critical role in controlling the hydrological processes in this alpine peatland. The delta O-18 values of both swale water and soil water responded more sensitively to variations in inflow meltwater than did summer precipitation. IsoSource modelling demonstrated that the mean 76-24% split between meltwater and summer precipitation inputs determined the overall isotopic composition of the peatland water. The slopes of the peatland water line (6.38) and meltwater line (6.87) were slightly lower than that of the local meteoric water line (LMWL) (7.72), suggesting limited evaporation from these external water sources due to the relatively high humidity (73-80%) in the studied fen. However, the slopes of the stem water line (4.53) and leaf water line (157) were generally lower than that of the LMWL, indicating that the internal plant waters have experienced isotopic enrichment during transpiration. Interestingly, the variations of delta O-18(cell) (of shoots, stems and leaves) fall within a relatively narrow range ( < +/- 3 parts per thousand), which is mainly attributed to a nearly constant monthly net O-18 enrichment factor (11.13 +/- 1.07 parts per thousand for Delta(Modelled)), together with a smoothing effect. Furthermore, empirical correlation and RLE modeling both showed the co-variation of external source water and cellulose synthesis, demonstrating that the cellulose oxygen isotope composition of C. pamirensis can faithfully reflect variations in soil/swale water. These findings strongly suggest that inflow meltwater is the dominant water source in determining delta O-18(cell), implying that the delta O-18(p) signals of precipitation in the winter half-year (October-April) may be inherited by the delta O-18(cell) values of C. pamirensis at the study site. Therefore, our results provide important insights for the hydroclimatic interpretation of past variations in delta O-18(cell) values in vascular plants in alpine peatlands.

AB Climate change and urbanization are currently leading to a warming of the subsurface worldwide with yet unforeseen consequences for groundwater quality. The temperature-sensitivity of chemical and biological processes suggests that small temperature changes driven by current warming should have a detectable effect on the ecology of aquifers and the composition of groundwater itself, but field observations covering temperatures that are environmentally relevant are sparse. The analysis of a large data set provides field-scale evidence that, within the naturally occurring temperature range between 5 and 20 degrees C, temperature affects the quality of groundwater. A difference in temperature of + 1 K is linked to a 4% decline in oxygen saturation and a pH drop of 0.02 due to the accumulation of carbon dioxide. Further, warmer groundwater shows signs of enhanced mineral weathering and higher concentrations of drinking water-relevant elements such as manganese. The observed trends in groundwater quality are consistent with a temperature-associated intensification of microbial metabolic rates and enhanced organic matter mineralization at warmer temperatures either within the aquifers or in the overlying soils. A times series analysis reveals that soil and groundwater temperatures in the studied area have been increasing at a rate of 0.1-0.4 K per decade -comparable to recent global warming- driving subtle, but distinct changes in groundwater pH and oxygen concentrations. The results confirm, that certain but central aspects of groundwater quality (pH, O-2, pCO(2), Mn, DOC) change due to warming, which may increase the costs for purification when drinking water is produced from groundwater resources and may turn some aquifers uninhabitable for groundwater biota.

AB Predicting the bulk cross-sectional average flow velocity in open channels with submerged vegetation is an important topic in river engineering. Researchers have proposed numerous theoretical and empirical formulae, but the accuracy and physical basis of their solutions still need improvement. This study separates the flow into vegetation layer and surface layer, following conventional two-layer approach, and estimates the average velocities in these two layers separately. In the vegetation layer, force balance equation provides the basement of the estimation. And in the surface layer, we use genetic programming (GP), a data-driven method. A Darcy-Weisbach-coefficient-like parameter is proposed for the surface layer, which is related to other parameters through the GP algorithm. The maximum dissimilarity algorithm (a data-clustering algorithm) is used to separate the existing data sets in the training, validation, and testing groups to feed GP algorithm. Finally, by weighted combination, a new velocity formula with high accuracy and physical basis is proposed for submerged vegetated flow.

AB Groundwater is an important resource for drinking water supply, and is subject to natural variation as well as climate change effects. It has been shown that long-term natural variations of groundwater levels can often be attributed to climatic oscillations. Long-term groundwater level records are rare, but of special importance for the detection of longer, decadal to multi-decadal periodicities, which are vital for predictions of future development of groundwater levels and the distinction between natural variation and climate change effects. We have examined periodicities of nine groundwater level time-series with records of more than 100 years, as well as possible impacts of climatic teleconnections (NAO, AMO and ENSO) with wavelet analysis. The monitoring wells are located in Germany, Netherlands, UK and Denmark and cover different depths to groundwater, different aquifer types and hydraulic conditions. Our results show that all evaluated monitoring wells exhibit significant relations to long-term climatic periodicities of NAO, AMO and ENSO. Among the wells in phreatic porous aquifers, there is a signal damping, which can be related to the thickness of the unsaturated zone. Further, the damping is higher in the lower permeable aquifers and there is less damping in the karstic aquifers compared to the porous aquifers, in spite of a much thicker unsaturated zone.

AB Compound dry-hot events have attracted much attention due to their amplified impacts on water resources, crop productions, and ecosystems. Thus accurate prediction of such events is of critical importance for issuing early warning to make informed decisions. This study proposed to employ a meta-Gaussian model for the prediction of the severity of compound dry-hot events in Southern Africa, based on the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which has been shown to affect these events in this region. To represent the severity of compound dry-hot events, a Standardized Compound Event Indicator (SCEI) was used to integrate both dry and hot conditions. The SCEI was predicted based on the conditional distribution constructed from the meta-Gaussian model, in which the antecedent SCEI (i.e., the persistence) and ENSO (i.e., the external forcing factor) were used as predictors. The 1-month and 3-month lead prediction of compound dry-hot events in Southern Africa was assessed and results showed good prediction performances. The compound dry-hot event during December 2015 in Southern Africa was used as a case study and the proposed approach performed well in predicting the severity and probability of this event, which was likely due to the strong impact of ENSO in antecedent periods.

AB Information on the amount of water held by woodchips in the field is needed to assess environmental risks when they are kept in stockpiles or for inferring their efficiency as denitrifying bioreactors. Reflectometry is a widely used method for estimating volumetric water content (theta) in permeable media, but material-specific calibration functions should be developed. This study aimed at developing relationships between the bulk dielectric permittivity (root epsilon(b)) and theta in woodchips considering their particle size distribution (PSD), temperature (T) and the dielectric permittivity of the dry material plus air (root epsilon(sa)). The root epsilon(b) of fine, medium and coarse PSDs were measured with CS616-L water content reflectometers up to theta of 0.83 cm(3)/cm(3) and at T (degrees C) of 10 degrees, 24 degrees, 37 degrees, 55 degrees and 70 degrees. Calibration equations were developed using a multivariate power law function fitted to the data with a hierarchical Bayesian inference procedure. The best fit (R-2 = 0.96; RMSE = 0.04 cm(3)/cm(3)) was obtained for the fine PSD (root epsilon(sa) similar to 1.09); while medium (root epsilon(sa) similar to 1.09) and coarse (root epsilon(sa) similar to 1.03) PSDs were more influenced by T and the presence of large air voids (R-2 similar to 0.92; RMSE - 0.06 cm(3)/cm(3)). A modified calibration equation independent of PSD (root epsilon(sa) = 1) reduced only slightly the goodness-of-fit (R-2 = 0.90; RMSE = 0.07 cm(3)/cm(3)). The equations developed in this study are well suited for field applications as they cover a wider range of theta than previously published functions and they are applicable within the range of T found in field applications.

AB In this study, several advanced data-driven models are adopted for estimating water table levels in conjunction with a proposed data preprocessing procedure that includes detrending, deseasonalization, normalization, outlier exclusion, and formatting. To verify the proposed strategy, a non-linear auto-regressive exogenous model based on deep neural networks (NARX-DNNs), a long-short term memory (LSTM) model, a gated recurrent unit (GRU) model, and a reference model based on an auto-regressive exogenous (ARX) model are comparatively applied to water table level time series from the Jindo Uisin and Pohang Gibuk monitoring wells (years 2005-2014). To test the developed preprocessing method, estimates with and without the proposed detrending and deseasonalization (DTDS) are compared quantitatively. In the comparative applications, all four models show reasonable prediction accuracies. In addition, it is found that the estimations from the NARX and LSTM models are superior to those of the other models in terms of prediction accuracy, regardless of whether DTDS is adopted. In both data sets, there is water table level depression during 2014 due to drought throughout the entire Korean peninsula. In multiple analyses, stressed aquifer conditions are identified through estimations based on differences between estimates and observations, where the differences are found to be more obvious with DTDS preprocessing. Thus, by using the proposed preprocessing method, hydrologically stressed conditions in an aquifer can be effectively noticed at an earlier stage. The results show that the advanced data-driven models can be more effective when adopted in conjunction with the proposed preprocessing method and successfully utilized for monitoring and management of groundwater resources.

AB A three-dimensional coupled groundwater reactive transport and equilibrium chemistry model is presented that simulates the fate and transport of major salt ions in agricultural groundwater systems that span broad regions. The UZF-RT3D/SEC model amends the base model UZF-RT3D by coupling it with a new Salinity Equilibrium Chemistry (SEC) module to simulate the movement and transformation of major salt ions (calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, sulfate, chloride, bicarbonate, and carbonate) due to advection, dispersion, source/sink mixing, sulfur cycling, redox reactions, precipitation-dissolution, aqueous complexation, and cation exchange. The coupling procedure and the considered reactions make the model applicable for simulating regional-scale agricultural aquifer systems with data efficiency and an acceptable processing time. The model receives flow information from the MODFLOW-UZF flow model, which simulates variably-saturated groundwater flow in an efficient manner over regional scales. For use in agricultural areas, the model also accounts for crop uptake, soil organic matter decomposition, and mineralization/immobilization of carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur species. The model is applied to a salinity-impaired regional-scale (500 km(2)) agricultural area within the irrigated valley of the Arkansas River in southeastern Colorado. It is calibrated and tested against salt ion groundwater concentrations measured in monitoring wells, soil salinity measurements from throughout the region, and total salt loads discharging from the aquifer to the stream network of the Arkansas River. Results indicate that the model represents well the overall magnitude and spatiotemporal trends of soil salinity and groundwater salinity in the aquifer, along with salt loading to streams, and therefore can be used to investigate best management practices for salt remediation. This, along with findings indicating that the inclusion of equilibrium chemistry is vital for producing the correct magnitude of salt ion concentrations and mass loadings, render a tool useful for regional investigation of other highly-salinized aquifer systems.

AB Drought is a recurring natural hazard that significantly affects the economy and environment of large areas worldwide. It is therefore imperative to develop techniques that enable comprehensive monitoring and assessment of drought. Here we propose a novel drought index (Combined Climatologic Deviation Index (CCDI)) that encompasses all the aspects of meteorologic, agricultural, hydrologic and human-induced drought occurrences. Critical to the proposed framework is the concept of combining deviations in precipitation and terrestrial water storage, observed by Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites, from climatologic (normal) conditions as a measure of drought. In order to evaluate the applicability of this new index, it is analyzed over four major river basins in India (i.e. Ganga, Krishna, Godavari and Mahanadi). The propounded drought index (CCDI) has demonstrated its ability to identify drought events and render rational quantification of its severity. Results also depict an improved understanding of holistic drought conditions compared to other available drought indices. Comparison of CCDI with commonly used drought indices highlighted some of the fundamental differences while demonstrating good correspondence with PDSI (r = 0.79) and GRACE DSI (r = 0.94). Further, it is evident that in almost all the river basins there have been at least two drought periods with intensities ranging from D1 (moderate drought) to D4 (exceptional drought). The longest drought period, extending for 36 months, from July 2002 to June 2005, is observed in the Krishna Basin. Results from this study show appreciable reliance on the potential for quantifying droughts using CCDI, which will only improve with better quantification and extended availability of terrestrial water storage observations from the recently launched GRACE-Follow On mission.

AB Among various stream temperature models those based on nonlinear regression frequently attract attention due to their simplicity and small number of required variables. Among such approaches the logistic regression model developed twenty years ago for weekly data is still widely used in various scientific studies that require quick and simple calculation of stream water temperature. The model has been modified a number of times in recent years to capture the relationship between daily stream water temperatures, air temperatures and discharge. In this study, we propose further modifications of the logistic regression model that do not require any additional variables that may be hard to measure. The proposed models capture the relationship between the stream temperature and the declination of the Sun, the air temperature and the discharge from a number of recent observations. The proposed approaches are tested on six rivers located in diverse orographic conditions of temperate climate zones of Europe and USA. Although the proposed models remain very simple, their performances are competitive against the performances of more advanced semi-physical or data-driven models.

AB Large-scale vegetation restoration generally reduces local water yield and influences river ecosystem health. Thus, scientific evaluation of vegetation restoration consequences is necessary for maintaining the stability of the surface water system and water cycle in semi-arid regions. In this study, we compared the efficiencies of different typical grasslands in regulating runoff and sediment yields and proposed feasible suggestions suiting for local environments. Four grasslands, including two Gramineae species (Elymus dahuricus and Bromus inermis) and two legume species (Medicago saliva and Trifolium repens), were tested during a two-year period with simulated rainfall experiments, and using bare land as control. Three replicates were done for each treatment, and fifteen plots with a slope of 20 degrees were constructed. Three indices were used to assess the runoff and sediment yields reduction capacity of the grasslands, including runoff reduction benefit (RRB), sediment reduction benefit (SRB), and soil infiltration rate (SIR). The results showed that RRB and SRB were significantly different (P < 0.05) among treatments across the two-year experiments. The values of SRB increased considerably in the second year. In particular, the values of SRB for E. dahuricus and B. inermis was 98.79% and 98.07%, respectively, while that of RRB was - 11.84% and 4.01%, respectively. The two Gramineae grasslands showed greater effectiveness in sediment reduction and runoff maintenance than the two legume species owing to the dense fibrous roots and higher biological soil crust coverage. Therefore, Gramineae grasslands can be considered as a suitable management practice to achieve the socio-ecological sustainability of the semi-arid areas during vegetation restoration.

AB This study is a review to the special issue on artificial intelligence (AI) methods for groundwater level (GWL) modeling and forecasting, and presents a brief overview of the most popular AI techniques, along with the bibliographic reviews of the experiences of the authors over past years, and the reviewing and comparison of the obtained results. Accordingly, 67 journal papers published from 2001 to 2018 were reviewed in the terms of the features and abilities of the modeling approaches, input data consideration, prediction time steps, data division, etc. From the reviewed papers it can be concluded that despite some weaknesses, if the AI methods properly be developed, they can successfully be used to simulate and forecast the GWL time series in different aquifers. Since some of the stages of the AI modeling are based on the experience or trial-and-error procedures, it is useful to review them in the special application on GWL modeling. Many partial and general results were achieved from the reviewed papers, which can provide applicable guidelines for researchers who want to perform similar works in this field. Several new ideas in the related area of research are also presented in this study for developing innovative methods and for improving the quality of the modeling.

AB One of the main problems of signal processing is the issue of estimation, which consists in reproducing a useful signal on the basis of another one, e.g. one burdened with unwanted interference. The use of classical filtering to eliminate disturbances carries the risk of removing an important part of the information about the useful signal. In order to avoid this phenomenon, optimal filters are used, utilizing the statistical properties of signals. Such a case of consideration concerns the issue of estimation for stochastic systems. An example is the Kalman filter in which the main aspect of research is the differential equation of the state estimate in which there is an amplification factor dependent on the covariance matrix of the estimation error. The value of this factor is determined from the non-linear Riccati differential equation, depending on the characteristics of signals affecting the object under investigation and the measurement. The paper proposes an adaptive algorithm to determine the value of the filter amplification factor which allows to avoid the inconveniences resulting from the need to estimate the characteristics of signals affecting the object under investigation. The presented approach to estimation issues does not require the need to characterize random signals due to the application of the adaptive method of state estimation. The analyzed process refers to an object described by ordinary differential equations with continuous measurements representing the state of pollution of the river using the so-called interpretation "along the characteristics". The method used in the module of the intelligent analytical system allows for quick determination of hard-to-measure parameters of the quality of water in the river and to react to upcoming ecological threats without any delays dangerous for the system.

AB The theoretical examination of the combined effect of water table configuration and heat transfer is relevant to improve understanding of deep groundwater systems, not only in siliciclastic sedimentary basins, but also in fractured rocks or karstified carbonates. Numerical model calculations have been carried out to investigate the interaction of topography-driven forced and buoyancy-driven free thermal convection in a synthetic, two-dimensional model. Effects of numerous model parameters were systematically studied in order to examine their influence on the Darcy flux, the temperature and the hydraulic head field. It was established that higher geothermal gradients and greater model depths facilitate the evolution of time-dependent free thermal convection in agreement with changes of the thermal Rayleigh number and the modified Peclet number. However, increasing water table slope and anisotropy coefficient favor the formation of stationary forced thermal convection. Free thermal convection mainly affects the deeper part of the midline and the discharge zone of the synthetic model. In the examined model basins, the position of the maximum hydraulic head is located within the bottom thermal boundary layer near the recharge zone. This divergent stagnation point underlies a local downwelling zone characterized by underpressure. These simulations draw attention to the importance of understanding the combined effect of forced and free thermal convection in sedimentary basins regarding regional groundwater flow patterns, and temperature distributions.

AB Designing effective management strategies for lake ecosystems requires an understanding of regional differences, interannual variability, and other drivers affecting the availability of nutrients to algae. In this study, generalized additive models (GAMs) based on meteorological factors and geographic location were developed to quantitatively estimate the availability of nutrients to algae (as represented by the ratio of Chlorophyll a (Chl a) to total phosphorus (TP) or total nitrogen (TN)) across 167 Chinese freshwater lakes and reservoirs. This model was then used to produce the first spatial and temporal estimates of Chl a/TP and Chl a/TN within mainland China from 1987 to 2016. The results revealed high spatial variability driven primarily by geographic location, which explained 58.86% of the observed variability in Chl a/TP (41.98% in Chl a/TN). In addition, high interannual variability was driven by annual average temperature for both Chl a/TP and Chl a/TN. These results point to a fundamental challenge in managing regions with high nutrient levels, because these regions also tend to exhibit the strongest interannual variability, such that the impact of changes in management practices will be modulated by meteorological variability. In addition, this study provides regionalization indicators that serve as a quantitative foundation for formulating nutrient ecoregions to better administer lakes and reservoirs in China. It is therefore imperative that models combining meteorological factors with geographic location are further developed to improve the simulation of spatio-temporal variability in the availability of nutrients to algae.

AB In recent years, continuous improvements have been made in weather forecasting and flood prediction with great benefit from Early Warning Systems (EWSs). Despite the continuous quest for innovation from the scientific and user communities, EWSs remain based mostly on hazard forecast, and the information on possible consequences and potential impacts is generally missing.
   In this work, a methodology for quantitative real-time impact assessment for flash floods is presented. The methodology uses a multi-model ensemble approach and considers soil moisture uncertainty. Moreover, the flood forecasting chain, which normally provides only the discharge probability of exceeding a given threshold, is extended to include a fully 2D hydraulic model and a damage estimation model to quantitatively assess impacts in terms of economic losses and the people involved.
   The procedure was tested on recent flood events occurring in Genoa in northwestern Italy. This paper discusses the potential challenges and opportunities offered by this approach in the decision-making workflow in an operational context.

AB Simple models capable of describing spatial and temporal patterns of pollutants are needed to understand surface water quality and to identify the main processes that influence the fate and transport of pollutants. This study combines exploratory factor analysis with multilevel and structural equation modeling to: find spatial and temporal patterns of metal and metalloids in the Ctalamochita River Basin (Argentina); identify the processes responsible for the occurrence of these elements; and, establish relationships between latent variables of different aquatic compartments. For this purpose, the metal and metalloid concentration in different matrices was analyzed at sampling sites along 330 km of the river course, including seasonal variations. Our results indicate that the concentration of natural occurring elements in surface water increased downstream the catchment and during the warm-rainy season, as a consequence of surface runoff and groundwater discharge. In contrast, the spatial and seasonal variation in sediment showed an inverse pattern (negative correlation) compared to surface water. On the other hand, copper, zinc and lead were derived from anthropogenic sources, such as old mining areas and metal industries. Moreover, the input of these metals into the river evidenced a direct effect of surface water on sediment, Overall, the combined use of multilevel model and SEM allowed for a proper description of spatial and temporal patterns of metals and metalloids in the catchment, and successfully highlighted sources and processes influencing metal transport. The proposed methodological framework could be extended to wider spatial scales including nested regions, and could be applied to environmental studies dealing with repeated observations and multiple matrices.

AB Urban residents are becoming more aware of water scarcity issues and paying greater attention to their total water consumption. Simultaneously, perceptions of what is considered drinkable water are also evolving. The present study examines whether attitudinal evaluations of stormwater influence the public acceptance of stormwater that is treated and sourced through managed aquifer recharge (MAR). It was hypothesised that treated stormwater used for non-potable purposes would be more acceptable amongst participants, and that select psychological factors (perceptions, values and norms) would be significant predictors of public acceptance for MAR. Participants (N = 408) took part in an online survey which measured public acceptance of stormwater, social norms, stormwater attitudes, water beliefs and water conservation culture. These factors were experimentally examined across two different types of water use: "drinking water" or "non-drinking water". Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that stormwater end use and selected psychological factors accounted for 79% of variance in acceptance of stormwater. While there was significantly higher acceptance for the use of MAR for non-drinking purposes overall, 'end use' was a weak predictor of public acceptance for MAR. The most important predictors of acceptance were social norms and value-driven attitudes towards stormwater. Results showed that perceptions of approval from important others (e.g. family and friends) and personal moral values were influential in explaining acceptance for stormwater. Interestingly, water conservation culture was a negative predictor of acceptance, where people who believed that conserving water was part of the Australian lifestyle tended to have lower acceptance for a supplemental stormwater supply. These people were more likely to support initiatives encouraging conservation of water use as key to managing water supplies. The findings articulate the need to consider existing public attitudes and norms within communities where alternative resources are proposed, to inform policy and practice.

AB Balancing the multiple purposes of reservoir operation, including the social, economic, and ecological aspects, has become one of the most complicated problems facing the managers and operators worldwide. This paper formulates a detailed mathematical model to optimize the reservoir operation during the flood season, considering the three major operational purposes, i.e. flood control (social purpose), energy production (economic purpose), and management of sediment transport (ecological purpose). The entire formulations conform to a nonlinear programming (NLP) model, which can be solved effectively and efficiently by the Multi-Start Solver from the LINGO software through equivalent transformation. This model is applied to the Three Gorges Project (TGP) in China, which is the world's largest and most complex hydraulic engineering in operation. Three typical flood hydrographs (i.e. dry, normal, and wet scenarios) are selected as model inputs under the three strategies (i.e. design operating rules, increasing the flood control water level (FCWL), and impounding in advance). The trade-offs among these three major operational purposes are quantitatively analyzed. Moreover, phosphorus (P), one of the sediment-associated environmental factors, is introduced for exploring its responses to various scenarios and strategies. Results indicate that a higher fore-bay water level leads to a greater energy production, a smaller flood peak but less sediment and P transports to the downstream. Under the design operating rules, the maximum energy production of the TGP can reach 560,620, and 699 x 10(8) KWh, respectively, in dry, normal, and wet scenarios, corresponding to a flood peak of 25000-27500 m(3)/s, a sediment load of 1517-1999 x 10(4) t, and a P load of 3152-3740 x 10(4) kg to the downstream. Whereas, the maximum sediment loads are 2796,4640, and 5377 x 10(4) t, and the maximum P loads are 4021,5345, and 5784 x 10(4) kg, respectively, in dry, normal, and wet scenarios, corresponding to an energy production of 500-588 x 10(8) KWh, and a flood peak of 38600-52500 m(3)/s to the downstream. In terms of achieving the comprehensive benefits of the TGP, impounding in advance is a better choice than both the design operating rules and increasing the FCWL, for it can increase the energy production and the probability of full refill with almost no increase in flood risk to both the dam and the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River as well as smaller reduction in the sediment and P transports. The formulated detailed mathematical model is a general one that is applicable to a variety of reservoirs owning multiple operational purposes. Moreover, the achievements gained from this paper will provide important references for the managers and operators.

AB Groundwater is one of the most beneficial natural resources worldwide. The main aim of the present study is the mapping of groundwater potential of the Zhangjiamao area in China using two novel hybrid data mining techniques that involve the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) ensembled with teaching-learningbased optimization (TLBO) and biogeography-based optimization (BBO). First, 93 spring locations were identified in the study area, which were randomly divided in the ratio of 70:30 to be used for building models and validation, respectively. A total of 16 spring affecting factors viz., slope aspect, altitude, slope angle, plan curvature, profile curvature, curvature, sediment transport index, stream power index, topographic wetness index, distance to roads, distance to rivers, rainfall, lithology, soil, NDVI, and land use/land cover, were used as input variables. The probability certainty factor (PCF) method was applied for the correlation analysis between spring occurrences and the affecting factors. Subsequently, the ANFIS-TLBO and ANFIS-BBO models were generated to produce groundwater spring potential maps (GSPMs). Finally, the GSPMs were evaluated by using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC). The results showed that the AUROC values for the ANFIS-TLBO model based on the training and validation datasets were 0.866 and 0.905, respectively. In contrast, the AUROC values for the ANFIS-BBO model based on the training and validation datasets were 0.861 and 0.887, respectively. The results of ANFIS-TLBO showed that 25.66% of the study area could be classified into the high and very high groundwater spring potential classes as compared to the ANFIS-BBO model (30.52%). The results of the present study can be useful for groundwater management.

AB Rainfall data scarcity has caused enormous problems in hydrologic and non-point pollution (H/NPS) predictions, as rainfall data represent the key input to watershed models. In this study, the effects of different imputation methods such as the data augmentation (DA) and the expectation maximization with bootstrap (EMB) algorithms on rainfall data scarcity were compared. The effects of different data scarcity rates and periods on model performance and prediction uncertainty were then quantified. Finally, the effects of different imputed data sets on H/NPS results were evaluated with the soil and water assessment tool (SWAT). A real case study in the Daning River watershed, Three Gorges Reservoir Region, China, was evaluated. The results indicated that rainfall data scarcity during low flow periods would result in poorer model performance and larger prediction uncertainty, especially to some minimum values, and the time when the maximum values are more susceptible is the rainfall data scarcity during high flow periods. The repair of rainfall data and the H/NPS model performance obtained by the EMB algorithm are superior to the traditional DA and weather generator performances. This advantage of the EMB algorithm would be more definitive if a specific threshold of data scarcity is reached. It is noted that even if the best algorithm is used, the imputed value is always lower than the peak observed value. This paper reports important implications for the choice of imputation methods and the use of H/NPS models for solving data scarcity problems for watershed studies.

AB This paper presents a new laboratory method to simultaneously estimate K-s and a and n parameters of the van Genuchten (1980) theta(h) from the inverse analysis of an upward infiltration curve measured in a 5-cm high soil column. The method was evaluated on synthetic 1D infiltration curves generated for a theoretical loamy sand, loam and clay soil. The influence of the soil initial condition on the inverse analysis was also studied. Next, an optimization method was presented and tested on eight theoretical soils (from loamy sand to clay). The method was subsequently applied to experimental curves measured on five sieved soils (from sand to clay) packed in 5-cm high and diameter cylinders. The K-s, alpha and n values estimated from the inverse analysis of the experimental curves were compared to those measured by Darcy and the pressure cell method (PC). The initial soil tension, h(i), which had an important influence on the optimization, was fixed to - 6.0.10(5) cm. The optimization method resulted robust and allowed accurate estimates of the actual hydraulic parameters. A close to one relationship (R-2 = 0.99) was observed between the theoretical a and n and the corresponding values obtained with the inverse analysis. Regarding to the experimental soils, significant relationships close to one were obtained between K-s and n (R-2 > 0.98) estimated from inverse analysis and those measured with Darcy and PC. A nonsignificant relationship with slope away from one was found for alpha.

AB Developing hydrologic models based on data-driven approaches (DDA) is very complicated due to the complex nature of meteorological data. For example, a high degree of irregularities, periodicities, jumps, and other forms of stochastic behavior influence the accuracy of river flow forecasting. In this study, M5 model tree (M5Tree) and multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS) models were developed to forecast one and multi-day-ahead river flow. Moreover, ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD), a robust data pre-processing technique, was used to enhance M5Tree and MARS models' forecasting. Also, Mallows' coefficient (C-p), one of the procedures to determine the input variables, was used to obtain the optimum values of hydrological time series. The developed models were validated using two different meteorological stations (e.g., Kordkheyl in Iran and Hongcheon in South Korea).
   Forecasting performance of developed models (e.g., M5Tree, MARS, EEMD-M5Tree, and EEMD-MARS) was evaluated using six different statistical criteria. Comparing the results between standalone and hybrid models indicated that a data pre-processing technique can enhance the performance of standalone models (e.g., M5Tree and MARS). EEMD-MARS model (NSE = 0.819 and RMSE = 7.206 m(3)/s (Kordkheyl station) and NSE = 0.738 and RMSE = 50.426 m(3)/s (Hongcheon station)) outperformed M5Tree, MARS, and EEMD-M5Tree models based on two-day-ahead river flow forecasting in validation stage, respectively. Results showed that EEMD-MARS model was an efficient and robust tool to forecast one and multi-day-ahead (e.g., two, three, and four-day-ahead) river flow.

AB Accurate precipitation estimates are essential for reliable hydrological simulations of fluxes and states. Satellite precipitation products have been widely used for hydrological applications, especially for ungauged regions. The Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) product is starting to provide a new generation of precipitation estimates. This work first evaluates several GPM Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals (IMERG) against gauge-based precipitation over Mainland China for a two-year period (2016-2017), and then explores the feasibility of using GPM to force a lumped hydrological model over 300 catchments of varying size and climate.
   The analysis indicates that IMERG Final run estimates (gauge-adjusted) agree well with gauge-based precipitation at daily scale, while IMERG Early run estimates (near-real time without gauge adjustments) are consistently lower than the rain gauge records. Nevertheless, both Final run and Early run estimates are slightly better than TRMM 3B42 estimates in terms of rainfall detection skill. Moreover, all three products show better skill over humid regions than over high elevation zones.
   When used as hydrological model forcing, IMERG Final and Early estimates provide comparable performances to gauge-based precipitation. However, TRMM 3B42 performs relatively poor in terms of hydrological simulation. Moreover, models generally perform better in humid than in arid areas for all three products. The evaluation sheds light on how IMERG-driven hydrological predictions perform in different regions across China. The findings also indicate the potential of IMERG Early run for flood forecasting and Final run for climatological/hydrological modeling in ungauged or poorly gauged basins.

AB In identifying groundwater contaminant sources, given that the simulation model is computationally inefficient, an ensemble surrogate model is proposed to improve the accuracy and robustness of results. The proposed ensemble surrogate model in this paper consists of the following three individual surrogate models: Kriging, radial basis functions and least squares support vector machines. The Adaptive Metropolis-Markov Chain Monte Carlo method is used to assign weights to the three models. Accuracy and robustness of the ensemble surrogate model were tested on not only conservative contaminants but also contaminants containing chemical reaction. The results indicated that the proposed ensemble surrogate model is an effective method to solve the inverse contaminant source identification problems with a high degree of accuracy and short computation time.

ID SOIL-EROSION; LOESS PLATEAU; LAND-USE; THRESHOLDS; INITIATION; RILL
AB Ephemeral gullies (EGs) are important erosion features that could account for as much as 70% of total erosion on the Loess Plateau of China. However, few quantitative studies have been conducted in the field on the impact and mechanism of upslope sediment runoff in EG erosion processes. A series of field rainfall simulation experiments were conducted on an artificial EG to investigate the impacts of upslope inflow with two flow rates (15 and 30 L min(-1)) and five sediment concentrations (20, 40, 80, 120, and 160 g L-1) on runoff and erosion processes within the EG. The results showed that the lower flow rate of 15 L min(-1) increased soil loss by 26% compared with the higher inflow rate (30 L min(-1)). The lower inflow rate triggered greater sheet or rill erosion, whereas the higher rate mainly strengthened the incision of the main EG channel and led to increasing gully erosion. The channel shoulders expanded laterally very little, especially under the higher flow rate. Inflow sediment concentration had a major influence on EG erosion processes. With increasing sediment concentration, EG erosion and total slope erosion first increased, and then decreased. When sediment concentration exceeded 120 g L-1, the inflow sediment began to be deposited, and 120 g L-1 can be regarded as a critical value of EG erosion. These results are beneficial to establish a soil erosion model and to control ephemeral gully erosion in loess areas.

AB Limestone, dolomite, gypsum, anhydrite, and salt are rocks, which can be dissolved, either by water alone, or in the case of limestone and dolomite more efficiently by water enriched with carbon dioxide. With time, the secondary porosity in these rocks increases substantially, and flow through these soluble rocks becomes very effective and fast. The time period for a substantial increase in secondary porosity ranges from years (salt) to 10,000-100,000 years (limestone, dolomite).
   The temporal evolution of such a soluble rock can be described by numerical models, coupling flow, transport, and dissolution. On the fracture-scale, numerous models describe fingering and wormhole formation in soluble rocks. On the aquifer-scale, numerical models predict preferential flow patterns and a strong exchange-flow component.
   We present results from three-dimensional numerical models describing the evolution of a karst aquifer in its early stage. Our numerical approach, which describes the large aquifer-scale, is capable to simulate the strongly heterogeneous development of secondary permeability in the aquifer. Based on irregularities in the model (e.g. geometry, chemistry, lithology, hydrology), preferential pathways evolve under a catchment-control situation, limiting the inflow into the system through the amount of water available from a catchment. We compare qualitatively our large aquifer-scale results to small fracture-scale results and show that the fingering described by the latter models is driven by similar mechanisms as the preferential growth in the former models.

AB A flood hazard is one of the most common and destructive natural disasters. Flood risk reduction with non-engineering measures has become the primary goal for flood management. This paper proposes an approach to improve the flood control operation for cascade reservoirs by minimizing flood control risk. A framework of reservoir flood control operation coupled with risk assessment (RFCORA) and the corresponding RFCORA model are proposed to reduce risk. The model contains three sub-modules. A real-time reservoir flood control operation simulation module is developed, in which a flood discharge control chart is used to determine the flood magnitude, and flood release is obtained by operation rules. Entropy-weighted fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method is applied to assess the risk level in the flood risk assessment module. Finally, the flood release is updated according to the developed outflow adjustment optimization module aimed at minimizing flood control risk by combing future inflow information. In addition, another model without outflow adjustment optimization is set to be a comparative experiment. The water system of the Upper Yellow River is selected as a case study to verify the model. The results show that the framework and RFCORA model developed in this paper can decrease the time duration in the highest risk level without increasing the maximum water level and maximum outflow of reservoirs. The approach proposed in this paper based on flood control operation and flood risk assessment can be extended to flood mitigation in other water systems in similar situations.

AB Reference evapotranspiration (ETo) is a variable of great importance for several purposes, such as hydrological studies and irrigation scheduling. The FAO-56 Penman-Monteith (FAO-56 PM) equation is recommended to estimate ETo a given its good accuracy. However, the estimation of ETo poses a challenge when the availability of meteorological data is limited since the FAO-56 PM equation requires data on temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation and wind speed. This study evaluates, for the first time, the performance of alternative equations, artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM), for the estimation of daily ETo across the entirety of Brazil using measured data on temperature and relative humidity or only temperature. Two strategies, not yet used in Brazil, were used to develop the ANN and SVM models: (i) the definition of groups of weather stations with similar climatic characteristics, using the K-means clustering algorithm, to develop models specific for each group; and (ii) the addition of previous meteorological data as input for the models. Data from 203 weather stations distributed across Brazil were used. The ANN and SVM models showed higher performances than the equations that were studied, even when they were calibrated. The evaluated strategies (clustering and previous days) provided considerable performance gains. For the temperature-based models, the best performance was obtained by the ANN developed with the strategy of clustering and the use of data from two previous days as input; however, due to the similar performance and greater generalization capacity, the ANN developed without clustering and with the use of data from four previous days is recommended. For the temperature- and relative humidity-based models, the ANN developed with data from four previous days was the best option.

TI Using storage of coal-mining subsidence area for minimizing flood

AB Floods are one of the most devastating natural disasters, especially in the midstream plain area of the Huaihe River Basin (HRB) in China, where it is densely populated. This region has suffered from serious backwater flood problems due to its topography and geomorphology. Additional storage space is critical for this region in order to control flood. The middle reach of the Huaihe River is a coal-rich region. The large subsidence areas caused by coal mining may help reduce the issue of insufficient flood storage space, and therefore evaluation of the flood storage capacity in the subsidence areas becomes necessary. A distributed coupled surface water - groundwater model, MODCYCLE, was redeveloped to simulate the interaction between the rivers, the water in the subsidence areas and groundwater. The model was used to simulate maximum flood storage capacity in the subsidence areas and the ability to reduce flood peaks. Two scenarios were created for land subsidence conditions in 2010 and 2030 where typical flood events in 2003 were used. It is revealed that for the 2010 scenario, there was flood overflow even with the maximum storage space used, whereas for the 2030 scenario, the subsidence areas could completely contain the flood water, and therefore eliminate the backwater flood problem. Compared with the 2010 subsidence scenario, the water levels in the depressions can also be significantly reduced in the 2030 subsidence scenario. Our results, from an integrated hydrological modeling's perspective, suggest that using the subsidence areas caused by coal mining for flood storage has the potential to alleviate the problem of backwater flood in the study area, and in the meantime provides an alternative management approach for handling the subsidence areas.

AB Data of open water evaporation (E-ow), such as evaporation of lake and reservoir, have been widely used in hydraulic and hydrological engineering projects, and water resources planning and management in agriculture, forestry and ecology. Because of the low-cost and maneuverability, measuring the evaporation of a pan has been widely regarded as a reliable approach to estimate E-ow through multiplying an appropriate pan coefficient (K-p). K-p is affected by geometry and materials of a pan, and complex surrounding environment variables. However, the relationship between K-p and different environment variables is unknown. Thus, this study chose China D20 pan as an example, used meteorological observations from 767 stations and introduced the latest PenPan model to analyze the sensitivity of K-p to different environment variables. The results show that, the distribution of annual K-p had a strong spatial gradient. For all the stations, annual K-p ranged from 0.31 to 0.89, and decreased gradually from southeast to northwest. The sensitivity analysis shows that for China as a whole, K-p was most sensitive to relative humidity, followed by air temperature, wind speed and sunshine duration. For 767 stations in China, K-p was most sensitive to relative humidity for almost all the stations. For stations north of Yellow River, wind speed and sunshine duration were the next sensitive variables; while for stations south of Yellow River, air temperature was the next sensitive variable. The method introduced in this study could benefit estimating and predicting K-p under future changing environment.

ID SYSTEM
AB Proven in situ treatment and remediation approaches are limited for low-permeability aquifers materials, particularly because of limitations to the delivery of reactive chemicals or access to contaminated plumes. In this paper, we describe the development of a cutting-edge solution for the remediation of contaminated groundwater in a low-permeability and low water-bearing aquifer contaminated with the chlorinated hydrocarbon trichloroethylene (TCE). The remediation technique introduced coupling of large-diameter permeable reactive barrier wells (PRB wells) with: (1) extraction wells through in a highly impacted plume; and (2) re-injection wells at the fringe of the plume. A pump-and-treat system (PTS) was employed at the site in a separate plume to reduce the mass of TCE near the second source zone. This research focuses only on the large diameter PRB well system. Conceptual site model development, design considerations, implementation and performance evaluation demonstrated how each of these elements were applied in the field. Approaches for coupling technologies to increase technical and economic feasibility are presented. Extraction and reinjection wells of treated groundwater at the fringe of the plume promoted a positive hydraulic gradient, facilitated groundwater transport through the reactive media, and contained the plume. Detailed geospatial and statistical analysis with over 10 years' monitoring data showed that dissolved TCE plume delineation shrank, and still concentration continues to decline, and were projected to meet the demands of remediation compliance regulations in the next few years. The results of this study indicate that significant remediation was achieved despite the challenging hydraulic conditions of the aquifer. The developed the remediation technology and conclusions indicate the system's usefulness at other sites.

AB The anticipation of flash flood events is crucial to issue warnings to mitigate their impact. This work presents a comparison of two early warning systems for real-time flash flood hazard forecasting at regional scale. The two systems are based in a gridded drainage network and they use weather radar precipitation inputs to assess the hazard level in different points of the study area, considering the return period (in years) as the indicator of the flash flood hazard. The essential difference between the systems is that one is a rainfall-based system (ERICHA), using the upstream basin-aggregated rainfall as the variable to determine the hazard level, while the other (Flood-PROOFS) is a system based on a distributed rainfall-runoff model to compute the streamflows at pixel scale. The comparison has been done for three rainfall events in the autumn of 2014 that resulted in severe flooding in the Liguria region (Northwest of Italy). The results obtained by the two systems show many similarities, particularly for larger catchments and for large return periods (extreme floods).

   Effect of different uncertainty sources

DE Bivariate flood frequency analysis; Data resolution; HBV; Precipitation
   distribution; Uncertainty assessment
ID PERFORMANCE; CALIBRATION; RAINFALL
AB Flood estimates needed for designing efficient and cost-effective flood protection structures are usually derived using observed peak discharges. This approach neglects, firstly, that floods are characterized not only by peak discharge but also by flood volume, and, secondly, that these characteristics are subject to modifications under climate and land use changes. Bivariate flood frequency analysis based on simulated discharge time series makes it possible to consider both flood peak and flood volume in design flood estimation. Further, this approach considers changes in discharge characteristics by using discharge series generated from climate time series used as an input for a hydrological model. Such series are usually not available at an hourly resolution but at a certain aggregation level (e.g. 24 h) and might not perfectly represent observed precipitation distributions. In this study, we therefore investigate how the aggregation and distribution of precipitation series and discharge distribution affect flood peaks and volumes and their dependence. We propose a framework for assessing the uncertainty in bivariate design flood estimates that is caused by different factors in the modeling chain, which consists of precipitation-discharge modeling, flood event sampling, and bivariate flood frequency analysis. The uncertainty sources addressed are precipitation aggregation and distribution, parameter and model uncertainty, and discharge resolution. Our results show that all of these uncertainty sources are relevant for design flood estimation and that the importance of the individual uncertainty sources is catchment dependent. Our results also demonstrate that substantial uncertainty is introduced already in the first step of the model chain because commonly used calibration procedures do not take into account the reproduction of flood volumes. Researchers should be aware of such deficiencies when performing bivariate flood frequency analysis on modeled discharge time series and should aim to tailor model calibration procedures to the problem at hand.

AB The interaction between the different components of the water cycle at ecosystem scale is of great interest in hydroecology. Stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen in the water molecule can be used to study these processes quantitatively due to their different physical properties. This study aims at quantifying the contribution of local moisture sources to the isotopic signature of water vapor in the specific estuary system of a coastal lagoon. Here we present a framework of the isotopic composition of the atmospheric water cycle components (water vapor and precipitation) for the coastal lagoon of Venice (Italy) and we discuss the interaction between the atmospheric component and the surface component of the local water cycle, i.e. the atmospheric moisture and the lagoon water. The Venetian Lagoon is an enclosed basin with low freshwater influx, resulting in the presence of large horizontal gradients of the isotopic composition of surface water. This feature allows to determine the sensitivity of the isotopic signal in near surface atmospheric moisture under a range of humidity conditions. We observed that when the lower atmosphere is close to water vapor saturation pressure condition, the isotopic composition of water vapor at the ground appears to be in isotopic equilibrium with lagoon surface water in a range of approximately 6-26 km from the sampling point. On the other hand, under unsaturated conditions, we estimated that lagoon evaporation flux accounts on average for similar to 27% to the daily (06-18 Local Sidereal Time) total evapotranspiration surface flux. This is the first study that discusses the spatio-temporal variability of water vapor, precipitation and surface water isotopic composition for a coastal lagoon, thus including the major components of the local water cycle in an estuarine system with the isotope approach.

AB The Powder River Basin in Montana and Wyoming supplies about 40 percent of coal in the United States. In recent decades, coalbed methane (CBM) extracted from coal beds has become an important source of energy in the United States and other countries. CBM water is the produced water brought to the surface as a byproduct of gas extraction. The use of CBM water from the Powder River Basin for irrigation is limited by its relatively high sodium adsorption ratio so the water has to be maintained in lined retention ponds. The liners can be detached from the pond bed, breached through normal weathering or from extreme weather events, and can wear out with time. Water level changes due to constant and dynamic evaporation and precipitation of rainfalls and snowfalls and refilling by gas companies. The objectives of this study are: (1) to develop and validate a novel uniformness based multi-component algorithm to quantify the areas of water and exposed (not submerged in water) liners of the retention ponds from regular red-green-blue (RGB) images, and (2) to quantify the areas of water and liners of the CBM retention ponds in the Powder River Basin using high-resolution true-color images such as free Google Earth imagery. The multi-component algorithm is composed of a sequence of processes: georeferencing, denoising, RGB to L* a* b* color space transformation, K-mean clustering analysis, intelligent identification of connected component in each class, extraction of water body based on maximum uniformness, extraction of exposed lined zones based on uniformness or least root-mean-square value of RGB, and eventually calculation of water area and exposed line area. Application of the multi-component algorithm to the CBM retention ponds in the Powder River Basin using high-resolution true-color images shows that the algorithm can extract accurately water area and the exposed area of liners from these images of high spatial resolution (0.20 similar to 0.34 m), providing a useful tool to use regular RGB images as a resource for monitoring reservoirs, lakes or artificial small ponds.

AB Intermediate water disturbance (in the form of overflow of surface water and changes in the depth of groundwater) may help to accelerate restoration of degraded riparian forest ecosystems in extremely arid areas and enhance the resistance of those ecosystems to drought. To test this possibility, we selected the lower reaches of the Tarim River in China to analyse monitoring data on vegetation and hydrology spanning a 16-year period, and a 100-year data record of tree rings in Populus euphratica. The results suggested that ecological water conveyance can restore degraded desert riparian forest ecosystems. In the early stages of restoration, the interval between two overflows should not be longer than 3 years. Intermediate disturbance (1-2 overflows a year, each lasting 21-30 days) proved conducive to the formation of a plant community that is both diverse and stable, thereby supporting the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. Both P. euphratica and Tamarix chinensis adopt suitable strategies for using groundwater from different depths to adapt to drought. Based on these results, appropriate disturbance modes related to both surface water and groundwater are proposed for the restoration and conservation of desert riparian forest ecosystems under varying intensities of drought. These modes offer scientific guidance on more efficient use of water and on ecosystem management in similar areas around the world.

TI Determining the independent impact of soil water on forest

   Plateau, China

AB Transpiration (Tr) is influenced by environmental factors, vegetation properties, and anthropogenic management. The effect of environmental factors on Tr are taking place from two aspects: evaporative demand (i.e., potential evapotranspiration, PET) and water supply (i.e., soil water). Soil water is one of the most important factors that limit plant transpiration in terrestrial ecosystems, especially in semi-arid and arid regions. Investigating the relationship between Tr and soil water is crucial for an improved understanding of plant survival strategies and predicting hydrological cycles and water resources under climate change. Although the relationships of soil water and Tr have been widely studied, the independent effects of soil water on Tr are difficult to separate because soil water and PET occur concurrently under natural conditions. This study carried out field observations of sapflow density, meteorological factors and soil water in a black locust (Roblin:a pseudoacacia) plantation in the semi-arid Loess Plateau of China. This information was used to develop a model integrating the daily PET and relative extractable soil water (REW, an index that represents the available soil water): Tr = (0.27 x PET - 0.02 x PET2 - 0.32) x (1 - e(-5.70 x) (REW)). The model fitted the measured data well (R-2 = 0.65 and RMSE = 0.06 mm day(-1)). We found that the daily Tr increased as the REW increased under varying PET levels. Additionally, the independent effects of soil water on Tr were analysed using the factorial experiment analysis method. The REW was manipulated and PET varied naturally during the measurements to separate the independent effects of the REW on Tr. The results showed that Tr increased with the REW during the study period at a rate of 0.53 mm day(-1) per 0.1 REW when the REW < 0.4 and 0.09 mm day(-1) per 0.1 REW beyond the threshold (REW = 0.4). Tr increased by 27.3 mm (43.7%) compared to the controlled Tr (observed PET and lowest REW) due to the effects of increasing REW (ranging from 0.14 similar to 0.81) during the study period (growing seasons of 2015 and 2016). Furthermore, canopy-level stomatal conductance was calculated using a simplified inverted Penman-Monteith equation. The reference canopy-level stomatal conductance (Gsref), which represents the Gs capacity and its sensitivity to soil water, showed an increasing response with increasing REW, which is the possible reason for the Tr dynamics with the REW. Our study provided an improved understanding of the soil water-Tr relationship and predicted effects of climate change on tree water use. Although the method required abundant field observation data, we have provided a feasible method of accurately quantifying the independent contribution of soil water on forest Tr.

AB There is lack of knowledge in assimilation of multi-sensor, multi-modal water temperature observations into hydrodynamic models of shallow rivers, specifically, (a) how does accuracy of shallow river model improve after assimilation of in-situ and remotely sensed temperature observations, and (b) how can data from disparate sensors and sources be assimilated into the prediction model without significant increase in computational burden. Multi-sensor, multi-modal observations used in this study are obtained from in-situ monitoring devices in the river with limited spatial coverage but dense temporal resolution, and from Landsat-7 satellite that has better spatial coverage but limited temporal coverage. Use of remotely-sensed observations from satellites poses the challenge that the physical region represented by satellite data does not directly correspond with the physical domain of the river simulated in hydrodynamic models. Satellites detects the skin water temperature, whereas numerical models estimate the bulk temperature in the surface layer that may be multiple meters in thickness. Furthermore, for rivers narrower than the resolution of satellite data, the temperature of each cell represents the weighted average temperature of land and water. These factors introduce biases into the updated numerical model, thereby impeding appropriate management of temperature, water quality, and aquatic ecology. We implemented an efficient ensemble Kalman filter method using Latin-hypercube sampling to assimilate multisensor water temperature observations into the hydrodynamic model of the Lower Klamath River located in northern California. Assimilation of remote sensing data from Landsat-7 improved the model prediction for the entire river. The average spatial error was reduced from 2.59 degrees C to 0.66 degrees C (i.e., 75% improvement). In-situ data assimilation reduced the error at the observation location, however, error in the water temperature predicted by the updated model reverted in less than two days to the same level as that of an un-updated model. On the other hand, it is not computationally efficient to assimilate all of the available data into the model as they become available. In order to overcome these challenges, in-situ data were adaptively assimilated into the model whenever the error exceeded a maximum allowable error. Adaptive assimilation of in-situ data for the Lower Klamath river application occurred one to three times per day, and reduced the average daily error up to 58% compared to assimilation of in-situ data only once each day.

AB An increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration (CO2) affects stomatal conductance (g(s)). Since g(s) is an important parameter in the Penman-Monteith model (P-M), an accurate estimate of g, can improve the accuracy of the estimation of evapotranspiration (ET) by P-M when CO2 increases. This paper identifies three models of the relationship between g(s) and CO2 (the linear model, L, the hyperbolic model, H, and the modified hyperbolic model, MH), and compares their estimations of ET when they are incorporated into P-M. A two-year experiment which included four levels (400, 550, 700, and 900 mu mol mol(-1)) and three levels (400, 550, and 700 mu mol mol(-1)) of CO2 in 2015 and 2016, respectively, was conducted in order to obtain validation data. Fifty papers that had studied the effect of increased CO2 on g(s), over a 45-year period, were analyzed to obtain calibration data. After being calibrated and validated, each of the three models was in turn included as a component of P-M to estimate ET under increased CO2, followed by the comparison between estimated and observed ET. The sensitivity of P-M to the parameters in three models was also analyzed. Our results show that g, decreased and the reduction rate gradually lessened as CO2 increased. Of the three models, MH gave the best estimate of g(s), having the largest values of the coefficient of determination (R-2), 0.97, the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE), 0.96, and the modified affinity index (d), 0.93, and the smallest values of the root mean square error (RMSE), 0.03, and the Akaike information criterion (AIC), - 47.48. Each of the three models gave different ET results for different levels of CO2 when used as a component of P-M. The MH had better ET estimations than L and H when compared to observed ET across all CO2 concentration levels, with the highest R-2, NSE, and d, and the lowest RMSE and MC. The sensitivity of P-M to the empirical parameters varied among the three models, for instance, +/- 40 and +/- 20% changes of parameter p in L, g(smaxp), and and C-s0 in H, and b in MH resulted in -15 to 4%, -13 to 7%, - 9 to 4%, and - 3 to 3% changes in predicted ET, respectively. Thus, changes of parameter b in MH had minimum effect on predicted ET, indicating greater stability of P-M in ET estimation by incorporating MH. Therefore, using MH to model the response of g(s) to increased CO2 when incorporated into P-M to estimate ET not only represents a more appropriate stomata physiological reaction to higher CO2, but also results in a more accurate estimate of ET, and making the model more broadly applicable.

AB Nowadays, alteration of the natural flow regime is considered one the most widespread and damaging impacts for river ecosystems. Hence, increasing our understanding of large-scale hydrological alteration patterns would help us design more effective water use policies. The present study aims to establish general patterns of hydrological alteration caused by dams on a national level, with Spain as a case study. First, we developed a classification of the natural flow regime of the Spanish river network, which served as the reference to assess the degree of hydrological alteration of 139 altered-river gauges. In addition, using the flow series of the altered-river gauges we defined a set of 7 types of altered regimes (TARs), which allowed the stratification of the analyses. The results revealed that the magnitude and direction of hydrological alteration depended on the natural flow class of the altered rivers. In this regard, major effects of dams on Spanish rivers were related to the modification of the intra-annual variability of daily flow, the magnitude of seasonal maximum and minimum flows and the patterns of high flow events. Our results also showed that the distribution of the TARS partially followed a geographic order, but associations between TARs and natural flow classes were not straightforward. In addition, we highlighted that the nature of the hydrological alteration was independent of the registered dam uses.

TI Approaches for estimating unsaturated soil hydraulic conductivities at

AB The Mualem-van Genuchten model has been widely used for estimating unsaturated soil hydraulic conductivity (K-u) from measured saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s) and fitted water retention curve (WRC) parameters. Soil bulk density (p(b)) variations affect the accuracy of K-u estimates. In this study, we extend the Mualem-van Genuchten model to account for the p(b) effect with p(b)-related WRC and K-s models. We apply two functions (A and B) that relate the van Genuchten WRC model to p(b) and two models (1 and 2) that estimate K-s with various p(b). By combining the p(b)-related WRC functions and K-s models, we develop four integrated approaches (i.e., A1, A2, B1, and B2) for estimating K-u at various p(b). K-u measurements made on five soils with various textures and p(b) are used to evaluate the accuracy of the four approaches. The results show that all approaches produce reasonable K-u estimates, with average root mean square errors (RMSEs) less than 0.35 (expressed in dimensionless unit because logarithmic K-u values are used). Approach A2, with an average RMSE of 0.25, agrees better with K-u measurements than does Approach A1 that has an average RMSE of 0.28. This is because Model 2 accounts for the WRC shape effect near saturation. Approaches A1 and A2 give more accurate K-u estimates than do Approaches B1 and B2 which both have average RMSEs of 0.35, because Function A performs better in estimating WRCs than does Function B. The proposed approaches could be incorporated into simulation models for improved prediction of water, solute, and gas transport in soils.

ID MURRAY-DARLING BASIN; TECHNOLOGY ADOPTION; AGRICULTURE; MARKETS;

AB There has been increasing emphasis by scholars in trying to understand how neighbors influence farmers' decision-making. In Australia, historically there has always been strong anecdotal evidence of peer pressure on irrigators' decisions to not sell permanent water entitlements. This local pressure increased with the advent of the federal government into the Murray-Darling Basin water market to purchase permanent water for the environment from voluntary sellers from 2008 onwards. Selling permanent water entitlements is associated with perceptions about rural community decline. This article formally tests whether a neighborhood effect can be detected in permanent water entitlement selling decisions, using farm survey data across a number of years from the southern Murray-Darling Basin (n = 1462). We hypothesize that the more that an irrigator's neighbors sell permanent water in a given area, the more likely that an individual irrigator will also sell permanant water given a decrease in social pressure. Irrigators' locations were geocoded and locational characteristics (regional socio-economic characteristics, land and water quality) were linked to the survey data covering farm, farmer and water trade characteristics. There was significant evidence of a farmer neighborhood effect, with higher likelihood of permanent water sales occurring in areas where more neighbors had sold permanent water, holding other locational and spatial influences constant.

AB A hybrid numerical, finite differences and semi-analytical/empirical model has been developed to evaluate the spatial and time scale of chemical weathering along a fracture in quartz sandstones. The model is based on the diffusion transport occurring from the bedrock mass toward the fracture walls driven by the SiO2 concentration gradient between water in the bedrock pores (high silica content) and water flowing in the fracture (low silica content). Because of molecular diffusion, intergranular water becomes undersaturated with respect to silica. This promotes dissolution of quartz at grain boundaries and results in a porosity profile decreasing from the fracture walls toward the rock interior. Bedrock individual grains are released and gradually removed by the water flowing into the fracture when a critical value of porosity is reached (Grain Release Threshold, GRT): this process drastically increases the fracture enlargement rate.
   The model outcomes establish a minimum time of 90 ka to reach the GRT. This time is independent of length, aperture and dip of the fracture, but is controlled by parameters such as the initial fracture aperture, water temperature, quartz grain size, and initial bedrock porosity. It is attested that the water flowing in the fracture remains undersaturated with respect to silica over very long timescales (in the order of 10(5) years) and over very long flow paths. In turn, this suggests that the extremely slow reaction between quartz and water is the key-factor for the formation of subterranean karst-like features in quartz sandstone, otherwise silica saturation would be reached after short distances and deep weathering in this lithology would be prevented.
   Finally, the model outcomes were compared to field data from the Gran Sabana caves (Venezuela) and other quartz sandstone weathering landforms elsewhere, showing that dissolution/diffusion in the rock matrix is a reliable mechanism for the formation of these peculiar karst-like features.

AB Southwestern Australia has experienced recent climate change, with an increase in air temperature of 0.6 degrees C and a reduction in mean annual precipitation of -15% since 1970. Along with the warming and drying trends, dramatic declines of streamflow have occurred across the region. However, both forest mortality and an increase in leaf area index have been observed in the southwestern forest, suggesting varied responses of vegetation to climate change. In this study, 30 catchments were analyzed using the Mann-Kendall trend test, Pettitt's change point test and the theoretical framework of the Budyko curve to study the rainfall-runoff relationship change, and effects of climate and land cover change on streamflow. A declining trend and relatively consistent change point (2000) of streamflow were found in most catchments, with 14 catchments showing significant declines (p < 0.05, - 68.1% to - 35.6%) over 1970-2000 and 2001-2015. Most of the catchments have been shifting towards a more water-limited climate condition since 2000. For the period 1970 to 2015, the dynamic of vegetation attributes (land cover/use change and growth of vegetation) dominated the decrease of streamflow in about half the study catchments. In general, a coequal role of climate and vegetation on the decline in streamflow was found in the study, suggesting the importance of vegetation management on future water management and production. Precipitation is predicted to decline in the future; therefore, some forest management intervention is required to maintain forest growth and water supply in the southwest of Australia.

AB Understanding energy exchange between the atmosphere and the Earth's surface is crucial. We observed the patterns of energy exchange between the atmosphere and a subalpine meadow in the Qilian Mountains, northwest China over the period of 2014 to 2016. Annual variations in energy exchange in study area exhibited drastic differences during time periods of frozen soil and non-frozen soil. Specifically, more than 80% and 28% of net radiation (R-n) were converted to sensible heat (H) during the frozen and non-frozen soil periods, respectively, whereas approximately 17% and 35% of R-n were converted to latent heat (LE) during the frozen and non-frozen soil periods, respectively. The non-frozen soil period was divided into the pre-growth period, the growth period, and the post-growth period. The high Bowe ratio (beta) values of the pre-growth period were 4.34, 3.60, and 8.39 in 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. In general, rapid increases in R-n during this period increased the values of H, LE, and soil heat flux (G). The growth period was defined by a low beta value that fluctuated between 0.3 and 0.4. The average beta values for the post-growth period during 2014, 2015, and 2016 were 1.49, 3.12, and 2.37, respectively. The high decoupling coefficient (Omega) for the growth period indicated that the contribution of R-n to LE was greater than that of vapor pressure deficit (VPD). The small value of Omega during the other periods indicated that the effect of VPD on LE dominated that of other factors. The seasonal patterns of energy exchange showed that vegetation phenology is the major factor that affects energy partitioning significantly in the alpine meadow ecosystem in the Qilian Mountains. The annual energy partitioning in the same ecosystem over 3 years was not constant, and climate may be the main factor that influences interannual variations in energy exchange.

AB Determining how wells in fractured crystalline bedrock are interconnected is essential in defining contaminant flow paths and in interpreting water quality data from wells. Although various tracers and geophysical techniques have been used with success, the high cost or logistics may restrict their implementation. This study demonstrates a low-cost technique for identifying fracture connections between wells by combining the dissolved oxygen alteration method (DOAM) with cross borehole hydraulic pumping tests, Following the alteration of the dissolved oxygen (DO) profile in the observation well through bubbler aeration, an interconnected well is pumped, which results in changes in borehole flow in the aerated observation well. The DO profile in the observation well is monitored over time to characterize the changes in borehole flow and identify fractures that hydraulically connect to the pumping well. The method was demonstrated at three test sites in Storrs, Connecticut. Each site has two or three interconnecting wells in fractured crystalline bedrock and varying flow conditions. The DOAM successfully identified interconnecting fractures in wells 15-84 m apart.

AB With the boom of hydropower industry, it has never been more important than now to re-assess approaches to a sustainable hydropower projects management. We evaluated the environmental and economic costs and benefits (namely environmental and economic effects) of implementing different hydrology-based environmental flow restrictions (i.e., environmental flows scenarios) at nine run-of-river power plants involving flow diversions, located at pluvial, nival and stable river reaches in Spain. For each scenario, economic effects were inferred from energy production figures, whereas environmental effects along the bypassed river reach came from the deviations of the ecologically meaningful flow attributes from the unaltered flow regime. We found a linear inverse relationship between both effects, which were the lowest for the pluvial type reaches. Imposing significantly low constant flows resulted into the highest energy production but at the highest environmental costs, whereas the opposite happened when using more complex environmental flow methodologies which also imposed flow fluctuations and annual floods, and restricted ramping rates. The ecologically meaningful flow attributes were not similarly affected in all tested environmental flows scenarios. We present a simple approach to define the environmental flow standards at run-of-river-diversion schemes that guarantee the right balance between rivers conservation and energy production, and which are valid for all rivers sharing similar flow regime patterns. In such definition it is possible to address specific ecological goals by prioritizing the naturalness of certain key flow attributes.

AB Understanding how tropical montane catchments store and release water, and the resulting water ecosystem services they provide is crucial for improving water resource management. But while research in high-elevation tropical environments has made progress in defining streamflow generation processes, we still lack fundamental knowledge regarding water storage characteristics of catchments. Here we explore catchment storage and the factors controlling its spatial variability in seven Paramo catchments (0.20-7.53 km(2)) in southern Ecuador. We applied a field-based approach using hydrometeorological, water stable isotopic, and soils hydrophysical data from a 3 year collection period to estimate the passive (PasS) and dynamic (DynS) storage of the catchments. We also investigated relations between these storages and landscape and hydrometric variables using linear regression analysis. Pass estimates from hydrophysical soil properties and soil water mean transit times were consistent with estimates using streamflow mean transit times. Computed catchment PasS and DynS for the seven watersheds were 313-617 mm and 29-35 mm, respectively. PasS increased directly with the areal proportion of Histosol soils and cushion plant vegetation (wetlands). DynS increased linearly with precipitation intensity. Importantly, only 6-10% of the mixing storage of the catchments (DynS/PasS) was hydrologically active in their water balance. Wetlands internal to the catchments were important for PasS, where constant input of low intensity precipitation sustained wetlands recharge, and thus, the water regulation capacity (i.e., year-round water supply) of Paramo catchments. Our findings provide new insights into the factors controlling the water regulation capacity of Paramo catchments and other peaty soils dominated environments.

AB High spatial resolution soil moisture information is important for hydrological, climatic and agricultural applications. The lack of high resolution soil moisture data over large areas at the required accuracy is a major impediment for such applications. This study investigates the feasibility of downscaling satellite soil moisture products to 1 km resolution. This study was undertaken in the semi-arid Goulbum River Catchment, located in south-eastern Australia. The Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP)-Enhanced 9 km (L3SMP-E) and Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) 25 km gridded (SMOS CATDS L3 SM 3-DAY) radiometric products were compared with in-situ soil moisture observations and a regression tree model was developed for downscaling based on thermal inertia theory. Observations from a long-term soil moisture monitoring network were employed to develop a regression tree model between the diurnal temperature difference and the daily mean soil moisture for soils with different clay content and vegetation greenness. Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface temperatures were used to estimate the soil moisture at high spatial resolution by disaggregating the satellite soil moisture products through the regression model. The downscaled SMAP-Enhanced 9 km and SMOS 25 km gridded soil moisture products showed unbiased root mean square errors (ubRMSE) of 0.07 and 0.05 cm(3)/cm(3), respectively, against the in-situ data. These ubRMSEs include errors caused by measuring instrument and the scale mismatch between downscaled products and in-situ data. An RMSE of 0.07 cm(3)/cm(3) was observed when comparing the downscaled soil moisture against the passive airborne L-band retrievals. The findings here auger well for the use of satellite remote sensing for the assessment of high resolution soil moisture.

AB Increasing pressure on river catchment water resources has heightened the need for real-time monitoring data for water management agencies and users. This study investigates the capability to develop a technical basis for water co-management at the catchment scale. A web application (dashboard) was created that displayed real-time data for weather, soil water, river flow and water quality at high spatial and temporal resolutions, including streamflow and rainfall forecasts. A method to predict stream water temperature was developed and tested using an interactive table for visualisation of complex data. The dashboard was used to provide information and alerting to water users in an agricultural catchment, through the Ringarooma Water Users Group (RWUG) in NE Tasmania, Australia. The dashboard was updated several times per day using telemetry and data platform services, and accessed by RWUG members mainly during periods of low flow when water extraction restrictions can be applied. Irrigators gained an improved understanding of streamflow behaviour in response to weather variability, and water extractions and releases, and developed abilities to voluntarily manage the water resource as three sub-groups. The Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment (DPIPWE) collaborated with the RWUG in this adaptive management approach, as enabled by the Ringarooma River Catchment Water Management Plan, and later informed a new Ministerial Policy for 'Water Resource Management During Extreme Dry Conditions'. Group management was assisted by using alerts sent through the existing DPIPWE text messaging service. Results showed that stakeholder understanding of technical information and scenario implications using the sensor-based dashboard increased capacity of irrigators to make decisions that improve production and social outcomes, while considering environmental values. This study demonstrates that the information provided through the dashboard enabled a high level of community and inter-agency co-operation, demonstrating potential to apply this management approach in other catchments.

AB The nonlinear dynamics of streamflow time series from 667 reference hydrometric stations in North America spanning the pluvial-nival hydrological continuum are explored using minimum embedding dimensions as determined by False Nearest Neighbor (FNN) methods. Simulations using synthetic time series demonstrate that snowmelt dominated time series have lower embedding dimensions than those that are rainfall dominated, and that mixtures of the two processes result in a nearly linear change in the embedding dimension. The majority of the reference hydrometric stations drop below a 1% threshold at a dimension less than 30, showing a high degree of natural complexity in the signals ranging from annual snowmelt to weather-driven pseudo-stochastic systems. A less restrictive threshold, 5% is suggested to be more appropriate for streamflow time series. Time series smoothing impacts the embedding dimension and over-smoothing results in incorrect reductions of embedding dimensions. The relationship of the embedding dimensions to watershed and statistical properties of streamflow record showed the lowest embedding dimensions are restricted to large drainage areas, high elevations, and large mean annual flows and variance, high autocorrelations, and large fractions of the records with only small changes in magnitude. Times series that have a large proportion of consecutive days of equal streamflow typically result in higher embedding dimensions. Mapping of the embedding dimension shows spatial patterns related to the streamflow generating processes and geographical features. The use of embedding dimension resolved different dynamics across the hydrological continuum for rainfall to snowmelt over many climate zones. Changes in the embedding dimension might indicate process changes related to climate variability and change.

AB An important knowledge gap in current urban hydrological models are reliable, generic data about interception storage capacities of small urban plant species. These data are crucial to calculate interception losses and learning their effect on the urban hydrological cycle. This study addresses this knowledge gap through simulating rainfall events in an ex-situ, controlled environment on several urban plant species. Four plant species, Lonicera nitida, Lavandula angustifolia, Pennisetum alopecuroides and a grass mix were selected based on their abundance in urban environments and their morphological differences. Several vegetation characteristics such as height and diameter were altered to create as much variation as possible in the dataset to determine the underlying characteristics influencing the interception storage capacity. Estimating the interception storage capacity of each plant (S-p) using multiple linear regression models, biomass (B-p) was found to be the most important predictor variable for all species. Therefore predictive models to estimate the biomass of an individual plant were developed, using some easy to measure vegetation characteristics. When using the results of these biomass models as input in the storage capacity models, reasonable estimations of interception storage capacity were achieved with mean absolute errors between 17.7 and 40.8%, depending on the model. Extrapolating S-p to a reference area of one m(2) showed that L. angustifolia had the highest interception storage capacity due to its high biomass density, followed by P. alopecuroides, L. nitida and finally the grass mix. As a proof of concept, a mixed modelling approach was proposed to include species not covered in this research in the analysis. The findings in this research can be used to create a firm basis for calculations of intra- and interspecies interception storage capacities, essential for improving current urban hydrological models.

AB The pathway of ion supply from the source to the site of bone deposition in vertebrates is thought to involve transport through the vasculature, followed by ion concentration in osteoblasts. The cells deposit a precursor mineral phase in vesicles, which are then exocytosed into the extracellular matrix. We observed that the entire skeleton of zebrafish larvae, is labelled within minutes after injection of calcein or FITC-dextran into the blood. This raised the possibility that there is an additional pathway of solute transport that can account for the rapid labelling. We used cryo-FIB-SEM serial block face imaging to reconstruct at high resolution the 3D ultrastructure of the caudal tail of the zebrafish larva. This reconstruction clearly shows that there is a continuous intercellular pathway from the artery to the forming bone, and from the forming bone to the vein. Fluorescence light microscopy shows that calcein and FITC-dextran form a reticulate network pattern in this tissue, which we attribute to the dye being present in the intercellular space. We conclude that this intercellular continuous space may be a supply route for ions, mineral and other solute or particulate material to the fast forming bone.

AB High-resolution imaging of hair-cell stereocilia of the inner ear has contributed substantially to our understanding of auditory and vestibular function. To provide three-dimensional views of the structure of stereocilia cytoskeleton and membranes, we developed a method for rapidly freezing unfixed stereocilia on electron microscopy grids, which allowed subsequent 3D imaging by electron cryo-tomography. Structures of stereocilia tips, shafts, and tapers were revealed, demonstrating that the actin paracrystal was not perfectly ordered. This sample-preparation and imaging procedure will allow for examination of structural features of stereocilia in a near-native state.

AB Many integral membrane proteins, just like their globular counterparts, form either transient or permanent multi -subunit complexes to fulfill specific cellular roles. Although numerous interactions between these proteins have been experientially determined, the structural coverage of the complexes is very low. Therefore, the computational identification of the amino acid residues involved in the interaction interfaces is a crucial step towards the functional annotation of all membrane proteins. Here, we present MBPred, a sequence-based method for predicting the interface residues in transmembrane proteins. An unique feature of our method is that it contains separate random forest models for two different use cases: (a) when the location of transmembrane regions is precisely known from a crystal structure, and (b) when it is predicted from sequence. In stark contrast to the aqueous-exposed protein segments, we found that the interaction sites located in the membrane are not enriched for evolutionary conservation, most likely due to their restricted amino acid composition or their random distribution among buried and exposed residues. On the other hand, residue co-evolution proved to be a very informative feature which has not so far been used for predicting interaction sites in individual proteins. MBPred reaches AUC, precision and recall values of 0.79/0.73, 0.69/0.51 and 0.55/0.48 on the cross -validation and independent test dataset, respectively, thus outperforming the previously published method of Bordner as well as all methods trained on globular proteins. Moreover, we show that for the majority of complete interface patches, the method captures more than 50% of the involved residues.

AB Plasma kallikrein (pKal) is a serine protease responsible for cleaving high-molecular-weight kininogen to produce the pro-inflammatory peptide, bradykinin. Unregulated pKal activity can lead to hereditary angioedema (HAE) following excess bradykinin release. HAE attacks can lead to a compromised airway that can be life threatening. As there are limited agents for prophylaxis of HAE attacks, there is a high unmet need for a therapeutic agent for regulating pKal with a high degree of specificity. Here we present crystal structures of both fulllength and the protease domain of pKal, bound to two very distinct classes of small-molecule inhibitors: compound 1, and BCX4161. Both inhibitors demonstrate low nM inhibitory potency for pKal and varying specificity for related serine proteases. Compound 1 utilizes a surprising mode of interaction and upon binding results in a rearrangement of the binding pocket. Co-crystal structures of pKal describes why this class of small-molecule inhibitor is potent. Lack of conservation in surrounding residues explains the similar to 10,000-fold specificity over structurally similar proteases, as shown by in vitro protease inhibition data. Structural information, combined with biochemical and enzymatic analyses, provides a novel scaffold for the design of targeted oral small molecule inhibitors of pKal for treatment of HAE and other diseases resulting from unregulated plasma kallikrein activity.

AB Cryo-Electron Tomography (cryo-ET) has become an essential technique in revealing cellular and macro molecular assembly structures in their native states. However, due to radiation damage and the limited tilt range, cryo-ET suffers from low contrast and missing wedge artifacts, which limits the tomograms to low resolution and hinders further biological interpretation. In this study, we applied the Model-Based Iterative Reconstruction (MBIR) method to obtain tomographic 3D reconstructions of experimental cryo-ET datasets and demonstrated the advantages of MBIR in contrast improvement, missing wedge artifacts reduction, missing information restoration, and subtomogram averaging compared with other reconstruction approaches. Considering the outstanding reconstruction quality, MBIR has a great potential in the determination of high resolution biological structures with cryo-ET.

AB M-proteins (M-Prts) are major virulence determinants of Group A Streptococcus pyogenes (GAS) that are covalendy anchored to the cell wall at their conserved COOH-termini while the NH2-terminal regions extend through the capsule into extracellular space. Functional M-Prts are also secreted and/or releas " d from GAS cells where they exist as helical coiled-coil dimers in solution. Certain GAS strains (Pattern D) uniquely express an M-protein (plasminogen-binding group A streptococcal M-protein; PAM) that directly interacts with human plasminogen (hPg), a process strongly implicated in the virulence of these strains. M-Prt expressed by the emm gene is employed to serotype over 250 known strains of GAS, similar to 20 of which are hitherto found to express PAMs. We have developed a modular structural model of the PAM dimer that describes the roles of different domains of this protein in various functions. While the helical COOH-terminal domains of PAM are essential for dimerization in solution, regions of its NH2-terminal domains also exhibit a weak potential to dimerize. We find that temperature controls the open (unwound) or closed (wound) states of the functional NH2-terminal domains of PAM. As temperature increases, alpha-helices are dramatically reduced, which concomitantly destabilizes the helical coiled-coil PAM dieters. PAMs with two alpha-repeats within the variable NH(2)terminal A-domain (class I/III) bind to hPg tightly, but natural PAM isolates with a single a-repeat in this domain (class II) display dramatic changes in hPg binding with temperature. We conclude that coexistence of two alpha-repeats in PAM is critical to achieve optimal binding to hPg, especially in its monomeric form, at the biologically relevant temperature.

AB Collagen is one of the leading components in extracellular matrix (ECM), providing durability, structural integrity, and functionality for many tissues. Regulation of collagen fibrillogenesis and degradation is important for treating several diseases from orthopedic injuries to genetic deficiencies. In vivo, this process is generally regulated by proteoglycans (PGs), a family of molecules that contain both protein and glycosaminoglycan components. Recently, novel, biocompatible, semi-synthetic biomimetic proteoglycans (BPGs) were developed, which consist of an enzymatically resistant synthetic polymer core and natural chondroitin sulfate (CS) bristles. It was demonstrated that BPGs affect type I collagen fibrillogenesis in vitro, as reflected by their impact delaying the kinetic formation of gels similar to native PGs. To elucidate the interaction and the effect of BPGs on the quality of collagen fibrils, a histological technique, electron tomography, was adapted and utilized to image nano-scale structures in 213 and 3D within the tissue model. BPGs were found to aid in lateral growth and enhance fibril banding periodicity resulting in structures resembling those in native tissue. BPGs attached to collagen despite the lack of a protein core. This interaction was mediated by the CS bristle regions of the BPGs, implying that CS itself is sufficient for PG -type I tropocollagen interactions, in the absence of the protein core, with the overall nanoarchitecture of the molecule serving to affect ECM kinetics. Synthetic mimics are a tool to study non-proteinaceous PG interactions in collagen assembly and warrant exploration as a viable pathway to augmenting molecular repair in collagen type I-rich tissues.

AB The crystal structure of the conserved hypothetical protein Rv2991 from Mycobacterium tuberculosis has been solved by SAD using seleno-methionine substituted protein. The dimeric biological assembly and the sequence and fold conservation are typical of F-420 cofactor binding enzymes. Despite Rv2991 still being of unknown function, sequence and structural comparison with similar proteins enable a role to be proposed for its C terminal stretch of residues in recognizing and orienting the substrate. In addition, the C-terminus is involved in both protein folding and determining the size of the active site cavity.

Currently, the standard protocol of VPP usage periodically changes the VPP position to a fresh spot during data collection. Such a protocol was to target the phase shifts to a relatively narrow range (around 90) based on the observations of increased phase shifts and image blur associated with more images taken with a single VPP position. Here, we report a 2.87 angstrom resolution structure of apoferritin reconstructed from a dataset collected using only a single position of VPP. The reconstruction resolution and map density features are nearly identical to the reconstruction from the control dataset collected with periodic change of VPP positions. Further experiments have verified that similar results, including a 2.5 angstrom resolution structure, could be obtained with a full range of phase shifts, different spots of variable phase shift increasing rates, and at different ages of the VPP post-installation. Furthermore, we have found that the phase shifts at low resolutions, probably related to the finite size of the Volta spots, could not be correctly modeled by current CTF model using a constant phase shift at all frequencies. In dataset III, severe beam tilt issue was identified but could be computationally corrected with iterative refinements. The observations in this study may provide new insights into further improvement of both the efficiency and robustness of VPP, and to help turn VPP into a plug and -play device for high -resolution cryo-EM.

AB The AvrRpt2 protein of the phytopathogenic bacterium Erwinia amylovora (AvrRpt2(EA)) is a secreted type III effector protein, which is recognised by the FB_MR5 resistance protein of Malus x robusta 5, the only identified resistance protein from a Malus species preventing E. amylovora infection. The crystal structure of the immature catalytic domain of AvrRpt2(EA), a C70 family cysteine protease and type III effector, was determined to a resolution of 1.85 angstrom. The structure provides insights into the cyclophilin-dependent activation of AvrRpt2, and identifies a cryptic leucine of a non-canonical cyclophilin binding motif. The structure also suggests that residue Cys156, responsible for the gene induced resistance, is not involved in substrate determination, and hints that recognition by FB_MR5 is due to direct interaction.

AB A new cryo-EM system has been developed and investigated for use in protein electron 3D crystallography. The system provides parallel illumination of a coherent 300 kV electron beam to a sample, filters out energy-loss electrons through the sample with an in-column energy filter, and allows rotational data collection on a fast camera. It also possesses motorized cryo-sample loading and automated liquid-nitrogen filling for cooling of multiple samples. To facilitate its use, we developed GUI programs for efficient operation and accurate structure analysis. Here we report on the performance of the system and first results for thin 3D crystals of the protein complexes, catalase and membrane protein complex ExbBD. Data quality is remarkably improved with this approach, which we name eEFD (electron energy-filtered diffraction of 3D crystals), compared with those collected at 200 kV without energy filtration. Key advances include precise control of the microscope and recordings of lens fluctuations, which the programs process and respond to. We also discuss the merits of higher-energy electrons and filtration of energy-loss electrons in electron 3D crystallography.

AB Amoebiasis is a common parasitic infection in the developing world and is caused by the protist Entatneoba histolytica. The proliferation of E. histolytica and its ability to invade epithelial tissues have been shown in several studies to be greatly decreased during oxidative stress. It is therefore not surprising that this amoeba has evolved several mechanisms to evade oxidative stress. Cysteine is thought to be one of the crucial molecules that help in redox defence, and a de novo cysteine biosynthetic pathway involving serine as one of the substrates has been partially elucidated in E. histolytica. Though most of the enzymes of this pathway in E. histolytica have been characterized, phosphoserine phosphatase (EhPSP), a key regulatory enzyme of the serine biosynthetic pathway, has not yet even been identified. In the current work, we identified and characterized EhPSP using various molecular, structural and functional approaches. The crystal structures of native and substrate-bound EhPSP were determined and showed the residues that play a crucial role in its phosphatase activity and substrate binding. Structural and biochemical studies indicated that EhPSP belongs to the histidine phosphatase super-family. EhPSP-overexpressing amoebic cells were found to be more tolerant to oxidative stress. However, protection during oxidative stress was not seen when a functionally defective mutant was overexpressed. Our results clearly showed that E. histolytica has a functional PSP and that this protein participates in protecting the organism against oxidative stress.

AB Stinging accidents involving wasp venom are a notable cause of acute kidney injury (AKI) in Asia. However, very little attention has been paid to the understanding of the mechanisms involved in this type of AKI. The aims of this review are to explore the evidence for the mechanisms and the therapeutic role of renal replacement therapy of wasp venom and AKI. A systematic literature search was conducted using PubMed for the association among wasp venom and AKI. Wasp venom is a complex mixture of biologically active components, including enzymes, amines, and peptides. Wasp venom may induce local anaphylaxis reactions as well as systemic reactions such as AKI. AKI may develop as a result of direct nephrotoxic effects of the venom or secondary intravascular hemolysis and/or rhabdomyolysis. Histopathological features of renal biopsies predominantly include acute tubular necrosis and acute interstitial nephritis. Renal replacement therapy, which includes intermittent hemodialysis, hemoperfusion, plasmapheresis, continuous renal replacement therapy, and peritoneal dialysis, has been used to treat severe AKI cases induced by wasp stings. Continuous renal replacement therapy appears to provide more benefit than intermittent hemodialysis in the treatment of wasp sting-induced AKI. In this review, we summarize the existing evidence of the mechanisms and treatment for venom-induced AKI, with a particular emphasis on the role of renal replacement therapy in the management of severe AKI following massive wasp stings.

ID IMMUNOGLOBULIN THERAPY; SNAKE ENVENOMATIONS; MANAGEMENT
AB Delayed or recurrent coagulopathy can occur up to 14 days after North American rattlesnake envenomation in patients that have been treated with Crotalidae Polyvalent Immune Fab (CroFab). There is little data in the literature characterizing the sequelae of North American rattlesnake envenomation in pregnancy and no previously published reports of recurrent coagulopathy in pregnancy.
   Case report We present 2 cases of first trimester pregnant women requiring readmission and retreatment with Crotalidae Polyvalent Immune Fab (CroFab) after developing recurrent/late coagulopathy following North American Rattlesnake Envenomation. Both patients were initially admitted and treated with CroFab following snakebite and discharged home without coagulopathy. One patient developed significant hypofibrinogenemia and subsequent hemorrhage after spontaneous abortion secondary to recurrent venom induced hypofibrinogenemia.
   Discussion: Pregnant women with recurrent or late coagulopathy may be at higher risk for hemorrhage and spontaneous abortion and require more frequent laboratory monitoring after initial hospitalization and treatment with antivenom. A lower threshold for re-treatment with CroFab may be warranted in patients with fibrinogen less than 100mg/dL even in the setting of a normal platelet count.

AB Spider venoms are widely recognized as a new emerging source of potential research tools, pesticides, drug leads, and therapeutic agents. Some studies suggest that these venoms may contain interesting vasodilator compounds with potential therapeutic applications. In the present study, the vasodilator activity of the venom of Poecilotheria regalis was evaluated in isolated rat aortic rings. This venom induced an endothelium-dependent vasodilation [EC50 value was 5.52 (4.18-7.32) mu g protein/ml with an E-max = 103.4 +/- 3.8%]. While the percentage of vasodilation induced by the venom was significantly diminished in the presence of a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor (L-NAME), it remained unaltered in the presence of suramin, a P2-purinergic receptor antagonist. Moreover, the vasodilator activity of the venom was not affected after boiling bath incubation, but was significantly decreased under reducing conditions. Additionally, venom composition was analyzed by reversephase chromatography and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, and two fractions were obtained, referred to as peptidic and non-peptidic fractions. Interestingly, both fractions induced vasodilation in isolated rat aortic rings. The results of this study showed that the venom of P. regalis induces a concentration-dependent vasodilation in rat aorta that was endothelium-dependent and involves the activation of NO/cGMP pathway. These results suggest that the venom contains a combination of both peptidic and non-peptidic vasodilator components. This study provides pharmacological data that suggest that P. regalis venom may be an important source of peptidic and non-peptidic vasodilator compounds.

TI Severe coagulopathy in Merrem's hump-nosed pit viper (Hypnale hypnale)
   envenoming unresponsive to fresh frozen plasma: A case report

DT Review
DE H hypnale; Coagulopathy; Fresh frozen plasma; Cardiac arrest
ID RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL
AB The Merrem's hump-nosed viper (H. hypnale) causes many snakebites in South India and Sri Lanka. At present no antivenom is available for envenomings by this snake. A 42-year-old male bitten by a large H. hypnale, presented within 30 min of the bite and had a cardiac arrest soon after admission. This responded to standard advanced life support, but he had an unrecordably high international normalised ratio (INR), activated partial thromboplastin time and unrecordably low fibrinogen, consistent with a complete venom-induced consumption coagulopathy. In the absence of antivenom, a total of 1680ml of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) was transfused 5.5 and 16 h post-bite. The coagulopathy did not improve with the administration of FFP and a further elevation of D-Dimer after FFP suggested consumption of transfused clotting factors. The coagulopathy resolved after 72 h. The patient did not develop any bleeding complications, acute kidney injury or evidence of thrombotic microangiopathy and was discharged 8 days after the bite. This case suggests that early FFP for VICC in H. hypnale envenoming may worsen the coagulopathy in the absence of antivenom and cannot be recommended.

   Necroptosis; Ferroptosis
AB The main important clinical signs in acute kidney injury (AKI) after sever Hemiscorpius lepturus envenomation in patients is associated with proteinuria, hemolysis and hemoglobinuria. Unfortunately, our limited knowledge of molecular cell death mechanism in H. lepturus induced AKI restricts the development of desirable therapeutics. So, in the present study, the potential role of necroptosis and ferroptosis in H. lepturus induced AKI were investigated in male albino mice. The animals were administrated by SC injection of venom (1, 2.5, 5 and 10 mg/kg) based on LD50 determination. After 1 and 7 days, urinalysis, stereological assessments and gene expression of Ngal, Tnf-alpha, Tlr-4, Ripk3, Mlkl and Acsl4 were evaluated by real time PCR. Our data revealed that upregulation of renal Ngal expression is associated with the gene over expression of Tnf-alpha, Tlr-4, Ripk3 and Mlkl in venom treated kidneys. We observed that the Malondialdehyde (MDA) level was increased in dose-dependent manner similar to Acsl4 gene over expression suggesting a main role of ferroptosis in hemoglobinuria mediated AKI following envenomation. Moreover, transcriptional enhancement of Tlr-4and Tnf-alpha receptor can cause phosphorylation of Ripk3-Mlkl complex, collapse of membrane potential and DAMPs release which intensified the inflammation cytokines in kidney. Taken together, it supposes co-existence of two separate pathways of regulated necrosis and inflammatory environment provides a promising outlook in prevention and management of hemoglobinuria induced AKI following envenomation in clinical practice.

AB We report an envenomation to a professional herpetologist by a South American rattlesnake (Crotalus durissus terrificus) that resulted in respiratory failure, and therapeutic improvement following antivenom administration. A 56-year-old male was bitten on the left wrist by a Crotalus durissus terrificus (C. d. terrificus) while attempting to tube the snake for maintaining safe control while performing venom extraction. The patient was intubated due to rapidly ensuing respiratory failure and administration of Antivipmyn-TRI (R) was initiated while being transported via ambulance. The patient was admitted to the hospital unconscious and unresponsive. Mechanical ventilation was required until 5 h after completion of antivenom administration. No significant adverse effects were observed with antivenom administration. The patient was discharged approximately 55 h following envenomation. This is the first reported case in the United States of a patient following a C. d terrificus envenomation with consequent respiratory failure, and in which Antivipmyn-TRI (R) was successfully administered.

AB Snake venoms as well as their components have been tested worldwide to find new molecules for prophylaxis and treatment of several pathologies or even for diagnostic purposes. It is widely known that snake venoms contain enzymes and non-enzymatic proteins that interfere with hemostasis leading to hemorrhage or even thrombosis. The treatment of snake envenoming and the development of new drugs. The thrombin generation test (TGT) is a highly sensitive tool for investigation of hemostatic changes, overlapping with existing coagulometric techniques. The aim of this study was to use TGT to evaluate in vitro hemostatic changes caused by venom of Brazilian snakes B. jararacussu, B. alternatus, B. moojeni and C. durissus terrificus in a normal pool of platelet-poor plasma, comparing results to those obtained by the classical coagulation assays, at the same concentrations of venom. B. moojeni venom showed to be more hypercoagulable, with a greater ability to activate coagulation, evidenced by increased values of Endogenous Thrombin Potential (ETP), even in the reactions in which the triggering reagent (tissue factor) was not added. On the other hand, the lowest ETP values were observed in plasma incubated with C. durissus terrificus venom. As a new finding of great importance, all venoms at the same concentrations assessed by TGT did not promote changes in a pool of platelet-poor plasma by classic coagulometric assays, such as prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), whose results were within the reference range. Thus, TGT showed to be more sensitive than the coagulometric assays to evaluate the hemostatic effect of venom components in vitro. Our preliminary results indicate a potential role for TGT in improving the laboratory investigation of hemostatic changes due to snakebite. In addition, elucidation of hemostatic changes induced by different Brazilian snake venoms related to hypocoagulability or hypercoagulability represents an important approach to improving the treatment of snake envenoming and the development of new drugs.

AB This case report describes the effect of an envenomation by the Beautiful Pit Viper Trimeresurus venustus (or Cryptelytrops venustus), which is a green pit viper native to Thailand and Malaysia. A previously healthy 60-year-old snake breeder with no relevant medical history was bitten by his adult T. venustus in the third finger of his right hand while taking it out of the feeding box. The bite was painful and swelling progressed to include his whole hand within an hour after the bite. He was treated symptomatically with pre-emptive antibiotics and analgesics, never developed any hematological disorders such as coagulopathy and bleeding or disseminated intravascular coagulation and was discharged 26 hours after the bite.
   The clinical course in our patient matched two other well-documented cases reported to our Poisons Centre, and one further case presented as a conference-poster. All patients recovered with symptomatic therapy and never required antivenom. Therefore, bites by T. venustus seem to present with less severe symptoms compared to other Trimeresurus species.

ID INDIGOFERA-SPICATA; AMINO-ACID; CAMEL MEAT; DOGS; RAT
AB Indospicine is a natural toxin occurring only in Indigofera plant species, including the Australian native species linnaei. These perennial legumes are resistant to drought and palatable to grazing livestock including cattle. Indospicine accumulates in the tissues (including muscle) of animals grazing Indigofera and these residues persist for several months after exposure. Dogs are particularly sensitive to indospicine with reports in past decades of hepatotoxicosis and mortalities in dogs after dietary exposure to indospicine-contaminated horse and camel meat. The risk for human consumption is not known, and the current study was undertaken to assess indospicine levels in cattle going to slaughter from divergent regions of Western Australia, and to predict the likelihood of significant residues being present. Muscle and corresponding liver samples from 776 cattle originating from the Kimberley and Pilbara Regions in the tropical north of the state, where I. linnaei is prevalent, and 640 cattle from the South West and South Coast Regions in the temperate south west of the state, where the plant is not known to occur, were collected at abattoirs over four seasons in 2015-2017. Indospicine levels were measured by LC-MS/MS and ranged from below detection to 3.63 mg/kg. No indospicine residues were detected in any of the animals originating from the South West and South Coast Regions. Prevalence of indospicine residues in cattle from the Kimberley Region was as high as 33% in spring and 91% in autumn, with positive animals being present in most consignments and on most properties. The average prevalence of indospicine residues from the Kimberley and Pilbara Regions throughout the survey period was 63%. @Risk best fit probability distributions showed ninety-fifth percentile (P95) indospicine concentrations of 0.54 mg/kg for muscle and 0.77 mg/kg for liver in cattle originating from the Kimberley and Pilbara Regions during the survey period. When considered with average Australian meat consumption data, the estimated consumer exposure from this P95 muscle was 0.32 mu g indospicine/kg bw/day, which compared favourably with our calculated provisional tolerable daily intake (PTDI) of 1.3 mu g indospicine/kg bw/day. However canine exposure is of potential concern, with active working dog exposure calculated to exceed this PTDI by a factor of 25, based on a P95 indospicine concentration of 0.54 mg/kg in muscle.

AB Phoneutria nigriventer spider venom has been studied for more than 40 years and several components with pharmacological potential have been described in it. However, studies on venoms from other species of the Phoneutria genus are scarce. In this work, a conventional cDNA library from the species Phoneutria pertyi venom glands was constructed, aiming to identify novel putative cysteine-rich peptide toxins for the genus Phoneutria. 296 unique sequences were identified and 51 sequences corresponded to putative cysteine-rich peptide toxins. Besides cysteine-rich peptide toxins, other putative venom components such as protease inhibitors, defensins and serine proteinases were identified. Furthermore, by manual curation of the sequences with no match at UniProt, we were able to identify glycine-rich proteins (GRP), a class of venom component never described in Phoneutria genus. This work describes the first complete sequences of toxins from the venom of P. pertyi and reveals that, despite most of the retrieved toxins show a high identity to toxins identified in Phoneutria genus, novel putative toxins remains to be described.

AB Infrared thermography is a technique that quantifies the thermal (infrared) radiation emitted by an object and produces a high-resolution, digital thermal image of it. Medically, this technique is used to visualize the body's surface temperature distribution in a non-invasive, safe, and convenient fashion. However, to the best of our knowledge, the use of infrared thermography for assessing the systemic effects of envenomation by coral snakes has not been reported. In this case report, we describe the use of this technique in the management of a case of snakebite in Sao Paulo, Brazil. A 51-year-old woman was bitten on the back of the right hand by Micrurus frontalis, a species of coral snake, 10 min prior to her arrival at the hospital. Infrared imaging performed at admission revealed elevated temperatures at the bite site and in the elbow, as well as the preservation of a normal distal thermal gradient in both hands. A few minutes later, the patient developed muscle weakness in the upper limbs and in the eyelids, and infrared imaging showed an alteration of the thermal gradient in both hands, reflecting the systemic action of the venom. Following these observations, the patient was treated with the specific antivenom and was discharged 48 h post admission. At the two-week follow-up, the thermal image obtained showed no anomalies, indicating the recovery of the patient. Hence, infrared thermography can be very useful in the early identification of systemic neurotoxicity in cases of Micrurus snake bites, facilitating the decision to prescribe the antivenom.

TI Stingray (Potamotrygon rex) maturity is associated with inflammatory

SO TOXICON

ID BEHAVIOR; DIET
AB Several studies have been carried out with venom from sting and mucus of stingrays of marine or fluvial environments to compare the toxicity of their venom. However, studies demonstrating the existence of the influence of both sex and the maturation stage of stingrays on the variability of the toxic effects of venom are still scarce. Here, we investigated whether the sex and/or the stage maturation of the Potamotrygon rex stingray influence the toxic capacity of the venom to develop acute inflammation in mice. We carried out the main toxic activities in mice using venom from female or male of young and adult stingrays. Our results described here show that the nociception is mainly induced by venom from young female stingrays. In contrast, we observed the action of venom from both sex of adult stingrays in the induction of exudative phase of inflammatory process, including vascular leakage and neutrophil infiltration. Our data illustrate that the composition of the venom of P. rex is influenced by the stage of maturity of the stingray, modulating the production of peptides and proteins capable of acting on leukocytes-endothelial interactions and favoring neutrophil infiltration to the damage tissue.

AB Antivenom for the treatment of bothropic snakebite is a priority for public health institutions from Latin America. An alternative to the conventional antivenom production is based on the use of egg yolk antibodies - IgY-technology - by immunizing laying hens. In this study, we produced, characterized and assessed the efficacy of IgY-based antivenoms against B. alternatus venom. Immunochemical studies (reactivity, avidity and antigen recognition pattern) as well as antivenom efficacy assays were performed. After the 3rd immunization, levels of specific IgY reached a maximum that was maintained throughout the observation period, while avidity indexes of the extracts increased after the successive immunizations. Furthermore, IgY against B. alternatus recognized protein complexes of the venom with high (> 40 kDa), medium (20-40 kDa) and low (< 20 kDa) molecular weights. IgY antivenoms obtained after 8 immunizations neutralized 35.65 mu g of B. alternatus venom per mg of antivenom, while specific activities values ranged from 0.28 to 0.42. In conclusion, we produced and characterized IgY antivenoms capable of neutralizing the lethal activity of B. alternatus venom at a preclinical level. Thus, IgY-technology may allow the production of effective and affordable antivenoms fulfilling the urgent needs of many countries where conventional manufacture is unable to provide enough availability of antivenoms.

AB Calcified disk herniation of the thoracic spine is by no means a rare clinical entity in neurosurgery. We present a 63-year-old woman with a long-standing giant calcified disk in the thoracic spine. Initial imaging studies indicated a differential diagnosis of calcified disk versus meningioma. Given her benign neurologic examination and the presumed morbidity of attempting to resect the lesion, we elected to follow her closely with serial imaging. Over 3 years of consistent follow-up, the lesion has not grown and she has remained free of neurologic changes.

DE Aneurysmal bone cyst; Doxycycline; Spine
AB Aneurysmal bone cysts (ABCs) are among the most aggressive benign bone tumors, often occurring in both long bones and the spine. Treatment remains controversial as recurrence rates continue to be high. Treatment options include curettage with or without bone grafting, arterial embolization, en block resection with or without instrumentation or arthrodesis, radiation, and intralesional drug injections (steroids, calcitonin, doxycycline). We present the case of a patient with a thoracic vertebral ABC who underwent 2 rounds of doxycycline foam percutaneous injections. At the 1-year follow up appointment, all symptoms had been resolved. Repeat computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated that the ABC had nearly filled in completely with new bone. Our case demonstrates successful use of this percutaneous, less invasive method in the management of vertebral ABCs.

TI A Rare Case of Negative-Pressure Hydrocephalus: A Plausible Explanation
   and the Role of Transmantle Theory
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Arachnoid cyst; Hydrocephalus; Low-pressure; Negative-pressure;
   Transmantle pressure gradient
AB BACKGROUND: Negative-pressure hydrocephalus is a rare condition with the development of symptomatic hydrocephalus despite subnormal intracranial pressure (ICP). The etiology remains unclear. Some authors proposed that the differential pressure between the ventricular space and the subarachnoid space over cerebral convexity leads to the development of ventriculomegaly, namely as the transmantle pressure theory.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 49-year-old patient with a left Sylvian fissure arachnoid cyst underwent several surgeries including cystoperitoneal shunts and fenestrations of the cyst. The patient developed a cerebrospinal fluid fistula from the cranial wound was complicated by bacterial meningitis. Consequently, the shunt was removed, and external cyst drainage was placed. After 9 days, the patient developed acute hydrocephalus requiring external ventricular drainage (EVD). Two days later, after overdrainage of the external cyst drain, the patient suffered neurologic deterioration. The ICP measured by the EVD was -4 cm H2O, and a computed tomography scan demonstrated progression of the hydrocephalus. The external cyst drainage was shut off and the EVD level was adjusted to produce between 5 and 10 mL/hour of cerebrospinal fluid under a subatmospheric pressure set at -5 cm H2O, and gradually raised in increments of 1 cm every 3 days until a positive ICP occurred. Once clinical and radiographic stability was accomplished, a programmable ventriculoperitoneal shunt was inserted set to 30 mm H2O. A marked clinical and radiologic improvement was observed in the follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: This negative-pressure hydrocephalus case report supports the main role of the transmantle pressure theory. The subatmospheric EVD method and a low-pressure valve resulted in excellent clinical and radiographic outcomes.

TI Surgical Treatment of Spontaneous Internal Carotid Artery Dissection
   with Abducent Nerve Palsy: Case Report and Review of Literature
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Review
DE Abducent nerve palsy; Cavernous sinus; High-flow bypass; ICA dissection
AB BACKGROUND: Sixth-nerve palsy often develops as a result of trauma, neoplasm, or vascular disease affecting the pons. Less commonly, this palsy can be caused by pathology of the internal carotid artery in the cavernous sinus region. Here, we describe a rare case of spontaneous dissection of the internal carotid artery in the cavernous sinus accompanied by acute sixth nerve palsy that was successfully treated with surgery.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: An 18-year-old man presented suddenly and spontaneously with isolated abducent nerve palsy. His magnetic resonance angiography identified a dissection of the right internal carotid artery in the cavernous sinus. We successfully treated it with high-flow bypass and ligation of the internal carotid artery (ICA).
   CONCLUSIONS: Intracavernous ICA dissection is a possible cause of sixth nerve palsy. While most cases likely result from compromised arterial blood supply to the affected nerve, compression of the cranial nerves by the expanded artery can occur in some cases. Surgical treatment is a safe and effective option for relieving nerve compression after intracavernous ICA dissection.

ID GENDER
AB Several differences distinguish brain functioning and behavior of women and men. This article addresses how gender features influence the way one behaves in the workplace, in particular, in neurosurgery. Women experience impostor syndrome, which is a persistent fearing of impropriety, by tending to point out their own fears and express their flaws, underrating themselves. At the same time, women show more caution and more care for details than their male counterparts, emphasize teamwork and research, and show greater aptitude in surgical and medical practices. According to several authors, female neurosurgeons represent an important component for the future of the discipline and are essential to the field's growth. Nevertheless, young women feel a tension between the "women can have it all" movement and a realistic view of themselves as mothers, partners, employees, and leaders. As a young neurosurgeon, I think that our future is in our hands, it depends on our enthusiasm, on our energy but, above all, it will be bright, since we all are neurosurgeons.

ID INAPPROPRIATE SECRETION; INFANTS; HEMORRHAGE
AB BACKGROUND: Hyponatremia in the neonatal population is an uncommon occurrence and can be associated with significant increase in morbidity and mortality. In the neonatal population, it is typically associated with an excess of antidiuretic hormone and rarely has been found to be associated with hydrocephalus, short of being caused by the subsequent treatment of hydrocephalus.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a case report of a patient with neonatal hydrocephalus, secondary to intraventricular hemorrhage in the setting of prematurity, treated at our institution, in whom sodium levels reached a nadir as head circumference peaked and subsequent treatment of hydrocephalus resolved the associated hyponatremia.
   CONCLUSIONS: Hydrocephalus secondary to intraventricular hemorrhage is a notable complication in the premature neonatal population. Physicians should be aware of its potential association with hyponatremia and consider early neurosurgical intervention when other etiologies of the electrolyte disturbance cannot be identified.

AB In vestibular schwannoma surgery, the preservation of facial and cochlear nerves is of paramount concern regarding to their effect on patients' quality of life. The rate of nerve function preservation has increased with advancements in surgical technique and neuroimaging and the introduction of intraoperative neuromonitoring. The preoperative depiction of anatomical issues between the nerves and tumor could help in surgical planning. Many studies investigating advanced imaging for cranial nerves detection, in particular diffusion tensor imaging, have been reported in the past decade. A systematic review of the reported data evaluating preoperative facial nerve fiber tracking, followed by intraoperative verification, was conducted. Seventeen studies with 223 patients (mean age, 47.5 years; range 17-77; male/female ratio 1:1.4) met our inclusion criteria. Preoperative facial nerve fiber tracking was obtained for 214 patients (96%), and subsequent intraoperative verification revealed a correct prediction for 187 cases (85.5%). The results from the present review have confirmed that preoperative fiber tracking for facial nerve identification during large vestibular schwannoma surgery is valuable and reliable. However, the included studies were not comparable in terms of images, acquisitions, or postprocessing elaboration. Larger series and homogenous magnetic resonance imaging parameters are required to strengthen these findings.

AB BACKGROUND: Differential diagnosis of sellar masses includes adenoma, meningioma, craniopharyngioma, and metastasis. Primary paraganglioma is seldom considered. We present a case of this unique pathology, review the relevant literature, and compile a compendium of immunohistochemical characteristics for use as a resource.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 73-year-old woman presented to the hospital with visual changes in her left hemifield. Noncontrast head computed tomography demonstrated a large sellar mass with suprasellar extension and displacement of the optic chiasm (diameter of 3.1 cm). Magnetic resonance imaging was unobtainable owing to an incompatible pacemaker. Computed tomography characterization was most consistent with a macroadenoma. Given the acute visual decline, surgical decompression via an endonasal transsphenoidal route was performed without complication. A diagnosis of paraganglioma was made based on histopathology. Following resection, the patient's visual field deficit improved. Computed tomography body imaging was negative for a metastatic origin.
   CONCLUSIONS: Paraganglioma is a rare but potential differential diagnosis to consider when evaluating sellar masses.

TI Intrathecal Saline Infusion as an Effective Temporizing Measure in the
   Management of Spontaneous Intracranial Hypotension
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Intrathecal infusion; Spontaneous intracranial hypotension
AB BACKGROUND: Spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) is a rare condition for which no optimal treatment guidelines have been determined. The most common presentation is orthostatic headaches, but patients can present with a variety of symptoms.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a case of a 34-year-old man who developed progressive orthostatic headaches and bilateral subdural collections. His symptoms along with imaging of his brain and spine were consistent with SIH. Unfortunately, his symptoms continued to progress, and his level of consciousness became affected. The patient did not respond to either conservative management or epidural blood patching. As the result of his worsening condition, a lumbar drain was inserted for the intrathecal infusion of normal saline to prevent tonsillar herniation. Once the infusion was started, his level of consciousness improved. It was discovered that his cerebrospinal fluid leak was due to an osteophyte within his thoracic spine, which was eroding the dura. He underwent a costo-transversectomy with the removal of the osteophyte and repair of the dural defect. The patient had some improvement after this procedure, but he remained more somnolent than expected. On subsequent imaging, it was found that his subdural collections had increased slightly in size and it was decided to drain them. Both collections were released under high pressure, and he went on to make an excellent recovery.
   CONCLUSIONS: This case demonstrates that an intrathecal saline infusion can be used as an effective temporizing measure in patients with critical symptoms of SIH and it also alerts clinicians that low-pressure subdural collections can progress to subdural collections under high pressure.

ID ANEURYSM
AB BACKGROUND: Infectious pseudoaneurysm of the intracavernous carotid artery is rare, often caused by sphenoid sinusitis or transsphenoidal surgery. Management of intracranial infectious aneurysms (IIAs) remains a controversial topic lacking randomized controlled trials to guide clinical decision making.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: For this case, we used an antibiotic to treat the patient in the initial stage. Because IIAs enlarge rapidly, endovascular treatment was performed in the emergency department.
   CONCLUSIONS: Unfortunately, the patient died because the IIA recurred and ruptured. Therefore we speculated that stent-assisted coil placement for the treatment of ruptured infectious pseudoaneurysms of the internal carotid artery may not be safe.

ID ANEURYSMS
AB BACKGROUND: Cerebral arteriovenous malformations (CAVMs) are characterized by altered hemodynamics and associated with angioanatomic changes, such as aneurysms. We encountered a patient with a CAVM-associated dissection of the medial trunk of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) instead of an aneurysm.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report the case of a 56-year-old male patient with spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage within the cisterna magna and fourth ventricle. Digital subtraction angiography revealed a cerebellar arteriovenous malformation located within the inferior semilunar lobule that did not anatomically match the bleeding pattern. The left PICA, serving as a primary feeding artery, showed a dissection of the proximal portion of the medial trunk with a precise anatomic association with the blood in the telovelotonsillar space. CAVM-induced hyperdynamic flow through the feeding vessel is the most plausible pathophysiologic explanation for the dissection. Complete microsurgical resection of the CAVM was performed, and 3-month follow-up digital subtraction angiography showed complete regression of the dissection, disappearance of irregularities, and significant caliber reduction of the medial PICA trunk.
   CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of a hyperdynamic flow-related dissection of a CAVM-associated feeding vessel. Microsurgical resection of the CAVM allowed for spontaneous resolution of the dissected area by restoration of normal rheodynamics.

ID 6TH CRANIAL NERVES; CAVERNOUS SINUS; OCULOMOTOR NERVES; NEURINOMA;
   NEUROMA; 3RD
AB BACKGROUND: Abducens nerve function seldom shows complete recovery after removal of abducens nerve schwannoma. No cases with unclear course of the abducens nerve during surgery have been reported to achieve complete recovery of nerve function.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report the case of a 44-year-old woman who presented with occasional dysgeusia without abducens nerve paresis. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a solid tumor about 2 cm in diameter at the left cerebellopontine cistern. Cranial nerves except the abducens nerve appeared intact. The tumor was removed via suboccipital craniotomy. The abducens nerve was totally invisible on the surface of the tumor throughout the procedure. Only short segments of abducens nerve were identifiable at around Dorello's canal and the root exit zone. The tumor was resected by subcapsular dissection, and part of the tumor capsule was preserved as a scaffold for nerve generation, although whether any abducens nerve was included remained uncertain. Histopathologic examination confirmed World Health Organization grade I schwannoma. Postoperatively, the patient presented with complete left abducens nerve paresis and diplopia, but abducens nerve function began to improve 3 months later and had completely recovered within 16 months after surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: This represents the first description of abducens nerve schwannoma in which the course of the abducens nerve was intraoperatively unclear but complete recovery was achieved. In such cases, intentional subcapsular dissection may potentiate functional recovery.

TI Tracheomalacia as Complication of Stenting for Esophageal Injury After
   Transsternal Approach to High Thoracic Vertebral Metastasis
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Esophageal injury; Esophageal stenting; Tracheomalacia; Transsternal
   approach; Vertebral metastasis
AB BACKGROUND: Esophageal injury is a severe surgical complication of a transsternal approach to high thoracic vertebral metastasis, which can result in mediastinitis and life-threatening consequences. A covered stent can be placed in the esophagus to prevent mediastinal leakage. However, tracheomalacia is a rare complication following esophageal stenting.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 56-year-old man had a pathologic fracture of the T3 vertebral body with spinal cord compression, myelopathy, and neurogenic bladder. An esophageal injury was noticed during the transsternal approach. Immediate suture repair, drainage tube placement, and subsequent esophageal stenting were carried out. One month after discharge, the endoscopic examination revealed nonhealing of the esophagus, and a new covered stent was replaced. Episodes of severe stridor and dyspnea led to the patient being sent to the emergency department. Computed tomography scan of the chest revealed a focal collapse of the trachea at the thoracic inlet, and tracheomalacia was suspected. The covered stent was removed, despite nonhealing of the esophagus. His stridor, dyspnea, and constant coughing subsided afterwards. The endoscopic examination at 3 months after stent removal showed complete healing of the esophagus.
   CONCLUSIONS: Esophageal stenting can be used to prevent mediastinal leakage due to esophageal injury in the transsternal approach for high thoracic vertebral metastasis, but the stent might be a cause of tracheomalacia. Stent removal should be considered if upper airway obstruction occurs. Awareness of the radial force of the stent, esophageal composition (e.g., status post suture repair), and esophageal diameter must be considered for optimal stent tolerance to avoid complications.

AB OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present study was to conduct a meta-analysis to systematically compare the incidence rates of in-stent restenosis after carotid artery stenting (CAS) and restenosis after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for patients with atherosclerotic carotid stenosis.
   METHODS: We retrieved potential academic reports comparing restenosis between CEA and CAS from the MEDLINE, PubMed, and EMBASE databases and the Cochrane Library from the date of the first CEA (January 1951) to July 20, 2018. The references of the identified studies were carefully reviewed to ensure that all available reports were included in the present study.
   RESULTS: Our meta-analysis included 27 studies (15 randomized controlled trials, 12 nonrandomized controlled trials) and 20,479 participants with atherosclerotic carotid stenosis. A statistically significant difference was found in the cumulative incidence of restenosis >70% between CEA and CAS (risk difference, -0.033, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.054 to -0.013; P = 0.002). For the restenosis >70% outcomes, although CEA was relevant with a lower rate of restenosis than CAS within 6 months (odds ratio [OR], 0.495; 95% CI, 0.285-0.861; P = 0.013) and 1 year (OR, 0.626; 95% CI, 0.483-0.811; P < 0.001), no statistically significant differences were found at 1.5 years (P = 0.210), 2 years (P = 0.123), 4 years (P = 0.124), 5 years (P = 0.327), or 10 years (P = 0.839). For the restenosis >50% outcomes, a significant difference was found in the rate of restenosis between the CEA and CAS groups within 1 year (OR, 0.317; 95% CI, 0.228-0.441; P < 0.001) but not at 1.5 years (P = 0.301), 2 years (P = 0.686), or 5 years (P = 0.920). No nominally significant effects were demonstrated with respect to the cumulative incidence of occlusion (P = 0.195) or the cumulative incidence of restenosis for symptomatic patients (P = 0.170) between CEA and CAS.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although CAS was preferred over CEA, regardless of restenosis >50% or >70% after revascularization within 1 year, no significant difference was observed with extension of the follow-up period to >1 year. CAS was not associated with a greater cumulative incidence of occlusion or the cumulative incidence of restenosis for symptomatic patients.

AB BACKGROUND: A 26-year-old man presented with acute quadriparesis owing to a traffic accident. A computed tomography scan revealed a hangman fracture and locking of the left facet joint at C2-3. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a high signal change of the spinal cord on T2-weighted image and hemorrhage in the C2-3 level.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: An emergency closed reduction after anterior cervical diskectomy and fusion were performed for spinal stability and decompression of the dural sac. Five months postoperatively, C1-2-3 posterior wiring using an iliac bone graft with the Brook method was performed due to nonunion of C2-3. After using the posterior cervical approach, the patient began complaining about the difficulty in swallowing. A 5 x 2 x 1-cm-sized posterior pharyngeal wall mass was detected on an endoscopic examination. Despite conservative management, the retropharyngeal mass progressed and dysphagia worsened, so the retropharyngeal wall granulation mass was resected by a laryngologist. Despite removal of the granulation mass, dysphagia and throat discomfort persisted for about 2 years. The plate and screws were removed considering their possible correlation with the granulation tissue. One month after plate removal, the retropharyngeal granulation tissue resolved almost spontaneously. At the last follow-up, the radiologic examination showed well-fused C1-2-3 with good alignment. The patient had no residual neurologic deficits or dysphagia.
   CONCLUSIONS: Retropharyngeal granulation can occur as a late complication associated with plate fixation after anterior cervical diskectomy and fusion. Recurrent retropharyngeal wall granulation caused by plate irritation might only be resolved after plate and screw removal.

AB The aims of the present study were to compare the longitudinal changes of glioblastoma multiforme after radiotherapy (RT) between 11C-methionine positron emission tomography (MET-PET) and gadolinium (Gd)-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and to clarify whether these changes were predictive of survival. We included 30 patients, who had undergone MET-PET and Gd-MRI before and every 3 months after RT. The lesion/normal brain uptake (L/N) ratio and contrast-enhancing lesion volume were examined. The L/N ratio was decreased until 9 months after RT with significance until 3 months. The contrast-enhancing lesion volume was decreased until 3 months and thereafter increased until 9 months with significance. The variation rates of the L/N ratio between pre-RT and 3 months differentiated survival of >23 months from <= 23 months. A dissociation could exist in the longitudinal changes of GBM after RT between MET-PET and Gd-MRI. The variation rate of the L/N ratio could be related to survival.

AB Subclavian steal phenomenon can cause retrograde flow through the ipsilateral vertebral artery as a result of atherosclerosis of the subclavian artery. Clinically this can present as intermittent vertebrobasilar ischemia or claudication of the affected extremity, but rarely it poses a serious risk of neurologic morbidity or mortality. Aneurysm formation at the vertebrobasilar junction is rare but may occur as a sequela of increased flow through 1 vertebral artery, as occurs in subclavian steal syndrome.

AB Meningiomas extended to the scalp without any bony changes are rare. A 79-year-old man presented with a large subcutaneous mass in the midline parieto-occipital region and progressive right hemiparesis. The contrast-enhanced millimetric computed tomography scans of the head showed the intracranial parasagittal enhanced mass invading the superior sagittal sinus and the subcutaneous mass without any bony destructive, osteoblastic, or osteolytic changes. Under the operative microscope, no visible communication was found between the intracranial and extracranial mass lesions. Histopathologic examination of both intracranial and extracranial tumors demonstrated the same atypical meningioma (World Health Organization grade II). The possible route of extracranial extension of the tumor may be the sizable parietal foramen.

TI Language Mapping of Hindi and English in a Bilingual Patient During
   Resection of a Right Frontal Glioma
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Awake surgeries; Gliomas; Language mapping; Neuronal plasticity
ID SURGERY; MIND
AB BACKGROUND: Recent advancements in understanding the molecular basis of gliomas and new concepts of neuronal plasticity have shown the importance of maximal resection in gliomas to improve progression-free overall survival. Awake craniotomies with intraoperative cortical and subcortical mapping have helped to achieve this aim while allowing us to preserve executive function including language. Language mapping becomes a daunting task in individuals who are bilingual because of the complexity of varied cortical representation of different languages.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a case of a bilingual patient who underwent re-resection of right frontal astrocytoma using principles of awake surgery and language mapping. Our patient was fluent in English and Hindi. She underwent a complete neurophysiologic cognitive assessment in both languages preoperatively. She was tested for speech arrest, nominal aphasia, and semantic paraphasia intraoperatively for both English and Hindi. She underwent a gross total resection with postoperative preservation of both English and Hindi. Intraoperative language mapping revealed that while certain cortical areas overlapped between 2 languages, other aspects were represented by distinct areas. Postoperative assessment at 2 months revealed most major aspects of language remained preserved or had improved relative to the preoperative baseline.
   CONCLUSIONS: Advancements in anesthesia and neuromonitoring have further allowed for long awake periods, permitting complex language tasks to be tested intraoperatively. The results obtained from this case study have allowed us to further plan for awake surgeries for patients with bilingualism. With understanding bilingual representation of languages, we hope to achieve maximal resection with minimal postoperative deficits.

AB BACKGROUND: Perforation of a solid visceral organ and subsequent development of a cerebrospinal fluid pseudocyst is a rare complication of ventriculoperitoneal shunts.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A patient with a history of global developmental delay presented with shunt failure secondary to an intrahepatic cerebrospinal fluid pseudocyst. The diagnosis had not been initially apparent owing to the absence of ventriculomegaly or a palpable abdominal mass and/or tenderness. Following diagnosis on abdominal imaging, the pseudocyst was aspirated, and the ventriculoperitoneal shunt was successfully revised.
   CONCLUSIONS: A series of 22 cases of previously reported intrahepatic pseudocysts and abscesses is presented, and the putative mechanisms that have been put forward to explain the development of these collections are discussed. Review of the literature demonstrates that several techniques have been successfully employed in the management of this complication.

DT Review
DE Anaplastic lymphoma kinase; Central nervous system; Inflammatory
   myofibroblastic tumor
ID CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM
AB BACKGROUND: Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) is an indolent tumor mainly affecting children and young adults. As a rare mesenchymal tumor with unknown etiology and pathogenesis, IMT has a predilection for the lung and abdominopelvic region. Previous literature featuring IMT in the central nervous system (IMT-CNS) is rare. The clinical symptoms and radiologic features of IMT-CNS are not specific; therefore, the diagnosis is predominately based on the histopathologic and immunohistochemical analysis of the specimen.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We herein present a case of a 21-year-old woman who complained of bilateral blurred vision for 15 days. Head magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a round-shaped and irregular lesion located in the right frontal lobe. The boundary of the lesion was clear, and the lesion was homogeneously enhanced. Peripheral edema of the lesion was observed, and the mass effect was obvious. Supratentorial craniotomy tumor resection was performed. Histopathologic and immunohistochemical analysis revealed IMT, which had negative expression of anaplastic lymphoma kinase.
   CONCLUSIONS: Remission of her symptoms was observed, and no recurrence was recorded during a 6-month follow-up.

ID MR
AB BACKGROUND: Intracranial lipomas are extremely rare fat-containing lesions, comprising 0.1-0.5% of all primary brain tumors. Lipoma of corpus callosum, the commonest variety of all intracranial lipomas (40%-50%), is associated with varying degrees of dysgenesis of corpus callosum and generally remains asymptomatic.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: In this study, we report 2 cases of pericallosal lipomas admitted with seizures and discuss the clinical and radiologic findings in light of the literature.
   CONCLUSIONS: Lipomas of the corpus callosum are rare, fat-containing asymptomatic lesions, mostly associated with dysgenesis of the corpus callosum. Diagnosis accidentally occurs during diagnostic procedures in case of an encephalic disorder. Magnetic resonance imaging is the most useful modality for a differential diagnosis. Prognosis and symptoms depend on associated malformations. Surgical treatment is mostly not indicated and should be avoided.

AB BACKGROUND: Severe kyphoscoliosis associated with multiple giant spinal epidural arachnoid cysts (SEACs) is an extremely rare condition and remains a challenge in clinical practice. This study aimed to present a case of severe spinal deformity associated with multiple giant SEACs and to discuss strategies for the preoperative diagnosis and treatment.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 22-year-old man with severe thoracolumbar kyphoscoliosis associated with multiple giant SEACs presented with progressive scoliosis, spastic paralysis, numbness, and abnormal gait. X-ray and magnetic resonance imaging revealed severe rigid kyphoscoliosis, extensive diffuse cystic space-occupying lesions, and diffuse spinal cord compression. After multidisciplinary consultation and discussion, the patient underwent a cystperitoneal shunting surgery followed by posterior vertebral column resection (PVCR) correction. The postoperative course was uneventful. Both kyphosis and scoliosis were significantly corrected, and muscle weakness of the lower extremities and sensory disturbance partially improved. At the 2-year follow-up visit, the patient could freely walk without the aid of crutches, but there were some residual neurologic deficits in both legs. A plain radiograph showed that bony fusion was achieved, and the correction was well maintained.
   CONCLUSIONS: Cyst-peritoneal shunting surgery followed by PVCR, as in our case, could be an alternative surgical strategy for multiple giant SEACs associated with severe rigid kyphoscoliosis.

ID DEFORMITY; CHILDREN; RESECTION; FUSION; INSTABILITY; SURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: Laminectomy (LAMT) and laminoplasty (LAMP) have been widely applied on patients with spinal cord tumors (SCTs). However, the clinical efficacy of LAMP versus LAMT remains controversial. The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of LAMP compared to LAMT in the treatment of SCTs.
   METHODS: We searched several English and Chinese databases (PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, CBM, CNKI and Wan Fang) to identify relevant randomized controlled trials or observational studies. The quality of included studies was assessed by the Cochrane Collaboration's tool and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The outcome measures included the primary and secondary outcomes. Subgroups analysis was performed to explore the impact of study type, age, type of tumor, tumor size, surgical levels, follow-up time, surgical methods (whether with fusion) on the outcome measures.
   RESULTS: Sixteen studies of 1096 patients with SCTs were included in this meta-analysis. The results showed statistically significant differences between the LAMP and LAMT groups in terms of effective recovery rate (P = 0.003), blood loss (P < 0.00001), hospital stays (P = 0.006), spinal deformity (P = 0.01), and cerebrospinal fluid leak (P < 0.00001). However, there was no significant differences in total resection rate of tumor (P = 0.21) and operation time (P = 0.14). In the subgroup analysis, the results indicated that age, type of tumor, follow-up time, surgical levels, and methods were the influence factors for the incidence of spinal deformity.
   CONCLUSIONS: LAMP might be a safer and more effective surgical method in the treatment of SCTs. In addition, the advantage of fusion in preventing the occurrence of spinal deformity should not to be ignored. However, because of the lack of high quality randomized controlled trials and adequate data, the safety and validity of LAMP was undermined.

ID DECOMPRESSION; SURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: Despite the fact that technologic advances and surgical experience expand the use of endoscope in spinal surgery, there are few reports on its application in the management of spinal tumors. We present a case report of intradural extramedullary tumor excision with the percutaneous full endoscopic translaminar approach.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 67-year-old male presented to our clinic with lumbar, left thigh pain and paresthesia in both thighs. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging revealed a contrast-enhanced intradural extramedullary mass with benign characteristics on L1 with the preliminary diagnosis of meningioma. The percutaneous translaminar endoscopic approach was planned to remove the intradural extramedullary tumor from a 7-mm skin incision. Surgery was planned in 4 stages: 1) exposure of the dura by opening a window on the lamina, 2) opening and expanding of the dura, 3) exposure of all sides of the tumor, and 4) excision of the tumor and hemostasis. Closing the dura and ending the surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: This report supports that full endoscopic spinal intradural extramedullary mass excision may give good results in selected cases and in experienced hands.

SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY

DT Article
DE Cerebral aneurysm; Clipping; Middle cerebral artery; Multiple clipping;
   Surgical technique; Tandem clipping
ID BYPASS-SURGERY; GIANT
AB BACKGROUND: Treatment of complex unruptured middle cerebral artery (MCA) aneurysms that are untreatable with conventional surgical techniques are rare, and direct aneurysmal clipping usually remains the first-line treatment for large and giant saccular MCA aneurysms. Tandem clipping and multiple clipping techniques represent neck reconstruction in direct clipping surgeries that address these aneurysms.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: The authors describe a simple variation of neck reconstructive clipping techniques for the large MCA unruptured aneurysm in a patient with an unruptured 20-mm MCA bifurcation aneurysm. The key of this technique is the application of an appropriate initial clip, the "mass reduction clip"; this clip is inserted not into the aneurysmal neck but on the center of the aneurysmal dome so as to compress the dome at first, which yields a change in the aneurysm's shape and reduces the size of the whole aneurysmal mass. This technique facilitates the ensuing neck reconstruction according to the concept of the ideal closure line using few clips.
   CONCLUSIONS: "Mass reduction" clipping, which changes the shape of the aneurysm and reduces the size of the whole aneurysmal mass, is a useful variation for the treatment of large aneurysms when conventional clipping across the neck is feasible.

AB Brain metastases occur in a large portion of patients with cancer. Although advances in radiotherapy have helped to improve survival, they have also raised questions regarding the best modality for retreatment in the context of recurrent disease. The spectrum of treatment options for recurrent intracranial metastatic disease after previous radiotherapy includes salvage stereotactic radiosurgery, whole brain radiotherapy, and brachytherapy. We have comprehensively reviewed the existing data on the efficacy and toxicity of the various reirradiation treatment modalities. We examined the key clinical considerations that guide patient selection, such as dose, tumor size, interval to retreatment, and local control and survival rates.

DE Anomaly; Middle cerebral artery stenosis; Nonbifurcating cervical

ID ANASTOMOSIS
AB BACKGROUND: A nonbifurcating cervical carotid artery (NBCCA) is a rare anatomic variation of the carotid artery which directly arises from the common carotid artery without forming a bifurcation. A rare case of an NBCCA associated with middle cerebral artery (MCA) stenosis is reported herein.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 70-year-old man was admitted to the hospital for fresh infarctions in the left frontoparietal lobe. The angiographic imaging showed severe atherosclerotic stenosis in the left MCA associated with an ipsilateral NBCCA. The origin of the left internal carotid artery (ICA) was occluded leaving a stump. A tortuous anastomotic vessel arose from the external carotid artery and continued as the cervical ICA. A stent was placed in the left MCA, and the patient recovered uneventfully and without further ischemia during follow-up. Embryogenesis and naming considerations are briefly discussed.
   CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of an NBCCA accompanied by ipsilateral MCA stenosis. The name hypogenesis/agenesis of the proximal ICA might describe the congenital anatomic variation of an NBCCA more accurately than NBCCA.

DT Article

   Intraoperative fluorescence; PCR; Protoporphyrin IX
ID 5-AMINOLEVULINIC ACID
AB BACKGROUND: At present, the differential diagnosis of magnetic resonance imaging enhancing lesions can still be challenging. Preoperative imaging is a valuable tool characterized by high informative value, even if false-positive and false-negative results are possible. In this context, 5-aminolevulenic acid (5-ALA) represents a significant adjunct in glioblastoma (GBM) surgery displaying an assumed specific accumulation only in tumor cells. However, it was anecdotally reported that in some cases it can also be detected in nonneoplastic lesions mimicking GBM, thus potentially leading to misdiagnosis. Moreover, precise identification of involved pathogens from intraoperative brain samples may remain difficult. We report the case of an abscess from Aggregatibacter mimicking a GBM both during preoperative imaging and intraoperatively, since showing 5-ALA fluorescence.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 54-year-old man presented with intense cephalalgia, vomiting, and scotomas in his left eye. Brain magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a right temporo-occipital rim-enhancing mass, highly suggestive of a GBM, and for this reason the patient underwent 5-ALALguided complete removal. Histopathologic analysis proved the lesion to be a bacterial abscess from Aggregatibacter as confirmed by polymerase chain reaction on bacterial deoxyribonucleic acid.
   CONCLUSIONS: 5-ALA fluorescence may not be specifically involved only in malignant tumor cells, thus raising the suspect for alternative diagnoses to GBM and inviting caution into fluorescence-guided surgery.

   semicircular canal dehiscence; Tegmen defects; Temporal encephalocele
ID TENSION PNEUMOCEPHALUS; CANAL DEHISCENCE; PNEUMATIZATION
AB BACKGROUND: Pneumocephalus is commonly associated with cranial trauma including surgical interventions. Spontaneous pneumocephalus on the other hand is a rare diagnosis. Reported cases were predominantly unilateral. We report a unique case of a bilateral spontaneous pneumocephalus probably related to a bilateral tegmen defect related to repeated Politzer maneuvers.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 78-year-old man suffered from vertigo, tinnitus, instability, and mild expressive aphasia. In the past 12 weeks before clinical deterioration he underwent series of Politzer maneuvers performed for repetitive inflammation of upper respiratory tract with otitis media. Brain computed tomography revealed a large bilateral collection of intracranial air with associated tegmen defects. Primarily, surgical revision of the middle fossa and multilayer reconstruction of the dura and skull base defect on the left side was performed. After 5 days, the other side was reconstructed in a similar way. Postoperative course was uneventful with brisk improvement of symptomatology. Both computed tomography scans undertaken after the first and second surgery showed satisfying regression of intracranial air.
   CONCLUSIONS: Spontaneous pneumocephalus represents a rare condition often associated with increased middle ear pressure, which can be caused by autoinflation (e.g., Valsalva or Politzer maneuver), sneezing, or coughing. The described case represents a unique presentation of the bilateral spontaneous pneumocephalus associated with bilateral tegmen and dura mater defects managed surgically. Despite its rarity, spontaneous pneumocephalus originating from the temporal bone should be considered as a possible diagnosis in patients with suggestive otologic presentation (e.g., tinnitus, instability, hearing loss) and associated nonspecific neurologic symptomatology.

AB BACKGROUND: Formal studies that validated functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) against direct cortical stimulation (DCS) have shown inconsistencies.
   METHODS: We reviewed the reported data and performed a meta-analysis of studies that had validated fMRI using DCS and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. We performed the meta-analysis of the studies that had met our inclusion criteria. The positive predictive values (PPVs), negative predictive values (NPVs), false omission rates (FORs), false discovery rates (FDRs), sensitivity, and specificity were calculated. We also identified the factors that could influence the fMRI findings.
   RESULTS: Six studies of language activation and two of motor activation were eligible for the present meta-analysis. The PPV of fMRI for the detection of eloquent motor cortex was 59.5%, and the FDR was 40.5%. The NPV was 96% and the FOR was 3.9%. The sensitivity and specificity of fMRI for the detection of the eloquent motor cortex was 91% and 76%, respectively. For language activation, the PPV was 71.7%, the NPV was 80%, the FDR was 28.2%, and the FOR was 19.5%. The sensitivity and specificity was 80% and 71.5%, respectively. The factors that could have caused a mismatch or affected the reliability were analyzed.
   CONCLUSION: The results from the present analysis of the available reported evidence suggest that fMRI itself (due to neurovascular uncoupling) or analysis of the findings have limitations regarding reliability when validated against DCS. From the existing studies, our results indicate that using fMRI alone for surgical planning could lead to undesirable outcomes.

Interest in posterior subthalamic area stimulation for various types of involuntary abnormal movements has arisen owing to positive results in patients affected by tremor refractory to ventralis intermedius deep brain stimulation.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 23-year-old man, with a 15-year history of left upper limb dystonic tremor due to a stroke in the right thalamus, underwent deep brain stimulation with a single electrode passing through the right ventralis oralis anterior/ventralis oralis posterior nuclei and caudal zona incerta. Objective movement outcomes were assessed through the Unified Dystonia Rating Scale and Fahn-Tolosa-Marin Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor. The impact of tremor on activities of daily living was assessed with the ADL-T24 questionnaire, and quality of life was assessed with the Quality of Life Scale. All questionnaires were administered before deep brain stimulation and at 5-year follow-up. Unified Dystonia Rating Scale and Fahn-Tolosa-Marin Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor scores decreased from 14.5 to 4.5 and from 46 to 7, respectively. ADL-T24 score decreased from 19 to 3, whereas Quality of Life Scale score increased from 49 to 82.
   CONCLUSIONS: Stimulation of motor thalamus and caudal zona incerta could be a viable treatment for patients affected by tremor of various origins, including dystonic tremor, refractory to medical therapy.

AB OBJECTIVE: Modern neuroanatomic education should be based on interdisciplinary methods that allow an understanding of the cerebral circuitry, which is at the base of the structural connectivity. Ex-vivo MRI-guided dissection is an essential method for developing and refining the knowledge of complex 3-dimensional brain anatomy and the mutual relationships between structures and architecture of the white matter bundles. The aim of this technical note is to present a new and innovative method of studying human brain white matter.
   METHODS: Four adult human cerebral hemispheres were prepared according to the Klinger's method. T1-weighted and T2-weighted and fluid attenuated inversion recovery images were obtained with a 3T magnetic resonance machine. The dissection was performed in a dedicated neurosurgical laboratory equipped with a microscope and an electromagnetic neuronavigation system that guided the whole white matter dissection.
   RESULTS: Gyri and sulci morphology were studied in detail. The relations between superficial and inner structures were observed before and after the dissection. Gray matter was carefully removed with blunt dissectors, and the U-fibers were exposed. Afterwards, deeper association and projection fibers, such as the arcuate fasciculus, superior and inferior longitudinal fasciculus, corona radiata, extreme and external capsule, claustrum, anterior commissure, and internal capsule were visualized under high magnification. The neuronavigation system was crucial for continuously checking the whole dissection procedure to avoid any accidental excision of fibers.
   CONCLUSION: Image-guided neuronavigated dissection can significantly improve the quality of white matter dissection and represents a valid tool for learning the 3-dimensional anatomy of the human brain tracts.

AB BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Both microvascular decompression (MVD) and Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) are time-tested treatment modalities for trigeminal neuralgia (TN). There is little evidence in the literature studying these modalities head to head in a cost-effectiveness comparison.
   OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of MVD compared with GKRS for treating patients with TN.
   METHODS: We developed a Markov cost-effectiveness model for the U.S. health care system to account for all costs related to MVD and GKRS as treatment modalities for TN, from the health care system perspective, over a patient lifetime horizon. A base case was estimated using data from previous studies, from our own GKRS experience, and from a current data analysis of patients undergoing MVD. We derived model inputs, including health care costs, survival, and utility estimates, from the literature. We used age-specific, sex-specific, and race-specific mortality from national registries. Costs studied included those for MVD, for GKRS, for treating complications from either procedure, and for medications throughout patient lifetimes. We performed multiple 1-way, 2-way, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses to confirm the robustness of model assumptions and results. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), with a threshold of $50,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, defined cost-effectiveness.
   RESULTS: The base case had an ICER of $12,154 per QALY for MVD compared with GKRS. Probabilistic sensitivity (Monte Carlo) analysis showed that MVD was cost-effective in 70% of model iterations. GKRS was favored when the willingness to pay threshold was <$12,000 per QALY gained.
   CONCLUSIONS: In patients medically eligible for either procedure, we found MVD to be the most cost-effective modality to treat TN, primarily because of its reported greater durability. MVD remained the most cost-effective strategy across a broad range of model input values in sensitivity analyses.

   sinusitis; Invasive sinusitis; Stroke; Thrombectomy
ID CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; MYCOTIC-ANEURYSM; RHINOSINUSITIS; ASPERGILLOSIS
AB BACKGROUND: Intracranial vascular infections of fungal etiology are extremely rare. Most cases occur in immunocompromised patients with invasive fungal disease, most commonly originating in the paranasal sinuses or the lungs. Granulomatous invasive rhinosinusitis, which is extremely rare in North America, has been reported to affect immunocompetent patients in most cases, and its causative strain has potential to invade the intracranial arteries. We present a rare case of basilar artery rupture and infarction secondary to granulomatous invasive rhinosinusitis.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 50-year-old man in Florida presented with ischemic symptoms and a 6-month history of headache, dizziness, and falls. After biopsy, the patient developed subarachnoid hemorrhage and thrombosis. Several thrombectomy attempts were performed, resulting in persistent occlusion of the basilar artery and subsequent comatous state. After discussion with the patient's family, compassionate weaning and autopsy were authorized.
   CONCLUSIONS: Invasive fungal rhinosinusitis is more frequent nowadays owing to increased use of immunosuppressive therapies. However, it is still a disease that mostly affects immunocompromised patients. The development of new microbiologic investigation techniques has enabled the discovery of fungal diseases that can also affect immunocompetent hosts, such as granulomatous invasive rhinosinusitis. This is an extremely rare condition in North America, with very few cases documented in the last few decades.

ID THERAPIES; SECONDARY; MECHANISMS; PATIENT
AB BACKGROUND: Previous studies have described the association of spinal epidural lipomatosis with several conditions including chronic steroid therapy, Cushing's syndrome, obesity, Paget disease, and hypothyroidism. We present a report of rapid development of spinal epidural lipomatosis after treatment with second-generation anti-androgen therapy, a new strategy for treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer that has been increasingly employed in the past few years. A comprehensive discussion of the underlying molecular networks involving androgen receptor blockage and adipocyte differentiation, as well as the clinical implications of such a phenomenon, are provided.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We describe the clinical and radiological evolution of a 58-year-old male patient with metastatic prostate cancer, who developed new onset of rapidly progressing lumbosacral epidural lipomatosis with significant compression of the nerve roots of the cauda equina a few months after initiation of treatment with second-generation androgen receptor antagonists.
   CONCLUSIONS: The underlying pathophysiology of adipose tissue growth following the administration of anti-androgen therapy is discussed, with emphasis on both the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin pathway as well as in the Wnt-independent pathway involving direct activation of downstream transcription factors from the T-cell factor family by the androgen receptor. As second-generation androgen receptor antagonists have been increasingly used for treatment of castration-resistant stage metastatic prostate cancer, new onset of symptomatic epidural lipomatosis should be considered as a possible differential diagnosis, especially because the urinary symptoms of cauda equina compression may be improperly attributed to the primary prostate neoplasm.

ID PLEXUS AVULSION INJURY; ROOT TRANSFER; PRESPINAL ROUTE; REPAIR; TRUNK
AB BACKGROUND: Contralateral C7 nerve transfer is widely applied for the treatment of brachial plexus injuries or central paralysis of the upper extremities. The surgical approach has evolved from the precervical subcutaneous route to the prespinal route, which is currently the most commonly used one. We report a patient with central paralysis of the right upper extremity treated with contralateral C7 nerve transfer via the posterior spinal route.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 59-year-old female patient was admitted on 3 July, 2018 with right hemiplegia. The muscle strength of the right lower and upper extremities was grade 4 and 0, respectively. On the basis of magnetic resonance imaging, she was diagnosed with central paralysis of the right upper extremity. Considering the short length of the patient's healthy C7 nerve, contralateral C7 nerve transfer via the posterior spinal route was performed. No intraoperative complication was encountered. The patient reported slight numbness of the volar side of the left thumb, middle finger, and index finger after surgery. The patient showed a right shrug movement 1.5 months after surgery.
   CONCLUSION: We propose carrying out contralateral C7 nerve transfer via the posterior spinal route because of the shorter distance, no need for nerve transplantation, and low occurrence of the complications encountered with the prespinal route (such as vertebral artery injuries, esophageal fistula, and upper extremity pain when swallowing).

AB BACKGROUND: The location of the origin of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) is highly variable. An extracranial origin PICA from the vertebral artery (VA) is not rare. But the PICA originated extradurally where the VA ascends between the transverse foramina of C-2 and C-1, a rare anatomic variant. Double-origin PICA is another rare anatomic variant observed in 1%-4% of patients in whom 2 PICA branches converge distally.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a rare cadaveric anatomy case in which both PICAs originated extradurally between the vertebrae C1 and C2, a simultaneously existing right double-origin PICA. For this case, the right PICA was a double-origin PICA, including 1 extradural origin in which the VA ascends between the transverse foramina of C-2 and C-1 and another being intradural and intracranial.
   CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first report of a cadaveric anatomy case of bilateral PICA that originated extradurally between the vertebrae C-1 and C-2, and simultaneously there existed a right double-origin PICA. Such a case is rare, but understanding of the anatomic variation is important. To avoid complications during surgery at the craniovertebral junction, these potential variations should be correctly identified preoperatively.

AB OBJECTIVE: Stereoscopic video recordings of operative microscopy during neuroanatomic dissections are an important component of surgical training and research in well-financed medical schools and teaching hospitals. However, the high cost of the latest operative microscopes with integrated video recording equipment can be a limiting factor in their worldwide use. The aim of the present work is to provide a simple low-cost 3-dimensional (3D) stereoscopic operative microscope recording system that can be used even in economically and resource-limited locations. This is achieved by using readily available smartphones, smartphone accessories, and computer software.
   METHODS: Stereoscopic recording is accomplished by attaching and aligning matched or similar smartphones to the eyepieces of an operative microscope using readily available smartphone mounting connectors. Video recordings from the smartphones are then transferred to a personal computer and processed with a video-editing software to generate stereoscopic movies that are viewed on a smartphone using virtual-reality glasses.
   RESULTS: The setup time to mount and align the smartphone cameras typically requires 15-30 minutes. Video image quality and 3D depth presentation is more than sufficient for surgical training and research purposes. The implementation cost ranges from $1,315-$7,066, or much less if smartphones and a computer are already available.
   CONCLUSIONS: The 3D video system demonstrated herein can be implemented on any type of operative microscope, including older units for which commercial stereo recording systems are not available. The system and method presented herein can be readily and affordably implemented in low-budget environments for clinical training and research.

ID CA2+ RELEASE; INHIBITION; VASOCONSTRICTION; DEATH
AB BACKGROUND: Dantrolene has a safe side-effect profile and a mechanism of action that makes it attractive as an option for treatment of cerebral vasospasm. The authors report 2 cases of refractory cerebral vasospasm secondary to aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage that were successfully treated with intra-arterial (IA) dantrolene.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Two patients, a 63-year-old woman and 36-year-old woman, developed severe vasospasm refractory to IA vasodilators after rupture of anterior communicating artery aneurysms. IA dantrolene was injected in doses of 15-30 mg in the affected distributions and mean arterial pressure, intracranial pressure, and heart rate were monitored. There was immediate improvement in lumen diameter of the affected vessels following dantrolene injection. No significant differences in mean arterial pressure or intracranial pressure before and after IA dantrolene were observed. Both patients demonstrated clinical improvement within 24 hours without any further deterioration during the rest of their admission. Follow-up angiography 48 hours after IA dantrolene treatment demonstrated continued resolution of cerebral vasospasm.
   CONCLUSIONS: This evidence suggests IA dantrolene as a safe and effective novel alternative for the treatment of cerebral vasospasm.

ID NOONAN SYNDROME; 4TH-VENTRICLE; PATIENT
AB BACKGROUND: Rosette-forming glioneuronal tumour [RGNT] is a relatively rare entity first identified as a separate entity in 2002. We are reporting the second case of RGNT in the opticochiasmatic region.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a case report and literature review of RGNT with syndromic association.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although initial reports were predominantly in the fourth ventricle, many recent reports have identified the possibility of its occurrence outside fourth ventricle in pineal gland, spinal cord, septum pellucidum, lateral ventricle, and suprasellar region. To date, only 1 case of RGNT involving the opticochiasmatic region has been reported in a patient with neurofibromatosis type 1. Genetic analysis of this rare tumor identified 3 hotspots involving somatic mutations of FGFR-1 and PIK3CA and a germline mutation involving PTPN11, which can be targets for therapeutic intervention in cases where complete resection is not possible. To the best of our knowledge, we report the first case of RGNT involving the opticochiasmatic region without any syndromic association. Other cases of RGNT with syndromic associations provide us with insight into possible therapeutic interventions.

TI Neurenteric Cyst of the Ventral Craniocervical Junction: Case Report and
   Review of the Literature
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Review
DE Neurenteric cyst; Posterior approach; Ventral cervicomedullary junction
ID CRANIOVERTEBRAL JUNCTION
AB BACKGROUND: Neurenteric cysts (NCs) are rare, non-neoplastic lesions arising from a failure of dissolution of the transient neurenteric canal between the foregut and the notochord. They are most frequently seen in the intradural extramedullary space in the lower cervical and upper thoracic spine. The authors describe a rare case of NC arising from the ventral cervicomedullary junction that was totally resected via a posterior approach.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 24-year-old woman presented with a 4-week history of neck pain and progressive left hemiparesis. Admission magnetic resonance imaging scans demonstrated an intradural extramedullary cystic mass lesion ventral to the upper spinal cord from medulla to C2. We performed a posterior approach and the lesion was totally removed. Surgical treatment resulted in resolution of the neurologic impairments. The histological results were consistent with NC. Postoperative course was uneventful. At the 6-month follow-up, the patient is asymptomatic and magnetic resonance imaging scan shows no residual lesion.
   CONCLUSIONS: NC is a rare lesion of the craniospinal junction and should be considered among differential diagnoses. Complete excision is the treatment of choice. In most instances a dorsal surgical approach will be satisfactory.

AB BACKGROUND: Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) is a novel radiation-free tomographic imaging method that provides a background-free, signal attenuation-free, direct quantification of the spatial distribution of superparamagnetic iron-oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) with high temporal resolution (milliseconds), high spatial resolution (<1 mm), and extreme sensitivity (mu mol). The technique is based on nonlinear magnetization of the SPIONs when exposed to an oscillating magnetic field. MPI was first described in 2001. Since then, the technique has been applied to experimental imaging of diseases affecting different organs in the human body. The aim of this paper is to review the potential applications of MPI in the field of neurosurgery.
   METHODS: A nonsystematic review of the existing literature on the use of MPI in neurosurgical diseases was performed.
   RESULTS: MPI has been used for the detection of locoregional invasion of brain tumors, tracking, and monitoring the viability of neural stem cells implanted for neuroregenerative purposes, diagnosis of cerebral ischemia, and diagnosis and morphofunctional assessment of brain aneurysms.
   CONCLUSIONS: MPI is at a preclinical stage. In the future, human-sized MPI scanners, along with the optimal toxicity profile of SPIONs will allow diagnostic applications in neurosurgical diseases..

AB Labrune syndrome is a neurologic disorder that manifests as a progressive cerebral degeneration characterized by a radiologic triad of cerebral white matter disease (leukoencephalopathy), intracranial calcification, and cysts. The associated novel genetic mutation in SNORD118 has been recently identified. However, its significance in relation to the progression and severity of the disease is yet to be clarified. We present a 12-year-old boy with a 3-month history of headache that worsened 1 week before admission and was associated with nausea and vomiting, ataxia, and motor developmental delay. His head scans demonstrated widespread intracranial calcifications, cysts, leukoencephalopathy, and obstructive hydrocephalus. He had urgent endoscopic-assisted aspiration of the cerebellar cyst with insertion of a reservoir with resolution of the hydrocephalus and raised intracranial pressure symptoms. His genetic testing revealed a rare biallelic mutation with 2 variants in the gene SNORD118. The progressive form of this disease will be challenging for neurosurgeons.

AB BACKGROUND: Massive epistaxis from rupture of an intracavernous internal carotid artery aneurysm is a potentially fatal event. Although rare, this presentation is seen most often in patients after trauma or iatrogenic injury secondary to transsphenoidal surgery or radiation therapy.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present our unusual case of a patient with no significant risk factors who had recurrent epistaxis owing to a ruptured true cavernous internal carotid artery aneurysm. The patient was treated initially with coil embolization followed by placement of a Pipeline embolization device. The patient had complete resolution of her bleeding events. A follow-up arteriogram performed 14 months later confirmed aneurysm obliteration, with parent artery preservation and no evidence of in-stent stenosis.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our case highlights the importance of evaluating for intracranial pathological conditions in patients who present with refractory epistaxis. In selected patients, the use of flow-diversion technology as an adjunct or alternative to primary coil embolization for treatment should be considered.

AB BACKGROUND: Distal outflow occlusion and extracranial-intracranial bypass represent a possible option for the surgical management of complex middle cerebral artery (MCA) aneurysm. A limitation of the distal clipping strategy combined to bypass is related to the difficulties in predicting intraoperatively the good blood flow supply to the brain territory distal to the aneurysm and the extent and speed of aneurysmal thrombosis.
   METHODS: We present an innovative approach in which contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) and indocyanine green videoangiography (ICG-VA) have been synergistically used to study the effect of distal clipping on the aneurysm flow and the parenchymal blood flow after the bypass. We used this approach in a patient harboring a fusiform, partially thrombosed distal left MCA aneurysm.
   RESULTS: The patient was treated by a superficial temporal artery-MCA bypass, followed by MCA clipping immediately distally to the aneurysm. ICG-VA was used to evaluate bypass patency and brain perfusion in the area supplied by the bypass. CEUS was used to confirm the characteristics of the aneurysm and to explore the proximal MCA compartment immediately after dural opening, and to verify in real time the effect on aneurysm flow determined by distal outflow occlusion. Postoperative imaging confirmed aneurysm occlusion and patency of the bypass. The patient did not experience any neurologic sequelae.
   CONCLUSIONS: We present the first report of a synergistic intraoperative utilization of ICG-VA and CEUS in studying parenchymal perfusion and aneurysm flow in complex neurovascular procedures.

   REVASCULARIZATION; GIANT; COMPLICATIONS; MANAGEMENT; OUTCOMES
AB OBJECTIVE: Intracranial-intracranial (IC-IC) bypass with a graft vessel (IBGV) is a straightforward arterial reconstruction technique used for the treatment of complex aneurysms and skull base tumors. We have described the technical characteristics and summarized the clinical results of IBGV in complex cerebrovascular disorders.
   METHODS: We performed a search of the PubMed and Google Scholar online databases. The terms "intracranial-intracranial bypass," "jump graft bypass," "interposition graft bypass," "radial artery graft bypass," "saphenous vein graft bypass," and "superficial temporal artery graft bypass" were searched. Studies involving IBGV combined with other bypass methods were excluded. Illustrations of the technique have been provided to enhance comprehension.
   RESULTS: We identified 59 cases involving 6 types of graft vessels were identified from 1978 to July 2018. The IBGV technique was divided into the following 4 subtypes: type IA, in situ interposition graft bypass; type IB, Y-shaped double-barrel interposition graft bypass; type IIA, long jump graft bypass; and type IIB, Y-shaped double-barrel jump graft bypass. Grafts from the radial (44.1%; 26 of 59) and superficial temporal (39.3%; 22 of 59) arteries were used most frequently, and the middle cerebral artery territory was the most commonly involved region for IBGV. Of the cases with the specified postoperative characteristics, the graft patency and overall uneventful rates were 96.3% (52 of 54) and 82.2% (37 of 45), respectively. A higher patency rate (100% vs. 90.5%) and a lower complication rate (<20% vs. 60%) were observed with the type II group with an arterial graft.
   CONCLUSIONS: The IBGV method is a technically feasible option for vascular disease or complex cerebral tumors and should be considered by neurosurgeons. Long jump bypass with arterial grafts should be preferred when IC-IC bypass has been considered owing to the high rates of graft patency and favorable clinical outcomes.

On physical examination a firm swelling approximately 8 x 5 cm was present at the back of the neck just below the hair line. There was no focal neurologic deficit. Computed tomography scan of the cervical spine showed an additional bony arch attached to the spinous process of the C2 vertebra. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a soft tissue mass within the additional bony ring without involvement of neural structures. Complete surgical excision of the mass was done. Anomalous expansion of the spinous process of the C2 vertebra may remain silent. Surgery may be necessary for cosmetic purposes.

ID LANGERHANS-CELL HISTIOCYTOSIS; TERM-FOLLOW-UP; PERCUTANEOUS
   VERTEBROPLASTY; CORD COMPRESSION; MANAGEMENT; DIAGNOSIS; CHILDREN
AB OBJECTIVE: Spinal eosinophilic granulomas (EGs) are uncommon tumors, constituting <1% of all bone tumors. They are mostly seen in the pediatric age group, whereas adult onset is rare. The cervical spine is an infrequent location for EG. The literature is sparse regarding the clinical and management aspects of these lesions, especially in adults.
   METHODS: A literature review was performed by searching online databases to analyze all the reported cases of adult-onset cervical EG.
   RESULTS: Sixty-two cases were identified and analyzed. The male/female ratio was 3.1:1. The mean age at presentation was 32.8 years (range, 18-71 years). Neck pain, limb weakness, and restriction of movement were the most frequent symptoms. The C2 vertebra was the most frequently involved. The vertebral body was involved in >80% of patients and only 2 had vertebra plana morphology. The cervical lesions involved single vertebra in 42 patients (82%), whereas 9 patients (18%) had multiple vertebral involvement. Fifteen patients were managed conservatively, of whom 7 failed and required surgery later; 40 patients underwent definitive surgery and 17 received adjuvant treatment. Posterior-only surgeries were performed in 5 patients, anterior-only in 20, and circumferential in 14. The mean follow-up duration was 68 months (range, 12-268 months). The outcome was good to excellent in all, except 1, irrespective of type of treatment received.
   CONCLUSIONS: Cervical spine EG is rare in adults and usually presents as an osteolytic lesion involving the vertebral body; vertebra plana is very rare. Surgery is typically reserved for patients with severe neurologic deficits and bony instability. The outcome seems good in most cases.

DT Article

   Pneumatosis intestinalis; Ventriculoperitoneal shunt
ID BOWEL PERFORATION; CT FINDINGS; BEVACIZUMAB; COMPLICATIONS
AB BACKGROUND: Pneumoperitoneum after surgical manipulation of the abdomen implies a perforation. Rare cases of nonoperated cancer patients, largely with gastrointestinal or genitourinary cancers, have been noted to have radiologic findings of pneumatosis intestinalis and/or pneumoperitoneum as a complication of molecular-targeted therapy (MTT) without confounding factors for perforation. We present a patient with a cranial malignancy treated with bevacizumab who subsequently manifested with pneumatosis intestinalis.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 67-year-old man with metastatic melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and recurrent cerebellar subependymoma was initiated on bevacizumab treatment for subependymoma recurrence. He subsequently underwent an uncomplicated ventriculoperitoneal shunt for progressive obstructive hydrocephalus, confirmed by a normal postoperative abdominal radiograph. One week later, he returned with worsening lethargy and a computed tomography consistent with pneumomediastinum and pneumoperitoneum. Due to concern for bowel perforation, the patient underwent diagnostic laparoscopy and removal of ventriculoperitoneal shunt. Focal sigmoid pneumatosis was identified without any signs of bowel perforation or ischemia. Bevacizumab was discontinued, and the patient's radiologic and clinical findings improved.
   CONCLUSIONS: With increasing utilization of MTTs in brain tumor management, we raise MTT as a potential cause for pneumoperitoneum in neurosurgical patients. Pneumoperitoneum after extracranial procedures still requires workup and management for potential bowel perforation, but alternative causes such as bevacizumab should also be considered. Pneumatosis intestinalis patients on MTT can have benign physical examinations and will resolve, in the majority of cases, on discontinuation of the drug.

   disease
ID LONG-TERM PROGNOSIS; SPINAL HEMANGIOBLASTOMAS; IMPACT; CNS
AB BACKGROUND: Von-Hippel Lindau (VHL) disease is rare neurocutaneous disorder arising from an inactivating mutation of the VHL gene on chromosome 3p35. The disease is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion and predominantly involves tissues originating from the ectodermal germ layer. Although hemangioblastomas of retina and cerebellum are the most common clinical features, multiple-organ involvement in the form of renal cell carcinomas, spinal hemangioblastomas, renal cysts, and pancreatic cysts have also been reported. Hemangioblastomas of the spinal canal could present as cauda equina syndrome.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We describe the case of a 55-year-old man with cauda equina syndrome as his first manifestation. An initial magnetic resonance imaging scan uncovered hemangiomas in the spinal canal. A thorough family history strongly suggested an autosomal dominant pattern of disease inheritance. Further physical examination and imaging revealed additional organ involvement consistent with VHL. We performed laminectomy and partial resection of hemangioblastoma for decompression. He recovered satisfactorily with his cauda equina syndrome resolving quickly post operation. No deterioration was apparent by the 12-month follow-up visit.
   CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case with cauda equina syndrome as the first manifestation of VHL disease. Laminectomy and partial resection of hemangioblastoma are safe and effective treatments to resolve impingement of the spinal cord. VHL disease resulting in hemangioblastoma in the spinal canal is rarely seen but should be included in the differential diagnosis of cauda equina syndrome to facilitate genetic counseling for the proband and offspring.

   prevention; Traumatic brain injury
ID GLOBAL BURDEN; DISEASE
AB BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is major contributor to the global burden of disease, especially in low- and middle- income countries, where most TBIs are traffic-related. Evidence shows that helmets protect against severe TBI. Cambodia continues to have the greatest motorcycle fatality rate in Southeast Asia. We investigated whether the National Motorcycle Helmet Law introduced in January 2016 had an impact on the epidemiology of motorcycle-related TBI in a neurosurgical referral center in Phnom Penh.
   METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study of all patients admitted to the Department of Neurosurgery at Preah Kossamak Hospital with TBI following motorcycle accidents between January 2014 and December 2017.
   RESULTS: TBI admissions increased (from 234 in 2014 to 768 in 2017). The median age was 26 years, and most patients were male. The percentage of helmeted patients was 9% in 2014 and 13% in 2015; this increased to 18% in 2016, but dropped to 9% in 2017. Most TBIs occurred during the evening rush hour. Since 2016, more patients wore helmets in the daytime (up to 23%) than at night (5% between 1:00 and 5: 00 AM). Skull fracture, the most common pathology pre-law, decreased by 25% post-law (P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: With growing urbanization and motorization, TBI is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in Cambodia. Two years after helmets became compulsory, most patients with TBI are still unhelmeted. Likely contributing factors are low penalty for noncompliance and inconsistent law enforcement. TBI is a major public health problem warranting further efforts to understand how to improve prevention strategies and advocate for change.

AB BACKGROUND: Evidence to support the use of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) in the treatment of epilepsy secondary to cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) is emerging. However, these studies have not clearly demonstrated the use of SRS in the treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) in high Spetzler-Martin grade (IV-V) AVMs.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a 48-year-old woman with DRE secondary to a Spetzler-Martin grade V cerebral AVM. She was treated with volume-staged SRS (VS-SRS) and achieved near-complete resolution of her seizures with incomplete obliteration of the AVM. Six years after treatment, she has experienced no serious complications.
   CONCLUSIONS: VS-SRS successfully controlled seizures (Engel Outcome Measure of 1A) in a patient with intractable, DRE secondary to a high-grade cerebral AVM.

   Spinal Approaches: Technical Note
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Paraspinal muscles; Posterior spinal approaches; Surgical
   instrumentation; Surgical smoke
ID SCOLIOSIS; SURGEONS; SINGLE; FUSION
AB BACKGROUND: During dissection of paraspinal muscles in posterior surgical approaches, the spine surgeon usually holds a subperiosteal (Cobb) elevator in 1 hand and a monopolar cautery in the other hand. In such a scenario, both the surgical smoke generated by the monopolar and eventual bleeding constitute a significant hindrance to simultaneous bilateral dissection of the paraspinal muscles by 2 surgeons.
   METHODS: To address the identified shortcomings in the currently available instrumentation, we initially analyzed the most common surgical techniques employed by residents and fellows at our institution for paraspinal muscle dissection during posterior spinal approaches. Additionally, we collected trainees' feedback regarding the efficacy of available strategies for dealing with surgical smoke.
   RESULTS: A new coupled Cobb elevator-suction instrument was designed, manufactured, and tested by residents, fellows, and experienced spine surgeons, and small additional design modifications were performed.
   CONCLUSIONS: We present what we believe is the first description of a new coupled Cobb-suction instrument that has been developed to enable simultaneous retraction and suction with 1 hand, while allowing the spine surgeon to use the monopolar cautery with the other hand. In our preliminary institutional experience, this new tool has been proven to be especially useful in long posterior spinal approaches in the thoracolumbar region.

AB BACKGROUND: We describe a patient affected by a T-cell primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) with highly aberrant specific B-cell markers (CD79a and CD20). An unusual imaging presentation leads us to misdiagnose this lesion for a meningioma and perform surgical resection.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We think that this infrequent anatomic presentation might be due to the aberrant specific B-cell markers (CD79a and CD20) genotype expression. We believe this case to be relevant in order to appreciate the diagnosis of cerebral lymphomas according to various presentations. We wonder whether it was not the aberrant genotype that contributed to this quirky presentation and ultimately if surgery in PCNSL should not be discussed?
   CONCLUSIONS: Furthermore, this case calls attention to the complexity of lineage assignment, imaging diagnosis, and treatment strategy in PCNSL.

On imaging, he was found to have left-sided acute on chronic subdural hematoma with midline shift. The patient underwent surgical evacuation of the hematoma and the subdural membrane was biopsied. Histopathologic examination revealed metastatic poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of unclear origin. A full metastatic workup was unremarkable.
   CONCLUSIONS: Metastatic subdural hematoma with dural metastasis should be included in differential diagnosis of subdural hematoma, especially in patients with atypical presentation and in the presence of an underlying malignancy, as it may affect the management plan and overall survival.

ID VASCULAR INJURY; ENDOVASCULAR TREATMENT; DISKECTOMY
AB BACKGROUND: Vascular injury complications during lumbar discectomy are rare but potentially life-threatening. Therefore, an early diagnosis and effective treatment management is required for these complications.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 50-year-old female patient was admitted to our outpatient clinic with severe back and right leg pain. She underwent surgery for right L4-5 extruded disc herniation with general anesthesia. Sudden arterial hemorrhage occurred during discectomy performed with straight disc forceps and was controlled using hemostatic materials, with no significant decrease in blood pressure. However, the patient became hypotensive near the end of the operation. The incision was quickly closed, and she was turned to supine position. Emergency abdominal ultrasound, computed tomography, and computed tomography angiography revealed an injury of the left main iliac artery, which was repaired by endovascular stenting. Laparotomy and Bogota bag were applied because of increased intrabdominal pressure at 3 hours postoperative. In addition, a retroperitoneal catheter was placed into the area of the right retroperitoneal hematoma on the first postoperative day. Tissue plasminogen activator was administered through the catheter. On postoperative day 3, the Bogota bag was removed, and the abdomen was closed. The patient was discharged without neurodeficit on day 27. Her abdominal fascial defect was closed with a synthetic graft after 5 months.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although lumbar discectomy is one of the most commonly performed neurosurgical procedures, the routine rules of discectomy should not be neglected. Early detection and a multidisciplinary approach can help prevent mortality in the event of vascular injury.

DE Myeloproliferative disorders; Polycythemia vera; Subdural hematoma
ID INITIAL PRESENTATION
AB BACKGROUND: Polycythemia vera (PV) is a myeloproliferative disorder usually characterized by an increase tendency toward thromboembolic events. Spontaneous hemorrhage/bleeding in PV patients is seldom reported in neurosurgical literature.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report the case of a 76-year-old male with PV who developed a spontaneous subdural hematoma requiring surgical evacuation. He improved significantly after the resolution of brain compression and mass effect caused by the hematoma.
   CONCLUSIONS: Sporadic reports of hemorrhage within the central nervous system in the setting of PV exist and are attributed to microvascular thrombotic events with hemorrhagic conversion. Though rare, spontaneous central nervous system hemorrhage in the absence of vascular malformation or an inciting event such as trauma can occur in the setting of myeloproliferative disorders like PV.

DE Posterior fossa meningioma; Transverse sinus; Venous sinus
ID LONG-TERM OUTCOMES; TENTORIAL MENINGIOMAS; SURGICAL EXPERIENCE;
   PETROCLIVAL; RADIOSURGERY
AB OBJECTIVE: To define, from a series of surgically treated meningiomas of the posterior fossa with dural attachment above the dural sinuses, the best management of the sinus invasion according to the pattern of venous circulation.
   METHODS: Seventy-five patients with posterior fossa meningioma whose dural attachment involved the major venous sinuses were included in the study. We considered tumor location and dural attachment, pattern of venous sinus circulation, degree of sinus involvement and its management, entity of surgical resection, complications, and recurrences.
   RESULTS: The resection of the involved sinus segment (Simpson I) was performed in 15 patients (20%) (10 with complete occlusion and pattern of circulation of types A and B and 5 with narrowed sinus and type B circulation); 42 cases (56%, all of type 1) were treated by coagulation and/or removal of the outer dural layer (Simpson II). In 14 (19%) the intrasinusal fragment was left (Simpson III), and in 4 (5%) the resection was partial, with residual intradural tumor (Simpson IV). No postoperative complications secondary to venous obstruction occurred. Eleven patients (15%) experienced tumor recurrence and were reoperated on. Only 4 of them with extensive dural invasion had further recurrence.
   CONCLUSIONS: In patients with posterior fossa meningiomas, we suggest to safety resect the involved sinus segment only when completely occluded. If the sinus lumen is not invaded or the tumor lies on the side of the unique or dominant transverse sinus, it should be preserved. This results in no or negligible risk of venous infarction and rather low recurrence rate.

DE Intraventricular meningioma; Lacunar stroke; Lateral posterior choroidal
   artery; Transient ischemic attack; Transient tumor attack
AB BACKGROUND: Transient tumor attack is a rare but well-known phenomenon. Described by Ross in 1983, it demonstrated a transient ischemic attack-like picture in patients with intracranial mass lesions. Usually these attacks were recognized at sites anatomically away from the primary lesion that were not explained by primary mass effect of the lesion. The exact pathophysiology of such transient tumor attacks is postulated to be due to either a vascular steal phenomenon or compression of a vessel or localized prothrombotic state.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Here we describe a case who was being evaluated for a lacunar stroke involving the lateral geniculate body, and a surprising finding of left intraventricular meningioma was detected.
   CONCLUSIONS: We try to shed some light on the pathophysiology of this unusual phenomenon.

AB BACKGROUND: Nontraumatic atlantoaxial subluxation, also known as Grisel syndrome, is a rare disease that usually affects children. The typical presentation is torticollis in patients with a history of surgical operations or airway infections.
   METHODS: We describe 5 patients with Grisel syndrome, referring to medical care for a torticollis, a few weeks after an airway infection, with no trauma associated. Radiologic confirmation of the diagnosis, with computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging studies, was carried out.
   RESULTS: The patients were treated with external immobilization for 3 months, followed by surgical fixation in the case of recurrence after collar removal or inveterate subluxation. We performed a review of the literature to define the best management of this disease.
   CONCLUSIONS: Management of Grisel syndrome depends on the degree of subluxation basing on the Fielding and Hawkins classification. The initial nonsurgical management consists of close reduction and immobilization. Surgical fixation is indicated in cases of conservative treatment failure.

ID TYROSINE-KINASE INHIBITOR; ACTIVATION; IMATINIB
AB BACKGROUND: Dasatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor commonly used in treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and chronic myelogenous leukemia, is often associated with hemorrhagic complications. Safety of dasatinib after thrombolytic therapy in acute ischemic stroke is unknown.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 63-year-old man with multiple vascular risk factors and chronic myelogenous leukemia (in molecular remission) on dasatinib presented with signs and symptoms of right hemispheric stroke owing to acute intracranial internal carotid artery occlusion that was treated with intravenous thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy resulting in near-complete resolution of stroke symptoms. The patient developed clinical worsening (>24 hours of thrombolytic therapy) after receiving a second dose of dasatinib that was due to symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage and necessitated decompressive hemi-craniectomy. Routine coagulation profile was normal. The etiology of this hemorrhagic complication was likely secondary to primary platelet dysfunction due to dasatinib as reported in some recent in vitro and ex vivo studies.
   CONCLUSIONS: It is advisable to withhold dasatinib during the poststroke period owing to its associated risk of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage.

AB BACKGROUND: Autism spectrum disorder represents a set of developmental disorders characterized by lack of social interaction and verbal and nonverbal communication in the first 3 years of life. It is also associated with several comorbidities, including epilepsy, aggression, self-mutilating behavior, and obsessive-compulsive behavior. In some cases, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) develops. The nucleus accumbens (NAc) plays a key role in reward circuitry and is involved in the control of OCD and aggression.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 42-year-old woman with autism was offered NAc deep brain stimulation for her comorbidities of OCD and aggression. The NAc was targeted using standard stereotactic methods, and postoperative scans confirmed the position of the active electrode to be within the NAc. The patient experienced significant symptom relief. At 1-year follow-up, the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale score for OCD, excluding items 1-5 of the scale, improved from 19 to 5. Hamilton Depression Scale and Hamilton Anxiety Scale scores similarly improved from 20 to 15 and from 30 to 18, respectively. Social Communication Questionnaire Current version for autism score improved from 26 to 16. Subscores for reciprocal social interactionimproved from 13 to 8; for communication improved from 5 to 4; and for restricted, repetitive, and stereotyped patterns of behavior improved from 6 to 3.
   CONCLUSIONS: This case report illustrated the role of the NAc in OCD and aggression in an autistic patient. We discussed the role of the NAc as a target to explain the outcome of this case.

TI Neurosurgical and Scalp Reconstructive Challenges During Craniotomy in
   the Setting of Cutis Verticis Gyrata
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY

ID REDUCTION
AB BACKGROUND: Cutis verticis gyrata (CVG) is a rare condition of the scalp in which thickening of the dermis induces rigid folds and furrows resembling the cerebral cortex. Two forms of primary CVG exist: essential, in which CVG is the only presenting problem, and nonessential, in which the scalp condition occurs along with neuropsychiatric ailments. CVG can also occur secondary to a variety of causes including inflammatory, neoplastic, and metabolic conditions or drug use. A review of the available literature, including description of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, histology, and typical management of CVG, is provided. However, we identified no literature describing the complications of CVG in the setting of a craniotomy.
   CASE REPORT: The patient presented here is a 54-year-old man with CVG who presented with occlusion of the M2/M2 branches of the middle cerebral artery, resulting in malignant cerebral edema, requiring emergent management via decompressive craniectomy. Because of the thickening of the scalp, skin incision was complicated by bleeding and difficulty in achieving hemostasis using Raney clips. Plastic surgery was consulted intraoperatively for assistance with complex closure of the wound in a multilayered fashion. Despite this, the patient's postoperative course was complicated by cerebrospinal fluid leakage due to difficulty in approximating the incision during closure. Subsequent cranioplasty was performed jointly between neurosurgery and plastic surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: Despite its rarity, CVG is an important issue for neurosurgeons to understand as it can present complications in performing craniotomy, most notably during the scalp exposure and closure. CVG may also complicate the postoperative course if adequate approximation of the tissues cannot be achieved, resulting in wound infection and/or cerebrospinal fluid leak. The presented patient benefited from a combined neurosurgical and plastic surgical approach that was implemented intraoperatively and continued through the postoperative stages and the subsequent cranioplasty.

AB Acquired (nontraumatic) brain herniation through the ethmoid is rarely associated with an intracranial mass away from the anterior skull base. A 55-year-old diabetic woman presented with progressive frontal headache, anosmia, and blurred vision without rhinorrhea. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed an intracranial tumor of the left frontal convexity associated with a herniation of the frontal brain (encephalocele) into the left nasal cavity. A computed tomography scan confirmed the anterior skull base defect. The intracranial tumor was totally excised after a left frontal craniotomy with a good outcome. Pathologic examination revealed a meningothelial meningioma. However, the patient and her family refused any surgery for the ethmoidal encephalocele. In our case report, this rare phenomenon (secondary nontraumatic encephalocele) probably occurred due to long-term increase of the intracranial pressure generated by the meningioma.

DT Article
DE Ectopic pituitary adenoma; Ga-68-Dotatate; Hyperthyroidism; PET/CT; TSH
AB BACKGROUND: Ectopic thyroid-secreting hormone (TSH) esecreting pituitary adenomas are rare, with only 9 cases reported in the literature.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We describe a case of an ectopic TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma located in the nasopharynx in a patient initially presenting with signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism that persisted despite treatment with antithyroid medications. Magnetic resonance imaging of the pituitary gland was normal, although subsequent review by a neuroradiologist revealed a nodule attached to the posterior septum in the nasopharynx that was, in retrospect, seen on several other magnetic resonance imaging scans. Gallium 68 (Ga-68) DOTATATE positron emission tomography/computed tomography showed increased uptake in the nasopharyngeal nodule. The patient underwent resection of the nasopharyngeal mass with remission of hyperthyroidism. On pathology, the resected mass stained positive for TSH and prolactin.
   CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of use of Ga-68-DOTATATE positron emission tomography/computed tomography to aid in localizing an ectopic TSH-secreting tumor. Prior studies have shown that Ga-68-DOTATATE positron emission tomography/computed tomography improves detection of small lesions with shorter imaging times and lower radiation doses compared with other modalities. Our case emphasizes the importance of using Ga-68-DOTATATE PET/CT in the diagnosis of ectopic pituitary adenomas, as these tumors can be challenging to diagnose radiographically.

TI Brain Mesh: Technical Note
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY

DT Article
DE Brain; Brain mesh; Cortex; Electrostimulation mapping; Functional brain
   mapping; Surgical technique
AB BACKGROUND: Standard electrostimulation cortical mapping includes application of electrical current to the explored areas through an electrode and marking of functional zones by means of paper tags with different symbols. This approach has several disadvantages. First, the electrode is moved randomly. It leads to overlooking of some zones, which causes mapping deficiency, and restimulation of others, which can trigger epileptic seizures. Second, the tags easily shift and close the marked structures. We describe a new simple device that provides precise cortical mapping without indicated problems and the technique to apply it.
   METHODS: The device is a flexible polymer mesh with square pores of a certain size. The neurosurgeon applies the mesh onto the brain cortex and sequentially stimulates it through the pores. The functional areas are labeled. Pores corresponding to the lesion are cut out, and the lesion is removed through the cutout without removing the mesh. After operation, the mesh is removed.
   RESULTS: Using this technique, we operated on a patient with a glioma located near the primary motor cortex. The accessible cortical area was accurately mapped, and the tumor was resected without any complications. The mesh allowed us to significantly streamline the mapping process.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our case illustrates that the proposed invention can be successfully used in neurosurgical operations for precise electrostimulation mapping of the brain cortex.

ID DYSTONIA; WEAKNESS; EFFICACY; SAFETY; PAIN
AB BACKGROUND: Botulinum toxin (Botox) has long been used therapeutically to treat a variety of diseases, including migraine headaches, cervical spine dystonia, and chronic cervical spine pain, among many others. Although quite useful, Botox has been reported to cause adverse events, some of which may lead to devastating morbidity.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: An elderly woman presented with severe neck pain after a motor vehicle collision. She underwent Botox administration to the neck extensor muscles, after which she developed severe cervical kyphotic deformity, a complication previously reported only in patients with a history of cervical fusion. In addition, the patient had a pre-existing cervical spine degenerative disc disease with listhesis resulting in cervical kyphotic deformity and loss of cervical lordosis.
   CONCLUSIONS: This case illustrates a potential danger of using Botox in the neck of an elderly patient who may have pre-existing cervical spine instability, underlying cervical musculature weakness, and pre-existing cervical kyphosis. It demonstrates the need to evaluate patients who are predisposed to developing cervical kyphotic deformities before offering them Botox treatment.

AB BACKGROUND: Carotid artery restenosis after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or carotid artery stenting (CAS) will occur in 3%-30% of cases. Restenosis can lead to more frequent clinical and imaging monitoring and the potential for reoperation. We sought to define the demographic, clinical, and radiographic characteristics that influence the restenosis risk after carotid revascularization.
   METHODS: The present study was performed in accordance with the PRISMA (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses) guidelines. A random effects model meta-analysis of hazard ratios (HRs) was conducted.
   RESULTS: Eighteen studies with 17,106 patients were included. Diabetes (HR, 1.68; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.00-2.83; I-2, 76.7%), dyslipidemia (HR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.08-2.91; I-2, 22.5%), female gender (HR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.14-1.98, I-2, 0%), chronic kidney disease (HR, 4.15; 95% CI, 1.69-10.19; I-2, 44.5%), hypertension (HR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.07-3.72; I-2, 68%), smoking (HR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.15-2.37; I-2, 54.3%), and pretreatment stenosis >70% (HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.0-1.08; I-2, 0%) showed a statistically significant increase in restenosis risk after carotid revascularization. Subgroup analyses of CEA and CAS showed that female gender and smoking status were significantly associated with recurrent stenosis after CEA but not after CAS. In contrast, hypertension was associated with restenosis after CAS but not after CEA. Patch endarterectomy (HR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.22-0.50; I-2, 0%) and symptomatic status at presentation in the CAS group (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.41-0.90; I-2, 0%) were associated with a decreased risk of restenosis. Antiplatelet use and coronary artery disease were not associated with restenosis risk.
   CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes, dyslipidemia, female gender, renal failure, hypertension, and smoking were associated with an increased risk of restenosis, and patch endarterectomy and symptomatic status at presentation were associated with a decreased risk of carotid restenosis. Both female gender and current smoking status were only associated with recurrent stenosis after CEA, and hypertension was only associated with restenosis after CAS.

AB OBJECTIVE: Unilateral biportal endoscopic spine surgery (UBE) for the treatment of lumbar spinal diseases has achieved favorable results. In this systematic review, the technical nuances, surgical outcomes, and complications of UBE are summarized.
   METHODS: A systematic review of the literature published to June 2018 was performed. Reported studies related to UBE were identified through searching the PubMed database. The outcomes measured included operative time, hospital stay, complications, visual analog scale (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index, and the Macnab criteria.
   RESULTS: A total of 556 patients and 679 levels were collected from the selected 11 studies. The mean follow-up was 15.2 months, the mean operative time was 81.3 minutes, and the mean length of hospital stay was 4.4 days. The mean overall complication rate was 6.7% (range, 0%-13.8%). The mean VAS score for leg pain decreased from preoperative 7.9 to 1.9 at final follow-up visit and the mean VAS score for back pain decreased from 5.7 to 1.8. The mean Oswestry Disability Index significantly improved from preoperative 63.7 to 18.6 at the final follow-up. The average satisfied outcome (excellent/good; based on the Macnab criteria) was 84.3% (range, 75.35%-95%). There were similar results between UBE for the treatment of lumbar disc herniation and stenosis, including operative time, length of hospital stay, complications, and satisfaction rate.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although the existing studies are limited to small cohorts and short-term follow-up, based on the given preliminary results and experiences of current studies, UBE may be a feasible option for lumbar spinal surgery.

ID SKILLS
AB BACKGROUND: The art of surgery is becoming increasingly complex and dependent on scopes, screens, and technology, inviting a complex learning curve and development of hand-eye coordination and dexterity among other skills. We introduce an affordable, do-it-yourself microsurgical simulator that can be set up using a smartphone and a pair of reflective prism glasses. The glasses employ periscopic prisms on either side that reflect light perpendicularly. When the visual input is combined with the magnification of a smartphone camera, a real-time microsurgical experience can be simulated.
   METHODS: We analyzed the performance of 2 trainee residents in performing their first 5 successful sutures with 5-0 polypropylene thread on the cut ends of a glove over the course of 3 months. The module was also assessed in a survey at an international conference of neurosurgeons.
   RESULTS: A significant improvement was observed in both residents at the end of each month versus baseline (P < 0.05). Of 27 survey participants, 3 (11%) reported access to a training laboratory in their institute. The module was rated 4/5 in terms of hand-eye coordination, 3.5/5 in management of microsurgical field, and 3.5/5 in depth perception.
   CONCLUSIONS: The microsurgical simulation technique proved to be useful in performing complex microsurgical tasks. A significant improvement in microsurgical skills was observed among our trainees. The cost of building the module can be as low as U.S. $5. We endorse the use of this technique for resident training and skill development, especially in resource-challenged environments.

AB OBJECTIVE: Hemimasticatory spasm (HMS) is a rare masticatory muscle disorder. Drug therapy, microvascular decompression, and botulinum toxin have had varying efficacy and adverse effects. We have reported the cases of 2 patients who had undergone a novel therapy for HMS, based on endoscope-assisted nerve avulsion of the masseter nerve attached to the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disc.
   METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of 2 patients with HMS who had undergone surgery from June 2014 to June 2017 at the oral surgery department of Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital affiliated to Shanghai JiaoTong University School of Medicine. Both patients had undergone endoscope-assisted avulsion of the masseter nerve attached to the TMJ disc. Both patients were evaluated by electromyography postoperatively and were followed up for 36 months after surgery.
   RESULTS: Both patients had had all the signs and symptoms of HMS. The HMS had resolved immediately after surgery. At 1 week after surgery, electromyography revealed that the high-frequency group discharge potential in the motor unit accompanying the spasm was no longer present, and the effect was maintained for the 36-month follow-up period. These results indicated a good curative effect. Electromyography also showed strength weakness and mild shape atrophy of the masseter muscle on the affected side.
   CONCLUSIONS: Endoscope-assisted avulsion of the masseter nerve attached to the TMJ disc showed a good curative effect, little trauma, few complications, and a quick postoperative recovery. It could be used as an alternative treatment of HMS for selected patients.

ID SPINAL-CORD; HEMANGIOBLASTOMAS; TUMORS
AB BACKGROUND: Intramedullary capillary hemangiomas are rare lesions with only 14 cases reported so far and are found in middle-aged persons. Until now only a single case has been reported in the pediatric population. Ours was the second pediatric case and the youngest of all to be diagnosed with an intramedullary capillary hemangioma.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We are reporting the case of a 2-month male child who presented with features of hydrocephalus and spastic paraparesis. On magnetic resonance imaging he had features suggestive of a D10-11 intradural extramedullary lesion and hydrocephalus. We did a ventriculoperitoneal shunt followed by excision of the lesion in the same sitting. Intraoperatively it was found to be an intramedullary lesion, and histopathologic examination showed features suggestive of capillary hemangioma. Postoperatively he recovered well and there is no recurrence 18 months after surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: Intramedullary capillary hemangiomas are extremely rare lesions in infants but should be kept in mind while treating any patient with the spinal lesion. Further reporting of similar cases will help in understanding the natural history, pathogenesis, and management.

TI Atypical Manifestation of Direct Low-Flow Carotid-Cavernous Fistula:
   Case Report and Review of the Literature
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Review
DE Carotid-cavernous fistula; Cavernous segment of internal carotid artery;
   Cavernous sinus; External carotid artery
ID CLINICAL PRESENTATION; SINUS FISTULA
AB BACKGROUND: Carotid cavernous fistula (CCF) is a rare type of arteriovenous shunt that develops within the cavernous sinus (CS). Direct CCFs entail a direct communication between the cavernous internal carotid artery and the CS and are typically high-flow lesions. Most CCFs drain into the ophthalmic veins (typical venous drainage pattern), leading to the pathognomic ocular clinical triad associated with a CCF. When an obstruction of the typical venous outflow is present, the arterial pressure generated by the fistula is transmitted into the cerebral venous system via the sphenoparietal sinus, which might lead to intracerebral hemorrhage. We present a rare case of posttraumatic, direct, low-flow CCF associated with cerebral hemorrhage, a typical venous drainage pattern, and without ocular symptoms at presentation.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 76-year-old woman was hospitalized for a posttraumatic frontotemporopolar hemorrhage associated with multiple fractures of the maxillofacial and cranial base skeleton and midline shift >10 mm. On neurologic examination the Glasgow Coma Scale was 8 and right anisocoria was present. Immediate surgical evacuation of the hematoma was performed. Severe arterial bleeding from the anterior third of the middle cranial fossa floor was controlled intraoperatively. Postoperative brain angio - magnetic resonance imaging and digital subtraction angiography showed a direct CCF without theft phenomenon. Ocular symptoms, and ultimately loss of function of the right eye, appeared 2 weeks from surgery. Endovascular treatment of the CCF was attempted attaining partial closure of the shunt using coils.
   CONCLUSIONS: Direct low-flow CCFs are exceedingly rare lesions. Five cases have been described in the literature, 4 of which were associated with spontaneous rupture of a cavernous carotid aneurysm while only 1 case was associated with posttraumatic rupture of a cavernous internal carotid artery pseudoaneurysm. In addition, despite our patient having developed an intraparenchymal hemorrhage most probably correlated to the CCF, the latter was associated with a typical venous drainage via the superior ophthalmic vein, which is uncommonly correlated to intraparenchymal bleeding.

ID LENGTH-OF-STAY; CEREBRAL ANEURYSMS; UNITED-STATES; EMBOLIZATION
AB OBJECTIVES: Rupture of unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIA) is the main cause for subarachnoid hemorrhage. UIA are widespread among the population. Advanced technology enables us to diagnose UIAs with increasing reliability and subsequently treat them. There are 2 main treatment options: surgical clipping and endovascular treatment of the aneurysm. This article aims to analyze costs of neurosurgical clipping and the endovascular approach to treat UIA, and to give an overview over the existing literature.
   METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted using the databases Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, and NHS EED. Articles were divided into 2 groups based on the perspective from which costs were evaluated (health care provider or payer). Costs were inflated to the year 2015 and converted to international dollars.
   RESULTS: The literature search yielded 137 different articles out of which 15 have been considered relevant and have been included in this review. Not only absolute numbers but also the cost ratio of both treatment modalities showed substantial variations. The coiling procedure tends to be more expensive for health care providers but cheaper for cost bearers. Without any exception, the authors determined shorter lengths of stay for patients who underwent the coiling procedure.
   CONCLUSIONS: Due to different definitions of hospital costs and hardly reproducible calculations, comparability of the stated numbers is limited. Besides the economic impact, outcomes must be considered when making a treatment decision. The 2 treatment modalities are not equally suitable in every patient nor for every aneurysm location.

TI The Management of Hypertension in Pre-Aneurysmal Treatment Subarachnoid

SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Review
DE Aneurysmal; Hypertension; Subarachnoid hemorrhage
ID DELAYED CEREBRAL-ISCHEMIA; BLOOD-PRESSURE; PULSE PRESSURE; MORTALITY;
   THERAPY; IMPACT
AB BACKGROUND: Management of hypertension in subarachnoid hemorrhage patients within the preaneurysmal treatment period remains ambiguous, in part due to the lack of high-level, evidence-based guidelines. Despite this, current recommendations offer guidance regarding certain parameters (e.g., mean arterial pressure, systolic blood pressure). However, managing hypertension within this critical period is difficult because a fine balance must be achieved between lowering blood pressure enough to minimize the risk of rebleeding and preventing reduced cerebral perfusion and subsequent ischemic damage. Furthermore, the different causes of hypertension within the preaneurysmal treatment period are polyfactorial and include pathophysiologic responses, sympathetic nervous system activation, and iatrogenic from hyperdynamic therapy and vasopressors, which requires consideration for these patients to receive optimal management. Other factors including loss of autoregulation and concomitant conditions must also be considered when deciding whether to start antihypertensive therapy.
   METHODS: We review the literature and provide a comprehensive update on management of hypertension within the preaneurysmal treatment period, which we hope stresses the need for better evidence-based guidelines that will in turn help manage this cohort.
   RESULTS: Thorough review revealed no high-grade, evidence-based guidelines to manage these patients, which results in variation in clinical practice among different clinicians and institutions. Despite this, current recommendations seem reasonable until such guidelines are established.
   CONCLUSIONS: It is clear that further, larger studies are warranted in order to clarify the effect of antihypertensive therapy on patient outcome and what the BP thresholds are, along with establishing the best treatment, for commencing antihypertensive therapy.

DT Article
DE Cement; Kyphoplasty; Pediatric; Traumatic fracture
ID CALCIUM-PHOSPHATE CEMENT
AB BACKGROUND: Kyphoplasty is commonly employed in the treatment of compression fractures in the elderly and is increasingly used in the treatment of adult trauma along with concomitant instrumentation. Although kyphoplasty with instrumentation has been reported in pediatric patients, concerns regarding retardation of spinal growth and iatrogenic spinal deformity have been raised. The utilization of kyphoplasty without instrumentation has yet to be reported in the case of pediatric patients.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 13-year-old male presented to the emergency department with a traumatic L2 burst fracture with 50% loss of height, which continued to cause severe pain after a trial of bracing. He was subsequently treated with a kyphoplasty without instrumentation. He experienced a rapid and excellent recovery and resumed all previous activity.
   CONCLUSIONS: Kyphoplasty alone without instrumentation is a less invasive means to treat these patients and also prevents iatrogenic deformity or retardation of growth in the pediatric spine.

AB Brainstem arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) represent similar to 5% of all intracranial AVMs and carry a higher risk of hemorrhage than their supratentorial counterparts. There is a high and near-uniform mortality with initial and recurrent episodes of hemorrhage. Brainstem AVMs may also present symptomatically with focal neurologic deficits or hydrocephalus. Treatment is indicated for ruptured and symptomatic brainstem AVMs, as well as those possessing high-risk angioarchitectural features. Microsurgical resection and stereotactic radiosurgery are ideal therapeutic options when feasible. Embolization is most commonly used as adjunctive treatment before surgery or stereotactic radiosurgical irradiation. Preoperative embolization facilitates microsurgical resection and reduces intraoperative and postoperative hemorrhage rates. Use of embolization preradiosurgically helps to reduce nidal size, transforming a large lesion to a size amenable to radiosurgical intervention, increasing the probability of obliteration, decreasing procedural hemorrhage risk, stabilizing the lesion until radiotherapeutic effect achieves obliteration, and providing interval symptomatic resolution. Embolization may also be used effectively as stand-alone monotherapy for small lesions with 1 or 2 arterial feeders not supplying eloquent parenchyma. Although an extensive evidence base exists for clinical usefulness of stereotactic radiosurgery as monotherapy or in combination with other therapeutic modalities, only a few studies have reported specifically on obliteration and complication rates with monotherapeutic embolization in the treatment of brainstem AVMs. The potential role of embolization as monotherapy for brainstem AVMs is reviewed and discussed.

AB OBJECTIVE: The first-line treatment of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is systemic anticoagulation. However, patients with severe or a clinically worsening condition might benefit from mechanical thrombectomy (MT) combined with intraoperative thrombolysis (IOT) or MT with continuous thrombolytic infusion (CTI). The present study compared the efficacy and safety of these 2 endovascular therapeutic methods by performing a systematic review of the literature.
   METHODS: The present systematic review was conducted to identify all cases of CVST treated with MT+IOT or MT+CTI/MT+IOT+CTI reported in PubMed and Ovid. The recanalization rates, outcomes, operation-related complications, sequelae, and postoperative hemorrhage rates were evaluated.
   RESULTS: A total of 28 studies, including 82 patients, met the inclusion criteria. Alone, MT+IOT was performed in 42 patients (51%), and MT+CTI/MT+IOT+CTI was performed in 40 patients (49%). Overall, outcomes data were available for 69 patients, of whom 57 (82%) had had a good outcome and 12 (18%) had had a poor outcome or had died. Recanalization data were available for 68 patients. Of these patients, 28 (41%) had had complete recanalization, 40 (59%) had had partial, and no patient had had no recanalization. Operation-related complications occurred in 5 patients (6%), and 3 patients (4%) developed postoperative intracerebral hemorrhage. However, no significant differences were found in the recanalization rate or prognosis between the MT+IOT and MT+CTI/MT+IOTDCTI groups.
   CONCLUSIONS: The results from our review suggest that MT with local thrombolysis is relatively safe, with no significant differences in efficacy and safety between MT+IOT alone and MT+CTI/MT+IOT+CTI. However, randomized controlled studies are required to provide a definitive answer on its use for CVST.

AB BACKGROUND: Intramedullary spinal cord tumors (IMSCT) comprise the least common types of spinal neoplasms; surgery is mostly conducted with intraoperative neuromonitoring (IONM). However, although IONM is widely used to prevent neurologic damage and many single-center studies have been reported, the added value, in terms of overall sensitivity and specificity, of different monitoring techniques used in IMSCT surgery remains to be clearly defined.
   OBJECTIVE: To summarize and review the reported evidence on the use of IONM in IMSCT surgery, including our own case series (n = 75 patients).
   METHODS: We systematically searched the literature published from January 2000 to February 2018. Articles included patients with IMSCT who underwent surgery with neuromonitoring. We estimated the sensitivity, specificity, 95% confidence interval (CI), positive likelihood ratio, and negative likelihood ratio.
   RESULTS: Of 1385 eligible articles, 31 were included in the systematic review. Fifteen of these articles were used for a meta-analysis, complemented with our own case series. All neuromonitoring modalities showed acceptable but not optimal test characteristics. For the indications used in the different studies, the motor evoked potentials approach showed the highest sensitivity (0.838; 95% CI, 0.703-0.919) and the best specificity (0.829; 95% CI, 0.668-0.921) for detecting neuronal injury. In our own case series, the extent of resection was significantly smaller in the false-positive group than in the true-negative group (P = 0.045).
   CONCLUSIONS: IONM showed high but not perfect sensitivity and specificity. IONM prevents neurologic damage but can also limit the extent of tumor resection. Prospective studies will have to define the definitive value of IONM.

TI Intracranial Administration of Nicardipine After Aneurysmal Subarachnoid
   Hemorrhage: A Review of the Literature

ID PROLONGED-RELEASE IMPLANTS; CEREBRAL VASOSPASM; INTRAVENTRICULAR
   NICARDIPINE; NIMODIPINE; ISCHEMIA
AB BACKGROUND: Intrathecal (IT), intraventricular (IVt), and intracisternal administration of nicardipine deliver treatment directly into the central nervous system. This route of drug delivery is being investigated as a potential treatment of vasospasm following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH).
   OBJECTIVE: The authors reviewed the existing literature regarding the direct administration of nicardipine into the intracranial space for the treatment of vasospasm following aSAH.
   METHODS: An electronic search of literature published between 1994 and 2018 was performed using PubMed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis guidelines. A variety of combinations of the search terms "intrathecal nicardipine," "intraventricular nicardipine," and "nicardipine prolonged-release" were used.
   RESULTS: A total of 17 studies were included in this systematic review, 3 of which were studies in animals. The studies consistently demonstrated that IT nicardipine successfully reverses vasospasm, but the effect, as shown in some studies, was limited to the immediate vicinity of drug release. The data regarding long-term clinical outcomes are variable, with some studies demonstrating marked improvement whereas others fail to demonstrate improved outcomes when compared with patients who receive standard of care. Although adverse sequalae were uncommon, IT and IVt administration and therapy were associated with adverse effects including headache, meningitis, and hydrocephalus.
   CONCLUSIONS: Given the findings presented in these studies, IT, IVt, and intracisternal (pellet) nicardipine administration can be useful treatment adjuncts for vasospasm following aSAH, especially in cases refractory to conventional forms of treatment. However, larger, controlled clinical trials are warranted.

ID SPINAL INFECTION; SUBDURAL EMPYEMA; ADVERSE EVENTS; CHRONIC PAIN;
   SPONDYLODISCITIS; BONE
AB BACKGROUND: Acupuncture is a common form of alternative medicine that is used for pain control among other modalities of treatment. It is a relatively safe procedure, but complications, including those of infectious etiology, may still occur.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 47-year-old immunosuppressed woman presented with fever, altered level of consciousness, dysphasia, and a left occipital subgaleal fluctuant mass after acupuncture for headaches in the same area. Imaging demonstrated subgaleal and epidural collection localized in the left occipital region. She underwent urgent surgical evacuation of both collections. Cultures from intraoperative specimens grew Streptococcus anginosus. The patient started targeted antibiotic treatment leading to complete recovery.
   CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first report of intracranial abscess after acupuncture. Given the worldwide application of this alternative treatment, physicians, acupuncturists, and the general public should be aware of the possibility of this rare but serious complication.

AB OBJECTIVE: The clinical application of endoscopic techniques for lumbar lateral recess stenosis (LRS) is still challenging. This study aimed to describe a transforaminal endoscopic decompression (TED) technique for LRS and to demonstrate its clinical results.
   METHODS: Two-year follow-up data were collected from 45 consecutive patients who underwent TED for LRS. Full-scale endoscopic decompression was performed in the dorsal and ventral aspects of the lateral recess with combined partial pediculectomy using an articulating bone burr and endoscopic instruments. Surgical outcomes were evaluated using the Visual Analog Pain Score (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and modified Macnab criteria.
   RESULTS: The mean age of the 27 female and 18 male patients was 64.9 years. The mean VAS for leg pain and mean ODI improved from 7.93 and 75.87 at baseline to 1.71 and 17.87, respectively, at 2 years after surgery (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively). Based on the modified Macnab criteria, excellent or good results were obtained in 86.7% of the patients, and symptomatic improvements were obtained in 97.8%. One patient underwent revision surgery because of incomplete decompression, and 2 experienced transient dysesthesia.
   CONCLUSION: TED with the patient under local anesthesia can be effective for the treatment of LRS, especially for the elderly or patients at a high risk for general anesthesia.

TI Surgical Strategies and Clinical Results of Site-Specific Treatment
   Using High-Flow Bypass for Ruptured Blood Blister-Like Anterior Wall
   Aneurysms of the Internal Carotid Artery
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY

DT Article
DE Blister aneurysm; High-flow bypass; Subarachnoid hemorrhage
ID SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE; DISSECTING ANEURYSM; NONBRANCHING SITES; GRAFT
AB OBJECTIVE: Surgical treatment of ruptured blood blister-like aneurysms (BBAs) arising from the internal carotid artery (ICA) is challenging. We retrospectively reviewed the results of our surgical strategies tailored for each aneurysm site.
   METHODS: All ruptured ICA BBAs treated between 2003 and 2015 were reviewed. Aneurysms on the lateral side of the ICA were classified as type A, on the medial side of C2 as type B, and on the medial side of C1 as type C. The principal strategy was high-flow bypass (HFB) by use of a radial artery graft, with clipping, trapping, or proximal occlusion selected on the basis of aneurysm type. The results of each treatment were examined.
   RESULTS: This study included 20 patients. There were 11 type A aneurysms (55%), 2 type B (10%), and 7 type C (35%). HFB was used in 13 patients (65%) and low-flow bypass in 4 (20%). Except for 1 case, no other cases of rerupture or recurrence occurred. Severe ischemia due to cerebral vasospasm was confirmed in 4 of 20 patients (20%), 3 of whom had not received HFB. Modified Rankin Scale score was 0e2 in 16 of 20 patients (80%).
   CONCLUSION: Inadequate cerebral blood flow is a distinct possibility even with HFB, so parent artery flow should be preserved to protect against ischemia whenever possible. However, if preservation of the anterior choroidal artery or posterior communicating artery during clipping or trapping is difficult, HFB combined with occlusion of the proximal portion of the ICA in the neck is a feasible option.

AB OBJECTIVE: Cranial fasciitis is a rare benign mass that typically presents in pediatric patients from 3 weeks to 6 years of age. It is classified as a subset of nodular fasciitis and was first reported in 1980. This study evaluates the literature for common characteristics that may affect diagnosis and treamtent.
   METHODS: We describe the case of a 13-month-old girl with a history of accidental head trauma 7 months before presentation and the case of a 5-month-old girl with an expansile skull lesion. We also performed a systematic review of the reported data on cranial fasciitis, including a total of 57 reported studies with 80 unique cases.
   RESULTS: There were 80 total cases reviewed in the literature. There was a male predominence, 1.75:1. The average age at presentation was 5.2 years. The most common causes for this lesion were idiopathic (65%), blunt trauma (14%) and radiation therapy (7%). Overall, there was a 9% recurrence rate following treatment.
   CONCLUSION: We report the characteristics at presentation, including, to the best of our knowledge, the first account of gender differences, and the treatment modalities used in the included studies and the implications in relation to the recurrence rates.

AB BACKGROUND: When it comes to autogenous nerve grafting, the sural and great auricular nerve (GAN) are the 2 nerves predominately used for trigeminal and facial nerve repair. Arising from the second and third cervical ventral rami, the GAN emerges from the posterior border of the sternocleidomastoid coursing superiorly and anteriorly toward the ear.
   METHODS: Eleven sides from 5 Caucasian and 1 Asian cadaveric heads (all fresh-frozen) were used. One man and 5 women were used with an age at death ranging from 57 to 91 years, with a mean of 80.3 years. Measurements were made from the inferior border of the ear to the GAN, the GAN to the external jugular vein, and the inferior border of the mastoid process to the GAN; the proximal, medial, and distal diameters of the GAN and the length of the GAN that was obtained from this exposure were also measured.
   RESULTS: The mean distance from the inferior border of the mastoid process to the GAN, inferior border of the ear to the GAN, and GAN to the external jugular vein was 27.71, 31.03, and 13.28 mm, respectively. The mean length of the GAN was 74.86 mm. The mean diameter of its distal, middle, and proximal portions was 1.51, 1.38, and 1.58 mm, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: The GAN is an excellent option for use in nerve grafting for repair of, for example, facial dysfunction. In this study, we review our measurements, techniques for identification, and dissecting techniques for the GAN. The proximity to the operative area and minimal complications associated with GAN grafting might contribute to improved patient satisfaction and better outcomes regarding functional restoration.

ID HEADACHE; PAIN; COMPLICATIONS; SUBSTITUTE; EFFICACY; MATER
AB BACKGROUND: Dural closure is a routine surgical step in neurosurgery. The benefit of suturing the dura to achieve watertight closure-with or without the use of dural substitutes-has been questioned in supratentorial craniotomy. We performed a retrospective study to examine the possible benefits and harms of suturing the dura compared with no dural closure and the occurrence of postoperative infection, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak, and postcraniotomy headaches.
   METHODS: We performed a retrospective study to compare the incidence of CSF leak, infection, surgical site swelling, and postcraniotomy headaches between patients with watertight dural closure (closed group) and patients without watertight dural closure (open group). Any method used to close the dura and to achieve watertight closure was included, whether primary or secondary closure (with or without using suturable dural substitute).
   RESULTS: Overall, 216 patients were included in the present study, with 112 patients in the open group and 114 in the closed group. The open group experienced a greater incidence of infection and CSF leak (6 in the open group vs. 2 in the closed group), but without statistical significance (P = 0.15). We found no difference in surgical site swelling (P = 0.29). However, the closed group showed a greater association with the development of postcraniotomy headaches (P = 0.001).
   CONCLUSION: We found no difference in the occurrence of CSF leak, infection, or surgical site swelling between the closed and open groups. The incidence of postcraniotomy headaches was greater in the closed group, and the difference was statistically significant.

ID 3RD VENTRICLE; MICROSURGICAL TREATMENT; RESECTION; MANAGEMENT;
   EXPERIENCE; SERIES
AB BACKGROUND: The main criticism of endoscopic excision of colloid cysts of the third ventricle is the decreased ability to completely resect the cyst wall, therefore increasing the risk of recurrence. The extent of resection varies widely across the endoscopic series and is largely influenced by the surgical technique. We report the results of the rotational technique for endoscopic transforaminal excision of colloid cysts in a series of consecutive patients. Our objective is to contribute to the current literature and to shed more light on an effective and safe yet less commonly used technique.
   METHODS: Retrospective analysis was performed on 19 patients. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was evaluated for cyst characteristics. Postoperative MRI was evaluated for residual cyst membranes. Operative records were reviewed for residual cyst components. Excision grade was determined based on the Barrow Neurological Institute grading scale. Symptom resolution was documented clinically.
   RESULTS: The study included 13 men and 6 women, with a mean age of 35 years (range, 19-56 years) and mean follow-up of 27.74 months (range, 4-55 months). Total excision was achieved in 17 of 19 cysts (89.5%). A small residual was seen intraoperatively but not radiographically in 1 patient. In another patient, residual cyst membrane seen intraoperatively and radiologically led to recurrence 18 months postoperatively. No mortalities or permanent morbidities occurred.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our high total excision rate and low complication profile are in concordance with the recent reports of endoscopic resection of colloid cysts. The rotational technique for the endoscopic transforaminal approach is highly effective and a safe alternative to the bimanual dissection technique.

AB BACKGROUND: Although previous studies have reported cases of coexistence of carotid-ophthalmic aneurysm and ophthalmic artery (OA) infundibulum, the hemodynamic characteristics of this complicated structure and its damaging effects on vision remain to be elucidated. The aim of the present study was to analyze this artery structure using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques.
   METHODS: We have presented the case of a patient with a diagnosis of carotid-ophthalmic aneurysm, who had been experiencing blurred vision. A transient analysis was performed to investigate the blood flowing in the parent artery. Hemodynamic parameters such as streamline, wall shear stress (WSS), oscillatory shear index (OSI), and relative residence time were obtained.
   RESULTS: When the inlet velocity of the parent artery was at the second peak, the flow rate and intensity of the vortex reached their maximum. In the aneurysm neck, a region of high time-averaged WSS (TAWSS) and a region of low TAWSS with a high OSI coexisted. In addition, a relaxation area was found. In the aneurysm dome, the minimum TAWSS was 2.5 Pa, the maximum OSI was 0.48, and the 2 regions did not overlap. In the OA infundibulum, the maximum OSI and relative residence time were 0.47 and 39.2, respectively; the minimum TAWSS was 0.59 Pa.
   CONCLUSIONS: We detected aneurysm regions that were susceptible to further expansion and assessed the rupture risk of each region. The relaxation area could promote aneurysm progression. In addition, the location of the vortex shear force center varied with time. Finally, double vortex streamlines influenced the blood supply through the OA, impairing the vision. Infundibulum might promote thrombus formation and, hence, retard OA blood flow.

ID INTERNAL CAROTID-ARTERY; OCCLUSION; ANEURYSM; PATIENT; TONSILLECTOMY;
   COMPLICATION; SECONDARY; STROKE
AB BACKGROUND: Arterial pseudoaneurysms of the neck are rarely reported in the pediatric population and no dedicated large series are available. Trauma and infection are the most common causes for these aneurysms, with congenital and collagen vascular disorders being the less common causes. These lesions can be life threatening, especially when they present with bleeding or airway compromise.
   METHODS: We searched our radiology information system for all cases of pediatric neck aneurysm presented between June 2015 and May 2018. These cases were analyzed for clinicoepidemiologic variables, clinical presentation, imaging findings, management, and follow-up.
   RESULTS: Six children were included in the study (male/female ratio, 5:1), with a mean age of 7.8 years (range, 2.5-15 years). Four presented acutely with either bleeding or rapidly enlarging neck swelling, whereas 2 presented with slowly increasing pulsatile swelling. One had a traumatic cause, 2 had infections, and 1 had infective cervical lymphadenitis complicated by iatrogenic injury whereas no definite causative mechanisms could be accounted for in 2 patients. Two of the children were managed by trapping of the aneurysm and 2 only by proximal parent vessel occlusion. The other 2 children were treated with stent graft deployment across the aneurysm neck to reconstruct the parent vessel. All the patients were doing well during the follow-up period (mean, 14.8 months).
   CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular means of treatment for pediatric neck aneurysms is relatively simple and safe. Although parent vessel sacrifice is the gold-standard management, vessel-preserving strategies can be tried in select cases with favorable anatomy.

AB BACKGROUND: Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is the most feared complication of endovascular treatment (EVT) for acute ischemic stroke because of anterior circulation large vessel occlusion (LVO). The purpose of this study was to identify cerebral hemodynamic predictors of ICH and poor outcome in patients with successful recanalization.
   METHODS: Serial transcranial color-coded sonography (TCCS) examinations assessed vessel status and cerebral hemodynamics of 226 (mean age, 69.8 +/- 12.5 years; 130 men [57.5%]) consecutive patients with acute anterior circulation LVO at 48 hours and 1 week after EVT. Middle cerebral artery peak systolic velocity (PSVMCA) and PSVMCA ratio (recanalized PSVMCA/contralateral PSVMCA) were recorded.
   RESULTS: Out of 180 successfully recanalized patients (79.6%), 28 patients (15.5%) had ICH. They more often had arterial hypertension (25/28 [89.3%] vs. 106/152 [69.7%], P = 0.04), a more severe stroke syndrome (18 [range, 10-23] vs. 16 [range, 5-26], P = 0.01), a worse clinical outcome (90-day modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score 3-5: 16/28 [57.1%] vs. 42/152 [27.6%], P = 0.004), and soon after EVT showed a significantly higher mean PSVMCA ratio (3.4 +/- 0.1 vs. 2.4 +/- 0.1, P < 0.0001) than patients without ICH, respectively. In multivariate analysis, early PSVMCA ratio was independently associated with postinterventional ICH (odds ratio, 13.379; 95% confidence interval, 2.466-50.372; P < 0.01). The patients with ICH (19/28 [67.9%]) who resumed normal PSVMCA values at 1 week after EVT had a better outcome (90-day mRS score 0-2: 8/19 [42.1%] vs. 0/9 [0%], respectively).
   CONCLUSIONS: Early TCCS detection of a high PSVMCA ratio in successfully recanalized stroke patients indicates an increased risk of ICH, whereas cerebral hemodynamics normalization at 1 week in patients with postinterventional ICH predicts a relatively better 3-month outcome.

ID CEREBRAL EDEMA; DEXAMETHASONE; MANAGEMENT; TOXICITY
AB BACKGROUND: Dexamethasone is a standard treatment for cerebral edema after brain tumor surgery. However, its side effects can negatively impact the quality and safety of care provided to patients. Sparse evidence exists in the literature regarding postoperative steroid dosing to guide clinicians. The objective of this study was to determine if a new reduced exogenous steroid taper (REST) protocol would effectively treat postoperative cerebral edema while reducing the incidence of steroid-related side effects including diabetes, hypertension, and insomnia.
   METHODS: A REST protocol (dexamethasone 38.5 mg tapered over 10 days) was instituted for patients with postoperative brain tumor of a single surgeon. Historical controls treated with a high-dose taper (dexamethasone 117 mg taper over 17 days) were selected to match for baseline characteristics. Outcomes of new or worsened diabetes, hypertension, and insomnia, as well as length of stay (LOS) and 30-day readmission rates, were compared.
   RESULTS: Twenty-five patients were included in each group. There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics. The REST group received a median of 34.5 mg (interquartile range, 32-41 mg) of dexamethasone, whereas controls received 43 mg (interquartile range, 16-91 mg) (P = 0.04). There was a significant reduction in the incidence of new or worsened hypertension in the REST group (0%) compared with controls (20%, P = 0.02). No difference was seen in the rates of diabetes mellitus, insomnia, LOS, or 30-day readmission rates.
   CONCLUSIONS: A reduced steroid taper after brain tumor surgery significantly reduced the incidence of hypertension without increasing LOS or 30-day readmissions compared with controls treated with a high-dose taper.

TI Venous Thromboembolism After Degenerative Spine Surgery: A Nationwide
   Readmissions Database Analysis

   THROMBOSIS; COMPLICATIONS; DISEASE; PATIENT; NEUROSURGERY; PROPHYLAXIS
AB BACKGROUND: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is an appreciable burden on health care. The protracted recumbency experienced by many spinal patients juxtaposed with concerns for postoperative hemorrhage from early anticoagulation results in conflicting stances regarding chemoprophylaxis. Identifying risk factors associated with VTE is therefore instrumental in guiding management.
   OBJECTIVE: To identify VTE risk factors in patients undergoing degenerative spine surgery.
   METHODS: The Nationwide Readmissions Database was searched for adults undergoing spine surgery for degenerative diseases between 2010 and 2014. The 30-day and 90-day VTE incidence was estimated from readmissions with new VTE diagnoses. A multivariate survey-adjusted logistic regression model was used to identify variables associated with VTE diagnoses on readmission.
   RESULTS: Of 838,507 degenerative spine cases queried, 3499 patients (0.42%) were readmitted with a VTE diagnosis within 30 days and 4321 patients (0.62%) were readmitted within 90 days. In multivariate analysis, steroids were independently associated with a higher likelihood of readmission with VTE at both 30 days (odds ratio, 1.58; P < 0.001) and 90 days (odds ratio, 1.97; P < 0.001). Significant associations were also identified with thoracolumbar surgery, length of stay, and discharge to institutional care.
   CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of readmission with VTE diagnoses in spine surgery is low. However, their devastating consequences underscore the need to identify those patients deemed high risk. These patients include those having thoracolumbar surgery, of advanced age, with prolonged length of stay, using corticosteroids, and with a disposition to institutional care (e.g., skilled nursing facility or long-term acute care). Given the association between steroids and VTE, clinicians should be judicious about perioperative administration despite their obvious antiinflammatory benefits.

AB OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyze practice trends in specific intracranial bypass types in a large, consecutive bypass experience.
   METHODS: This retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database included all intracranial bypasses performed by a single surgeon over 21 years. Bypass types were grouped into 7 categories and analyzed in seven 3-year time intervals: type 1 = extracranial-to-intracranial (EC-IC) bypass with scalp arteries as donors; type 2 = EC-IC bypass with interposition graft to cervical carotid arteries; type 3 = arterial reimplantation; type 4 = in situ bypass; type 5 = reanastomosis; type 6 = intracranial-to-intracranial bypass with interposition graft; and type 7 = combination bypass.
   RESULTS: In total, 598 intracranial bypasses were performed including 359 type 1, 59 type 2, 24 type 3, 30 type 4, 37 type 5, 36 type 6, and 53 type 7. Although type 1 and type 3-7 bypasses increased, type 2 bypasses decrease in frequency. Aneurysms were the most common bypass indication (41.8%), followed by moyamoya disease (31.8%), and intracranial arterial stenosis or occlusion (24.9%). Endovascular treatment failure was observed in 10.8% of the aneurysm patients treated with a bypass procedure.
   CONCLUSIONS: Intracranial bypass remains an essential technique for open vascular neurosurgeons. The classic low-flow EC-IC bypasses, intracranial-to-intracranial, and combination bypasses increased over time, whereas the high-flow EC-IC interpositional bypasses decreased over time. These trends reflect the increasing use of flow diverters as well as the need for surgical revascularization for complex aneurysms, and those that failed previous endovascular therapy.

TI Single-Barrel Versus Double-Barrel Superficial Temporal Artery to Middle
   Cerebral Artery Bypass: A Comparative Analysis
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Double barrel; Extracranial-intracranial bypass; Microsurgical
   treatment; Single barrel; Superficial temporal artery to middle cerebral
   artery (STA-MCA)
AB OBJECTIVE: The superficial temporal artery to middle cerebral artery (STA-MCA) bypass is the most common bypass for augmenting or restoring cerebral blood flow. Although the single-barrel (SB) STA-MCA bypass is sufficient in most cases, the double-barrel (DB) STA-MCA bypass can supply the demands of different vascular territories or multiple efferent arteries. We present a comparative analysis of SB and DB STA-MCA bypass in a large, consecutive series to examine indications, surgical results, and patient outcomes.
   METHODS: A retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database identified all STA-MCA bypasses performed by a single surgeon over 21 years.
   RESULTS: In total, 261 patients received 378 STA-MCA bypasses in 351 surgeries. SB STA-MCA bypasses were performed in 234 patients (90%), whereas DB STA-MCA bypasses were performed in 27 patients (10%). Patients with DB STA-MCA bypasses were more likely to undergo bilateral bypass procedures than those receiving SB STAMCA bypass (P < 0.0001). In patients with bilateral STAMCA bypasses (n = 91, 35%), 69 patients received bilateral SB STA-MCA bypasses (76%), whereas 22 patients received a DB STA-MCA bypass on 1 hemisphere (24%). There was no difference in bypass patency or clinical outcome in patients with SB and DB STA-MCA bypasses.
   CONCLUSIONS: DB STA-MCA bypasses are reserved for patients requiring revascularization of multiple vascular territories or efferent arteries. DB STA-MCA bypasses have patency rates and patient outcomes comparable to SB STAMCA, with the advantages of a single incision and reduced operative complexity compared to high-flow bypasses. DB STA-MCA bypass is an important element in the vascular neurosurgeon's bypass armamentarium.

   PREDICTORS; MANAGEMENT; HYPOXIA; DISEASE
AB OBJECTIVE: We created a neck trauma model by injecting blood into the sheath of rabbits' carotid bodies (CBs). Then we determined the relationship between neuronal degeneration of the CB due to hemorrhage of this organ and its clinical effects such as blood pH and heart rhythm.
   METHODS: The present study included 24 adult male New Zealand rabbits. The animals were divided into 3 groups: control (n = 5); sham (0.5 mL saline injected into CBs; n = 5); and study (CB trauma model; n = 14). pH values and heart rhythms were recorded before the experiment to determine the values under normal conditions, and measurements were repeated thrice in the days following the experiment. The number of normal and degenerated neuron density of CBs was counted. The relationship between the blood pH values, heart rhythms, and degenerated neuron densities was analyzed.
   RESULTS: Heart rhythms were 218 +/- 20 in the control group, 197 +/- 16 in the sham group (P = 0.09), and 167 +/- 13 in the study group (P < 0.0005). pH values were 7.40 +/- 0.041 in the control group, 7.321 +/- 0.062 in the sham group (P = 0.203), and 7.23 +/- 0.02 in study group (P < 0.0005). Degenerated neuron densities were 12 +/- 4/mm(3) in the control group, 430 +/- 74/mm(3) in the sham group (P < 0.005), and 7434 +/- 810/mm(3) in the study group (P < 0.0001).
   CONCLUSIONS: A high degenerate neuron density in the CB can decrease blood pH and hearth rhythm after neck trauma, and there might be a close relationship between the number of degenerated neurons and clinical findings (such as heart rhythm and blood pH). This relationship suggests that injury to the glossopharyngeal nerve-CB network can cause acidosis by disturbing the breathing-circulating reflex and results in respiratory acidosis.

ID PITUITARY-TUMORS; SYSTEM; NAVIGATION; MICROSCOPE; NEURONAVIGATION;
   REGISTRATION; INTEGRATION
AB OBJECTIVE: We investigated how augmented reality (AR) can be applied to support transsphenoidal surgery.
   METHODS: AR was established using the head-up displays integrated into operating microscopes. Navigation registration was performed with either fiducial-based or automatic registration using intraoperative computed tomography (iCT). Correct microscope calibration was ensured by checking the geometric overlap between the AR representation of the reference array and the 3-dimensional reality while focusing on the reference array.
   RESULTS: From a consecutive single-surgeon series of 288 transsphenoidal procedures, 47 patients (16.3%) had undergone microscope-based AR to visualize the target and risk structures. AR was smoothly integrated into the surgical workflow. AR accuracy depended on navigation accuracy and microscope calibration. The target registration error in patients with fiducial-based registration was 2.33 +/- 1.30 mm. Automatic, user-independent iCT-based registration significantly (P < 0.001) increased AR accuracy (target registration error, 0.83 +/- 0.44 mm). Applying low-dose iCT protocols reduced the effective dose caused by iCT registration scanning to within the range of a single chest radiograph (0.041 mSv). No vascular injuries and no aggravation of neurological deficits occurred in the present series. AR greatly facilitated orientation in the reoperations and the patients with anatomical variants, thereby increasing surgeon comfort. Enhanced AR visualizations improved the 3-dimensional perception compared with the standard display of dashed lines by the head-up display of the operating microscope.
   CONCLUSIONS: Microscope-based AR is a reliable tool to increase patient safety in complicated transsphenoidal procedures. Intraoperative imaging-based automatic patient registration is recommended.

AB OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of underlying liver disease on 30-day postoperative complications after elective posterior lumbar fusion (PLF).
   METHODS: We performed a retrospective American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program study of patients who had undergone elective PLF from 2011 to 2014. The patients were divided into 2 groups stratified by the presence of liver disease, assessed using the Model for End-stage Liver Disease plus sodium score (liver disease, >= 10; no liver disease, <10). The baseline patient and operative characteristics were compared between the 2 groups using univariate analysis. Subsequent multivariate regression analysis adjusted for differences in baseline characteristics was performed to identify 30-day postoperative complications independently associated with liver disease.
   RESULTS: Of 2965 patients, 55.9% had underlying liver disease. Those with liver disease were more frequently aged >65 years, male, and underweight or overweight and had had American Society of Anesthesiologists class >= 3, diabetes, pulmonary comorbidity, cardiac comorbidity, renal comorbidity, bleeding disorder, preoperative dyspnea at rest, and a prolonged operative time. On univariate analysis, patients with liver disease had a greater incidence of cardiac complications, pulmonary complications, renal complications, blood transfusion, sepsis, urinary tract infection, and prolonged hospitalization. On adjusted multivariate regression analysis, liver disease was independently associated with renal complications, pulmonary complications, sepsis, urinary tract infection, prolonged hospitalization, and blood transfusion.
   CONCLUSIONS: As the long-term survival of patients with liver disease continues to increase, a better understanding of the relationship between liver dysfunction and surgical outcomes is needed. The identification of modifiable risk factors would allow them to be addressed and optimized preoperatively to decrease the incidence and severity of complications and improve patient outcomes after PLF.

ID BRAIN-INJURY; PROGRESSION
AB BACKGROUND: Fall with head injury is a pervasive challenge, especially in the aging population. Contributing factors for mortality include the development of cerebral contusions and delayed traumatic intracerebral hematoma. Currently, there is no established specific treatment for these conditions.
   OBJECT: This study aimed to investigate the impact of independent factors on the mortality rate of traumatic brain injury with contusions or traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage.
   METHODS: Data were collected from consecutive patients admitted for cerebral contusions or traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage at an academic trauma center from 2010 to 2016. The primary outcome was the 30-day mortality rate. Independent factors for analysis included patient factors and treatment modalities. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to identify independent factors related to mortality. Secondary outcomes included thromboembolic complication rates associated with the use of tranexamic acid.
   RESULTS: In total, 651 consecutive patients were identified. For the patient factors, low Glasgow Coma Scale on admission, history of renal impairment, and use of warfarin were identified as independent factors associated with higher mortality from univariate and multivariate analyses. For the treatment modalities, univariate analysis identified tranexamic acid as an independent factor associated with lower mortality (P = 0.021). Thromboembolic events were comparable in patients with or without tranexamic acid.
   CONCLUSION: Tranexamic acid was identified by univariate analysis as an independent factor associated with lower mortality in cerebral contusions or traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage. Further prospective studies are needed to validate this finding.

AB BACKGROUND: Cranioplasty is a relatively simple and straightforward intervention; however, it is associated with a high incidence of postoperative seizures. Postcranioplasty seizures, especially early seizures, are common and associated with poor outcomes and longer hospital stays. Protocols for preventing and managing early seizures have not been well established.
   METHODS: The medical records of 595 patients who underwent cranioplasty were retrospectively reviewed. Of these patients, 259 had preexisting seizures and 336 had no seizures before cranioplasty. Prophylactic antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) were administered to patients who had no seizures before cranioplasty for 1 week, whereas an advanced AED regimen was administered to patients with preexisting seizures. Subsequently, clinical characteristics, occurrence of recurrent seizures, early seizures, and postoperative complications were analyzed.
   RESULTS: Our previous study showed positive results for prophylaxis in new-onset early seizures. In the patients with preexisting seizures, 46.7% of the patients (121/259) experienced recurrent seizures after cranioplasty and 17.4% of the patients (45/259) experienced early recurrent seizures within 1 week of their operation. In the group who received the advanced AEDs, early recurrent seizures were significantly reduced to 8.7% compared with the regular group (20.5%; P = 0.027). Younger age and preoperative hydrocephalus engendered a higher risk of recurrent seizures. The number of previous craniotomies was observed to have a trend of increasing early recurrent seizures.
   CONCLUSIONS: Cranioplasty is associated with a high incidence of postoperative seizures. Our management protocol for postcranioplasty seizures includes seizure prophylaxis and advanced use of AEDs, which can reduce the occurrence of early seizures.

AB BACKGROUND: Complete pathogenesis of hemifacial spasm (HFS) is unknown. In some patients with HFS, thickened, opaque, and sticky arachnoid membranes have been found during microvascular decompression procedures. This phenomenon indicates a possible relationship between inflammation and HFS. The aim of this study was to explore the role of inflammation in pathogenesis of HFS.
   METHODS: Levels of interferon-gamma, interleukin-2 receptor, interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8, interleukin-10, and tumor necrosis factor alpha and white blood cell (WBC), neutrophil, and lymphocyte counts were compared between patients with HFS, patients with lumbar disc herniation, and healthy control subjects. A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to evaluate the diagnostic significance of peripheral blood inflammatory markers for HFS. All the inflammatory markers were further analyzed by single and multiple logistic regression analysis.
   RESULTS: Patients with HFS had greater IL-6, interleukin-8, white blood cell count, and neutrophil count than patients with lumbar disc herniation and healthy control subjects. Area under curve values of IL-6, white blood cell count, and neutrophil count were >0.8. Multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that only interleukin-2 receptor and IL-6 were relevant to HFS.
   CONCLUSIONS: Inflammation is relative to HFS. IL-6 may be 1 of many factors involved in pathogenesis of HFS.

AB OBJECTIVE: To compare the outcome of anterior cervical decompression and fusion (ACDF) and posterior laminoplasty (LAMP) for treating 4-level cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM).
   METHODS: Data of 80 patients with 4-level CSM treated using ACDF and another 56 cases treated using LAMP were retrospectively analyzed. Radiologic outcomes evaluated by C2-7 Cobb angle and cervical range of motion (ROM) and functional outcomes evaluated by Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) scale score and visual analog scale score for axial pain were compared between the 2 groups.
   RESULTS: JOA scale score in both groups improved significantly after operation (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the JOA scale score improvement rate between the 2 groups (P > 0.05). The C2-7 Cobb angle increased significantly in the ACDF group (P < 0.05) and decreased in the LAMP group (P > 0.05). There was a significant difference in C2-7 Cobb angle improvement between the 2 groups (P < 0.05). Cervical ROM decreased in both groups after operation (P < 0.05), but there was no significant difference in ROM loss ratio between the 2 groups (P > 0.05). Blood loss in the LAMP group was significantly more than in the ACDF group (P < 0.05); however, there was no significant difference in operation time between the 2 groups (P > 0.05). There was no significant difference in the complication rate between the 2 groups (P > 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: Both ACDF and LAMP were effective in the treatment of multilevel CSM. Compared with LAMP, ACDF is less invasive and may be more suitable for elderly patients with poor tolerance of surgery.
